 | He caught up with Amos who had paused near the Arizona booth to catch his breath . " Thanks , boss ! " " Never mind that . Waste any plates ? " " Nall . Unloaded all the time . " " That 's what you get kidding them you 're taking their picture . Now get started on group shots of the Lonely Hearts in front of their home state booths . " " All forty-eight ? " protested the lazy cameraman . " Complaining ? " " No , no , boss . Forty-eight ? Forty-eight . " " Right . Old sweethearts finding each other , new romances , triangles . Give me contrast . " Amos turned to leave when he was recalled and introduced to a Hungarian giant . " This is Walther Zcekely , " said Carl . " A setup . I 'll announce the act later .

" He motioned with both hands to the Lonely Hearts to line up in front of their booths , while assistants rushed about , echoing his orders .  | Carl strode through the crowd . Near the platform he turned , eyes snapping as he plotted a fresh exploitation stunt . He caught sight of a healthy specimen of manhood standing a few feet away from him , and wondered if his figure was as well cut as the Michigan flunky 's . He drew in his stomach self-consciously .

He stood five feet eight inches in his stocking feet but preferred to measure his status by inches of newsprint and gains in the circulation field . Now in his forties , by his own standard , he grew wondrously tall . It would have been bad , he thought , if he had n't been able to live up to the cocky assurance he had exhibited in those Chronicle days . That was how he was  --  different from all the others . He was born a rebel . He had never been content to be the best rewrite man on Park Row . Had n't he seen what happened to faithful rewrites ? To grizzly war-horses of the slot ? To leg-men who suffered from varicose veins and reporters who dreaded the stomach pump ?

Was n't he entitled to a break ? He had great plans . That was why he had come to New York in the first place : to get a break , to get a fresh start . " Where do you come from , Carl ? " she asked as he spent his last dollar on wine . He rambled on , evading the question . He felt very low . . . . The day the New York Globe was murdered , he was lifted into one of the big jobs of Manhattan journalism  --  the city editorship of the New York Cornet , newcomer to the wayward press . To embark on something new proved simple for him , for he had a jungleful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripsnorting time adjusting himself to his new job , to his new life . He found a boisterous roughhousing staff and licked it into a fanatically loyal news machine by daily , hourly repetition of his favorite slogan , " Lots of socko ! " In the beginning the Comet had been a halfhearted challenge to the other papers , but his brains were the timely transfusion that saved its life . He had to battle envious desk-men over half-baked features . He tasted revolt , slammed his fist on the desk and bawled orders , terrifying them into submission . Men feared him , men respected him , and his worst foes conceded his capacity . But few loved him . Headlines were big and bold , but not as big and bold as he saw them . He had no friends in those bitter days when he was king of the city room , his crown still glistening , a blue pencil in one hand and an aspirin tablet in the other  --  until he immortalized himself  | as a husband and father with , " I 'M GLAD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The day Tommy was born he was promised a bonus for every hundred thousand increase he showed in the Comet 's circulation . He worked hard , sat late at his desk , coat off , sleeves rolled up . . . . His first love was the paper . His second , his home . But he had discovered the formula for complete contentment and never lost this harmony of desk and home . He guarded it jealously , prepared to defend it , ready to battle anyone who dared rob him of a precious part of it . Life was complete to him . Then he made rivals scratch their smug heads and whistle when he founded the Comet Lonely Hearts Club . Circulation mounted quickly , steadily . He became journalism 's white-haired boy and recieved flattering offers from other publications . But he remained loyal to the Comet . He could afford to be loyal now . And then he promoted the Lonely Hearts Ball . The Garden was sold out . He smiled , rocking back and forth on heel and toe . Now he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his swivel chair , his own home .

Two words that threatened to strip him of his power , glory and happiness . " John Grant ! "  | Two Carl whirled about . He could see nothing but black eyes staring at him  --  strange , hypnotic , penetrating . There was something vaguely familiar and frightening about them . . . . Take it easy . I 'm just tired . Too much work before the ball . Just nerves , that 's all . I checked . They told me she was dead . She 's dead . He took a step backward . An illusion ? The woman with the black eyes stepped forward . A reality . Reality seized his wrist . " John , it 's you . It is you ! " The whisper came from a throat choked with tears .

" The word had shot out of his mouth before he could prevent it . Now it was too late for denial . Silence answered him . Her fingers dug into his flesh .  | She was trying to speak . She found her voice again , thankful , shaking , low . " John ! " People and booths and pennants and Biddle 's flashes began to take form again to Carl . He looked around quickly . I 've got to get her out of here ! No one was paying attention to them . He gripped her arm and pushed through the throng toward the rear exit leading out to the alley . Someone brushed past her and she stumbled . The button on Carl 's sleeve tangled with the red string attached to her dress over her heart  --  the Lonely Hearts Club card . He freed his arm and pushed ahead . They plunged into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question and she mumbled an answer . Good ; she did n't live far , just a half-dozen blocks down the street . He helped her into his coupe and drove off . He needed gas . Funny , how you think of a silly thing like gas when you " That 's it , John . The one with the light . " He stopped in front of a tenement , followed her stiffly up the cheap stairs  --  there seemed to be thousands . Outside a door on the second floor , she fumbled with her purse . The sound of a key in the lock and the opening of a door reached his ears in the dark . He felt her walk past him . She hesitated , groped in the inky blackness above her head and found the electric cord . " Come in , John . " It was damp ; a smell of medicine nauseated him .  | She must be sick , he thought . He closed the door and turned slowly ; walking as if he were in a nightmare to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patched shade as an elevated train stampeded past , arm 's distance away . Her eyes did not leave him as he made a slow circle . At last he turned to look at her . She was wearing a black dress greenish with age . She had put on a crisp white organdy collar and bow in a pathetic effort to look smart . He was glad that he could pity her and that pity could be so impersonal . She misunderstood his silence . " I  --  I 've changed , " she said apologetically . " Have n't I ? " What could he say ? To him she was a skeleton in a closet he had locked , bolted , barred . He had thrown the key away , he had forgotten where . He had found contentment and peace in forgetting . She was crying . Somehow tears had always become her . She swayed . For a moment he thought she was going to fall . He helped her to the bed and the snap of a spring reacted to her weight . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't hold them both . " Why , John ? Why ? " she asked in a whisper . Tell her . Tell her . But he did n't . He felt her eyes devour him . She took his hands in hers and gently guided him down to the bed beside her . He studied her hands . They were n't smooth and pink as he remembered them ; it was hard to believe they could be so bony and rough and dry . A flood of memories overwhelmed him . How many  | times had they sat together like this ? For a moment anguish gripped him ; he would have renounced his career and all he possessed to be twenty years younger enjoying a stroll with her near Holy Cross in Worcester . You know you would n't , not for all the money in the world . She withdrew her hands slowly . " The night you left me . . . " She held up her wrists so that he could see the scars that crossed them .

I was lonely . Oh , so lonely ! I had to find out why you ran off . I had a right to know . I must know . " " Charlotte , I 'm married . " He felt her fingers grow cold . He got up and began a caged pacing . Then he told her  --  how he had changed his name to Carl Chapman , how he had struggled and dreamed and how he had met Rose and finally realized his ambition . " I 'm happy , Charlotte . You would n't know what that means . You never saw me happy . I have a home , a name , a future . " There , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Right to the point . Get it over with . I 'll manage her . Finally she spoke . He strained to catch the word . " Married ? " He waited . She looked up slowly ; eyes of pain met  | his . The elevated roared by , vibrating through the room . She rose , steadying herself against the bedpost . " What about me ? I 'm your wife . " No , Charlotte , you were never my wife . We stood up together and said words and you called me husband and I called you wife , but you were never my wife . You were too possessive . Always yours . Always yours . I was in a rut and you kept pulling me down . The more you liked me , the more I disliked you . The more you encouraged me , the less ambitious I became . You bored me . You irritated me . Your slightest touch nauseated me . I could n't stand you another moment . I had to leave you . I had to drive you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were never my wife . He said , " Charlotte , I have two children . " " I do n't care about them . You belong to me ! " Look at her . Still the same Charlotte . Selfish . Mine ! Mine ! Twenty years and no change . Hanging on . Hanging on . " There was one thing I would n't pawn ! " She thrust out her left hand . The light above caught the band on her finger . The wedding ring winked at him . She seized his arms in a frantic grasp . " Why did you leave me , John ? What did I do ? You meant everything to me . I never hurt you . I loved you . I never stopped loving you . " He could n't take his eyes from her haggard face . " You did n't get a divorce . You could n't , John . " " They told me you were dead , " he said . But she was deaf to that . " We 're married . We 're married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There was a  | savage sting to his words . " John Grant is dead . Everything connected with John Grant is dead . Everything . You must understand . " " Understand ? " she cried . " You 're still my husband . I 've never given up hope of finding you . Understand ? You should show a little understanding for your wife . For your real wife ! " She tugged at the Lonely Hearts card hanging over her heart . " Do you understand this ? Do you understand the hell I 've been through ; how low I 've fallen to seek companionship in a club  --  in a lonely hearts club  --  in your club ? " The three words choked her . She coughed and he turned his eyes away , shivering , pitying her . He had to stop this . He straightened with a gesture of finality . " Charlotte , I love my wife . I love my family . Nothing can make me give them up . Nothing . We must be sensible . " " Sensible ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part . ' You deserted me ! Do you call that sensible ? I want my chance now . I deserve it . " He became aware of a change in the temper of his thoughts . His pity for her was swept aside by impatience . " I have money , Charlotte . . . " She was kissing his hands . . . . you can go away . I know a doctor in Bermuda who will ? " She sprang away . Her eyes glared and her voice was a sword swinging . " You cheat ! You fraud ! You liar ! " " Charlotte ! " " I 'll tell them . I 'll tell them who you really are .  | I 'll tell them about the woman you 're living with ! I 'll tell . . . I 'll tell . . . I 'll tell . . .

She clutched his coat . Her ringed fist missed his face . In him he felt the passions of a stranger , a man he did n't know , and his fist struck the side of her head . She fell backward with a howl of terror . His mouth was acid ; he had lost his tongue . There was an empty silence in the room as he tried to cry her name . She was on the floor , motionless . A pain shot through his head . He saw himself striking her and buried his head in trembling hands , but the picture raced before him in his mind , vivid , horrifying . He had struck her again and again , no longer trying merely to keep her from the door or from exposing him ; trying only to destroy her . Again he cried her name and again there was silence and she was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron foot of the bed . He bent over her . Fear and relief swept him .

He was still crouching . Panic seized him . I 've got to get out of here ! But his feet had grown to the floor ; he could not move . . . Only his hands were mobile . With his handkerchief one was wiping the blood from the fingers of the other , carefully , one by one . They were the hands of a stranger . Their action released him . He was Carl Chapman ! Carl Chapman had nothing to fear , there was nothing Carl Chapman could not do ! He had but to think . . . to think . . . He forced himself to look at the body . Once again panic : Run ! Get out . Get out . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inch by inch ; he saw it in its minutest detail . . . He must rehearse every step , every particular  --  then he would act . The ticking of his watch was loud in his ears . He had a sense of time rushing by him . Hurry ! Hurry ! Still he stood . . . . Now ! Her purse  --  he opened it : a compact , a change purse with three pennies , a quarter and the key to the room , a crumpled package of cigarettes and a book of matches , a lipstick , a comb , a want-ad clipping , a soiled handkerchief , and a pawn ticket . He put that too in his pocket . He went through the bureau drawers starting at the top , searching each one quickly , thoroughly , replacing each article . I changed my name , had to . Smith . Brown . Jones . Good . She 'd be unidentified .  | The last drawer stuck . He pulled at it , shaking it , pushing it up , down . Unreasoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up by this ? He drew out the drawer above it , thrust his fist through and banged the bottom one open . There was nothing in it . The closet  --  bare ; the improvised kitchenette ; under the bed . . . no suitcase anywhere . He turned down the bed , picked up a love story magazine from the floor . Run-down slippers were there . He must remember them . The magazine and the cigarettes and matches from the purse went on the table beside the bed . The slippers . . he carried them into the bathroom , cursing the precious second it took him to find the light cord . A nightgown and an ancient bathrobe were hooked on the door . He draped them over the bathroom chair , placed the slippers near it . He folded a used bathtowel and hung it over the tub-rack . Soap ... Washcloth ... Powder . . . Bath salts ... no bath salts . He plugged the tub drain with the stopper and turned on the tap . Warm water trickled sluggishly . He stood by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knelt and lifted the head . The bruise was dry . Basal fracture .

The wedding ring slipped off easily , she was so thin ; she had had to wind a string around it to keep it on . He pulled off her shoes and flung them across the floor as if she had kicked them off tired feet .  | Then he stripped the body . He stood up . Breathing was difficult . He waited deliberately until his hands stopped trembling and he could swallow . He found a split hanger in the closet , slipped the dress over it and hung it on the open closet door . He took stockings and underwear to the kitchenette sink , drenched them , wrung them out , spread them over the cord stretched from corner to corner . Now the last step . . . . He had rehearsed this so stonily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paralyzed , fighting the horror that welled up in him until he wanted to disgorge . Come on . You were a police reporter once . You covered the morgue . You saw them  --  so many of them  --  all kinds . You ca n't stop now . You ca n't ! Move ! He bent over , hooked his hands under the shoulders and dragged the body into the bathroom . The tub was filling . He lifted the legs and let them drop over the rim of it . He was panting now . Straining every muscle , he lifted the body to a standing position in the tub . Its knees buckled . A foot slipped and the body sagged . For an instant he thought everything was lost . He had to struggle to keep his balance . He set his teeth . Slowly , measuring the distance , he allowed the feet to slide toward the end of the tub . Enough ! His heart heat thickly in his throat as he used all his strength to hold the body up . It must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its head directly over them . That was it . The bruise must be directly over the faucets.  | A moment to steady himself . . . He sprang back . The body dropped . The back of its head struck both faucets with a thud . Its arms flew up . One foot waved crazily and came down with a splash . The flying water spattered the wall , nightgown and robe , dumped the can of talc and filled one of the bedroom slippers . He escaped it . He tiptoed in , avoiding the puddles on the floor and set the soap down in one of them . He was finished . It was done . Back in the bedroom , he straightened his jacket , ran his hands over his hair . Only the continuing purl of water and his own breathing made sound in the apartment . Now he was in a fever to be gone . He opened the door , glanced up and down the dark hallway . He turned to take one last careful look . He must be sure . A flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hearts Club card ! His pulse hammered . If he had forgotten it ! He crossed swiftly to the dress on the closet door , tore the card from it , and went out . As he closed the door , the shattering roar of a passing train came to him for the last time .  | Three The street was empty . Two quick strides took him to the coupe . He drove off . He counted the blocks and pulled up to the curb . There was more he must do . But he had to wait . He locked his teeth against nausea and bowed over the wheel , forehead hard against it , hands clenched around it . Chill after chill shook him . At last he could relax . At last he could sit up . And with returning warmth and sanity , he felt a sort of triumph . Now there would be no more faltering . He had stopped close to a sewer . He got out . No passers-by . The Lonely Hearts card came first ; he tore it three times and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handkerchief was next . The ring . . . To Charlotte from John , with ' love . . . He dropped it into the sewer . What else ? There remained only the pawn ticket . He hesitated , replaced it in his pocket . . . When he turned into the alley behind the Garden . he could hear laughter , excited voices , a steady hum of happiness . He lit a cigarette and entered .  | Had anyone noticed his absence ? How long had he been gone ? " You got away with it , did n't you , boss ? " Carl turned slowly . Amos Biddle grinned at him . " If I was running this circus , " said the cameraman , " I 'd sneak out for some air , too . " Remember , you 're still editor . Be one ! " You 'll get plenty of air if you do n't hop on it . How much did you get ? " " Everything . Even a shot of that old guy from Frisco when he passed out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Change it to love . Build him up a hermit . Never thought he 'd get a mate .

" " Yes . Lance still here ? " " You bet . You got to give Julie credit . " Carl pushed his way through to the center of the dance floor . From the platform he flagged for attention and announced one of the features of the evening , the Virginia Reel . He called the changes . " Do-see-do , down the middle and back again . " Is my voice trembling ? " Swing your partner around to the right . " Why did you leave me , John ? " Swing your partner around to the right . Down the middle and back again . Swing your partner around to the right .

Soon a halfdozen reels , more energetic than polished , were in progress in different parts of the Garden . Did I wipe the blood off the foot of the bed ? Stop trembling . Raise your voice . Louder . That 's too loud , too hysterical . Lower it . That 's better . The Virginia Reel completed , he raised his hands ; the drummer rolled for silence . Carl introduced the blushing Walther Zcekely and Ilona Mathusek , and announced the surprise engagement of the happy couple who had met at the Wisconsin booth . " Strangers yesterday , " he stressed dramatically . " Lovers tonight . " Amos Biddle winked and Lance McCleary yawned , but Julie Allison listened wide-eyed and thrilled to Carl 's inspiring words as he addressed the eager faces turned up to him  --  their champion .

Their ovation was dramatic and thunderous . And Carl Chapman was sick and cold . His ears rang and the lights blinded him and the flapping hands applauding him made him feel faint . Then his curbing mind came to his support and things began to take shape again . He tingled , remembering , as he bowed gratefully . For John Grant was dead , buried now forever .  | Four It was early morning . The garden was cool and quiet . He ached with weariness , his eyes dragged with it . But these were his moments alone in the garden he had created and he would not give them up . Here was peace , here was sanctuary . Here he was himself . Here that other feverish world did not exist . Here was where he belonged . On his knees before a bush , he worked humus into the loam around the roots with scrupulous thoroughness . No part of his task bored him . He loved it . The Chapman cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She arched her back and rubbed against him , kneading rhythmic paws into the humus bag . He pushed her away gently with the back of his hand . There was a patch of grass newly dried by the sun . She dropped to her back and rolled in it ecstatically , nipping at stray leaves . He caught himself wishing he could do that too . Behind him was the white-frame house . He knew every inch of it . Its blue shutters . . . How Rose had laughed at him when he insisted on them . " Carl Chapman  --  old-fashioned ! " Sheepishly he had tried to ex-  | plain that to him they meant being able to shut out the rest of the world ; and she had laughed again , indulgently , and kissed him . They were never closed , but looking at them he felt an inarticulate deep content . Even in his youth he had never dreamed of turreted castles on river bluffs , or longed to own a luxurious houseboat . This was what he wanted , this was what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth  --  and all heaven was snug within it . This was happiness . He moved to the next bush , measured humus expertly . It had all been raw earth . But he had dug deep , planting , spading , raking . Things grew for him . He had the " green hands . " He scooped up a handful of earth , crushed it , let it trickle through his fingers and felt the essence of his importance . With these hands he made things grow out of the earth . With these hands you killed . He recoiled . His breath sucked in and he was weak . He tried to rise and flee from horror but he could not . In his ears there was the roaring of a passing elevated train . He saw a man striking a woman , saw her fall , saw the look of triumph and relief on the man 's face . I have killed . He had felt no remorse . He was not sorry she was dead . He was glad ! He rocked back and forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved . He was pinned to the earth , defenseless , gasping and blind . He had killed  | and this was his punishment . Some mercy had kept judgment from him until now . But now he knew . He was guilty and every day punishment would return . All the rest of his life he would carry it with him ... He straightened . He held up his hands and studied them dully . . . He saw the humus bag again and the bush and the garden he had created . He turned and looked at his home and his garden . Peace and contentment . . . It was all strange to him . This too , then , was part of his punishment . . . Cold hatred grew in him . She would like to see him punished . But he would not be . He took a step forward . I will not let this happen ! Guilty ? No  --  my will shall blot that out . Punishment ? No  --  my will shall sweep that away . I can do it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch me  --  nothing ! From an open window came Rose 's laugh . The children were getting up . He could hear their highpitched chatter . As on every morning , Tommy was the first to come dashing out of the house . He stopped within a few feet of his father , clasped his hands behind his back and came forward , stiff-legged . " Good morning , Mr. Whiffenpoof , " he piped . Carl looked down at him without a smile . This too was part of the ritual . My son . . . Rose 's eyes but my mouth and chin . " Good morning , Mr. Kaflopsky , I see you have new overalls . " " On account of I 'm a working man . I want two pounds of oranges , please . "  | Carl pretended to survey a crowded market . " Sorry , I 'm fresh out of oranges . How about two nice bunches of radishes ? " Tommy giggled . " I ca n't buy them . My mother wo n't allow me . " He found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself on his father . His daughter Edith flew down the path shrieking , " Me too ! Me too ! " She was as light as a bird , the picture of Rose but with his own quick temper , his own greed for life . He hugged her convulsively . I 'll give you everything ? everything . . . The children drew away and stood side by side looking up at him with sly shining eyes . " There 's a package in the hall , " said Tommy . " There is ? " Edith quivered with excitement . " Is it for you , Daddy ? " " No " " For Mommy ? " " Not this time . " They were both dancing up and down , loving the suspense . " For the house ? " " No . " " For us ? " they screamed together . Carl nodded . They rushed off into the house and returned carrying the package between them . Their impatient fingers were ineffectual and fumbling . He helped them with the wrappings . They stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the engine . " It 's red ! " she babbled . " Look , Tommy , it 's red ! "  | But Tommy 's eyes were on the ground . His lower lip was out and he had paled . What was wrong ? Yesterday Rose had said something about a fever . Carl put his hand to the child 's forehead . " What 's the matter ? " Tommy shook his head and pointed to the engine . Then he was n't feeling ill . Carl squatted so he could look directly into his son 's eyes and held out his hands . In immediate imitation , Edith squatted beside him peering up at her brother . " What is it , son ? You know you can tell me . . . " " You said Sannaclaus was bringin ' me a train for Christmas . " " Yes ? " " You brought it . He 'll be mad . He wo n't bring me nothin ' !

He 's bringing you something else . " Tommy 's nose was less than two inches from his own . " What ? " Carl rose . " Oh , no you do n't ! Not until Christmas . " He watched them fall on the train , become instantly absorbed in its details . " Carl Chapman , you 're spoiling those children . " Rose had come up behind him , trying to look severe . He fitted her into the circle of his arm . Now it was complete . He felt his love grow into the earth , stretch into  | the sky . It made a wall around them through which only he had the secret of entrance . The three were looking at him , laughing . He knew the fierce joy of their dependence on him . This , all this , was his : always  --  forever .  | Five Lance McCleary reached for a ham sandwich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page as if he hated to admit it fully into his sight . 12,000 MADE HAPPY AT COMET LONELY HEARTS BALL Wisconsin Couple To Wed " Tchah ! " he said . The fat police sergeant leaned over and picked up the paper , his stomach bulging over his belt with relief from the restraint of brass buttons . He read the headline . " Now that 's a damned good story . " Lance yawned . " You 're a sentimentalist , Sarge . " He brooded over his sandwich and cup of warm coffee . " A circulation stunt and you fall for it at your age . " Three cops were writing reports at the table in the muster room ; in a corner one was having his shoes shined ; two were studying the bulletin board ; a duo were struggling through poker . They all grinned . The sergeant reddened around the ears . " You got  | the wrong attitude , Lance . You 're cynical . " He seemed proud of that one . He read the account of the ball . He sighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Du n no . " " It hits home . " " Ugh ! " " Well , it 's your paper . " " And it 's the bunk . " The opening door let in the angry yell of a small ' boy being hauled in by a solicitous officer . " I ai n't lost ! " roared the boy . " I 'm runnin ' away ! " He made a lunge for the door , was recaptured . " He wo n't tell me his name , " said the officer holding him . " An ' I ai n't gon na tell you where I live neither ! " Sergeant Pike did n't look up from the Lonely Hearts story . " I know him , " he said casually . " Met his ma a short while ago . Said she did n't want to see him again . " " That 's right , " said Lance indifferently . " I just left his father . He said he 's glad his son ran away . " Anxious brown eyes went from face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none . The boy opened his mouth and howled ; a flood of tears rolled down his cheeks . Blubbering incoherently that he wanted to go home , he was led out of the room . The triple-chinned sergeant looked at Lance as if he expected something . He said : " I remember the day when you went for a kid story like that . Used to call it human interest . " Lance disposed his length more comfortably on  | three chairs and took another bite of his sandwich . " Them days is gone forever , " he sang through it . " They sure is  --  are  --  You 've changed , Lance . " " Yeah , " put in the cop at the stand , " if the place is n't swimming in blood and there are n't more than ninety-three suspects , it 's no story to Charlie Chan there . " One of the men at the table , paring his nails with a Boy Scout knife , grinned . " Do n't you know ? " he said . " He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a sour face , but he was pleased . Only twenty-eight and criminologist-reporter . . . a far cry from that fresh kid with his first stiff police card , yellow and shiny and autographed by the Commissioner himself . He saw that lanky , clearskinned cub as though it were n't himself : a kid who could leap on a riot truck as it rolled to an emergency and sit up all night writing and rewriting the special feature that was lost in page nineteen ; who could spend eight hours in the rain with the sea-cops running down a junky smuggling alcohol and dope near Execution Light ; who was thrilled when veteran newspapermen first called him Lance . He slid lower on his spine and scratched his shoulder blades lazily against the back of the chair . He recalled every word in the Time article . " The thrill of the hunt is all that matters to tapered bloodhound Lance ( Comet ) McCleary who solved the grisly Leonard murder mystery ( Time , Aug. 12 , p. 31 ) . His psychic deductions ( i.e. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which confused  | police . Now he ( upped to criminologist-reporter ) lies in wait for more baffling murder knots to untie . Newshawks envy his uncanny ability of carrying a fistful of clues in one hand , an impatient typewriter in the other ( also his wages ) . " He smiled fondly at Sergeant Pike ; the lovable bulk in blue had seen the kid that was Lance fervently poring over the mysteries of the police blotter and out of the kindness of his heart had made them intelligible to him . Lance carefully stripped a piece of fat from the ham and flipped it into a wastebasket . He loved all mankind . Then his eye fell on the Comet and he frowned . Of all papers ! But there were compensations . One was Carl Chapman . He remembered , warmly , how Carl had hammered at him , ripped into his copy before the staff , taught him when to soften his satire , sharpen his adjectives , quicken his pace and sparkle more inventively , humorously and humanely . He loved Carl . He respected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't working for the Comet . He was working for Carl Chapman . Then there were other compensations  --  one hundred and five of them on a check every week . And a free hand with his crime stories . He felt very virtuous this bright and sunny morning in the muster room barred to the public eye , where a small fraction of New York 's finest let their hair down , cracked off-color jokes , gossiped and roughhoused . He had nothing to do but wait around  | until a big story broke . Easy pickings , this special feature stint . If Carl needed him , he knew where to reach him . He was sipping his cold coffee , trying to imagine it had just been made , when the door creaked and opened slightly . " Are you decent ? " Lance recognized the voice ; he watched its effect on the cops . Sore feet moved quickly as the arm of the law sprang into action . They climbed into harness , forgot poker , shined shields . Sergeant Pike fastened his belt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Without turning , Lance could picture her  --  as big as a minute , her blank hair curling up around the funny little hat she wore pulled down over one shining blue eye , with a figure that rightfully belonged behind footlights and not behind a daily excerpt from the Bible . In three years she had come a long way . She was now , if you please , Religious Editor of the Comet . He chuckled . What a job . And on the Comet . Incredible . Abruptly , the sandwich was plucked out of his hand . He turned and stared up at her . " Mr. McCleary ! " Her chin elevated slightly . " Meat ? on Friday ! " " Th ' haythin , " muttered a cop sympathetically . It amused Lance to pretend to be sorry , so he said it to please her . " I 'm sorry , honey , I forgot . " She was wearing a black and white suit . " Golly , you look cute , " he added . She put her hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgiving him , wrinkling her short eager nose . " Mr. McCleary , that was a beautiful story . " Before he could stop her , she turned to the cops . " Did you read the Lonely Hearts story he wrote ? " " Who wrote ? " boomed Sergeant Pike , his eyes dancing . " She 's feverish , " said Lance lightly . " Come on , Julie , I want to talk to you outside . " " Wait a minute , " said the sergeant . " I want to congratulate you , Mr. Heart-of-Gold . " Julie 's eyes widened . " Mr. McCleary tries so to be hard-boiled , but anyone could tell he wrote it even if he did n't want his by-line on it . " Lance looked at the cops and threw out his hands . " All right . All right . So I wrote it . " " You do n't have to be modest , Mr. McCleary , " said Julie . " It 's the most wonderful ? " Lance laughed . For three years he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lance , yet she persisted in this ridiculous formality for no reason he could discover . " What are you thinking about ? " " Oh , maybe about your funny Irish nose , " he said . She smiled . What a girl  --  perfect ! Some lucky guy will get her . But she wanted him . Ali , no , Julie ; I 've seen what happened to reporters when they get married . . . kids , bills , diapers , bills , crazy hours , bills , crazy assignments . . . And anyway who wants to get mar-ried  --  yet ?  | " What brought you here ? " he asked . " Oh , I just dropped in to see the boys . " " You 've seen them ! Now come on , what 's it all about ? " " Mr. McCleary " ? she began with apprehension , finished determinedly ? " I 've come to ask you to do me a favor . " He was a chip from a tough , knotty Irish oak block . He could only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endanger his freedom , or encroach on his sense of humor . Now he lost it . " What ? " he yelled . " Again ? " She lowered dark lashes . He changed his tone . " What is it ? " " Mabel 's shower , " she said softly . Even the cops were stunned . " She 's getting married next Sunday and we girls are all bringing our boy friend ? " " Julie  --  for Pete 's sake ! " But she went on " ? and you 've got to bring a present too ! " Lance glared . Then he realized all this was ridiculous . All he had to say was no . " Some other time , Julie . " But she just stood there looking up at him without a word . Starting early in the morning , was she ? Smart girl . No matter what kind of a fence he threw up around himself , he knew she 'd work her way through it by the end of the day . He had to get out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Got to beat it , Julie , " he said as if he just remembered he left his apartment in flames . " Got to run  | down a lead . Got to hurry . See you some more ! " Slie stepped in his way . " And Mabel 's shower ? " " Oh  --  that ! " He was careless , light , manufacturing a . shrug . " We 'll talk about it later . " " " That 's what they 're doing , " said a new voice . Talking . " Amos Biddle , camera slung over back , shuffled into the muster room . Ile smacked his lips over a bulging candy . " Your ar-jerker on Lonely Hearts made the rounds , ance , " he drawled . " The boys on Park Row are taring down Civic Virtue . They 're putting up a tatue of you instead , with a broken heart in one hand nd a roll of adhesive tape in the other . " The cops roared . Julie did n't think it was so funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way out of her clutches . " What are you doing here , Amos ? " he asked amiably . The cameraman was puzzled . He had expected an explosion . " I live down the block , " he explained , still wary . " Had a hunch you 'd be here . " He shifted Ilic candy . " Just dropped in to pat you on the back for the best slush I could n't wade through . " " What 's the box for ? " " Nothing that would interest you . The desk knew I had a Graflex home and as long as she was killed around here I could grab a coupla shots of her for ? " " Killed ? Who was killed ? " " Forget it , Philo Vance . This dame is no news . " " You just said she was killed . " " Yup . '  | " And with that lead you call it no news ? " " No name .

" " Or walk with Kings  --  nor lose the common touch . ' Kipling , " said Sergeant Pike solemnly . As one , they turned and gazed at him , awed . " Just bought the poem for my boy , " he muttered uncomfortably . Lance picked up where he had left off . " Listen , Roly-Poly , I 'll show you how to take a lead and make it sensational . " Amos laughed . " You think you can ring the bell just because she was killed and you got an imagination . " " What you got says I ca n't ? " " Five bucks says you ca n't . " " It 's a bet . Get that boys ? Witnesses . Do n't let this guy crawl out when I win . " " But Mr. McCleary , " broke in Julie , " how about ? " Lance dragged Amos to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's where I make me five bucks ! " The door slammed . Sergeant Pike sat down in his chair and leaned back . " Great guy , Lance , " he said fondly . Suddenly his face dropped . " Woman killed ? " He leaped to his feet . " Hey , Lance ! " he cried , lumbering to the door and wrenching it open . " Hey ? who was killed ? When ? Where ? How ? Hey ! "  | Six The morgue hearse parked in front of a tenement as the first thing Lance saw as he swung around the rner , the puffing Amos behind him . A cop shooing Curious kids away greeted him . " What are you doing here , Lance ? Going to solve a mystery ? " Lance grinned . " First I got to collect five bucks , Eddie . " The cop shrugged . All reporters were crazy . Amos pushed forward , a tank , making a hole through the people massing the entrance ; Lance kept right behind him . The hallway was jammed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brat , a rat-faced man staring , a sleepy streetwalker . . . And water on the stairs . . . Amos climbed , breaking trail up the stairway . Lance followed him . The babble followed Lance : " Who killed her ? . . . She was stabbed . . . No , shot ! I heard it . . . You heard nothin ' , Joe . . . Awshuttup ! . . . Who is it ? . . . I just seen her yesItchy . . . She was lookin ' for a job . . . Choked ! Somebody choked her . . . '  | The janitor 's scrawny wife was sulkily mopping the wet floor in front of an open doorway . A cop blocked the path . Lance knew him . " H'lo , Paddy . " The cop blinked . " We 'll have to get the D.A . over now that Joe Hawkshaw 's here . " He jerked his head toward the room . " One of your girl friends , Lance ? " " Blonde ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to Amos . " If you got it in one bill it 'll be easier for you to count . " He entered the room . The cop had to move for Amos . Lance 's first impression was a hunch  --  the janitor , on his knees in a corner of the squalid one-room apartment , soaking up water from the floor with dirty rags and wringing them out into a pail . Lance did n't like it ; he did n't like to walk into a story and see a janitor messing around . He shrugged . He had no time for hunches . This was just a casual drop-in , look-see and the collection of five dollars from an unimaginative cameraman . There was no reason for the vague uneasiness the janitor 's grumbling gave him : " Water upstairs , downstairs , three hun'red sixty-four nights th ' guy downstairs stays home . This one night he 's got ta be out cattin ' . " In the corner an assistant medical examiner was bent over a corpse on the bed . Lance remembered him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the type who always reads columns for the jokes he can memorize .  | Dr. Kuppenheimer looked up . " Oh , McCleary . Slumming ? " Then he forgot Lance and continued his examination . Lance nodded to the cop on duty and to the police photographer , who was setting up his camera . He leaned over the iron railing of the bed casually . " Fix the time , Doc ? " he asked . " If it 'll help you get a raise  --  sometime last night . " " Hm . " Lance rubbed his chin thoughtfully . The examiner glanced up , shook his head quizzically , and went back to the cadaver , his fingers swift , sure . " Married ? " asked Lance . " Umph . " " Who killed her ? " " Umph . " " D' ya mind , buddy ? " The janitor , on his knees , looked up impatiently , banging the pail against Lance 's leg . " I wan na get over here . " Lance moved away . Funny , water all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Ai n't got ' nuff work . . . damn dames got ta leave their water runnin ' . . . Lance lit a cigarette . Investigation going on and they permitted a janitor in the room . There was a laxity present he did n't relish . " I 'm all set , Dr. Kuppenheimer , " said the police photographer . The man from the morgue motioned to the cop . Together they lifted the body and laid it on a sheet tap cad on the damp floor . Close-ups of the bruise on the head ; repeated shots of front , back and profiles.  | Lance was bored . Routine stuff . A stooge from the morgue , a cop who should be back at his school-crossing corner and a police photographer who could n't make the grade with that news service outfit . Finished , the photographer turned to Amos in the doorway . " What are you doing here , Biddle ? " Amos grunted . That was the second thing Lance did n't like . Amos was looking at him too lamblike . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing some of that fat at the thought of parting with five dollars . As Dr. Kuppenheimer knelt to make a closer examination of the head , Lance 's eyes swept the room . Underwear and stockings hanging across a cord from corner to corner attracted his attention . " She must have got it after she washed her clothes , " he announced as if he had stumbled on an important revelation . He circled the room slowly , eyes narrowed , chin out a la Sherlock Holmes , until his face unexpectedly ran into the cop 's on duty . " I read Time too , " said the cop unemotionally . Lance ignored him . He , too , knelt . " Bullet ? " Dr. Kuppenheimer shrugged . Lance bent closer to get a better look . " Death blow , eh , Doc ? " Dr. Kuppenheimer ran his fingers over the left leg of the corpse . He moved around the body . Lance was in his way . " Maybe you want to make the report , Lance ? " Lance grinned , drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kuppenheimer kept on with his  | work . Lance bit his lip . He did n't like him , either . He came close to the body again , walking on his knees , undaunted . " Lead pipe ? " Dr. Kuppenheimer looked thoughtful . " Lead ? Maybe . . . . It 's in the bathroom . " That was more like it ! Lance sprang up and went to the bathroom , eagle-eyed . " Look out ! " He stopped cold . The cop walked up to him . " You almost stepped on the soap , " he said solicitously . Always kidding around , these bulls . Lance stepped over the soap . A moment later he hurried out . " Hey , Doc ! I ca n't find it . " " Find what ? " " The  --  whatever she was struck with . " Dr. Kuppenheimer sat back on his heels . " Lance , are you drunk ? " Lance exploded . " Listen , Doc , I 'm not here to play straight man . I 'm in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examiner pursed his lips , waved his hand wearily , and turning to the cop , began , " Corpse marked ? " The cop laboriously took down the dictated report in his notebook . Lance gave up . He went over to the window and stared down at the kids hovering around the morgue wagon . Now he 'd have to wait until that pompous butcher had finished rattling off . " ? tentative diagnosis , " the examiner was continuing monotonously . " Impression is possible fracture of base of skull or subarachnoid hemorrhage ? "  | Lance lost his patience . " For the love of Mike , " he broke in , " let 's get started on this ! " He turned to the cop still struggling with the report . " Where 's Peacock ? Where 's MacNamara ? How come the Homicide Squad is n't here yet ? Maybe the Commissioner is afraid to disturb his Rover Boys ? " " I do n't get you , Lance , " mumbled the cop , moistening his pencil . " Who 's on the hunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the guy who killed her ? He may be halfway to Texas by now ! Why do n't you ? " " Guy who killed who ? " asked the cop . " This woman ! " shouted Lance . " Who murdered her ? " The cop laughed . Dr. Kuppenheimer laughed . The police photographer laughed . Even the janitor laughed . " What in hell is so funny ? " demanded Lance . A pudgy palm came down in front of his eyes , outstretched , waiting . " She was taking a bath . " Amos Biddle 's voice was nice and low . " She slipped on the soap . She fell . She struck her head . She was killed . Five dollars . Please . Thank you . " Lance groaned . He reached for his wallet slowly . A twenty-mule team held it back . He finally brought it out . Eighteen intricate locks bolted it . He got it open . Amos said , still in the same tone , " The desk told me to get pictures . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He pointed to a bill with a stubby finger . " That one . It 's a fiver . One bill . Easy to count . Thank you . "  | He plucked it neatly from the wallet , examined it solemnly on both sides and held it up to the light . Lance eyed him with disgust . " Three hundred pounds of deceit , " he said bitterly . Amos smirked . You asked for it , Lance told himself ; he warned you ; you just walked right into it . And now you 're walking out . And then Amos laughed . Lance stopped . Wait a minute . . . You did n't say you 'd get a murder out of this . The bet was to make the story sensational . That 's it ! He felt more confident . He 'd get his money back and five to boot when the Comet splashed his story across the front page . What story ? Tenement woman takes bath , slips , falls , cracks head against faucet and dies . So what ? Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , McCleary , you can make a yarn out of this . It 's a cinch . If you can break news , you can make it . Is n't that what Carl always says ? He watched Amos take pictures for the Comet Safety Week campaign ; pictures of the soap on the floor , the tub , the body . " What 's her name ? " he asked . " Du n no , Lance , " said the cop . " Smith when she took this place . Neighbor down the hall knew her as Jones . " Unidentified corpse . Plenty of heart . He 'd get punch into this . . . . Cheap joint . Look at the kitchenette . No food . And her shoes  --  He picked one up . Hm  --  fancy for a tenement dame . Maybe she was a taxi-dancer ? Nah , too old . But how about those Times  | Square dolls ? Nope , no good . No heart in a taxidancer . But a middle-aged one ! Show me a guy who 'll hire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dance . She came in tired and kicked her shoes off . So ? Amos ' voice reached him . " How you doing , Lance ? " I 'll show him ! The thing to do is figure it out logically and change everything . She 's alone in the world . Nobody knows where she came from , who she is . If only she was a movie star ! Maybe that 's an angle ? nope , no good . An heiress  --  a runaway heiress ! Her ? All right , so she 's not an heiress . She 's  --  oh , what the hell ! McCleary , you 're slipping . Think , you dope . Now wait , now wait . Let 's see . . . She 's all alone and ? Why alone ? She 's my cousin . From the West . Came out here to look for me . I can get away with anything because she 's my cousin . . . . That stinks . Carl knows I got no relatives . Dr. Kuppenheimer 's raised voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they always send me out on these damned accidents ! They die from heat exposure , freeze to death , struck by lightning . I 'm sent out ! Baby burned by stove , man falls downstairs , boy shoots self with gun , woman slips in tub . I 'm sent out ! Accidents  --  accidents-accidents ! " Lance went back to his thoughts . Accident . Come in with an accident buried in adjectives and they 'd bury him . He went into the bathroom . Why ? What are you  | looking for ? There 's her washcloth  --  talc  --  towelrobe  --  nightgown . You 're stalling , McCleary ; you 're stuck and you know it and you 're stalling . That was n't you Time wrote about . That was a lucky stiff who had a corpse thrown right at him , story , clues  --  the works . You 're a fourflusher . You had a couple lucky breaks and you been coasting on them since . Lance came out of the bathroom as Dr. Kuppenheimer stalked from the room and the hearse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Amos slung the camera across his shoulder and watched Lance with amusement . " Come on , sucker , you 're licked . " Lance swallowed hard . You going to let him get away with that ? Get an angle . Just one lousy little miserable angle . You can blow it up . . . An angle on an accident ! You used to cover them . No story then . No story now . Never a story . Just a paragraph hiding behind the ads . McCleary , go back and run copy ! " Stop grinning like an ape ! " he snapped at Amos . " I 'm thinking . " What a threat . You 're thinking ! He began one last hopeless round of the room , with the door waiting inevitably . Nothing . . . nothing . . . nothing . . . He passed the dress hanging on the closet door . Her only dress . Poor dame . . . you were almost a story . . . He joined the waiting Amos , stopped . " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking himself the same thing . Why had he stopped ? Something . . . He turned and went  | back slowly . What was it ? The dress ? . . . The dress . . . Oh , yes , the bit of red string stuck to the shoulder . McCleary , you 're nuts ! A piece of red string ! He picked it off  --  it stuck to the dress . That 's funny . He examined it more closely . Suddenly he felt that same good old tingling . McCleary , you 're going to ring the bell ! He ran his hand down inside the dress . He found the safety pin , unfastened it ; the red string dropped into his hand . He rushed out of the room , past Amos . Then he halted . Back he went to the goggle-eyed cameraman . " Give me that five bucks ! " Forty-five minutes later he sauntered up to the city desk . " Where 've you been ? " asked Carl . " They found a torso of a girl . About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Drive . . . We 'll blame it on the Gorilla Man . I like him . He sells papers . " Lance asked , " You know that woman who was killed in a bathtub last night ? " Carl took a moment to okay the proof on his desk . " What are you talking about ? " " Carl  --  look . " Lance thumbed through a copy of the Comet to page thirty-three , circled a stick with a pencil . " That yarn . " Carl glanced at it , returned to the proof . " What about it ? " " I know who she was . "  | Carl kept his eyes down . Oh , God , I knew it , he thought ; I knew the moment he walked in and turned to that stick .. . He continued to play with the proof . He changed a ten-point bold head to eight-point bold caps . Damn that Monroe ; fifteen years of story mangling at the slot and still an independent bastard . A boy passed , dropped copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the abortion story ; he changed the lead and rememberd an angle to raise it out of the mediocre to page one interest . And all the time he was frozen , crouching over the desk . He could n't keep this up indefinitely . Lance was waiting . Soon he must speak  --  but he was afraid to hear his own voice ; it would betray him . The copy . . . " Prindle . " The rewrite man left his typewriter and came up to the desk . " This doctor was in a bank holdup under an alias in August , 1923 . Dig out the files and check . " That was good ; his judgment and memory were as flawless as ever . Now he could look at Lance . He formed the words carefully . " Who , Lance ? "  | " She was ? " No , no ; not yet . Hold him off . . . . He droned , " Copy boy . " A boy flashed to the desk . " Tell Monroe to go over this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Charles Eastman . " He handed the boy the copy and heard him say yes , sir , and watched him bring it over to Monroe at the copy desk . I know who she was . Why had Lance stopped there ? Why had n't he gone on ? Is he feeling me out ? How much does he know ? He picked up the phone . " Get me Yerkes . " He spiked a story with his free hand ; his palm was cold with sweat , but the fingers did n't tremble , the hand was steady . " Now what 's this all about ? " he said to Lance . " I want you to hop on that rape . " He was holding the phone so hard against his ear that the voice at the other end of the line hurt him . It was a laconic , " Yeah , boss . " " Yerkes , McCleary 's on that rape . You stick close to the girl 's father . Go home with him . I want all the art I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , Lance ? Shoot . " Lance grinned . " This is going to knock you right out of your chair , Carl . " He 's smiling . . . . What must I say ? " Okay , Lance , knock me right out of my chair . Who was she ? " " A Lonely Heart . " Carl waited . But that was it ? " A Lonely Heart . . . " Hysteria began to well up in him . He knew if he opened his mouth he would laugh , he would yell with laughter . He dropped his pencil . It rolled and  | fell to the floor . And when he had picked it up , he was himself again . " How do you know ? " he said . He watched Lance fumble through his pocket , drop something on the desk . It was a piece of red string , not more than half an inch . Lance looked smugly pleased with himself . It irritated Carl . " What am I supposed to do , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What is it ? " Lance leaned forward . " It wo n't be a puzzle to you when you recognize it . " What does he mean by that ? Lance tapped the end of the string with his finger . " See that ? " The string was fastened to a tiny metal heart , a fragment of red pasteboard still attached to it . Where did he get it ? Did he find it in the room ? " What about it ? " Lance pulled out a Lonely Hearts Club card . " Remember this ? Look : same string , same little metal heart , same color red cardboard , same ? " " I see it , I see it . But you ca n't be sure . " Lance held up a small safety pin . " It was pinned to her dress  --  this was inside  --  right over her heart . " To her dress ? I did n't have time . I had to get out of there . I would have gone crazy . That 's why I missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first place ? What 's the idea taking such a long time to get to the point ? " Lance spread his hands . " A long time ? I 'm just telling it to you . " " Well , you 've got something . " Carl leaned back in his swivel chair and rocked . " When did you see her ? " " About an hour ago . "  | " What were you doing on a bathtub accident ? " Lance told him briefly . Carl smiled . " Get the fivespot from Biddle ? " " Do you have to ask ? Tonight I 'll get the other one . " Carl nodded . He had but to say , " Forget it , " and the story would be forgotten . What shall I do ? But he knew the question was ridiculous . He had no choice . He was an editor . He could have only one impulse , " Print it . " Then he felt it . That familiar warmth that always met an irresistible challenge . Boomerang or beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He looked at Lance fondly . " You 're okay . " Lance smirked . He never walked away from praise . " You smell a yarn so well you 're beginning to smell yourself . " The smirk faded . " Hey , wait a minute ! " " So you found a Lonely Heart . Now is n't that a shortcut to a one-day break . , the better . " Lance took refuge in sarcasm . " What 're you going to do  --  steal her ? " " No , bury her . " It took a moment for that to sink in . Then Lance shook his head admiringly . " You son-of-a-gun . . . . The publisher of the Cornet , Frank Madison , who had made a name for himself in the newspaper world as a New Deal hobgoblin when he mixed with both  | political parties , was an iron-gray , chipmunk-cheeked little ball of fat .

" It 'll sell papers ! " The publisher rose and walked about the room with short bouncing steps ; he adjusted a blind , straightened a picture . " I do n't know , " he said worriedly , " sometimes , Chapman , you go beyond . . . It 's difficult to explain . . . Such a distasteful approach . . . " " It 'll sell papers .

I 'm going to bury her . It came to him shockingly : This is Charlotte ! I 'm using Charlotte as a springboard for circulation . . . .  | The art editor was waiting for him for an okay on the love-nest layout . Johnson of the composing room had a suggestion for the sixty-point head that had given him trouble . A narcotic haul had just been reported by the police . The Sugar King 's wire threatened libel unless a retraction was printed to that story . The ferryboat Robert Fulton had smashed a barge ; and the St. Francis Hospital was ablaze Picture ! " Boy !

" There she was surrounded by a dozen men and women in front of the Massachusetts booth . Too late to destroy it now . . . . Lance came around to his side , leaned on the desk to squint at the picture intently . " There 's her card . Funny I could n't find the damn thing anywhere . " She had n't used her right name . She told him that . Who would recognize this gaunt tubercular woman ? Who would remember her as Charlotte ? " Start pounding out that burial , " he ordered . " Old man squawk ? " " At first . " " Save one soul and we double our advertising rates ; that turned the trick , huh ? " " There 'll be a funeral , too . "  | " Broadway ? " " Fifth Avenue . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your picture , Lance . From Potter 's Field to Woodlawn Cemetery in one jump . " Lance grinned . " By courtesy of the Comet  --  the paper that buries its dead ! "  | Eight " What in hell am I doing here ? " Sometimes Lance puzzled himself . Right now I ought to be at Police Headquarters , he thought . Maybe something 's come up . Maybe it 's a delivery boy and he 's confessing right now . Just my luck they 've picked up an escaped lunatic and he 's the Gorilla ! And I 'm here . . . in the Morgue . Maybe it 's a butcher . Nah , bet it 's one of those strong-arm guys from a circus . I could be fired for not sticking on that story . But he shrugged and went down the hallway . He had learned not to question his own hunches . He stopped at an open doorway and said mildly , " Boo . " Small , hazel-eyed Nell Mitchell , who sewed up corpses after the autopsies were completed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Come on in . Long time no see . " He patted her head . " How 's Needle Nellie ? Heard you 're using an electric gadget for that cat-gut . " " You heard right . We 're streamlined now . Say , is  | this on the level ? " She held up the front page of the Comet . " Your Lonely Hearts Club really going to bury her ? " " Yep . " Carl had spared no space . Page one was all Lonely Heart . A deep four-column photo layout had the picture of the group surrounding her in front of the booth . A two-column inset was a closeup of the bathtub victim . Nellie looked at the pictures with renewed interest . " Lance , did they really all wear hearts at that shindig ? " " It was just a  --  Nellie , you 're wonderful . " Her eyes widened . " Am I ?

" " And make a hole in the dress ? You 're crazy . " " But if you were burned up about something ? " She reflected . " Even if I had a fight with my boy friend I would n't get mad enough to do that . " " Okay . Thanks , Nellie . " " For what ? " He pinched her cheek . " For being wonderful . " She slapped his hand away . " What are you doing around here anyway , when half the noseybodies in New York are looking for the Gorilla ? " " I 'm playing hookey . " He went down the corridor . " Hey , Lance ! " He opened a door and poked his head in . The  | woman behind the drawing board peered at him over horn-rimmed glasses . " I could recognize that farmer 's walk of yours twenty years from now . Were you going to pass by without dropping in to see me ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of white teeth . He had always liked her teeth . " Nellie told me your paper 's burying a Lonely Heart . Whose idea was it  --  yours or the newsboy 's ? " " The newsboy 's . What you got ? " He looked down over her shoulder . " Hmm  --  nice colors . " She touched a fine brush to the painting . " Stomach of a poison suicide . " She was the Rembrandt of the Morgue . " How 's yours ? " He laughed . " Flow 's the family ? " " Fine . Jessie 's going on eight and Mickey wants to be Tarzan 's son . " " Mickey ? He 's new , is n't he ? " " Three years new . When are you getting married ? " " ' Bye , Wilma , " he said firmly . She shouted after him . " Give my love to Julie ! " In the autopsy room an attendant was washing a slab with a hose . He said , " He 's back in his office . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER of the CITY OF NEW YORK . He entered without knocking . Dr. James Francis O'Hanlon popped up from his desk and came forward to shake Lance 's hand warmly . He was short , energetic and bald-headed . Now sixtysix , he had been in the M.E. 's office since 1918 , performed at least seventy-five hundred autopsies and  | gained recognition as one of the most erudite medical scientists in the United States . " Lance McCleary ! It 's great seeing you again . But you should have been with me yesterday . Three and two on DiMaggio with bases full . Man , what a sock ! Right over the shaving ad in right field . " Lance grinned . The doctor had n't changed . A stubby finger was waved under his nose . " Let me tell you these butter-fingered players today with those lively balls ca n't hold a candle to the old-timers ! " Selecting a cigar from his desk humidor , Dr. O'Hanlon gestured emphatically with it . " Joe 's a good slugger but did he ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would the Tigers have been without Ty Cobb ? That thief stole more bases in one season than the whole American League did in a year . " Lance got an inspiration . " How 'd you like an Annie Oakley for tomorrow 's game ? " The doctor almost swallowed his cigar . " That 's the deciding game of the World 's Series ! " " Where 'd you like to sit ? " " Any seat , any seat ! " " How about behind the screen ? " The Chief Medical Examiner 's eyes bulged . " Where I can see the curves break ? " " And watch the old equalizer ? " " ? and see how they behave when they have three and two on them ! " Dr. O'Hanlon puffed luxuriously . " An Annie Oakley to the last game of the Series . . . Lance , if there 's anything I can ever do ? "  | " You can  --  now . " " Name it .

" " Hmm , must be something big . What case ? " " Bathtub accident . " " Yes ? " " She slipped in a tub . " " Yes ? " Just slipped . " Dr. O'Hanlon gave him a puzzled look . " Who examined her ? " " Dr. Kuppenheimcr . " The examiner looked through the papers in the basket on his desk . " Here it is  --  subarachnoid hemorrhage . Very precise report . What do you want me to do ? " " Open her up . " Dr. O'Hanlon chewed the cigar , puffing very slowly as he reread the report . He said , " It 's a story you 're after , eh ? Lance , I want to show you something . " He beckoned . The reporter followed him into the " icebox " where three hundred separate compartments stored sixteen thousand corpses a year . The door of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story , " said the examiner , opening door 79 , " here 's an interesting one for you .  | Young Negress , unmarked , apparently peacefully dead  --  but there 's a deep stab wound in her heart that left an almost invisible scratch .

She was strangled . " " Nope . " " All right , all right ! You want the bathtub girl ? You 'll get the bathtub girl . What 's her name ? " " Unidentified . " " Lance , we 've had four this week . " " I can recognize her . " " All right , they 're over there . " He pointed to the compartments in the corner . " From two-seventy . " Lance opened 270 . A fat man on the slab .

" Just a waste of time , " he said , " but I 'll do it for you . " He tapped the ash from his cigar , selected a scalpel-sharp butcher knife and began at the head of Lonely Heart . " You know , Lance , the Baltimore Orioles were the toughest bunch of players that ever got together . " He sawed off the top of the skull and examined the brain . " Each one of ' em loved to scrap . That was when Johnnie McGraw played outfield for them . "  | He was about to make an incision at the base of the throat to cut straight down through the abdomen when Lance found his tongue . " Uh  --  uh  --  Doctor ? " Cigar jutting from the corner of his mouth , the examiner looked up . " Yes ? " " The Comet 's burying her . " " Indeed ? Why ? " " She was a member of the Comet Lonely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evening gown I suppose . You want all marks concealed . " He made an incision at the lower end of the breastbone . " Ball players they call ' em today ! Why , back in fourteen when the Braves battled the Athletics  --  that was the day of real ball players . You young fellows today miss plenty . That million dollar infield they had ! Stuffy McInnes on first " ? he branched the cut to extend to the armpits ? " Jack Barry as shortstop , Eddie Collins on second and Home-Run Baker on third . " Lance had seen many autopsies . But they always got him . He fought against being sick over the corpse . Dimly through the roaring in his ears he heard , " In the good old days they used to warm up two , even three pitchers before a game . If a twirler did n't have the stuff , another boy 'd be sent in to pitch . A catcher can always tell if a pitcher 's ready . But today  --  bah ! " The cut was completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a laugh . Why Walsh 's spitball and Christy 's fadeaway  --  they were something ! Christy Mathewson  --  what a man ! " Dr. O'Hanlon put the cigar down , gently corn-  | pressed her lungs and stomach and sniffed at her lips . Lance quickly averted his head . He knew the examiner was sniffing for the odor of bitter almonds , evidence of cyanide of potassium or hydrocyanic acid . Dr. O'Hanlon straightened , relit his cigar . No odor . He puffed with enjoyment as he opened the thoracic cage , removed the heart , weighed it . He cut the chambers open and looked at them , examining the coronary arteries . " And what about Big Train Johnson who smoked them over the plate for twenty-one delirious summers ? Where can you see ' em pitch like that today ? And Three-Fingered Brown 's hook and Carl Mays ' submarine and Grover Cleveland Alexander . " He cut out the lungs , weighed them , then pressed them with his fingers as if they were a blown-up balloon . " She did n't drown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This corpse was a corpse before it struck the water . " " Her head struck the faucet in the tub , " explained Lance . " That 's what killed her . See those bruises on the body ? She must have hit every part of the tub . " Lance was perspiring . Dr. O'Hanlon was removing the stomach . " About the only lad left today who can throw a real screwball is Carl Hubbell . . . The sinkers they throw these days are nothing but old-fashioned drops ! " He groped inside the cadaver , shook his head , mumbled , " Lost . . .  | Lance leaned forward , waiting tensely . Was something wrong ? Had Dr. O'Hanlon discovered a flaw ? A lead ? What was it ? " Lost , " repeated the examiner . " It 's a lost art today  --  stealing bases . " Lance stepped back , tried to take a deep breath , found he could n't . The room . It felt stuffy . He knew it was n't . Ventilation was excellent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut out the intestines carefully , went over them foot by foot . He examined her organs for any evidence of criminal attack or operation . " You understand I 'm not crabbing , Lance . Lots of good talent around these days . But nothing great . Nothing like Chief Bender the Indian and Eddie Plank and Rogers Hornsby . " Lance stared straight ahead , keeping his eyes from the red opening below , waiting , hoping , knowing this was , as he had been forewarned , a waste of time . " Tomorrow when I watch ' em cross the dish and powder homers , " said the examiner , taking the kidneys out , " I 'll be thinking of Frankie . " It took a full moment for Lance to piece the sentence together . " Frankie ? " Dr. O'Hanlon dropped the kidneys on the slab and turned the corpse over . " He 's that young fellow working in the back room , the museum , collecting hearts . He usually goes with me . " He cut through the vertebrae and exposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ split-second . The canal was filled with blood . Dr. O'Hanlon looked up , his eyes twinkling hope-  | fully . " Say , Lance , you do n't think you could  --  uhfix up another ducat for Frankie , do you ? Hmm ? " Lance staring at the wall could still see the red canal . " Sure , sure , " he said . " That 's great ! " The examiner turned the corpse over on its back again . " Only this morning I was telling Frankie about the game in twenty-five when I first heard a slugger squawk to the ump ? You ca n't hit ' em when you ca n't see ' em ! ' " He chuckled at the memory of that moment and gently proceeded to replace the vital organs . " First in war , first in peace and last in the American League  --  the Washington Senators ! " he announced dramatically , burst into laughter and as he replaced the heart , shook his head reminiscently . " Yes , sir , Lance , them were the days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the examiner 's time and his own . His hunch was wrong and he needed a drink . " Dr. Kuppenheimer 's diagnosis was right , Lance . Blood clot 's there from the faucet blow . Her spinal canal filled with blood is evidence of intracranial hemorrhage . That 's all there is to it . This corpse is n't worth a line except as a warning to be more cautious getting in and out of bathtubs . " " You 're sure there 's nothing else ? " The examiner looked at him queerly , then smiled . " What 's the matter with you , Lance ? You used to be able to recognize a story at a glance . I 'll get Nellie to sew this up now . Any kind of evening dress will do . No scars will show . " Lance knew he was going down for the last time .  | He tried once more . " Will you do me one last favor ? " " Now what ? " " Will you scrape her ? " " Lance , " Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ashamed of yourself , But an Annie Oakley 's an Annie Oakley ! You want her scraped ? She 'll be scraped . " He lifted the hands of the corpse and with a toothpick cleaned out what he found under the nails of the right hand , transferred it to a slide and slipped it under the microscope . Then he gave a soft whistle of surprise . Lance jumped . " What is it ? " The examiner scratched his chin . He was n't thinking baseball now . Something was up ! He stared at Lance incredulously . " How do you do it ? " Lance 's voice cracked . " How do I do what ? " " Take a look for yourself . " Lance bent over the microscope . Suddenly he felt that same good old tingling . " It looks like  --  it looks like ? " " It is . Those are scraps of flesh and bits of hair . "  | Nine He knows . . . Carl closed his eyes .

He had an odd sense that past and present were fused , so that he could not differentiate between what he himself had seen and known and what he had read and heard . . . The Five Points Mission to which , after his great anti-slavery speech at Cooper Union , Lincoln had strolled to investigate the poor in the lusty , impudent , vile vagabondry of that day . . . The Red Roach , one-time famous house of prostitution , now a bird and animal store : " Our Agents Are Busy in Far-off Africa , South America and India " . . . The Tub of Blood , now a flophouse . . . McGurk 's Suicide Hall , now a rescue mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had hung in the Rescue Mission . Sophie was gone and a lumber dealer whose stock was all under roof was there instead . . . A.C.B.

It was a hotel-equipment store now . There was Dickson 's ! One window was yesterday , still brazenly displaying likenesses of President Cleveland , John Drew and General Grant as specimens of the " Artistic Work Done Within " ; the other was  | today  --  it featured photographs for passports , sweethearts , cab drivers ' licenses . . . Across from it should be the Doyer Dump where he had gambled his earnings from the Chronicle . You went through the brown door and up two flights . . . The brown door was two doors and they were red and the place was a drygoods jobber 's now . Hamburgers one could reach out and touch sizzled invitingly . The stove had been moved to the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread and coffee with cream 10 ? " It used to be 40 . He had never had enough to eat in those days . He was almost tempted to buy and eat a hamburger for the hunger he had known then . But his stomach rebelled .

Had he actually seen Mr. Zero feeding the hungry in his Tub ? Had they been real  --  the street stabbings , that sailor robbed and beaten to death by a gang of hoodlums , the busking act that degenerated into a fatal tussle with " inside " entertainers , sending three dancers to Potter 's Field and six singers to Bellevue ? It seemed so long ago , so far away . . . But he was approaching the shop . He had not had time to get down until today . What could she have pawned ? He fingered the ticket in his pocket . He did n't have to look at it . He could sit down right now and set it up word for word , character for character , in the right caps and the same rules . He knew what was in italics and what was boldface . " Socks , mister ? Imported . T'ree pairs f ' twennyseven cents . " He would get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand the ticket across the counter to a clerk , ask " How much ? " pay him and walk out again . What could she have pawned ? What if he were asked , " What did you pawn ? " It saved time for the clerks . What did you pawn  --  a camera ? And to the camera-shelf . A coat ? To the  | clothes-rack . A suitcase ? To the baggage room . Jewelry ? To the safe . What could he say ? If he hesitated . . . She may have told them not to honor the ticket to anyone but herself . Or was n't that a law ? There had been a story . . . last June . He remembered giving it a head . An A.P . story . Oh , yes , a new law about pawn shops  --  only owners could get their stuff . But that was a midwest yarn . Not here . What could she have pawned ? A picture ? A locket ? I gave her a locket once for her birthday . Could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe she got two dollars on it  --  if she was lucky .

I could check . . . I could say it was my sister or a friend . . . This is senseless ! I 'm taking the whole thing too seriously . I ought to tear the ticket up and forget it . She could n't have pawned anything important  --  she did n't have anything . I 'll feel like a fool if " Pardon me , sir , can you tell me where the Park Place subway station is ? " It was an elderly woman with a rosy face and a funny black hat . He smiled at her . " Go to the other side of the park ? " He looked beyond her . They were on the other side of the park . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was on Chambers now .  | He changed the direction of his pointing finger . " Right there  --  near the Woolworth Building . " He crossed the park again quickly , angry with himself , and went back to the shop . Through the fly-specked window a dumpy man with a patch of black fuzz on the top of his head looked up over his glasses from behind the counter . Carl averted his eyes . What am I waiting for ? Just walk in " Mister Chapman ! " Even before the hand came down on his shoulder and the whisky cough exploded behind him , he knew who it was . Pop Farnsworth . Of all the times to be held up by this panhandling rummy ! Carl turned impatiently . " Hello , Pop . " The grubby old man with loose bloated cheeks and watered eyes , bowed . His dirty collar was a fixture held together by an old safety pin . His hat was a bet Carl had lost to him on the Sacco-Vanzetti trial . He rubbed a sleeve across his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chapman , away from his desk ! " He laughed again . Carl took a step away . At any point Pop 's insane sense of humor might explode in an hysteria that would attract a crowd . But Pop 's hand fastened on his arm . " Doing business down here ? Leave it to me . Know him  --  good friend of mine . " Pop winked . " Get you a good price . " " Never mind . " Carl jerked free . " Ah , now , Carl , do n't be like that . It 's me  --  Pop . "  | Me  --  Pop . . . Once this sodden , noisy , unshaven wreck had been the top-flight journalist on Park Row . It was hard to believe . Carl had genuine respect for the newspaperman Pop had been ; he felt only disgust for what Pop was now . " Here . " He pulled out a quarter , thrust it at the old man and walked off . His fingers had touched the ticket . He would get rid of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick of the whole business . He heard Pop 's shuffle behind him . Carl increased his pace . " Do n't bother me ! " But Pop was keeping up with him . " How about a half-a-buck ? " He was sure of himself , buoyant , undisturbed . " Beat it ! " " But , Carl  --  two-bits ! It 's not even a pick-me-up . " A round-shouldered son of Shem leaning against his second-hand clothes store front , chuckled . A fat tramp passing , called out , " Work him over right , Pop ! " Carl was losing his temper . " Quit pestering me ! " Pop clucked . " For shame  --  Carl Chapman  --  two-bits ! " " Pop  --  I 'm busy ! " " Ah , yes . . . too busy for an old friend . . . " Speech was undeterred by speed . Pop could go on , block after block . . . Carl stopped . " All right , all right ! " He jammed his hand into his pocket , pulled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do n't bother me for a year ! "  | He did n't wait . They were near the corner . He rounded it briskly . Now he would have to circle the block .. . " Hey , Carl ! " Pop was still following him . Now what ! Carl ducked into the nearest hallway . On either side of him were large garish drawings  --  a ship in full sail , a cross with a flaming heart in its center , St. George and the dragon , a pig 's head , ships ' propellers , nudes with upstanding breasts , Peter and the crowing cock . It was the entrance to a tattooing establishment . Damn that drunk ! " Carl ! Mr. Chapman ! " He slid behind a six-foot sign : Rock of Ages ? $1.5o . Pop went by , wheezing , grunting . Carl stayed in his refuge for hot uncounted minutes . When he emerged , cautiously , Pop had gone . Enough time wasted . There was work waiting for him . That convention story . The Governor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his desk . The meeting with the Comet 's lawyers on the defamation of character suit . He hurried toward the shop . He was impatient to have it over with . He reached for the ticket . His groping fingers missed it . He stopped and searched his pocket carefully . The ticket was gone . He had lost it . Perhaps when he had given Pop that quarter . . . He had been standing  --  there . . . Perhaps , absentmindedly , he had put it in another pocket . . . He went through them all while he scanned the sidewalk . " Lose somethin ' , mister ? "  | He looked up . A circle of faces , interested , derelict . He walked away from them retracing his steps , his eyes searching . . . He had gone this way . . . he had stopped here to give Pop the bill . . . turned the corner . . . The Rock of Ages . Perhaps it had dropped from his pocket . . . He went behind it , crouched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bottle caps , cigarette butts . " If you 're really religious , mister , I can put the Rock on for fifty dollars . Cover the whole back . Three colors . " He straightened . An anemic man in a smock with a Vandyke beard and crooked pince-nez beckoned . " I 'm Professor Hall . Come right in . Navy man ? " Carl held up a finger to a cruising cab . His temples throbbed with exasperation at the thought of the time thrown to the winds . . . his own fears . . . But as the cab started , he shrugged . Well , the ticket was lost . So that was that . He could forget it .  | Twelve Pop shuffled down Chatham Square . He crossed in front of the Newsboys ' Home , passed Hearst 's old journal building on the corner and rolled into a small saloon across from the defunct circulation platform . He spread himself at the bar and brought his fist down on it . " Ten whiskies ! " The only bartender in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a raw complexion and a face that was empty of everything , moved slowly toward him behind the bar , wiping a glass with a dirty towel . He weighed three hundred and seven pounds ; a photograph of him above the register proclaimed this to the ounce , with a caption : " The Fattest Bartender in New York . " " Line ' em up , Charlie  --  right here . " Pop drew a line across the dank bar . " Now , Mr. Farnsworth , " said Charlie respectfully , you know the boss told me ? " Pop waved the bill Carl had given him , let it drop to the bar . Charlie picked it up , examined it closely . " I did n't make it , my boy , " said Pop dryly.  | Charlie hesitated . " Do n't you want to hold out fifteen cents for a flop ? " Pop shook his head in a beatific negative . Charlie sighed . " Ten it is . " He lined them up and watched the spendthrift down three without a stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah . " Charlie leaned a melancholy elbow on the bar . " Remember the first time I served you ? " Pop picked up the fourth drink . " Let me see . . . Afternoon . . . October . . . That 's it , October eighteenth , 1910 . I just got back from the bombing of the Los Angeles Times . " Charlie beamed . " And you came right to Luchow 's . My first day there . " Pop gestured with the drink . " Luchow 's . " " That beer . . . " said Charlie dreamily . " Beer ? Liquid gold ! " Pop closed his eyes and swayed . " Tiny raw onions with every seidel . . pretzels and cheese and sausage and pickles and meats ? free  --  with every dripping schooner . . . He eyed the fifth drink with disgust . But drank it . Charlie scratched his stomach . " Ai n't what it used to be , Luchow 's . . . " He smiled in fond memory . " Remember the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass in front of the mellow Charlie . " The bar , " pushed another opposite it , " The pastry-counter , " and made a cross in front of the second glass . " There he was . . . Do I remember ? " Charlie stared at the mark with pleasure . " He ate up every bit of cheese cake . . . . Him and that  | Victor Herbert , they both had a record of twenty-two seidel of Wurzburger  --  without getting up ! " " My record was thirty , " said Pop nonchalantly . He made the sixth drink disappear , cleared his throat and began to sing . " Just order two seid-els of lager , or three , If I do n't want to drink it , please force it on me , The Rhine may be fine but a cold stein for mi-ine ? " Charlie joined him : " Down where the Wiirzburger flows . . " They laughed . Charlie blew his nose . " Ah , that Nora Bayes . . . " What good is water when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sang , " For a ship to sail on it is fine ; but to drink  --  well not me . ' She sung it different , " he said modestly . Pop , strangling over the sixth drink , wheezed , " Do n't stop , my boy , do n't stop . Give us that little ditty you ? " " Oh , no , Mr. Farnsworth , I could n't . " " Now , now , Charlie . Right after poor Louis Zucker rendered the classics on the piano , you came out . . . " Charlie set both hands on the bar , fixed his eyes on the opposite wall and put his heart into the song : " Oh where , oh where iss mein little dog gone ? Oh where , oh where can he be ? Mit his ears cut shord and his tail cut long ? Oh where , oh where can he be ? "  | Pop applauded vigorously . " Wonderful ! Wonderful ! " Charlie blushed . Pop downed his seventh drink . " Hope I can stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three in rapid succession , clung to the bar and shuddered violently . Then he recovered . " Ah , me . . . Charlie , I am a new man . Richard is himself again . ' " " Yes , Mr. Farnsworth . " Pop pushed himself away from the bar , achieved an equilibrium . Charlie leaned over the bar as far as his paunch would allow . " Mr. Farnsworth , I can let you have that fifteen cents for a flop , " he whispered . On his way out , Pop waved a graceful hand . " My boy , I am grateful . But " ? he pointed to the bill Charlie had not rung up ? " there are more like that , many more . I shall return with them anon . . . Boot , saddle , to horse , and away . ' " Veering and tacking , sonorously greeting alike those he knew and those he did n't , he made his way to the Comet building . . . He peered cautiously from behind the row of lockers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't at his desk . He moved quickly to the dead-end section of the floor . Julie Allison 's cave was there . She was almost hidden behind the pamphlets , mimeographed announcements , religious books , publicity puffs and stacks of invitations to Bible classes , Sunday schools , bazaars and Saturday night raffles  | piled on her ancient roll-top desk . The walls were covered with framed quotations from the Holy Book , full page cutouts of her department , autographed photos of priests , ministers , rabbis and Father Divine . He took off his hat and waited , humble , silent . But she did n't see him . It spoiled his effect . He had to cough . " Hello , Mr. Farnsworth . Come in . " She removed a batch of papers from a worn leather chair . " Sit down . " " No . . . I am not worthy . " Julie 's eyes twinkled . " What have you been up to now ? " Pop came in and sat gingerly on the edge of the chair . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between common sense and heroic sacrifice . " " My goodness . " " It was a problem never to be solved by the logarithms of philosophy , but by the simple arithmetic of the heart  --  and the lack of rupees . " " Oh , you mean you need money . " He blinked rapidly , gulped and blew his nose . Then as that did n't seem to move her , he added a touch of his grimy handkerchief to his eyes . Julie patted his knee . " Please do n't cry , Mr. Farnsworth . You know I 'll help you . " " You have already done more for me than any other mortal . " Pop groaned . " Oh , Miss Allison  --  I can never find myself again until I have righted a great wrong . " She hitched herself forward in the big swivel chair  | that could have held two of her . " Tell me , Mr. Farnsworth ; it will make you feel better . " " I have committed sacrilege . " She looked startled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought out a green pasteboard . His hands were shaking involuntarily ; he eyed them with artistic approval . " Here , " he said ; " it represents a treasure I had kept for years . " " Why , it 's a pawn ticket . " He breathed heavily . " Aye . . . " " Mr. Farnsworth ? " she leveled a finger at him , " what did you pawn ? " It was time for a sob . He sobbed . " My poor mother 's picture . " She looked thoughtful and puzzled , so he went on at once . " You hate me . You despise me . You loathe this shameless sinner before you , this despicable unfortunate who has an inferno raging in his heart , this Rabelaisian vulgarian whose earthiness ? " " How much do you need ? " " Ten dollars . " " Ten dollars  --  for a picture ? " " Framed in gold , " said Pop hastily . " But it is the picture I want . The rest is tinsel . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all meaningless to me . " Julie rummaged in her purse ; she looked troubled . " Ten dollars is a lot of money . . . I do n't think I have  --  no , I have n't . We 'll have to ask Mr. McCleary to help us . " " No ! " Pop was on his feet .  | " But why not ? " " He  --  uh  --  wo n't understand . " " Mr. Farnsworth , you 're mistaken . " Julie was in earnest . " Mr. McCleary is the kindest ? " " Some other time , Miss Allison . " Pop was firm . " Good-by . " He picked up the ticket , turned and came face to face with Lance lounging in the doorway . Lance grinned . " How much you tapping her for this time ? " Julie 's eyes brightened with the pleased smile they always had when she saw him . " You 're just in time . Mr. Farnsworth has a problem . " " She 's nice , " he told Pop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a paternal hand on Lance 's shoulder . " Lance , my lad , you are my bosom friend . I am devoted to you . You are youth . You belong to an adventurous tribe of males  --  undaunted  --  colors flying Lance tipped a wink to Julie , but she was watching the old man , listening to every word . Pop sighed gustily . Lance turned his face away . " Ah , were I but young again ! Aye , a chiel 's amang ye takin ' notes and faith , he 'll prent it . ' " He stepped backward , measured Lance dramatically . " Some tell , some bear , some judge of news ' " ? it was an accolade to Lance ? " some make it ! " " He means you ! " cried Julie . " Is n't that beautiful ? " Lance laughed . " All right , Pop ; what 's bothering you ? " " My conscience . "  | " Come again ? " Pop frowned righteously . " I am resolute in my sincerity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sigh . " My abnegation . . . " Lance squinted at it . " Where 'd you steal it ? " " Steal it ? Shades of Barabbas , you think me a rapparee ? It is mine ! I had to sacrifice honor for it . " " Whose ? " Pop glared . " I was forced to impignorate my mother 's portrait for a few pieces of gold . " " Ve-ry good , " drawled Lance judiciously . " Anyway , it 's different . " Julie pulled at his sleeve . " Do n't , Mr. McCleary . Ca n't you see how he 's feeling ? " He patted the top of her head . " The pay-off ? " he asked Pop . " Ten dollars . " " Fat chance ! " Julie put her hand on his arm . " Please , Mr. McCleary . . . " She was looking up at him with magic blue eyes . " But , Julie ? " " Please . . . " she repeated softly . He found his hand coming out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too late then . Pop 's eyes were devouring the greenbacks . " To your mother , " said Lance sourly and began a reluctant count . " One  --  two  --  three ? Let 's see that ticket again . " He examined it closely , tossed it on the desk and continued , " . . . Four  --  five  --  six  --  seven  --  eight ? That 's all I ? "  | " Sufficient , Lance , my lad . " Pop grabbed the money . " Keep the frame ! " He fled from the office . " He forgot the ticket , " said Julie . Lance grinned . The old reprobate . . . Just the same he had warmed , as he always did , to the repeated , " Lance , my lad . " When he was copy boy , it was an honor to have the great Farnsworth call him that , bliss to be noticed , and more , spoken to as an equal . The great man had taken Lance under his wing ; and with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hero worship and laid his love at his idol 's feet . And deep in his heart the adult knew he had never taken it back . . . Was there still a spark left in Pop of the Farnsworth who had rollicked through Europe interviewing kings and ministers with impious brutality , caught the first boat out of Liverpool to escape prison  --  and tore the heart of a nation with his personal story of the sinking of the Titanic ? Poor Pop . . . The bottle had always been his mistress ; but one day he married it , and he did n't believe in divorce . But if it were taken away from him , could he , a gay and seasoned veteran , ever return to his place in newsdom as one of its most pungent headliners ? Lance thought of Pop mooching , staggering through City Hall Park , sleeping on a bench behind Civic Virtue , searching for gin-drops in the empties scattered along Frankfort Alley  --  and sighed . Julie was looking up at him , smiling . " You really love that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly .  | He jammed his hands in his pockets . " You owe me eight bucks . " " Oh , Mr. McCleary . " " Do n't Oh , Mr. McCleary ' me . How could you fall for that line of  --  for his line ? You know he 's an orphan . " " So do you . " " You hypnotized me ! " He picked up the pawn ticket , dropped it into her palm . " Souvenir  --  eight bucks ' worth . " Her chin came up angrily . " If that 's all that 's bothering you  --  do n't worry , you 'll get them back ! " " You bet I will . Oh , Mr. McCleary ' has a long memory . " He stamped out , muttering , " Roping me in ? " But late that afternoon , he blessed the eight dollars . " What an investment , " he gloated . " Wait 'll I show Carl  --  boy , wait 'll I show Carl ! " He swaggered through the city room making as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He strode to the desk where Carl was balancing art in the dummy spread before him and looked about disgustedly . Rabble . . . You 're too good for this paper , McCleary . " If you 're sure I 've had enough of the McCleary profile ? " snapped Carl . My best audience . " I 've got the killer of Lonely Heart , " Lance announced loudly . " Where ? " " Right here at the city desk ! "  | Thirteen It 's a trap ! What 's he got on me ? Is he waiting for me to make a slip ? He 's all excited . He has got something . That 's impossible . But there 's no one with him . Do n't be ridiculous . He 's pulled that entrance before . He thinks he 's got something . Even so , it 's not like him to  --  What shall I do ? There 's only one thing I can do . I 'm not supposed to know anything . He came in and told me he nailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm supposed to get excited . " Where ? " Lance lifted his arm in an arc and brought a suitcase down on the desk with a crash . All heads jerked up . A suitcase ? Is that all ? But it must be important . Whose is it ? Could it be hers ? Where did he get it ? Wait  --  I must n't relax . " What in hell 's going on here ? " he roared . Lance clicked the latch and threw the suitcase open with a flourish . He was in his element . " Papa got a rattle for baby ! "  | Why does n't he get right to it ? Why does he have to be sensational ? The phone on his desk rang . He reached for it still looking up at Lance . If he 's putting on an act , I have nothing to be afraid of . Someone was blubbering faintly into the other end of the line . A man . " Carl ? " " Yes . " " I 'm sorry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't be angry , please do n't be angry . " Oh  --  Pop Farnsworth . " What do you want ? " Pop sniveled and groaned . " I 've a confession to make . I 'm plunged into sorrow . " His whisky cough tore into Carl 's ears . " . . . added a nail to my coffin " Get to the point ! " Pop whimpered . " Your tone  --  so sharp . . . Do n't blame you . I took the ticket . " Ticket ? So that 's where it was . Pop had it all the time . But how ? Pop was no thief . . . Of course ? when he had given him the bill . It must have been crumpled with it . . . . . . when you gave me the money .

Bring Lance . . . You 'll get your ticket back . . . Want to buy you a drink . . . Carl replaced the receiver slowly . Why could n't the ticket have been lost ? He jerked a thumb at the suitcase . " Well ? "  | Lance picked something out of the jumble of clothes , held it out triumphantly . " There they are ? Mr. and Mrs. Lonely Heart ! " It was a picture faded to a yellowish brown . . . They had passed a concession at Revere Beach . . . " Fifty cents , have your picture taken , fifty cents . " They had posed in front of the photographer 's flivver ; he had made a prop of it , hanging a Just Married sign across , tying old shoes and cans to the rear bumper . They had laughed at that . She was smiling up at him . Her profile was unmistakable . But he did not know himself . The photographer had turned him three-quarter view ; he had worn a mustache then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadow across his face . . . It is her suitcase . . . " Where 'd you get this ? " " Julie 's curiosity got the better of her and she went down to the hockshop . " " Make sense . " Lance told him about Pop . That 's why the old man 's on a crying jag . He 's not worried about the ticket ; he 's worried about Lance 's eight dollars . Oh Pop , you should have been satisfied with that quarter . . . " Did he tell you where he got the ticket ? " " Nah . He stuck to that line about his old lady until he nabbed my eight bucks . " Lance is excited . I do n't blame him . Too bad we 're not in on this together  --  cold . . . Carl phoned the reference department . " Bring me all the pictures on Lonely Heart . . . " Whey they were brought to him he compared the photographs . . . " Yes , that 's she .

" We 'll see what he looks like when we blow him up , " said Lance . I should have thought of that . Carl took it from him . He saw his face blown up to 8x11 , to 16X22 . . . No danger . Not a chance of being recognized . He tossed it on the desk . " See the license plate ? " said Lance . " Barely make it out . Twenty and two letters ? ' s ' and ' s ' . We know she comes from Mass . Throw it together and what we got ? They were married in Massachusetts in 1920 . " He struck a new pose . " How 's Papa doing ?

" Weak , Lance , weak . " And of course that 's the only one in New York . "  | " Look , Carl : O'Hanlon will tell you the ring was taken off recently . " " That 's right ; probably hocked it to get to the Ball . " " Will you stop it ? " shouted Lance . " I know my hunches . I tell you the killer took it ! " " Why ? " " Because there was an inscription on it . " Smart boy . " Got your crystal ball with you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What about the ring you gave Mrs. Chapman ? I 'll bet it has an inscription . " To Rose from Carl , with love . To Charlotte from John , with love . Easy now . Look what you 're doing ? tearing off the corner of the dummy . . . " You 're thinking like a legman ! " Lance reacted pugnaciously , ready to argue . But Carl went on . " You and your hunches . Wedding rings . Husbands . It 's twenty years since that picture was taken . He may be dead . Maybe he 's been married six times since then . Maybe he 's the two-headed boy at Coney Island . You want him to be the killer  --  so he 's the killer . McCleary waves his magic wand and the husband trots right into the Comet to fill page one . " Lance flushed . " Can you top it ? " " Sure I can top it ! Where did Pop get the ticket ? " " He may have found it . " " ' He may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story magazine . " He did n't like that . Now , again . " Use your head , Lance . " Ah  --  he 's getting it . Look at his eyes begin to shine  | . . . Lance smacked his forehead . " Holy smoke ! The killer ! " " Now we 're getting somewhere . Where did Pop get the ticket ? " He made it dramatic . " Somebody gave it to him . Of course he did n't find it . If he did he would n't have left it behind . He 'd have taken it with your money . But there was a reason why he left it . It 's simple . Was he drunk when you saw him ? " " He was doing all right . " " That 's it . The killer ? " Carl felt a rising exhilaration . " Let 's say I 'm the killer . I have the ticket and I 'm afraid to walk into the shop with it . Why ? Because I do n't know what she pawned . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid to ask . I 'm desperate . I 've got to do something .

I give him some money to go into the shop with the ticket . But he forgets the shop once he has some money . You know how quickly Pop can disappear . He drinks up the money . Now he 's in a spot . He sees a chance to raise cash on it . First Julie . Then you . But by this time he 's suspicious . Why did n't the man want to go into the shop ? Pop 's an old hand  --  knows all the tricks . He knows the ticket is hot . He feels it . It is n't kosher . He does n't want to have anything to do with it . He wants to sleep on park benches , not in the can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Julie 's desk . " Lance 's eyes were glued to him . " Find Pop  --  find the killer ! "  | I 've got him going . I 'll be able to get rid of him . " What 's his favorite hangout ? " " Humpty O'Dollar 's on Fourteenth . " " Start there and work down to the Bowery . Do n't miss a dive . Find Pop and Madison 'll drop a bonus in your lap . Get going . " " Gone ! " Lance hurried out of the city room . Carl pulled the dummy toward him . Ten minutes . . . I 'll wait ten minutes . He marked off two columns for a plane crash . Something jarred . What was it ? That airline ad ; it was right next to it . He riffled through the dummy to page twenty-one , measured the lines , drew one , wrote " airline crash . " The composing room foreman phoned . " We 're tight . Keep it down . " He marked three sticks from China to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in somewhere . He found room for it in the second section . Five minutes . . . He looked out the window ; it was getting dark . He saw the picture in detail : the waterfront , the docks , the river . . . Three minutes . He switched a restaurant ad next to the Broadway column , remembering a promise . " I 'm at Keene 's . " It was n't far ; on South , across from the fish markets . He even knew which dock would be the only witness . Keene 's was a block from the river . It had a big front window , a bar near by . He would tap on the window and Pop would come out and they 'd walk off together to the dock , laughing and drinking . Two minutes . He would rise and take his hat and  | go out for a walk and kill an old man . In his mind he walked from Keene 's to the dock . . . The dock , the river . . . He pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and walked out of the city room . He passed the elevator and walked down cement stairs . He pushed the glass door out , passed the cigar stand in the foyer and went toward South . Even walking there was easy . He was being taken to Keene 's by a force that understood him , that wanted to help him . South Street was quiet . A moon was coming up and he could smell fish and the river . Waterfront factories were quiet and dark . He passed an old woman poking around in the garbage near one of the markets ; a cat gnawing at a hunk of refuse . He saw the stern light of a tug hauling a line of loaded barges . He paused in front of a big plate glass window upon which was crudely painted : Keene 's . Pop was leaning against the bar , hunched over a half-filled bottle and weeping into his glass . Carl tapped on the window . Pop looked up , nodded , swooped the bottle to his breast and came out . He grabbed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I forgiven ? " he blubbered . Carl led him down the street . Pop hummed and swayed as he walked , leaning on Carl with his full weight . It did n't matter . Drunks lurching along the river were no novelty . They passed one sprawled out in a warehouse doorway . Pop slumped in a heap . Carl glanced up and down the street . This neighborhood was paradise for lushworkers . There was no cop . There were only the  | snores from the slob in the doorway and a moan from the tug . A new shadow was thrown on the ground . Carl looked over his shoulder . It was his own . The moon was over Brooklyn Bridge now . He pulled Pop up . " Come on , " he said ; " you want to buy Lance a drink , do n't you ? " Pop 's eyes were closed as he shook his head . His mouth opened and sputum ran down his chin . " Lance 's my lad . " " Take a drink . " Pop took one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Had to confess , " he said . Then recalling why , he burst into tears again . " Gave Lance the ticket . . . I 'll get it back . . . Spent his eight dollars . . . Have to help me , Carl . . . " He trembled , tottered around Carl making a zigzag circle and lurched against him . " Where 's the bottle ? " " Right in your hand . " They were approaching the dock . Pop took a deep drink . " Got to save some for Lance . It 's bonded . " " He 's waiting for us . " Suddenly Pop jerked free . " Do n't try to hold me back ! Do n't try to keep me from my lad . " He waved the bottle majestically . " Let us proceed . . . Carl had to use his strength to keep him from sliding to the ground again as they walked under the dock . It was the dock he had chosen from behind his desk . Pop fell back against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , belching .  | " Where 's the bottle ? " He found it in his lap and chuckled . Then a fresh flood of tears poured down his cheeks . " Lance 'll be angry . Got to straighten it out for me , Carl . " He stopped sobbing to cough . " Lance 's my lad , " he sang hoarsely . He tilted the bottle . . . " Good God  --  it 's happened ! " He was terrified . " Something 's wrong , Carl . I 'm sick . I ca n't swallow ! " " The cork . " " Oh . " Pop tittered foolishly , pulled the cork out with his teeth and spat it out . " In the way all the time ? you ! " He drained the bottle and began to whimper . " No more . . . no more for Lance . . . " His head fell on his chest . His eyes closed and he mumbled to himself , still clutching the bottle . Carl watched him . He could kick him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head under ? but drunks were hard to kill that way . He could strangle him . No ; he could n't touch him with his hands . On the ground were rocks . He could use that big one near Pop 's feet . One swift blow and it would be over . His fingers ached . He looked down and saw them twitching and gripping the moist air . He listened again ; Pop 's breathing was heavy , irregular . He found himself walking on tiptoe to something beyond the pile . It was an iron pipe , rusty and heavy . It was better than a rock ; something to grip . A rock would be clumsy . He picked it up . His thumb closed over his fingers around the pipe . It was solid , long enough . He tiptoed back to Pop and stood in front of him . He pushed the old fedora off Pop 's head . One good blow and it would be over . He lifted the pipe and again heard the moan from  | the tug and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barges ; dirty river ; bridge ; moon ; a drunk ; and a man standing over him with a pipe in his fist . He brought the pipe down No ! Not this way ! His hand was frozen above him . He locked his teeth against shouting . I ca n't do this ! I ca n't ! Not this way . I ca n't . I 'm sick . I 'm going to vomit . I ca n't kill him ! I was wrong . It is n't easy . I ca n't do it . It 's not right . It 's too cold . It 's wrong . It 's crazy . I 'm not crazy . I 'm not mad . I ca n't do this . I ca n't . I ca n't He brought the pipe down just as Pop 's head tilted back against the pile . It smashed the jaw . Pop groaned . His eyes opened and rolled . He gurgled . No ! No ! I ca n't go on ! You ca n't stop now . Hard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hard . He was breathing heavily . His fingers were grown to the pipe . The skull had been bashed down to the cheekbones . He lifted his arm and hurled the pipe . It left his fingers easily . There was a splash . The light from the tugboat winked . It was passing Dover Street now . He turned without looking back and walked . He crossed South . The same old woman . The cat was gone . Two sailors stumbled out of a quiet saloon on Roosevelt . He turned the corner . There down the block , closing the dead-end street , was the Cornet building . . . He stopped and took off his hat . The breeze was cool . He closed his eyes and drew a deep breath . It is easy . . .  | He lit a cigarette . His hands were trembling . But that was natural . The trembling stopped . He flipped away the match and went on . How good the cigarette tasted . . . He entered the Comet building . In the washroom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap newsprint used as towels . He went to his desk , hung his hat on the tree and sat down . The proofs of the more legible format and new type dress he had ordered were ready for him . He glanced at the editorial , called in the composing room foreman . He listened to his own criticism . It was brief and expert . " I told you to stick to that new body type . This editorial is still eight-point Paragon on ninepoint base . Sure there 's plenty of space between the lines , but I never want to see an editorial again in eight point . " The phone rang . Madison , to thank him for his advice on the defamation of character suit . It had been dropped . He hung up . He knew it would be . Madison was so easily hysterical . A young reporter , fresh out of journalism school , came up with an item : A religious woman who could " prove by the Bible that salt water 'll take the ticks off'n sheep " was outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a sheep . She 's got a bottle of salt water . I think she 's crazy , Mr. Chapman . She followed me back to the office . " " Probably a character actress for that new show .  | All right ; have Biddle get a shot of her and we 'll run it so you can get a couple of tickets . " The reporter flushed , stammered . " I 'm sorry , Mr. Chapman , I  --  I tried ? " " Forget it . Only in the future do n't try to mix publicity with work . " The reporter slunk away . Carl studied the assignment sheet . Lance had not got back yet .  | Fourteen On the low flat steps of soot-stained City Hall , Lance stretched his long legs before him , leaned back on his elbows , and watched the kids still splashing each other in the Civic Virtue fountain . He felt no guilt loafing on the steps . He was in love with doing nothing . He had several straight ryes in him and he was mellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all , Lance , m'boy , letting Carl send you out on an asinine search for Pop . This is worth it . So help me , he ought to be a director . He had me playing Trilby to his Svengali . No , he ought to be an actor . That speech about Pop and the killer ! I fell for it  --  me , McCleary  --  until I got outside . Then it hit me . Yep , that 's when . But do I get sore and tear back to raise hell ? Not me . I go and toy with some drinks and here I be . That " toy " is good . No , he ought to be writing detective stories . Can you imagine a killer smart enough to murder and get away with it , cunning enough to remove all marks of identification and set the stage for an accident , taking that damning evidence of a pawn ticket and just  | handing it over neatly to gin-soaked Pop ? Just to make it nice for us . For pulps he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticket ! But just because the big editor 's got an imagination , I 'm supposed to cover fifty thousand slophouses in this town and put my finger on the old man  --  ptt ! like that . What am I ? Superman ? He got out a pencil , slid down a little and snuggled his shoulder blades against the steps until he found the perfect position . Let 's see ? " Cap'n " Dickey 's cab to Humpty O'Dollar 's on Fourteenth . . . He shut his eyes and enjoyed the ride . Cab to Humpty 's ? 6o ? , he listed virtuously , peering at the folded copy paper through the growing dark . He muttered , " Keep the change , Cap , " and added : 150 tip . He settled down to some fancy robbery . Cab to Lafayette &; Howard ? 4o ? . What , would you cheat an honest working man ? He changed it to 65 ? inc. tip . Cab to Rivington and Orchard ? 5o ? and 500 tip . Fifty cents for a tip ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen Pop around Pell and Mott ? He pondered : without patting himself on the back , it might be said he had an unparalleled talent for investigation . He had proven it . Investigation was a challenge . But trying to find Pop in some Bowery gin-mill was n't  --  it was stupid . It was an insult . He resented it . It cost the Comet exactly seventy cents for phantom phone calls . Itemized drinks for imaginary bums who  | thought they knew Pop 's whereabouts brought the figure up to $5.80 . Satisfied with this petty larceny , he stuffed pencil and paper into his pocket , rested on his elbows again and yawned . . . Ah , McCleary , you were born too late . . . What a help you 'd have been to Greeley or Bennett . Sure you would have worn a paper collar , striped shirt , black derby and maybe even carried a cane . But you 'd have blasted the Tweed Ring , scribbled captions for Tom Nast 's cartoons and handled editorials for Harper 's Weekly , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right-hand man ; and when he invited all libel suits to keep his Tribune alert , you 'd tell him he was making a big mistake . " Oh , " he 'd say , " you do n't agree with me , Lance ? " And you 'd say , with dignity , " Nope , Horace , I do n't . " It was better with a cigar . He lit a cigar . " Nope , Horace , I do n't . " Was n't that stretching a point ? He tried again . " No , Mr. Greeley , I do n't . " That 's how it would have been . " McCleary , go find Livingstone . " " Where is he , Jim ? " " Somewhere in Africa . " " Sure , Jim . " If young Bennett wanted you to find Livingstone , all right , you 'd find him . But you would n't have said , " Dr. Livingstone , I presume . " Not you . Not the great McCleary . You 'd have said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never have gone down to posterity . . . Yup  --  there would be no newsreels to show you chartering a tug with three divers from Key West and finding proof that the Maine was sunk . . . McCleary  | goes down in a diver 's suit and finds the Maine for the World . Not bad , not bad . . . Old Pulitzer would beg you to take a pleasure jaunt with him to the Mediterranean . You 'd be cock o ' the walk . . . champagne at Mouquin 's , dates at the Astor House , dinners at the Waldorf . During the day you 'd be the Dostoievsky of Park Row , at night the dandy of New York . The idol of the press  --  McCleary  --  the swashbuckling reporter , smashing villains with a cobblestone fist , damning the wicked , protecting the weak Like hell you would . You have n't got what it takes . You had to be hard in those days . Tough and a go-getter like  --  well , like Pop . Now there was a newspaperman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was twenty and sober  --  boarding blind Pulitzer 's yacht for a job and being hurled overboard . Did he give up ? He crashed Pulitzer 's cabin five minutes later , shouted for a job and got it . Ah , Pop . " Lance , my lad , no newspaperman ever expunges the cloy of printer 's ink from his nostrils . " Did n't you , Pop ? But what a real swashbuckler ! Five years on the Globe and a bellyful of Tolstoy and what does he want to do ? Write classics ! Did you ever want to write classics , McCleary ? You did not . But Pop did . And of all the breaks  --  he gets there just in time to see Father Gapon and his petitioners shot down by the hundreds outside the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg . Did he forget Tolstoy ? Sure he did . He got drunk , and came back on the Globe with an eye-witness description of the massacre .  | That was a story ! He stretched his arms . Ho-hum  --  what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacred air . It was the same air they had breathed , those great newspapermen . And what are you , McCleary ? A call boy for a drunk ! He rose and stamped his feet . They had fallen asleep . It was getting chilly . The rye had worn off . Coffee would help . He passed a hoarse preacher who had chalked up the sidewalk with messages from God in front of the statue of Benjamin Franklin , and went into the Park Row Cafe . Its chairs looked ready to give way , the tables were patched together . Only the counter looked modern . It had been installed the day Peary reached the North Pole . He seated himself at a corner table . " Coffee . " " Ho-kay , Mac , " said the counterman . " Say , you got a nice rye look . Cream ? " " Lancelot McCleary ! " Lance turned . Old Man Sweeney , owner of the cafe , was hobbling eagerly over to his table . Ninety and stubborn as a dike , he always said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark . He might , at that . " Hello , Johnny . " " ' Bout time you showed up ! " Sweeney skidded , grabbed the corner of the table and lowered himself by degrees into the chair opposite ; Lance knew better than to help him . " Ai n't seen much of you ' round here . Where you been ? " Lance thought quickly . " Been eating in , " he said . " How you doing ? " Sweeney screwed his face into the grin caricatured  | by all New York 's cartoonists . " I 'm gon na outlive all you boys . " He cackled . " I started makin ' java when I was fifteen an ' I 'll keep on a-makin ' it when you 're all dead-'n-gone . I 'm the best java-maker on Park Row . " " Anything with the coffee , Mac ? " asked the counterman . " A bear 's claw , " said Lance . Sweeney snorted and . banged the table . " Nothin ' doin ' ! We got a plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dinty Moore got English blood in him ! " " Ho-kay ? " asked the counterman . " Ho-kay . " Sweeney put his elbows on the table and leaned on them . " They workin ' you hard , boy ? " " I 'm a slave , " said Lance . " Huh ; you do n't know what workin ' is . Why back in the days . . . It was coming . The saga of the Park Row Cafe was going to be retold and reenacted . Lance had heard it some thirteen years , it had been run as a perennial feature story in one paper or another ; he enjoyed it every time . He had never had the courage to interrupt the old man  --  but then , he never wanted to . . . from dawn to dawn , " Sweeney was saying . " You do n't know what tired is . But I did n't mind . The things I seen an ' heard , Lancelot . " Lance knew a moment of envy . " Did I ever tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Lance shook his head . " I do n't think you did . "  | " Well , it was about ten o'clock  --  Give Lancelot plenty o ' them boiled spuds ! " " Ho-kay. " ? durin ' the Draft Riots . Bad boys , them rioters ... bad . " The counterman placed the order before Lance and tiptoed away . " They 'd got after the nigger orphan asylum ? " Sweeney shoved the mustard across the table to Lance , " an ' burned it down . Right to the ground . Then they headed this way . " His eyes were fixed eerily on the door ; Lance , watching him , stopped chewing . " I saw ' em marchin ' right into Printin ' House Square . . . " Lance saw them too , a thousand of them , singing , " We 'll hang old Greeley to a sour apple tree and send him straight to Hell ! " " Be careful with that mustard , boy . I made it . . . They was yellin ' they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited . " Did they get into the building ? " asked Lance . " Get in ? They smashed in . An ' you know what they done ? " " They set it on fire ! " " That 's what they done . Smoke come right through that window . " Sweeney pointed . " Me ? I was washin ' dishes then an ' cleanin ' grill . The smoke fit to make me cough to death . " He coughed , overcome . ance pushed his water glass toward him . " Thanks , Lancelot . An ' then you know what happened ? " " No  --  what ? "  | " The back door busts open  --  an ' who comes flyin ' in here  --  but Horace Greeley ! Hear that , boy ? Horace Greeley ! " " No ! The old man himself ? " " That 's who ! " " What 'd he do ? " " He did n't wait a minute . He ducked under this table  --  right under this here table , Lancelot ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet are . " Lance moved his feet . " He was sweatin ' an ' scared . ' Save me , Johnny , save me ! ' he says . " " And did you ? " " O-ho , did I ? There was me , master of the situation . ' I 'll save you , Mr. Greeley , ' I says . An ' just a second before them Bowery boys busts in , I whips off a tablecloth , " Sweeney whipped an imaginary cloth from the table , " an ' I throwed it over him ! " " And they did n't find him ! " " They did n't . Me , Johnny Sweeney , I saved him from bein ' swung ! " He leaned back , panting . " What a night ! " said Lance . " I do n't think I could have stood it . " But the story was n't finished . " Was he grateful ? " Sweeney was . " Not him . He 'd come in here an ' sit where you 're sittin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothin ' happened . " " It 's the same coffee , " muttered Lance . " You 'd think he 'd give me a subscription for life to his paper , would n't you ? " " Sure I would . "  | " Well , no such thing . I still had to plunk down my two cents every time I bought a Tribune ! How about a piece of pie ? " " Could n't hold it . Johnny , would you like a life subscription to the Comet ? " Sweeney licked his lips . " You mean it ? " He put out his hand . " Put ' er there , Lancelot . " They shook hands solemnly . " Any time you get into trouble like that , " Sweeney jabbed a leathery finger at the air in the direction of Lance 's nose . " You come to me too ! " " I will , " promised Lance . He left the cafe in a glow the rye could not have given him . . . Outside the Comet , the pressroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basement . News trucks were backed up to the loading platform , their drivers circled around a hot crap game . He stopped to look on . Mechanically his hand went to his pocket ; but he resisted . He went on , smug in the thought that he could turn his back successfully on temptation . Jackson of the pressroom waved a paper-hook as he passed . He went up to the city room whistling . In the wire room a bell clanged a " must " ; one of the copy boys hurried in and ripped the story from the teletype machine . Most of the rewrites were busy . Lights were blazing over the art department and Monroe in the slot was checking names from the Who 's Who . The same old routine . . . Ah , yes , McCleary , you were born too late . The glow faded . You 're just another reporter destined to end up on the copy desk  | or playing poker with rookies at police headquarters . " Where 's Mr. Chapman ? " he asked a boy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and met Carl just coming out of the photo room . " Bring him with you ? " said Carl . " Who gave it to him ? " " Could n't find him . " " That 's bad . He 's liable to run into the killer again . " " For the love of Mike , Carl , I could n't look in the alleys too ! He 's probably sleeping it off in one of them . " " Well , never mind now . You 're just in time . I can use you . You like to mug . Come on . " Lance followed him back into the photo room . There , the rubicund Amos Biddle was not allowing business to interfere with pleasure . He was trying to date a pretty , giggling girl , one of the secretaries from the advertising department . He looked doleful at the interruption . " Set up ? " said Carl . Biddle grunted and got behind the camera . " I 've got somebody who 's ham enough to give us a good performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting the murder of Lonely Heart . You 're the killer . " Lance was bored . Old stuff , a composite . They 'd paste Lonely Heart 's head on the girl 's body , cut out his face and replace it with a question mark . He sniffed . " There 's a funny smell here . " " Sheep , " said Carl . " Ready , Biddle ? " The cameraman was ogling the girl . " Biddle ! "  | " Yeah , boss ! " Carl moved the girl into position in front of a drabgray drop . " Stand in front of her , Lance . Now , Tina , dig your nails into his hair . And Lance , I want your arm out , coming around to hit her . " He stepped back . " Can you see her fingers in his hair , Biddle ? " " Got it . " " Strike her , Lance , " said Carl . " No , not like that . Make it look real . Here  --  watch me . " Lance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head . I would n't punch like that . But why worry ? It 's his show . . . He stepped before the camera and faked a right . " Got it , " said Biddle . " Fall , Tina , " ordered Carl . " Go on , fall ! " Tina dropped . " Got it , " said Biddle . " Now hold your head up a few inches , Tina , as if you ? " Carl looked around , took a small cardboard box from a shelf and put it on the floor . " Rest your head on that and look dead . " " Got it , " said Biddle . " That 's all , Tina , " said Carl . " Thanks . Collins ! " A man wearing a rubber apron came out of the dark room . Biddle gave him the plates . " Bring those in as soon as they 're ready , " Carl ordered . " Come on , Lance . " Lance followed him out and down the corridor . Carl paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A short slight man appeared behind him . " Hello , Mr. Chapman , " he said when Carl straightened and wiped his mouth . " I 'm Swan . Just off the San Diego  | Sun . They folded . Shainmark told me to mention him . " " What did you do ? " " On the rim . " " See Monroe . " " Thanks . " In the news room Carl put out his hand . " Let 's have it . " Lance dropped his swindle sheet on the desk , watched Carl out of the corner of his eye . " Fifty cents for a tip ? " asked Carl . " What for ? " " The driver told me he saw Pop around Pell and Mott . " Did n't catch me on that one . I was prepared . . . Carl scribbled an okay on the sheet . " That rape fiend was finally caught  --  a shoe clerk from Canarsie . " He gave Lance the story . " Yerkes muffed on it . You 're supposed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . " Last month it was perspicuous . " He started for his desk . Coster , the picture editor , stopped him . " There was a phone call for you , Lance . " That dinner date with Julie ! " It was Dr. O'Hanlon . " O'Hanlon ? " What did he want ? " " It 's about Pop Farnsworth . They just picked him up near the river . Someone bashed his head in . He 's down at the Morgue now . " Coster returned to his table . Lance looked after him in a daze . He turned to Carl . " What 'd he say ? " " Pop 's dead . Killed . I told you to find him . " Killed ? Pop killed ? Head bashed in ? The Morgue ?  | " Poor miserable souse , " murmured Carl . Who 'd want to kill Pop ? Who 'd want to hurt that old ? The ticket ! That goddam ticket ! Carl was right . It 's the same killer . . . He got away with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away with it this time . He 's not going to get away with it this time . I 've got to get him . I 'll get him . He lost control . " I 'll get that rat if it 's the last thing I do ! "  | Fifteen So he 's going to get me . . . He 's so young , so determined , so emotional . I did n't know he cared for the old man that much . Too bad it had to be Pop . . . " Well , what are you waiting for ? " Carl said . " Call the Morgue , get the details . He was a drunk but it 's still murder . " Wait a minute . . . there 's something in this . I ca n't put my finger on it . A new angle . . . How can I use it ? Suddenly the old excitement gripped him . He saw the lead , the follow-up . . . He would splash it in red and black , the redder the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or had it just come in a prescient flash ? He did n't know . He heard himself say , " Hold it . " It was hard to keep his voice even . Lance was waiting . Carl ran his eyes over the boys at their desks : Prindle was on politics , Gibson on sleeping sickness , Payne on divorce , Rogers on theft ? " Rogers . " An unfriendly caricature of a typical Yankee un-  | hitched himself from his typewriter and strolled to the desk . Carl held out a hand to Lance . " I 'll take that . " " Rehash this , " he told Rogers . " Dig up stuff on Jack the Ripper and Vacher . Make comparisons between them and this shoe clerk . " Rogers nodded and took the shoe clerk back with him . Carl smiled at Lance . " Well , your baby 's crawling . " Lance looked blank . " Pop , " said Carl . " I do n't get it . " " From now on Pop and Lonely Heart are Siamese twins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do , bury him too ? " " No , run him . " " On what ? " " Imagination . " " I 'll take castor oil . " " Or the Canons of Journalism ' for your birthday ! " said Carl sarcastically . " So I 'm sentimental ! " flared Lance . " But  --  damn it , this is Farnsworth . " Still a hero worshiper , at his age . He makes me feel so gray . . . " And we 're making him a great newshawk who died in harness  --  who gave his life for a story . " " Loud cheers . " I 'll put a stop to this . " Get off the soapbox ! " He saw the effect of his voice on Lance . Lance shrugged . " All right , I 'm off . " He conceded grudgingly . " What 's your slant ? " On a sheet of copy paper Carl scribbled : " LONELY  | HEART SLAYER STRIKES AGAIN ! " and shoved it at Lance . " That 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pop got the ticket and gave it to you . He was suspicious . The eight bucks never happened . You went down to the pawnshop , came back with her suitcase . The picture tied Pop right up with the killer . We told him to dig . He was an old newspaperman , the best of his era . He dug and came up with a clue leading to the apprehension of the killer  --  but he was bashed in the head before he got to the office . Pop 's a hero , I 'm a genius , you 're a wonder boy , the readers are happy , the members are thrilled , and the cops want to cut our throats . " Lance had to try twice before he could speak . " Of all the crazy things I ever heard ! How are you going to make it stick ? " " Simple . Pop phoned . " " Phoned who ? When ? " " Me . He got the dope and phoned me , telling me he was on his way up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Lance scratched his chin . " Yeah , that 'll work . No , wait , there 's a flaw . Maybe he was rolled . " " Plant dough on him . " Lance shook his head . " You do n't miss a trick . " " Are you still in this room , " said Carl , " or do you want me to write it myself ? " He picked up the phone , called circulation . " What 's the run ? " " Seven-forty-five . " " Make it seven-sixty-five . " He hung up . " If we do n't jump twenty thousand with this yarn , " he told Lance , " I 'll eat your hat . "  | " You 're the boss , " said Lance . " I 'll have baby on roller skates before I 'm through . Only it 's your baby now. , , " Here 's your line-up : Stolen pawn ticket bares Lonely Heart 's marriage . Dean of reporters slain on way to Comet to reveal killer . " " Put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the club . " Lance turned on his heel . But Carl was satisfied . Lance was sour . The story would sparkle . He lined up page one . Two columns for the picture of " Mr. and Mrs. Lonely Heart . " Mr. and Mrs. Lonely Heart . . . He remembered his qualms about Charlotte and he could have laughed aloud . He relished again the story he was manufacturing , the machine he was setting in motion . . . He was the potent hub . When before had the man with the green eyeshade such a run ? Always the editor recorded ; could only rely on rumor and believe an eyewitness ; was only an echo of action . But he was different . To the average editor , to any editor , this would be a nightmare . But not to him . He felt himself tower over the men in the news room . He looked about , savoring his own omnipotence . " Lance , " he called , " do n't forget the picture from the suitcase . Go heavy on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only thing that makes sense , " came back Lance . " He 's the killer or I 'll eat your hat ! " You wo n't have to . . . Carl measured off two columns for the photo , wrote the caption himself : DO YOU RECOGNIZE THIS MAN ? HE IS LONELY HEART 'S HUSBAND . THE COMET  | WILL PAY $5,000 TO ANYONE WHO CAN IDENTIFY HIM . He could imagine Madison , " Five thousand ? Have you lost your mind ? Have you gone ? " And himself , " If he 's identified , I 'll pay the reward myself . " Lance 's copy would be just enough for a flash ; not even enough for a jump . Color , a boxed extra . Collins , from the dark room , spread the drying photos for the composite in front of him . Carl saw startling scenes of violence caught by Biddle 's lens . He called the tall head of the art department to his desk and pointed . " That 's one , that 's two , that 's three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first rough in about twenty minutes , Mr. Chapman . " Lance 's fingers were flying over his keys ; he was still wearing the expression of an executioner . Carl chuckled . He gave a boy the bannerline he had written . " Take this down to fudge . Wait for the proof . " The boy left . What was Lance doing with that story ? " You writing a novel ? " Lance ripped the copy out of his machine and brought it to him . The lead was perfect , as Carl had known it would be . But Lance was pale . " Sick ? " " Headache , " said Lance . " Take an aspirin . " " Forget it . " Lance walked out of the news room . Carl read the story , found it flawless , shot it into the composing room . The composite layout of Lonely Heart 's murder was brought to him . He studied it .  | " Your continuity is all wrong . Picture one is him striking her ; two is digging her nails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead . Paint a row of arrows to the bathroom . Plant a copy of the Comet . Not enough airbrush here . I want the foot of the bed played up more . " Proofs were dumped on the desk . He hurried into the composing room with them , had his usual argument with the foreman . " Ca n't you get your boys to slug these right ? " he exploded . There was the usual alibi . He started back to his desk . He heard an operator call out , " Pick-up  --  McCleary . " Carl stood behind him , watched Lance 's story flow through the linotype , raw , hot , shaping itself in molten metal . . . Lance has gone to the Morgue . He 'll learn it was an iron pipe . . . He 'll learn that Pop was so drunk he did n't know what hit him . That will make Lance feel better . . . Then he 'll go out and get drunk . What else will he find out ? What else can he find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . But his threat ? I wonder if that was just hysterics . I wonder if he meant it . Hysterics make headlines . . . That 's good . I can use it . I can use that threat . I know it . . . Of course I can use it ! Lance , you 're a godsend.  | Sixteen It was the first time Lance hated to go there . He had always been the outsider ; now he felt like a relative . The presses had begun to roll . He could feel their vibration through the sidewalk . " Hi , Mr. McCleary . " A driver with the face of an English bull was leaning against a fender of his cab . He grinned hopefully . He was Lance 's favorite hack . " Hello , Cap . " Cap'n Dickey swung open the cab door . " You do n't want to take the subway , Mr. McCleary . " " Okay , I do n't . " Lance climbed in . " Morgue . " " Somebody dead again ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was tellin ' the boys about how we went down an ' found out that dame was murdered . They did n't believe me till they read it in the paper . I told them about the funeral too . Now they call me Joe Scoop . " He guffawed . " Good , huh ? This one a dame too ? " " No. "  | " Hey , that reminds me ? " Cap remembered a new bawdy story he was sure Lance had not heard . He told it with gusto , lowering his voice genteelly on forbidden words . He was disappointed in Lance 's reaction . " What'sa matter ? Do n't you feel good ? " " Headache . " " I bet it 's your stomach . When I ? " " Come on , Cap , step on it . " " Oh , this one 's a big shot , huh ? " When they pulled up with a screech at the Morgue , Lance said , " Stick around . " " You bet . " The interview with Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . When he came out , Cap said , " Hey , now you do n't look good . " Lance told him to drive to the nearest bar . Cap fished hopefully . " Another murder ? " " Yes . " Cap peered back over his shoulder . " You ai n't excited like last time . What'sa matter ? Jeez , ai n't a relative ? " " No . " " You do n't act like you got a story , Mr. McCleary . " Lance said nothing . When he was paid off , Cap tried again . " Want I should stick around , huh ? " For the first time Lance smiled . " You 're a good guy , Cap . But  --  no . " He pushed his way to the crowded bar , tossed a bill across it and got it back in rye . A girl snuggled up to him . " Blue , mister ? "  | He ignored her and clung to his glass . He made a bet with himself : the sixth drink would kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting drunk ? He remembered . He had lost a friend . . . He was alone in his grief . Of all the people in New York there was no one to mourn Pop . Only me . . . He took another drink . O'Hanlon would understand . He called me , did n't he ? It 's a shame he has to work . But that 's how it is . . . " Look , sister , I 'm not blue . Peddle it somewhere else . " You 're in despair , McCleary . You ought to do something about it . He thought deeply and came up with four alternatives . He itemized them with pre-cision : 1 . Get going . He had threatened before Carl and God to get Pop 's slayer . Getting soused is a waste of time , McCleary . It 's an indication of mawkishness. 2 . Think . What leads had he ? He was like a magnet when it came to leads . But there was nothing around . Just a headache . 3 . Keep sober @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with liquor under his belt even when he was well-informed . He needed a hunch ; the rye was delaying the birth . 4 . Get good and drunk . Drunk  --  hunch . . . No , they did n't rhyme . But it could be that after a bender he could make them rhyme . Number four was the best . " No , sister , I have n't a match . " Make Pop a hero , that 's what Carl said . And he 's  | right too . It gives Pop a swell exit even if it is phony . Me , I have to go moral and sound off like a high priest of journalism . He ought to have kicked me in the pants . " No , sister , I do n't know no Don Wiley . " But Carl should have set aside a special spot for Pop , an honor corner  --  all by itself ; that 's what he should have done . On the editorial page . Not too heavy a border . " Say , bartender , got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The machine was an old Royal ; he patted it fondly . He poured himself a drink from a fresh pint and crouched over the typewriter . A tribute  --  that 's what this is going to be . He typed : " Pop is dead . The great Richard Farnsworth , whose blood and ink made newspaper history , is dead . " He read that over . Now do n't get maudlin , McCleary . Keep it simple . Concise . He banged the carriage to the right , went on : " The golden shower of matrices are his children , the roar of the presses are but the echoes of his voice . . . " He finished , feeling sure this obituary would have delighted Pop , folded it affectionately and put it into an inside pocket . Then he took it out again . What about the honor corner on the editorial page ? Why wait ? There was a telephone on the desk . He used it to summon a messenger boy . He gave the boy the tribute and made him raise his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of Carl Chapman himself and none other . After that he stared at the machine and tried to  | collect his thoughts . What was the next move he had planned ? Oh yes , the bottle . . . His headache was worse . He was nauseous . He had to get out . He prowled through the streets in an ugly mood , careened into a small bar , treated the tavern to a mass souse in the hope that generosity would cheer him . It did n't . Depressed , he made the rounds . . . He came lurching out of a saloon and shoved through a crowd surrounding a wily little antitongued rabble-rouser . He always had hated rabblerousers . He began to heckle with a ragged salvo of abuse . A few pro handclaps encouraged him to more direct pungency . The little orator raised his hand ; the antis rushed Lance . He loved it . . . A burly anti kicked him . Lance slugged him twice . He was hit on the head and went down , swinging all the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the battleground . " I been tailing you , Mr. McCleary , " panted Cap Dickey . He brushed Lance off anxiously . " You okay ? " Lance lifted the driver 's yellow cap and patted his square head . " Never touched me , " he said and passed out . He came to as he was being half-dragged , halfguided down a corridor . " Turkish bath ? " he chirped . " No , sir . " Cap knocked on a door . " It 's me  --  Cap Dickey , " he called . " I 'm with Mr. McCleary . " The door swung open . Julie stood there . " Hello , beautiful , " said Lance . She stared at him . " What happened ? " " Drunk , " said Cap . " Mr. McCleary ! "  | Lance pushed away from Cap and staggered past her into the apartment . " I would n't have brung him here , Miss Allison , " Cap was explaining worriedly , " except that all the way in my cab he kept yelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denied Lance hotly . Cap was respectful but firm . " Yes , you did , Mr. McCleary . " " Did n't ! " He turned to Julie . " Did I ? " He collapsed on the divan and peered up at them through blurred eyes . " Want I should take him home , Miss Allison ? " asked Cap . " No , " declared Lance . " Maybe we ought to try to get him more sober , " said Julie . He let them go to work on him with ice cubes and hot coffee . . . Finally Julie said , " I think he 'll be all right now . How much does he owe you ? " " Aw , he 'll see me tomorrow . Take it easy , Mr. McCleary . " Lance heard Julie say , " Thanks , Cap . " The door closed . When he opened his eyes she was standing over him . She looked so little and cute glaring down at him with her hands on her hips . She was wearing something blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the waist . He reached for the bow . She slapped his hand away and began to lecture him roundly . . . the dinner date he had forgotten . . . getting drunk instead . . . his shameful condition . . . his brazenness . . .  | She paused for breath . " Mr. McCleary , are you listening ? " " Yes , Julie . " " Then why do n't you say something ? " " You 're a cutie , Julie . " " I do n't mean that . " " Got nothing else to say . . . Julie , I do n't feel good . " Her attitude changed instantly . She put a tender hand on his forehead . " You hear about Pop ? " he asked . She nodded , stroked his hair gently . " Is that why you got drunk ? " He wanted to say yes , but he knew that it would be a lie . . . He had to face it . He could avoid it no longer . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is ? " Words flowed from him incoherently . . . his sullen brooding flared into profane self-accusation , startling her . " What do you mean you killed him ? " she said . " I should have looked for him . . . Carl sent me out to look for him and what did I do ? I was smart so I did nothing . " He rose , steadying himself against the table . " I could have saved him . Go on , say it ! I could have found him . Sure I could 've . Carl warned me but I played wise guy . I did a lot of fancy nothing . . . And all the while Pop 's hat is off and he 's drunk and he does n't see that iron pipe coming down . . . " " Ah , do n't . " She led him back to the divan . " Oh , Julie , I feel so  --  so . . . " I know , darling , " she said . " You feel like crying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. McCleary . . . Soft blackness was waiting for him . He wanted to sink into it . But he had to tell her something . It was important . " Julie , remind me to hide under a table , " he managed to say . " Do n't forget . Remind me . . . " Sleep caught him so quickly that he heard his first snore . . . It was a crisp morning . He hated it . Avoiding the sun , he walked to the corner cafe . He caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror behind the coffee urn . He looked awful . He was bathed and shaved but he looked awful . This was one morning he should n't go to work . What he needed was peace and quiet and a comforting cool hand against his brow . What would be waiting for him at the office  --  parricide ? matricide ? infanticide ? fratricide ? Or perhaps a poisoning before lunch , a garroting after and an unidentified skull in a crock to sharpen his appetite for dinner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough of murders , ax , hex and cult . . . enough of dismembered bodies in trunks , in closets , buried in gardens ; he was fed up with arms in barrels and legs in boxes , bones in cement and guns in reservoirs . Why should he waste his youth being a clue chaser , digging up thrills for sensation-hungry morons , when he could be preparing himself for a loftier , a more respectable position ? " You do n't have to cover crime to be a great newspaperman , " she had said . He agreed with her . He  | could handle a column , cover ship news , makeup , write heads , rim or rewrite . . . a dozen jobs were his for the asking in the craft he loved . Crime was n't the only thing he shone at . Yes , certainly Julie was right . But after a pint of tomato juice spiked with Worcestershire , ham and eggs and three cups of coffee , she did n't know what she was talking about . He lit a cigar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to desert crime for copy slashing ? He strutted to the Comet , enjoying the cigar and the morning with deep inhalations , and looked forward eagerly to a new day of horror , terror and thrills . The newsboy around the corner handed him a fresh edition and caught the flipped coin in one practiced sweep . " Hope you get 'm , Mr. McCleary . " " Thanks , son , " said Lance benevolently . Then it occurred to him : Hope I get who ? He found the answer in the headline . He took one look at it and was on his way into the Comet building , up to the city room and through it to Carl 's desk . He slammed the paper on the desk . " This is a hell of a joke ! " Carl looked up and smiled . " How 's the hangover ? " Lance thumped page one . " Never mind that  --  how about this ? " Unperturbed , Carl leaned back and rocked . " You went to the Morgue last night , did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you find ? " " Nothing . What about this publicity ? " " What was he hit with ? " " Iron pipe . Quit playing Legree , Carl . "  | " How do they know  --  they find it ? " " No . Crumbs of rust and metal filings in what was left of the head . He was so drunk he did n't know what hit him . This is a dirty trick ! " " What is ? " asked Car innocently . He leaned forward , glanced at the bannerline . To Lance it seemed to be the only type : " I 'LL GET KILLER ! " SWEARS REPORTER . " Oh , that , " said Carl . " Had to use something for replate . " " Replate first edition , eh ? You were so stuck you had to dig up something strictly between you and me . " Lance glared at the details . They were all there : his search for Pop and the hunt through the Bowery ; his race against the unknown murderer ; his failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dramatic interpretation of his oath " to get " the homicidal maniac who bludgeoned the head of his best friend , his idol . . . " You 're the big hero now , " said Carl . " I 'm the patsy ! " bellowed Lance . " Get off the soapbox ! ' That 's a fine thing to tell me and then splash my speech all over town . You 're making me a Rover Boy . " " You 're taking it like one . " " It wo n't be our throats , it 'll be mine the cops will want to cut , " Lance went on infuriatedly . " I do n't stand a chance getting a spot on another sheet if I wanted to quit  --  which I do n't . But you can take your Northwest Mounted Police angle and ? " Julie , passing , caroled , " Good morning , Mr. McCleary . Hide under the table . "  | Lance 's mouth was still open . Carl shook his head . " So you were that crocked last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She 's crazy . " " Oh , Mr. McCleary , " mocked Carl . Lance knew he should n't have come to work this morning . " That 's got nothing to do with this . If you think I 'm going to be the fall-guy for you and have ? " He clapped his hand to his forehead . " Hide under the table ? Holy smoke ! " " What 's the matter ? " Lance grinned , his wrath forgotten . " You made me what I am today , I hope you 're satisfied . ' " Carl was mystified . " What were you drinking last night ? " " Brainstorms . You know what Julie just did ? She threw a lead into my lap . I forgot all about it . " " I suppose the killer 's waiting for you under that table , " said Carl dryly . " Or his friend , " said Lance . He started away and walked into two grim officers . " Who 's McCleary here ? " asked one of them . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What did I do last night ? Carl rose , enjoying the intrusion . " You mean Lancelot Seumas McCleary ? " he asked . A couple of copy boys stared at the officers , popeyed . All over the room members of the staff were leaving their desks and converging to the spot . " Yeah , " said the cop . " Tall , skinny , redheaded reporter . " He took in Lance 's length with one slow deliberate look . " You 're the bird . "  | They grabbed Lance under the arms , started out with him . " Hey , wait a minute , what 's the charge ? " he demanded . " Do n't try nothing funny , " warned one of the cops , " or we 'll have to get rough . " Dragged through the news room , Lance saw Carl laughing , Julie speechless , the staff surprisingly amused . He yelled , " Get a lawyer ! "  | Seventeen Police Commissioner Blathmac Seanaman , short , swart and tousled , with a minimum of neck and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leaned back in his big office chair with his feet dangling a foot from the floor , no picture of municipal dignity . " McCleary , " he snapped , " you 've got a black heart . " " Me ? " Lance was injured . " What about your strong-arm boys making that phony pinch ? " When the Commissioner flew off the handle , as he frequently did , his voice grew shrill . " I ordered you picked up soon as I read that headline . It 's a cheap way to poke fun at the force . " " But I did n't have anything to do with it , " protested Lance . The Commissioner sprang up . Barrel-chested and haughty , he stamped about his swank office . " Do n't give me that . What do you know about the killer that we do n't ? " " Not a thing . "  | " What about that pawn ticket ? How did you get it ? " " Through a fluke . " " That 's fine , " the Commissioner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained about the ticket . " Well , part of that 's believable . But how do you know the killer of Lonely Heart 's the same man who got Pop Farnsworth ? " " Hunch . " To his native Ireland the Commissioner owed his temper , to New York his livelihood , to crime his fame and , at the moment , to Lance his apoplexy . " Quit playing Nick Carter ! What are the facts ? " " Oh , facts . In the first place , Pop did n't phone my paper . " " Pipe-dream ? " Lance nodded . " And I did n't go to the hockshop . Julie Allison did . " " In other words you do n't know a thing . " " That 's what I said . " " And you 're working on a hunch that Farnsworth knew too much and was killed by the Lonely Heart slayer . " " Right . " The phone rang . The Commissioner barked into it , " I told you to tell that ink-stained parasite not to bother me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's been calling me ever since you were picked up . " Lance grinned . " He 's really a great guy when you get to know him . "  | " He 's a menace , and so are you and so is that paper you work for . We 've been at it day and night trying to track down that woman 's identity . Next thing , Pop Farnsworth 's killed and now we have two on the same card . Those stunts your boss pulls are going to get him into a mess one of these days . " " You 've got to admit that so far he 's ringing the bell . " " It 's cheap . Papers today are n't what they used to be . They 're trouble-makers , liars . Another thing ? what 's this about a killer hiding under the table ? " Lance said , " I give up . This is like a hick town . One crack and in ten minutes everybody knows it . " " Well , what about it ? " Lance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ? " The Commissioner was reluctant . " All right . But if I read about any arrests in your paper before we make them ? " " I 'll tip you off first , " said Lance . " How about a ride ? " The Commissioner snorted , but arranged for a police car to drive Lance anywhere he ordered . " If you make a slip , " he said , " and happen to get your boss instead of the killer , I 'll make you a lieutenant . " Lance had himself driven to the Park Row Cafe . Old Man Sweeney was grinding coffee in the kitchen , and in rhythm chewing tobacco and singing Yankee Doodle in a cracked quavering falsetto . " Good morning , Lancelot . " " Johnny , " said Lance , " tell Greeley to move over . " Sweeney blinked , thought , got it . " Trouble ? "  | " Plenty . " The old man rubbed his hands excitedly . " Need help , eh ? " " That 's what I 'm here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sweeney led the way to the same corner table . " Fire away , son . " Lance fired away . Sweeney listened intently . " So now you want to know who saw him ? " he said . " Well , you 've come to the right place . Get back about ? make it three . I 'll have ' em all here by then . " Outside the cafe , Lance ruminated . He ought to go back to the office . But Carl had laughed when the cops hauled him out . Let Carl wait and worry . Carl 's angle had been that the killer hung around the pawnshop , wary , until Pop had happened by . The first logical step , then , was the shop . He found the proprietor in great distress . The police had been there ; they had questioned him ; they had taken the ticket . Lance reflected amusedly that the Commissioner had wasted no time . " And now they 're sending detectives , " moaned the dumpy little man . " You police  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed the impression that he was a plainclothes man to remain . " You knew Pop , did n't you ? " he asked . The proprietor brushed his face with his hands as if he had walked through cobwebs . " I 'll tell you what I told them , Mr. McCleary . I 'm an intellectual , an idealist . I ignore the flotsam and jetsam which floats past my store . But Pop  --  who did n't know him ? "  | He shook his head . " It 's a disgrace to the newspaper profession to let a man like that be buried in Potter 's Field . " Lance liked him for that . " He 's being taken care of . Did you see him yesterday ? " " They asked that , too . Sure , I saw him . When did n't I see him ? " " I mean did he come in ? " " Why should he come in ? Look , he was standing there . " The proprietor 's pointing finger placed Pop just outside the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sold a camera . One of those old Univexes . That flapjack girl in Childs ' , she wanted it for months and yesterday she came in and bought it . " " What time was it ? " " Oh  --  the time . Why did n't you say so ? It was about one . She told me she had to be back at her window grill by one and she was late . " About one . . . Lance made a mental note to remember that . " What was he doing  --  just standing there ? Did he say anything ? " " He did n't say nothing to me . " Patience , McCleary , patience . " You mean he did speak to someone ? " " Oh , sure . The man who was standing there first . Pop came up and slapped him on the back and then ? " The man who was standing there first . " Wait a minute , about this man  --  who was he ? " " I should know ? He was some fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display . He was a funny fellow . " " Funny ? " " You know what I mean  --  maybe he was embarrassed . In this business , Mr. McCleary , you know how it is , sometimes if it 's the first time , it is n't easy to come in . I could tell you ? " " Some other time . But about this man ? " " Well , he went by once and then he came back and he stood there like he could n't make up his mind and then Pop came up to him  --  and later he came back again and still he did n't come in . " Lance was tingling . But it had come too fast . " One thing at a time , please . Let 's get this straight . This man went past once  --  right ? " " That 's right . " That 's how Carl had figured it . The killer was afraid to walk straight in with the ticket . " Then he came back . " " I told you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then Pop ? " And then Pop came along . You say he slapped the man on the back . " Then Pop must have known him . " Then what happened ? " " What should happen ? Pop touched him . " " For how much ? " " You think I got eyes like opera glasses ? " " But you 're sure he got a handout ? Could you hear what Pop said ? " " With my door closed ? I do n't listen to other people 's conversation , Mr. McCleary . The man gave Pop something . "  | You 're getting warmer and warmer . " What ? " " How should I know ? He gave him something . " The ticket  --  he gave him the ticket . " Then what ? " " He went away like I told you . " " But Pop did n't come in . " " Look , Mr. McCleary , I already said he did n't . " It was all working out . " Which way did the man go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward Hester Street . Before Lance could ask his next question , it was anticipated . " Pop went that way too , ' . ' said the proprietor . That was odd . If Pop wanted to get away . . . But it did n't matter . " Then you say the man came back . Was he alone ? " " Yes . " " What did he do ? " " Nothing . He did n't stay long . Then he went away again and he never came back . Funny , no ? " He was waiting for Pop . But Pop had disappeared . " What did the man look like ? " " Like a man . " With an effort Lance kept his voice jocular . " Oh , come now . You must have some idea of his appearance . " The proprietor flashed a gold-toothed smile meant to be ingratiating . " I 'm not a smart detective like you , Mr. McCleary . " " But was he short ? Tall ? Skinny ? Fat ? Did he wear a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Wait , wait , Mr. McCleary . Let me show you . Here , come behind the counter . " He waited until  | Lance stood beside him . " Now , " said the proprietor , " you look . " Lance watched the street . Men shuffled past the doorway ; others idled to stare at the collection of junk in the window . One man loitered near the doorway for a few seconds , went on his way . Two girls stopped , one of them pointed at some article near the cameras . They left . " Well ? " asked the proprietor . " What did the third man look like ? " Even prepared as he had been , Lance could n't remember . " You win , " he said . He went to the door . " Thanks . That 's all now . " " But tell me , Mr. McCleary , what is with this man ? how he looked , where he went ? I thought it was off . " He may be the murderer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , looked back and grinned . The pawnbroker was still gaping at him . Lance waved and started in the direction of Hester Street . Next door was a low vaudeville house . The girl in the booth said , " Oh , Pop Farnsworth . Is n't that a shame ? I just read about him in the paper . " But she did n't remember seeing him pass the day before . He went on to a " haberdashery and firemen 's outfits " and drew a blank there ; to a notions shop which outfitted street merchants , hawkers , Times Square pitchmen , where the counter was cluttered with trick key rings , watches , fake matches , exploding cigars . The worn-out blonde behind it concentrated , vaguely  | recollected Pop passing the store , but she was n't positive  --  he had passed so often . Lance continued with the frail , wistful meerschaum carver next door . Surrounded by pipes he had made , still exhibiting the gold medal his father had won at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition in 1876 , the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been busy on a new pipe . Lance did n't give up . He quizzed the cabinetmaker , the pharmacist , the hardware dealer , the hamburger-stand owner , the gypsy fortune teller , the round-shouldered owner of a second-hand clothing store . " Sure , " said the clothes-dealer , " I saw him yesterday . . . right after I got through eatin ' . " Lance took a deep breath . At last . " Was he alone ? " " No , he was followin ' some guy . Pop was puttin ' the bee on him . " " How far did he follow him ? " " I could only see to the corner . I was outside takin ' it easy . I got a kick out the way Pop was makin ' this guy nervous . I could tell . " So the killer had been nervous . Lance did n't doubt it . " Which way did they go then ? " " The guy beat it fast around the corner . " " Toward Chrystie ? " " Yeah  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What did this man look like ? " " Search me . " " You mean you ca n't even remember whether he was tall or ? " The clothes-dealer shrugged . " Who cares ? I seen  | Pop milk so many guys I do n't pay no attention to the sucker . " " You did n't hear what they said , did you ? " " Too far away . " " Thanks . " " There 's somethin ' else , mister . " Lance turned back quickly . The clothes-dealer beckoned with both hands . " For eighteen-fifty I got a blue pin-stripe just your size . It 'll bring you luck . " Lance escaped the clutching hands just in time . He went around the corner . There was Chrystie and beyond that Forsyth and Eldridge and Allen and Orchard . . . Pop could have gone to one of a dozen places on each street . Lance dropped into a few saloons , learned Pop had n't been at any of the local bars the day before . He recalled that it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight dollars out of him . He wondered if Pop had said anything to Julie about the ticket other than what he , Lance , had heard . It would be a good idea to make the Cornet his next step . The Wall Street Close edition was out ; he glanced at the headline : COMET REPORTER ARRESTED . The subhead was even better : MCCLEARY GRILLED " KNOWS TOO MUCH ! " POLICE RESENT REFUSAL TO BARE VITAL FACTS . Lance could n't help chuckling . Blathmac would rave when he read that . That crazy Carl ; he 'd headline a grunt if it had anything to do with the story . The boy at the information desk leaped up as Lance  | came out of the elevator . " Gee , Mr. McCleary , what 'd they do ? They grill you ? Third degree ? " " They were pretty tough , " said Lance seriously . He went on to Julie 's office . Excited and indignant at the same time , she was all questions and exclamations . " Do n't believe what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He made her go over every word Pop had said , but learned nothing . Carl was waiting for him . " Why did n't you phone ? What happened ? " Lance rolled his eyes . " They should 've thrown you into solitary ! " snorted Carl . " What 've you been doing ? " " Getting vital facts , ' " said Lance . " Give me one . " " Pop knew the killer . " That was vital enough Lance could see . Carl said slowly . " Who told you that ? " Lance gave him a rapid digest of his conversation with the pawnbroker . " Could he describe the man ? " asked Carl . " None of them could . " " What do you mean none of them ? " Lance recounted his coverage of the block . He saw grudging admiration in Carl 's look and affected nonchalance . " See you later . " " Where you going now ? " said Carl . " I 'm not finished collecting vital facts . Got a hunch one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Do n't forget to let me in on it , " drawled Carl .  | Eighteen Lance found the Park Row Cafe transformed into the meeting room of a rescue mission . It smelled of old fish , filth , sour milk and sweat . Some twenty bums were crowding the place . Lance , taller than any of them , could see Sweeney holding forth in the rear ? he was telling three of them they were welcome to the washroom but he 'd crack the head of the first one who dirtied it . He saw Lance . " Come on in , boy . " All faces turned to Lance . His eyes swept over them . This was the circle of human scum in which Pop had moved  --  these derelicts , corner cripples , lushers , tipsters , slophouse stock . Feeling like a plutocrat , he pushed through aging failure to Sweeney . " Told you my grapevine would work , " said the old man triumphantly . " Every one of ' em seen Pop yesterday . " " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it ? " " Passed the word there 'd be no more grub handouts unless , " said Sweeney simply . " Now go ahead an ' start your spiel . An ' do n't let ' em scare you , I 'm right behind you . " He raised his voice , addressing  | them , " This here 's my friend , Lancelot McCleary of the Comet ? " " The Times keeps you warmer , " said a bum . There was a ripple of laughter . Sweeney glared . " He 's tryin ' to get some idea together to help him find the man who killed Pop ? " " How about some grub first ? " shouted a one-eyed souse . A chorus followed his demand . Sweeney 's eyes blazed . He whipped a cane from the hands of a seated cripple and brandished it angrily . " Listen , y'dirty bums ! " he shouted . " I 've never turned one of you away an ' you know it . How many cups o ' coffee , bowls of mush an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? Now you dish out to me , y'hear ? No talk  --  no grub . " Lance was sorry for them ; their eyes darted from the enraged Sweeney to the pies on the shelf , the steaming soup and beef-stew pots . Still breathing fire Sweeney turned to him . " Now go on , Lancelot . First one gives you trouble I 'll crack his head . " Lance cleared his throat , not knowing how to begin . They were staring at his shoes , his nails , his tie , staring blankly , apathetically . He cleared his throat again . " Men , " he began , knowing instantly it was a hollow and pale opening , " what happened to Pop Farnsworth could have happened to any one of you . " It did n't seem to matter to any of them . " The killer is still at large . Understand ? " he went on as if he were addressing a group of ten-year-olds . " The man who killed Pop is still walking around . He  | might pick out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your head bashed in like Pop ? " The only head-bashing they seemed interested in was Sweeney 's cane . " Sweeney tells me you saw Pop yesterday . I want to know everything . When you saw him , where , was he with anyone , did he say anything , was he drunk , was he sober  --  anything and everything I can think of ? I 'll ask . Now , are you men ready ? " Silence . Sweeney lifted the cane . They rose and roared proof that they were ready . Close-mouthed moochers became loquacious ; gabble spread through the cafe ; mutes were suddenly long-winded . Lance had to shout for order . " One at a time , " he cried . " You ? " he pointed to a pot-bellied bum . " Where did you see Pop ? " " At Cherry and Market . " " About what time ? " The bum sucked false teeth in . " Mm ? ' bout five I guess . They was listenin ' to the radio . " " What radio ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where ? " " At the Shamrock . " " Did Pop stay there long ? " " He was there when I came in . " " What time was that ? " " I just told you . Five o'clock . " " How long did he stay there ? " " He did n't . He was raisin ' hell with the radio when  | I went in . You know Pop , he did n't like swing music . " " So you 're sure he left the Shamrock about five ? " " Yeah . " " How drunk was he ? " " Stiff  --  an ' flashin ' a roll . " " He did n't flash no roll when I seen him , " said a hollow-cheeked sickly tramp . Lance turned to him . " When was that ? " " Ca n't remember . Say about two . Maybe a little later . " " Where ? " " James Street . " " What direction was he coming from ? " " New Bowery . " " Tell you where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't flash no roll . I know Pop . If he had a roll he 'd a'flashed it . " Lance shot questions at the others . Some of them had seen Pop near Hester . What time ? About one or thereabouts . Alone ? Yes , he was alone . Others remembered running into him on Chatham Square . What time ? Oh , a little after one . " How ' bout that grub ? " cackled the one-eyed souse . " Shut up ! " blared Sweeney . " But I seen Pop , " whined the one-eyed souse . " When ? " asked Lance . " This mornin ' . " " Throw him out ! " roared the bums . The one-eyed souse was given the bum 's rush . Sweeney waved the cane . " Any more wise guys ? " A horny bum said , " I seen Pop last night . " " Where ? "  | " Keene 's . " " What time ? " " Lemme see . . . I hadda leave to get to th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once y'miss that feed bag y'got one more chance , but when y'miss that second chance , y'do n't get even a whiff of them pork chops or pigs ' feet or ? " " What time ? " " Seven on th ' nose . " " Was he alone ? " " Sure . " " Still flashing a roll ? " " Nope . " " Did you leave before he did ? " " Nope , right after him . " " And you saw him walking off ? " " Sure , they was gon na kill th ' bottle . Pop gim me a swig of it . Bonded stuff . He must 've scratched a sucker an ' ? " Lance dodged through tables and leaped upon the startled man . " You said they were going to kill the bottle ! " The man found his tongue . " Yeah . " " I thought you said he was alone ? " " In Keene 's he was . I meant outside ? " " In other words you saw him leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside the joint he met a man . That right ? " " Yeah . " " The man was waiting for him ? " " Du n no . . . Pop was cryin ' . " " Why ? "  | " I du n no . Did n't say a word to me . I dropped into Keene 's to use th ' can an ' on th ' way out Pop gim me a swig an ' I beat it to th ' mission . " " And you saw him walk off with that stranger ? " " Yeah . " " Tall man ? " " Du n no . " " Short man ? " " Du n no . " " Well , was he fat or skinny or a cripple or did he wear glasses or a beard or a hat ? " " Du n no . " " Was he a bum ? " " Du n no . . . I had no time to see . I hadda beat it back to Chatham Square . " " Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ th ' river . " " Did the stranger poke his head into Keene 's ? " ' ' Du n no . " " Pop just walked out , then , as if the stranger were waiting for him ? " " Yeah , I guess so . He walked out hangin ' onto his bottle an ' cryin ' . " Lance felt his scalp creep . Why had Pop been crying ? Had it been fear ? Could it have been fear ? Had he had an inkling of what was coming ? He faced the others . " Did anyone see him after seven o'clock last night ? " They pondered , disputed among themselves . Some of them enjoyed playing detective , others felt important ; most of them did n't seem to give a damn . One pock-marked parasite rose .  | " I was takin ' a snooze on the Journal platform when he come out . " " From where ? " " Charlie 's . " " What time ? " " Two o'clock . " " Oh . " The bum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it was two ' cause the Salvation Army tries their high c 's every day in front of Newsboys ' Home at two . They woke me up . " " Did you speak to him ? " " Nope . " " Did anyone meet him ? " " I do n't think so . He was alone when he came out an ' I ? " " Did you go into Charlie 's ? " " Nah . Pop 's the only guy which ever got a shot on the house at Charlie 's . " " Which way did he go ? " " Search me . I went back to sleep . " " Say , mister ! " came a shout from the rear . " Fire away , Grubby , " encouraged Sweeney . Grubby , an old-school hobo , shuffled to the front . " I remember meetin ' Pop . It was n't seven yet . He had a fistful of dough . " " Where was that ? " " Not far from my flop . . . ' round Cherry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He could'a'been headin ' for Dip 's . Yeah , come to think of it , he was goin ' to Dip's. "  | Lance raised his voice . " Anyone see him at Dip 's Tavern ? " A wrinkled midget , armless , stamped his feet on the floor . " Me ! " Lance lifted the midget to a table . " What time was that ? " " Around three . He asked Dip for a pint of Black Gold an ' was thrown out . Then I seen him countin ' paper money . So did Dip an ' he got him back again . Pop told him to go to hell but Dip gave him a shot on the house an ' Pop got his Black Gold . That 's bonded stuff , y'know . " " Did anyone see him between five and seven ? " asked Lance . In a few minutes by a ferocious arithmetical dispute between them , he had one thing clarified : no one had seen Pop between five and seven or after he left Keene 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no notes ; they were n't necessary . His mind sifted , tabulated , filed . Now he could figure out where Pop went after he turned the corner at Bowery and Hester ; according to the time , he had made his way directly down Chatham Square to Charlie 's . Too many had seen him on the Square between one and one-fifteen , and it would only take about fifteen minutes to get to Charlie 's from the pawnshop . From Charlie 's Pop had gone to the Comet ; he himself had seen him about two-fifteen in Julie 's office , perhaps two-thirty . The midget had seen him at Dip 's around three ;  | the pot-bellied bum vouched it was five when Pop was at the Shamrock . It was n't so complicated now : Pop left the Comet a capitalist with eight dollars and dropped into Dip 's , just a couple blocks away , got his pint of Black Gold , hung around for drinks , then went to the Shamrock . If he left the Shamrock at five and Keene 's at seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have contacted the killer , arranged to meet him at Keene 's by seven . He had been crying . It was just possible he made that seven o'clock appointment with the killer . " Do yourself any good ? " asked Sweeney . " Ca n't tell yet . " Sweeney bristled . " If you think they 're holdin ' out on you ? " Lance laughed . " No , they came through . Put the feed bag on them and I 'll get a fat check for you from the paper . " Sweeney frowned . " I ai n't doin ' this for the paper . I 'm doin ' it for you , son . " Lance patted him on the back . " I know , Johnny ? and thanks . But what the hell , it 's not out of my pocket . " Following the route he had been able to map out as having been taken by Pop the day before , Lance went first to Charlie 's . The fat bartender was unashamedly emotional . " There 'll never be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unable to help Lance . Pop had paid  | for and downed ten drinks , sung songs and seemed happy . That was all Charlie knew . " You 're sure he did n't say anything about a pawn ticket ? " asked Lance . " Not a word . " " He did n't happen to mention where he got the dollar ? " " No , but he told me he 'd be back with more money ? lots of it , he said . " Lance mulled that over . Pop had had only the one dollar at that time . Had the killer given it to him to go into the pawnshop and find out what had been pawned and what it would cost to redeem it ? Or had it been a much larger sum which Pop had squandered quickly ? But what made him so sure he was going to get more money ? Would it have been from the killer  --  or had Pop known then that he was going to tap Julie ? It was a problem for which Lance could find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pop had spent an hour or so at Charlie 's ; according to the itinerary he had gone from there to the Comet . Lance skipped that , went directly to Dip 's Tavern . He learned that Pop had breezed in about a quarter to three , had left forty-five minutes later ; it was at Dip 's that the first of the embezzled eight dollars had been flourished and spent . But that was all ; no one could remember anything Pop had said . The next stop was the Shamrock . . . Pop had stumbled in about three-forty-five , remained until five . " Any idea where he went from here ? " asked Lance . The bull-necked bartender tugged at his ear ,  | squinted , had no idea about anything . But an ancient Negro shining the footrail looked up and said softly , " I know . Pop told me . He was my friend . I hope you get the man who killed him , mister . " There was something about the sad , doggy eyes that got Lance . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I 'm trying to ? Where 'd he go ? " " To Sal 's . " Would this fill the gap between five and seven in Pop 's route ? Lance hurried to Water and Market Streets and entered Tammany Sal 's broken-down bar . She was alone . Sprawled at a table , she was reading a love story magazine . Her body sagged with memories , but her face had a personality undisturbed by days of neglect . It was beautiful . Sloppy , dirty , her body was a nightmare , her face a voluptuary 's dream . Looking at it , he could believe the stories about her and the prominent men who had loved her . She had out-beautied all the Bowery hetaerae and achieved her name through being the political bigwigs ' robust delight . When he ran copy she had loved to tease him about his innocence ; and once when he delivered a message to his editor , she had kissed him . He could still remember his blush . " Hello , Sal . " She lifted her eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , do you ? " She was looking at him steadily . " I 'm Lance McCleary . I used to ? " " That redheaded kid ! " She got to her feet , put her hands on his arms . " My God , you 're big  --  a real skyscraper . Here , sit down . "  | She pushed him into a chair , stood over him . " All grown-up now , are n't you , kid ? But that carrot brillo is still the same . " She ran her fingers through his hair . " Red and thick and  --  hot . . . " He was embarrassed . He was twenty-eight and a top crime reporter , he had seen mayhem , rape , corruption  --  but he was embarrassed . He ducked his head as if he were the copy boy again . She laughed and sat down opposite him . " What can I do for you , boy  --  I hope ? " " It 's about Pop Farnsworth . " She groaned . " Ah , poor old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was drinking with him just last night . " " What time was that ? " " After five sometime . " " How long was he here , Sal ? " " Left after six . Say , you got nice eyes . " " Thanks . How was he ? " " Like a board , " she said . " I 've seen him stiff , but last night ? " she whistled . " No , I mean did he act as if he was afraid of some-thing  --  someone ? " " Not Richard . You know , Red , you got nice hands too . " " Ah , come on Sal , this is serious . " Her leg pressed against his . " So am I. " " Look , all I 'm trying to find out is whether he said something  --  anything that might give me a lead on who killed him . " " You 're wasting your time . He was probably rolled . How old are you now ? " " Did he say anything about a ticket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to know now , are n't you ? " " Try to remember , Sal , " begged Lance . " I will if you hold my hand . " He held her hand . She squeezed his . She said , " He did say something about a ticket . . . " He was suspicious . " What kind ? " " Hockshop . " He leaned forward . " What did he say ? " She glanced around . " It 's not comfortable here , Red . Let 's go upstairs to my ? " He caught himself stammering . " Sorry , Sal , I 'm on the job now . " " You mean maybe later ? ? " " Maybe , " he lied . She released his hand , threw back her head and roared with laughter . " All right , Red , I wo n't kid you anymore . . . I do n't know what he said . He was so drunk I could n't make out anything ; probably did n't know what he was talking about himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , honey . Oh  --  he broke half-a-buck for some nickels . " " What for ? " " He wanted to make a call , he said . " " To whom ? " " I have n't got a phone here . " She sighed . " It is n't like it used to be . They all used to come to see Tammany Sal . Now I have n't even got a phone . " " But did n't he mention whom he wanted to call ? " " No . " He rose . " Well , thanks , Sal . "  | " It 's all right , Red . " She walked him to the door . " You still got nice eyes . " She laughed again and patted his backside as he left . He walked to Keene 's slowly . So Pop had wanted to make a call . . . Had he made it ? And from where ? Keene was a treasure-store of Bowery biography . He had reached the sentimental sixties and was infatuated with his own reminiscences . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They get the fella yet ? " he asked . " Cops are still looking for him . " " You got an idea ? " " Digging for one . He left here seven last night , did n't he ? " " Uh-huh . " " What time did he get here ? " " Little after six . He was over at Sal 's . " Lance took a chance . " Did he make a call from here ? " " Yeah  --  from the booth . " Lance 's nerves tightened . " Did you hear him ? " " No , he shut the door . Said he was going to call some chap , said he had to . " " How long was he on the phone ? " " About a minute or two . " " What time was that ? " " A little before seven . Maybe a quarter to  --  maybe six-thirty . " " What did he do then ? " " Came back to the bar and stood here drinking and crying into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " Was he crying before or after he came out of the booth ? " " After . He came out blubbering like a kid . " Lance almost slammed his fist down on the bar . He had been right . Pop had known the killer , had called to make an appointment to meet him , the killer had probably threatened him over the phone and Pop had wept because he was scared . . . " Did he watch that clock as if he had a date ? " he asked . Keene was getting bored with the subject . " Look , McCleary  --  Pop was n't the only customer . You know , you remind me ? " He was getting ready to dip into history . Lance said quickly , " Did n't he make any crack about having to meet somebody ? " " No . As I was saying ? " " Did you see anyone waiting for him outside ? " " No . " Keene gave up Lance as a listener . " Here . " He shoved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar to a customer at a table . His voice came back , raised in loving recital . Lance absently poured himself a drink , but with the glass an inch from his lips thought better of it . Not after last night . He put it down and leaned on the bar . Now what ? He had interviewed a great many people , had covered a lot of territory ; he had enough leads for dozens of short stories , boxed human interest profiles , unusual quotes , unusual backgrounds , unusual characters . But he had no lead on the killer . He was right back where he had started from . Yet he knew he was close to something  --  he sensed it . All this groping . .  | " Are you McCleary ? " He turned from the bar . A miserable specimen of a man , filthy and furtive , waited for his answer . " Yes . " Large unusually lucid and brilliant eyes met his . " You do n't know me , do you ? " " No . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger . " I 'm fiftyfive years old , have four human children , six human grandchildren , weigh about one hundred and forty pounds ; I eat , sleep , scratch myself and hate lice ; but I am not a man . " He came closer . " I 'm a lot of things , McCleary . I 'm the black sheep of Gotham 's flock , the whisky breath of Stephen Foster , the oldest street in the United States , the tea-water pump . I am the Henry Astor of the Fly Market , Priest of the Parish , Murderer 's Alley , the Dead Rabbits . I am exaggerated humor , intense filth . I am an accomplished linguist , can hold my tongue in English , Spanish , French , Italian , German , Hungarian , Polish , Yiddish . I am the rise of the gangs . I am also a mystery . I am Bowery . " There was an explanation for the eyes and all this . " You 're full of hop , " said Lance . " Yes-s , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want ? " " Nothing . " A bony finger was pointed at Lance . " It 's you . You want something . " " Such as ? " " Information . I have it . " " About Pop ? " Lance was skeptical . " I can help you , McCleary. "  | " What do you know ? " " Nothing . But a friend of mine saw Pop yesterday ; his account of Farnsworth 's doings , I assure you , will interest you . " " Where is this friend ? " The stranger put his head to one side . " High stakes make the turn of the wheel interesting . " What could he lose ? " Five bucks if he knows anything , " said Lance . " The game has begun . " The stranger put out his hand . " At least a dollar for the first turn . A mere formality . " Lance gave it to him . " Let 's go . " The hophead lagged behind . " Oh , " said Lance . " Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do not misinterpret my hesitation . " Lance lost his temper . " Quit stalling for another touch ! Get going or I 'll have Sweeney put the finger on you . " It worked . " Come , " said the hophead . " I shall lead the way . . . The Elite Hotel on Bowery near Pump Street was flanked by wretched store fronts . Lance followed him up the stairs and past the clerk 's cage on the first landing , with its variety of signs : No Credit ; No Fighting ; No Spitting . The place stank of disinfectants . A score of bums were in a big room , most of them asleep on iron cots . There was a triple row of these coffin-bunks , narrow lockers between them , and hanging overhead were unshaded electric bulbs encased in metal mesh . The hophead went down the second row and halted in front of a cot . Lance , right behind  | him , saw a bulky bum hugging the dirty sheet , snoring loudly . He smelled of disinfectant , stale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is he , " said the hophead . Lance shook a blubbery shoulder roughly . The fat man snorted . " I paid my dime . " " Get up , " snapped Lance . Merciless , he would n't allow the leviathan to drop back to sleep . Eyes still closed , the bum heaved himself up , swung his feet to the floor . Lance fired a question at him . The fat man wiped his face with his sleeve . " Sure I seen ' im , " he mumbled . " Right near th ' hockshop . " " Alone ? " " No . He was ? Hey , who 're you ? " " Never mind me . If you saw him with the right guy you 'll make yourself twenty bucks . " The fat man , wide awake , got to his feet . " Whaddya wan na know ? " " When did you see Pop ? " " ' Bout one . " The hophead jabbed a finger into the belly that gave . " Go on , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " All I told ' em was I seen Pop workin ' a sucker an ' I yelled him good luck , " said the fat man plaintively . " Do you remember the sucker ? " " Sure . " It could n't be true . " You mean you know what he looks like ? " " Sure . "  | Lance 's voice rose . " You can identify him ? " " Sure . " " Do n't talk ! Do n't say another word ! Come on . " Lance grabbed him . Let him stink . He was precious .  | Nineteen Carl saw a palpably excited Lance dragging a fat bum by one arm through the city room . The bum seemed bewildered , breathless ; he was flapping one hand as if to give himself air . . . He watched their progress amusedly . Was this Lance 's ultimate " vital fact ? " Then suddenly the air was alive with danger . A bum . . . The Bowery . He saw me  --  I know it ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No  --  I would n't have been noticed if it had n't been for Pop .. . Not until they reached him did Lance release the bum ; he swung him around to the side of the desk . Lance was red-faced , panting . " I 've got the man who can identify the killer . " I knew he would say that . Now this bum will point at me and yell , " That 's him ! " The fat man came closer , bent toward him . Carl drew back from the stench that came to him in a wave . " You th ' boss ? " Does that surprise him ? His kind instinctively  | respects authority . Maybe that will make him unsure . . . " I told him I 'd take him right to the boss himself , " explained Lance . The bum must have described the man . Lance could n't have connected the description with me . How could he ? There 's nothing unusual about me . The bum 's hesitating . I was right . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I . . . " Well , come on , do n't waste my time . You saw the killer ? " " Yessir . " " Where ? " " I seen him with Pop near Brown 's hockshop . " He 's staring at me . He 's thinking he must have made a mistake , it could n't be me he saw , not the boss . " You can describe him ? " " Yessir . " I must n't be too impatient . It might make him truculent . Then he 'll want to accuse me . " Go ahead . What does he look like ? " Lance took a cigarette from a pack . The bum gestured for one . Lance gave it to him . The bum waited for a light . Lance struck a match . The bum took a long puff . His manner 's changed ; making Lance light the cigarette for him has given him assurance . " Stand up , willya ? " said the fat man . Not that tone to me , you bum ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fat man . I 've got to get up . . . Lance looks surprised . He had n't expected this . And afterward I must n't be excited or angry . I must act as if I thought the bum  | was drunk and tell Lance to throw him out . But I must n't overdo it , I must n't talk too much . I must make Lance forget it . He rose . The fat man studied him , enjoying momentary importance , taking his time . What is he waiting for ? Why does n't he say it ? " Yeah , that 's what I figgered , " said the bum . " He was ' bout th ' same size as you . " And ? " ' Bout as old as you too , I guess . " And ? " He was n't wearin ' no topcoat . " And ? The bum was looking at him as if he expected comment . Was he finished ? Could that be all ? " What else ? " " Nothin ' . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mister , it was n't me puttin ' th ' bee on ' m . " He does n't recognize me , he does n't remember me , he did n't from the beginning ! Or is he cleverer than I thought ? Is he waiting to shake me down later ? No , poor bastard , he 's being honest about this in his own stupid way . He turned to Lance . " So you 've got the man . . . " Lance was dismayed . " I thought . . . I would n't let him talk . I wanted you to get it fresh . " Carl sat down . It was good to sit down , good not to have to watch himself any more . He asked the burn crisply , " Did n't he have any distinguishing features ?

It could fit me . " The fat man squirmed . " Down goes McCleary , " said Lance . " Want to make ten dollars ? " asked Carl . The bum hiked up his pants . " He said it 'd be twenny . " " He 's a philanthropist , " said Carl dryly . " But all right . Can you write your name ? " " Sure . " The bum was proud . He scrawled it across a sheet of copy paper . Carl gave the autograph to a passing boy . " Get a one-column cut on this . " He phoned the cashier . " I 'm signing a voucher for twenty dollars to Ben Bailey . Honor it . " He handed it to the bum . " You 'll get your money from the cashier . Upstairs , one flight . Thanks . Sign this release , too . " " Tell you one thing , Mr. Chapman , " said the bum humbly . " Next time I see that guy , I 'll know ' m . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How ' bout another cigarette ? " Lance gave him the near-emptied pack . Clutching it and the voucher as if they were equally rare , the bum lumbered off . Lance hunched his shoulders and jammed his hands into his pockets . " Go on , say it . " " Forget it , " said Carl . " You know what to do . His signature will make a good byline . Put it in Bowery lingo . The police will have him identifying every picture in their files . "  | " I must have been tired . He was last on the list . " " What list ? " Lance was disgusted . " I know every dive Pop was in from the time he left the hockshop until he was killed . " " How 'd you find that out ? " " Here . " Lance pulled a folded sheet of paper from his pocket , tossed it across the desk . Carl opened it . It was a crudely sketched diagram with lines drawn , names and figures printed inexpertly ; it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Map . Eight bucks carried him a long way . I had to draw that to figure things out . Those 're the names of saloons . Even marked the time he got to each one and the time he left . " " So that 's what you were doing this afternoon . " Beginning with Sweeney 's bums , Lance went through his expedition . Carl kept his face blank . He respected Lance 's thoroughness , but he knew Lance felt no admiration for himself , expected none from him . " But after Keene 's  --  blank , " said Lance . " So Pop really did phone someone . " " Yep . Got to hand it to you , Carl . You certainly called the shot . Only thing you left out was that Pop knew the killer . . . . Want an eye-witness slant , huh ? " " I Saw the Killer , by Ben Bailey . ' " Lance grunted , returned to his desk . Carl snapped the creases from the map . He could use it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on I must know every move he makes . That was my mistake , letting him dig on his own . No more of that . From now on Lance 's energy must be replaced by indifference , his tenacity by boredom . He was the editor , Lance the reporter . The slayer of Lonely Heart would never be found , but the search would go on  --  and the editor would direct it . Let Lance be the avenger . The editor would throw him tips  --  and dissipate them ; create leads  --  and squash them . Let Lance be relentless . Let him dig up clue after clue ? and bring them in to the editor who planted them . Lance was his only danger . But there was a weapon against that danger . Carl leaned back . When I get through with him , he 'll be begging to forget a story he should never have broken .  | Twenty For six consecutive days now the front page of the Comet had been the most sensational lighthouse in U.S. journalism . The Comet was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawer of Carl 's desk was a copy of Editor &; Publisher . " . . . Only where the banner of a free press still flaps could such a journalistic phenomenon as Carl Chapman continue to exist . He could put a paper together with a pair of scissors and a footrule and still nurse it into the best-paying , hardest-hitting publication on the Atlantic seaboard . " Three days ago he had started the first of the Bible quotations  --  boxed in the lower right-hand corner of page one  --  a sixteen-inch red arrow pointing downward to it : Leaving his death for an example of a noble courage , and a memorial of virtue , not only unto young men , but unto all his nations . Maccab ees . VI , 31 . That had been for Lance 's obituary of Pop Farnsworth  --  the sloppiest writing job that had ever crossed  | Carl 's desk . But he had it set up , word for word , tear for tear , and planted it smack under the bannerline , between a two-column of Pop in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimate worldly belongings : a fedora , a meal ticket , two dollars and twentyeight cents . Madison had bleated , " Sacreligious ! " But Carl had followed it with Ben Bailey 's ghosted eye-witness story , and : A faithful witness will not lie : but a deceitful witness uttereth a lie . The Book of Proverbs.XIV , 5 . Now the Street Final carried the third arrow shooting down across a shrewdly salvaged account of Lance 's appeal to Sweeney , the Bowery grapevine , the bums , to : Faithful are the wounds of a friend . The Book of Proverbs.XX VII , 5 . Lance 's map was blown up to three columns . But there was also a center-boxed announcement . Carl chuckled . Madison must have received a copy the same time he had . At any minute , the publisher would send for him . Instead , Madison appeared in person . The splutter of typewriters increased . " Mr. Chapman ! " he bawled and stormed back to his office . Carl followed . He knew what to expect . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | " I must insist that before you gamble with my money , you inform me ! " If he only knew how safe his money is . " It 's only ten thousand , " said Carl . " Only ten thousand ? " Madison dropped into his chair . " First you offered five , now ten ! Do you intend to increase the reward for the capture of the killer day by day ? " Carl noticed a new picture on the wall : Madison and a senator . " You have nothing to worry about . The reward will never be paid . There were more than twenty-five hundred unsolved murders last year . Next year Pop and Lonely Heart will be on this year 's list . " " Hmph . Well . . . " Now he 's finished with that , thought Carl . " One more thing . . . " Madison scratched the side of his nose nervously . " It seems your name came up ti this morning at the N.P.A. " He fidgeted . " It was rather an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They even went so far as to brand you " ? he cleared his throat ? " as a fraud , a promoter , an exploiter of the achievements of others . " " That so ? " Madison rose , bounced about the office with short rubbery steps . He stuttered on ; the Newspaper Publishers Association had pointed out that the ethics of journalism were endangered by Carl Chapman 's : irreverent , blatant , cynical . Carl Chapman 's . . . He loved every offense Madison chalked up against him in the report . He pictured them trying to buck his tide , damning his copy  | as backhouse literature , his front page as a crusade for crime . " In fact , " said Madison , " Mr. Jaediker said that the Comet , under your whip , had no honest or constructive purpose ! " So Jaediker of the Chronicle had been in on the kill . When Carl was rewrite on the Chronicle he had envied Jaediker . Now . . . What other city editor had ever been the target of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what rankled them . They were rich , powerful , good businessmen with countryclub complexes , but bad newspapermen . Editors , to them , never got rich ; they got testimonials and healthy abuse . But he was different . He was a good editor and a good businessman . They would never swallow that combination . Poor Madison  --  squirming , frightened , speechless , lacking courage to stump for his own paper , editor or face . " And what did you tell them you were going to do about me and my whip ? " said Carl lightly . For the first time , Madison 's chipmunk cheeks moved to make room for a smile . " I believe they 're all envious . " Do tell . " You 'd better stand by for another kaffeeklatsch . " " What do you mean ? " " When they learn today 's figure : seven-eightythree . " Madison was an inverted exclamation point . " Seven hundred and eighty-three thousand . . . " he said , awed . " Net paid . "  | " Incredible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Beginning ? " he squeaked . " You mean you ca n't make that circulation hold ? " Carl smiled . " What 's in it for me when I reach the miracle mark ? " Madison gulped . " Impossible . " Carl waited . Madison approached him on tiptoe . " Are you in earnest ? " " How much ? " " I 'll give you " ? Madison bit his lower lip ? " ten thousand dollars . " He pondered . Carl knew he was figuring , rapidly and raggedly as he could , the ABC rating ; advertising that would double in linage and rates . Carl thought of the fat bum . " Make it twenty thousand , " he said , " and I 'll peddle a million Comets for you  --  and sell them . " Madison took a deep breath . " All right , Chapman ? it 's a deal . " On his way out , Carl said , " Put it in writing . " In the city room he saw Lance at the typewriter roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it violently and begin to write with a bitter expression on his face . Carl lit a cigar . He sent for the circulation chart and studied it carefully . A book of copy was tossed on his desk . " Get someone else to finish this , " said Lance . Carl laughed . " Still burned up ? " " I was drunk , did n't know what I was writing . No guy in his right mind would have run that obit on Pop . It was high-school stuff and you know it . "  | " On the contrary . " Carl enjoyed the vigorous rebellion . " You made every word carve its meaning deeply . " " Sure , sure , the laugh 's on me . You had a swell time letting the whole world know McCleary 's a sentimental windbag who weeps over copy in the backroom of a bar . " He threw his hands out . " Why did you have to run it verbatim ? " A copy boy darted in front of him with a wire flash . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " UP just shot this tear-jerker on the shoe clerk . " He shoved it into Lance 's hand . " Here 's your chance to redeem yourself . He has a battery of lawyers peddling alibis for him . They say he 's insane ; they 're getting the press to play that up . You paint him sane . He raped a girl , killed her . He knew what he was doing and he 's got to burn . Now quit sulking and burn him . " He relit his cigar . . . . If he could paralyze the Eagle he 'd hijack that noon crowd in Brooklyn , an easy forty thousand . There were twenty thousand waiting for him in the Bronx if he could cripple the Home Nexus . Why not a complete section for each borough  --  four pages ? And across the Hudson  --  the Journal and Hudson-Dispatch would battle his invasion , but there were some thirty thousand Jerseyites who ate up Manhattan melodrama . He phoned the president of the Lonely Hearts Club and made arrangements to open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He loved the challenge : one million roll .  | " But you yourself said you had no obvious motives , Mr. McCleary , " he heard Julie say . Lance was leaning back in his chair , juggling coffee in a leaky container . " Got one now . Pop , " he said . " But he 's not the key . Lonely Heart is . You told me " Look , forget it , will you honey ? " " But it 's beginning to show in your face . You 're losing weight , Mr. McCleary . You ca n't afford to lose weight . " " Want me to throw the towel in , huh ? " She nodded . " Nothing doing , " he said . " I 've got a personal interest that is n't going to be so easy to chill . " Carl nursed his ash . Lance , that 's what you think . . . .  | Twenty-One Lance leaned back in his chair and stared moodily at a hostile typewriter . He felt a stranger at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the biggest hoax in the Comet 's life . McCleary , you 're ruined . At twenty-eight , you 're ruined . A brilliant career as criminologist-reporter is being brought to a slow and ridiculous close . And all in a week 's time . And whose fault is it ? Carl 's  --  that 's who . No , it is n't . Quit kidding yourself , McCleary . Sure , he made you the guinea pig . But can you blame him ? Look what it did to circulation . It 's your own fault . You had to be the hero , the golden boy . You had to say Lonely Heart was murdered  --  as if anybody cared ? prove it , swear to get the killer . You had to shoot off your big mouth about Pop . You had to have hunches . So now you 're the patron saint of the Lonely Hearts Club , including a medal and a flood of useless hysterical publicity . Now you 've got the Commissioner down on your neck . Julie 's mad at you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of news phonies and Printer 's Ink comes up with : " For readers  | who like their stories as drummed-up bunko , Mr. McCleary may well constitute their best entertainment ; but for those who think otherwise , he will constitute a monumental bore . " It is n't the case of Lonely Heart any more . It 's McCleary vs. the police , press and public  --  to say nothing of the slayer . And a present from the Press Club : a small tin figure  --  tin , mind you , McCleary ? of a skinny , fig-leafed Adonis complete with halo , spreading wings , Adam 's apple and motto : " Ambassador of Suckers . " He sank lower in the chair . One week , to do this to me , one stinking little week . A nightmare beginning with that streamer : SLAYER THREATENS McCLEARY . Sure , he had raised hell about that . It had scared Julie sick , too . But what could he do ? And then that crowd of Lonely Heart Club members who had charged into the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support , protect him . And the speech he had to make , with Biddle taking pictures . Lance felt his ribs tenderly ; he could still feel the dent where the fat Swede , No. 239 , had hugged him . Two ex-pugs had turned up as his bodyguards  --  hired by Carl , with Biddle taking pictures . That son-of-a-gun , Carl . . . . " Come here , Lance , I want to show you something . " He had led Lance into Madison 's office and taken a revolver out of his pocket . Madison squealed . Lance remembered his own bright remark , " Fourth of July we got now . A new angle , Mr. Madison . " " Paid ten dollars for it in a hockshop this morning , "  | Carl said . " Ten dollars . In two seconds it 's going to spell ten thousand copies . " And he had fired through the window . Madison screamed . That was the only laugh , Madison 's screaming . Carl had picked up the phone , been connected with headquarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Comet . The killer of Lonely Heart and Pop Farnsworth just took a shot at Lance McCleary . In the publisher 's office . No , missed him . . . " And Biddle had come in with his camera and taken more pictures . Then the break , colorfully written , boldly presented : he was to meet the killer at high noon on Times Square , to show himself in the open . By that time he was hypnotized ; so he had gone to Times Square . But so had fifty million Club members , and the cops had to be called out , with Biddle taking pictures . Pictures  --  pictures . . . His face frontpaged daily and plastered on the walls week ends . " I 'm using roto for Saturday supplement , " Carl said  --  and the christening of that section took place with a full-page picture of the great McCleary . I 'm so sick of my pan I could . . . I 'm sick of this whole damn business . It 's making an old man out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I bow out ? What am I waiting for ? By God , I will  --  right now . Feeling tremendously light of soul , mind and body , he rose and walked to the city desk . And there was another picture of him , captioned : NEXT VICTIM ? That 's the topper . " Carl , I want to be yanked off this story . "  | Carl put his elbows on the arms of his chair , interlocked his fingers over his stomach . " Why ? " Lance thumped the picture angrily . " That 's why ! How long did you think I 'd take this tin-horn show on the chin ? " Carl laughed . " What have you got to kick about ? I 'm making you a personality . The Sun had O'Malley , the World had Cobb , now the Comet 's got McCleary . " " In installments ! You can write the end ' to that serial as of now . " Carl shrugged . " We 've got a world-beater . I hate to see you take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once ? " " What story ? What 've we got ? Show me what we got and I 'll pound the mill for twenty hours without a stop . But what 've we got ? Nothing !

" He 's looking at me as if he were testing me . Lance felt a twinge of panic . I got to let him know I 'm through  --  but through . " Hell , no . Call off your dogs or get yourself another Charlie McCarthy . Lonely Heart can stay lonely . I 'm washed up with her ! "  | Twenty-Two Lance was so bored , his eyeballs ached . He looked around the rectory for one  --  just one  --  congenial soul who spoke his language . He was the only outsider among the guests at Mabel 's wedding . He slunk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until he could escape . He had promised Julie to be patient until she caught the bouquet . A great laugh rang across the room . He instantly hated the cheer-bearer . Anybody who laughed like that was a false alarm . A thick hearty Irish brogue went with the laugh . He heard it closer to him . Julie pulled at his arm . " This , " she said , " is Mr. McCleary , Father . " Strong fingers closed over his own . He winced , withdrew a paralyzed hand , stared into the smiling eyes of the priest . Broad-shouldered , broad-faced , broadbeamed , the two-hundred-and-seventy pounder was bearlike , ruddy , a good inch taller than he . " Aye , " boomed Father Campion . " I knew it the minute I laid eyes on him . " Lance resented him . Most of these guys who walked around with a big smile , a hearty laugh , a glad hand ,  | were never on the level . Like that brawny con man he once interviewed . " McCleary . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know a Brian McCleary of Donaghadee whose ancestor followed the Rapderrey chief . He was courting Biddy Toole . . . Last I heard of him they were celebrating their seventh , a boy . " His eyes twinkled . Blue , strong , clear . " I 've heard a great deal of you , McCleary . " Another subscriber . . . " Read the Comet , eh ? " " No , son . " Lance scowled at the " son . " " What I heard of you was from this lass ? fair as flowers on the lea , she 's neat and complete from neck to knee . ' She tells me you 're a newspaperman . " " Yeah . " " I 've met many in your craft , McCleary , many . A great number of them are happily married . " Lance smiled inwardly . Julie was taking no chances . She must have told him to get to work on me . I 'll give him a run for his money . " Ever hear of Professor Bailey ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He 's the first sociologist who tackled the Holy Writ from a modern point of view . " " Indeed ? And how 's that ? " " He translated Good Samaritan ' as good sport ' wise virgins ' as smart girls ' ? ' laying up a treasure ' as making a pile ' ? ' repent ' as get wise to yourself ' ? " " Mr. McCleary ! " cried Julie , shocked . " Made page one with it . Called miracles the breaks . ' " Lance waited for prompt denunciation . There was none .  | The priest shrugged good-naturedly . " Some people like very low burlesque . " Julie glared at Lance indignantly . He was glad when she was called away . She threw him a sharp glance that was unmistakable : Behave yourself ! " Tell me , son , " said the priest . " What is it you have against the wedding ring ? Afraid ? " So we 're back to that . " Look , Father , instead of shilling for Julie , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed to , " What part of Ireland you from ? " " Tralee . " " My grandfather was the rambler from ? " " Clare . " " How 'd you know ? " " Sure and everybody knows of Terry McCleary , the rambler from Clare , who fought in Rathreale . He was captured and five hundred strong broke the jail door to free him . " " So it 's not a hopped-up yarn . " " Just as hopped-up as **26;649;TOOLONG . " " Oh  --  you go for baseball , Father ? " " That I do . " " The fights ? " " Aye . . . and I could tell you ? " Father Campion looked over his shoulder guiltily . " But this is n't the time or place , is it ? " Hey , I 'm beginning to like this guy . " Anything you want " I 'd only be too glad , son .

" " Maybe I 'm not the marrying kind . " " Och , McCleary ! ' T is ashamed I am of you . " " How long has she been touting you  --  I mean giving you this song-and-dance ? " grinned Lance . " One year come this All Saints ' Day . " " Why , the little ? " The priest chuckled . " McCleary , you have n't got a chance . Why do n't you set the day here and now ? " Lance gave up . " Do n't you ever get fed up marrying people ? " " Och , no . ' T is my greatest happiness . " " I mean going through the same old routine , the same words , the same responses , the same ? " " But it 's never the same , lad . Each couple is individual . " Lance was skeptical . " How many of them have you hitched up ? " " Ho  --  - Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up my records . Quite a list , son , quite a list . " " Okay , I 'll make a bet with you . You say each couple is individual . Well , you take that list  --  and I bet there wo n't be twenty-five you remember . " Suddenly , the wedding party ceased to exist . Lance did not hear them , see them . He stood in a vacuum staring at the priest . " What 's the matter ? " asked Father Campion . " I do n't know . . . What 'd I just say ? " The priest looked worried . " You were making a bet , son , " he said soothingly . " About my not remem-bering ? "  | " That 's it ! " " You 'd lose the bet , m'boy . " " Talk some more ! " prodded Lance urgently . " Why should I lose it ? " Father Campion was puzzled , but he went on .

" " Oh , then ' t would be easy . " " How far back ? " Father Campion looked at him quizzically . " What are you getting at , son ? " I 'm into something . I know it . Lance went closer to the priest . " Look , Father , if I showed you a picture of a man and woman married in the summer months of 1920 , would you know them ? " " If they were on my records . " " But that 's twenty years ! " The priest laughed . " I 'm sorry we did n't make that bet . " " Julie ! " shouted Lance . " Julie ! " She flew to his side , outraged at his causing a disturbance .

" Mr. McCleary , where are you going ? " " Back to the office . I 've got work to do . " She flushed . " But you promised ? " She was n't going to cry ? " Look , honey , you want me to be happy , do n't you ? " he pleaded hastily . " How long is it since you 've seen me happy ? " He had her there .

I did n't hear that one , thought Lance hurrying out . Cap'n Dickey was hunched over the wheel of his cab glumly enjoying the funnies . " Comet , " Lance told him , and leaned back . He had n't felt so alive in weeks . The McCleary luck was holding out , after all . He loved Julie for dragging him to the wedding , he loved Father Campion , he even loved Mabel . He took out a cigarette , forgot to light it . He was thinking furiously , happy that a dozen angles came to him , fast , that he could pick and choose .

A janitor pushed a paper-filled crate through the city room . A scrub woman near the rewrite desks was lowering herself gingerly to her knees . Carl was alone at his desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that the million mark could be reached with one more loaded run . Madison , usually timid and nervous , had been surprisingly mellow and optimistic . The only sour note had been from the business manager  --  a minor tempest because the reward for the killer had reached an outlandish sum . Carl chuckled . He had announced the final abandonment of Lonely Heart . They had asked him what substitute he would use and he had smiled coolly as if he knew . But he did not . He was faced now with the interlude in which he must find a new heroine or hero or cause to keep the Comet the readers ' delight as its seemingly uncanny prescience linked headlines with red-hot , unpredictable news . With Lonely Heart scrapped , circulation would drop . It was amazing  --  after all this time people wanted more of her . He could make  | them forget her . But he would have to plaster page one with a new play immediately . What ? He studied page two layout of the Bulldog dummy : the results of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hired by employers looking for cheap help . Not bad . . . The girls worked for little or no money , were thrown on the street when they were no longer useful . Some became prostitutes , some married  --  their own kind . The children they produced were feeble-minded . It was a good story . It had heart-punch . It was an expose . He could inveigle leading psychiatrists , trumpet a crusade for unfortunate children , initiate a ban on indiscriminate habeas corpus . But it was distasteful . Besides , morons became monotonous . Madness was good . Madness , murder , mystery . But this story  --  every other sheet would have full coverage on it by the next edition . No , he 'd have to let it go on the blind page . He stretched tired arms , linked his fingers behind his head . Ave atque vale , Lonely Heart . What a shot in the arm Lance 's idea had been . He could so easily have flared with impatience at Lance for wanting to give life again to a story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have stopped Lance once and for all , then and there . And he would have . . . except that he knew he had nothing to fear . They had stopped off at the town of Franklin to be married , had gone on , one of the many couples who passed through . How long had the ceremony taken : five minutes , ten ? No , she would never be recognized . He smiled at the scrub woman who had scraped her  | pail along the floor and was ducking apologetically for making such a noise . Poor Lance ; he had given the paper an additional twenty-thousand run ; that had been his alibi for reopening the story . But actually , Carl knew , he was burning to redeem himself and come to the end of the trail with the unmasking of the killer . Carl had turned the whole thing over to him . How Lance had strutted  --  and how he had wilted . With popular hysteria slowly stimulated , the results had been hysterical . He had watched Lance snowed under an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carl had known they would be ; stay at his desk in ten and twelve hour sessions to receive personally notes , wires , phone calls ; to interview the host of informers , tipsters , racketeers , lunatics , seers , religious fanatics , who had marched through the city room to his desk ; hammer at his typewriter with ever-increasing venom ? and nausea . Until Lance could n't take it . He was punchy with fatigue , mental , moral , physical , his face drawn , his eyes dull and circled with shadow . " Carl , I 'm getting out of this  --  for good . " " We went over this once before . You wanted it killed and I killed it . Then you come in with a brainstorm and I played ball with you . Now when we 've got the ball rolling , you want me to kill it again . " " I know , I know . But this time I 'm down for the count . Make me hunting and fishing editor . Put me in charge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pathetic , Mr. McCleary . But okay , I 'll let it peter out slowly . Meanwhile ? "  | " Nope . I 'm ditching crime . I promised Julie that if I did n't pan out on this yarn we 'd get married . That 's what I 'm going to do . I need a nice long rest . " " Well , well , well . Congratulations . In three weeks you 'll be hungry for Centre Street . " " In three weeks I 'll be nature editor leading a butterfly expedition on the Palisades ! " That had been that afternoon . Carl glanced at his watch . Rose would be getting worried . Ten to one , at this moment , Lance was very very drunk . Or had Julie decided not to take a chance and hauled him straight off to a priest . No , she 'd demand  --  and Bet ? a large wedding . I must tell Rose to start looking around for a wedding present . He heard footsteps through the city room . The janitor had gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What 's the matter ? Battle with the bride ? " " She 's no bride yet , " said Lance . " I must have walked around the block ten times before I figured out an angle . " " On what ? How to save on the ring ? " Lance did n't smile . " Did n't know you were still here . Dropped in to leave it on your desk so you 'd see it first thing in the morning . " " Something good ? " " The happy ending , " said Lance quietly . What was the matter with the boy ? It was n't like him not to shout when he had something important enough to drag him back to the office at this hour . " Well , do n't keep it a secret . What is it ? " Lance handed him a sheet of paper . Carl unfolded  | it , leaning forward to catch more light . It was a letter . He caught the signature : " Harvey A. Miller ? Justice of the Peace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the top of the letter leaped up at him : 83 Penn Avenue , Franklin , Massachusetts . 83 Penn Avenue . . . They had walked up the path to the small yellow house and banged the brass knocker twice . Miller had opened the door , a meek little man with a knob of a head and gold-rimmed spectacles . 83 Penn Avenue , Franklin , Massachusetts . Julie Allison , Religious Editor , New York Comet , New York . Dear Miss Allison : I can identify the couple in the picture you sent me accompanying your appeal for help . I performed the wedding ceremony . I am willing to cooperate and help you and the police in any way I can . Even though it 's been twenty years , I know this is the same couple because she came to me when she got in trouble and I tried to help her . It was such a sad story . Yours truly , Harvey A. Miller Justice of the Peace . The sheet made a tiny crackling sound . His hands were trembling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk . But his knuckles were white with the effort . He leaned back so that his hands could be on his lap out of sight . " What else ? " " That 's it , Carl . " Lance is n't excited . He 's quiet . Because he 's sure . He knows this is the link . I must be impatient . " Lance , it 's just another one of those letters . A comeon . " No . Not this one . " Fury pinned Carl to his chair , choked his throat . He heard his own voice , firm , unperturbable . " You 've read too many of them . You 're confused . " He tore the letter in half , dropped it into his empty wastebasket . Lance said nothing . He reached down , pulled the basket to him and lifted the pieces out . Carl 's temple began to throb . " What the hell , Lance ! " Lance fitted the letter together . " Look , Carl , this guy is n't asking for any dough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can identify them . Look at that line : She came to me when she got in trouble . ' That line 's got something . It broke me and Julie up . I was all set to walk down the aisle , when I spotted it . " Damn his persistence . " I 'm not arguing with you ? it 's late , I 'm tired , Rose is waiting for me  --  I 'm telling you : the story 's cold . I would n't even squeeze that into the blind page . " " You wo n't have type big enough to handle it , " Lance murmured . " Talking to yourself ? I just told you I scrapped it ! " Careful . My voice broke . No , he 'll think I 'm angry . That 's all right .  | " Do n't get sore . It 's not going to cost us a fortune . We can follow-up and ? " " Forget it ! " " I ca n't . " " Why not ? " Did I shout then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty bucks to me . " " What for ? " " Railroad fare . " Lance was solemn . " I wired Miller the twenty in your name to come here . "  | Twenty-Four The dawn was slow in coming . Carl caught himself willing the sun to rise . He flung an arm over his tortured eyes . I 'm out of my mind . Beside him , Rose was breathing quietly , deep in the last profound sleep before the coming of day . She did not stir . Oh , Rose , if I could only talk to you . I 'm frantic . I do n't know what to do . I 've been trying to think . All through the night , while you thought I was asleep , I 've been thinking . I hate the night ! Those are the worst times  --  the nights . . . . Miller is coming . Do you know what that means ? He 'll walk into the city room , straight to me , and point , and shout , " That man is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me ? That 's not it . He would n't recognize me . How could he ? I 've changed in twenty years , my voice , my manner . No mustache now . I 've filled out . That 's not the danger . It 's John Grant . There must be no one alive who connects John Grant with Lonely Heart . I wanted to fly there tonight . That was my first idea . But how do I know he is n't on the way down ? And if he is n't  --  whom does he live with ? How could I break in at night ?  | But he will say the names  --  Charlotte Faith and John Grant . The police will check public records ; people I have forgotten will come forward with whatever they know . And Lance . . . Rose  --  I am afraid of Lance . He is so clever , so stubborn , so painstaking . He 'll go to Worcester . He 'll take it step by step ; he 'll piece things together . He 'll never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows that John Grant is Carl Chapman . Oh , God , why did I change my name ? Just to escape her , to lose myself in the world . . . But if I had not  --  think , Rose , if I had not . . . The blackness after the first gray false dawn was fading before the sun . If he could only rise . But then he would waken Rose . There would be solicitous questions , alarm . He could only hold himself rigid and wait . . . . The mail was on his desk when he got to it . He shuffled through the envelopes , quickly . There it was , the airmail letter postmarked Franklin , Mass . It was addressed to him . It was brief . 83 Penn Avenue , Franklin , Massachusetts . Carl Chapman , City Editor , New York Comet , New York . Dear Mr. Chapman : Received the twenty dollars you sent me to come to New York . I am unable to leave my home . Shall I  | mail my information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representative come to see me ? Yours truly , Harvey A. Miller Justice of the Peace . P.S. Am enclosing the twenty dollars . My purpose in helping you is not a mercenary one . The twenty was in one bill . Carl tore the letter into shreds . He was shaking with exhilaration . He need not have feared . . . This is my chance . He ca n't come here . I 'll be that representative . I 'll get him alone . . . . It was 9:10 now . He called the airline . A plane was leaving for Boston at 9:455 . He could make it . He would arrive at 11 . It was four miles to Franklin from Boston . He paid off the cab driver and walked to Penn Avenue . Still lined with elms . It had not changed . Exactly from this corner he had driven down the street with Charlotte to the yellow house . But he was not disturbed by reminiscences . He was calm . His mind had never been more clear . He walked up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the door . He glanced up and down the street . Empty . No one saw him . He lifted the knocker , let it fall . The door was opened by a small wrinkled bundle in a wheel chair . It had a knob head and gold-rimmed spectacles . What was left of Judge Miller peered up at him .  | " Judge Miller ? " " Yes ? " " I 'm from the New York Comet . " " Oh . Come in . . . Go right into the parlor . " The judge twisted his chair expertly . The square piano was in the same corner , two miniatures on the wall above it . He had not thought of this room in twenty years , he had not been conscious of it that day ; it amazed him that he could recall every detail . . . the spinning-wheel , the collection of walking sticks , the Colonial chair , the worn sofa , the Bible on the table , the flowerless brown vase . " Sit down  --  sit down . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face him . " You 're alone ? " said Carl . The judge sighed . " All alone . Lost my wife seven years this Sunday . Did Mr. Chapman get the twenty dollars all right ? I do n't trust money in the mail . " " I 'm Chapman . " Why wait ? He 's helpless . I can get it over with quickly . " Oh  --  the boss . . . Your work must be so interesting , Mr. Chapman . I have often thought ? " " Do you mind ? ? " Carl forced himself to smile . " I have to get back to the paper . " " Yes , yes , of course . " The judge wheeled to the table . From the Bible he took the appeal and photograph that had been sent to him , Lance 's telegram . Beside the Bible was a thick ledger . He patted it . " My records . Would you like some lemonade ? Always keep a pitcher of it in the icebox . I ca n't make it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always know just how much sugar to put in it . " " No thanks ; I 'm not thirsty . Do you know the names of the couple in that picture ? " " Sure do . Got the record of their marriage right here in this book . John Grant and Charlotte Faith . Odd for a surname  --  Faith . Grant came from Worcester . She was a Provincetown girl . " How would a hoodlum attack ? Probably with one of those walking sticks . It would be simple . " So they were strangers in Franklin ? " " That 's right . " " You must have married a great number of them ? strangers , I mean . " " Oh , yes . " " But you 're sure that couple is Mr. and Mrs. John Grant . " " As sure as I 'm Harvey Miller . " " You must have a sharp memory to be able to place strangers after twenty years . " " I could n't forget her face , Mr. Chapman . She was such a pitiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cause : Robbery . . . " You say they 're in your book ? " He got up . The judge opened it , pointed to the entry . It was in July . There were other names . . . " Does anyone else know he 's John Grant ? " " Why , no . I knew you would want it to be  --  exclusive . " The judge beamed , proud of himself . I 'll use the black cane in the corner . It 's heavy ; the  | head is solid . . . . He took a step toward it . " In your first letter you mentioned that she came to you when she was in trouble . What did you mean by that ? " " Poor woman , she thought I could help her . She was almost crazy . You see , Mr. Chapman , he deserted her .

I had to find you . You never will . " She had no one to help her . She was so lonely . That 's why she came to me . . . " It was terrible , John . I was lonely . Oh , so lonely .

He could let go . The shattering roar of a passing train filled his ears . His ear drums rang . Then there was silence . . . He could hear again . He could see . A big book was on the floor . . . an overturned wheel chair . . . He stared at them in bewilderment . That 's Judge Miller dead on the floor ! He sprang back . It was he I killed ? I thought it was Charlotte . . . He was caught by terror . What happened to me ? The truth rocked him . It left him cold , turned to  | stone . His head ached . His eyes smarted . His fingers were numb . Am I . . . ? He would not admit the word . How could I be ? I am myself . I have intelligence . I can see , think , feel , hear . I realize what I have done . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But that was n't I who did it . It was n't he I killed . When had he lost that authority , that possession of himself that was Carl Chapman ? He could n't remember . All the rationalizing he had rehearsed had failed him . It was the strain I have been under , fatigue . . . they took advantage of me . . . But he knew he was excusing himself . Rage blinded him , and self-contempt . He had been betrayed by weakness , who had always despised weakness . A factory whistle hooted shrilly . A distant church clock boomed . He counted the strokes . Twelve . Noon . He had no time now . Suspicions , self-accusations , explanations  --  he would clear them later .

He dropped it on the city desk . " Everything 's in there , Carl , but the water hose and Needle Nellie . May have added a slab or two . " Carl spiked the feature . Lance loitered .

That letter from Miller had smacked of authenticity . He could recall it verbatim . But what about that twenty ? Miller must have received it . And pocketed it . Just another run-of-themine reward racketeer with a fresh slant on a stale angle . Forget it , McCleary . Just a bum guess on your part . He chewed a fingernail .

A gruff  | voice at the other end of the line made sense : " Sheriff Burt speaking . " Lance twisted his mouth . " This is Sergeant Pike , New York Police , Headquarters . " There was a gulp . He could almost see the sheriff swallow his tobacco . The gruff voice was not so gruff now . " Yeah , sergeant ? " " What about Miller ? " " Choked to death . " Lance choked on that .

" " Forget it , " snapped Carl . " We just wanted to question him . " He and Lance hung up at the same time . They stared at each other . Lance threw out his hands . " All right , all right , " he shouted , " so I did n't get an okay for the phone call . Take it out of my salary .

Hoppe Fowler , maneuvering skillfully in front of his out-of-town newspaper stand , plucked a Denver Post from the Colorado rack and neatly slapped it under a customer 's arm .  | " H'lo , Hoppe , " said Lance . Hoppe gossiped about mutual friends . Lance listened absently . " Say , I got a new protege , Mac . Young fella wants to he a reporter . Think you can fix it up for him with your boss ?

A stick on the robbery and strangulation was buried in the obituary . " He 's a great young fella , " Hoppe said , " worked on his high-school paper  --  wants to be a columnist . " Lance caught a compact boxed yarn slugged : FRANKLIN CRIME WAVE . He read it carefully : " The robbery and outrageous murder of the incapacitated Judge Harvey A.

He was strangled . How much of a fuss could a cripple in a wheel chair kick up ? Yet the sheriff said the place was all smashed up . " How about it , Mac ? " said Hoppe . " He 's only eighteen and a whiz when it comes to those big words . " " How far is Franklin from Boston , Hoppe ? D' you know ? " " ' Bout four-five miles , I think . " Lance tossed the Gazette back into the rack . " Hey , " Hoppe yelled after him , " it 's only a nickel ! "  | Twenty-Six Lance found the Franklin Spy stabled in an ancient two-story house of unrecognizable period . In front of it , surrounded by ill-kept grass , was a weather-beaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass window : MOSES BRADFORD , Editor and Proprietor . The editorial office , one room , was deserted . He knew these country papers from reading about them . Once he had even toyed with the idea of working on a small town weekly and becoming part of the oddest organization in journalism  --  the Grass Root Press . An antique flat-bed press was in the center of the floor . He had once seen a picture of just such a press in the Encyclopaedia Britannica . A roll-top desk had innumerable pigeon holes , all choked with dusty notes . Type was scattered . An order for a new font was covered with ink smudges . A big pile of advertising electrotypes was heaped near three or four sets of type cases , a proof press , some galley racks . Empty cans of printer 's ink were buried in cobwebs . A stairway led up to unimaginable regions . But what surprised him  --  it was out of place in the shop  --  was a genuine linotype machine , " Mergenthaler 1902 . " Probably  | bought on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . On the wall was a long yellow page , framed . In bold face the topline read : DOWN WITH THE STAMP ACT . He stepped closer to it . It was a page of the Franklin Spy , April 18 , 1765 ; under the headline were the words : " Doom's-Day Number . " A thrill ran down his spine . He was struck by the black border , evidence of deep mourning , with the skull and crossbones and the deep black words , " The Times Are Dreadful , Dismal , Doleful , Dolorous , and Dollarless . " Next to it was another framed page : May 3 , 1775 . Its topline : " Americans ! ? Liberty or Death ! ? Join or Die ! " " If you 're that typewriter salesman , " a voice cackled suddenly into his ear , " do n't fuss ' round me today . Do n't need no typewriter . Never use one . Get my copy out on th ' linotype . Write straight at th ' melter . " He turned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . He brushed by Lance , plopped into the ancient swivel chair in front of the roll-top desk and pushed up the cardboard visor that was tied around his head with a string . The telephone hung on a bracket . He yanked it to him . " Gil ? " he rasped into it . " Moses Bradford . Now lissen , Gil , I know you 're tryin ' your best to pay off that death notice but them thutty acres you been farmin ' since  --  Hey ? You 're sendin ' a sack of ' tatoes up today ? Oh , a'right , Gil , that 'll do . But no skimpin ' , mind . " He thrust the telephone from him and peered up  | at Lance over his glasses . " You still here ? Told you I ai n't buyin ' . " " Nobody 's trying to sell you a typewriter , Mr. Bradford . I 'm Lance McCleary of the New York Comet . " The editor grunted . Lance saw him as the printer 's salty devil who never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white cuff and studied the names , items , memos scribbled on it . Lance warmed to him . The old man crossed a name off the cuff and plunged into copy with a thick black pencil anchored to the phone by a dirty string . " Y'look like one o ' them typewriter salesmen , " he clacked . " Shucks , they been fussin ' ' round me for months . Say th ' Spy makes more spellin ' errors than any paper in th ' county . " Intrigued , Lance could think of no comment to that . The old editor needed none ; he went right on . " Heck , th ' Spy would n't be no real paper if it did n't have a few mistakes now ' n ' then . Gives our readers somethin ' to fuss over . New York paper , eh ? Well , sit down , brother , sit down . " Lance drew up a cracked leather chair . I 'll mellow him up first . " Ever hear of the Draft Riots of 1863 ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's vision , landed neatly in a handy spittoon . It was the first sign Lance had that Bradford kept a wad of tobacco in his cheek . Lance told him about Sweeney and Horace Greeley . When he was finished , Bradford lifted his head . " My father ran that story . July issue . Still got it in our  | files . Fust Associated Press dispatch we ever used . " He leaned forward , tapped Lance 's knee . " Do n't wanta call your friend Sweeney a liar , son , but in that dispatch there was nothin ' ' bout Greeley comin ' right out an ' sayin ' Save me , Johnny , save me ! ' " Lance laughed . " Guess Sweeney stretches it a little every time he tells it . " Bradford waggled his chin . " Now  --  what 's on your mind , young feller ? " " I 'd like some information . " " Humph . Why do n't y'ask th ' Gazette . Some folks think it 's th ' best paper in Franklin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the old man 's voice . " I 've been there , Mr. Bradford . The Gazette 's only ten years old  --  just a baby . " That 'll get him . " They told me you 've been putting the Spy to bed for fifty years . " " Fifty-two an ' never missed an edition . " " They said you know everything and anything there is to know about this town . " The editor 's bones creaked as he turned , studied Lance shrewdly . " What kind of story you on , young feller ? " Lance changed his mind instantly . He would not show Bradford the photo of Mr. and Mrs. Lonely Heart that he had in his pocket . Something  --  he could n't put his finger on it  --  told him not to take the old man into his confidence . The Franklin Spy might be a superannuated relic and Bradford an impotent editorialist  --  hut these cunning country editors with their tricks and tobacco juice and ancient grasp of news . . . Lance heard the danger bell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a story with another newspaperman , no matter how harmless the colleague appeared . " Human interest , " he lied casually . " Special feature on marriages . Comparing Puritans , Quakers , Ozark natives . N.Y.U. professor claims New England marriages last longer , particularly in Massachusetts . " Bradford tugged at his right ear . " Do n't believe a word of it , " he snapped . " Pulled th ' same hosstale on stilts m'self when I tried to fool th ' editor of th ' Fitchburg News . That was back in 1901 . Big story that year ? William Howard Taft became civil governor of th ' Philippines . I needed confirmation , did n't want Henderson of th ' News to know I was hep to it . Know what I told ' m ? Said I was makin ' a survey of trees . " He cackled , recalling the moment . " But do n't let it worry you none , young feller . You tell your editor you put a slick one over on old Moses Bradford an ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What d' you say to that ? " " You got me against the wall . I 'm on a yarn all right but I ca n't ? " A gnarled palm silenced him . Bradford plucked at a shaggy eyebrow , his eyes twinkling . " Yup , I know ? ca n't share stories with rival papers , eh ? " He straightened in his chair , rearranged his visor , adopted an air of executive impatience . " Let 's git on with th ' marriage assignment . " Lance produced a dozen names . " Got this list at the City Hall . Can you remember what happened to any of these couples ? " Bradford scanned the names . " Mm . . . " He shot a  | look at Lance , that said : can I remember ! " Picked ' em all in th ' twenties , did n't you ? " said the old man . " Nineteen-twenty , t'be exact . " Lance 's heart jumped . Here before him was a font of information . He had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer months of that year by Judge Miller . Now , with some luck . . . " Mr. and Mrs. Max Paine , " read off Bradford . " That one 's easy . Max 's runnin ' a drug store now in Clinton at Maple an ' Webb . Married Mehitabel Stevenson . Got himself a litter o ' kids an ' ? " " I do n't suppose you 've got pictures of them ? " blurted Lance . Too late to recall the question . It had a pinch of sarcasm in it that he had n't intended . He had once read that the shortest route to suicide is to remind a country editor that he could n't afford his own cuts . He waited for the explosion . It came . Bradford squinted , bristled , spat , swore , " Have we got pictures of ' em ? This ai n't no fortnightly rag , young feller . Know when photo-engravin ' come into bein ' ? " " No , " said Lance meekly . " 1839 , " blasted Bradford , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later Fox Talbot come out with that half-tone process . " He grumbled to himself . " Do we have pictures . . . " He bellowed . " Had ' em since 1852 ! " He spiked the copy he had slaughtered with vertical thick slashes and rose , bones creaking again . " Course we depend lots on boilerplate an ' I ai n't claimin ' we run nothin ' but zinc etchin 's  --  but we manage to come  | out with half-tones even though some folk find it hard t'believe . " He started upstairs , halted , turned . " Well ? Comin ' ? " Lance followed him humbly up into a large room . He ducked a bulb dangling from the low ceiling . Shelves , jammed with bound copies of the Spy , surrounded them . Bradford pulled out a frayed volume . " Keep ' em upstairs away from th ' damp . " He pointed to the issue dated April 15 , 1865 . Lance saw one word : assassination . " There 's th ' fust daguerreotype of Abe Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoved the book back , gripped Lance 's arm , convoyed him over bundles of the Spy , still unbound . He tapped the first volume on the shelf . " That 's when we fust saw light . " Lance , hypnotized , stared at the crudely printed numbers on the binding : 1721 . . For a moment he forgot everything . Carefully he pulled the musty birth of the Spy from its niche and opened it . A half-sheet folio , printed on only one side , with every line garbled ; its printer and publisher : Zachariah Bradford . It took him a few moments to get used to the type . He made out something about white slaves , a plea for payment of subscriptions to follow and an account of a woman who had been hanged as a witch . " . . . The Divel that visited her was just of the same Stature , Feature , and complexion with what the Histories of the Witchcrafts beyond-sea  | ascribe unto him ; hee was a wretch no taller than an ordinary Walking Staff ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tawney , or an Indian color ; hee wore a highcrowned Hat , with strait Hair ; and had one Cloven Foot . " Bradford broke the spell . " Here it is , just as I said . Max married Mehitabel . " Lance gently pushed 1721 back , joined Bradford over an opened volume . He saw a two column photo of the Max Paines in a July issue of 1920 . The screen was n't half-bad . " Lots o ' strangers elope every year , " said Bradford . " Come here t'get hitched . ' Course we do n't bother none with ' em , only run pictures of couples who live here . " He looked around for a place to spit , picked up a bundle of papers , spattered juice into a concealed cuspidor . " Too bad ' bout Judge Miller . He coulda helped you . He was robbed , choked t ' death few days ago . " Lance complimented him on the screen . Bradford softened a little . He went down the list . First he retraced his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he showed Lance their photo , the story . " See ? Nice screen on ' em too , eh , young feller ? Says Cynthia Everett . Never forget a name . " Next on the list were Mr. and Mrs. Raymond Greene . The old man raked up their past with a rich grunt . " Ray was a bad boy . Used t'read lots . Went to jail . Married Josie Aubry , French girl . . . Yup , busted right outta jail , clean smack out . " " What 'd he do ? " " Used t'beat up Josie . "  | Lance became tense . " Where is he now ? " " Du n no . They put him away in that crazy house on Lincoln Avenue in Worcester . Busted right clean smack outta there , too . " Lance had to keep his voice down . " And you do n't know where he is now ? " " Nope . " " Where 's his wife ? " " Moved ' bout ten years ago . " " Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lance studied Josie Aubry 's features . She was not Lonely Heart . Bradford went down the list , passing over the strangers to Franklin . . . Lance learned why Oliver Harndon opened a barber shop in Springfield ; that Chris Phillips was killed in a lightning storm ; how Guy Griscom found Mrs. Griscom in Chet Wilson 's arms and what happened to Wilson . At first he was amused at the way Bradford matched his memory against the names in the papers , but after nine couples he lost interest in the stories behind the stories of Franklin 's Romeos and Juliets of 1920 . " Mr. and Mrs. John Grant , " said Bradford . " Strangers . " He passed them , went on to the next couple . " Mr. and Mrs. Ralph Barker ? " He snapped his fingers . " Wait a minute , young feller , seems t'me I kinda recollect somethin ' ' bout them Grants . " " Out-of-towners , you said . " " Yup . But she come back to Franklin fer somethin ' . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an infernal hurry . Fust got ta  | remember myself . . . John Grant . " He ruminated . " John Grant . . . Charlotte . Sure . Charlotte . Desertion . " He slapped his knee with gusto . " Desertion , young feller , or I ai n't Moses Bradford . He left her high ' n ' dry . She come back to th ' only friend she had , Judge Miller . She had a picture of herself with her husband . Gave it to th ' Judge . He slipped it to me an ' I sent it to Boston . Three-column cut , young feller . Cost all of seven dollars , ninety-four cents . " He nudged Lance in the ribs . " Nice beat , eh ? None of th ' other papers had th ' desertion story  --  or th ' picture . " She came to me when she got in trouble . . . . Have I got it at last ? " Where 's John Grant now ? " " Du n no . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let me tell you somethin ' about Ralph ? Oh , here 's that cut on th ' Grants . Look at it . Right on th ' front page . How d' you like that screen , young feller ? Now , gettin ' back to Ralph . . . " Lance stared at the picture of Charlotte Faith and John Grant . There it was , on the front page of the Spy . It was the same picture he had in his pocket ; the same one she had given to Judge Miller ; the same one Bradford had sent off to Boston twenty years ago for a three-column cut ; the same one found in Lonely Heart 's suitcase . . . Bradford watched him . He was proud . " Nice balance for page one , ai n't it ? Usually run ' em two columns but that desertion called for an extra . Worth seven-ninety-four just to get an exclusive on th ' picture , eh ? "  | Lance stared at the caption under the photo of Mr. and Mrs. Lonely Heart in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes and cans tied to a rear bumper : MR . AND MRS . JOHN GRANT ( CHARLOTTE FAITH ) WHEN WEDDING BELLS RANG AND EVERYTHING WAS BLISS . . . .  | Twenty-Seven Rose had said the doctor would be there between five and six . It was five-fifty now and she had n't called . Carl could n't wait . He reached for the phone just as it rang . From the first tones of her voice he knew Tommy was better . " It 's a slight ear infection from his cold , " she said . " Dr. Weller 's just leaving . " Ear infection . Mastoid , he thought . But he was afraid to say the dread word . " Let me speak to him . " Dr. Weller 's bland voice gave him no assurance . " Look , Danny , give it to me straight , " Carl ordered . His lips were stiff ; he moistened them . " Do n't let Rose hear , but tell me . " " You parents , " the doctor laughed . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the drops for his ear . Just keep him warm and out of a draft . He can get out of bed in a couple of days . " Rose got back on the phone . " Stop worrying , darling . " He saw her as she had been that morning , bending over their son . His heart contracted with his love for  | her . He remembered little Edith , awestruck and frightened , tiptoeing out of the bedroom . " Is it contagious ? " he asked . " Keep Edith away from him . " Rose laughed . She gave him life with that laugh . " He 's showing temper again . Is n't it wonderful ? He just threw his Teddy Bear at me . I 'm so happy . " " I 'll buy him a new one . I 'll buy him ? " " No , you do n't . He 's got enough . Do n't you bring him any more toys ! " How good it was to hear her scolding him . " Try to get home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night . " He hung up . He leaned back in his chair and stretched . Prindle , glancing up , caught his eye and smiled . I must have been grinning like a fool . But Prindle does n't know how I feel . He has n't any children . He does n't know what it 's like . Twenty thousand dollars . . . The bonus was his ; he would get it . He could break the million mark . And then  --  Miami . One solid month of it . Rose and he and Edith and Tommy . This year he would teach the kids to swim . They would have no fear with him holding them . Rose looked well in a bathing suit . They would live in their suits  --  in the sun , in the peace , in the quiet . He needed the rest . Was he at the zenith of his career ? He had Manhattan 's highest paid stable of writers and deskmen without a fortune wasted on trained seals . He had jumped the value of the Comet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to the million circulation mark . Was this the top ? And if it was , could he stay there ?
