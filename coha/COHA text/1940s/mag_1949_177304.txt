A short book published only a month ago , yet already enjoying the worldly success of a third printing , contains this unworldly advice : <P> " Do everything you can to avoid the amusements and noise and the business of men . Keep as far away as you can from the places where they gather to cheat and insult one another , to exploit one another , or to mock one another with their false gestures of friendship . Do not read their newspapers if you can help it . Be glad if you can keep beyond reach of their radios <P> . . . Keep your eyes clean and your ears quiet and your mind serene . " <P> Seeds of Contemplation ( New Directions ; $3 ) is already riding to a whacking success in the high-altitude wake of an earlier book , The Seven Storey Mountain ( TIME , Oct. 11 ) , by the same young Trappist monk . Both books are the work of 34-year-old Thomas Merton , who has retired from the world to live under a monastic rule so strict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have begun to wonder whether some of the U.S. reading public , in its search for peace , subconsciously wishes it could follow him . <P> The Seven Storey Mountain is the best-selling non-fiction book in the country .

" America , " Trappist Merton has written , " is discovering the contemplative life . " British Novelist Evelyn Waugh- supports such a possibility . In a letter to Author Merton , Waugh said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world who are temperamentally suited to monastic life but have no effective vocation simply because they are ignorant of the very existence of religious life . Indeed , a thesis might be developed to show that the health of society depends on a right balance between monks and laymen-the revolution of the 14th Century took place because the monasteries were full of people ... who had no business there , and the present revolution is being made by people who ought to be in monasteries and are not . I think your book ought to prove potently suggestive to many of these . " <P> But , according to booksellers , no discernible number of those who buy The Seven Storey Mountain feel themselves called to contemplation . In Boston , where booksellers estimate that 85% of Merton 's buyers are Catholics , readers have objected that the faith he writes about is too emotional , and not sufficiently based on cold reason .
