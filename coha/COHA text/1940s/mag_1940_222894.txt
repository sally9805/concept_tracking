One of Nazi Germany 's greatest gifts to the U. S. is Professor Hans Albrecht Bethe of Cornell University . A brilliant theorist in atomic physics , modest , demure Dr. Bethe probes straight to the core of an abstruse problem , then brings to bear on that core his remarkable mathematical equipment so that the answer comes leap ing out like a weasel out of a smoked hole . Educated at Kiel , Frankfort and Munich , Hans Bethe , whose mother is Jewish , was holding a post at Munich when the Nazis came in . He left Germany in 1933 , taught and researched in England for a while , went to Cornell in 1935 . Author of five major treatises and some 50 miscellaneous articles on nuclear physics , he makes it hard for U. S. physicists and physics journals to keep up with him . Like most theoretical physicists at the height of their powers , he is young - only 33 . <P> Hans Albrecht Bethe likes skiing , economics and riding on trains , but spends most of his time mulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , daughter of a distinguished Ger man theoretical physicist exiled in Ireland . At Cornell , Dr. Bethe lives with his wife and mother in a cottage in Cayuga Heights . He does most of his work in an easy chair in the living room . Tools : a stack of reference books , a batch of paper , a slide rule , a fountain pen , a powerful brain . <P> Dr. Bethe figured out that the shape of the deuteron ( nucleus of the heavy hydrogen atom ) should not be spherical but oval like a football-which agreed with the experimental findings of Professor Isidor Isaac Rabi &; associates at Columbia . Year ago Dr. Bethe was hailed by astrophysicists for figuring out that carbon must be the stuff that enables the sun to turn fragments of hydrogen atoms into sunshine ( TIME , Feb. 27 ) . Lately he has been working on the function in the atom 's nucleus of a particle called the " mesotron , " which weighs about 200 times as much as an electron , about one-ninth as much as a proton or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will shortly be published in Physical Review . <P> In 1937 Carl David Anderson of Caltech announced the existence of an intermediate particle , apparently created about ten miles up in the air by cosmic ray impacts , and its existence was also vouched for by Street &; Stevenson of Harvard . The particle was variously called the " X-particle , " the " heavy electron " ' ( a misnomer , since it was not an electron ) , the " barytron " ( also a misnomer , because it means " heavy particle , " whereas the particle is lighter than a proton ) . A name meaning " intermediate particle " was clearly in order , and so practically all U. S. physicists now call it the " mesotron " or " meson . " <P> The binding force that holds atomic nuclei together ( and hence keeps the universe from exploding into a monstrous , formless cloud of atomic dust ) is a powerful attraction between protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus . Dr. Bethe finds that the transmitter of this force is none other than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the nucleus but to appear and disappear as needed . In other words , when a nuclear proton wants to transfer a package of energy to another proton or to a neutron , it calls into existence a mesotron , which does the job and then vanishes .
