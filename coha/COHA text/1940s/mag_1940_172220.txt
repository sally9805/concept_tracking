As piquant and pungent as paprika is the music of Bla Bartk , Hungary 's highest-browed composer . During the past fortnight , with the U. S. musical season well along in the salad course , many a concert program was well sprinkled with Bartk . Diffident , wispy , grey , Bla Bartk himself was visiting the U. S. , for the second time in his 59 years , looking unlike the way his severe works sound . <P> In Washington , at a reverent chamber-music festival , Composer Bartk at the piano collaborated with an eminent friend and compatriot , Violinist Joseph Szigeti ( pronounced zig-get'ty ) , in his First Rhapsody and Second Sonata . The same pair gave the Rhapsody a repeat performance in Manhattan . The Philadelphia Orchestra played two " Bartk Images , fairly easy on the ears . The League of Composers had scheduled an all-Bartk concert in Manhattan for this week , once again with " Bartk and Szigeti on the stage . <P> Bartk , a precise , percussive pianist , was to play pieces with titles like From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island of Bali , from his Mikrokosmos , which was published last week. * <P> Bartk Bla ( as Hungarians call him ) as a mouse-poor student roamed his native land , bending a sensitive ear to its folk songs . Among the peasants Bartk met , by purest chance , another composer with the same idea : Zoltn Kodly . The two got together , noted down several thousand melodies . Kodly drew lustier inspiration from the Hungarian soil than Bartk : his suite from the opera Hry Jnos , depicting the exploits of a mythical Magyar hero , became a concert favorite . Bartk 's mature music suggested his homeland only by a tricky complex of rhythms , dressed up in some of the sourest dissonances ever devised . <P> When Hungary went briefly Communist , in 1919 , its dissonant Government put Bartk , Kodly and its third well-known composer , academic Ernst von Dohnnyi , on musical pedestals . Enormously shy , Bartk lives in Budapest in extreme quiet with his wife and son . He has an almost inaudible voice , dislikes conversation , has one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as maestro or maitre , he replies curtly : " My name is Mr. Bartk . " Vigorously anti-Nazi , he will not allow his music , if he can help it , to be broadcast within earshot of Germany or Italy . <P> <P> *A six-volume collection of 153 piano studies , progressively graded for students : Boosey &; Hawkes , Inc.
