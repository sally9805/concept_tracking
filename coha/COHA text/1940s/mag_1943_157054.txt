On southern India 's Coromandel Coast New York Times Correspondent Herbert L. Matthews last week stumbled on one of Woodrow Wilson 's daughters. * The spit and image of her father , she lives in the French town of Pondicherry ( now occupied by De Gaullists ) . She told Mr. Matthews that she was very happy after three years as a sadhak ( follower ) of an Indian religious teacher , Sri Aurobindo . Said she : " In fact , I never felt more at home anywhere . " <P> Margaret Woodrow Wilson , now 56 , and a spinster , broke with her family 's Scotch-Irish Presbyterian traditions years ago when she stalked from church during Communion service . Flicking through catalogue cards in the New York Public Library four years ago , she came upon Sri Aurobindo 's Essays on the Gita . For no special reason she took out this 300-page commentary on India 's famous religious and philosophic poem , whose origin is lost in history . She read how " the lower in us must learn to exist for the higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist for the lower , to draw it nearer to its own altitudes . " Fascinated , she read on until the guards closed the library . Next day she was back again . <P> Aurobindo 's ashram ( a retreat for disciples of a religious leader ) is only one of many in mystic-minded India . Best known is Mohandas Gandhi 's . Much more worldly , and very pro-British is Aurobindo 's , which he set up 33 years ago . There Margaret Wilson responds to the name Dishta , meaning in Sanskrit the discovery of the divine self . <P> Cambridge-educated , 70-year-old Aurobindo keeps to his own room , appears only four times a year to his followers . If they wish advice they write him a letter . He may reply , may not . Active management of the ashram falls on a 66-year-old French woman , Madame Alfassa , known to disciples as Mother of the Universe . <P> Since the ashram can hold only a handful of followers , many of them , including Margaret Wilson , live in up-to-date houses in the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , permits her to wear American clothes , read magazines and newspapers , puff an after-dinner cigaret . When she first arrived in India she tried to be a vegetarian , but she lost so much weight that the Mother of the Universe put her back on meat . She spends most of her time trying to acquire " a state of serenity . " Each evening she goes to the ashram to spend half an hour in meditation to achieve this purpose . She finds it " extremely hard . " <P> * Woodrow Wilson 's other daughters : Jessie , who died in January 1933 , was the wife of Francis Bowes Sayre ( U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines , 1939-42 ) ; Eleanor ( " Nellie " ) , divorced wife of the late Senator William Gibbs McAdoo , now living in Los Angeles , is regional adviser of women 's activities for the Defense Savings Staff of the Treasury Department on the West Coast .
