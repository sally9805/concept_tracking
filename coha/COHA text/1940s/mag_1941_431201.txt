I n attempting to determine the reaction of man to woman , a psychologist discounts from the outset the gentle compliments that man pays to woman , just as he ignores the equally misleading derogatory remarks overheard in the privacy of men 's clubs or locker rooms . Psychologists know that man 's fundamental opinions about woman have to be derived from the secret places of the masculine mind by patient questioning or by tests with emotion-detecting apparatus . Early in my task of reducing several thousand individual male attitudes to a common denominator , it became evident that in expressing their opinion of the opposite sex men were less charitable than women . In the vast majority of cases the men characterized women as exciting . but mentally dull : irresistible , but definitely inferior , physically desirable but otherwise deplorable . Almost always there was this curious ? and to a psychologist , highly significantcontradiction : the more men were attracted by women the more they were inclined to disparage them . In all , ten thousand men have been examined in an effort to discover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite sex . In the course of the inquiry several thousand women were interviewed on the traits they believe to be characteristic of men . This preliminary report deals with some of our findings . Women ascribed to men an approximately equal number of favorable and unfavorable traits . To their own sex , they also ascribed an almost equal division ? 17 attractive characteristics ( on the average report ) to 15 undesirable . Men ascribed 25 commendable characteristics to men as against 9 bad ones : while women , they said , possess 29 unfavorable traits and only 12 favorable . Men , according to themselves , are " aggressive , brave , dependable , generous , good-natured , faithful , loyal , steady , physically courageous . " They are " emotionally stronger than women , more active , possess more initiative , are bolder , more intelligent , more creative . " They " have a better sense of values , are franker and more purposeful , more logical , more honest , and show a greater intellectual interest and concentration . " Men admitted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard privately as a commendable trait ? " sometimes egotistical , cruel , self-seeking , less subtle than women , obtuse in social affairs , and less sensitive . " The average woman , said the men . is " weak , fickle , mentally lazy , talkative , childish , petty , flighty , superficial , tricky . She lacks initiative , may be a golddigger or an excitement chaser , is less creative than a man , less intelligent , morally weaker , emotionally less stable , more pleasure-seeking , more given to lying . She is more likely to be sexually cold , has no ambition , is an exhibitionist . " As compensating feminine virtues , the men listed " submissiveness to men " ? women may disagree about listing this as a virtue ? " tenderness , sweetness , captivation , charm . ' Women are also " more pliable than men , more altruistic , more interested in children and more patient wish them . " Finally they are " subtle , sympathetic , mysterious and exciting . " In 26 that last puzzled tribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men 's curiously severe criticism of women has all the psychological earmarks of a false compensation for their susceptibility to the female sex . Though most men deny this , the average male harbors a secret feeling of inferiority because he can not keep women from exciting him . He knows that , even against his will , an alluring girl will attract him eight times out of ten . He realizes , too , that he ca n't do anything about . t , and resents the fact . Brought down to fundamentals , he feels it disparages his masculine supremacy . Most men will not admit that they are made captive emotionally by the opposite sex . But every normal man feels himself yielding , inside , to pretty girls who appeal to him . He combats their power to excite him by trying to dominate and belittle them . Calling women " silly " and " frivolous " is one of the more harmless male compensations for yielding inwardly to woman 's " mysterious , exciting quality . " The key to male psychology , as it affects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realization that men actually are on the defensive , despite external appearances . Young college men , meeting physically attractive girls in the psychological laboratory for the first time , during my experiments at Harvard , revealed consistent fear on their emotion-detector records . Outwardly they appeared bold enough , giving the girls the customary male " line . " They declared themselves eager to meet my selected female group . But inwardly they were afraid of being captivated . Realizing the contradictory nature of men 's reactions to her sex , the average woman is confronted with a personal problem . Shall she try to deal with a man 's susceptibility or with his critical attitude toward women ? Shall she concentrate on captivating him or try to live up to his opinions of what a woman ought to be ? The first alternative is by all means indicated . If a woman tries to compete with a man along what he considers his own lines of superiority , she accomplishes little . And it is true that the average woman can not compete with an average man in dominance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or business ambition . And if she can ? if she is the exception ? she receives little more than masculine resentment and disapproval . This conclusion is substantiated by men 's opinions and emotional reactions in the laboratory . A woman has two kinds of behavior to control ? the superficial and the fundamental . By superficial we mean small talk and such details of appearance , manner , and external personality as are apparent in any casual encounter with a member of the opposite sex . By fundamental we mean the type of woman she really is ? submissive , maternal , possessive , ambitious , etc . Let us consider her superficial behavior first . Many a girl is proud of the " line " which she has acquired by imitating friends or schoolmates and which she uses like stage dialogue when she goes out on dates . We tested college boys ' reactions to girls ' " lines " at Harvard , Tufts , and Columbia , and found that this standardized surface chatter evoked merely amusement and often  | contempt in masculine minds . Men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who uses it is slightly simple-minded , imitative , or is simply a flirt , who uses her " line " on an unsophisticated male . Boys are shrewder than girls imagine about sizing up female techniques . A woman 's clothes are important . Yet most women do not dress primarily to please men ; they dress to imitate and rival other women , and to please themselves . Men resent this alienation of women 's fashion affections even more than they rebel at some of the strange and , to them , fantastic costumes women wear . John Smith hates the thought that his wife is paying $15 for a silly hat just because Joyce Jones wore a new one at the women 's club opening . Smith , moreover , ca n't see much sense in the weird , erratic styles that his wife thinks are wonderfully becoming to her face and figure . There is little use trying to convert him to a woman 's way of thinking about clothes . But there is wisdom in studying John 's masculine preferences and selecting styles of which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guid:nz genius of a girl 's costume selection , he w ill take enormous pride in her appearance and will kneel quite happily at her fashion shrine . There are many more Must Nots than Musts . For instance , men react unfavorably to masculine clothes on women . They disapprove of slacks and trousers , mannish shirtwaists , ties , etc . They object to too-scanty costumes , which appeal to them only when the time , the place , and the girl suggest special privilege . Male response to make-believe bonds is invariably positive . It is part of woman 's mystery ( to men ) that she captivates by enjoying her own love captivity . Bracelets , necklaces , jeweled " dog collars , " black velvet bands crossed over the bare back or circling white arms ? these and similar effects serve women 's captivating purpose excitingly . Manners toward men are almost as 1 important as dress . Indifference to male deference , or taking a man 's gallantry for granted , is fatal . For example , a reporter in Oklahoma City performed 124 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His report was sardonic . His 1 male readers all seethed with resentment . Men are not nearly so critical of female figures as women imagine . If costume and occasion combine to create the idea of sex appeal in the masculine mind , perfection of feminine proportions or contours is far from essential . Most important of fundamental attitudes which a woman is obliged to consider is the part she will play in the love game . It is woman 's choice , always . She is endowed by nature with the emotional ability to play two parts , " love slave " or " queen . " She can play only one part at a time . It is a choice between active and passive parts , between leading the lovemaking herself or waiting for some man to attract her . A woman may pretend to submit to a man ; she may run away to make him chase her . But she must remain " mysterious . " She must excite to the point where man pursues her , pays court , promises what she demands if only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman rules , the man submits . Men are bored with the slave attitude . no matter how beautiful the woman is once she has agreed to submit . Her submissiveness may warm the masculine heart ; it may make a man paternal and generous ; it may bolster his egotism and make him expansive and condescending But it wo n't stir his pulses or hold his love interest . For this , woman must play the ruling role , the active love part . She must remain mysterious , elusive . mistress of the situation at all times , and consequently exciting . Too many women who are captivating before marriage abandon , their dominance after the honeymoon and play slave or , worse , faithful servitor to their husbands . Love life at home becomes very placid but very dull , and sooner or later the husband grows boredj While the battle is on , the man feels a conflict within and is n't happy about But once the girl wins , he is full of boyish delight and enthusiasm . But the girl , to keep him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to considered is closely related to the one discussed . It is a dangerous one though it is easy to see why so many women have recourse to it . It is the attitude of possessing a man , usually a husband , by dint of hectoring , nagging , general female nuisance power . Many won : feel that once they have captivated a many into marrying them , they have acquired a property right in the affections of the conquered male . The woman sighs ill-advised relief , thinks , in effect : " Now he ca n't get away . He 's mine , and I cam stop my wearying efforts to excite into belonging to me . " So she substitu : ; - s. in her inner mind , an attitude of vested possession for her endeavor to captivate Without exception men fiercely hate this attitude of female possessiveness . When woman asserts her right to a man 's love. , she kills it . Men resent compulsion in any form , especially an attempted compulsios of their inner feelings . Where women ate concerned , men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex must be titillated with exciting promises denied , not hell unpleasantly to the fulfillment of promises they made in excited moments now for . gotten . A girl who seeks love and happiness must go on exciting her man and never assume that she owns him or can force him in any way to love her . S.* ca n't , of course . No legislature can enact regulations that will make any woman desirable to any man . There is no obligation , moral or sentimental , that can compel a man to accept with equanimitr female ownership . There is a third fundamental attitude toward men . This is demonstrated by the girl who desires to mother the man s loves rather than captivate him . How doe ! the typical male respond to maternalism ! From our experiments it is clear that some maternalism in a woman 's genera : attitude toward the male sex is an excellent popularity insurance . Men do r. : ' . want to be treated like foolish little boys of course ; some overmaternal wives make their mothering too obvious and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing rubbers or not drinking toy much coffee . Men do n't like to be ham. : pered by a woman 's motherliness ; they ' do like to be served and protected by it Many women apparently make the very  | serious mistake , while they are young and pretty , of using sex appeal as a standby and motherly interest in a man as an emergency reinforcement . The tactics should be reversed , judging by men 's reactions . The average male , even in his most ardent moments , enjoys a bit of tenderness , of mothering . A sincerely maternal touch can seldom go astray . Men who are in a mood of depression , or preoccupied with some selfish concern that they regard as vastly more important than love , make poor subjects for captivation . But they still respond gratefully to an attractive girl 's unostentatious mothering and find her more exciting for it afterward , when the obstructive mood has passed . The general finding is : you can always mother a man , but you can not always excite him . Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , there is always the ambitious woman . She faces , apparently , a double problem : how to attract men who are her business associates and how to turn this attraction into material profit . The " attract men for self-advancement " attitude need not be predatory . Usually men understand and respect the business aims of such a woman . But her employer will grant her desire , or not , according to her dollarsand-cents value to him . Her feminine attractiveness , her smart clothes are assets : n weighing her worth . But they seldom Become personal influences so strong that Business values are forgotten . Our summation is this : a man 's reaction to the - woman 's self-seeking attitude is cold calculation . Successful men may be susceptible to feminine fascination in playtime , but not during business hours . IT IS obvious that in this preliminary report on the reaction of man to woman there is no effort or desire on the art of the investigators to justify or contemn any of man 's idiosyncrasies . Nor is Jere space to present findings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only mention are these : the horror withw hich the average male beholds hair priers , a woman 's constant discussion of er ailments , unattractive noises made ith the throat , long hair left in the ashbasin , making-up in public , heavy lipstick at kissing time , awkward position and posture , dirty shoulder straps , crooked stocking seams . Men hate to be compared by women to Cher men who are more successful . They resent the woman who ignores a question addressed directly to her . They feel embarrassed and consider the woman silly a ho always giggles , shouts , generally rakes loud noises in public places . Contrary to the beliefs of many young omen , men do not like to hear women 11 off-color stories , and never like to tear them use offensive language . Men object strenuously to patent jealousy on woman 's part ? to escape it , they will resrrt to deception . They will go anywhere t , escape nagging . They will fight the , man who spends household money for . ner than household purposes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a restaurant gives r own order to the waiter or in a taxican gives directions to the driver . Thus , briefly , this is what man thinks but woman . It might be noted that man is the only object in the world man can not help thinking about . What he thinks apparently is up to woman .  |
