Last week the balance of power and responsibility within the British Commonwealth of Nations shifted . The Dominions loomed a little larger , London a little smaller . It was a slight shift ; the bulk of the power to make war decisions and nearly all the responsibility remained in London ; but any change at all foretold greater ones to come . <P> Jack Unjaded . In Australia , before John Curtin became Prime Minister last year , his people used to call him " Jaded Jack . " Behind his gold spectacles and his mild , professorial mug he was meek enough . His best friends said that for all his wondrous vocabulary , his skill at political infighting , his long labors for Australian labor , he lacked the guts and drive of a first-class leader . He was to Australian politics what William Edgar Borah , the late Thaddeus H. Caraway and other Senate gadflies were to the U.S. : a born oppositionist who talked a great government , but seemed to shy from the job of running one . <P> Last October , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Artie the Artful " ) Fadden fell . Australia 's jumbled internal affairs , plus the growing pressures of World War II , left John Curtin little choice but to take the job or forever discredit himself . He took it . <P> He also changed . No timid jade , once the job was his , he pushed Australian industry and manpower toward all-out effort . And he began to bellow at London . <P> The theme of his bellowing was simple , understandable and dear to Aussie hearts . Australia had poured half of its effective Army ( about 170,000 men ) , an increasing flow of airmen , Bren guns , shells and other munitions into Greece , Crete , Libya , Malaya . Australia now demanded a place and a say in the British War Cabinet . <P> Dominions ' Dilemma . The War Cabinet sits in London ; it is primarily responsible to the British Parliament ; and up to now it has consisted largely of Winston Churchill ( with whom eight other members of the full British Cabinet make up the War Cabinet ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dominions-Australia , Canada , New Zealand . South Africa-are not responsible to the British Parliament . Yet under the present system the War Cabinet must , and does , bear the Empire 's burden of decision in World War II . <P> This system is partly of the Dominions ' making . For , in the British Empire 's evolution from a collection of colonies into an association of nations , the Dominions sought a maximum of independence , a minimum of responsibility to London and the Empire as a whole . Even in the midst of World War II the Dominions put autonomy first , a share in Empire affairs second . South Africa 's Jan Christiaan Smuts raised not a whisper to aid Prime Minister Curtin ; New Zealand 's Peter Fraser tended to go along with London and Winston Churchill , did as little as a near neighbor could do to support Australia . Of all the Dominions , Canada had long been the most aggressive in her demands for autonomy within the Commonwealth . Her Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King stoutly stood with Churchill , content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
