ENTENTE CORDIALE A STORY BY E. B. ASHTON MilEY were holding Jim on the Lon-I don trunk line before the broadcast . I sat in the short-wave room , hoping they 'd let me talk to him . Transatlantic calls cost the network money and are n't supposed to be used for private conversations , but I thought if Jim asked for me they 'd let me talk to him . One of the news men called me . " There 's a good husband , Marcy . They have a raid on now , but he has to know if you 're all right . " I said , " Hello , Jim . " " Hello , puppy . " His voice was far away and uneven . He always sounded much better over the air . " I got your letter , " he said . " I 'm worried . " He was worried ! " You 've got to get them over it , " he said . " I do n't know how  --  but I 'm sure you can make them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " They 're awfully pigheaded about it , " I said . " Have you seen the parents ? " " Would n't tell them even if I could , " Jim said . " Crain 's on a mine-sweeper , with a swell chance of getting blown up any minute , and Chauvel 's a prisoner . The girls are on A.R.P . Out in raids day and night . Do n't you see , Marcy ? " " Yes , Jim , I see . It 'll be all right . " " Of course it will , puppy . How 's the skipper ? She 'll fix it . " " She 's fine , " I said , and then an engineer broke in they were going to give Jim the air . I did n't stay to listen . The skipper is our daughter . Her name is Marie-Louise , but Jim has taken her sailing ever since she was three ; she 's come honestly by " Skipper . " Now she is ten , and feels superior to the boys who are her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 'd be two other children with us I had a long speech rehearsed on how we had to help the less fortunate ones out . She did n't let me make it . I let her read Jim 's letter about his two friends , the Briton on his trawler and the Frenchman who had always lived in London and was now in the Maginot  --  the letter was written when there were still Frenchmen in the Maginot  --  and about their wives . Jim wrote , " I 'm one of a pretty hardboiled crew here , Marcy , but to see these girls getting ready to take it  --  it chokes you . " As if I was n't taking it . They were with their men . No , I thought , that was unfair  --  they were n't ; but at least there was not the whole ocean between them . " They 're nice kids , " Jim wrote . " ' Entente Cordiale ' we used to call them . They 'll hate to go  --  but they know they 'll be doing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messy . You 'll be a little cramped , I guess , you and the skipper ; but it seems like the least one can do . " The skipper nodded earnestly when she got through . We would fix it . We had a wonderful time together fixing it . She went with me to all offices and committees ; we put an extra bed into Jim 's room for the boys and cleaned out the library because the skipper said you could n't expect boys to play in a girl 's playroom . She dropped most of her girl friends at school ; I suspected her of " boning up " on how to handle boys . When vacation came she wept so many tears about being away in camp when they would come that I let her stay in New York . By that time I did n't care if they never came . London was beginning to get bombed . I used to wait for Jim , by the radio . I knew the studio would call me if anything was wrong , but for the half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could breathe . I took the skipper with me when they finally came . On the pier I was nervous , but she was as cool as Jim would kc during an air raid . She hung over a fence , and people kept looking at her and smiling ; but she did n't notice them , she was too busy inspecting the decks of the ship . They were black with people , and all of them seemed to be children . They looked like a hundred thousand . I wondered how we 'd ever find them . " Do n't worry , " said the skipper . " We 've got their names . " They were Crain and Chauvel ; Victor Alastair Hall Crain and Jean-Marie Chauvel . The skipper 's problem was what she was going to call them . You could n't call a boy Victor Alastair , nor Jean-Marie either . Perhaps you could in England , but not in New York . She decided that Vic and Johnny would do . The ship was being eased alongside the pier by the tugs and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " There they are  --  look . " She was pointing at the top deck , and then I saw too . They stood next to each other , two of a mob lining the rail . How did we know them ? By the mikes of course . Each of them had a toy microphone in front of him . Jim , I thought , Jim . Then the gangplanks went up and a man began calling out names . When he reached ours and we stepped forward , he said , " Oh God , lady . There 's too damned many kids up there already , " but the skipper said , " That 's all right ; we wo n't make any fuss , " and the manhad to laugh . We found them still on the deck , still carrying the mikes . They were sitting on a coil of rope and got up when they saw us heading for them . I said , " Hello , Entente . " Funny  --  they sort of flinched . But when I looked again they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " I 'm awfully glad you 're here . " One of them was dark and the other fair , but otherwise they looked very much alike and both very British . " How do you do , Mrs. Kelly , " they said . " Say Marcy , " said the skipper . " I do . " " This is Marie-Louise , " I said quickly . " I guess Jim 's told you about her . " She sized them up and then grinned and cuffed them in the ribs . " Call me Skipper . " The boys looked surprised and a bit embarrassed . They decided to grin too . " O-kay , " said the dark one . You have to hear a Britisher say , " okay . " ft sounds queer . But the skipper did n't seem to notice . " Come on , " she said . " Let 's get off this old tub . " To her everything is an old tub except Jim 's yawl . She kept hopping from one foot on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the customs . The boys took it calmly . Their faces were frank and at the same time inscrutable . I could n't imagine what went on behind them . I had figured on their holding on to each other in a way , but they were n't doing it ; each was on his own and very British  --  the French one too . Of course he had grown up in England . Surprisingly , he was the fair one . In the car I had them both with me in front , and behind us the skipper was watching over the luggage and sticking her head through between ours . " Did you see a U-boat ? " she wanted to know . " Wish we had , " said Victor . " We had a six-incher aboard . Wish I 'd seen the chaps give one a packet . " " Not much chance for one here , " said Jean-Marie . " I shall go back before it 's over , " said Victor . " I 'm not here for good . We 're not through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was why they had flinched . I threw a glance at the skipper and found hcr looking uncertainly from one to the other ; she did n't know just yet what was at the bottom of it . I drove uptown and cast about for a topic . " Did you like the skyline ? " " Oh yes , rather , " unenthusiastically . I pointed out a few sights and felt the skipper poking me in the neck . I looked back and met a disapproving eye . A " shut up , Marcy " lay in the air , though of course it was n't said . She was right too . After a brief silence their heads began to move freely , up and down the tall buildings . " I say ? " This was Jean-Marie ; " what floor are you on ? " " Did n't Jim tell you ? " I said . " Wc have a house for the summer . It 's like in the country . " I thought they 'd be delighted . " Oh . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twentieth again , thank God , " the skipper said . It nearly floored me . She 'd never had a good word about living in town . But the boys seemed relieved . It was late when we got home , and Jessamine was in a huff . " Dinner 's gittin ' all cold . " She was the first thing that almost cracked their reserve ; later I found out why . Jessamine is pretty but pitch-black . She said , " Miz Curtis done called , ma 'm . " I laughed . The Curtises are old friends and our landlords in the summer ; they get terribly excited about the war . Sheila was fit to be tied probably . I told the boys , " You 're the big news here , you see . Let 's eat . " They thought they would have to dress . " Lawsy me , " said Jessamine . " Yo ' all jes ' go wash yo ' hands . Dis way , gen'mun . " It was a quiet dinner . The skipper slid round on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked less than usual . The boys were glad to say good-night right after dinner . I went to watch the skipper get ready for bed . She was thinking furiously . When she wiggled into her pajamas a muffled query came through , " Marcy  --  what is the matter with them ? " " I do n't know , Skipper . " " Think they 're homesick ? " " Perhaps . They 'll get over it . " If that was what she thought I was glad to let her . She frowned . " I do n't think they like each other really . But do n't worry . We 'll fix it . " I gave hcr her good-night kiss and went back to the radio and listened to the war news . They were bombing London . It took my mind off this thing that had come to us . In the morning they were up even before I was . From my bedroom window I saw them in the garden and heard the skipper telling them the names of my flowers . They looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the driveway  --  Sheila . At eight ! " Marcy is n't up yet , " the skipper announced . Sheila had n't come to see me . " I just wanted a peek at your guests . My , they 're big . Tell Marcy to bring them over for a swim , Skipper  --  will you ? " I put something on and went into the boys ' room . They were all unpacked and the room was in beautiful order . Over the French boy 's bed a piece of paper was tacked to the wall . There was something written on it . I bent down and had a look . It was three words , in English , underlined . " Remember the Dunkerque . " Sheila sat by her pool with me , chewing a grass leaf and splashing her legs in the water . Sheila has nice legs and likes to show them off , and her pool is a thing of beauty and she likes to show that off too . She had all of us over day after day , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys ' shoulders and tell them how splendidly the R.A.F. was doing and how sure we all felt here that Britain would win . Sheila spat the grass leaf out and looked thoughtful . Across the pool Roy , her husband , played badminton with the kids . " You ought to do something about Jean , " said Sheila . " He 's a lovely boy but he has a poisoned mind . " " It is n't his mind . It 's the war . " " No , no , " said Sheila . " The war has nothing to do with it . It 's propaganda . They feed it to children . " I said he could have been fed only British propaganda . " He 's lived there all his life . Jim says they were inseparable . " " Well , do n't say I did n't tell you , " Sheila said . " I wo n't . Thanks just the same . " Sheila put her shoulder straps back and yawned . " Getting chilly . I think I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was coming . I watched her going round the pool , and as soon as she took up a racket Jean-Marie dropped out of the game and came over to inc . Sheila is very good at that sort of thing . I thought , poor Sheila . She had been so embarrassed . An hour earlier at tea ( Sheila always serves tea ) one of her guests had sounded off about France " bunch of yellow rats leaving their friends in the lurch " ? and Jean-Marie had said aloud in his dark voice , " That is n't true . They left us in the lurch . And now they are kicking us when we 're down . " It was an awful moment . Nobody knew whether to laugh or what to do . And Jean got up and walked away from the table , with the skipper following him like a faithful pup , and Victor looking bland as if he had n't heard . But now they had played together , against Roy and the skipper , until Sheila edged Jean out . He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " We 'll cut in for Marie-Louise and Victor in a while . " " Oh , that 's all right . I did n't mind quitting . " He said , " You know , about this thing  --  I wo n't pop off again . " I said idly , " Forget it , Johnny , " and he said , " I 'd rather you 'd not call me that , Marcy  --  if you do n't mind . " MAGAZINE I was amused . " You 're very English , you know . " " I should hope I 'm not . " " What 's the matter with the English ? " The boy struggled a moment , and then it was as if a dam burst . " I hate them . " " Just because of those ships ? " It slipped out before I knew , but Jean-Marie was n't thinking of his note to himself . " Well , that rather topped it . But I 've always hated them . Everyone in France does . " I pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I have n't of course . I wish I had . I know though . That business with Victor and me  --  I did that for mon pofia . Silly show . " He looked at me . " Victor 's all right , you know . It 's just that he 's English . And he hates us too ; so we 're even . " A nursery feud . I asked how long this had been going on . For some time , apparently . The two fathers worked for one company and the boys had been together from their kindergarten days . At first it was just that they had n't taken to each other . But then the fathers had told them about their countries , and that they had to be friends , and the boys had tried , and liked each other less . Then in school or God knows where  --  they had picked up the uncomplimentary things that Englishmen have said about Frenchmen  --  and vice versa  --  forever . And then came the war . Victor 's father swept mines so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch for France . Then came Flanders . And then Oran . And now we had Damon and Pythias hating each other . That was how I figured it . What I heard was the incoherent story of a little boy glaring across a pool , and who was bitter and quite nasty under his polish . I could n't be bothered with nasty , squabbling little boys . I got up and stepped on the board to dive : " Well , do n't start a war here , you two . This is America . " They were so much alike it was ridic-ulous . They had the same manners and the same mannerisms , and wore the same blazers and caps and talked alike and thought alike  --  on everything else . They even had the same preferences and distastes . One thing that they could n't get used to over here was Negroes . They kept looking at Jessamine as though she were a monster . Jessamine enjoyed it , I think ; but the skipper felt bad about that too . She felt worse about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children here would , thank God . They would not talk to her about it either . It was awful for her , I thought often , angrily ; she made such an effort to be friends with both of them and not a day passed when she did n't have to take sides . I sent Jim a cable , suggesting that we find another place for them  --  or at least for one of them . I wrote it cautiously , not mentioning the real trouble , so that he would be able to show it to their families . He took his time answering , although when I heard his next broadcast I knew it was addressed to me ; there was little about bombs and a lot about people sticking to their jobs , and I knew it meant me ; I could almost sec him before me giving me a lecture . But that was no answer . I waited three days , and the third one " rather topped it . " It was Sheila again who started it . Shc said since Victor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our boat was locked up  --  Jim does n't trust me at a tiller  --  and the Curtises keep one in the Sound , a big forty-foot cruiser . It was late in the season but Sheila 's mind was made up . We drove to the club together , and Roy got the boat out and half a mile off shore he turned it over to Victor . There was not much wind and that against us , but we went all the way up to Port Jefferson on a series of tacks , and the boy handled the big boat like a veteran . He had crewed for his father , he said , in the Solent . The skipper watched him like a hawk , and ap plauded every move . She and Roy did the work ; Roy seemed to get a kick out of being ordered round his own boat by a twelve-year-old . Sheila and Jean-Marie and I lay on the planks , sunning ourselves and grunting when they made us move over . Jean did not seem to know that Victor was there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We went crawling along , close to the Long Island shore . Roy kept telling Victor how good he was . " It 's in the blood , " he said . " The English are sailors . They 've got guts . I bet no kid his age of any other country could sail a strange boat like that . " Victor grinned at the French boy . " He thinks they can . " " We 're as good as you are , " said Jean-Marie . Victor laughed . " You 're like your friends , the Jerries . " " They 're not bad , " said Jean-Marie . " Blowing the Royal Oak out of the Flow was n't at all bad . " " You frog , " said Victor . The French boy was across the deck like a cat . But Victor was ready . There was a scuffle and a splash , and no Jean-Marie . All I could do was gasp . " Victor ! " " He can swim , " the boy said calmly . Jean-Marie came up about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water out of his mouth and the hair out of his eyes it was fifty feet . He struck out after us but did n't come nearer . " We 're only making two knots , " said Roy . " He ought to do that . " The skipper had laughed at first . Now she stopped . I saw her kicking her shoes off . She swims like a fish but I had had enough of this nonsense . I said , " Stop the boat , Victor . " He looked at me . " This is n't a motor boat , you know . " I knew that much . " You can take in some sail . " " Not on my boat , he wo n't . " Roy laughed . " Let the little Nazi swim a while . Cool him off . " It was September , I thought . The water must be freezing . Jean-Marie had stopped ; he was treading water and taking his shoes off . Then he swam again  --  not after us . He made straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're an idiot , Roy . Get him . " They brought the boat round and headed Jean off . It took some time . They missed him once and had to come again . When they finally drew up with him Victor held his arm out . " Ahoy , Admiral . " Jean shook his head and kept on swimming . " Not as long as you 're in there , you ? " " Oh , rot . Do n't be a bally beetle . " We were past him and had to tack once more . This time I told him to come up at once , and he did . He was shivering , and we had no blankets to wrap him in , and he had lost his shoes . He would n't talk to Victor , and was icily polite to the rest of us . The skipper was in tears . It was as beautifully spoiled an outing as anyone could wish . His teeth were still chattering when we got home , so I put him to bed and gave him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not caught anything . I put Victor in the skipper 's bed for the night  --  in case Jean was ill and also so there would be no more fighting . I was furious at both of them and did not try to hide it . They were quite subdued . The skipper rolled over happily in my bed . " Do n't be mad at them , Marcy . They 're only kids . " Then a sigh , " But I wish Jean was n't a Nazi ! " " Did Victor say he was ? " I asked . " No . Roy . " " Roy 's a fool , " I said . " But Victor says they 're quitters . That 's true , is n't it ? " " They were defeated , " I said . " They had to quit . " " The English did n't . They 'll never quit , Victor says . And Dad said so too , on the air the other day . " " They have n't been beaten yet , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But they must n't be beaten , Marcy ! MAGAZINE Dad says if they 're beaten the Nazis can make us stop sailing in the sea . " I got up and rummaged through a drawer and found a little costume pin I had with the Stars and Stripes on it . My daughter made eyes . " Oh  --  can I keep it ? " I said , " Put it on your dress to-morrow , so you 'll know what you are . Do n't worry about the English or the French or the Nazis . As long as we have this we 've got nothing to worry about . " She handled the thing like a jewel . The awed look was for the pin , not for the flag ; but I would n't have had it any other way . I did n't want her bellicose about her country , like those two . Late that night came Jim 's cable . It was very short . " Puppy do your job . Jim . " I might have known . I sat down at my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote all night ; pages and pages and pages . I did n't hold anything back : my sleepless nights and bad dreams , when I woke up in a cold sweat after seeing Jim crushed , trapped in some house that was afire ; the skipper , the boys . I put everything down that had happened . The note over Jean 's bed , and the scene with the man at Sheila 's , and this last , from which he might have caught pneumonia as likely as not . I made it plain that this could not go any farther . It was as bad for them as it was for us . And I was n't going to sit by and watch it hurt the skipper . The skipper was Jim 's too . Perhaps their people could do something with them  --  riot take them back , but write perhaps so they would behave . I poured it all into the letter , and did n't read it over because I knew if did I would n't send it . It was a very confused and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come home . This was the letter we discussed , a week later , on the ' phone , when I said everything would be all right , and knew it would not . The day after our talk Jessamine asked for the afternoon off ; her sister was about to have a baby . I told her to take my car and be back in time to fix dinner . The skipper heard it and pestered me to let her go along . She would sit in the car while Jessamine was visiting ; she had done it before . And she wanted the boys to see Harlem , she said , and whispered to me : " Y'see , Marcy  --  they must n't be scared of colored people all the time . " Jessamine promised she would have them home before six . I was glad to let them go . There were pictures in the paper of people carried on stretchers . People who had n't taken shelter during raids . I knew Jim would n't take shelter . Perhaps once , to see what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep . But mostly he would be on roofs or in the street pursuing explosions . Not that he would have suicidal intentions , but he would want to see what went on . To Jim , death is bad but not half as bad as missing what goes on . I put the paper away and watched the clock . His broadcast was due soon but I did n't get my usual jitters . I was beyond them . If you love somebody as badly as I love Jim you can only stand so much . I turned the radio on and tried listening to a program . It was a silly one , and the studio audience was having a great time . I sat with my eyes shut and heard them tittering against the flame-lit skies of London . Station identification . Time signal . Plug for a watch . Another for a magazine . " And now for the report of James D. Kelly  --  direct from the beleaguered capital of the British Empire . Go ahead , London . " I never hear what he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as much as the censor lets him . But I do n't hear that . What I hear is a tired voice  --  no one else would know ; it still is strong and crisp  --  but I know him so well . As if I were there , I can see his eyes burning in a lined and gray and desperately tired face . " Our last alarm has been on now for five hours . There is heavy stuff coming down and the barrage is intense . I found a cab to take me to Broadcasting House , and the driver told me . . . " The human-interest story . The inevitable human-interest story . Do listeners ever think of the human-interest story behind a reporter ? " These people are brave . And they claim no credit for it . They carry on and do their jobs ; no man can do more , and they feel that no man should do less . I return you now ? " No man could do more , and he felt that no man should do less . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ! I thought of the children . They were doing their bit , Jim said , by being out of the way . They had a horrible time . So had . So had the skipper . Did it help anyone to keep them here , under one roof , hating each other ? " At the signal the time will be seven P.M. " And so it struck me that they should have been back at six . I did n't know where Jessamine had gone . There was no way for me to reach her . This was a sudden , small , private hell  --  not to be compared with that other . I did n't dare leave the ' phone . At eight I called up the police . They were nice , knew nothing , promised to look into the matter and let me know . By then a bomb would have been merciful . What had happened was not really anything . Jessamine found her sister alone with a half-hour-old baby ; and promptly forgot all about the children and the car she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she went . They had no money to ' phone and did n't want to leave the car unattended in Harlem , so they waited until the police found them . That was all . There really was nothing to it except the darkies . First it was only pickaninnies crowding round the car with the white children in it , gaping at them , making faces . That was all right with our boys . They felt like Englishmen in the colonies . The Harlem kids were n't sticking to the script though . They were n't awed . They made cracks . When the skipper talked back to them the two boys stopped her : must n't argue with " natives , " y'know . Got to keep your distance . That angered the pickaninnies . Soon  --  it was dark by then  --  bigger black boys came along , future middleweight champs of fourteen and fifteen . They heard the white chillun were snobbing their little brothers . They also heard the white boys had a funny way of talking . They thought it was an uproariously funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk Oxford English and walking with mincing steps and having a fine time . They meant no harm . But the white boys did n't know that . They sat in the car , pale and grim , and scared by the jeering black faces and white teeth and when the skipper saw them scared she did something silly . She would n't have been Jim 's daughter if she had n't . She jumped out of the car and said things you do n't say at night in Harlem , not when you 're on a side street in the middle of the block . Suddenly there was a tight ring round the car . There were about fifty of them . Those on the outside played and sang and lindy-hopped on the streets and on the sidewalks , but round the car was a wall of big ones who just grinned and would n't move . Our three held a war council . They tried blowing the horn but it did n't work  --  it only does when the key is in , and Jessamine had that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but what about the skipper ? The skipper said never mind that  --  what about the car ? They agreed on sitting tight and waiting for Jessamine . Actually of course there was no danger . The colored children had fun . But I was in Harlem with Jim after a Joe Louis fight , and heard Jim say , " They 're having fun , but I would n't want them mad at me , " and saw grown men shrink and step off the sidewalk before the celebrants . The boys did n't know Harlem . It was night and the swing fragments in the air were like drums in the jungle , and what they caught of the chatter was n't friendly . They were in my car , with the skipper , and felt responsible for both . They tried acting unconcerned , and that made the darkies angrier . There was a little one , of the white boys ' size , who kept challenging them to come out and fight him . The rest thought it was a fine idea . They set up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight , white boys ! " jean-Marie lunged for the door but Victor grabbed the handle . Jean-Marie said , " Let me out  --  I have n't got the wind up , " but Victor held on with set teeth . The colored boys raised a howl : " Let'im go ! Let'em fight ! Yeah man ! " and one big one wrenched the door open and tried to drag Jean out . He only wanted to promote the fight  --  which might have ended with everybody friends  --  but Victor leaned over and hit him in the stomach and in the jaw and pulled Jean back and slammed the door on the big one 's fingers . He got it locked , but the big fellow 's hand was bleeding . It was getting Later in the evening , and there were drunks in the crowd now . In the darkness thc " latecomers could n't see who was in the car , and when the big boy said he was hurt things began to look ugly . They had a debate about smashing the windows . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car  --  which was why the police cars missed it at first . The siege dragged on . When I picked them up at the station they were proud and happy . I had carefully powdered my face in the taxi , but the skipper noticed something anyway because the first thing she said in my arms was , " Marcy darling  --  Pin sorry . " But they beamed when the sergeant said to me , " Glad to 've met them , ma'am . They 're soldiers . " The skipper talked a blue streak on the way home , and the boys were a bit unsteady on their feet but they seemed all right . They got fidgety when the skipper mentioned them . I knew better than to ask questions . Their upper lips were in the best tradition but it was as well that the thing was over now . They asked me what was new from the war . I did n't know . I seemed to have missed Jim 's broadcast . The news I had been waiting for was not of Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skipper and the two others who also were mine to take care of . Suddenly Jim 's broadcast was not so important any more . It was simply his job . I had never thought of it that way before . I told them I had n't listened but there was news on now , and they could get it in the library . It was past their bedtime , but I saw they were too keyed up to sleep . It would let them forget the evening . There was no more need to make them forget the war . They had a job too , and it had to do with the war . I left them in the library and sat down to write another letter . I had n't begun when the skipper came out again , to say once more she was sorry . It was touching , I thought . " Little goose . You could n't help it . " " I guess I could have , " she said . She looked round first to see if the boys could hear her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all at that moment . " I knew those kids were only fooling , really . They 'd have let us through and we could have gone to the Avenue and borrowed a nickel in a drugstore and ' phoned you . " She gulped and went on bravely . " But I did n't tell them and  --  well , we just kept sitting in the car . I was n't worried about it either . I knew you 'd be more worried about us than about the old car . " I should have felt angry . " What did you do that for , Skipper ? " She thought it over . She always does things first and then thinks them over . " Well -- I guess I figured if they 'd stick it out together maybe they 're going to like each other better ? " She looked at me .
