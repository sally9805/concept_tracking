The Roman Catholic Church was willing to go halfway or better . If accepting Chinese ways and customs would help win China to Rome , then those ways and customs would be accepted . It was not a new idea . In the 17th Century , Pope Paul V gave Jesuit missionaries permission to say Mass in Chinese. * But the permission was soon withdrawn , and Pope Clement XI later forbade some of the native customs which the Jesuits had allowed converts to retain . <P> Many signs now point to the Church 's swing back . At weddings and funerals Chinese Catholics may bow to tablets bearing the names of ancestors-if the priest is sure the gesture indicates only respect and is not tinged with Confucian worship . <P> Catholic art often depicts Christ , Mary and the saints with Mongoloid features . Though priests do not teach that Christ was Chinese , the Sinofication of icons has the Church 's official blessing .

The Church is also changing its administrative complexion in China . Last week China 's first cardinal-shy , humble Thomas Tien was on his way back from Rome . He will take up residence not in Tsingtao ( his old vicariate ) or Nanking ( China 's capital ) but in Peiping . Explained a Vatican spokesman : " Peiping is the moral capital of China , essentially Chinese , least subject to Western influence . " <P> As a far more significant sign of the decline of Western influence , the Vatican raised China from a missionary field , wholly dependent upon Rome , to metropolitan status much like that of the U.S. China will be entitled to 20 archbishops ( the U.S. has 21 ) , outranking the vicars apostolic ( now bishops ) who have hitherto captained Chinese Catholicism as personal delegates of the Pope . <P> China , in the eyes of Rome , is thus no longer classed as a non-Christian country . Though only 3,300,000 ( not quite 1% ) of its people are Catholics , they outnumber Protestants 6-to-1 , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity-even in Communist territory , where a million Catholics live . <P> <P> *The Catholic Church already allows its liturgy to be said in nine languages other than Latin . Among them : Slavonic , Rumanian , Syriac , Arabic , Armenian and Gheez ( classic Ethiopic ) .
