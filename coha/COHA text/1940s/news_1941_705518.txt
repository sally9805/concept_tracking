txt Some of the closely guarded details of the stupendous 3% billion dollar tax bill which will be presented to congress on Monday by the treasury were learned . today . It has been generally known that the treasury experts expect to raise the new revenue by increasing existing tax rates , lowering exemptions , boosting surtaxes , and increasing and widening the scope of excise taxes . Among the specific proposals which , according to reliable sources , will be given to the house ways and means committee are the following : 1 . Lowering of the present $2,000 income tax exemption for married men to $1,800. 2 . Increase of the basic individual income tax rate from 4 to 6 per cent . New Surtax Proposed . X. The imposition of surtaxes on individual incomes beginning at $2,000 instead of $4,000. 4 . A return to the world war taxes on railroad tickets , life Insurance policies , and a long list of other commodities such as soft drinks , sporting goods , cameras and lenses , chewing gum , candy , firearms , , electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and motion picture film . The world war tax on life insurance was SO cents on each $1,000 of new issue ongo  --  dinary insurance and 40 per cent of the first premium on industrial insurance . Taxes on passen ? per railway travel ? fielded over OS million dollars a year. 6 . A one cent increase in the gasoline tax . More Levies on Alcohol , 6 . Increase of the present 3 per cent excise on automobiles to 5 per cent , and increases in the excises on tobacco and alcohol . 7 . ' An increase in the corporation tax from 24 to 30 per cent . An increase in the present defense tax of 10 per cent , to as high as 50 per cent will also be considered by the committee , it was reported . This tax was enacted last year in an attempt to raise enough money in five years to amortize a four billion increase in the national debt limit . Later appropriations of an additional 25 billions for the arms program minimized the defense tax as a revenue raiser . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be most severely hit will be those whose incomes range from $5,000 to $50,000 . Wage earners in this class may expect to pay at least twice what mey are giving to the govern ? ment this year , it was estimated . Mere Is Richest Field . The richest field for raising revenue lies in the $5,000 to $50,000 group , congressional experts believe . It is an area , they say , which , comparatively , is less heavily taxed now . For higher incomes , the taxes are so near the point of diminishing returns that greatly increased rates would not accomplish their objective . Taxes on the $5,0901O $50,000 group will cut more heavily into savings ' than into purchasing power . Since the treasury economists , ' apparently believe reduction of purchasing power is now a proper , if not a necessary , safeguard against inflation , increased revenue will also be sought from the $800 to $5,000 class , both by increasing rates and lowering exemptions . A majority of members of the ways and means committee are said to be against taxing incomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congress to take , this step . Opposes Sales Tax . With President ' Roosevelt flatly opposed to a general sales tax , the ad. minlstration-controled committee Is not expected to give much consideration to this revenue-raiser . A direct salary tax of 5 to 10 per cent , deducted by the employer each week in the same manner as social security taxes , remained , however , a strong possibility . The committee 's chairman , Robert L Dougliton ID. , N. CI . said ho expected that hearings on the tax bill would be long and exhaustive and predicted it would take at least two months to get the measure thru congress .
