txt To the Music Editor : Have you observed the glorious array of conducting costumery of the day ? At rehearsals some of our time beaters wear short , black , sackcloth jackets , carefully buttoned to the pants so that the jacket will not pull up and show the midriff during the conductorial contortions . One does not know whether they have just emerged from a convent or a prison . Then there are the Hollywood boys with sport shirts , short sleeves , with the shirt tails hanging out of the trousers ; very appropriate for golf . Others wear athletic sweat shirts of various hues , even bright red . A stage entrance in one of these commands quite a bit of attention from the orchestra members . The prize costume of all is wondrous to behold . It is a sort of hybrid coat and shirt , reminding one of pajamas , dungarees , the chain gang , a Chinese laundryman or a galloping Cossack . There are several vents in it , covered with metal snaps , and buttons which come right up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is Ant necessary for the wearer to have on , a shirt , collar , necktie , etc. , thus saving laundry bills . Shades of Arthur Nikisch ! I love them all .
