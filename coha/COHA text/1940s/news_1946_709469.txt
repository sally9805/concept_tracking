txt Plywood makers are being squeezed In a double-demand vise . The Government is twisting one crank and private consumers the other Both want more plywood than the industry can provide Output is restricted by a combination of factors . O.P.A. ceilings have dampened interest in production . Skilled workers still are needed . and the industry 's manufacturing capacity is far below the current huge demand . Since 1939 , producers ' filing cabinets have bulged with unfilled orders . During the war their output went to the military or for waressential uses Meantime , civilian demand was dammed-up as the industry kept up a steady barrage of promotion and advertising aimed at keeping plywood uppermost in the minds of would-be homebuilelers , farmers and businessmen planning for post-war . When Government buying slackened last fall , producers hoped to start shaving down their backlogs But new orders were so heavy they hardly nicked the fined-up volume Then . a few weeks ago , their troubles began all over again . Under its veterans housing program , the Civilian Production Administration ruled that half of all plywood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What worries the industry is the lone-term threat of competition this situation has uncorked . Producers , unable to make good their delivery promises , fear consumers will turn to light metals , plastics and other synthetics . Aluminum already is nibbling at the plywood market , Aluminum Co. of America 's officials here report the company has been selling large quantities of surplus corrugated sheets for exterior siding of warehouses . filling stations and for other commercial buildings . This aluminum sheeting costs less than plywood . For example , a n-by-S foot plywood panel . nu inch ? thick . niede for exterior user sells for ** A sheet of aluminum 21,8-by-8 feet retails for $1.25 on a carload lot basis . Two aluminum sheets roughly equal the size of one plywood panel . Their combined cost of 82 50 is 78 cents cheaper than the plywood . Also , aluminum does n't have to be painted and there is no upkeep . However . its thinness ( these sheets are less than 2/100 of an inch thick i makes it necessary to use a thin wooden surface or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controls are ended . the plywood industry hopes to battle such competition with its own metal and plastic products . U. S. Plywood Corp is reported to be experimenting with copper-surfaced plywood . In Alabama , Reynolds Metals Co. is testing new aluminum-faced plywood . Development of these products has been hastened by a new latex adhesive which firmly bonds the metal to the wood . Surfaced With Plastic Plastic-surfaced plywood already is an actuality . Developed during the war , large quantities were made for the Army Plasticplywoods are made by laying sheets of plasticimpregnated paper on the surface of the wooden panels , then , under heat and pressure . uniting the wood with the resins and other chemicals carried by the paper . Researchers at Tacoma , Wash. , are turning out plasticized panels in pastel , natural grain and transparent finishes and some with fibreglass surfaces . Sheets of plastic-plywood which are heatproof and waterproof , are being made so hard they ca n't be scratched with anything except cutting instruments . Meantime , plywood manufacturers worry about the immediate problem of bringing supply up somewhere near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . The 32 mills making up the Pacific Northwest 's Douglas Fir Plywood Association ? during the war they made 75e : - of the nation a plywood  --  this year will produce approximately 1 2 billion square feet of 37. inch plywood . That will about equal last year 's production , but will be sharply tinder the record of 1.8 billion feet in 1992 . In 1925 output was only 153 million feet . Production next year may be larger . however . Mill capacity slowly is being enlarged . For example , two new mills each capable of making 2 million feet a month soon will go into operation in Oregon . Several " probable " nevi mills are in the planning stage for northern California 's Douglas fir , Ponderosa pine end redwood forests . Raw Material Problem Lessened As anyone who has handled a piece of p I vwood knows . It is a wood " sandwich " Three thin yht , etz , of wood are glued together to form a multi-layered panel . The grains in these layers are placed at right angles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigidity than natural wood of the same thickness . The standard building grade of plywood la %-Inch thick , made of three layers . During the war the Army ordered a lot of five-ply panels %-inch thick . They were nearly al strong as pieces of steel . Making plywood Is a fairly complex process Plywood logs are called " peelers " They should be high-quality wood ? free from knots , rots and cracks - and of a nearly uniform diameter in their full length of four feet , These log cylinders are revolved againsj sharp knife which shaves off a ii. - inch layer : n a continuous strip . This moves down a long table where the wood is cured , or dried , cut Into panel shape , glued , pressed and bonded into the finished " sandwich . " The outer sides of the panel must be smooth and nearly blemish-free . These surface layers are the veneer and they require the best logs . The filler of the " sandwich " is made from wood too knotty to make veneer . - Before the war only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are much less choosey now . As a result their log supplies are less of a problem than otherwise might be expected . The Plywood Association 's president , Thomas B Malarkey , remembers " when only about 10% of any tirritier stand yielded good peeler logs Now , however , we use up to 50% and in some cases 60 ' , of the logs . Technological progress in the last four or five years can account for that . " he says . " For instance , with our new technique for patching and edge gluing we 're not so worried shout knots and other blemishes on the veneer . We cut them out and replace them . " Mr. Malarkey predicts plywood mills eventually will he able to use " anything that will peel " to make plastic-faced plywood , Chemically-impregnated pulp or paper will ! give the product a hard , shiny surface and a plywood center " It wo n't make any difference . " he says . " if the center does have knots i or cuts . The plastic will fill them in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raw material are decreasing , the prohI Ism of costs is increasing . Wages are high and certain to go higher . It 's Price Ceilings Again As with many another industry , the cost ! factor is complicated by the ceilings on selling prices Many plywood men believe output could be boosted by price increases The i industry still is skeptical of the benefits from the recent OP A adjustments which granted i about a 20y , increase in prices of 12 grades and thicknesses of so-called low-end , or loss , items . " It remains to be seen whether the ' manufacturer is able to produce at a reasonable profit . " says Mr. Malarkey . Many manufacturers believe the plywood industry . with its high production costs , will have to concentrate on markets that can afford to pay more . For example , they foresee a day when the industry wo n't make much plywood for wallboard covering because it would be too expensive for that purpose . compared with other materials . Plywood makers hope their biggest customers will be boatbuilders. manufacturers of pre-fabricated houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratiroads for lining box cars and refrigerator cars . Despite the present shortage of plywood . the industry is going ahead full tilt with its promotional campaign . Results thus far have been far beyond expectations . Many potential consumers have come to believe plywood car . be used for just about anything . War brought the material its widest usage . and introduced plywood to millions of servicemen who learned about its versatility . " Soldiers write in and beg for a few panels to fix up a restaurant . or else they want to start manufacturing some small article from plywood . " said one manufacturer " We hate like everything to have to turn them down Most complaints conic from dealers  --  the promotion program has been carried on in trade magazines - who say they have been given definite post-war promises and now are being discriminated against .

A New York sporting goods manufacturer flew here recently in search of 35 carloads of plywood for delis erj , during the next 12 months . He wanted them to made game tables . ConVinced . finally , that it was impossible to get that much plywood now , he settled for a few panels to make samples of m.hat he hopes some day to offer his dealers He has been a big plywood buyer since 1933 . " The other day . " says Mr. Devlin . " we had a call from a sign man near Los Angeles . Before the war me had convinced him that plywood was better than steel . Now he wants to buy 40 panels , and they are n't to be had . "
