Ten days after the Greeks had gone to the polls , the U.S.-British-French Mission for Observing the Greek Elections drafted a unanimous , heartening report . As a result of scientific sampling , questionnaires , intelligence supplied by 240 observers , and statistical analyses , the Mission found : <P> " The elections were , on the whole , free and fair , and the results represent a true and valid verdict of the Greek people . " <P> " 60% of the validly registered actually voted . " Other estimates varied from 50% to 75% . <P> " The 40% who did not vote included an estimated 9.3% who allegedly abstained for ' party ' reasons . " <P> If the Communist-dominated EAM and other Left groups had voted , they would have captured 20% to 25% of the new Parliament . " This would not have altered the general outcome . " <P> No significant fraud , disorder or intimidation was found . <P> Britain 's Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin beamed ; his bull-necked insistence on holding the elections , he felt , was now justified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the royalist Populist Party , led by Foreign Minister Constantin Tsaldaris . For the time being , the Populists , despite the presence in their ranks of some extremist reactionary elements , moved warily ; thousands of Greeks who had turned against the Left because of EAM terror last year might swing back if the Right disclosed a mailed fist . As Premier of a small coalition Cabinet ( Right and Center ) they chose Panayotis Poulitsas , an amiable nonpartisan.
