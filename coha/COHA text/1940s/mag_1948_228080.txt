When crusty old ( 66 ) Thomas H. Beck , board chairman of Crowell-Collier , rolled up his sleeves and went to work on Collier 's a month ago , the weekly was still making money , contrary to rumors . But Tom Beck , with a worried glance at Look ( see above ) , thought Collier 's needed a good shaking up . Last week he shook it . <P> Out from his office went a memo : " Oscar Dystel , former editor of Coronet magazine , has been appointed managing editor of Collier 's , vice in place of Joe Alex Morris , resigned . . . " When Joe Morris , who already had the bad news , saw the memo , he took a pencil , crossed out the word " resigned , " and walked out . <P> Crowell-Collier bosses were vague about the firing . Said Publisher William L. Chenery : They just thought " a different type of mind in the job would make for a stronger team . . . " Snapped Morris : " That 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second top staffer to leave recently . In March , Associate Editor Andre Fontaine was fired . Office gossip had it that he was sacrificed because of an article on the U.S. power shortage ( Our Lights Are Going Out ) that brought complaints from General Electric and power companies . Fontaine had thought that Cottier 's should have some of its old crusading spirit . The brass favored the editorial line of least resistance ( Collier 's safe- &-sane; editorials are still the spare-time work , but not always the echo , of the New York Daily News 's Reuben Maury ) . <P> New Managing Editor Dystel , 35 , got his M.A. at Harvard Business School ( 1937 ) . During the war he worked for OWI , edited the propaganda magazine U.S.A. , worked with the Army 's Psychological Warfare Branch . In his new job , he is supposed to make Collier 's step lively ; he is unlikely to step on any toes .
