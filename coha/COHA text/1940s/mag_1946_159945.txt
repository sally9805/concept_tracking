Many a youthful World War II veteran , bedeviled by a social conscience , threw up his hands in horror at the notion of joining the stuffy , conservative American Legion , trooped over to the American Veterans Committee instead . Not so one group of reform-minded Manhattan newspapermen . Last spring they organized the Duncan-Paris Post ( named for two war casualties from the staff of Yank ) . They elected left-wing Marion ( " See Here , Private " ) Hargrove as their first commander , impertinently began to heckle their Legion elders . <P> Last week the Legion , awakening to the fact that it had a group of leftists aboard , slapped the upstarts down . A New York State executive committee , denying the Duncan-Paris Post a permanent charter , charged that many of its 275 members nursed Communist sympathies , named four who had contributed to Communist publications . <P> Legion Commander Hargrove , a registered Democrat , made no bones about the Communists in his post . " You 'll find Communists in any young liberal organization these days , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about its business , said Hargrove , while it carried its claim for a charter to the Legion 's top brass and " if necessary , into the courts .
