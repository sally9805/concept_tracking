U.S. Army European Headquarters Command at Frankfurt has a curious regulation . Over the weekend officers may bring German female guests inside their barbed-wire residential compound , on condition that the Frulein leave by 8:30 Monday morning . ( After that , presumably , it constitutes fraternization . ) <P> Last week , in a letter to the Stars and Stripes , a British girl asked some embarrassing questions : " Why should German girls be allowed to live in the compound with American officers ? I know of several . . . men I consider to be rotten to the core . Why bother to have a compound when the whole thing is such a farce ? " <P> Colonel L. Curtis Tiernan , European Theater chaplain , backed up her complaint . The letter , he charged , only brought into the open the " prevalence of looseness and immorality , and the general breakdown of Army discipline in Europe . " <P> Nothing daunted , 120 officers ( as high as lieutenant colonels ) and War Department civilian employes signed in guests last Saturday night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
