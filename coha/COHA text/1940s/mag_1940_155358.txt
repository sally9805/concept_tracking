Yale 's Bulldogs ripped through the line like buffaloes . With Hindenlang cutting off tackle , Hart running the ends and Kubie pounding the centre , they piled up three touchdowns in the first half , came back in the second to score another . When the final whistle blew , Yale had swamped Lafayette , 27-to-0 , for their fifth victory this season-in the Eastern Lightweight ( 150-lb . ) Football League . <P> Yale started lightweight football ten years ago , as a sort of Bill of Rights for students who were too light for the varsity . They got some hand-me-down uniforms that had shrunk in cleaning , got Medical Student Herb Miller ( who had just hung up his cleats ) to teach them some varsity tricks , got Choate , Roxbury and other nearby prep schools to play against them . Then Princeton organized a 150-lb. team . Rutgers , Penn , Lafayette , Villanova followed . The six formed a league , * arranged a round-robin schedule . The late Foster Sanford , onetime Yale footballer and later Rutgers coach , put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winning the league championship three times . <P> Last week , as the Yale varsity wound up a disastrous season by losing to Harvard ( 28-to-0 ) , the Yale lightweights , winning all but one of their games , finished in a tie with Penn for the league championship-Yale 's second leg on the seven-year-old Sanford Trophy . Princeton , with two-and-a-half legs on the cup , finished fifth . Lafayette , undefeated and untied in varsity play this year , failed to win a game . <P> Basically , 150-lb. football is just like varsity football . Its offensive formations usually run out of a single wing ( Yale sometimes uses a double wing ) . Defensively , the Fifties use all the standard lineups : five , six , seven-man , looping , overshifted lines . But , since all players weigh about the same ( no more than 154 Ib. the day of the game ) , there is a premium on precision , speed , timing . A lightweight eleven 's downfield blocking is often something even the pros might be proud of . Since Fifties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more daring , more spectacular . Not unusual is a series of four laterals on one play . <P> Though only ten years old , lightweight football already has its Immortals : Yale 's Doug Northrop , who punted 84 yards during the 1934 game with Penn ( longest punt on record until Al Braga of the University of San Francisco punted 89 yards in a varsity game three years ago ) ; Rutgers ' Pomp Chandler , twinkle-toed Negro who led the little Scarlet through three undefeated seasons ; Yale 's Dave Boies , who in 1936 , before a crowd of 12,000 , kicked a last-minute field goal that handed Rutgers its first defeat in four years ; Princeton 's Buster Bedford , who scored ten touchdowns during the Tigers ' all-winning 1938 season . <P> Football 's Fifties have no prescribed training rules , no pre-season practice . Their coaches are usually borrowed from basketball or track . Ken Loeffler , Yale coach for the past five years , was hired originally because of the basketball teams he turned out at Geneva College . His record with Yale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bulldog football teams have lost only six games in five years . <P> *Later expanded to include Cornell.
