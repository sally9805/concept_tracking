txt Democrats quietly but grimly raised today an all but impenetrable barrier against the efforts of Senate Republicans to force an investigation of Attorney General ' Tom C. Clark . The inquiry was being demanded , with the support of the Republican party leadership , by Senator James P. Kern of Missouri on the claim that the Attorney General " whitewashed " a Federal inquiry into alleged voting frauds in Kansas City in the 1946 congressional primary . To all the accusations the Democrats have been retorting " Politics ! " For the third successive day the " pending business " of the Senate when it met at noon was this controversy , but today again Republicans were unable to bring it to any point of decision . Not only other pressing business intervened , but also a repeated Democratic disinclination to take up the Kem resolution . The strongest prospect tonight was that the Republicans would not be able even to get a vote on the issue before the scheduled adjournment of Congress on July 26 . The Democrats in the Senate , it was learned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vote there . In the House , to which it had been reported earlier the Republican leaders would turn if they were halted in the Senate , the position was equally difficult for the Republican plan . In quarters which would have a vast influence on such a matter in the House , it was disclosed flatly that there was no present intention to pick up the struggle from the Senate . It was said authoritatively that this reluctance would not be al ' tered under any circumstances short of the most powerful direct appeals from Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio , the Republican leader in the Senate , and others - among the top Republican command of the country . And even then , it was said , there would be no assurance of House action . Apart from this , House Democrats were said to be eyeing with utmost belligerence any Republican efforts to shift the Clark controversy to the lower chamber . Heavy Opposition Set They were prepared , it was made , clear , to put in the heaviest action against any such effort and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they could try to bring up such a matter only at their peril so far as other pressing legislative business was concerned . It was privately conceded even in some Republican quarters that such a determined Democratic stand would , in every likelihood , break Senator Kem 's campaign , for this session at least . Some indication that the Republican leaders in the Senate were taking a doubtful view of the prospects came earlier in the day after a meeting of the Senate Republican Policy Committee . Although Senator Wallace P. White Jr. , of Maine , the Republican floor leader , had announced last night that the Senate would be held in session all day today and into the night on the Kern resolution , this tactic was abandoned at once this morning after the policy meeting . Senator Kenneth S. Wherry of Nebraska , - the Republican whip , announced then that there would be no night session tonight , or tomorrow night , although he did lay on a long schedule-11 A. M. to 7 P. M. ? for tomorrow . , During the day the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor came from Senator Arthur Capper , Republican , of Kansas . Wryly observing that he was anxious to avoid any contribution to " a filibuster against an action I would like to see taken , " Mr. Capper held his speech to 200 words . He urged the Senate to " remain in continuous session " until the 1Kern resolution was disposed of ; asserted that there was no justification of " political partisanship " 1 in the matter , and declared that in I I his long service in the Senate he himself had voted for every proposed election frauds inquiry , regardless of the party involved . " I see no reason , " he added , " why the Senate should be barred from trying to clean up a pretty sorry mess in Kansas City , Mo. , just because some persons high in public life might be involved . " The election in connection with which Senator Kern demanded an inquiry of the Attorney General 's actions was the 1946 Democratic primary in the Fifth Congressional District of Missouri . In the primary Enos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slaughter , but was himself defeated in the general election .
