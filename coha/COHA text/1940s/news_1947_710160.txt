txt A giant industry which was supposed to die is doing very nicely . How long can such bubbling health continue ? The Northwest-a aluminum plants were built to fight a war . To many experts it did n't seem like they could stack up against peat-time competition . " Too far from the major Eastern markets " was the general But this year more aluminum will come out of this section than any other part of the country . Private and Government-owned plants are scheduled to produce 627 million pounds of the light metal ; that 's 40% of expectod national production of 1,400 million pounds . What 's the explanation ? the unprecedented demand for aluminum The metal is wanted for a host of new products  --  clothespins , rakes , tools and awnings . Railroad car and bus builders are screaming for it . It 's needed for new homes . The Aluminum Company of America alone plans to produce 2 million aluminum window frames this year . Steel Starvation One ReAson The steep shortage is feeding the demandFor example , aluminum has proved it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roofing and building facings . But the lack of corrugated steel , widely preferred before the war , is resulting in much greater use of the light metal in these products . Peacetime manufacture of aluminum in the Northwest involves a remarkable kind of economics . Raw materials are shipped here from half-way and more across the country . This was true during the war , too . But then the manufactured aluminum found a. ready market : The war-boomed West Coast aircraft industry . Now . much of the light metal has to be transported back East . That 's where most of the plants which do the final processing ; are located . Just . how long these economics can be practiced when and if aluminum demand lessens is the big question here . ILs answer is important to giant Alcoa and the other two operators of the Northwest aluminum plants : Reynolds Metal Co. and Henry J. Kaiser 's Permanente Metals Corp . It 's important , too . to the Government which owns most of the $136 million investment in the industry . And . finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacture now claims nearly half the entire power output of the Government 's giant Grand Coulee and Bonneville dams . What 's left over of these dams productive capacity of 600,000 kilowatts , says one private power company official , is n't enough " to take care of new residential customers . " As a result , no new industries which require great amounts of electric energy can be brought into this territory now . " Battle of The Bulge " The answer to the longevity of the current high demand for aluminum is largely related to steel production . No one doubts that aluminum is going into many products formerly made from steel . But there is a big argument about just how many of these products will become the monopoly of steel once again when that metal turns abundant . A building contractor describes many of the current purchasers of sheet aluminum as " distressed customers . " He says that these customers would have preferred to buy corrugated steel for such purposes as the roofs and sides of buildings . But , he declares , the steel was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building finished with sheet aluminum , and you usually find a dented building , particularly the lower parts . Workmen can dent it easily with lumber and pretty soon the building looks like it has been through the ' Battle of the Bulge ' . " But aluminum people are quick to defend their metal ( a 13-story office building under construction in downtown Portland will be faced entirely with aluminum ) . Says a recent Sears-Roebuck advertisement on aluminum roofing : " Does not rust . No painting . Permanent-attractive . Here 's a roofing that requires no upkeep . . " C. Sanford Thayer , manager of the Alcoa plant at Vancouver , Wash .. says aluminum proved to its many wartime handlers that it was tough as well as light . Acids Ed Appel , Reynolds Metals ' top official in this area : " There is a tremendous market for aluminum and it should be good for a long , long time . War accelerated its uses and we are in a new stage of development in the industry . " Seven Plants Accounted For The Northwest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aluminum . A sixth plant is an aluminum rolling mill , which converts pig into plate , sheet and strip . The seventh is the Government 's $5 million " alumina-from-clay " plant at Salem , Ore . Alumina is the raw material for pig . All are busily engaged in aluminum production except one of the private plants which is being rehabilitated and the Salem factory . It 's gone over to the manufacture , of fertilizer . The seven plants , located in Washington and Oregon , stack up this way ? Privately-owned : Alcoa 's $20 million plant at Vancouver , Wash , built in 1933 and the first aluminum manufacturing enterprise started in the Northwest ; annual capacity : 165 million pounds . Reynolds Metals $8 million plant at Longview ; capacity : 62 million pounds . The Permanente Metal 's plant at Tacoma ; capacity : 40 million pounds . This Factory was built by the Government for $6 million in 1942 and was bought by Permanente for $3 million , of which $500.000 was paid down . It is currently idle while it undergoes $1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The $22 million Mead plant in Spokane . Wash. : capacity : 216 million pounds : lessee : Permanente . The $19 million Troutdale plant : capacity : 144 million pounds , lessee : Reynolds Metals . The $48 million Trentwood rolling mill at Spokane ; capacity ; 280 million pounds of plate , sheet and strip , lessee : Permanente . Experiments in making alumina from local clay at the Government 's Salem plant were abandoned last summer as too costly . The factory has been re-equipped and its lessee . Columbia Metals Corp . is manufacturing ammonium sulphate fertilizer there The Price Problem Price-wise there is no difference between pig aluminum produced here and in other major manufacturing centers : the East and the South . It sells for 14 cents a pound all around . This price identity has brought some complaints from Northwest companies which use aluminum . A Portland manufacturer who is among the complainants comments . " And so many promises were made about cheap aluminum " As poser costs stack up , the Northwest has nothing exceptional to offer aluminum producers . Alcoa. for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wash . plant is 1 9 cents per pound of aluminum . This is ! slightly under the 2 1 cents per pound at I Alcoa , Tenn , where the company uses both its own and Tennessee Valley Authority energy . But it 's above the 1 t cents and 1.6 cents which Alcoa pays at its Niagara Falls and Messina , N. Y. , plants . respectively . Thus , any real reduction in the manufacturing price of aluminum under that of the East and South will probably have to be sought in other directions than power It 's belie  --  ed Alcoa is seeking the answer by locating a nearer source of material . Alcoa now transports from Mobile . Ala. and East St. Louis . Ill . the alumina from which it manufactures aluminum at its Vancouver plan Reduction plants in those distant , cities make the alumina from the raw bauxite . Average freight rates for a ton of alumina shipped from the East to the Northwest ere SS S I. It takes two tons of alumina to produce one ton of pig aluminum . Hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ton of the pig is $17.22 On top of this comes the expense of transporting the aluminum back East to the centers which do further processing . Alma 's Search for Ore Alcoa has leased thousands of acres in Oregon 's NVashingtnn and Columbia counties near Portland . This land is reported to be rich in an ore called laterite . Geologists describe laterite as a high-iron content bauxite . Alcoa has worked out a reduction method for . this ore . Says Alcoa Manager C. S Thayer : ' While laterite is much lower in alumina than esen the lowest grade bauxite used in Arkansas during the war , the Oregon material has a high percentage of iron oxide . " Thus . Mr. Thayer indicates , Alcoa hopes to balance the high cost of the alumina obtained from this ore by producing " a marketable iron " as a by-product . More than 1,000 tons of laterite have been shipped by Alcoa to a pilot plant at East St. Louis , where the best reduction method is being determined . Once this is accomplished , it is understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aluminum manufacturing property Alcoa will continue to ship the bulk of its pig manufactured at Vancouver to Eastern fabricating plants in such cities as East Detroit . Mich . Lafayette , Ind . and Edgewater , N. J. But the expense of transporting raw material from the East will be elimulated if the laterite experiment works out . This might serve to reduce the price of the pig aluminum and . consequently , of the finished product as well Kaiser ? % quest Kaiser 's Permanente Metals Corp . has its engineers drilling for bauxite in Surinam . Dutch Guiana . in South America . Permanente now gets alumina from its Baton Rouge , La . reduction plant . Some leaders believe eventually much hauxite will ? onle to the Northwest from large deposits in the Dutch East Indies .
