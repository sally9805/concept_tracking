The Army 's Surgeon General , James C. Magee , back last week from an inspection trip in Africa , described a triumph of U.S. medicine . " North Africa , " said he , " is not a well-sanitated place . For instance , within one small walled native town , we found plague , leprosy , smallpox , typhoid , typhus , two or three kinds of dysentery and just about all the skin diseases known . " ( " Some parts of the world , " he added , " just refuse to regard venereal disease as a problem . " ) But in spite of these conditions , in spite of long , hard-working days , dampness and mud , Army sickness rate in Africa is only 1%. * <P> The Army has accomplished this by several means . It keeps the troops out of native quarters . It keeps malaria satisfactorily at bay with atabrine and quinine ( TIME , Feb. 1 ) . Typhus is avoided by systematic delousing of men . ( Details of the Army 's latest clothing decontamination method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medical Corps secret . ) Without much help from local African authorities , the Army fights venereal disease by exhortation , prophylaxis and the latest therapies . <P> <P> * This can not be fairly compared to the 3% rate at home because soldiers in war theaters do not report minor illnesses for which soldiers at home are sent to bed .
