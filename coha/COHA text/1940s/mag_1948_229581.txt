Ex-Secretary of State Cordell Hull last week laid his mellowed memoirs on the tomb of the New Deal . Although the wreath was appropriately floral , there were ( also appropriately ) some thorns among the roses . Excerpts from his good , grey story , written* at Bethesda Naval Hospital and soon to be published in two volumes by Macmillan , began appearing last week in the good , grey New York Times . <P> No Errand Boy . Gravely , 76-year-old Cordell Hull sought to correct the impression that he was little more than an errand boy in a State Department actually bossed by Franklin Roosevelt . Between Roosevelt and him there was never an " unfriendly word , " although " a few emphatic differences rose between us which we thrashed out bluntly but in a friendly spirit . " Hull had to make his own decisions " in the majority of cases . " He recommended the moral embargo against Italy during the Ethiopian war . He worked out the details with the British on the overage destroyer deal . <P> Neither Roosevelt nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But they learned fast . <P> Too Fast , Too Far . The only basic differences between Hull and Roosevelt cropped up in domestic matters . Hull remembered those differences with a wince . " I was frankly glad not to be invited into the White House groups where so often the ' liberal ' game was played on an extreme basis . " He once said to Roosevelt : " I ca n't help but feel that you 're going too fast and too far with certain of your domestic reforms . " <P> With the same alacrity shown by ex-Treasury Secretary Morgenthau , Hull hastened to divorce himself from any part in the Roosevelt spending program : " I stood for a fixed policy of balanced budgets . " <P> He recalled : " The President always heard me through with entire respect . Then he continued eating or smoking , without saying anything . After a few seconds of silence he cr I mentioned something else and the conversation veered in another direction . " <P> When the going got too tough , the Secretary stole away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putt around a golf green but croquet was his favorite relaxation . " It may seem namby-pamby but it is really a very scientific game , " he wrote . He became very expert and once beat the champion " of a certain section of the United States . " But in his last years at State , he had to give up the game . " My doctor required me to taper off , which probably proves that it is more strenuous than most people think . " <P> <P> * In collaboration with Andrue Berding , former Associated Press correspondent at the State Department .
