THE FIRST AMERICANS IN NORTH AFRICA - Louis B. Wright &; Julia H. MacLeod - Princeton University Press ( $3 ) . <P> " Can any man believe that this elevated brute ... sitting on his rump on a cushion of embroidered velvet ... has seven kings of Europe , two republics , and a continent tributary to him when his whole naval force is not equal to two line-of-battle ships ? " <P> The elevated brute was the Dey of Algiers and the man who asked this stictly rhetorical quextion was William Eaton , first U.S. Consul to Tunis . Rarely in history has any man been so frustrated as that tempestuous , square-jawed young New Englander . <P> For centuriesthe fat greasy rulers of Algiers , Tunis , Morocco and Tripoli had maintained s gang rule over all Mediterranean shipping . Rather than provoke these fierce Barbary pirates the maritime nations of Europe patiently paid protection money in a steady tribute of jewels , gold , ships and gunpowder . When the youthful U.S. , short of ships and cast loose from the protection of the British Navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Adams sent young William Eaton to supervise the job . <P> Consul Eaton , soon disgusted by the greed and eternal haggling of the Tripolitan Pasha , decided that appeasment did not pay . Instead he set up a howl for naval action . If he had his way , he stormed , the U.S. would fit out a fleet , sink every corsair on sight and " let the Pashas wreak their vengeance on the consuls- if they pleased , eat them . " <P> Liberally spicing their narrative with Eaton 's peppery comments . Historian Louis Wright and Librarian Julia MacLeod ( both of Huntington Library , San Marino , Calif. ) have written a brisk account of the first puny U.S. efforts to carry a big stick in world affairs . During the six rollicking years that he carried that stick , Consul Eaton had enough trouble , and made enough comments on it , to build up quite a legend . <P> Seraglio in the Harbor . Contemptuous of the Consul 's two-bit nation , Tripoli 's Pasha cared little whether the U.S. fulfilled his increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filling his coffers and slave pens as full as tribute would . Eventually , in a petulant burst of impatience , he declared war by chopping down the flagpole at the consulate . <P> The U.S. fleet that sailed in response to this outrage , at Eaton 's demand , did little to raise U.S. prestige . From what was left of a Navy economically scrapped by Adams , six small ships sailed against Barbary . <P> To while away the long sea hours , Commodore Richard Valentine Morris brought along his wife , baby , and Negro maid Sal ; to keep his crew happy , he let them bring their wives too . This domestically blissful squadron cruised leisurely about the Mediterranean , then settled down to a blockade of Tripoli . During the siege a seaman 's wife on the flagship Chesapeake bore a child in the forecastle . When the Commodore 's wife began expecting , Morris lifted the blockade and sailed off to Malta so that she could be delivered in style . <P> " I would recommend to the Government of the United States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to station a company of comedians and a seraglio before the enemy 's port .
