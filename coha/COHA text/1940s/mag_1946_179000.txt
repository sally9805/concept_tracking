In Hollywood , where every sleeve holds a concealed dagger , producers were more than usually wary . On top of processing scads of mystery pictures and several hush-hush mellers about the OSS , Hollywood had a cloak- &-dagger; drama of its own : Who will produce the first big atom-bomb picture ? <P> Chief rivals are Paramount and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer . According to Hollywood gossips , they are infiltrating each other 's lots with company spies disguised as extras . Following standard practice , Paramount has already surmounted the first production hurdle : picking and discarding various titles . The chosen one : Top Secret . It is no top secret that the picture will be masterminded by cinema wizard Hal Wallis ( Casablanca , Love Letters ) , whose signature is pace and palaver . Estimated cost : $2,000,000 . <P> Metro , too , is prepared to shoot the works on its more ominously titled The Beginning or the End . Cast for the leads : Clark Gable , Spencer Tracy . Producer : heavy , slow-talking Sam Marx , * who , in Hollywood 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directing a collie dog through Lassie Come Home and Son of Lassie . <P> The battle has progressed far beyond Hollywood . Both studios have sent secret missions to Washington , both have consulted with famed atom-expert Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer . Each has enough " technical advisers " to set up a Hollywood branch of the Nuclear Physicists ' Club , although there is little new which the scientists can disclose . Tension has mounted : customers at Mike Romanoff 's posh eatery now talk in whispers instead of in the regulation Hollywood yell . Dark diplomacy is hinted at . <P> Interloper . Meanwhile , coony oldtime Producer Sol Wurtzel , formerly 20th Century-Fox 's nabob of the Bs , had an idea . Long ago he realized that what he lacked in high budgets and Washington connections could be made up in speed . He has already completed , for Fox release , a Nazi spy chase called Rendezvous 24 . While not strictly an atom-bomb picture , it deals with German scientists who tried to blow up Paris by radio-controlled atomic energy . It may conceivably pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> But neither Paramount nor Metro professes much alarm at this crude trespass . Paramount confidently says that Hal Wallis has the " official " story of the atom bomb locked safely in his desk . Says Metro : " SammyMarx has the atom sewed up tight .
