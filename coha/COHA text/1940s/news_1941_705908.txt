txt WASHINGTON , Sept. 22 ? A House subcommittee , beginning tomorrow to examine the President 's new lend-lease budget , will doubtless show some critical interest in the record made under the first lend-lease appropriation of six months ago . This Mr. Roosevelt recently summarized in a message to Congress . The result was a barrage of adverse comment . But if the lend-lease administrators explain more clearly to Congress the exact state of their case they should get a better press . The message reported that of an appropriation of $7 billions , and allocations of over $6 billions , in the six months from the time the money was authorized , less than $400 millions was spent for goods acquired ready-made or produced and only $190 millions of this was exported to Great Britain , China and other lend-lease points . Of that , materiel was represented by but $72 millions , or 1% of the total appropriation , the remaining 2% being food and other non-military supplies . On the face of it , that is a depressing record . But in this correspondent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the lend-lease unit individually . When the agency was set up by Congress , about six months before the President 's last report , there were three production pools from which to siphon the goods it was authorized to manufacture : the plants engaged in carrying out the British ( and pre-Vichy French ) contracts ; the plants engaged in filling the orders of the Army and the Navy ; and the new plants in process of construction . The first two were occupied with the work in hand , and the third was unready . Since the character of the bulk of lend-lease orders ( four-engine bombers , field guns , etc. ) is such that they could not be produced in six months , even if there had been available the plants to turn them out , they naturally have been neither manufactured nor sent . Improvement in August For long-term orders , therefore , the lend-lease agency was put in a waiting position and its activity was greatly confined to buying available supplies " off the shelf " and elsewhere . For several months this meant that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquisition of food was limited by the nature of the supplies , their growing seasons and the various marketing agreements other government agencies have instituted . But by August the lend-lease department was able to acquire a sufficient quantity of raw materials to put this category ahead of food in exports . Until manufacturing space for lend-lease materiel becomes available , the growth of materiel exports will be slow . As fast as the British-French contracts are completed the plant space they occupy will be turned over to lend-lease . In the meantime , as the President reported , a quantity of the appropriation has been advanced to finish the plants in process of construction . This situation indicates that , without unavoidable delay , all the mediumlength contracts , which require from six to nine months and are for such items as tanks , simple ordnance items , trainer planes and agricultural machinery , will be in the works . The first date on which the long-term contracts will begin to be completed depends on the eliminatica of the factors listed above . Homely comparisons may make it easier to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two traffic highways , one clogged with laden trucks , the other a newly made road leading into it . The trucks on the main road have the right of way ; they started first ; they are carrying the same supplies for the same purpose and to the same destination . The side-road traffic will not show much movement into the main stream until room can be made for it . Faults Are Fundamental Or the production of materiel can be compared to water being drawn into a bucket from several spigots . Those turned on first are in flow , and they have filled the bucket almost to its capacity . For the spigot turned on later there is little cubic space to fill ; therefore , its flow is necessarily vmall . That statement of the lend-lease record , in this correspondent 's opinion , is both fair and accurate . So far as the agency is concerned , it seems to have been blamed for the faults of a situation it did not create and has not the authority , time or opportunity to rectify . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faults , which are basic : The main traffic road took too long in building ; was made too narrow ; was never well-cleared ; lacks a traffic chief , signals and driving-rules ; and consequently there are too many collisions . In the other comparison , the bucket is too small ; has too many holes , which the strikes by repairingcrews leave unmended ; and those who carry the bucket to the trough spill a lot of water . For these reasons : he lend-lease report was certain to be disappointing . But it should be remembered that the British took twelve months from January , 1940 , to let $3 billions in contracts here ; also , that in the first six months of 1941 we exported goods outside the Axis to the dollar-value of $1,361 millions ( and $209 millions more to Latin America ) , much of which was materiel.
