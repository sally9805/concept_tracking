The most popular new exhibition in London last week was at the stodgy old Royal Society of Arts . Strictly for the hot weather , the society had assembled 162 cartoons and sketches , by 50 artists , chosen to reflect the British sense of humor . Princess Elizabeth , in cool green and white , gave the show a royal launching with a tour of inspection that covered a century and a half of evidence . <P> <P> Among the more conspicuous exhibits on the walls of the society 's sedate Georgian library were the rowdy etchings of James Gillray ; he and his bibulous contemporary Thomas Rowlandson had fathered English cartooning . Working above Mistress Humphrey 's print shop in Piccadilly where his etchings sold for 18 pence , Gillray had scorched the court of George III with his acid portrayals of spendthrift profligates and pompous politicians . Rowlandson 's needle-sharp stylus had deflated many a Regency swell and belle . <P> Gentler and more elegant were the satires of such famed Victorian humorists as George du Maurier and Sir John Tenniel . Their Punch drawings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chided a more prosperous and conservative age . <P> Beside these artists , the 20th Century cartoonists whose work made up a good three fourths of the show often seemed little more than hurried illustrators of passing quips . Yet the best of them , typified by Punch 's present Editor Cyril K. Bird ( portraits of England 's beleaguered middle class ) and the Evening Standard 's bumptious David Low , showed the old English bite and a talent for good-natured selfcriticism , albeit streamlined . <P> Most spectators , including Princess Elizabeth , got their biggest chuckles from Rube Goldbergish efforts like W. Heath Robinson 's Magnetic Method of Stretching Spaghetti ( at the expense of Britain 's face-lengthening austerity program ) and H. M. Bateman 's Tragedy at Wellington Barracks , a study in horror-struck faces as a butter-fingered guardsman on parade drops his rifle . It was dapper Australian-born Cartoonist Bateman who had started the whole thing in a speech to the Royal Society last February , declaring it was high time the British had a " National Academy of Humorous Art .
