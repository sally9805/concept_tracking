Winner of a scrap-collecting contest for New Mexico schoolchildren was Connie Davis , 13 , of Carlsbad . California Shipbuilding Corp . readied the prize : a girl 's wrist watch , a chance to christen the Liberty ship Archbishop Lamy . Then someone discovered Connie was a boy . <P> Last week Connie , stopped by seafarers ' traditions against male ship sponsors , looked on while his runner-up smashed a champagne bottle across the Archbishop Lamy 's bow . Said he : " Well , I 'd have collected the scrap anyhow . I had two brothers captured on Bataan. "
