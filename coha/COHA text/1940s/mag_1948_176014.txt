As we traveled , we came near to a very <P> great hill , called Pendle Hill , and I was moved of the <P> Lord to go up to the top of it . . . When I was come to the top <P> ... the Lord let me see in what places He had a great people to <P> be gathered . <P> - Journal of George Fox <P> Howard Brinton is a friendly little man with a fuzz of silvery hair and a serene face in which a profound wisdom of the spirit does not imply a complete innocence of the world . One day last week he was discussing the nature and purposes of Pendle Hill , the Quaker school and religious retreat near Philadelphia which he and his wife Anna Brinton have managed for the last twelve years . As he spoke , the folding doors opened , and through the somewhat austere room padded an East Indian woman in full native garb . Looking neither to right nor left , she went out another door . Howard Brinton did not glance up or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had disappeared opened , and a young man in blue work shirt and dungarees tramped across the bare floor . Looking neither to right nor left , he vanished beyond the folding doors . A few moments later , Anna Brinton came to the door , leaned in and said : " The FBI man has gone . " Howard Brinton went on talking , but suddenly realized what had been said . " What FBI man ? " * he asked . But , with Quakerly tact , Anna Brinton had withdrawn . <P> That was in the morning . In the afternoon , Friend Brinton was consulted by a Chinese student about his studies in Neo-Platonism . Two relief workers consulted him about D.P. camps in Austria to which they had been assigned . At 4:30 , a term paper on U.S. cooperatives was read and pondered . In the evening there was a lecture on the philosophy of Quakerism . It was a typical day in the life of Director of Studies Brinton and of Pendle Hill . <P> Such personal " singularities " and enlivening activities might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , set in the midst of wealthy suburban Wallingford ( twelve miles southwest of Philadelphia ) , is a long way in time &; space from the Lancashire hill where Fox saw his vision of the future Religious Society of Friends . The gently rugged founder of Quakerism , known to his age as " the man in the leather breeches , " might have found Pendle Hill 's four spacious stone houses , its 15 acres of trees , lawns and gardens strangely remote from the round of jails , beatings and death which was the regular portion of early Quakers . The testimonies of Pendle Hill 's morning meetings for worship might have seemed somewhat prosy to a man whose fierce fervor of inward prayer is reported to have shaken the walls of the silent 17th Century meetings . <P> Yet he could not fail to sense that Friends at Pendle Hill were infused with a true Quaker spirit , relaxed but reverent , and that in their three chief activities-worship , study and work-they were seeking solutions for three of the great problems of the age : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the individual from the community , the alienation of man from God .
