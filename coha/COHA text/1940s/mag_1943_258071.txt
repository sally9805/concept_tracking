Above Suspicion ( M.G.M. ) is something new in Joan Crawford pictures . Instead of setting a special table for her saucer-eyed talents , it all but relegates Miss Crawford to playing stooge to pouty Fred MacMurray . Still worse , Joan 's usually endless array of hats is reduced to a bare subsistence level . <P> MacMurray &; Crawford are an American and his bride in prewar Germany , but not on anything so innocent as a honeymoon . In quest of a secret which Great Britain needs to know they get involved in disguises , a Liszt-accompanied murder , battles with the Gestapo . They also run afoul of such suspicious figures as Basil Rathbone and Conrad Veidt . Strangely enough , it all adds up to a better-than-average summertime melodrama . <P> But for Miss Crawford it is not much of an event to mark her departure from M.G.M. , where she has been a big name ever since the gin-drenched days of Our Dancing Daughters ( 1928 ) . Her new boss : Warner 's . Reported inducement : " an executive job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milestone : his last picture for anybody . He died last spring ( TIME , April 12 ) , age 50 , of a heart attack , on a Hollywood golf course . Often regarded as Eric von Stroheim 's most formidable rival as a fondler of monocles , German-born Veidt first came to fame in Robert Wiene 's bizarre fantasy , The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari . Other weirdies , like The Hands of Mr. Orlac , followed . Women fainted , men screamed , children chortled when they were shown . By 1926 , when Veidt went to Hollywood , audiences had got hold of themselves pretty well , but his adroit villainy was always good for a hiss.
