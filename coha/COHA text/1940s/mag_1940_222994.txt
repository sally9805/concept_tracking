For news of the election see the special 8-page Election Extra which TIME publishes this week . The Extra is to be delivered with the issue everywhere except Florida , parts of Texas and the Mountain and Pacific Coast States . To subscribers there , the Extra is being rushed by plane in the hope that it will be delivered separately in the same mail as the regular issue . But it is inevitable in an operation conducted at such speed and under such pressure that deliveries may be late in some areas .
