txt It seems strange that in all the discussion concerning lite . Ives-Quinn bill , much of the opposition to which is centered about the argument that it is impossible successfully to coerce whites and Negroes to work together in harmony , there has been no reference to the experience growing out of the Philadelphia Transportation Company strike following the hiring of Negro motormen at the behest of the Federal Fair Employment Practice Committee . That attempt at compulsion , carried out at the point of the bayonet , complicated by an . inter-union struggle among the employes of the Philadelphia Transportation Company ( company union versus TWU ) , certainly would seem to have justified the most grim forebodings . By the same token , if it turned out successfully , it should give heart to those who hope for the success of the more intelligent forms of compulsion envisaged in the Ives-Quinn bill . Results Held Satisfactory Accordingly , I have made inquiry from a source I believe to be wholly responsible and have , found that the present results of the Philadelphia strike are roughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , as might be expected , a period of racial tension . This soon subsided and , at present , Negro and white employes are working together , sharing common lockers and eating together without apparent friction . 2 . The policy of hiring and upgrading Negroes has continued and representatives of the PTC have publicly stated that the use of Negro operators in positions formerly held exclusively by whites " has passed the risk stage " and is causing no incidents . Illustrative is the recent promotion of a Negro to the position of supervisor in the company 's Way Department , which gives him authority over a considerable number of white and Negro foremen . 3 . Some of the Negro operators who were hired as ' a result of the FEPC order have since become proficient and have even been assigned to the training of subsequently hired white employes .

There appears to be ' no record of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but about 2,200 votes were cast and the total number of Negroes then employed by the PTC did not exceed 900. 5 . It is the feeling of company and union officials and of civic leaders generally that the experience of the strike , deplorable as it was , served to educate the public on the problem presented and has resulted in the improvement rather than deterioration of race relations . It seems to me that these facts have a bearing upon the problem at hand and should assuage some of the more extravagant fears recently expressed in these columns . WHITMAN KNAPP . New York , Feb. 28 , 1945 . Opportunity for Leadership To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The ardent and earnest supporters of the Ives-Quinn bill have the unattractive defect of their qualities  --  intransigence . On Feb. 16 Mrs. Norton of New Jersey reintroduced in the House a bill to make permanent the Fair Employment Practice Committee and to prohibit discrimination in employment because of race , creed , color , national origin or ancestry ( H. R. 2232 ) . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Senate ( S. 101 ) . The bill , which is known as the bipartisan bill , defines as " unfair employment practice refusal to hire , discharge or discriminate because of race , creed , etc. ; it also provides that it is unfair employment practice * * * for any labor union to deny full membership rights and privileges , * * * to expel from membership * * * or to discriminate against any member because of his race , " etc . No Penal Provisions It creates a commission of five members  --  term five years , salary $10,000 a year  --  who " shall not engage in any other business , vocation or employment . " It defines the duties and powers of the commission in much the same language as the Ives-Quinn bill . Being a Federal statute , it is limited to employment affecting commerce , contracts with the United states , and unfair practices of labor unions affecting commerce . The chief difference between the two bills is that the bipartisan bill contains no penal provisions . Another important difference is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or religious bodies , as the Ives bill does . One would think that no employer of labor would be less opposed to anti-discrimination legislation than a hospital or a school . If the advocates of the Ives bill would give up their all-or-nothing attitude and be content to see what can be accomplished by reasonable regulations , conferences and conciliation , without criminal penalties , leaving to the civil courts the cases which could not be settled by conference , they would win the support of many who are now opposing the bill . New York has been a leader and an example to other States in its social legislation . It would be unfortunate to invoke the criminal law , even as a threat , without first testing the methods of education and conciliation . Let New York lead , but let it lead wisely . " Why so hot , my little man ? " In his letter published Feb. 25 Arthur A. Ballantine argues like too many opponents of Henry A. Wallace 's plan for the solution of the post-war unemployment problem , as embodied in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Having mentioned Mr. Wallace 's plan Mr. Ballantine promptly forgets it and follows his own I train of thought . The Wallace plan assumes throughout the leadership of private enterprise in the solution of our post-war unemployment difficulties . The Government is only to help when conditions call for such aid , and Government assistance , wherever possible , is to be furnished through the channels of private enterprise . In other words , bridge building or road construction or any other Government undertaking is to be the task of private business although it will be carried on at the cost of the Government . This need not mean the Federal Government only . States and municipalities should have their own general plans ready for the time when there is a decline in the opportunities for private employment . Mr. Wallace emphasized the need of a ready plan rather than compulsion . Conclusion Disputed At no time does the Wallace plan justify Mr. Ballantine 's assertion that it " involves in the end the essential Government direction and control of employment and production . " Nor does it imply Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarantee jobs , the Government can not long rn. frain from telling people where and at what they are to work . If the Government is to guarantee the supply of products for public consumption , the Government in the end will determine what products are to be produced . " In much that is now being written on this subject one finds the tendency to fall back on Professor Hayek instead of arguing the merits of the case . Thus , having tied the Wallace proposition to collectivist conditions in Soviet Russia with which it has nothing in common Mr. Ballantine quotes Professor Hayek as follows : " What our planners demand is a central direction of all economic activity according to a single plan , laying down how the resources of society should be ' consciously directed ' to serve particular ends in a certain way . " It is a pity that in discussing the all-important question of post-war unemployment the defenders of laissezfaire do not confine their interpretation to Mr. Wallace 's own statements . It is equally , deplorable that the admirers of Professor Hayek 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author himself has no objection to compulsion , providing , seemingly , that the person compelled is not the one he favors . It is indeed curious that people who accept Professor Hayek 's defense of laissez-faire have never taken the trouble to quote him on the vital question of unemployment . Professor Hayek on Jobs Professor Hayek insists ( Page 207 ) that during the post-war reconversion period the Government must not provide jobs for those unemployed who can not be absorbed by private enterprise . In his opinion there should be liberal provisions for " retraining " but the real cure he sees in a reduction in wages . Having laid down the absolute need of lower wages , Professor Hayek continues : " If , then , the trade unions successfully resist any lowering of the wages of the particular groups in question that is , the new war skills there will be only two alternatives open : either coercion will have to be used ( i. e. , certain individuals will have to be selected for compulsory transfer to other and relatively less well-paid positions ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relatively high wages they have earned during the war must be allowed to remain unemployed until they are willing to accept work at relatively lower wages . " In other words , Professor Hayek demands laissez-faire for industry but coercion for labor . In its practical application his laudable fear of serfdom succumbs to feudal ethics . Mr. Wallace , on the other hand , wants neither to starve the workers into submission nor any kind of compulsion . He is for the middle way as it is practiced with great success in the Scandinavian countries : collaboration among Government , private enterprise and labor . MANYA GORDON .
