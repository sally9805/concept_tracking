Manhattan 's Museum of Modern Art , the No. 1 U.S. showroom of contemporary painting , attracts 550,000 paying customers a year . There , pictures and public eye each other uneasily , in an air-conditioned atmosphere of mutual distrust . To arbitrate the silent battle of wills that usually ensues , the museum employs three well-primed guides whom it calls docents ( rhymes with no sense ) . The docents talk and talk-a bit nervously . <P> They are often interrupted , and the questions are apt to be tough ones . The museum last week had on sale an intriguing pamphlet entitled The Questioning Public , which told something of what the docents are up against . <P> No Chinatown . Children , they agreed , are easiest to handle , not only because the little innocents are used to being led around by the nose anyway , but also because they are not automatically prejudiced , like many of their elders , against unfamiliar sights . The adults are apt to be casual but hostile . They often seem to " feel the museum 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> A wise docent makes it clear at the start that " unfortunately there are no ' ten easy lessons , ' no short cuts to developing a mature response to art . " If his audience snickers in front of a picture or sculpture , the docent may attempt to restore the dignity of the occasion by quoting Director Alfred Barr Jr . ' s neatly apologetic dictum : " We try to collect and exhibit whatever painting seems creatively significant ; and if in the course of time one or two choices out of ten prove worthy , I believe the general selection is justified . " That line is no help when they come to the museum 's most important pictures , such as the great Guernica mural that shows Picasso in a wilder and more difficult mood than his recent one . Faced with that deliberately and violently ugly protest against a German bombing raid ( in the Spanish Civil War ) , visitors fairly bristle with questions : <P> " Why should we enjoy such a work ? " <P> " Assuming it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it were more understandable , like Norman Rockwell 's Four Freedoms posters ? " <P> " Why was Picasso sloppy enough to leave drips and smears of paint on it ? " <P> No Facts . Most of all , say the docents , the public is " bewildered by the absence of facts " in such paintings . Comparatively naturalistic artists such as Czanne and Van Gogh get a worshipfully warm reception , the museum says , and for Salvador Dali , whose surrealism depends on meticulous realism , " the audience has an especial place in its heart . " Even Picasso is admired for his early " blue period " and neo-classical pictures . <P> For those who wish Picasso had kept his art " recognizable , " the docents can quote the protean genius 's own words . " What do you think an artist is , " he once burst out , " an imbecile who has only his eyes ? " They might also suggest that baffled gallery-goers become willing " imbeciles " themselves-using their eyes to the full , and not asking too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the docents.
