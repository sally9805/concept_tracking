Phonograph antiquarians , who hunt for sacred if scratchy records out of the dear dead past , had a wonderful prize offered them last week . It was a 1912 disc of the late great Lillian Russell , singing the hit of her career , Come Down , My Evenin ' Star . Copies were issued by Manhattan 's Collectors Record Shop . The recording showed its age . The sound of the little string orchestra that accompanied Lillian had the antique flavor of the wormholes in a Gutenberg Bible or the patina on a Hellenistic bronze . <P> But what surprised youngish musicians was the fact that beauteous Lillian Russell was also obviously a woman of voice . She took her high notes with operatic aplomb , turned her phrases with the delicacy of a diva . There was even a hint in the recording of the lump in Lillian 's throat which she frequently got when she sang this particular song . That catch in the throat had a history . <P> Paris Green . Come Down , My Evenin ' Star was the work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who wrote for the revues at the old Weber &; Fields Music Hall when David Warfield , Fay Templeton , DeWolf Hopper and Willie Collier were among its stars . When Lillian made her debut there in 1899 in a travesty on The Girl from Maxim 's , Honey Stromberg was her musical director . For four years he wrote his finest tunes for her . One day in 1902 Honey , an acute sufferer from chronic rheumatism , was reported seriously ill at his home in Freeport , Long Island . He asked Lillian to visit him , told her he wanted to write her a specially beautiful number . A few days later he took a dose of Paris green and died . In his overcoat pocket was found the manuscript of Come Down , My Evenin ' Star . <P> As a singer , Lillian Russell might have cut a minor swath at the Metropolitan . Trained in opera from infancy , she claimed to be able to negotiate high Cs eight times a performance , seven performances a week . But when Nellie Melba told Lillian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was absolute , she took the advice . <P> Evergreen . Long after Honey Stromberg 's death , she sang his song for Diamond Jim Brady at his oyster and beefsteak gorges at Bustanoby 's . John D. Rockefeller once paid $500 to hear her sing it . In 1912 , at a Weber &; Fields reunion , when Lillian was 51 and over 170 lb. , she was asked to do it again . As she broke , monumentally , into Come Down , My Evenin ' Star , an audience including Arthur Brisbane , William Randolph Hearst , Diamond Jim Brady , Cond Nast and Charles Dana Gibson blubbered frankly over its boiled shirts . <P> The missing record of the song was found by Jack Caidin , head of Collectors Record Shop , in a New Jersey attic . It was a privately made 12-in. waxing , signed as a souvenir for one of Lillian 's long-forgotten admirers , and had never been reprinted . Caidin had been looking for it for a long time . Last week his business with copies of the disc told him he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
