For two weeks Nicaragua 's foxy , folksy Dictator Anastasio ( " Tacho " ) Somoza toured his volcano-studded domain . Ostensibly , he was inspecting his Atlantic Highway ( not yet completed ) and the villages and towns along the Atlantic coast . Actually he was giving his local jejes ( leaders ) the word on 1951 's presidential election . Tacho , who was President from 1937 to 1947 , would like to be President again in name as well as in fact . <P> Last week , impressive in campaign khaki , Tacho returned to his dusty capital to a hero 's welcome . Some 25,000 Liberal Party stalwarts , including Tacho 's uncle and stooge , arthritic , old ( 76 ) President Victor Roman y Reyes , turned out to acclaim " our guide and presidential candidate . " Said scheming Tacho : " If at the legal time of the election the people maintain the determination they have demonstrated today , I shall take the place the Liberal Party has ordered me to take .
