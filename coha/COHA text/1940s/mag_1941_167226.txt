Wendell L. Willkie waited until he was back in Manhattan last week to give his answer to a question topmost in the mind of many a U. S. businessman : Is war socializing British industry ? In his ten days in England , Willkie had talked with hundreds of businessmen-from a dart-playing bricklayer named Albert Phillips to William Edward Rootes , " the British Alfred Sloan , " President of The Society of Motor Manufacturers &; Traders . He had visited 50 factories ( in London . Coventry . Birmingham , Liverpool , Manchester , Oldham , Sheffield , Nottingham , etc . ) . From the evidence so gathered , ex-Businessman Willkie said : <P> " British industry socialized ? Certainly not-neither during the war nor after it-in my judgment . . . . The wealth of the old aristocracy-the income of the dukes and the duchesses living off estates-will be a thing of the past when the war is over . And the fruits of the industrial system will be better distributed , through public housing projects , higher wages , social laws and the like-as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and capitalistic . " <P> The British Government , said Mr. Willkie. has done four things to increase war production : 1 ) It has gone directly into the munitions business , building and staffing its own arsenals. 2 ) It has built " shadow plants " - new war plants in the shadow of existing private plants . The British Treasury supplies the money and the private company supplies the management for a small fee . 3 ) For new war-order plants that can be readily converted to peacetime use after the war , the Government finances the plant itself , the businessman furnishes the machinery and working capital . He earns about 5% on his investment . 4 ) Plenty of Government orders are let on straight contracts to existing companies . On these the profit is also limited to around 5% . <P> Result of this flexible system : it gives the individual businessman leeway to do his best individual work . Said Mr. Willkie : " The enterprise fella can enterprise . You ought to see the way Rootes goes after his job . Most of them are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we can convert them into private factories after the war and there wo n't be any nonsense about whether private enterprise will survive or not . ' So they 're working their shirts off . Of course they also have the motive of patriotism , but the big thing is their natural business instincts are brought into play . " <P> The quickest route to socialism , says Willkie , is loose fiscal policy , which wrecks private enterprise whether the citizenry wants it wrecked or not . On that score the British are taxing themselves far more cruelly than is the U. S. , are paying-as-they-go for as much of war 's cost ( currently around one-third ) as they can . <P> Mr. Willkie on labor and leadership :
