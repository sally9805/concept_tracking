The U.S. Navy is going to be bigger than the combined navies of the rest of world . <P> Red-white- &-blue; thrills ran up &; down backs of Congressmen when Carl Vinson of Georgia , chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee , told this fact to his colleagues . He was just explaining how unconquerably large the U.S. Navy will be when 1,900,000 tons of warships ( see p. 45 ) provided in a bill which last week unanimously passed the House , have been completed . <P> Congressmen on the floor of the House did their best to realize what a historic announcement had issued from Carl Vinson 's prosaic lips . He had , in effect , announced that some time between 1944 and 1946 the U.S. would emerge as a world power fabulously more dominant than Britain ever was . <P> Like it or not , the U.S. - if that Navy comes to pass , even if it be a Navy that is mainly air force with seagoing auxiliaries - will have the major say in world affairs . Then the U.S. will no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red schoolhouse . It will be the nation that has the power by yea or nay to open the seas and widen economic frontiers to all peaceful peoples , to close them as readily to aggressors . <P> As little as two years ago the nation would have been shocked at Carl Vinson 's announcement . Last week Congressmen applauded . But Americans had not yet fully understood - if , indeed , he had fully understood himself - the fateful , the far-reaching , the now inevitable implications of what he said .
