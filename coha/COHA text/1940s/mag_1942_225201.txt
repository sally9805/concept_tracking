A Russian-born U.S. merchant seaman just back from Murmansk said last week : <P> " Bombs fell night &; day . Night &; day men and women worked , unloading ships . One afternoon a bottleneck developed at one of the docks . A bomb had wrecked both derricks . Just after dark a Red Army company marched up , faces drawn . All night they worked , officers and men . In the morning the ship was unloaded and the company fell in and was taken back to the front , about 30 miles away . Their 24-hour leave for rest was ended . <P> " There was no difference between Communists and non-Communists in Murmansk . All were fighting the Germans . Now there is no politics ; now there is war . <P> " The people in Murmansk make no distinction between Nazis and Germans . One used to hear : ' The German people will revolt against the Nazis . ' Now one hears : ' The Germans will perhaps revolt when we Russians have killed them all . Then there will be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me how a German plane bombed their huts . Then the plane was shot down and the pilot bailed out . First he began shooting at us . Then he saw we were too many , threw away his gun and held up his hands : ' Kamerad . Kamerad . ' When we took him by the throat he was not a Nazi . He was a German . <P> " In Murmansk there was no tea . Butter and milk were only for children and for the sick . There were 1,000 wounded Englishmen in the hospital . They got milk . The men &; women in Murmansk were lucky to get bread . <P> " Everyone asked about the second front . ' We will go on fighting , but we need help . ' they said . <P> " Many times , when people found I was American , they asked how I liked being bombed from Finnish bases sometimes by Finnish planes , while the American Government was friendly with Mannerheim . I did not know how to answer . "     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
