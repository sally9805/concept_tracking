In May of last year a brainy , bespectacled ousted leader of Britain 's Labor Party became a missionary . Just back from a round-the-world trip with long stopovers in Russia and Free China , Sir Richard Stafford Cripps was convinced that despite the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact , Russia might yet be Britain 's ally in World War II . His mission : to go to Moscow and help bring this about . <P> This week Missionary Sir Stafford saw his mission accomplished . In Moscow , after two audiences with Joseph Stalin , he sat down with Foreign Commissar Viacheslav Mikhailovich Molotov , drafted and signed a 117-word compact between Britain and Russia . <P> No treaty of friendship , the Pact stated tersely that the two countries would support each other " in the present war against Hitlerite Germany , " that neither would make a separate peace . <P> A thorough realist , Sir Stafford would be the last man in the world to pat himself on the back . For months his job has been to sit outside the Kremlin walls , waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutual fear . The actual negotiation was done by Hitler 's invading armies . <P> To another diplomat in waiting , a Russian , the Pact was equally good news . He was onetime Foreign Commissar Maxim Maximovich Litvinoff , once No. 1 sales man of Russia 's United Front . For a decade he held forth at Geneva , talking for collective security and against Fascism , was waved to the sidelines in 1939 when Russia changed her tactics , began her appeasement play for time . <P> Last week , in an English-language broadcast from Moscow , Litvinoff too ended his silent wait . Once again he was saying that it was the job of Russia , Britain ( and this time he added the U.S. ) to stop Hitler , to destroy " the greatest obstacle to the development of civilization that has ever existed . " <P> Broadcasting from London , Winston Churchill promised that Britain would do her part by increased bombings of Ger many and " that unhappy , abject , subject province of Germany which used to be called Italy . " <P> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancy semantics by certain government officials who publicized Britain and Russia not as allies but as " co-belligerents , " Churchill stated flatly , " the agreement is , of course , an alliance and the Russian people are now our allies . " <P> To the British press and public , impatient with word-juggling and extravagantly hopeful of the results that might follow Russia 's entry into the war , these were cheering words . <P> But notwithstanding the Churchill statement , there were signs that not all quarters of British officialdom found it easy to warm up to the Bolsheviks . BBC omitted The Internationale from its weekly program of anthems of Britain 's allies , was swamped by protests from , public , press and Parliament . To a reporter , a BBC official said with historic detachment : " We shall certainly play one of the Russian anthems . The question is : what is the Russian anthem ? " BBC compromised by playing a recording of a Red Air Force song , Plane , My Plane ! Labor 's Chief Whip Lord Strabolgi slyly reminded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labor Party meetings , that he had seen Minister of Home Security Herbert Morrison singing " with great gusto and evident enjoyment " :
