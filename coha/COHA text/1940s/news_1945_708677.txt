txt Letters to The Times STEPHEN RUSHMORE , M.D. , HOLY TRINITY MEN 'S CLUB HARRIET B. LAIDLAW. pg . 18 Letters to The Times Medical Laws Protested Association 's Stand Questioned by Middlesex University Dean To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In the letters to THE TIMES on May 17 , 1945 , Dr. Victor Johnson , secretary , Council on Medical Education and Hospitals , American Medical Association , implies , but does not state explicitly , that the council disapproves of a quota system in selecting medical students under which Jewish students are excluded because they are Jews . If the council really disapproves , has it ever said so in public ? Dr. Johnson 's statement is merely that the American Medical Association does not impose a quota upon medical schools . Dr. Morris Fishbein , sometimes spokesman for the American Medical Association , in his now well-known letter , has acknowledged the existence of a quota system . Why , then , does the Council on Medical Education do nothing about such an enormity ? That there is discrimination , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the council approves some medical schools in which discrimination is practiced . A difficulty for an outsider lies in obtaining documentary evidence or corroborated oral statements giving to this evil a local habitation and a named institution . Dr. Johnson refers to a certain medical school in these words : " The school in Massachusetts to which Mr. Ridder refers has received exactly the same help which has been given by the council and the American Medical Association on countless occasions in other institutions . This help consists in a survey service in which all details of the educational program are examined in detail . On the basis of the survey , recommendations for improvement are made to the school and assistance is given to fulfill the recommendations . " Assistance Policy The school in Massachusetts to which Mr. Ridder referred is Middlesex University School of Medicine . I do not know what assistance the council has actually given to other medical schools . I do know that the council has not done for Middlesex , what Dr. Johnson has said , not only in his letter but on several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical schools . The evidence in support of my statement is , in part , given below . A general policy of the association is set forth as follows : ' Resolved , Therefore , that this association earnestly and respectfully appeals to the trustees of hospitals to open their wards for the purpose of clinical instruction , satisfied that they will thereby more efficiently aid the cause of humanity and more perfectly accomplish the benevolent intentions of the founders of the charity . " That is an old resolve and pertinent today , yet the council has never made such an appeal for Middlesex . What has the council done for Middlesex ? In June , 1942 , soon after I became dean of the medical school , I appeared in person before the council , I set forth what I had in mind for Middlesex and I asked the council if they would penalize in any way a hospital approved by them for the training of interns , if such hospital accepted Middlesex students as clinical clerks . They gave me no oral answer , and in the letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them they omitted all reference to the question which I had asked . Their letter contains , however , the following significant sentence : " The council did not feel justified in offering any approval or even encouragement in connection with your efforts . " I still wanted an answer , so I wrote again reminding them of the omission . In their second letter appears the following paragraph : " Hence , if a hospital maintains such satisfactory standards " ( for the training of interns ) " the council would not consider it within its field to decide whether or not it should accept students from any medical school as clinical clerks . " Six months later that ruling was changed and made more restrictive . The timing of these events is significant . The first letter , from which I have quoted , is dated June 7 , 1942 . I had accepted the deanship of Middlesex two months after Pearl Harbor because of the evident serious shortage of physicians and the great need of salvaging everything medical which could be utilized . I thought the school could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up its mind that the school should not be salvaged . But the armed forces of the United States have in the present conflict given commissions in the medical corps to over three hundred and fifty graduates of the school . On several occasions informal requests have been made orally to individual members of the council concerning possible help by the council in securing clinical facilities . The reply has always been that the council has nothing to do with the hospitals . It is at this point that the resolve already referred to is pertinent . There persists , then , a vicious circle : the school can not get clinical facilities because it is not approved ; the school can not get approval because it can not get clinical facilities . If the American Medical Association has really attempted to assist Middlesex , the result is a confession of impotence on the part of the association which neither its friends nor its enemies are likely to acknowledge . Approving Authority Statute Dr. Johnson refers to the decision by Judge Cabot and notes some of His Honor 's comments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge Cabot himself makes . I have rearranged the order in which the points were made , but in substance Judge Cabot said , in the court room or in his decision , that he did not have of his own knowlof , ge a ; 2 r C:cis.on as to medical education , that he had t ' depend on what others told him , that h regarded a comparison with other medi ? cal schools in Boston as a pertin , ... : if not a necessary consideration to b weighed , and that the quality of thgraduates was one of the best ways determining the quality of the medics. ' education given by any school . On thbasis of the evidence submitted to him and with his understanding of what the law said , he declared that he had to uphold the decision of the Approvin Authority . But he said also ( a ) the statute establishing the Approving Authority is poorly drawn . ( b ) " Th statute lays down neither for the Approving Authority nor this court and , guide by which approval should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It wo ? ' serve no useful purpose to recount those very considerable number of aspects which might , standing by themselves , entitle Middlesex to approval . * * * Nor would it be helpful or material to point out the difficulties Middlesex has had in overcoming these deficiencie. in spite of a very genuine attempt in recent years to improve its standards . Nor is it material to consider what it might be in months or years hence even though it be recognized that th very fact of approval would remov some of the obstacles with which th. , school is faced in its attempt to improve itself . * * Thus , the adoptior by the school of the accelerated program deprived it * * * of almost a year in which to continue to improve th. standards of the school . " Deficiencies Hold Surely , the points set forth by JudgCabot would be material in a trill ; just evaluation of the school . Why th ... did he not give them weight ? Th answer is , of course , simple . Judgi Cabot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , anc these points are really arguments for changing the law . In addition to the defects in the law to which Judge Cabot called attention , there are others which Middlesex pointed out . For example , if a school is once approved , approval can never be withdrawn , no matter how much the school may deteriorate . Then , if a school meets the requirements 90 per cent , it must be placed in the same class as a. school which meets the requirements only 10 per cent , and approval must be refused . It can not be given further opportunity to make up its deficiencies . Furthermore , it is not clear how any new medical school can ever be opened in Massachusetts . It is for these reasons that Middlesex is asking the Massachusetts Legislature to change the law . I do not belittle the accomplishments of the American Medical Association in its efforts to improve medical education in the United States , but praise should be more discriminatingly bestowed , and a truer estimate of the proper function of the association should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ideas of others than as an originator that this organization has best served society in the past and is likely to assist it in the future . STEPHEN RUSHMORE , M. D. , Dean , Middlesex University , School of Medicine . Waltham , Mass. , May 23 , 1945 . Protests Horthy 's Denunciations To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : We , American citizens of Hungarian origin , deeply resent the letter which appeared in your columns of May 16 , 1945 , under the signatures of Ferenc , Gondor and Emil Lengyel . These two men are absolutely unqualified anti unauthorized to raise any objections to Admiral Horthy 's presence at the peace tables should the Allies invite him thereto . Their suggestion , furthermore , that Michael Karolyi would be the proper person to represent Hungary at the peace tables is so worthless that it should be dismissed as so much rubbish . Karolyi had his chance , in 1918 , to show what he could do , and what he did was to turn the country over to the Communists , who immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S CLUB .

We are accustomed to his unrealistic and often defeatist approach to efforts for world organization , but while our young men are wounded and dying in the Japanese war for him to sound a defeatist note is mischievous and intolerable .
