txt WASHINGTON , March 18 ? The House began debate today on the $7,000,000,000 Appropriation Bill to implement the lease-lend law , and heard it described as a measure which means the " ultimate downfall of the dictators , " and peace for the world . Starting with the Appropriations Committee , which reported the bill without amendments , and on through expressions of advocates of the legislation , ran the theme that there is no turning back for America in its " all-out " aid program for Britain , now that this country 's policy has been set through the law and President Roosevelt 's subsequent declaration . Representative Woodrum of Virginia , leading the debate , described the measure a " transfusion to Britain . " Some Republican isolationists insisted , however , that the amount of this bill was " only a starter , " that it meant the ultimate entry of the United States into the war , that the use of American convoys was imminent and that the sending of American troops abroad was indicated in the Administration 's , policy . Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the appropriation . Its Appropriations Committee reported out the $3,446,000,000 Supply Bill for the Navy , and Senate and House conferees agreed upon the terms of two authorization bills , totaling $345,731,330 , for air and sea base improvements , including projects at Guam and Samoa . Only minor changes were made in either measure . In submitting the $7,000,000,000 bill to the House , the committee said that the sum was " stupendous and the program gigantic , but the issue is greater than both . " " It must be accepted , " the committee said , " or we become a faltering welsher . " " The program now needs to proceed with the utmost expedition consistent with prudence if it is to have the effect which the law contemplates and which the American people unquestionably overwhelmingly approve . " The decision not to itemize the bill was made , the committee explained , to preserve the strategic // END OF DICTATORS IS SEEN IN AID BILL // value of material to be produced , and said that it hoped " that what might be considered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country shall not become ' strategic news ' elsewhere to harm of the very countries we are trying to assist and to ourselves . " The committee disclosed from testimony of Secretaries Hull , Stimson and Knox , and from other government officials , that contracts awarded to date for material amount to $12,600,000,000 . Contracts for 302 government plants total $1,574,000,000 . Privately financed plants certified for assistance amount to $393,000,000 . In addition , the British have financed sixty-one plants for a. total of $171,000,000 . British Resources Examined Expecting questions on the House floor , the committee set forth its findings as to British resources and to their orders placed in this country , and the payments thereon to date . Of this , the committee said : " The total of such orders placed by the British Purchasing Mission ' to Jan. 1 , 1941 , is $2,700,000,000 . Payments on these orders to March 12 totaled $1,682,000,000 , consisting of $1,300,000,000 paid prior to Jan. 1 , 1941 , and $382,000,000 paid during the period Jan. 1 to March 12 , 1941 . " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash and some goods not delivered have been partially paid for in advance . " The committee has been assured that none of the $7,000,000,000 contained in the bill will be used to pay for materials under any orders heretofore placed by the British Government , and that sufficient existing dollar resources and dollars to be acquired by them will be available to pay for those orders . " The estimated British holdings in the United States as of Jan. 1 last consisted of $616,000,000 of marketable securities , $900,000,000 in direct investments , $292,000,000 in gold , $54,000,000 in official dollar balances and $305,000,000 in private dollar balances . " These figures necessarily have changed , as these resources have been drawn upon between Jan. 1 and March 12 by $382,000,000 to meet payments for the goods ordered . The committee is also advised that the British assets in this country , in so far as they are not needed for payment on their orders here , will be given as security on defense articles which the United States may furnish to them . Britain 's Huge Outlay Emphasized " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United Kingdom and the Dominions are currently amounting monthly to $1,750,000,000 , of which $1,500,000,000 is by the United Kingdom and $250,000,000 by the Dominions . Canada will spend $1,400,000,000 in the fiscal year 1941-42 on her direct war effort , which is 25 per cent of her expected national income . " The agreements with the governments to be assisted under ' An Act to Promote the Defense of the United States ' rest with the President of the United States . His is the responsibility to determine the terms and conditions under which the nations receiving this aid should make a return to the United States . " A nation engaged in a death struggle with a mortal enemy needs , in addition to the tools of war , the maintenance of its own economy and financial stability in order to pursue successfully its efforts . If the United States furnishes Great Britain with defense articles but upsets her economy the aims and - purposes of our assistance would be defeated . " Before reporting the bill , several amendments were defeated in the committee . One was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $10,000,000,000 ; another was by Representative Lambertson of Kansas to reduce the total to $5,000,000,000 ; and another by Representative Rich to halve the appropriation . Administration leaders said they felt assured no amendments would be accepted by the House tomorrow . Speaker Sam Rayburn predicted that the measure would pass with less than fifty votes against it . Why It . Is Cash on the Barrel Head In opening the debate , Mr. Woodrum gave three reasons for appropriating the money in cash , rather than partly in cash and partly in contractual authority . " In the first place , " he said , " to put $7,000,000,000 in cool cash down on the barrel-head carries a certain message to certain people that they will understand very much better and very much more effectively than they will understand the speeches you and I make about the subject . " In the second place , to put up all the money in cash gives a certain flexibility to the program that could not be obtained if you had a part of it in cash and part in contractual authority . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need airplanes . Tomorrow she may need tanks . The day after that it may be something else . Speed and flexibility are the keynotes of effective aid to Britain . Therefore , we make all of the money available in cash . " In the third place , to put part of it in contractual authorizations gives a very involved situation when it comes to our.bookkeeping . " This act will be a transfusion of new life to the beleaguered democracies of the world . The world will see America with its unconquerable spirit , its vast and limitless resources turn on its great industrial power on a 100 per cent capacity effort to supply effective material to the defenders of freedom in the world . With this all-out American effort , there can and there will be only one result , and that is the ultimate downfall of dictators . " No Turning Back , Says Taber Representative Taber of New York , ranking Republican member of the committee , said " the die has been cast , " that there was no turning back until victory for democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been justified to the last detail . " But Mr. Taber , while supporting the general program , called upon Mr. Roosevelt to " cooperate in this defense program ' by putting an end " to labor racketeering " and inter-union strikes , by placing procurement and management of defense production in the hands of one man , and by ridding the National Labor Relations Board of its present members , and replacing them with those " who represent the United States . " The President , he also contended , should withhold his endorsement of " unnecessary " appropriations for civilian and social activities ; and by getting rid of " those in his Cabinet who are not capable of handling their positions and who are a drag and a hindrance to the defense program . " Representatives Knutson of Minnesota , Rich , Pender of Ohio , Lamberton , Dirksen of Illinois and Tinkham of Massaachusetts , all Republicans , hit at various parts of the measure . They said the nation was committed to a policy which would mean eventual participation by this country in the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the measure was a " second invitation to Hitler to fight . " Mr. Dirksen said the measure " is only a beginning " of aid to Britain , and that from now on , " we are confronted with the problem of effort , not policy . " " The miniute we part company with the President now , look out , " he said .
