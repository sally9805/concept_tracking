txt Letters to The Times WALTER P. REUTHER , MAY ROGERS WADLEIGH Letters to The Times Mr. Reuther States Position Vice President of UAW Tells Union Side of General Motors Dispute To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your editorial of Nov. 22 , " The G. M. Strike , " stands in strange contrast to the competent , unbiased reporting which your paper has given day by day of the attempt of our union to negotiate its ' wage demand with General Motors Corporation . The editorial is based upon misapprehension of the facts of the case as reported in your own columns . This is a serious charge to make against THE NEW YORK TIMES . I therefore wish to state the grounds on which it is made . The editorial ' omits these , among other , facts from consideration : 1 . That the union from the first has told the corporation that , if it can prove it can not pay 30 per cent increase in wages without raising prices , then the wage demand will be scaled down to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused to engage in collective bargaining with the union  --  refusing public negotiations with press and radio representatives present ; refusing in private negotiations to discuss the corporation 's ability to pay a wage increase ; refusing conciliation by Government representatives ; and finally , refusing arbitration of the dispute . 3 . That the corporation 's counterproposals were explicitly based upon its expectation that the higher wages it offered would be considered by OPA in raising price ceilings for GM products . 4 . That the union rejected these wage offers because it would not be party to any increase in GM prices . 5 . That the corporation refused to I offer even a 1 per cent wage increase under the stipulation that it would not use such wage increase in asking OPA to raise price ceilings for its products . If consideration had been given to these and other facts of the case , as reported fully in the Detroit dispatches of your correspondent Walter W. Ruch , the editorial which you printed could not have been written . Union 's Charge Cited It refers to the union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " telling a big lie and repeating it often . " It does not disclose the lie the union 's charge refers to . GM is trying to convince the public that any increase in wages must of necessity result in higher prices . This is a lie and a dangerous and damaging one . The union 's demand is based on the belief that GM can pay 30 per cent higher wages and can absorb the increase out of the greatly increased profits per car it will make on its large post-war production . This possibility , as a general proposition , is well known to any observer of our industrial history . It has been demonstrated by GM in particular through its own record of production , wages and profits , as the union 's brief ; bows . Yet in your editorial you fail to give any inkling of the nature or the effect of the GM statement to which the union charge refers . The editorial describes the union 's position as a demand for a 30 per cent wage increase , coupled with a demand that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its members but the profits and prices of the corporation . " No reference whatever is made to the union 's proposition that if GM can show that it can not pay this wage increase under existing prices , then the union will scale its demand to what GM can pay without raising prices . That is not a demand by the union to fix the prices and profits of the corporation . It is a demand for a wage increase that can be paid without injury to the corporation 's customers or stockholders . On the Strike Decision Of the strike action the editorial says : " In the end they presented the management with a twenty-four-hour ultimatum , and called a strike when the management replied that it would give its answer within three days . " The strike decision resulted because , within the twenty-four hours , the corporation gave not so much as a hint that it would accept , or even consider , arbitration on the union 's terms or on any other terms . The union 's conference of delegates correctly took this to mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to negotiate the issues of the dispute , that the corporation also rejected arbitration . Your editorial of Nov. 22 apparently was written in the expectation that the corporation would accept arbitration , in principle at least . Unfortunately , GM did not come through as you expected . The union delegates had a better knowledge of what they were up against . They read the GM reply of Nov. 20 as a refusal of arbitration . The GM reply of Nov. 23 refused arbitration . Most damaging to the cause of industrial peace and to the prospect for post-war prosperity is the characterization in this editorial of the union 's demand for maintaining take-home pay . The editorial says that the workers are " in effect asking that they should be paid ( and at time-and-a-half rates ) for eight hours for which they did not work . " The union believes that maintenance of wartime take-home pay and the forty-hour week are necessary ( 1 ) to provide every worker 's family with highest possible purchasing power so that it can help provide the markets for , and share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ( 2 ) 4 to make job opportunities for all returning service men and for all unemployed war workers . This objective stands four-square with every plan for full employment and sustained prosperity that we have seen . The Committee for Economic Development , which is a business , not a labor organization , bases its hopes for stable post-war industry upon a forty-hour week and upon high takehome pay for the forty hours worked , Every Government analysis of postwar prospects we know of likewise assumes a forty-hour week and high take-home pay for the forty hours . When your editorial describes this as a demand for pay for hours not worked , a distortion results . Within our history there was a time when workers worked eighty hours a week for $15 . That was at a rate of $7.50 for forty hours of work . Would THE NEW YORK TIMES now say that a worker who works forty hours for $50 is being paid $42.50 for the forty hours he does not work ? Does it ignore the proof which war gave us of our true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has always made by paying more for fewer hours of work has come to an end , and there can be no further step forward ? Your Topics of The Times in this same issue provided an answer to this question . It said : " It will not be news to the general public that the quantity of goods produced in this country has shown an enormous increase since the beginning of the century . A study by the National Bureau of Economic Research , summarized in this paper the other day , puts the volume of production in the year 1939 at three times the output in 1899 . Neither will it be news that the wage-earner 's individual output during this period has also gone up . The worker now produces twothirds more than he did formerly , so that in 1939 it needed only four men for every seven in 1899 to produce the aforesaid 1939 volume of three times the 1899 output . Settlement Sought " And finally , it will not be news that this impressive increase in total production and individual productivity has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 per cent . This means that a fifty-five-hour week in 1899 will have come down to a forty-four-hour week in 1939 . " In conclusion the editorial says , " * there is a great deal for the President and Congress to do  --  and undo . " GM President C. E. Wilson similarly has revealed that he looks to Congress for settlement of his dispute with the union . What can Mr. Wilson and this editorial refer to ? Is it a law , that would outlaw strikes ? Is it a law that would require workers to work for a wage fixed by law , ea starve ? Is it a law to compel men to work against their will ? May I suggest that you re-examine the reasonable and American character of the demand which this union hoe made upon the corporation . I am nut ready to believe that any responsiblit newspaper would prefer , in its stem the determination of wages by b or by force of arms  --  if that is the editorial in its closing line is seeks1 ing to suggest . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issni# settled on the basis of the economi4 facts , not on the basis of econzree power . The corporation rejected resort to the facts . The union will welcome any suitable means of settling the issue on the basis of facts , providing it shall be binding upon the corporation and the union alike . WALTER P. REUTHER , Vice President , UAW-CIO . Detroit , Mich. , Nov. 26 , 1945 . Editorial comment on this letter appears elsewhere on this page . Courses for Stupid Parents To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORE TIMES Your correspondent in the issue of Dec. 1 who desires the punishment of parents for the misdoings of their children is right only in part , in my opinion . Sometimes there are children in a family who will not profit even by the best training , where one or more will be obedient and cooperative . The punishment of parents after their children have gone astray does not undo the evil wrought and would but double the expense to the state . I would suggest classes in education for the responsibilities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that purpose , where young and old may learn the art of making home life interesting and attractive , for where thoughtful consideration and intelligent unselfishness abound , happiness follows . Unremitting , wise supervision is essential in the forming of good habits , the parents , of course , setting the example of good behavior , a sort of " education by contagion , " as the great Dr. Jowett put it . Self-control and a sense of humor are crime preventives  --  even the cleverest criminals eventually discover their own stupidity if they live long enough , and irresponsible parents are certainly the most stupid of all .
