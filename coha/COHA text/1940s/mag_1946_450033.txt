rist ' Columbia is supposed to be one of the few places left in North America where the timber wolf still exists in fair-sized numbers . But when we ask the Indians about wolves they all say : ? ? ? " By gosh , lots of wolf . Mebbe some day you see him , but not much I think . Wolf very wise , just like ma I think you neber see him in sticks forest , only , prn country ? sometimes . " l'he ? ' ve told us various anecdotes which point to t remarkable intelligence on the part of the wolves : their cleverness in avoiding traps , in hunting moose , bac they follow human beings for miles , how they are able to distinguish an armed man from an unarmed with whom they are distinctly bolder , ? and so on . Though the Indians respect the wolves , apparently they are n't much afraid of them . They tan cite no cases of men having been attacked by sties , although wolves sometimes kill their dogs .

Although they 're primarily flesh eaters , wolves evidently do not like human flesh . Bodies of men who have died in the wilderness are cleaned invariably by maggots and various insects , not by wolves or coyotes . " Do wolves over come around Tetana or the Driftwood River ? " we asked . " Oh , yes , lots , some-limes . Pretty soon you see tracks , mebbe . " , But it was not until February that we found any fresh signs . Then , as we were taking a snowshoe ramble a quarter of a mile from the cabin , we came suddenly on new wolf tracks , so big that J. , who is familiar with the smaller wolves of the Arctic , whistled loudly . The prints of a single foot measured five to six inches across . The tracks are more numerous now each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunting all over this territory , or whether they mean that the actual numbers of wolves are increasing , we have no means ' of telling . The snow , although much more solid than in December , is still so soft in most places that their long legs sink far below the surface , and it must take considerable strength for them to plow their way through . A mile and a half northeast of Tetana is Wolf Lake , newly christened by us because it appears to be a favorite haunt of the wolves . It is a deep , narrow little stretch of water , bordered east and west by high hills and cliffs . The hill on the west sticks up from the surrounding country like a giant camel hump and is higher and more open than any other hill within miles . One of our favorite trails leads to the top , where we can look over the whole Driftwood Valley and view six great mountain ranges . The wolves come down the high lake bank on the northeast , making long wide slides in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface in every direction . They also frequently climb to our pet lookouts on the hill . Last night , February 15 , we heard the love song of the wolf ! There had been fresh snow followed by clear sky and a full brilliant moon . Our thermometer stood at 24 below . I proposed a snowshoe hike to Wolf Hill on the chance that we might be able to observe wolves down on the lake . J. scouted the notion of actually seeing them , but the night was so beautiful that he could n't resist the idea any more than I could . We stepped out in a dazzling world . At least a foot of powdery new snow covered the firm six-foot snow level and made ideal snowshoeing . We traveled swiftly and silently through silver glens and black shadows . Our snowshoes kicked up feathery clouds that twinkled like quicksilver . Our breath froze over jackets and caps and hair so that we were dressed from head to toe in white crystals . When we reached the top of Wolf Hill , all below us spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moon for a hundred miles , still and primeval as in the days before the few men who know it now had ever seen it . Belts of dark forest were interspersed with willow swamps which , deeply buried , lay like open fields brushed with gold . To the south the mountains of Takla were faint blue in the distance . The jagged , tumbled Frypans jutted like silver spearheads into the deep amethyst , star-studded sky .. The Driftwoods , our own mountains , lay serene and golden , so close that we could almost reach out and touch them . The glacial-covered range far behind to the west showed distinctly , and the Bear Lake Mountains stood sharp and shining all round the northern horizon . Finally we moved across to the east side where a rock precipice falls down to Wolf Lake , crisscrossed with fresh black tracks , and looked on the miles of forested hills that rise gradually to the rolling Ominecas . Utter silence , a deathlike hush over the land ; and then , from somewhere below , came a sound that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind , rising slowly , softly , clearly to a high , lovely note of sadness and longing ; dying down on two distinct notes so low that our human ears could scarcely catch them . It rose and died , again and again . A wolf singing the beauty of the night , singing it as no human voice had ever done , calling on a mate to share the beauty of it with him , to come to him , to love him . Over and over it sang , so tenderly and exquisitely that it seemed as if the voice were calling to me and I could hardly keep from crying . The whole wilderness was musical with it . After an interval , from far across the eastern hills came a soft , distinct , answering call . Three times more the wolf below us sang and was answered . Gradually the other voice grew nearer and nearer , until we thought that the two must have come together , for the sudden quiet was not broken again . Then I knew that I was shivering like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grasping , was almost paralyzed . J. was saying : " Gad , what luck ! What marvelous luck ! I 've heard wolves howling in India and the Arctic , but I never heard the like of that ! Let 's go home ? if we 're not too cold to move . " On the west , Wolf Hill slopes steeply , almost perpendicularly , for several hundred feet and is clear of trees . Spurred to recklessness by the height of our emotions , we did something that we 've never dared to do before . We sat on the crossed heels of our snowshoes and tobogganed down the icy slope at terrific speed . Powdered snow flew up in clouds and turned to rainbows where the moon shone through it . That we arrived , unscathed , in a drift below , instead of being smashed to bits against trees , was just a part of the magic of the night . We reached the warm cabin after midnight , stoked up a roaring fire , and drank scalding cocoa . I hardlyremember getting into heel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . I could hear a wolf calling and singing and sobbing in a voice of exquisite ten . derness. 2 BESTIAL is a commonly accepted term used by human beings to describe the very lowest type of human behavior . I dislike this . To say that bad 11101 are like beasts is an insult to the beasts . I doula whether animals are capable of the rottenness of which some men are capable . Possibly because man ' has risen higher in his mental powers he is able . therefore , to sink lower . But this greater mental ability , and power to reason , should make low behavior on man 's part far less excusable than no behavior in an animal . The Indians of these regions agree will , the scientists who say that in general wolves remain mated for life ; a habit of behavior far above that of the domestic dog , which is notably promiscuous , and incidentally above a large percentage of human he . ings . The male and female wolf may be separated for a time each year , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or spring . Wolves have been following us , even coming with . in three hundred yards of the cabin . They use our snowshoe trails and we 've found places where they must have stood behind bushes as we went by . Careful examination of their tracks indicates that they were made at the same time ours were , and the Indians , who seem to be almost infallible at trail reading , have confirmed this . J. finds the power and endurance of the woke remarkable . ' Once , for twenty-seven miks , he trailed two wolves that were breaking trail without a stop . Over the first twenty-two miles the bigger tracks were partly obscured by the smaller one . Then the larger wolf moved to one side , with no perceptible change of pace , and dropped behind the smaller one . The snow was some six feet deep and quite soft . The trail of the wolves was a shallop trough sixteen inches wide and a foot deep , will ' foot and leg tracks going still deeper . The leading wolf simply pushed its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are thickest . Sometimes we find places where the wolves have dug up mice or lemmings . But in deep snow , the light snowshoe rabbit can usually evade the heavy wolf . Grouse , too , can not be stalked easily by an animal that sinks to the belly or lower with every step . The D10050 , whose weight fore 's them to travel very slowly with bent forelegs , is the animal that can be hunted by wolves most successfully at this season . We 've seen wolf trails leading through the forest near a moose yard where the moose feed on tall dead grasses under thick spruces . Here the ground is sometimes almost bare . Evidently the moose , a. long as they keep in shallow snow , are n't often attacked . When the moose has firm footing , hoofs are deadly . Though hunting moose his time must be a necessity for the wolves , it nwxt also be a precarious business . From a son-in-law of Bear Lake Charlie , J. has bifilofi t he skull and skin of a beautiful , large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This wolf . with terrific wounds , broken ribs , and two shattend legs , had stood at bay against a tree surrounded by moose tracks , blood , and moose hair . Ile hail been crippled in a great battle . Although ? ter ? ? sick , according to the Indian , he fought his next , enemy , the man , fiercely and bravely , never yielding an inch . until a merciful shot at last ended his life . The Indians have told us of similar cases in which a single wolf has attacked a moose . But in general , die wolves attack in families , outrun the moose , and surround it . They leap at the legs to hamstring them and force the moose down , when they finish it by tearing at the throat . This process has been described to us by Charlie , Sapolio , Michelle , and a plane pilot , all of whom claim to have seen it on open lakes or swamps . It must be a fierce and thrilling business . On Sapolio 's last visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month ) , he told us that six or eight miles north of Tetana , five moose have been recently killed by wolves . The moose are about a mile apart and very little of them has as yet been eaten . But Sapolio declares that later the wolves will return and finish each one off to the last scrap and bone . He says they never waste any . One ca n't feel anger at the wolves . They do not , like sportsmen , kill for the sake of killing , but for food . Unlike man , they apparently never waste meat or kill unless necessary . So far we have not found any instances or heard of any kills which have been made and then neglected . Every scrap of the dead animal , except the fur , is eventually eaten by the wolves . Even the fur is put to good use by squirrels , mice , and birds in nest building . We have also heard reports of wolf bands having licia seen on Bear Lake , and in the open plateau notary farther north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossing Bear Lake . In the first they counted thirty-one ; in the other , fifteen . Scientists disagree as to the numbers of individual wolves in a company . The Indians here consider thirty in one group to be not especially large . Several trappers of the Hudson Bay country told J. of counting two hundred or more arctic wolves together in one launch . On one occasion , J. himself counted a hundred and sixty-seven following a large herd of caribou . 3 J. HAS made one thorough attempt to trap a wolf here , in order to obtain a specimen for the British Colombia Provincial Museum , to which all our specimens are going . ' He had n't much hope of success after what we 'd heard from the experienced Indian hunters , the most clever of whom are not able apparently to catch wolves except on rather rare occasions . But last week he put a big Number 3 steel trap on a point along the shore of Wolf Lake . Here the wolves that travel over the ice invariably go out of.their way to sprinkle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? he would n't let me come anywhere near that end of the lake . He wore gloves and concealed the trap with snow , and covered his own snowshoe prints completely as he back tracked away . Late that afternoon there was a wind , very unusual here in winter , and when we went back to Wolf Lake next day J. 's tracks , and the trap set , and all human signs were completely obliterated by hard-blown snow . New wolf tracks , made in the night or early morning , were all across the lake , but for the first time they made a wide circle around their customary stopping place . Nor have they ever gone near the point since the trap was put there , though they continue to frequent Wolf Lake and Wolf Hill as much as ever . I 'm glad ! It has made me sick to think of catching some wolf with a beautiful voice , perhaps the very one we listened to on that wonderful night . It made J. sick too , for he finally took up the trap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indians . It 's interesting to me to watch the transformation in J. 's views about trapping and hunting . Although he has trapped in the Arctic and been a more than successful hunter of big game . he now strongly dislikes trapping the larger mammals , or killing them , except in cases of necessity . From boyhood he has been crazy about wild things , but since he has begun to study their lives and habits , he has acquired such a feeling for them as individuals that the desire to take life from them has become more and more distasteful . If we feel a strong repugnance for the trapping of the smaller mammals like marten and mink and beaver , how much more strongly do we feel it in the case of creatures as highly developed as the wolves . There are various authentic instances , reported by reputable scientists and hunters , which show dial wolves which have been caught in traps for a few days , or even hours , although in superb physical condition and very little hurt , died in a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from any physical injury . The expression in the eyes of these wolves and their whole appearance have been so heart-rending that even the most hardened hunters have expressed wonder and pity . We have seen a dozen or so wolf pelts at the trading posts , but apparently most of these wolves Occasional Papers of the British Columbia l'rovineial Museum , Number 4 , May , 1943 , " Some Accounts of the Flora and Fauna of the Driftwood Valley Region of North Central British Columbia , " by John F. and Theodora C. Stanwell-fletcher. had been killed with a gun in open country farther north or south of the Driftwood and Bear Lake regions . Some of the pelts were eight feet long from nose tip to tail tip , though the majority were six to seven feet . The larger wolves were said to weigh around 130 pounds . There was a remarkable variation in color . They were gray-white , blue-gray , yellow , and sometimes all black . The occasional talk about an actual extermination of wolves here or in Alaska , on the ground that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game animals left , fills us with helpless wrath . Control of certain so-called predators , or bad individuals , in restricted localities , is one thing ; extermination of a whole race or species is another . Long before man , himself the greatest predator of them all , came on the scene , wolves and big game ? the deer and moose and caribou ? existed in apparently healthy proportion side by side . You have only to examine certain areas in the United States where cougars and bobcats and wolves have been exterminated to see what has happened to the deer : overpopulation of the range , consequent overgrazing , and decimation of disease-ridden animals no longer kept down in the proper proportion by their natural enemies who generally destroyed the unfit and left the strong . It would seem from the facts that man , in this , as in so many other respects , is not able to improve on Nature . Moreover , by what right does man , who , . after all , forms only one small branch of all the great world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it must prey for its livelihood on other live things , shall no longer exist ? Man who , himself , as William James puts it , ? biologically considered . . . is the most formidable of all the beasts of prey , and indeed the only one that preys systematically on his own species . " Here there is another factor which helps to safeguard the wolves . This is a superstition or taboo that prevents certain Indians of this region from killing or catching wolves . We do n't clearly understand why this taboo applies to some Indians and not to others , nor how strictly it prevents them from obtaining wolf pelts if opportunity offers . Bear Lake Charlie is one of the tribe who dares not kill a wolf . This applies to his sons , except Michelle , the oldest , who is the inheritor on the maternal side , and whose mother , Selina , does not belong to the wolf taboo company . " The gun that kills a wolf , " Charlie told us , " will one day kill a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And my boys , only Michelle , can not kill the wolf . " It is interesting that this traditional respect for wolves , the taboo against killing them , and various other ideas are found among these North American Indians as well as among the ancient peoples of India and Europe . Perhaps all this has arisen partly from inherited fear and partly from admiration for an animal whose brains and personality have for centuries successfully contested man and his ways . Alan 's respect for the wolf conies from knowledge of the wolf 's character and strength ; the taboos may be a sop to man 's ego . IT WAS after three years in the Driftwood Valley , just as we were about to take our departure , that there occurred the adventure with wolves for which we had longed , but which we never dared to dream would actually happen . We had acquired during our first year in the wilderness two beloved comrades and helpers ? Wahoo , a hundred-pound pack dm , and Rex , a pure-bred Alsatian . Later , for the sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranges , we also obtained two fine pack horses . One afternoon late in mid-August J. and I were surprised to hear a tremendous chorus of covet0 barely half a mile away from our cabin . Their shrill barks were mingled with a few smooth wolf howls . The noise waxed louder and louder until eventually the wolves drowned out the coyotes . What in the world had happened to call them forth and make them give voice so lustily at this season , and so near our cabin ? Seizing cameras and guns , we hurried off . When we had gone only a little distance , the noise was shut off with sudden and complete abruptness , and we could find no trace of wolves in the thick spruce and swamps next the river . A few well-posted sentries had obviously announced our start and progress and , at the proper moment , bid the others shut down . When we got back to the cabin , J. prepared to pole up the river in the skiff , thinking that a more roundabout and silent approach might yield better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us on such a dangerous trip , and as the horses had to be watered and taken to the meadow for the night , I , alas , had to be the one to stay home and attend to evening chores . Later , leading the horses , with Item and 1Vahoo running ahead , 11 was halfway to the meadow when I heard wolves howling again ? no coyotes this time ? from the same direction over by the river , and I wondered anxiously if J. had reached his destination in time . After a laborious hour of hunting for two places where Baldy and Lassie could find a sulliciem quantity of the late grass and would not get tangled in bushes , I tied them both . I was just leaving , with many an anxious backward glance , hoping they would be safe , when Wahoo , chasing Rex in a wild game of tag , barged into me from behind and knocked my Irgs clean out from under me . One knee must have hen put almost out of joint , for it hurt frightfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with Wallis huge pink tongue darting out contrite kisses from above , I heard a loud shot from J. 's big rifle . llus scared me stiff , for I knew that he would shoot only if he was being attacked . I thought at once of a grizzly . The spot where I supposed J. to be was , as the crow flies , a mile and a half from the cabin . To get there by boat it was necessary , after leaving the lake outlet , to turn northwestward up the river and follow the shallow rapids , deep eddies , and winding willow-bordered stream to a V-shaped bend , where tall spruce hid the mountains on one side and dense willows overhung the bank on the other . At the shot , the wolf chorus had stopped dead . I was just starting toward home when , on the still sunset air , there came a sound that made me cold and almost stopped my heart . It was the horrible , low , wailing moan of something or someone in mortal agony . It sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home when , after a terrible operation , he had been wheeled up from the operating room . Could it be the cry of a wolf ? If a wolf , it was unlike RI1V wolf note I 'd ever heard before , and I thought I had run the gamut of all wolf noises . In the gathering dusk I limped slowly along the path , stopping now and then to rub my knee and listen . Just as I reached the cabin the cry came toxin , repeated twice . This time , because it was nearer , it was even more horrible . And then , most larrifying of all , the loud , wailing , always musical thorns of wolf voices began again . They had not even been scared off by the shot . Were they singing over J. 's dead or mangled body ? I 'd had a faint hope that during the hour 's I 'd been eine J. might have returned , but the cabin was dark and empty . There was not a sign of him or the boat . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerve for some sound of J. , for it was so dark I could no longer see . The howling of the wolves , so near and loud and triumphant and continuous , unnerved ale eoinpletely . The dogs , by this time thoroughly irirdnened by nay fright , crouched beside me . When I was n't listening , I know I was praying . It was nineL thirty . At ten I would start out through the big swamps toward the river and the wolves . And then , one down the lake , came a faint creak . It stopped . I had only imagined it . It came again , clear and unmistakable , the creak of oars . It was J. He was safe . When , tired , hungry , and exalted , J. reached the bank , he found , to his consternation , two frantic dogs and his wife , that weak and silly creature , drowned in tears , sobbing incoherently ! 5 Tuts was the story he recounted : He had hurried town the lake and out through the outlet into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current and trying to do it quietly . By the time he got up , t here was n't a sound of the wolves , but there were downs of wolf tracks , newly made , along the shore and sand bar . The river was thick with kokanee salmon . Some were dead . J. waited an hour or so by a hank under thick willows . And then a black bear , with its rub , came from bushes on the opposite shore forty feet away . For a few minutes they caught kokanees in shallow water , catching them up in their mouths and swallowing them at a gulp . The light was very bad . It did n't look as though J. could get a thing , but he was going to take some feet with the movie , anyhow , when suddenly he saw a big gray-black wolf standing in the middle of the river . How he got there J. did n't know . ( " He just appeared , that 's all ! " ) He looked twice the size of Wahoo and must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared at each other for a minute ; then they turned away and began to hunt fish " as unconcerned as you please . " After a bit the wolf saw the boat about thirty feet away . He stood like a statue ( " Gad , what a sight ! " ) and then he loped slowly ? he did n't seem to hurry ? and smoothly and gracefully off across the river and disappeared in the willows . Daylight was going fast by then , but J. could see the willows shaking in places . There was something moving behind them . Then they were still and the bears had gone too ? just melted off ? and there was n't a sound anywhere . And right then wolves began to sing in the willows just opposite . There must have been ten or twelve of them , judging from the noise and different voices . They did n't move around , just kept still and sang . Each outburst was started by one wolf , who had the lowest and most dirge-like note J. ever heard . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up straight ! Do n't believe anyone ever heard what I heard - that close . " And he had parked the boat just below the opening of a game trail ! It was covered up with hanging willows and he 'd never seen the trail at all . It was almost dark when there was a crash above , and there was a grizzly and its cub just about to climb down on him . Apparently they had no idea that J. was there ? perhaps his scent was carried away under the bank . He fired just over their heads ( " The flash must have singed ' em " ) and they were scared stiff and backed off in a hurry . If they 'd gone one foot farther they would n't have been able to turn back and would have been down right on top of him . " Jumping Joseph ! " J. said . " Was I scared ! And I thought that all this would have scared off the wolves , but blest if they did n't start singing again right away , softly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ( must have been the one that scared you ? it sure had the most hair-raising notes I ever heard ) set ' em off and they were at it as loud as ever . Must have known I was there all along and were n't a bit scared of me . Ca n't understand it ! If you were scared hearing ' em a mile away , you ought to have been right beside ' em . I tell you it was all I could do to keep my nerve up . Never thought of moving or starting home till about half an hour later , though I 'd meant to get down before it got pitch-dark . Do n't believe anyone on earth has heard what I did . If you 'd only been there ? " For days after this we explored up and down the river , and found signs of wolves and bears and coyotes and lesser . animals everywhere . They were one and all making the most of the kokanee run and enjoying a regular fish banquet . Around sundown , and soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls of the wolves . Sometimes near-by , sometimes far off . The loud horse bells and the barking of the dogs did not seem to scare them in the least . But we never heard the high , fierce hunting chorus typical of late winter and early spring . In summer , when food is so much more easily obtained , the wolves seldom need to join forces in order to hunt . Intent on getting pictures , J. twice more tried the same spot up the river but never saw a wolf . At last he fixed on our favorite fishing pool a half mile down the river from Tetana . Numerous tracks on the wide gravel and sand bars by the pool indicated that this was frequented by the wolves ; and a deep , still backwater , bordered on one side by willows , would , we thought , make an excellent parking place for the boat . 6 So , nearly every morning for several weeks , J. has got up before 3.00 A.M. and , loaded with cameras , guns , and a thermos of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to be well established by daybreak . He has always stuck it out until late morning , sometimes noon or afternoon , when he returns almost too tired to be able to tumble into bed . I 'Ve spent hours trying to straighten out the cramps which , after he 's been sitting still for six or ten hours at a stretch , have attacked him in every limb . But his perseverance has been amply rewarded , for at least half the time he has seen wolves face to face ! He has taken hundreds of feet of moving pictures , some of which we can only pray may be good . The wolves have appeared nearly always in the early morning when light has been poor and the river full of mist . The weather , too , though it has not actually rained , has been overcast rather than bright . The early mornings have been cold , with the thermometer clown to 18 and 15 degrees . J. has proved that here in this region , during certain seasons , fish form the wolves ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have reported that wolves not only spend some t ime getting fish in the rivers when the runs arc on , but also come around the large lakes when dead bodies of the big sockeyes are beginning to line the shores . 1 have just been out of luck , for the few occasions when I 've gone with .1 . have been the very times when the wolves did not appear . Being cramped up in the tiny boat with .1 . was bad , not only because it 's dangerous going down and up river , but where there is just room enough for one person to stretch his legs in order to avoid serious cramps , two can hardly move at all . And , though we 've considered it , my going alone has seemed a bit too risky and foolhardy . Um not strong enough fn manage the boat safely on the river ; and going by boat is the only way to reach the parking spot where one can get , a clear view of the sand bar which the wolves frequent . So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 've heard plenty ! We seem to be surrounded by wolves that have , for the time being , taken up their abode in the Tetami territory . Though the real song choruses are in the evenings and early mornings , at almost any time of the day or night we can hear howls and yawns from young and old . When I walk with Rex and Wahoo . I am certain that sometimes wolves walk with us . There is a slight stirring of bushes and when I go to look at the spot , a little hesitantly and fearfully , hut quite unable to resist , there is moss springing slowk up from the depression made by a heavy foot , or there are big fresh droppings , or a sprinkle on a log not yet dried . And there is a very strong smell , not a dog smell ! Rex and Wahoo must see the wolves , for th0i. often come back to me all ruffled and bristling , just : r ; though they 'd encountered another dog . I wonder what they all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , J .. has seen from his river parking plaice sixteen wolves at distances from fifteen to seventy-five feet . The very first morning , when he had sat shivering for two hours after dawn . it spot in the pool about thirty feet off , which had been still and empty , suddenly held a gray wolf . Ile woe standing knee-deep with a flapping little kokanee in his mouth . How he got there J. did n't know , because he supposed his own eyes had been glued to the pool every minute . The boat moved a trifle and the wolf saw it instantly . For a second he was motionless : then lie lowered his head eight inches and the hairs on his shoulders rose stiffly . In another second , he . fore J. even had time to start the camera , he had loped away . For three more mornings J. saw nothing , and then on the fourth , a large yellowish wolf appeared on the gravel bar . It moved to the water 's edge without e sound , gliding along with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows to be characteristic of wolves . It pounced on a little kokanee and then , in the slight sound of the camera , stopped dead . The head lowered and the ruff stood up straight . J. ire stantly stopped the camera , the wolf relaxed a little : a single movement of a cramped finger and he wase On other mornings three more wolves came , but the light was much too weak for pictures . They all appeared silently and were , as usual , well out into the open before J. was even aware of their presence . They vanished as silently , stepping always over the small stones of the gravel bar as though they walked on broken glass . From the Omincca Mountains J. brought home the fatty linings of several goat stomachs . These had no been touched except with sterilized rubber gloves . One morning , as he drifted by in the boat , he dropped three pieces on the gravel bar . At four-fificen a wadi appeared . With head low , moving from side ' to side , it looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earefoll x away into the willows and vanished .

J. had the impression that . she was quite old and without young . She paused to sprinkle on the sand and then , moving leisorel ) up the gravel bar , she stopped several times to catch a kokanee struggling in the shallows . Without apparently having scented a fresh piece of goat stomach . put there that morning , she came on it suddenly and ate it without hesitation . After which , he went to the river again and caught three more kokanee in rapid succession . A few minutes later she vanished , but returned in brawn minutes or so , examined the place where the bait had been , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of wolves , possibly a family gathering , began a song near-by . There were voices of young pups ? high quavery notes ? striving to compete with the louder , more mellow ones of the elders . On hearing them the black wolf waded across a little rapid to within twenty feet of J. , leaped up the bank . which was only three feet high at that point , and sat down in tall grass . Just a vague outline of her body showed ; and she began to sing in a low , vibrating dirge . She sat there for nearly an hour , sometimes quiet , sometimes singing mournfully . Then she jumped down into the water and , approaching to within fifteen feet of the boat , submerged her head to the shoulders to catch a fish . A moment later she heard the camera going , and for several minutes she and J. stared at each other . Iler wonderful golden eyes were wide and unblinking . These , with the white and gray whiskers of her muzzle , were the only touches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned slowly , forded the river to the gravel bar , stood where the bait had been , and once more , with those wonderful unfathomable eyes of hers , looked long at J. , who , with hands shaking from cold and excitement , ' was trying to expose as much film as possible . 7 131 . kugust ' 20 only a- few live kokanee were left in the river . The run this year occurred earlier than usual , possibly owing to the exceptionally early flood season . The fish seemed to have been mostly picked lip , nail Only one or two here and there still struggled in shallow pools . Some days went by without J. 's seeing any wolves , though we heard them occasionally . Bears crashed around in search of berries . We saw an otter in the river below the lake , and two coyotes . Also large numbers of muskrats . Then again , for several days in succession , J. wa tithed some wolf pups . One was a young male , well-fed and strong , about the size and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He moved slowly but gracefully , and with an air of abandon , just like a cat . Approaching within thirty feet of the camera , he saw the boat and stopped , leaped back a dozen yards , and then sat down to watch . After a few urinates he came on again , head lowered , cars pricked forward . Ile sat down again and peered this way and that , head low , then high . staring at the boat with the greatest interest . He was cute enough to hug . J. said " Hello ! " and he bounced in the air . For a while he played hide-and-seek with J. , in and out of the willows , once interrupting the game for a good long scratch . Then he vanished in the bushes and began to circle the boat . Three times his head peeked out at different places . Several days later J. saw twice what Ire was sure was the same pup . On the last occasion he was amused and almost chagrined at the little wolf 's complete disregard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happily until a call , which must have been from home , came from ' way down the river , and off he ran into the forest . One day , farther down the river , J. also watched another wolf pup who was much thinner and more timorous than the cute little fat one . Ever since we began to be aware of the constant presence of wolves and bears , we 've kept the horses belled and tied up at night on the east grassy marsh of Tetana . But even the loud ringing of big bells , plus Wahoo 's big voice , does n't scare the wolves . Instead it is likely to start them off on a mighty and thrilling chorus , exactly as a big company of Husky dogs gives voice at the evening ringing of the mission bell in a little Arctic settlement . J. and I have pooled our ideas about these wild comrades of ours . We have come to the conclusion that the wolves are well aware of our presence and habits , and like us ! They even allow their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of understanding , they have apparently come to realize that there is nothing to fear from us , that we like them , that we are interested in their welfare . Not only do we hear and see them down the river a mile away to the south , but we hear them from the west toward the log jam , from the north around the meadow , from the east toward Trail Lake . They have shown no sign of harming us , , our dogs , or our horses . It seems a fitting fulfilhnent of our greatest desires that the most intelligent of our wilderness companions have reached this basis of tolerance toward us . They are beginning to understand that the Tetana area can be a place where man and beast may live side by side , unhampered one by the other , respecting one another 's rights and habits ; and realize that there is room for us all so long as we are fair and just and keep the laws of the wild .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
