The Nazis seemed last week to be planning an extraordinary new radio coup . Fortnight ago they released tall , bald , bespectacled Funnyman Pelham Grenville Wodehouse from an internment camp at Tost , ensconced him at Government expense in a suite in Berlin 's swank Hotel Adlon , gave him permission to come and go as he pleased within the confines of the Reich . During his captivity , 59-year-old Author Wodehouse , who was captured when he tarried too late at a cocktail party at his villa in Le Touquet in May 1940 , was rated a model prisoner . But on a quid pro quo basis good conduct seemed hardly enough to warrant such great generosity from the Nazis . Then its logic appeared . <P> Interviewed in Berlin , Author Wodehouse announced that he would shortly take to the air , by arrangement with the German Foreign Office , to relate to U.S. listeners his personal experiences . Said he : " There will be np politics . ... I never have been able to work up a belligerent feeling . Just as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet some nice fellow from it and lose all my belligerency . " To this small clue as to his state of mind , Wodehouse added another : " Naturally I hope the war is over soon , but if I am able to continue my work I will be satisfied . " He wondered whether his world was ended , evinced no convictions or aspirations about the world to come . <P> Inferring that the Nazis were at least going to use Wodehouse as a come-on for their . shortwave propaganda broadcasts , the British press bustled . Front-paged the London Daily Mirror : " Wodehouse . . . lived luxuriously here because Britain laughed with him , but when the laughter was out of his country 's heart , Wodehouse was not ready to share her sufferings . ... " Commented the Daily Express ' subacid Columnist Paul Holt : " Wodehouse is one of the best loved Englishmen alive , but he is now using quite a short spoon to sup with the devil . . . . Life in hell is good to live , I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "
