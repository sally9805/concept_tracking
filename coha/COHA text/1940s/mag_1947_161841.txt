At noon , with the sun blazing down , Australia 's best bowler let go with the first ball . It zipped in nearly as fast as a baseball pitch ( about 65 m.p.h. ) , hit the ground just in front of the batsman , where he would have to hit it on the pickup . England 's lead-off man blocked it off to one side . The fourth of the Test Matches , the World Series of cricket , was on . <P> <P> For six days , thousands of Australians jammed into the green-turfed oval at Adelaide . The happenings there last week made mere squibs in most U.S. newspapers , but they brought passionate growls from all over Britain and headlines in Shanghai and Johannesburg . <P> To many Americans who do n't know what they are talking about , cricket is a British eccentricity hardly less pansy than croquet . Americans condemn the game because it moves too leisurely , has too much ritualistic etiquette , and the players actually knock off for tea at 4 o'clock . One ex-G.I. who had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York we 'd have thrown pop bottles just to wake things up . " <P> But in London last week , a considerable fraction of the population rose from warm beds and sat shivering beside wirelesses to hear the 7 a.m. news report of the Battle of Adelaide . A blue-faced cabby with frosted eyebrows said to a chum : " We did n't ought to have sent them . " In a swank Pall Mall club , an elderly gentle man turned from the ticker mumbling : " Damn bad luck . " All England knew and feared the name of Australia 's great batsman , a wiry stockbroker , Don Bradman . With his help , last week , the Australian eleven held the British to a draw . The Australians had already won two and tied one , so ( though there was a fifth match to play ) the English had no chance of coming out even . London 's sensitive press complained about Australia 's Turkish-bath weather , " fit only for Nubian slaves . " <P> All but the Irish . In the imperial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there would have been no Irish problem if the Irish could have been induced to learn the game ) . And , contrary to U.S. curbstone opinion , cricket is not to be confused with croquet . <P> Though the ball is about the size and hardness of a baseball , none of the fielders wears gloves except the wicket keeper ( catcher ) , whose gloves resemble a hockey player 's gloves , with less padding . Batsmen wear leg pads something like a hockey goalie 's , and thumb and finger guards . When cricket immortals like the late , great , bearded William Gilbert ( " W.G. " ) Grace smote the ball , it practically tore a fielder 's hand off . <P> A Nottinghamshire miner named Harold Larwood caused an international incident in 1933 with " body-line bowling " : he tried to knock down Australian batsmen with beanballs , and sometimes succeeded . ( The Australian Government complained to Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald . ) There is no foul line , so batsmen can hit in all directions . In placing fielders to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move a man up as close as ten feet from the batsman , in suicidal positions known as " silly leg " and " silly mid on . " Cricket moves at less than half the pace of baseball , but-say its partisans - demands more science and judgment .
