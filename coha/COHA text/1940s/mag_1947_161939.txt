As Texas farmers began threshing the greatest winter wheat crop in U.S. history this week , the news for the world 's hungry was good . Best estimates place the crop at 1.3 billion bushels , more than double any average prewar year . But the chances of starting the wheat on its way promptly are worse than ever . Fewer boxcars are available than in the worst war years . In the Texas Panhandle , farmers are already scouting around for circus tents to cover the grain on the ground until the railroads can move it . As the harvesters move north in the next month , the car shortage will become worse . <P> The Association of American Railroads ordered Eastern and Western lines to deliver 1,600 cars a day to wheat-belt roads . That is well over the 1,200-a-day quota for last year , when wheat rotted on the ground . But there is no guarantee that the roads will get the 1,600 , as all are short of cars . Car production is still low . Manufacturers delivered an estimated 4,000 new freight cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every month the railroads , run flat-wheeled during the war , have been forced to retire more than 5,000 worn-out cars . Production of enough cars to alleviate the shortage-10,000 a month-will probably not be reached until September . ODT Director J. Monroe Johnson , who had blamed the carmakers ' low production on lack of steel last winter ( TIME , Feb. 24 ) now blames the car-builders . ( The car-builders still blame the steel shortage . ) All the wheat farmers can do is hope for dry weather . If they are lucky not too much wheat will rot in the fields .
