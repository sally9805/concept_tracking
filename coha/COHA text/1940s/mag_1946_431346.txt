 | Sometime during our lives almost all of us need an anesthetic , ' whether it be a mild shot of novocaine at the dentist 's or a general anesthetic for a major operation . We take anesthesia for granted , but we owe to it at the least our comfort , at the most perhaps our lives . The surgeon never would be able to work his miracles without the aid of anesthesia . Although few of us realize it , progress in surgery has gone hand in hand with the development of anesthesia . Not many years ago , a doctor could operate for only a relatively brief time ; thanks to present-day anesthetics he no longer is limited by the clock . He can take 4 or 5 hours for a chest operation , 6 or 8 hours for a brain operation . We can see the benefits in lower mortality rates . For instance , 10 years ago the best surgeons undertook chest operations with only a 50-50 chance that their patients might live ; today , with improved anesthesia , they take less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A British scientist , Sir Humphrey Davy , discovered the anesthetic properties of nitrous oxide ? laughing gas ? in 1799 , and doctors still use that agent . The first operation under anes hesia was performed in 1842 in Jefferson , Georgia , by D : . Crawford Long . Dr. Long used ether ? still the anesthetist 's standby . But medical science has learned a great deal about this subject in the past hundred years and , indeed , in the past decade . Doctors know how anesthetics act on the nervous system , the risks , and the way to avoid those risks . The nervous system , as we know . centers in the spinal cord and the brain . The nerve cells have a system similar to telephone lines , and impulses over the body travel those lines to the brain . Thus , if you hit your toe with a hammer , you do n't feel pain until the impulse has traveled to the level of consciousness , in your brain . Anesthesia , which makes a whack on your toe painless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the telephone line ? or interferes with the brain 's ability consciously to experience the whack . Thus you may have local or block anesthesia , both of which interfere with the conduction , or general anesthesia , which puts you to sleep . Until our grandfathers ' time ether and other general anesthetics were the only anesthesias developed . Only a few years before the turn of the century did scientists learn the use of local anesthetics . The first used was cocaine , and the first made artificially was novocaine . It @#  | still is the safest . Local anesthesia is the infiltration of novocaine into the area of the operation . This is simple , easy , and safe . Later , regional anesthesia was evolved . This is a nerve block , which renders surgery painless even though the patient remains conscious . The doctor can anesthetize any segment of the body . This type of anesthesia is especially important when the patient 's cooperation is needed . The spinal anesthetic is the most massive local anesthetic ? it anesthetizes the whole body below the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was used , doctors injected cocaine . Then they switched to the much safer novocaine . Nowadays the anesthetist injects into the spinal column often not one but two newer drugs . If the operation is to be long , he may use a continuous spinal drip . This is a new technique : the needle is inserted into the spine , and small doses of the anesthetic are given as needed . In some cases one dose is adequate ; in others a procession of small quantities is considered safest . Whatever the anesthesia ? local , block , or general ? the anesthetist has three objectives : First , he must render the operative procedure painless . Second , he must put you in a condition in which surgery can be accomplished most effectively . For the best surgery , you must be thoroughly relaxed and the area of the operation must be perfectly exposed . Third , you must not be damaged or harmed by the anesthetic . The anesthetist must restore you to consciousness in as healthy a state as you were before he put you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blame for disasters on the operating table that were due to faulty anesthesia . HEREIN reside the great advances in anesthesia : The cerebral cortex is composed of the most sensitive tissues of the body . It must have an adequate supply of oxygen at all times . If it does n't get sufficient oxygen , even for 3 to 5 minutes , changes occur that can not be reversed . The patient may emerge from the operation blind or deaf or paralyzed or enfeebled in mind , or he may die for lack of oxygen . Anesthetics tend to reduce the supply of oxygen to the brain , some more than others . The wonder of modern anesthesia is that it provides the surgeon with the relaxation and exposure he needs , for as long as he needs it , and still supplies the brain with sufficient oxygen . Local and block anesthesias are the safest , as we shall see presently . These types are used whenever possible . Many operations , however , such as abdominal operations , can be performed best under general anesthesia . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Early in the morning , before you are quite awake , a nurse gives you a hypodermic . Presently a man in a white coat comes in carrying an oddly shaped bottle . " I 'm Dr. Phillips , the anesthetist , " he introduces himself . " I have a cocktail for you . I call it a cocktail because ? " Apparently a moment later , you notice that he has gone and it 's one o'clock . You lost and later regained consciousness as swiftly as switching off and on a light . You never found out why he called it a cocktail . You did n't know when you went to the operating room . The operation is all over . You are fully conscious , just sleepy . As a matter of fact , you have been through three stages of anesthesia . The  | first was when you lost consciousness . You did n't know it , but you went on talking quite a while . The second is a period of excitement , possibly even delirium : you may talk , cry out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully , to keep you from falling or leaping out of bed or in some fashion hurting yourself . With some drugs this period is much shorter than with others , or may not appear at all . The third stage is that of surgical anesthesia . The anesthetist determines this when you do not try , when stimulated , to do anything for yourself . If he should put his finger down your throat , you would not gag . If he should open your eye , you would n't close it . There is a fourth stage , an even deeper level . This is the dangerous one at which respiration and heartbeat may cease . The anesthetist always strives to reach and maintain the third stage without ever approaching the fourth . To keep far from this fourth stage , Dr. Phillips gave you not one but four anesthetics . The hypodermic contained morphine . The " cocktail " was a drug called avertin , and was administered rectally . Later , in the operating room , he gave you ethylene-oxygen , a gas , and finally a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a combination of any 3 or 4 other drugs from a long list now available , selected to meet your special needs and the requirements of the surgery . Every type of operation and each patient present their problems . For instance , for typhoid operations the late Dr. Crile used to put his patients to sleep with gas and then operate under a local anesthetic . The reason for this multiple anesthesia ? one of the important new techniques ? is this : One big dose of any one drug may be toxic . If the anesthetist uses several drugs , he lessens the toxicity of each . THE newer , faster , pleasanter anesthesias are more difficult to handle for this and other reasons . Sodium pentothal , first evolved at the Mayo Clinic in 1934 , and cyclopropane , first used clinically in 1930 , are examples of the new anesthesias , which are amazing in the hands of trained anesthetists . They have many highly desirable characteristics , such as stability within the body , convenience in handling , excellent production of relaxation , solubility , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by any but the skilled . New anesthesias in current use are of two types : inhalation anesthesias , which we know as gas , and drugs such as avertin , pentothal , and the barbiturates . These , as do the older gases still in wide use , such as - ether , chloroform , and nitrous oxide , and the older drugs , such as morphine and atropin , have definite advantages and disadvantages . Because of the complexities involved in their administration there is a new specialty , anesthesiology . Today the best anesthetists are doctors specializing in anesthesia . Their professional organization , the American Board of Anesthesiology , was founded as recently as 1937 ; the importance of its diplomates may be judged by the fact that the Army commissioned them majors . The anesthetist is in charge of the operating room in Army hospitals and in some other hospitals . Although the surgeon is the ultimate authority , it is the anesthetist who sees to it that your operation runs on schedule . He is responsible for your welfare and safety from the  | moment he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are moved back to your bed or the recovery ward . The recovery ward is a room in big modern hospitals where patients are ender the care of specially trained nurses bntil they emerge from the anesthetic . ) It is easy to understand why the anesthetist is important . Not only are the drugs , gases , and gadgets he uses come ; Heated and difficult to understand , but he must be on the qui vive every instant during an operation . Your life depends on the fact that his attention never wanders . Constantly he watches your respiration . The character of your breathing is the clue to your condition . As long as you breathe in regular , even fashion , he knows you are all right . If your respiration becomes slow or shallow or irregular , he ekes prompt action . He may take one of several measures ; usually the first is to give you more oxygen . You see , during the operation you have a mask on your face , for you are Living in a little closed atmosphere of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anesthetic gas , oxygen , and soda lime . The soda lime absorbs his carbon dioxide you exhale . If the anesthetist concludes , from your respiratan , that your anesthesia has become too deep or that you have too little oxygen er too much carbon dioxide , he gives you more oxygen . Sometimes , because of your cosition , required by the operation , you ray have a hard time breathing . Then the anesthetist may help you breathe by ueezing the bagful of atmosphere . The anesthetist also takes your blood ressure every few minutes . He always is king sure that you are warm . your for is noymal , your skin is dry . If there any change in your condition , he may ve you fluids or even a blood transHE trained anesthetist knows how to use all the complex modern anestheas and how to cope swiftly with any Ligencies . The conscientious anesthetist ho does not have this highly specialized aining is likely to use old -- fashioned - op ether .

One is its simplicity equipment ? no fancy gas machines , ist a can of ether and a mask .

It also reduces good relaxation . Ether has its advantages , but its advantages outweigh them . So if you must have an operation , you may have modern anesthesia administered by a trained anesthetist . Unfortunately , there are still too few of them .
