txt New Rules Frustrates Canoeist To Sports Editor Of The New York Times : I wish to add my emphatic squawk to a recent protest about the new prohibition on canoes floating through State locks with other craft . I have just returned from a vacation ? blasted by bumping unexpectedly into this new rule , after having spent the previous three weekends paddling up to Albany in order to go on up the Mohawk . I was alone and portage was out of the question . All I could do was paddle back in disappointment . It seems utterly iniquitous to penalize all canoeists and , as in my case , to exclude them from the scenic beauties of our State , merely because a couple of chumps tipped over froth " water action " in a lock , which is nothing like the " water action " in the wake of any Diesel " yacht " ( as they like to call them ) . As Mr. Melbourne suggested last week , the State could avoid financial responsibility by posting signs . DANIEL H. KRUPP . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
