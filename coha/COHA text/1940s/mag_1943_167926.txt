Death came in Manhattan last fortnight to Columbia 's Professor Franz Boas , who more than 30 years ago scientifically demolished " this Nordic nonsense " in The Mind of Primitive Man , a book which has since been called the Magna Charta of self-respect for the so-called lower races . <P> For 59 years he measured , compared , ' talked facts about humanity , trained most of the outstanding U.S. anthropologists of today. * <P> Boas wrote , in a letter to TIME in 1936 : " The assumption of the biological homogeneity of any race is a fiction . Every race contains many family strain ? which are biologically distinct . . . . The physiological and psychological behavior of the individual depends only in part upon his hereditary characteristics . These differ widely within every population and are strongly overlaid by outer , cultural influences which modify the hereditary traits . . . . Personality can not be assumed to be determined by the so-called racial groups ... but is a matter that must be determined individually . " <P> After his retirement in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hitler taught me that it is not only necessary to discover scientific truths about man ; it is necessary to spread them in the world . Science alone was not enough to check the wide acceptance of the race nonsense of Naziism . " <P> He also said : " If we were to select the most intelligent , imaginative , energetic and emotionally stable third of mankind , all races would be represented . " <P> When death came to Franz Boas , 84 , he had earned the title of a great humanitarian . <P> &lt;FOOTNOTES&gt; * Among his students : Margaret Mead ( And Keep Your Powder Dry , TIME , Nov. 30 ) , Colum bia 's Ruth Benedict , Yale 's Edward Sapir , Northwestern 's Melville Jean Herskovits , the late Elsie Clews Parsons , University of Cali fornia 's Alfred L.
