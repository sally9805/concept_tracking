The great day had come at last . At 5:25 one gloomy morning last week , a tall , husky girl in an old green bathing suit strode down to the beach at Cap Gris Nez , France . Well displayed across her ample bosom were the words " Black Magic . " She dunked a toe in the icy waters , announced that she was not really scared , and struck out in the general direction of Dover , England . For fame , for fortune , and for Scripps-Howard and United Artists , grease-coated , 17-year-old Shirley May France of Somerset , Mass. was trying to swim the English Channel . <P> It was a pressagent 's dream , and it had been largely dreamed up by pressagents . For her busty boost to the movie Black Magic , United Artists was paying Shirley May 1,000 ( $4,000 ) , which she could not take out of Britain . Scripps-Howard 's Newspaper Enterprise Association had anted up some $2,500 in dollars for the exclusive rights to Shirley May 's byline and to feature picture coverage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporters and photographers to cover Shirley May 's big dip . <P> On both sides of the Channel , newsmen mobilized enough equipment to report a medium-sized war : rocket signals , marine radios , walkie-talkies , telescopes , carrier pigeons , eight boats and three planes . But Shirley May 's target date ( Aug. 14 ) came &; went . Reporter Bob Musel , ghosting her diary for N.E.A. and covering the story for United Press , blamed repeated postponements on training hitches and bad weather . Delicately , he skirted the main reason , which Editor &; Publisher reported as " a delay due to a monthly occurrence peculiar to women . " <P> Head Up , Chin Up . Last week , when Shirley May finally took the plunge , she had missed the good weather . She also missed most of the newsmen . On their way over from England , they were far out in mid-Channel at take-off time aboard a picturesque but snail-slow two-masted schooner , christened the Black Magic by Shirley May 's press agent Ted Worner ( and later rechristened the Black Maria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hired its own steamer , the Red Commodore ( complete with a restaurant and bar ) , as well as a speedboat and plane , so it had six staffers on the spot . <P> When the Black Magic caught up with Shirley May , Reporter Musel climbed up in the rigging , relayed his tardy report to U.P . by walkie-talkie . An eager-beaver Mutual newscaster tried to creep down beside Shirley May for a waterside interview , but she was too busy . From the Black Magic 's deck , Frank Sinatra records beamed encouragement to the struggling swimmer : " Down &; down I go , round &; round I go , like a leaf that 's caught in the tide . . . under That Old Black Magic . . . " The Red Commodore also relayed a message from young ( 18 ) Briton Philip Mickman , who had unobtrusively swum the Channel two weeks before : " Head up , chin up , spit it out , beat Old Man Channel .
