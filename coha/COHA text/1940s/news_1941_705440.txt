txt Leaders of building trades unions of the American Federation of Labor whose members are on strike at Wright Air Field have been unofficially told through War Department sources that unless their dispute with the C. I. 0 . is settled by tomorrow the Army will take over the contract and seek to have it coinpleted with employes from the Civil Service lists . War Department officials indicated they had reached the end of their patience with the strike , caused by the refusal of 400 A. F. L. workers to continue operations because workers affiliated with the C. I. 0 . have been doing work for an electrical contractor on the air field . The walkout is the second called since Jan. 30 by A. F. L. building mechanics . As a result of the unofficial warning , Daniel Tracy , Second Assistant Secretary of Labor , and Joseph Keenan , a mediator on the staff of Sidney Hillman , associate director of OPM , were seeking tonight to work out a settlement of the jurisdictional conflict . The dispute has delayed for about two months the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2,000 to 2,500 horsepower superaircraft engines . On March 4 the War Department ordered the Penner Construction Company of New York , which has a contract for $36.000 of electrical work at the field , to proceed with Its task . The company had been ordered by the department on Jan. 31 to cease work because A. F. of L. workers had suspended operations the previous day . Testifies on Delay The War Department waited from Jan. 31 until March 4 while conferences were being held to adjust the situation . Five electricians of the C. I. 0 . remained off the job and the members of the A. F. L. returned , but when the War Department announced it could no longer afford to have the Penner Company I remain idle , since it had a valid I contract , the A. F. L. unionists went on their second strike , which is still in effect . Total cost of the construction work at the airfield amounts to 1$5,900,000 . The contract calls for facilities that are needed at once I by the Army Air Corps for the testing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of new types , according to the statement issued by the War Depart , meat when it ordered the Penner 1Company to resume construction . In this statement , the department , for the first time since the defense program began , criticized a labor stoppage . Merrill C. Meigs , chairman of the aircraft section of the OPM , told the- House Judiciary Committee today that several comparatively minor strikes affecting the completion of small parts would definitely hold up airplanes needed in the defense program . He mentioned strikes at the Universal Cyclops Corporation , Bridgeville , Pa. , the Harvill diecasting plant at Los Angeles and the strike at the , Wright Air Field . He stated that while the percentage of workers involved in these strikes was relatively small , the requirements of airplane construction were such as to cause serious disruption of production schedules if a plant making a small part should be tied up .

" He said that they would have to stop production of some of their planes this week and he thought the same situation would hold with other plants . " Lack of castings , said Mr. Meigs , was even more vital than the lack of finished propellers held up by the Cyclops plant strike " because all the work must atop on the air frame until these die castings are available to put the different pieces together . " Mr. Meigs said that the Stewart . Warner Company had to stop making fuses for bombs last week because the strike at the Universal Cyclops Corporation prevented delivery of the required steel . " The insidious part is that , while the public wo n't stand a strike at a big aircraft factory , no one pays any attention to a strike at a smaller plant which may be just as important , " he added .
