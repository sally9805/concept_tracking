By Hatfield-McCoy standards , there was too much talk and not anywhere near enough damage . But nobody could accuse Henry Kaiser and Republic Steel 's President Charles M. White of not trying . Kaiser , in a surprise deal with War Assets Administrator Jess Larson , had snatched the Government 's $28 million Cleveland blast furnace from under White 's nose ( TIME , Aug. 30 ) ; last week , when Senator Kenneth Wherry 's Small Business Committee looked into that deal , the feud was out in the open . <P> Kaiser charged that White had " tried to blackjack the Government " into letting Republic have the plant dirt-cheap . He told how once , on the telephone , White had called him " the kind of fellow that carries a pistol in his pocket . " When Kaiser tried to recall the date , White offered to provide it . Said he : " I had a stenographer on the telephone . " <P> Sneered Kaiser : " You would have . " <P> Sneered White : " You 're goddamned right I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White had refused to let Kaiser set foot on his new property until after midnight Aug. 31 ( when Republic 's interim lease expired ) . WAAdministrator Larson confirmed this . White , he said , had told him : " It 's going to give me a lot of pleasure to make it tough for those bastards . " <P> Though he had lost the plant , White was still fighting . His talk about cutting off some 400 northeastern foundries from their pig-iron supplies had whipped up terrific pressure from the foundrymen . Moreover , White knew that the plant , which Republic built , was so much a part of Republic 's other operations that it could never be cut out of them without a long shutdown . Kaiser confessed that he was in for trouble unless the committee could " make a Christian out of White . " <P> The committee soon discovered that Republic needed the plant 's hot metal ( to make steel ) as badly as the foundrymen needed the pig iron . That gave White and Kaiser a reason to get together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their popguns and signed a temporary truce . <P> Under it , Kaiser-Frazer got the plant , but agreed to let Republic run it until next May ; by then Republic was expected to have a new pig-iron source . Meanwhile , Republic will supply K-F with 5,000 tons out of its monthly 37,500-ton pig-iron production . Charlie White had driven a shrewd bargain . His rent to Kaiser-Frazer is $1.40 a ton of iron produced , while Kaiser-Frazer must pay WAA $1.50 . Thus , as long as White runs the plant , Kaiser loses a dime on every ton of iron that Republic makes .
