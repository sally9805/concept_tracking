For two months the excitement along Broadway had been mounting . At the tail end of a lively but not very lustrous season there loomed one of the brightest theatrical events in years : England 's world-famous Old Vic was arriving for six weeks of repertory , with such topnotchers in its cast as Laurence Olivier ( TIME , April 8 ) and Ralph Richardson ( TIME , Dec. 31 ) . On the morning last month when the box office first opened , double lines of ticket buyers stretched for blocks ; and by the evening last week when the first curtain rose on Henry IV , Part I , the advance sale had reached nearly $250,000 . <P> The extraordinarily glittering first-night audience that had paid $12 a seat-in some cases less to see than to be seen- trooped back , virtually en masse , the next night . Then it had the very rare opportunity of witnessing Henry IV , Part II- last produced on Broadway in 1867 . The Old Vic had clearly started off with its heaviest artillery. + But when the boom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had won the engagement. ** <P> It was no easy engagement to win . The seven-hour whole of Henry IV is a magnificent but multiform , a spacious but sprawling stage piece . Large as it is , even the two-part play is a rounded fragment of something larger-of that turbulent pageant of ambition and treachery , of glory and vainglory , known as Shakespeare 's chronicle plays . Even that greatest asset of Henry IV-the bestriding presence of Falstaff-remains a possible peril , for it requires notable performing to do him justice . <P> Part Score . Dramatically , Part I beats Part II all hollow . It is more tightly knit , it moves with greater speed and swell , and it traces the upward curve of most of its characters ' destinies . Falstaff , still the boon companion of the errant , frivoling Prince Hal , swaggers and swills in rich midsummer plenty . In a flare of eloquence and arms , the rebellion against Henry IV , led by the heedless , dauntless Hotspur , progresses to the plains of Shrewsbury , where the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the drama becomes muffled and intermittent . Hotspur lies slain by Hal ; the rebels are betrayed and broken ; guilt-laden Henry , who had usurped Richard II 's crown , sickens and dies ; Falstaff roisters now without his Prince , " Who-when he becomes his King-brutally dismisses him . Only for Hal does glory lie ahead . <P> Acting out this long , congested story , the Old Vic remembered first &; foremost that it was Shakespeare . It offered no tricks or natty novelties ; its only freedom was to build Part II around Falstaff , partly concealing lumpy drama in lively theater . <P> Here &; there the Old Vic proved disappointing . For a great repertory company , it had more than its quota of indifferent actors ; there was no great distinction in their rendering of speech or verse . ( The musicomedy-sized Century Theater made for hearing trouble . ) But they had the main thing-a real Shakespearean robustiousness . In Part I they contrived a fine balance between the historical scenes and the humorous ones , a telling contrast between that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that arch-realist and epitome of worldly wisdom , Falstaff . And they had for this two brilliant actors .
