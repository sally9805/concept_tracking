With growing vexation , the U.S. people had watched the United Nations , like a kind of 58-legged race , try to walk . It did n't seem to be able to ; in fact , it seemed to have reached the point where it was lingering betwixt a balk and a breakdown . Last week , under pressure from thousands of their constituents , six Congressmen trooped before the House Foreign Affairs Committee to plead that the U.S. do something-anything-to strengthen U.N . <P> The obvious villain was the veto . Among dozens of resolutions submitted , the one most strongly backed was a plan which had been devised by World Planner ( and onetime Bridge Expert ) Ely Culbertson . It was endorsed by 16 Senators and 14 Congressmen . It would eliminate the veto in matters of aggression . If the Russians refused to agree , the other nations of the world would set up a revised U.N . without them . Fired with enthusiasm , the Foreign Affairs Committee was all set to stamp it with approval . <P> Then Secretary of State George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he declared , could only mean the disintegration of U.N . The Soviet bloc , the Arab states , perhaps the Far Eastern bloc would walk out , leaving the world divided into three or four armed camps . Many friendly nations , with whom the U.S. has a strong working alliance in the U.N. , would jump for a neutral corner . Said U.N . Delegate Warren Austin : " The only possible bridge between the East &; West would collapse ; and yet , the problem of bridging the gap between the East &; West is precisely the crucial problem of our time . " <P> That problem , Marshall declared , was one not of form but of substance . The veto was merely the expression of a larger obstacle to world peace-Russian intransigence . If the veto were banished from U.N. , it would still exist in the world-as Russian armed force . <P> Russian obduracy was based on the hope that democracy needed just one more shove before it collapsed . The U.S. intended to prove that it would not collapse . If the Russians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world with democracy , George Marshall thought , they would cooperate . Until they did , forcing changes in the forms of international cooperation was not only wasted but also dangerous effort . <P> In frustration and exasperation , Minnesota 's Walter Judd cried : " We are sitting here doing nothing and letting the world go to hell . " But most Congressmen , sobered by the testimony , were no longer eager to cast a vote for the revision plan . Marshall and Austin , though deploring the tactics , were far from decrying the spirit . They asked for a resolution supporting the U.S. 's patient efforts to shore up the structure of U.N . " from within " through the Little Assembly , and restriction of the veto in peaceful settlements .
