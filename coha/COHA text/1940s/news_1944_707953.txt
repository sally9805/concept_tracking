txt Three hundred and fifty or more persons were killed in the double explosion which shattered two munitions ships late last night , wrecked a Navy loading pier and left a " scorched earth " scene in this war boom town , forty miles northeast of San Francisco . Material damage caused by the blast , one of the most disastrous in the country 's history , was put at more than $5,000,000 , excluding the value of the thousands of tons of munitions blown up . The munitions ships , both almost new , were valued at about $4,300,000 . A Coast Guard crash boat and a fire barge also were destroyed and a tanker was damaged . Hundreds of persons , possibly as many as a thousand , were injured . Every building in a radius of two or three miles was razed or damaged . Many stood at crazy angles , roofless or with walls caved in . Summary of Death Toll The death toll of Navy personnel , exclusive of members of the armed guard aboard the ships , was listed as " between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Nine Navy officers supervising the loading of the ships by sailors lost their lives , as did fifteen Coast Guardsmen . Seventy Maritime Commission seamen ' were killed . Three civilian railroad workers riding on a locomotive and two cars near the explosion scene were never seep again and the pieces of the train were scattered over a wide area . No civilian residents of the blast area are known'to have been killed . Six of the injured were at work in the Benicia Arsenal seven miles across the bay from Port Chicago . Col. Paul G. Rutten , commanding officer of the arsenal , estimated damages to arsenal buildings at about $150,000 . Capt . N. H. Goss , commanding officer of the naval ammunition depot at Mare Island , who has jurisdiction over the Port Chicago installation , voiced the belief that the cause of the explosion never would be known . " We have no basis for giving any cause , " he said , " as there are no close survivors tp , , give evidence of what happened . " Navy Inquiry Expected The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The blast area , including Port Chicago and Martinez , was put under quasi-martial law as Sheriff James Long of Contra Costa County called for military aid in policing it . Doubt was expressed that many of the bodies ever would be identified . It may be days . before the death roster is complete . A Navy spokesman said that no death list would be made public until the next of kin had been notified . Newspaper men , admitted to the area ten hours after the explosion , saw why some residents thought at first that there had been an enemy bombing . Acres of pier had been blown away , leaving the tops of piles sticking a few feet out of the water . Twisted stacks of umber and rubbish were everywhere . A railroad track running out to the wrecked pier was dipping almost into the bay . Barracks at the loading station were demolished and other structures , including a carpenter shop , had disintegrated . Observers had to take the word of Navy spokesmen that two ships had been tied up at the pier when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1:20 A. M. , New York time ) . The twisted bow of one ship lay on its side , protruding twenty feet or so out of the bay . A hundred feet away a propeller shaft was visible . Debris littered the water , but the ships , except for these parts , had ' sunk or been scattered . One sailor I reported that a piece of sternpost landed in his barracks room a half mile away . Port Chicago , with a peacetime population of about 1,500 , lies a few miles west of the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers , where they empty into Suisun Bay , an arm of San Francisco Bay . In the development of the war loading port the Navy built acres of two-story barracks for pier ' workers . The barracks are a half ! mile out of town . The population of the barracks , all of which were lamaged , with many left uninhabitable , was put at around 1,40p . It was reported unofficially that most of the sailors working the loading shift at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rear Admiral C. H. Wright , commandant of the Twelfth Naval District , declared that all of those killed gave their lives " in the service of their country . " " Their sacrifice could not have been greater , " he said , " had it occurred on a battleship or a beachhead on the war fronts . Their conduct was in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States naval service . " The destroyed vessels were the 10,000-ton Quinault Victory , a Victory ship delivered a week ago by the Oregon Shipbuilding Corporation at Portland , Ore. , and the 7,500-ton E. A. Bryan , a Liberty ship delivered by Richmond Yard No. 2 March 8 . Both yards are in the Henry J. Kaiser organization . The Quinault Victory was operated by the United States Steamship Lines and the Bryan by the Olivehumjl Olson Company . The damaged tanker was a Red Line ship . One of the ships , according to Captain Goss , was loaded with " several thousand tons of explosives " and the other was " only slightly loaded " when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his crew of forty-one assigned to the Bryan were on authorized shore liberty last night and were presumed to he safe . Of fifty-two in the crew of the Quinault Victory sixteen had liberty passes and eight of these had reported in this afternoon . Observers marveled that the damage had not been even greater . A munition train standing hardly more than a city block from the water 's edge was undamaged . Other freight cars dotted the reservation , but most of them were unscathed . In the main barracks area , every wndow was blown out . Some of the war-built structures collapsed . The sides of others were blown out . In Port Chicago the wall of a theatre was crushed , but with injury to only a few in the audience . At the Santa Fe depot broken glass strewed the floor . Store windows were smashed . A main street grocer , Pop Graham , found that 1,500 glasses of jellies and preserves had been broken . ? The town was left without gas , electricity or running water . But late tonight the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers announced , and progress was being made toward re-establishing electric and telephone service . A man who was passed through the lines by State highway police and military sentries at about 5 A. M. , said that he had waited for hours on the outskirts afraid to go to his home . " I work in the steel mill over in Pittsburgh , " he said , " It have a wife and five kids . I was afraid to come home . I was afraid they all were dead . My house is gone . But the family 's safe . " The clock in the Port Chicago Hotel stopped at 10:19 . This was the time the blast shook the bay area so hard that its force was registered pn the seismograph of the Univeisity of California at Berkeley . As pieced together by the authorities , the basic story is about SS follows : Gangs of Navy enlisted men , wOrking as stevedorbs , were well along in the loading of the Quinault Victory with a cargo of high explosives of all types for use in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up near by and the loading of her holds with munitions had just begun , , One ship blew up at 10:19 , the others blew up about five seconds later . Flames shot toward the sky . A naval aviator flying over the installation at 8.000 feet had to climb to 10,000 feet to escape the fire and debris . A motorist described ' the rising mass of fiery debris as " a flaming doughnut . " As the force of the explosion was dissipated , air rushed in to fill the atmospheric vacuum . Its force was estimated at 150 miles an hour . One 200-pound ship fragment Sailed more than two miles . Debris was hurled out into the bay for hundreds of yards . A warning was sent out for small craft to proceed through the adjacent waters with care . Disaster relief units , military and civilian , formed early in the war to act in case of a Japanese attack , swung swiftly into motion . Doctors , nurses and hospital facilities throughout the bay area were " alerted . " Ambulances were sent from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The number of civilian casualties was , large , but few of the injuries were expected to be fatal . For the first few hours relief , workers labored in darkness or , with flashlights . Before dawn brilliant floodlights illuminated the scene , but the full scope of the disaster was not revealed until daylight . Communications Hampered ? Long after the explosion was felt in San Francisco and more distant places the exact location was a mystery . Communications were down and the Navy got piecemeal information by short-wave radio . Cars with no official business were shunted off the roads to wait until the doctors , nurses and ambulances had got through . Rear Admiral Henry F. Bruns , in charge of docks and construction , visited the disaster scene . As Navy investigators went over the ground , agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced that they were not participating in the inquiry . The relief work on the naval reservation was supervised by Capt . Merrill Kinne , its commanding officer , who kept on the job in spite of slight injuries . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barracks were asleep and that the casualties in the residential area of the reservation were confined to injuries . First calls for fire equipment , sent out at the time of the explosions , were soon canceled . The fire was confined to the pier area and was quickly under control . Many in the area agreed on essentially the following : " We thought it was the Japs bombing us . " Many , especially persons living down the peninsula , south of San Francisco and as far aAninety miles from the explosion scene , felt a slight tremor and thought another earthquake had struck the bay area . Some near Port Chicago were thrown from their beds . Windows were broken in towns as far as twenty miles away . All day long sightseers were - kept out of the community . After Sheriff Long had called for help in policing the vicinity soldiers were sent in with an armored car mounting an anti-tank gun . They took up stations to protect Government property and prevent looting of civilian establishments wrecked or damaged . Nobody was permitted to enter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clarence A. Hennessy of the infantry , who commanded the detachment of troops . Captain Goss , in his statement at a press conference , paid high tribute to rescue and relief workers , saying that the absence of lights and power , coupled with the fact that the night was " extremely cold , " offered serious handicaps . " This morning , " he said , " we were pleased to learn that not one injured man could be found at Port Chicago . " He hailed " the grand cooperation of the Army . " He described last night 's shiploading operation as " merely a routine one , as we have loaded many , many ships at the port . " " As the work was being done by enlisted personnel , we had heavy supervision and as a result heavy officer loss , " he declared . " We had very few seriously injured among the enlisted personnel and these are being taken care of at near-by military hospitals . Of the casualties the most serious are several leg fractures and serious eye injuries . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarette might have caused the explosion . In the Federal District Court at San Francisco during the day Judge A. F. St. Sure sentenced a marine fireman to ninety days in jail for smoking aboard a ship which was loading munitions at Richmond last week . " It 's high time we put a stop to this smoking on ships carrying explosives , " Judge St. Sure declared from the bench . " It is difficult to impress upon you men that you are subjecting ships , crews , civilians and property to a grave danger . You might have caused hundreds of deaths and destroyed thousands of dollars worth of property . " Victor J. Samulis , 31 , who received the sentence , had pleaded guilty , but said he had not been told of the smoking ban . He was the twentieth person sentenced in the bay area for smoking on munitions ships since April 1 , ' when the Coast Guard began a drive against the practice . Most ' sentences have been fines of $25 to $250 or jail terms up to thirty days .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
