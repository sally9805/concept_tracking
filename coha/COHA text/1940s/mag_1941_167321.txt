The 2,000,000 clubwomen of America-represented by 3,000 delegates and alternates attending the Golden Jubilee Convention of the General Federation of Women 's Clubs-last week faced the issues of a world at war . Senators Wheeler and Pepper debated the issue of intervention before them . They heard Colonel Bill Donovan , recently returned from Europe as an Administration emissary , urge all-out aid to Britain . The response was extraordinary for the generally well-mannered meetings of the Federation . The galleries booed and cheered with organized isolationist efficiency . <P> The galleries , however , were open to spectators at sof a head . The real sentiment of the convention became apparent later . The Federation 's leaders , including Mrs. John L. Whitehurst , newly elected president , were anything but isolationists . <P> The delegates seemed puzzled by the young women who handed out leaflets showing flag-draped coffins and the legend : " Will one of these bundles from Britain be your son ? " When the delegates came to voting , they went just as far on foreign policy as Franklin Roosevelt had gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain as may be necessary to defeat the Nazis . They voted heartily in favor of all-out national defense . They assessed themselves 50% extra in national dues to raise $100,000 for the Federation 's national defense program .
