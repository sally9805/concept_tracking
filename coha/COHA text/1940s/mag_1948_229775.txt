Within their ornate frames , the Edwardian ladies &; gentlemen looked just as the most fashionable artists of their day had found them-rich , well-bred , proud , and usually a trifle bored . These proper people , in proper painting , hung last week in Manhattan 's Metropolitan Museum celebrating New York City 's 50th anniversary as an incorporated big city ( TIME , June 7 ) . <P> There was Giovanni Boldini 's wispy Duchess of Marlborough propped stiffly on her spindly divan ; Whistler had caught bewhiskered Theodore Duret wistfully holding a lady 's opera cape in some carpeted corridor . And William M. Chase had come upon the bemonocled Whistler sporting an absurd little cane and striking his dandy 's pose . But most of the Edwardians represented at the museum ( the Phelps Stokeses , the Wyndham sisters , Mme. Gautreau , Miss Ada Rehan , Henry Marquand ) had sought out , or been sought out by , the slickest and most fashionable painter of their day to immortalize them - John Singer Sargent . <P> Hals Remembered . Painter Sargent was 45 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite the thing to be " painted by Sargent . " He was a portly , generous gentleman , more at home with his fellow expatriate Henry James than with the eccentric Bohemians of the art world . He resisted the Pre-Raphaelites and " Ruskin , do n't you know . . . silly old thing . " He ignored the principles of art for art 's sake , detested Gauguin and Van Gogh . His advice to one of his own disciples : " Begin with Franz Hals , copy and study Franz Hals , after that go to Madrid and copy Velasquez . . . " <P> In his cheery studio on London 's Tite Street , he worked doggedly at his portraits , muttering behind his easel when things did n't work out the way he wanted , " Gainsborough would have done it ! ... Gainsborough would have done it . " Sometimes he held his sitters ' attention by painting his own nose red or pretending to eat his cigar . <P> He became so used to his sitters ' criticisms that he began to define @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something wrong about the mouth . " But he always refused to change his work . Once , a lady complained about the way he had done her nose . " Oh , you can alter a little thing like that , " said Sargent , quickly handing her the portrait , " when you get it home . " <P> He was amazed at the fortune his painting brought him ( " It ca n't be mine , " he said once when someone told him his bank balance . " They 've made a mistake at the bank ; it must belong to someone else " ) . He felt miscast as a portraitist : " Portrait painting is a pimp 's profession . " <P> Portraits Forgotten . Late in life , he tried to change . " No more paughtraits , " he once wrote triumphantly to a friend . " I abhor and abjure them , and hope never to do another especially of the Upper Classes . " During World War I , he trundled off to try his hand at battle scenes ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he remarked to a general at the front ) . He tried landscapes , character sketches ( " a lot of mugs in ... charcoal " ) and watercolors which he scornfully labeled " Triple Bosh , " " Blokes , " " Idiots of the Mountains , " " Intertwingles . " But they were never enough to free him .
