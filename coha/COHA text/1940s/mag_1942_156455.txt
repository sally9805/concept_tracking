One hundred years ago broad-shouldered , poker-faced Francisco Morazn , a fighting man who dreamed of democracy and unity in the corrupt and revolt-torn states of Central America , directed his own death scene . At San Jos in Costa Rica , Morazn commanded the firing squad which faced him . He corrected the aim , ordered fire , fell , raised his bloody head to order a second volley . He died as great a hero in Central America as Simn Bolivar in South America . <P> The man whose legions of fanatic peasants finally captured Morazn after 18 turbulent years of early federation was an illiterate swineherd named Rafael Carrera . He later became known as " General Cholera Morbus , " because he claimed that those opposing him spawned a cholera plague by poisoning wells . His support came from ignorant Indians , reactionary churchmen and landowners , minor despots and foreign governments stirring up trouble as a normal accompaniment to 19th-Century colonial policy . <P> Still plagued by poverty , reaction , disease , despotism and ignorance , the five republics have more often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morazn 's dream of La Gran Patria Centroamericana . This week , on the centenary of Morazn 's death , their representatives were scheduled to converge on San Jos to consider , warily and with varying degrees of enthusiasm , the latest proposal to unite as one nation . <P> Once joined , the 7,500,000 Central Americans and their 178,000 square miles of coffee , banana and mining land would rank fifth in population among Latin American nations . Its pride revived , Central America might emerge from the backwaters of the world as a more useful and prosperous member of the Western Hemisphere 's family of nations . <P> Keeper of the Dream . The invitations to consider unification were issued through Salvador Mendieta , rector ( until his resignation last week ) of Central University at Managua , Nicaragua . For 40 years septuagenarian Mendieta has kept Morazn 's dream alive in the minds of students . Back of Mendieta was the sponsorship of Nicaragua 's dictatorlet , genial President General Anastasio Somoza . <P> A practitioner of celebrations , circuses and public works for his land of spectacular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the backing of the Nicaraguan National Guard - presented to him by U.S. marines who finally withdrew on Jan. 2 , 1933 . Last week he used them to arrest 13 persons , including Conservative generals accused of a German-inspired revolt plot . He believes that there is strength and prosperity in union . " All you have to do , " says he , " is go to the U.S. and you can see that . " <P> General Somoza 's highly sensible plan calls for a common currency , a single flag , a common customs union , a federal army and a federal congress . With a typical Central American gesture , he offered to resign as president " at any time a union . . . can be brought about . "
