Many observations , too trivial by themselves for the daily news stories , add up to conclusions pertinent in measuring the man picked to end the rule of Rooseveltism . So much attention has been directed upon the candidate and upon the campaign that little attention has been given recently to the man Thomas E. Dewey . Memories of His Career . The fight against the New Deal has been so absorbing that It has dimmed recollections of Dewey as successful prosecutor of the gangster-politico alliances in New York City and has even shadowed his commendable record as chief executive of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The articles will refresh your memory , will remind you that next Wednesday 's distinguished visitor is a man who has done things as well as a man who promises to do things .

" And he leads the way , " added another . Future for America 's Sons . There were chuckles , but the comments were not entirely flippant . There is no doubt but what Dewey 's thoughts of a future for America include thoughts of a future for his two boys . Before telling of Dewey 's rise in New York as a fearless and successful prosecutor of racketeers and political crooks , let 's look sonic more at the background that makes this Presidential candidate act like he does and talk like he does .
