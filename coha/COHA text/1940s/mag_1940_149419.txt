PILGRIM 'S WAY-Lord Tweedsmuir-Houghton , Mifflin ( $3 ) . <P> When Novelist John Buchan , first Baron Tweedsmuir ( for his Scottish birthplace ) of Elsfield ( for his home in Oxford ) , died last February in his 66th year , his fifth as Governor General of Canada , he had already finished the autobiography his career made inevitable . This provision was of a piece with the career-workmanlike , ordered , conscientious , religiously dutiful - which the last of John Buchan 's 50-odd books records . <P> Son of a Presbyterian parson , " the best man I have ever known , " wry-faced little John Buchan grew up in the poetry and parsimony of the Scottish border , went to Oxford on Caledonian determination and a shoestring , published his first book ( Scholar Gipsies ) to help pay his college expenses . He was admitted to the bar , but his life work really began when he was made Private-Secretary to the High Commissioner for South Africa , Lord Milner . From Milner and Kitchener he absorbed an extraordinary philosophy of empire which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy , which the later John Buchan found increasingly hard to talk about , may have been propagated and enforced by Kiplingesque brutality but had no spiritual kinship with it . Saluting it from the wistful distance of 40 years , Buchan remembers : <P> " I dreamed of a world-wide brotherhood with the background of a common race and creed , consecrated to the service of peace : Britain enriching the rest out of her culture and traditions . . . . I saw in the Empire a means of giving to the congested masses at home open country instead of a blind alley . . . . Our creed was not based on antagonism to any other people . It was humanitarian and international ; we believed that we were laying the basis of a federation of the world . . . . The ' white man 's burden ' is now an almost meaningless phrase ; then it involved a new philosophy of politics , and an ethical standard , serious and surely not ignoble . " <P> Disappointed in his hopes of a financial post with Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk in London , lived through the war 's disenchantments , dabbled bashfully in politics because he thought it was his duty . When his great friend and hero George V sent him to Ottawa in 1935 , when he had already made an imperial name for himself as a novelist and biographer and had adjudged himself too old for a career in Parliament , John Buchan sprang into action like one of Milner 's young war horses , did a difficult job as ably as his teachers did theirs a generation before . <P> Not for nothing do the portraits of John Buchan bear a slight resemblance to those of Calvin Coolidge . His native taciturnity reinforced by a diplomat 's decision to write " at length only of the dead , " Autobiographer Buchan was evidently not writing for posthumous publication . Of the mental climate in which he grew up , the architecture of his life and his world , he writes warmly and well . Of himself , he tells as little as an autobiographer decently can .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
