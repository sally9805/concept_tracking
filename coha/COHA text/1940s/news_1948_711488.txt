txt COMMUNISTS HELD HISS TO BE MEMBER , BENZ TESTIFIES He Tells House Committee Pressman , Abt and Witt Also Belonged to the Party PERJURY CASE IS PRESSED Thomas , U. S. Attorney Meet on Chambers-Hiss Testimony ? Rosen Questioned on Car By JOHN D. MORRIS Special to Tee New Yam TIMES . WASHINGTON , Aug. 26 ? Louis I Budenz testified at a secret hearing last Tuesday that he and other pre-war Communist leaders had regarded Alger Hiss as a Communist , the House Committee on UnAmerican Activities disclosed today . It made available the transcript of the hearing , at which Mr. Budenz , who now teaches at Fordham University , referred to Mr. Hiss as " under Communist discipline " before the war and as a Government official who was regarded . in Communist circles as a party member . This development in the investigation of an alleged pre-war Communist underground coincided with a conference between Representative J. Parnell Thomas of New Jersey , committee chairman , and George Morris Fay , United States Attorney for the District of Columbia , on the advisability of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accuser , Whittaker Chambers . Their sworn testimony has sharply conflicted . In the meantime , a subcommittee questioned a man named William Rosen in connection with the opposing stories , , , , Messrs . Hiss and Chambers lithirtOld about the disposition of a 1929 Ford roadster . Mr. Rosen declined to say whether he was a Communist or give any information on the automobile " zransaction , it was reported . The name of William Rosen appeared on a transfer certificate as the recipient of the car , which Mr. Hiss has said ? he gave to Mr. Chambers . Earlier , the full committee announced an indefinite recess in the public hearings on the current phase of pre-war Communist espionage and underground rings . After further staff investigations , it was said , the complete record , together with recommendations , will be turned over to Attorney General Tom C. Clark . The transcript of Mr. Budenz ' testimony showed that the former managing editor of The Daily Worker also identified Lee Pressman , Nathan Witt and John Abt as Communists . They are former // Government officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that was said to be dedicated to putting Communists in important Federal posts . Mr. Budenz acknowledged that he had not personally known Mr .. Hiss , a former high official in the . State Department and now president of the Carnegie Endowment . for International Peace . He did , know his name , however , from conversations with other party leaders , he testified . Representative Richard M. Nixon , Republican , of California , questioned him as follows : Mr. Nixon : " Well , now , from your experience as an active leader in the Communist party during that period , did you at that time come to the conclusion that Mr. Hiss was a member of the Communist party ? Mr. Budenz : " Oh , yes , so I regarded him always . " Q. You always regarded him as a Communist . A. That is correct . Q. Did others in the party , others in the leadership or the circles that you knew , did they regard him as a member of the party ? A. Yes , sir . Q. What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I have specifically in mind was 1940 and 1941 . Mr. Chambers has testified to his association with Mr. Hiss in the " underground " from 1935 to 1938 . Mr. Budenz said that he had heard Whittaker Chambers mentioned in party circles as a " renegade " and by some other name , which he did not recall , but never as George Crosley or " Carl . " Mr. Hiss has testified that he knew Mr. Chambers as a magazine writer named George Crosley , which Mr. Chambers has denied , saying he was known to Mr. Hiss only as a paid Communist functionary named " Carl . " Tells of Dennis ' Remarks Mr. Budenz gave two examples of having heard Mr. Hiss named within the party as a Communist . ' He said that Eugene Dennis , party secretary , had asked him some time in 1940 or 1941 to get a man in the Government , whom he did not identify , " to erase from his record this technical difficulty , as it was called . " That , Mr. Budenz explained , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name in subversive activities . He added : " At that time Dennis said to me , explaining why he had to call upon this man , that people like Alger Hiss , Nathan Witt and Edwin Smith , who was then a member of the National Labor Relations Board , or was about to leave it- , at any rate he had been associated with the NLRB  --  that people of that character could not be called upon as they had ' peen in the past to aid the party in its defense in Washington because they themselves were under a certain cloud . " That is to say , that all the people in governmental positions , in ? Washington who were friendly to the party , or under Communist discipline , were in difficulties at that time . " Therefore , we would have to find people who had not generally been associated with the party to help us out in these things . That is an instance of two or three that came up during that period . " In the other instance mentioned by the witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought up in 1944 or 1945 in a discussion of what the party could do for several State Department employes who were under prosecution- for removing official documents . " In a political meeting , when the case broke , " Mr. Budenz said , " it was mentioned that Lieutenant Roth , who was a member of the party , had recommended the possibility of getting Mr. Hiss to use some influence in the matter . " He presumably referred to Andrew Roth , then a naval reserve officer on active duty and attached to the State Department , who was later convicted and fined . " I do not know what disposition was ever made of that , and that is why I say it is a rather roundabout reference , " Mr. Budenz added . " But Mr. Hiss ' name was mentioned in that connection ? " Mr. Nixon asked . " That is right , it was , " the witness replied . In reply to further inquiries , Mr. Budenz said that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had questioned him about " lilfr . Hiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year and a half . Mr. Nixon also asked whether references to Mr. Hiss might not have been " simply a case of the Communists ' claiming as their own a person whom they considered to be a liberal ? " " For example , " he said , " is it not possible that they might have referred to Mrs. Roosevelt as being a Communist , or did they refer to , say , Leon Henderson as being a Communist ? " Understand , I wish you to point out if there is a difference in the way in which friends of the party were considered , and those under discipline were considered , because I think there is a distinction that should be drawn , if there is a distinction . " " There is a very definite distinction , " Mr. Budenz responded . " Neither Mrs. Roosevelt nor Mr. Henderson , incidentally , were ever referred to as Communists , " But there is this difference : that is , the Communists did refer to those under discipline in a different manner from the way they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom they wish to use , and whom , they think they can influence . " Of course , there is a remote possibility that Mr. Hiss ' name might have been used incorrectly , but I have never found that to happen among Communists . When reporting to themselves they are always as exact as possible . In fact , sometimes they are painfully exact . " In regard to the relationship of a certain individual to the party and certainly so far as the  --  constant impression on me was con-i cerned it was that Mr. Hiss was equivalent to a member of the Communistpaxty . ' The phrase ' Communist party member ' , so far-sal refer to ltywas never used , and he was associated with Nathan Witt and Edwin Smith , Of course , -. this impression was strengthened in.my mind . In fact , I knew . Mr ; Smith to . be a member of the party . I had met him as such : " The . questioning then turned -0 another phase of -- the committee 's recent investigation during which Miss Elizabeth T. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alleged Communist espionage ring . She admitted to being a courier foci the group . ? Mr. Budenz said that the late Jacob N. GoMs , described by Miss ( Bentley as the Communist functionary who brought her into the spy ring , had once asked him to come to Washington on a matter that " had to do with work in the Office of Strategic Services . " He said that the request , which he was too busy to comply with , was to see a man ' named ' William Ludwig Ullman . Mr. Ullman was identified by Miss Bentley as a Communist who was in the Treasury Department and later in the I Air Forces . She also testified that the spy ring had obtained information from the OSS , which had access to considerable secret data , Mr , Budenz , asked if he had seen anything in the newspaper accounts of Miss Bentley 's testimony that he did not believe , replied : " No , sir . Of course , I do not know of lily own personal knowledge that all of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I knew to exist . " Mr : Thomas ' conference with I Mr. Fay was held in the former 's office under extraordinarily secret conditions for some unexplained reason . They later admitted that the conflicting Hiss-Chambers testimony was the subject of the meeting . At yesterday 's " confrontation " hearing , Mr. Thomas publicly told Messrs . Hiss and Chambers that one of them would be tried forperjury . . Mr. Fay , in asking for daily transcripts , some time ago , had disclosed that he was investigating the case . " It was a washout , " was all Mr. Thomas would say further of today 's conference . This led to the belief that Mr. Fay was unable to say whether he could establish a perjury case against either witness because transcripts of testimony had not been sent to him for the last ten days . Mr. Thomas said that the prosecutor would receive the entire transcript tomorrow . He announced after an earlier closed meeting of the committee that the transcript would be turned over to Attorney General Clark when the investigation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why the Attorney General instead of Mr. Fay . He read the following statement to reporters onthehal ? of the committee : " The committee is most desirous of resolving this Communist espionage investigation ' at Ake earliest possible date . It is ' obvious , however , that the ramifications are great and farflung , which necessitates a continuing and diligent investigation of everything involved . Each day new facts are developed which must be explored . " The committee will therefore continue its search until it is able to come to , a definite conclusion of the matter before it . In the meantime the committee will issue an interim report on Saturday relating to the developments to date . " The committee has more witnesses to be heard , and upon completion of all our hearings the entire testimony will be turned over to the Attorney General with appropriate recommendations . " Inquirers to Visit New York At the press conference following this morning 's full committee meeting , Chairman Thomas said a subcommittee would go to New York , probably on Monday to question J. Peters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pre-war Communist un derground . Mr. Peters , who had been ordered to appear before , immigraton authorities for a ' deportation hearing , will be served a. committee subpoena when and if he , des so . Mr. Thomas said hearings beginning Sept. 7 would deal with " a new espionage case , " reported harboring of known Communists in this country , reports of Communist infiltration into Negro organizations and the case of Dr. ? Edward U. Condon , head of the National Bureau of Standards . A subcommittee has referred to Dr. Condon as one of the weakest links in the nation 's chain of atomic security . The committee has never questioned Dr. Condon in public , although he has ? repeatedly asked for a hearing and has denied the subcommittee 's charge . Mr. Thomas was asked tonight about a report that an American physicist working in the Chicago atomic laboratory transmitted a milligram of separated uranium 235 to Dr. Allan Num May , who was later convicted by the British of spying for Russia . This , according to the report , was - to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prognosticating , " was all he would say . Other committee members either professed ignorance or said " no comment , " but Robert ' E. Stripling , the chief investigator , said that if the report concerned a University of Chicago professor who provided uranium to the Russians " it is not our case . "
