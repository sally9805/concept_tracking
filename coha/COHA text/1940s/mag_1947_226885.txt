Many people get a guilty thrill out of listening in on a party line , spying on the family next door or reading other folks ' postcards . Last week , radio listeners were enjoying the same sort of snooping on a new show called Candid Microphone ( Sun . 7 p.m. , ABC ) . <P> Candid Mike eavesdrops on people and records their unguarded remarks for broadcasting . In seven weeks on the air , the show has picked up the meows from a beauty parlor , lurked behind two unsuspecting expectant fathers in an obstetrician 's office , listened in on a man 's attempts to pick up a girl , argued with a bill collector , recorded what happened when a baby was left on an angry woman 's doorstep . <P> To get the impromptu ( and anonymous ) conversations on the air , Candid Mike 's producer-narrator , Allen Funt , combs Manhattan street corners , hotels , doorsteps , restaurants-any spot where people meet and talk-with his tape recorder . He disguises the mike in a sling , as a hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a pawnshop counter covered by a " for sale " sign . <P> When the victim 's words have been reeled in on the tape , Funt gently breaks the news to him , plays back the sequence , and tries to get permission to use it on the air . He nearly always succeeds ; so far , only three people ( all of them in an Eighth Avenue pawnshop ) have refused . Once in a while the victim is resentful . By last week , Funt had narrowly avoided a couple of fights but was still unbruised . <P> With his records , Funt and six assistants get to work editing out the dull talk and splicing together their show . Every two-minute sequence requires 14 hours of blue-penciling , often as many as 100 splices . When an angry victim breaks into profanity , a Funt-inspired device dubs in a sweet feminine voice which whispers , " Censored . . . censored . . . censored . " <P> Candid Mike already looks like a solid hit . Last week 800 enthusiastic listeners wrote in-including some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fan mail " Funt has ever seen . The dissenting minority , if there was any , could take its cue from the Pittsfield ( Mass . ) Berkshire Eagle , which said : " With this new Machiavellian inspiration , radio crosses the last threshold of privacy . . . . The whole country seems likely to be plagued with hidden microphones . "
