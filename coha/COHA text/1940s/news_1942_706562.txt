By LBWIS WOOL* Specie. / to Teat Ns-yr Toes Mass . WASHINGTON , July 2 ? President Roosevelt today appointed a special Military Commission , composed of seven distinguished Army generals , to try the eight Nazi saboteurs who were arrested after they landed on the Atlantic coast from German submarines . Headed by Major Gen. Frank R. McCoy , the Military Commission will meet in Washington next Wednesday or as soon as possible ! thereafter to proceed with the trial , which will be in secret . 1 Francis Biddle , Attorney General , and Major Gen. Myron C. Cramer , Judge Advocate General of the Army , will prosecute the prisoners , who will be defended by two Presidentially designated Army colonels , Cassius M. Dowell and Kenneth Royall . Yet unannounced , the scene of the trial will be , it is believed , either the Army War College , the huge new War Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armory . While the , Presidential statements gave no hint of the penalty to be sought , 1 it was reliably understood that // ARMY COURT TO TRY 8 NAZI SABOTEURS // death would be demanded by the government . Access to Civil Courts Barred Acting under his broad Constitutional and war powers , President Roosevelt signed a proclamation denying certain persons access to the civil courts in time of war . This assured that Ernest Peter Burger and Herbert Hans Haupt , the two naturalized Germans , should be brought before the military tribunal along with the remaining six Axis agents . The proclamation , the White House explained , " applies only to enemies who have entered this country since the outbreak of the war for the purpose of committing hostile acts against the government . " Besides General McCoy , the Military Commission , said to be the first since the trial of the conspirators to assassinate President Lincoln , includes Major Gen. Walter S. Grant , Major Gen Blanton Winship , Major Gen. Lorenzo D. Gasser , Brig . Gen. Guy V. Henry , Brig . Gen. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . President Roosevelt gave the military commission complete authority to make rules for the trial of the Germans , who , in addition to Burger and Haupt , are : George John Dasch , Henry Harm Heinck , Edward John Kerling , Hermann Otto Neubauer , Richard Quirin and Werner Thiel . Of these , Desch , Burger , Heinck and Quin Amagansett June 13 : and Kerling , Haupt , Thiel and Neubauer , four days later at Pont Vedra Beach , Fla . President to Review Verdict In the " full and fair " trial which he ordered , Mr. Roosevelt defined admissable evidence as that which in General McCoy 's opinion would " have probative value to a reasonable man . " According to military precedents , Mr. Roosevelt provided that a vote of at least two-thirds of the commission present shall be necessary for conviction or sentence . And he , the only person to whom an appeal may be made , added this significant sentence : " The record of the trial including any judgment or sentence shall be transmitted directly to me for my action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies access to the courts of the United States , " explained that the safety of this country demands that all enemies entering the country " as part of an invasion or predatory incursion or who have entered in order to commit sabotage , espionage or other hostile or warlike acts , should be promptly tried in accordance with the Law of War . " Persons coming within this category were ordered to be subject to military tribunals and " shall not be privileged to seek any remedy or maintain any proceeding , directly or indirectly , or to have any such remedy or proceeding sought on their behalf , in the courts of the United States , " except under regulations of the Attorney General approved by the Secretary of War . Prisoners Now in New York This proclamation , said the White'House , exercised the " traditional power of the Chief Executive " to deny the war-time enemies relief in the civil courts . Now held in New York City , the eight saboteurs will be brought here as soon as the Military Commission is ready to proceed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procedures and then recess for a day or two , unless , however , the prisoners should be prepared to plead guilty . To do so , it was suggested , might give them some opportunity to conceal some of their secret plans and afford a hope of mercy before the tribunal . Pleas of guilty would not mandatorily prevent imposition of a death sentence , it was said in Army circles . The generals , it was added , could decide upon whatever penalty they deemed fitting , even to the extent of a firing squad or hanging . Action Allays Fears of Delay Appointment of a Military Commission met with general satisfaction in Washington , as it will throughout the country . The Presidential action calmed the fears of many who realized the delays and technicalities incident to civil trials . For instance , it was pointed out that had the two naturalized citizens been tried civilly for treason two witnesses would be necessary to substantiate the charge . Again , civil trial for sabotage would involve a maximum penalty of only thirty years . . Precisely when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was obviously problematical . The Lincoln conspiracy trial , only well-known precedent , even if any others exist , ran from early in May until early in July , Hooded , handcuffed and leg-ironed , those prisoners were tried before a commission of nine officers named by President Andrew Johnson . In the end , David E. Herold , George A. Atzerodt , Lewis Payne and Mrs. Mary E. Surratt were hanged , while Michael O'Laughlin , Edward Soangler , Samuel Arnold and Dr. Samue Al . Mudd were sent to the dreary Federal prison on the Dry Tortugas . Prisoners Questioned Here The eight Nazi saboteurs , two of them naturalized American citizens , will be removed from this city to Washington some time before Wednesday , the day on which they are to appear before the military commission . Since their capture the prison-ers have been under constant questioning by Federal Bureau of In-1 vestigation agents and Army and Navy Intelligence officers . For obvious reasons , none of the agents or officials would disclose the results of the questioning . All the persons arrested because they were known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landed in this country also have been interrogated . Although the agents have not disclosed any evidence other than that made public last Saturday night , they have sufficient information to warrant the belief that additional arrests will be made here and in other sections of the country . Since the arrest of the eight , key points in industry and transportation have been guarded more closely .
