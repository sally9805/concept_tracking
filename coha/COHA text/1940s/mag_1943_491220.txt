THE DONO FALL PRIC IICE MIKE By ALVA JOHNSTON Born a Romanoff at the age of thirty , America 's leading impostor ( New York rogues ' gallery No. 63,967 ) has now disintegrated into an honest businessman . pRINCE MICHAEL ROMANOFF. the leading impostor of the twentieth century , has gone to pieces . The most iridescent scapegrace of our time has disintegrated into n successful businessman . This character , who was worthy to associate with the King and the Duke on Huck Finn 's raft , today owns and operates Romanoirs Restaurant at 326 North Rodeo Drive , Beverly Hills , California . Mike , now fifty-three years old , was the cousin of the late Czar Nicholas . He was the morganatic son of Czar Alexander III . He was the man who killed Rasputin and the son of the man who killed Rasputin . He was Prince Obolensky , Count Gladstone and Count de Rochernoride ; Captain Dmitri , Captain Shaughnessy and Captain Chitterin ; Rockwell Kent , William K. Vanderbilt and William Rockefeller . Also Prof. John William Adams , of Yale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wellington , Fleming , Brighton , Ferguson and Gerguson . The entire cast of characters has now boiled down into a restaurateur . " Restaurateur " used to be the most abusive epithet in the prince 's vocabulary . The first Hollywood exposure of the scintillating mountebank was made in 1927 by Gen. Theodor Lodijenaky , art aristocratic Russian refugee who ran the Russian Eagle Restaurant in New York City and later in Hollywood . The general presented film executives , who employed the Prince Michael Pomoneff ; alias Count Gladstone , Prince Obalensky , Captain Dmitri , Prof. John W. Adams , Arthur Wellesley , Willoughby do Burke , William A. Wellington . 9 CSNR 1.11124TXR prince as an authority on Russia , with evidence that Mike was neither a prince nor a Russian ; that he had been in jail five times in England ; that he was described by the French police as a habitual perpetrator of " eseroquerie , - meaning " picayune fraud " ; that he was known to the New York police as Harry Gerg-uaon , of the lower East Side origin  --  No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called in Mike to- listen to General Lodijeneky 's story . The prince was amused . - I believe you 're a restaurateur , " he said . The aristocratic Russian cringed as if Mike had put the brand of Cain on him . The executives squirmed . The prince dismissed them with a careless flip of his hand  --  a characteristic Romanoff gesture said to have originated in Peter the Great 's habit of throwing beef hones over his shoulder at state banquets . Mike became a scourge of restaurateurs when he was born into the Romanoff family at the age of thirty years . He has probably had more champagne and pheasant on bad checks than any other living man . He has helm in residence , " as he calls it , on bad-check charges in Paris . Cannes , Grasse , New York , Cambridge , Kansas City , Salt Lake City , Los Angeles and many other places . During his palmy days , the prince sold hand-painted old masters for Fifth Avenue dealers . He spent several months in the Tombs after pocketing the proceeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealer said later that nothing had ever hurt him like prosecuting the prince . " He is one of the most remarkable men alive , " said Mieheelyan . " I believe his name will go down in history . Maybe mine will go down in history with him . " Micheelyan is a disappointed man . He has little chance of going down the ages with a restaurateur . Others who hoped for an honorable mention in the Romanoff epic have the same complaint . There are extenuating circumstances . Mike grosses more than $25,000 a month . He has more celebrities in his restaurant than his adopted ancestors ever had in their palaces . Nevertheless , there is a tragic side to it . It is like Casanova 's sad end /LB a respectable librarian or Micawber'e finish as a prosperous judge . A few years ago , when his life was one exposure after another , Mike used to say that he was a social barometer  --  that only the phonies and upstarts could n't afford to be seen with him . Today he is a sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grade when they receive a curt nod or a few gruff words from the illustrious publican . His list of backers is perhaps the most glittering catalogue of big names that ever supported a small enterprise . Most of the backers , however , contributed only fifty dollars apiece  --  the price of one share of stock . Few of them expected a restaurant to develop out of it . They regarded it as one of Mike 's scientific methods of making a touch . Many framed the certificate as a landmark in the art of dignified mooching . The biggest investors were Robert Benchley and John Hay Whitney , $350 each ; Charlie Chaplin and Rex St. Cyr , $250 each ; Ja nes Cagney , $200 . Charlie Chaplin 's interest in Mike L9 obvious . The character that Mike created and the little tramp that Chaplin created are practically identical twins . They have the same physique and psychology , the same resourcefulness , audacity , nonchalance and intrepidity . The little prince has foiled the Federal authorities as frequently as the little tramp has baffled Mack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a place in a social system which uselessly threw them out . John Hay Whitney made his investment partly because of friendship for Mike and partly because of a driving ambition to get rid of his wealth . As soon as the shares threatened to pay dividends , he gave them back to Mike in terror , So did Benehley . By gifts and purchase , Mike eventually acquired 51 per cent of the stock . Benchley has backed Romanoff enterprises for years . For Mike 's use on one of his stowaway voyages to France , Benchley wrote a To Whom it May Concern letter , enjoining the officials of all nations not to bother the prince . The letter stated that Mike had not stowed away thoughtlessly , but was engaged in important research work on the stowaway problem . Mike is accepted in Hollywood as the top man in his line . The fact that his Line is imposture does n't matter . J There is nothing wrong with imposture in the world capital of make-believe . Clark Gable is the first actor , Myron Selznick the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . W. C. Fields the first comic , Louis B , Mayer the first magnate , Mike Romanoff the first impostor . Nobody makes invidious distinctions among their fields of endeavor . Some of the czarlet 's admirers credit him with making snobbery and title worship ridiculous in America . They consider it a healthy thing that a bootleg prince from the lower East Side should make himself more famous and sought after than any of the genuine imported noblemen . Mike sold a little more than $6000 worth of stock and induced a capitalist to build the restaurant . Shortage of funds caused the prince to act as his own interior desecrator . He beautified the place chiefly with portraits of himself . He got moat of his tableware from a five-and-ten store , traded the furniture of his apartment for a refrigerator , borrowed a few hottlee of liquor , and obtained the use of $260 for one night , so that he could make change . The first night was big . The high spot of the evening came when a waiter presented the first bank check from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has been no mean artist in passing bad checks himself , seemed stunned to find himself on the receiving end of suspicious paper . He peered at the check like a connoisseur expertizing a dubious Rembrandt . Pinching a corner of it between his thumb and forefinger , he held it up to the light and peered at it again . His eyes became unfocused and his jaws worked . It was like the fluttering of the eagle that was hit by an arrow tipped with its own feathers . Finally Mike pulled himself together , gave a brisk nod and scribbled " O.K. MR " on the check . Mike astonished students of his career with his diligent attention to business . He is a perfect restaurateur , except that he has never learned the technique of measuring out his courtesy in exact accord with the customer 's importance . After one has been an heir apparent , the difference between a star and an extra is negligible . The best tables and service go to the prince 's oldest followers , whether they are riding high or nut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Jack Benny , Robert Taylor and Barbara Stanwyck were waiting for a table . The waiter , fresh from New York , where many a restaurateur would pay ; 1000 to get such a party into his place , expected the prince to rush up to them , bowing and scraping and making a tremendous fuss . " The hell with ' em , " said Mike . Mike 's neighborhood consisted chiefly of vacant lots when he opened his restaurant . Within a year the street was dotted with little temples of commerce . Jewelers , art dealers and smart haberdashers moved in , so that their shop windows could catch the eye of Mike 's rich clientele . He doubled property values in his vicinity . Living up to his responsibilities as a pillar of the community , the prince gave a party in his restaurant which produced $2200 for Russian relief and another which raised $11,000 for the Red Cross . Mike left his restaurant last fall and went to Washington with some recipes for winning the war . During his stay in the capital , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counterpropaganda and counterespionage . His ideas were listened to , but he failed to get a war job which he had hoped for . It is difficult for the Government to deal with the prince . Mike 's international status is that of an independentnation with a population of one , He it a miniature commonwealth like Andorra or Monaco . Mike made a tactical error in his approach to the Government . He had a library of letters of recommendation from American notables . They portray the little prince as a sainted and spotless character . It happens that supernatural virtue is not the best qualification for outwitting foreign agents and fifth columnists . If the testimonials had set forth the fact that Romanoff had fooled more people than Ignatius T. T. Lincoln or any of the other great international spies , his services might have been snapped up . The Romanoff Riddle MIKE gave a convincing specimen of his talent for J.V1 exposing masqueraders . One of the popular figures in lively spots in Southern California was known as Lieutenant Commander Bernstein . When the man was at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pacific , Mike said . " He 's a phony . " People were shocked . They asked Romanoff bow he came to say such a thing . " I know a little about phonies , " said Mike diffidently . " This man sometimes forgets to limp . Besides , his checks bounce . " A few days later the FBI arrested Bernstein for masquerading ne a naval officer . Even in his own phoniest days , Mike was considered an infallible authority on other phonies . On his first arrival in New York as Prince Michael Romanoff in 1922 , he was in the midst of a large migration of Russian noblemen , genuine and otherwise . He conducted a sort of Heralds ' College in New York speakeasies. authenticating some of his rival princes , exposing others . At the period when princes were being imported from the Caucasus by matrimonial brokers for the heiress market , Mike was called on to appraise one shipment of them . " They 're perfectly genuine . " said Mike . " Genuine Caucaeian princes . Everybody in the Caucasus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a valid title , like your title of mister . " - Vhen one of his rivals died , Mike reported that the father of the deceased prince had inquired anxiously , " Do I inherit the title ? " Mike 's face gives no clue to his origin , Amateur ethnologists have puzzled about it for years , He made a mistake when he stepped into the vacancy in the Romanoff dynasty , as there is no trace of the Slav in him ; he would have been more plausible as the Great Mogul or the Akhuund of Swat . His eyes are black , his complexion leathery , his hair tightly crinkled and black , except for a sprinkling of gray , his nose long , straight and somewhat dented by knuckles and monogrammed by seal rings . His voice , a bassoon with an Oxford accent , throws no light on his origin . Neither does his carriage , which is the typical royal slouch , head bent forward , arms hanging well in front of the body , exactly as seen in the old newsreels of George V @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romanoff mystery is held by the residents of Hillsboro , Illinois , a town of 5000 about fifty miles northeast of St. Louis . The prince arrived there in 1904 as one of a batch of New York orphans who were being settled in rural communities . Mike , then known as Harry Gerglison , was taken in charge by Judge Kronck , a St. Louis lawyer who hod retired to a farm near Hillsboro . The judge sent him to a rural school . Here Mike adopted his first alias . The name of Gerguson sounded uncouth to Mike 's fellow students and subjected him to ridicule . He changed it to Ferguson . After a few months , Mike , or Harry , quit the Kronck farm and returned to Hillsboro . Here ho ran errands for meals , and slept in the Presbyterian churchyard . The idea of a boy 's sleeping out in the open  --  an unheard-of thing in Hillsboro  --  excited general sympathy . Family after family informally adopted the boy , but these arrangements soon broke up , both sides complaining of intolerable grievances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Main Street . This experience is thought to have been invaluable to him in later years . Mike insists that he was a student at Oxford for three years , but other authorities say that he worked there as a presser in a clothing-repair shop , while using his talent ns a mimic to acquire the British upper-class manner . At Hillsboro he attended the seventh grade and is remembered for his devotion to the Frank Carpenter geography books . He read these incessantly in class and stole them from the school library in ( Cordinued on Page 96 ) 96 THE DOWNFALL OF PRINCE MIKE ( corai ... 4 from Pagel order to read them at home . Continuing these studies in later years , he became an encyclopedia of travel . Experts who attempted to trap Mike in his tales of adventure in strange places found that it was like trying to trap Baedeker 's . Mike had a characteristic dream life at Hillsboro , but he developed no fancy lineage there . The nobility had been queered with the youth of America a few years earlier by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creatures on earth in the imagination of boys or fourteen or fifteen were the congressional pages . One day Mike bade farewell to his schoolteachers and friends , saying he was on the way to Washington to accept an appointment as a congressional page . He turned up a few days later at Litchfield , ten miles from Hillsboro , where he remained until he was haled into court for punching the superintendent of schools in the nose . He was then sent back to a New York orphanage . In 1910 the Hillsboro paper announced that he had turned into the sun of the late Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone . On March 20 , 1923 , Harry came back to Hillsboro with a monocle , Malacca stick and ' Clifford accent , and delivered a platform lecture on the war . He was a British lieutenant and had another man 's military papers to prove it . A few days later the St. Louis newspapers announced that St. Louis was entertaining royalty and printed pictures of Prince Michael Remanoff . Hillsboro people recognized the face in the papers as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prince was exposed by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch , On October 20 , 1936 , the little prince stopped at Hillsboro on his way to Hollywood . Running true to form , he was a greater celebrity after exposure than before . He received one of the highest local honors  --  that of standing on the platform in front of the courthouse and giving out the cash prizes on Trade Day . In Search of an Accent Mike was nineteen years old when he graduated from the New York orphanage . Having observed that the Oxford accent was the heaviest social artillery a man could have , he crossed the Atlantic on a cattle boat in order to acquire it . He spent years in England doggedly polishing himself . In 1915 he tried himself out prematurely on English society under the name of Willoughby de Burke and landed in jail . Ordered out of England in 1921 for impersonating and marauding , Mike became a spot of color at the Ritz bar in Paris , where he was taken up by wealthy Americans . Bad-check trouble in France caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrival here , he was detained at Ellie Island . The authorities thought that , although Mike had been in a New York orphan asylum at the age of three , his birthplace was Vilna . He was ordered deported for moral turpitude on his statement that he had spent eight years March 20 , 1942 in a German prison for killing a German baron in a duel at Heidelberg . A little later the prince disappeared from Ellis Island ; the Romanoff legend has it that he swam across New York harbor with a silk hat on , but the immigration men said he stowed away on a ferryboat . Little Brother of the Rich A few days after his escape , Mike changed into Prince Obolensky . New York newspapers printed a sympathetic interview with Obolensky on the troubles of an impoverished nobleman seeking employment . Everybody thought it a hilarious joke , he said , when he offered himself as a secretary , a clerk or a laborer . The interview won him some gaudy week ends , but no work . From there he went to St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kings . One of his rich frie , ids sent him to the Graduatk School of Arts and Sciences at Harvard . He represented the university on a chess tram and made a prodigious figure on the campus with his monocle , silk hat and sponge-bag knee pants , until he was expelled for falsely representing him . self to have been an Oxford student . A brief period of splendor at Newport ended in exposure at Reginald C. Vanderbilt 's bal masque . The gilded youth of Dim Moriarity 's speak-easy in New York made a comrade of Mike . Paul Mellon. son of Andrew W. Mellon , took the prince on a visit to Pittsburgh . Old families along the Hudson adopted Mike for spells of varying length . During vacations from the as tatee of million . aires , the prince lived by the sweat of his fountain pen . He seemed to have an honest conviction that he was the injured party every time he cashed a bad cheek ; that he was doing himself an injustice by parting with his autograph 83 cheaply . After he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1927 and papered Hollywood , He re-turned to Hollywood in 1931 and reps-pered it . He made the name of Romanoff so unworkable in Southern California that another impostor calling himself Prince Michael Romanoff , drowned himself at Redondo Beach . Mike is probably the only impostor in history who is benefited by exposure . His victims usually like him better as Gerguson than as Romanoff . Phoenix , St. Louie and a few other places still feel shooting pains in the old wounds when Mike reappears , but he is usually presented with the keys of the cities which he ravaged . Hotel men honor Mike because he saved them millions of dollars by forcing them to reorganize their protective system against agile fountain pens and itinerant potentates . Mike outmaneuvered the Federal authorities for the last time in 1932 . Claiming to be an American newspaperman assigned to interview Andrew W. Mellon , he stowed away on the Europa at Cherbourg and eluded the immigration inspectors in New York harbor . The little prince was unable to live without Royal Yacht pipe tobacco , which costa ten dollars a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from David , as he calls the present Duke of Windsor . He went to a Fifth Avenue shop for a tin of it and was arrested . ( Continued on Page 98 ) ( Confirmed from Pogo 96 ) Federal Judge John C. Knox and Assistant U. S. Attorney William B. Herlands took a sympathetic view of the case . Herlands described Mike as " a product of our public institutions " and said that he had " never had a chance . " He predicted that the defendant would go straight if released on a suspended sentence . Judge Knox ordered that no further effort should be made to deport Mike , but sentenced him to three months in jail for perjury . Romanoff , in order to shield friends who had helped to smuggle him in from the Europa , had falsely testified before a grand jury that he had entered this country by way of Canada . The judge and the prosecutor personally urged Mike to mend his ways . This humane treatment took effect . Roman-off has never been in any serious trouble since . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mike turned farmer . John Walters , a New York broker , bought an estate called Powhatan near Fredericksburg , Virginia , and put the prince in charge of it in 1935 . The farmhouse was in nuns . Sheep were living in it when Mike arrived there under the name of John William Adams . The prince , an indefatigable worker when the fit takes hold of him , repaired the house , cleared a field and made a road . His chief companions at Powhatan were a mare named Betty and a cat named Gerguson . Friends from Washington , who visited Mike shortly after Christmas , 1935 , found that he had set up two Christmas trees decorated with tinsel , colored globes and artificial snow for the mare and the cat , and had made presents of a package of sugar lumps to Betty and a quart of cream to Gerguson . Word spread , however , that Prof. John William Adams , of Yale , had isolated himself at Powhatan and was writing The Philosophy of History . The mystery about the newcomer continued until George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show , Mike went to Richmond for one of his big nights . The press agent of the Scandals told reporters that the prince was in town , and the Powhatan farmer was unmasked as the celebrated Roma noff- Gerguson . Mike quit Powhatan in 1936 . Arriving in New York , the prince said he was en route to Hollywood to make a pile of money , so that he could retire to his Virginia estate . Two friends gave Mike sixty dollars one night on his promise to take a bus westward the following day ; the following day the two friends discovered Mike in the Canadian minister 's box at an international polo game . Other friends gave him fresh money and a broken-down auto , and Mike made his way to Hollywood by slow degrees . Return From Elba The first man he met there  --  Leo Morrison  --  lent him ten dollars and took him to the Clover Club , where the cream of Hollywood welcomed him deliriously . It was Mike 's return from Elba . He was such an attraction that the management instructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for honoring them with his visits . This was Mike 's livelihood for months . After the Clover Club was closed , one of the leading night spots offered the prince seventy-five dollars a week to bring a party there four nights a week in order to give color to the place . Mike and his parties were free to eat and drink what they liked , but the little prince rejected the employment as too confining . Mike gradually established a good credit rating for himself in Hollywood . Frankly admitting that he had been a dangerous risk in the past , he asked Jim Oviatt , a leading clothier , to trust him with the meteoric wardrobe which is considered necessary to a meteoric career in Hollywood , Oviatt turned him into a sparkling bird of paradise , and later told everybody that no other customer had ever been so punctual in his monthly payments . Dave Chasen let Mike eat and drink on the cuff for months at a time , but the prince turned up periodically with a surprisingly good check and settled his account . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loans . His improved credit helped Romanoff when he opened his restaurant in December , 1940 . Some students of the prince 's career resented his transformation into an honest burgher , but the sordid truth is that the prince always had a bourgeois streak . Every now and then he used to disappear from New York , return with the proceeds of some obscure transaction and celebrate Restitution Day by paying back loans , squaring bad checks and reveling in middle-class integrity . He was a share-the-wealther when he had it . A friend who housed and fed Mike during tough days in New York is Frank Getty , now a publicity magician in Washington . On one of his trips abroad , Mike arrived in Paris with twenty dollars in the toe of his right shoe . The first man he met was Getty , who had gone broke writing the great American novel . As soon as Mike learned this , he took off the shoe and split fifty-fifty with his former patron . The finest example of Mike 's punctiliousness in money matters took place on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catherine the Great , in New York , February 1:3 , 1934 . Monroe Greenthal , the U.A. publicity chief , felt that the premiere of the movie about the great Romanoff empress would not be complete without the great Romanoff impostor . Mike agreed to appear if the picture company furnished him with the following inventory  --  a stunning blonde , $160 for a night 's spending money , a Rolls-Royce with a liveried chauffeur and footman , the footman to wear a tan stovepipe hat , tan coat with gold buttons , scarlet vest and knee-high tan boots with buff tops . All the items were furnished . After the premiere the prince took his consort , one of the reigning Powers models , to the Stork Club and El Morocco , where he drank double healths to Great-great-great-aunt Catherine until he had faithfully disbursed all the spending money except thirty dollars , with which he tipped his waiters. chauffeur and footman . Going home , he found that the management had plugged the keyhole to his door for nonpayment of rent . He spent the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mike is definitely bourgeois today on the subject of bad checks . All the humor has gone out of the No Funds stamp . His $25,000-a-month gross is painfully reduced by bouncing checks and moribund signatures . Mike has a lofty contempt for the present generation of frauds and mountebanks . They have never learned their trade , according to Mike ; anybody can read them like a book . One day when he was haranguing about the incompetency of the current crop of phonies , the prince was asked what advice he would give to a young phony just starting out . " I would advise him to stay out of it , " said Mike . " There 's too much competition . " The prince dislikes to take dead beats to court . A defendant most of his life , he still hates plaintiffs . Occasionally , however , he gets tough by proxy through a hardboiled headwaiter . Mike has changed with the times . He no longer conspires to re-enthrone the Romanoffs . He is satisfied with Stalin and is letting him stay . The little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Los Angeles , dined at Chasen 's instead of Romanoff 's . He never opened champagne faster than when he entertained Soviet officers on a mission to Southern California . Mike has never wholly abandoned the ermine , however . New people uftea ask him if he is really a prince . He replies , " There 's been a good deal of discussion about that . " He denies vehemently he is or ever was Harry Gerguson , and he hit a former New York Times cinema critic in the jaw for addressing him as " Mr. Gerguson . " A Hollywood producer with a seventeen-jewel , $7500-a-week brain recently told a friend that he had learned Mike was a genuine Russian prince . " How did you learn that ? " he was asked . " Mike told me so , confidentially , " said the producer . The prince trifles a little with his former greatness . Over the entrance for his restaurant he erected a plaster shield with a coat of arms consisting of champagne glasses , corks , a cocktail bar sinister and other emblems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of influenza , he called on Dr. Lee E. Siegel , saying , " The little monarch is ailing . " " What was that ? " asked the physician . " The prince is ill , " said Mike . Although he could jest in this way , he dismissed the trained nurse in a royal rage because she was no court beauty . The Royal Purple Mike will probably never quite get over being a Romanoff . His imposture was so thorough that he imposed on himself . When he had a room to live in , it was decorated with photographs of Nicholas II and his family . In one of these the Czar and Czarina were surrounded by relatives ; Mike used to point to a small , blurred , unrecognizable figure , saying , " Do n't I look ridiculous ? " Once when he was in Jim Moritu-ity 's speak-easy just off Fifth Avenue , immigration officers arrived with a warrant for Mike 's arrest . Moriarity told the prince he could escape through the kitchen , " A Romanoff escape through a kitchen ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did , " acid Moriarity . Honoring this precedent , Mike darted out through the kitchen . He once obtained work as assistant gardener at an estate on the Hudson River , where his Oxford accent and lordly manners created a mystery . In about a week the mystery was solved . The laundry maid carried Mike 's silk undershirt to the mistress of the house ; embroidered on it was the Romanoff coat of arms . The little gardener was badgered into a confession that he was Prince Michael of all the Hussies and promoted to a guest chamber , where he remained for months . Later he was clearly demonstrated to be a fake , but his hostess had become so charmed with him that she insisted on his staying anyway . His voluntary departure at a later date excited general regret . When Mike was unconscious of everything else , he was still conscious that he was a Romanoff . The classic Romanoff line was uttered in the Great Northern Hotel in New York , where the late Jack Thomas , author of Dry Martini , Stanley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning after a speakeasy evening . The prince seemed to be dying . His friends thought a bottle of milk would save him . As he was being propped up in bed to drink it , Mike seized the bottle and smashed it against the wall . " What the hell ! " he shouted . " G rade B milk for a Romanoff ! " The Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Company purchased the movie rights to Mike 's life in 1932 . Several scripts were written but the picture was not made , partly because the prince 's career violated the unities and partly because a good comedy finish was difficult , in view of the Hays rule that transgressors must be punished in the last reel . Harry D'Arrast , the famous director and one of the prince 's oldest friends , wrote a version with a tragic ending based on Mike 's invincible belief in his own royalty . In this version Mike turns up in Russia and is captured by Soviet soldiers . As ho is led before the firing squad , he is told , " If you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will go free and be welcomed as a comrade . " The prince shakes his head scornfully and ie executed .
