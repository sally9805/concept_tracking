In Manhattan 's Mount Sinai Hospital last week , a crowd of doctors from all over the eastern U. S. stared fixedly at a glass jar suspended above a patient 's bed . The patient had syphilis . From the bottom of the jar , a yellowish fluid trickled through a flexible glass tube into a needle inserted in the vein between his elbow and wrist . Proudly the patient grinned at his distinguished guests , flexed his arm . Snapped his nurse : " Do n't show off . " The apparatus was an ordinary " Murphy drip , " long used for glucose feedings . <P> In the jar was no ordinary fluid , but a sugary solution of mapharsen , one of the earlier of the 950-odd arsenic compounds invented by Paul Ehrlich . While the drug gently seeped into the patient 's veins ( two drops every three seconds ) , young Dr. William Leifer explained to the visitors one of the most remarkable advances in the treatment of syphilis since Chemist Ehrlich discovered arsphenamine ( 606 ) . <P> With the drip method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be cured in five days . <P> So powerful is arsphenamine that doctors can give it only in single doses extending over a period of 18 months . <P> But by slowly dripping its weaker relative , mapharsen , into the bloodstream for eight hours a day , Drs . Hyman and Leifer and the third associate , Dr. Louis Chargin , eliminate the " shock " of relatively large injections , build up blood tolerance to huge concentrations of the essential arsenic . During a five-day treatment , a patient absorbs about two and a half gallons of mapharsen solution . <P> The doctors first tried neoarsphenamine in their Murphy drip , but found it " too dangerous . " Mapharsen , which is less toxic , was discarded by Ehrlich because it was too unstable . But modern chemists have " set " the drug . <P> In the last seven years Dr. Hyman et al . have treated 376 syphilitic men . <P> Score : 375 cured , one lost . Mostly charity cases , patients were paid a dollar to return to the hospital for regular checkups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some patients , said Dr. Hyman , need a second five-day treatment after several months . The entire course costs only $82 a patient , as contrasted with an average of $300 for the standard 18 months of arsphenamine injections . Drawback to mass cures of the 600,000 victims of early syphilis in the U. S. is the fact that drip technique can be used only in hospitals , not in doctors ' offices .
