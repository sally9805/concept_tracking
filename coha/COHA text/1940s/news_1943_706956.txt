txt Comment on Dr. Bowie 's Article Situation Not Fully Met I am glad to have seen Professor Bowie 's article in THE NEW YORK TIMES Magazine , if only as some antidote to Rex Stout 's article of last week . The latter article seemed to me pretty unfortunate . I suppose its justification is that it represented a viewpoint . But surely that is not , never was and never will be a Christian or religious viewpoint . And even on th " basis of the pragmatic philosophy upon which it was based it did not meet the situation . Of Mr. Stout 's thesis it might well be said : " Honesty is the best policy . I 've tried both . " The world has tried Mr. Stout 's nostrum of hate , too . I do not think that Professor Bowie 's article fully meets the situation . The brotherhood of man needs as its logical basis the common fatherhood of God . It is not pious or mealy-mouthed to say so . It is merely sensible . H .. GREGOBY MILLER . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
