Of all the nation 's art students , from discontented debutantes to determined G.I.s , only a handful will ever make the grade . But the future of U.S. art rests with that handful . Last week the Addison Gallery at Andover , Mass. staged a sneak preview of what some of the more promising students are up to . Gallery Director Bartlett Hayes Jr . had arranged a similar cross-section show last year ( TIME , Aug. 16 , 1948 ) ; this year he invited 25 schools not represented in the first exhibition to submit their prize work . The entries covered the U.S. from Oregon to Alabama , included a smattering of good pictures , most of which turned out to have been painted by students in their late 20s . <P> One of the best in the show , a tempera House by the Seashore ( see cut ) by the University of Wisconsin 's Ray Obermayr , owed an obvious debt to the two living U.S. masters : Charles Burchfield and Edward Hopper . It struck a low blue note characteristic of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painted a lonely little figure through the bars of a fire escape , called it Insignificance . The Portland Museum School 's Robert Galaher had wrapped his hulking Circus Worker in a sad , smokelike haze , and Milwaukee 's John Pagac had contributed a fatly photographic Self-Portrait that might have been inspired by reflections in a beer bottle on a morning-after . <P> Such dead-earnest studies as Joel Reeves 's shadowy Still Life in Green and Bruno Sepka 's oil of a snowed-in tenement district which he called Man 's Houses , raised the exhibition 's level of technical competence but did nothing to lighten the atmosphere . Minneapolis ' Walker Art Center sent six paintings that demonstrated how diversely students in a progressive art school will advance . They ranged from Reginald Anderson 's Figures , a spiky , thin-air abstraction , to Roland Thompson 's carefully realistic Culvert . William Chaiken 's patchwork Tryst at the Fountain ( see cut ) was painted at Manhattan 's Art Students League , showed the weary sophistication that comes with spending a lot of time in big-city galleries . <P> All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much fun . Andover 's cross section was grey as the dawn , but like the dawn it might be a preview of brighter things .
