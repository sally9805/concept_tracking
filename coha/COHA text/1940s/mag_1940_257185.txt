When the movies came into U. S. life , band concerts , vaudeville , parlor games faded out . So did roller skating . But in the past few years , roller skating has come rumbling back again . <P> Last week skaters whirred around some 3,000 U. S. rinks , from Skowhegan to San Diego , from Atlanta to Seattle . The skaters in Detroit 's Arena Gardens , largest of the city 's four roller rinks , were especially gay . For they were celebrating the fifth anniversary of the Arena Gardens Roller Skating Club ( membership 5,000 ) and honoring portly , fiftyish Fred Martin , the man mainly responsible for all this fun on wheels . <P> Fred Martin started out as a hand-organ grinder in a San Francisco roller-skating rink , climaxed his whirring career by winning a roller marathon in Manhattan 's Madison Square Garden ( 309 miles in 24 hours ) , then settled down to the swivel-chair job of managing rinks . When he took over Detroit 's million-dollar Arena Gardens , he began to angle for tonier patronage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shoddy roller rinks . He caught both fish . <P> Three years ago , hearing that Londoners danced on roller skates , Manager Martin got England 's famed roller-skating Ridstones , James &; Joan , to tour the U. S. Their spellbinding exhibition of figure skating started America 's roller-skating boom . Today most roller skaters , instead of going round &; round in the old-fashioned way , do the Chicken Scratch , the Howdy-Do and other " called-out " ( square ) dances , waltz , tango and fox-trot in pairs . More ambitious skaters learn to do rockers and counters , brackets and loops , hope to be able some day to compete in the annual April tournament of the R. S. R. O. A. ( Roller Skating Rink Owners Association ) , the governing body of the sport . <P> Figure skating on rollers is similar to figure skating on blades-except that roller skaters use the heel &; toe where ice skaters use the blade 's edges . Both have approximately the same 41 school figures . At the Arena Gardens , which " skate about 6,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers a half hour 's free instruction in figure skating , elementary or advanced dancing every night . His 30-year-old son Bob and 19-year-old daughter Marjorie , aided by two other professionals , teach figure skating all day , at 50 to $1.50 for a 20-minute lesson . The Martins get requests for their dance routines from as far away as Australia , mail their monthly magazine , the Detroit Roller Skater , to 14 countries on four continents .
