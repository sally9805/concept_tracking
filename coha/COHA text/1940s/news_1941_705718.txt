txt Republican charges that the occupation of Iceland was an illegal step toward an undeclared war and that hundreds of American workmen already were constructing another naval base in Northern Ireland , the Senate Naval Affairs Committee today called on Secretary Knox for a full report of the Navy 's past and present actions in the Battle of the Atlantic . Expressing concern over published reports that the Navy already has fired at German submarines and a desire to know what President Roosevelt meant by ordering the Navy to " insure the safety of communications in the approaches between Iceland and the United States as well as on the seas between the United States and all other strategic outposts , " members of the committee voted to call Admiral Harold R. Stark , Chief of Naval Operations , as well as Secretary Knox , before an , , executive session tomorrow . Chairman Walsh said that he would ask Secretary Knox for a clear answer to wriden reports that the Navy already had engaged in a " shooting war , " and other members of the committee said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new naval instructions announced by Mr. Roosevelt . From the minute the Naval Affairs Committee came out of today 's executive session it was clear that non-interventionist Senators intended to protest not only about the American occupation of Iceland but also about the present relationship between the White House and Congress . Senator Taft - of Ohio opened the attack by charging that " the President has no legal or constitutional right to send American troops to Iceland " and bringing up a report that the United States was constructing a naval air base for Great Britain in Northern Ireland . Declaring that the real purpose of the Iceland occupation was not the defense of the United States but the defense of ships going from North America to Great Britain , Mr. Taft said that a base in Ireland would be much more effective to protect shipping than a base in Iceland . " Weeks ago I heard on reliable authority that the United States was constructing a naval-air base for Great Britain in Northern Ireland , " he said . " Since I made the first draft of this speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced that in his opinion we should establish military bases both in Northern Ireland and in Scotland . " Every argument that has been used for the occupation of Iceland applies to Ireland and England and Portugal . " This line was followed by Senator Danaher of Connecticut , who declared that " every one of us who chooses to can know that American workmen by the hundreds have been - constructing a naval base in Northern Ireland for weeks . " Neither Mr. Taft nor Mr. Danaher stated directly that this base was for the use of United States . forces , nor did they state . the source of their information . But Mr. Taft said he understood that the base was to cost $40,000,000 to $50,000,000 . . . . . Mr. Taft protested against every point in the administration 's Iceland argument . The President 's legal powers , he said , were limited to the defense of the United States and of its citizens and their property , but the landing of troops in Iceland had nothing to do with the protection of American life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President were justified in this act , Mr. Taft contended , then , he could by the same token use his powers as Commander in Chief to order the Army or Navy to land on the , German coast . " The landing of troops in Iceland is an act exactly equivalent to aggressive war , " he continued . " We are sending 80,000 American soldiers into the midst of a war zone , on foreign soil . " Historically and geographically , Iceland is a part of Europe and we are now intervening in Europe . We are now for the first time taking an active military part in the war between England and Germany . " Asserting that the Lend-Lease Act specifically disclaimed any intention to send troops anywhere to effect its policy , he concluded : " It seems to me that the course of the ? Administration is a delib-. erate course of involving this country in war without submitting the , question to the people because of the fear that the people will not approve . " In reply , Senator Connally of Texas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Foreign Relations Committee , said that Senator Taft was confusing the President 's rights as Commander in Chief of the armed forces with ' the right of Congress to declare war . Thumbing through several large volumes on his desk and calling on the clerks for more references , Mr. Connally read the constitutional dictum that the President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army ail the ' avy . If Congress could tell the President that he should not send the Navy to Iceland , continued Mr. Connally , then ' Congress and not the President would be commander of the Navy and the President could not exert his right and duty to send the Navy " out upon the high seas wherever ' the interests of the people of the United States require that it'be sent ; wherever the lives or the property Of the Citizens of the United States may be endangered . " Mr. Connally reminded Mr. Taft that previous Presidents had sent the Marines Or Navy to foreign countries over a hundred times and asked : " If we can send the Marines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why can we not send some Marines up to Iceland to protect the safety of the people Of the United States and to assert the right ' of our people to the freedom of the seas ? " ' " I hope to God we do n't have to fight , but we must let the gang-. sters and assassins know that if we have to fight we will . fight ? " he shouted . " I think it is unfortunate that in such a time We . Can not have some unanimity of opinion back of the - President of the United States , " he , concluded . " This sniping and bushwacking and guerrilla warfare  --  this , is no time for that . There is no election on now and I plead with the Sena-1 tor from Ohio ' to withhold his fire. , " We are in a very critical position . We have already taken this step ; it has been taken by the constitutional authority of the Presi : . dent of the United States and the Congress ought to back him up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Senator Danaher accused Senator Connally of ' " frivolity " - in his speech . All the Senate . needed to complete the perforniance , he said ; was " Governor O'Daniel 's hillbilly band . " - " Why can not we in the Senate of the United States know what is the objective of the Administration , to the end that we shall know what we are called upon to defend ? " he asked .
