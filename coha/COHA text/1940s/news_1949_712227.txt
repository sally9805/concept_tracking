txt ANTI-POLL TAX BILL IS PASSED BY HOUSE BY VOTE OF 273416 Action First of Session on Any Major Feature of Truman 's Civil Rights Program FAILURE IN SENATE LIKELY Southerners Lose Fight to Let Matter Be Handled by States or Constitutional Change By CLAYTON KNOWLES Special to Tea NEW Yoluc Tuns . WASHINGTON , July 26 ? The Norton bill outlawing exaction of a poll tax as a requirement for voting in Federal elections swept through the House today , 273 to 116 . The action was the first by either house of Congress at this session on any major feature ofl President Truman 's civil rights program , sent to Capitol Hill almost a year and a half ago . Similar measures were passed by the House in four previous Congresses , only to die in the Senate . With the same prospect likely this year , there was little elation as the bill finally passed the House . The margin , as on earlier occasions , was better than two to one , although somewhat smaller than the 294-to-112 vote by which the House passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ margin for the bill today was less than the final vote would indicate , for the opposition made its best showing on a Republican-sponsored motion to recommit . This motion , offered by Representative Robert Hale of Maine , was defeated 266 to 123 . South Leads Fight Southern Democrats , led by the Representatives of the seven poll- I tax states ? Alabama , Arkansas , Mississippi , South Carolina , Ten- , nessee , Texas and Virginia  --  were the principal opponents of the bill . But on the final vote even the representation from the poll-tax states was not solid in opposition . Ninety-two Democrats , all but seven of them from the South , and twenty-four Republicans were recorded in the negative . One hundred fifty-one Democrats , 121 Republicans and one American Laborite voted for the bill . The Southerners who spearheaded the opposition fought the bill chiefly on the grounds of constitutionality . They contended // HOUSE VOTES BILL TO BAN POLL TAX // throughout two days of debate that abolition of the poll tax was either a matter for the ' states or for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Labor party member , of New York , blocked a late-hour move by the opposition , fraught with danger to the bill , to have the measure recommitted with instructions to the committee to report it forthwith in the form of a resolution for a constitutional amendment . Speaker Sam Rayburn upheld Mr. Marcantonio 's position that the motion was not germane since it went beyond the jurisdiction of the House Administration Comm ' : - tee . Mr. Hale then sought straight recommittal . The Southerners fought two committee amendments to the bill , sponsored by Mary T. Norton , Democrat , of New Jersey , chairman of the House Administration Committee , but waged their hardest battling for changes proposed by their own group . The first and pivotal amendment , offered by Representative ' Sam Hobbs of Alabama , proposed ' that the bar against the poll tax apply only in general elections and not in primaries . This amendment was beaten , 87 to 62 , on a teller vote , in which members are not recorded individually . Representative Tom Pickett of Texas then sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconstitutional , rather than unlawful , to prevent anyone from voting because of non-payment of the poll tax . This amendment lost , 88 to 63 , on a standing vote . Another Pickett amendment would have stricken a section of the bill making it unlawful for any individual , regardless of local law , to . require payment of the levy as a prerequisite of voting . This was beaten , 38 to 63 , on a teller vote . Debate at times was heated . Representative Harry J. Davenport , Democrat , of Pennsylvania , ridiculing the Southern plea to let Southern States handle the situation themselves , declared the plea was " nothing but a ruse , a trick by which they hope to petpetuate the poll tax . " Mr. Davenport told the House that Representative John E. Rankin of Mississippi , a leader or the opposition to the bill , was elected by about 2 per cent of the eligible voters in his district in 1946 . To this Mr. Rankin replied that the real vote in the South was in the primary and not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he waited twenty years to make this speech , Mr. Rankin complimented him " for putting in twenty years accumulating so much ignorance .
