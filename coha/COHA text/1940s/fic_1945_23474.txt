Gerald Kersh joined the Coldstream Guards in 7940 and served in the Libyan campaign . " Mr. Pude and Mr. Mann " is taken from a forthcoming novel to be called Faces in a Dusty Picture . MR . PRYDE AND MR . MANN A Story GERALD KERSH R. MANN stands outside the Hotel Bristol , gently ruminant , a man of books , mature yet virginal , heavy with the fruits of other men 's experience ; mildly astonished like an artificially inseminated cow . He looks up and down the large , long street , observing the hard white light and hard black shadows . Cairo , he feels , might be a gracious and pleasant place if it were not simmering like a pot with unrest . The people who are walking seem , to Mr. Mann , to be in a little too much of a hurry , while those who are standing still are not sufficiently relaxed . It is as if somebody had told them to stand at ease : they might be waiting for a warning roar and an ear-splitting bark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to move to the right or to the left . . . or God help them . A fat man , a prosperous Arab , raises his head , half cringing , to look at the sky as an airplane Flies over ; his fez slips . A man who is following him at the shafts of a handcart hastily loaded with valuables also looks up . From the back of the cart a piece of tapestry trails in the dust . Mr. Mann smiles a little , looks at his wrist watch , gazes Ieft and right again . More airplanes pass . The street is too full of people . There are women with bundles : stained with the sweat and dust of strenuous journeys they blink helplessly at the upper windows on both sides of the street . Where are they to go ? Mr. Mann shakes his head . A Copt , fat and solemn , leads past a melancholy procession of women and children , all crying and talking and carrying bundles . The smallest child struggles under a cooking pot : he has put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark , holding on to the garment of the little boy in front of him . Presently the little boy with the pot over his head wanders into the road and a car pulls up with a scream of brakes while a voice from the driver 's seat screams abuse . Mr. Mann feels that he ought to do something about this , but before he can bring himself to the pitch of action a thin soldier with the kind of face one associates with a quick quarrel and a hasty blow reaches out a hand as brown and dry as a bundle of cinnamon sticks , hooks the boy with one forefinger , drags him back , smacks his bottom , and sends him on his way . Mr. Mann , of the Royal Archers , who wears the two pips of a full lieutenant , pretends not to see . He smiles and waits . He is a gentleman who looks upon mankind as a cast in a super-spectacle , and sees each day as an installment in a vivid and enthralling serial story  --  a fragment of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is one of those keenly observant , objectively interested men whom the whole world seems to pelt with interesting facts and figures  --  a lucky lotus-eater reclining under the Tree of Knowledge . Everything comes his way : as soon as a thing is ripe it drops into his mouth . People wonder why such a man has drifted into a common regiment of foot-sloggers , a roughhouse mob like the Archers , recruited from the hard , dour men of the Midlands  --  obstinate men , grim and joyless , hard to train , slow to trust a stranger , glum and suspicious of new faces . Mr. Mann might easily have got himself a safe , even an interesting job . He speaks four languages fluently , although he has never troubled to acquire any accuracy of accent ; it is more important to Mann that he shall understand than that he shall be understood . Intelligence , for example , would have jumped at him . So would any of the Ministries . He could have wangled something , with his qualifications ; it is whispered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no need for him to get tied up in the messy , dangerous , and uncomfortable side of the war ; obviously he is an eccentric , for here he stands , idly watching the terrified refugees as they hurry out of the line of the German advance into Egypt . His friend Mr. Pryde has always found Mann fascinating in his clear intelligence , but irritating in his imperturbability . He knows everything , good and bad , and cares about nothing . Pryde feels vaguely aggrieved at Mann 's smiling acceptance of life and death . He ought to worry more , discard a little of his philosophy , grumble about something , express a hate . As for the men , they like Mann because he is sensible and courteous , but they have no great faith in him as a soldier  --  they ca n't quite see him with a revolver smoking in one muddy fist , waving his unoccupied arm and shouting : " Come on , boys , let 's give the bastards hell ! " He is what they call dead cushy ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man he does it perfunctorily , with a certain . half-amused , half-apologetic half-smile that seems to say : I do n't give a damn whether you are late for parade or not ; if it rested with me you could go and play housie-housie , and good luck to you . Nothing ever seems to mattermuch to Mr. Mann . His commanding officer has something like affection for him , but can not help thinking that it would do no harm if Mann assumed , for the duration of the war at least , something of a military manner , and tried to look more like a fighting man and less like the kindly and affable gentleman of independent means that he is . Anyway , what the devil does the man want to come out here at all for , the CO wonders ; the fellow has a Science Degree . . . . Why the hell does n't he go and make poison gas , or liquid fire , or high explosive , as a good-natured and sweetly smiling gentleman of education should ? But Mann does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is speaking to him directly , he is only half listening  --  always half smiling  --  and thinking of some irrelevancy . The last time the Colonel spoke to Mann , for example , he almost burst out laughing as he remembered that the men had nicknamed the Colonel " Stinkpot " ; the Colonel had glared at him from under sulphur-colored eyebrows and his mustache had thrust itself upwards and outwards  --  a ferocious blond mustache stained by cigarette smoke to the color of an old Malacca cane . " And what , exactly , is the joke , Mr. Mann ? " ? " I beg your pardon , sir , no joke at all . . . . " The Colonel 's nickname is " Stinkpot " ; the Medical Officer , Probyn-Tweed , is called " the Plumber , " or " the Vet " ; the Regimental Sergeant Major is " the Black Bastard " ; Mr. Pryde is " Little Putrid , " or most frequently " Pute " for short ; General Eagles is called " Tomtit " ; Captain Tobin is called " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as " the Old Woman , " or " Mother Mann . " He manages to acquire such crumbs of knowledge , picking them up in his polished way as a boot picks up dust . A strange man , this , standing outside the Hotel Bristol and peering benevolently at a terrified and chaotic world while he beats a little tattoo with his stick on his calf and waits for Pryde. p RYDE comes . Mann sees him hurrying across the street  --  a short , dark , compressed-looking man . Glancing at his face , you first notice his eyebrows , which are furry and mobile as hairy black caterpillars butting head to head over a beaky nose . Although he is young there are lines on his face , especially on his forehead . He is a tense little man with an air of resolution , walking purposefully with a stiff back  --  not a soldier 's back , but a deliberately stiffened back which he holds straight with a conscious effort . A passing soldier out of his company salutes Pryde , who returns the salute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his eyes and snaps off a couple of words that sound like " Good morning , " but look like " Damn you . " His voice , unlike that of Mann , which is gently hesitant , cracks like a whip  --  like a whip that is cracked by a man who is not quite certain of the technique of getting a crack out of a whip and who overexerts himself in the attempt . " Aha , Mann ! " he says . " Hallo , Pryde , " says Mann . " What do you say to a drink ? " " Here ? " " Here or anywhere you like . " So they go into the hotel , under a chastely lettered sign which says " BRESTOL BAR . " As they walk downstairs Mann says : " We might as well have just one very Last one . " At this Pryde looks at him sharply ; he does not like the sound of " very last , " but he says nothing . Two exceedingly beautiful ladies pass them . Behind the ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle and brushed sideways , a gentleman who seems to have as many years and honors as one man can possibly carry . " Prybilov , " says Mann : " Who 's he ? " " What ? Have n't you heard of Prybilov ? Ninety years old , worth a hundred million francs at least ; made it out of perfume  --  Cr4uscule de Prybilov and all that kind of thing  --  terrible muck , stinks most abominably , only he sold it in the most magnificent bottles of the most bizarre shapes you ever saw in your life . He looks like an ambassador or something , does n't he ? But the fact of the matter is that he used to be a chemist of some kind , an apothecary , you know , in MAGAZINE Moscow . Odd , do n't you think ? Amusing . . " " How the devil do you find out all these things ? " " It really is very odd , " says Mann , tapping a cigarette on a little silver case  --  a gesture which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed how women ? and men too for that matter  --  like to make themselves smell of something else . Dead violets , squashed roses , the sexual organs of musk deer , the anus of weaselly little civet cats , ambergris out of the guts of sperm whales ? " " Oh , all right , all right , Mann , all right ! " " So sorry ; was I annoying you ? " " At a time like this , you start rambling about stuff like that ! " Mann smiles indulgently , and pats Pryde 's shoulder . " Why , Pryde , old fellow ! What 's the matter with you now ? " " Nothing at all 's the matter with me . : . . I say , Mann , do be a good fellow and either light that damned cigarette or put it away ! Tap-tap-tap ; fiddle-fiddle-fiddle ! " Mann lights it " You need a drink , " he says . " I 'm sorry , " says Pryde , ashamed . " Ah , well , " says Mann , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improbable that you or I will see as many years or francs to our credit as Prybilov can count . " " Why drag that up ? " Pryde 's hand is unsteady ; there are dark marks under his eyes . As THEY sit down Mann makes gestures . With his thin fingers he holds an imaginary tumbler , squirts an imaginary siphon , drops in imaginary ice . Then his smiling lips pucker at an imaginary straw . The barman , grinning , understands perfectly , and makes two gin fizzes , while Pryde drums with his fingers on his knees . The bar is full of officers . Men are shaking hands with an indefinable air of finality ; their handshakes are longer and tighter than usual . The barman is doing well in tips . As Pryde , having gulped his drink , tries to catch his eye , a lanky subaltern throws down a banknote and says : " There you are , George ; buy yourself a gaudy necktie or something , to remember me by . " " Hope to be seeing you again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unctuous enjoyment , " My Lord . " " What 's this , Teddy ? " asks Mann . " Since this morning , " says the subaltern . " My name is now Hazlitt : no Christian name , just Hazlitt , fourth Baron , and last of my line . A Lord , you vulgar beasts ; a Peer of the Realm . Shake hands . Feel that ! " He holds out a big hand . " No common flesh and blood there , Manny boy . I wander whether my blood 's gone blue . We 'll know soon enough  --  eh , Pryde ? " " I 'm sorry your father ? " " You would n't be if you 'd known him , Prydey boy . I 'm not . So bear up and have a drink . " His wink sends George the barman leaping like a galvanized frog at the bottles on the shelves . A big silvery cocktail shaker rattles and bounces ; the barman juggles with it , throws it from hand to hand , twirls it like a drum major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hah , " sighs Pryde , emptying his glass at a gulp . " Thirty thousand a year , " says Hazlitt . " Thirty thousand pounds . Every year , thirty thousand pounds . And now , all of a sudden , I 'm scared to death I 'll get killed before I have a chance to lay hands on it . Or crippled , say . You could n't get much fun out of even that much money if you only had one leg , or if  --  Christ ! ? if a stray splinter cut off your ? " " Stop it , " says Pryde . " Is everybody going morbid today ? " " Ah , " says Mann , with mock solemnity , " the conqueror 's prize is dust and lost endeavor , and the beaten man remains a story forever . . " He orders another round of drinks ; alcohol makes him very happy ; he seems to want to dance . " Dust and lost endeavor my foot , " says Hazlitt . " Ah , Captain Probyn-Tweed ! Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Captain ProbynTweed . The presence of this hard-faced medical officer chills Pryde , who sits still and looks at the floor ; but Probyn-Tweedeyes him closely and says : " Feeling better , Pryde ? " " Much , thank you , " says Pryde , and blushes darkly . " Did n't know you were ill , " says Hazlitt . " I 'm not ill . " " Change of life , " says Hazlitt . " Scotch ? " Probyn-Tweed nods absent-mindedly , and reaches out a square , pared , scoured hand for the glass . He is by no means a friendly man . One feels that too much competence has dehumanized him . His hand appears empty , like a cleared table , when it is not holding a scalpel or a thermometer ; between his thumb and forefinger the glass of whisky looks like anything but a pleasant drink . A cautious sip , a suspicious taste , an inquisitive sniff , a contemplative pause , and then , in a jerk , the whisky is drunk and Probyn-Tweed is sucking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gentlemen ? " he asks . " Yes , " says Mann , raising his glass . " And for what we are about to receive , may the Lord give us good reason to be truly thankful . " " Morbid , Mr. Mann ? " " Not in the slightest , " says Mann , with a laugh . " Let 's have one more for the ditch , " says Pryde , shaking himself . The doctor shakes his head . " Not for me . I 've got to go . " He moves away , mutters , " Do n't overdo it , " and strides out with a brusque grunt of farewell . Mann says : " Ah , our friend the Plumber regards a drink as alcohol , to be taken in doses in order to produce a relaxing effect . Not as an aid to social intercourse , not as an avenue of escape , but as a medicine pure and simple . He does n't see anything at all except in what he believes to be the light of cold reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish I could do that . / always see things . . " He stops . All the life seems to go out of him . But Mann goes on : " A man like the Plumber simply does n't know the meaning of things like love , or hate , or fear . All men , to him , are parcels of meat and guts . Himself included , oh , yes , himself included . " Mann picks up an olive , takes from his pocket and opens a small penknife , pensively cuts a neat slit in the olive , and removes the stone , which he holds up and thoughtfully regards . . .. he will see what plenty of us are made of quite soon now . Literally , what we arc made of . . . " He cuts a slice off the olive and says : " Zip ! One hair's-breadth stands between life and death , that is to say success or failure for Probyn-Tweed . . . " " Yes , " says Pryde , with something like a whimper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy enough for him to cover up a slip . What about us ? Our lives arc in his hands . " Hazlitt has turned away to buy drinks for three or four strangers to whose faces he happens to have taken a fancy . Pryde says : " Let 's go ; this place is stifling . " They walk to the door . " Mann ! " " Uh ? Yes ? " " Mann , " says Pryde , " listen . We 've been friends quite a time . You 're a clever fellow . You 've read all the books in the world . There 's a personal thing I want to tell you about , something terribly confidential , Mann , terribly important and confidential . You 're a good fellow and I trust you , and I 'd like to tell you . " But they are in the street now . The traffic is congested ; the whole town seethes with a hideous unrest . Refugees are coming in and soldiers are going out . Mann says : " Of course , Pryde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think I know what you want to say . " " You do n't ; you ca n't possibly . " " I think I do , old fellow . " Pryde 's face changes color twice in two seconds . " You ca n't possibly know  --  nobody on God 's earth knows . " Mann sighs , but the half-smile remains although his voice is sad as he says : " I think I have guessed . Let 's wait until we are a little more private . " Nothing more is said . ' W TALKING again beside Mann in the late evening after mess , Pryde holds himself tense , and has an air of anguish and preoccupation mixed with shame  --  he reminds Mann of a shy youth who suffers hideous discomforts because he can not bring himself to ask the way to the lavatory . " Well , old fellow ? " asks Mann . " Well what ? " " I thought you wanted to tell me some-thing ? " " I . . . it 's nothing . I 've changed my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you . " " As you please , " says Mann , in his gentle voice . Pryde says : " It 's all very well for you to ? " Then he stops , hesitates , and starts again : " Do you know what that confounded MO had the bloody impudence to insinuate yesterday ? " " No . What ? " " That I was malingering . " " Really ? " " You saw his attitude today ? " " Probyn-Twcecl 's always like that . " ' Is he ? I think not . I went to him as anybody might , with a bit of a sick stomach . And he as good as told me I was ? " " Oh , come , Pryde , come ! " " But why ? Why ? " asks Pryde , between his teeth . " Do I look as if I wanted to get out of anything ? Do I ? " " Do n't be an idiot , my dear fellow ! " " Answer my question , Mann . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverse . " " That 's not true , Mann  --  you do n't mean that . Everybody seems to think ? " " Pryde ! Better get hold of yourself . " Pryde grits his teeth and says : " Well , the actual fact of the matter is ? " " Um-hm ? " " My nerves have been a hit upset , that 's all . Nothing more than that . " " Why , naturally , Pryde , old fellow ! Whose nerves are n't ? " " Well , then . . " Pryde stops again , and this time he says nothing more until Mann speaks again . A bugle sounds . " Was that all you had to tell me ? " asks Mann . " What else should there be ? " " Nothing else at all . Why should there be anything else ? I do n't know , Pryde . You told me you wanted to tell me something ? " " Yes , I know I did . And you said you knew , or guessed , or something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " What I said . " " You could guess what I had to tell you ? " " Yes , I think so . " " Then that 's that ! " snaps Pryde . " You mean to say you can " But he can not go on : the words wo n't come out . Mann has placed a light hand on Pryde 's shoulder , and now he says , in a voice which has cooled and set : " Pryde . Go to bed and go to sleep . " " Sleep ! Ha ! " " Yes , sleep . You 'll sleep . Go to bed now , Pryde , and you 'll sleep . " " What a fool I was to start this talk ! " " No , you were n't , Pryde . Now do n't say any more . I understand what it 's all about . I 'll tell you one thing . " " What ? " With extreme deliberation Mann says : " It is not one quarter as bad as you think ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering hell . I know that you 're going to go through a season in hell . But I give you my word of honor , Pryde , my word of honor that it 'll come out well for you once and for all . My word of honor ! " As Mann 's voice has become clear and firm , Pryde 's voice has softened . He says : " I 'm sorry to have been so damned discourteous , Mann . I snapped at you like a dog . Do forgive me . I 'm sorry , and I beg your pardon . " " Bed now , " says Mann . " I 'll go now . And , Mann  --  thank you . " " Silly fellow , " says Mann . " God bless you . Good-night , old fellow . " " Good-night , Mann . . . . I say . " " Urn ? " " I hope you get out of this mess alive . " " Thanks , Pryde , thanks . I shall . So will you . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Pryde . " Good-night . " And he goes to his bed , preparing for another wretched night of taut wakefulness . Can Mann know ? he asks himself , as he undresses . Does my face tell everybody that I am a damned coward ? Do I look as I feel sick with fear ? He lays out cigarettes and matches . There can be no sleep for him now , no hope of sleep . He is certain that he must lie and listen to nothing , and torment himself with the conviction that when the moment comes for action he will be paralyzed  --  his heart will beat in his bellyand his throat will dose tight while his nerves sag loose ; although his reason will spit down at him in disgust his body will die one of the thousand deaths before the grave , and he will be shamed forever . All night long he will ask himself : Of what am I afraid ? Death ? . . No ! Pain ? . . . No ! Pryde dreads these shadowy soliloquies ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Of what am I afraid ? The answer is : Nothing . Simply that he is afraid : Fear is his Familiar  --  it is always with him , half a pace behind him , playing with him , clawing his hair on end . All his life , Pryde has been on the run , glancing back over his shoulder . And he knows that now Fear is running shoulder to shoulder with him  --  and that very soon Fear will glide ahead of him and at a certain moment turn and show him its blind , blank , stupefying face . . . . And then . . Yes : he is desperately afraid  --  of Fear . Pryde gets into bed . Mann was right : within a minute or two he is fast asleep , with his neglected light still burning . id ow much of a battle can a soldier witness ? If a man is swimming for his life , how much of the ocean does he see ? Half a dozen perilous yards in front of him , a few menacing feet to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while as for what lies behind him , he knows nothing and has no time to guess . He is straining every muscle and nerve in order to keep alive . If anger , or fear , or the excitement of combat have not crowded out all other emotions , he may occasionally feel a certain astonishment at not being dead . Mr. Mann has always believed that the peculiar dull silence of old , scarred warriors is not the silence of sick horror but the silence of vague emptiness the half-shamefaced silence of men who can not think of anything to say . A soldier can only speak of what he alone has done ; and this may be told in a few seconds , because there is not very much for one man to do . When the moment comes , the fierce moment of bloody contact , every man is alone in his own red mist with his own desperate enemy . The beautifully co-ordinated army breaks up , for a little while , into the atoms of which it is composed  --  into tiny , lonely life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even Mann stops to think that this wadi , this dried-up path of an evaporated river , is nothing but an almost invisible mark on a map enlarged to include the pimples and the blackheads between the shoulder-blades of the desert ? that this attack is only one jabbing rally in a mighty battle ; that the battle itself is nothing but one round in a fight to a finish ; that the entire campaign is but an incident in the African War ; that the African War in alI its bloody magnitude is merely a skirmish in one dusty corner of a battlefield as vast as the earth . He thinks of nothing but the space that separates him from the Enemy in the turbulent dust ahead . Pryde grits his teeth and hopes to God that they may charge soon and get it over . Between his ribs his heart is drumming like the fingers of an anxious and impatient man . From a great distance , half lost in the uproar , there comes a sound of shouting . And then the word comes . Pryde rises into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great sweeping gesture . The Royal Archers throw themselves down into the wadi and charge , yelling , into the open . A LAST comes the twilight hour of the stretcher-bearers , the blind man 's holiday that falls between the red dusk of the bayonets and the white night of the little knives . At this hour nobody can think of anything or desire anything but sleep . A battle is not bad and a victory is very good ; but men must rest before they can rejoice  --  they will talk about it tomorrow , after they have peeled some of the black velvet off their eyes . At present nothing matters but unbroken sleep . An untied bootlace is better than glory . If anybody prays now for Peace , what he really means is : Please God , take off my socks . A IONG the walking casualties there is a tall , pale man dressed in the ragged remains of an officer 's uniform . He isunwounded except for a long S-shaped gash on the left-hand side of his face . He stands erect , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest . There is an odd expression on his face . A casual observer would say that he was angry : his forehead and eyebrows are drawn down so that there is an indentation like a letter W over the bridge of his nose , and his lips are pressed away into a line . But , if one looks closely at him , it is easy to see that he is not angry  --  only bewildered . Somebody says to him : " Shook you up a bit , sir ? " The tall man shakes his head impatiently . " Just a minute , " he says . " Hold on just a minute . Now . . . what 's that again ? " " It shook you up a bit , did n't it , sir ? " " What do you mean , shook me up a bit ? " " No offense ? " " No , damn it all , of course there is n't . What do you mean ? Why should there be any offense ? I asked you a civil question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said no offense , sir . " " Was that what you said ? I thought . . . " People exchange glances . A company sergeant major who is holding something wet and red over the place where the top of his left ear used to be says : " Not badly hurt , I hope , sir ? " " No . . . I do n't think so . Why , what do you mean , badly hurt ? And who are you anyway ? " The Sergeant Major raises his eyebrows , winces , and says : " Cox , sir . Cox , Arthur George . " " How do you do ? I do n't think we 've met before . . . ? " Cox grins uneasily . His quick little eyes glance up and down . " Sorry , sir , " he says . " Sorry ? Sorry ? Who 's sorry ? What for ? What the devil 's the matter with you ? . .. And who are you anyway ? " " Cox , sir , Sergeant Major of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did I work for a company ? Were you a director ?

" asks the tall man . " Do I what ? " " Do you know who you are ? " The tall man shakes his head . Cox says : " You 're Lieutenant the Lord Hazlitt , sir . " " I am ? " " Yes , sir .

" M ANN has been stabbed in the abdomen , and is in atrocious pain . He has heard that men with belly wounds dig their own graves before they die , because they writhe so hard ; he understands now that this may be true . He clenches his teeth and shuts his eyes , swimming on waves of nausea , and feels that every vibration of the air must tear him asunder . Is he dying ? He is shivering with cold . Swallowing a groan , he tries to lie still . Stillness , stillness  --  in stillness lies the secret of survival and of healing .

Then he feels , rather than sees , a brightness , opens his eyes and groans . Probyn-Tweed , ash-gray with fatigue , is looking down at him . Mann whispers : " Is it bad ?

He is drugged with delight as with cocaine  --  he has sniffed ecstasy and floated up beyond himself . Pryde feels that he is born again , cleansed of fear . Looking at his dirty face in a steel shaving mirror of the kind that is supposed to serve as armor against shrapnel wounds , Pryde knows the joy of an impoverished collector who has crept into a lumber room to die and discovered an Old Master among the rubbish . At such moments as this a man forgives all his enemies  --  even himself . " Fear ? " says Pryde aloud , and laughs . He is happy ; he wants to be kind and helpful to all the world .

" " Good man ! Oh . . . I 'm quite sure there 'll be no delay . And I 'm quite sure that everything is going to be all right . " " Thank you , sir . " IN-IGHT comes . An enormous quiet has fallen upon the desert . Under the stars men labor at the broken shells of ruined tanks , while grain by grain the sand rolls down quietly obliterating their tracks , and a few last white ribbons of smoke creep out of the battered iron giants in the dust . Face O NE August afternoon in Kaifeng I arrived at the railroad station at ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chengchow , forty miles distant , only to find that the ticket window was closed . " Wai , open up , you ! Sell me a ticket to Chengchow . " The only response was the unmistakable sound of a lively gambling game in progress within . " Wai , " I shouted , and banged again , and waited . No answer . I shook the wicket . " Better get on the train . It leaves at once . No time to sell tickets . " This was shouted through the wooden barrier by one of the clerks , who was obviously engaged with business wholly unrelated to railroading . Fearing lest I really miss my train  --  which was standing in the station  --  I hurried out on the platform , climbed aboard , and found my way to a seat in a rather sparsely filled third-class car . A slight little man in a stiffly laundered white linen garment generously offered to share his seat .
