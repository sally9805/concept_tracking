Nothing is so dangerous as being too modern . One is apt to grow old-fashioned quite suddenly - Lady Markby in Oscar Wilde 's An Ideal Husband . <P> Oscar Wilde , who tried to set quite a few fashions himself , might have been amused to know that last week Moscow took the same disapproving view of him and his works as his most disapproving Victorian contemporaries ever did . For stooping to put on a brilliant performance of his entertaining An Ideal Husband , the famed Moscow Art Theater shivered under simultaneous critical broadsides from the 16-inch guns of Izvestia and Pravda . <P> The trouble lay in the comedy 's innocence of ideology . In Moscow manners are no substitute for Marxist morals , or elegance for Engelsian ethics . Izvestia , speaking in terms recognizable to Western criticism , denounced " the all-corrosive and therefore all-justifying irony of Wilde 's esthetic principle " as being " far from the true realistic satire " of Swift and Dickens . Izvestia dubbed it " the principle of decadence , " and flayed the performers for entering " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with reality . They seem to have forgotten whom they are portraying-who the play 's heroes are in sober social reality . " <P> Pravda spoke in its own esoteric tongue . From the turgid depths of Marxist dialectics it dredged up the basic criterion for Soviet art : " The significance of the ideological and creative evolution of the Moscow Art Theater . . . consists in its recognition of partisanship in art . " <P> The New York Times 's Brooks Atkinson , an old professional playgoer himself , blandly drew the moral : " The wayward leaders of the Moscow Art Theater at least have learned the importance of being earnest .
