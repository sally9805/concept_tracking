Last week the Mexican Consul General in Manhattan announced a deal whereby 1 ) millions of pesos of native capital went to work in Mexico , encouraged by the new friendly atmosphere of the Avila Camacho regime , 2 ) Mexico took a big step toward her own industrialization , 3 ) Japan lost another customer in the Western Hemisphere , 4 ) a Massachusetts textile firm sold a batch of idle machinery . <P> Entrepreneur of this quadruple play was an Italian count ( who likes to be called Mr. ) , debonair Giovanni Naselli . Born in Manhattan 45 years ago , and hence a U.S. citizen , the count is no Fascist although he spent about ten years making rayon and lire in the Rome branch of the huge Societ Generate Italiana della Viscosa , a world leader in cheap rayon manufacture . In 1933 he went to Mexico City , there started his own rayon twisting plant , Cia . Nacional de Artisela . S.A. , whose 25,000 spindles now twist 60% of Mexico 's rayon yarn and make it the world 's No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spindles in a plant of the Comptoir des Textiles Artificiels in France ) . <P> To Mexicans , rayon ( in bright colors ) is as well loved as tequila and la corrida de toros . But the yarn had to be imported - first from Italy , and , after the war began , from Japan . U.S. yarn costs twice as much as Japanese , but the Japanese yarn is coarse and inferior , and Naselli began looking for some rayon-making machinery of his own . He found it some 3,000 miles away in Easthampton , Mass . <P> There the Hampton Co. , cotton finishers , had set up a 1,500,000-lb. - per- year rayon plant as an experiment , discovered that American Viscose , Du Pont and Industrial Rayon were hard on newcomers , shut their plant in 1939 . The machinery has been for sale ever since . Naselli bought it with money raised in Mexico , last week had men dismantling it for removal to San Angel , suburb of Mexico City . By mid-1943 , says he , its production will be expanded to 6,000,000 lb. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Textile makers had tough sledding during the Crdenas regime , when the workers took over about one-third of Mexico 's rayon industry . The count eluded them by employing 16-to-18-year-old , soft-fingered ( best for rayon working ) girls and paying them six pesos a day ( 2 pesos is the minimum wage ) . Mexican working girls , even though unmarried , take advantage of their right to a 40-day maternity leave with pay each year , followed by two half-hour baby-feeding periods daily .
