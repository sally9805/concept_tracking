For years , no meeting of the American Medical Association has been complete without a rumor that contentious , energetic Dr. Morris Fishbein would be ousted as editor of A.M.A. 's Journal , which is the only official position he has ever held in U.S. medicine 's topmost organization . But through most of his 37 years with A.M.A. ( he will be 60 in July ) , Dr. Fishbein went serenely on as official spokesman for U.S. doctors . He was " Dr. A.M.A. " and the man to quote on anything medical . He was quoted so often that few of his bosses ever got much attention . The front man was the whole show . <P> Through the years some doctors grew envious of the publicity and money , that Dr. Fishbein got as traveler , radio speaker , newspaper columnist and author of 21 popular medical books that have sold 3,000,000 copies . Others resented the efficient battles he fought against anything that smacked of socialized medicine . <P> Last week at the annual meeting in Atlantic City , the A.M.A. hierarchy dumped Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies felt a little sorry for him . <P> No Controversy . Dr. Elmer L. Henderson , of Louisville , Ky. , chairman of the Board of Trustees , handed out the black spot toward the end of the dull opening session of the House of Delegates in the Hotel Traymore 's white and gold American room . Dr. Henderson , later named president-elect in a cut &; dried election , began his report on " the activities of the editor " with an admission that " the board ... is aware of the criticism of the editor . " Fishbein 's name was not mentioned until the next-to-last paragraph . Then there was a suave tribute to his " genius and devotion . " In the paragraphs between , Dr. Fishbein got his walking papers . <P> As soon as someone could be trained to take over the job , Morris Fishbein would be retired as editor of the Journal he had built into the largest medical periodical in the world . He was brusquely ordered to stop forthwith all speeches on controversial topics , to give no interviews except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for approval . Most delegates understood that Dr. Fishbein was being used as a lightning rod to divert criticism from A.M.A. while his bosses continued to fight socialized medicine tooth &; nail . <P> No Change . Nobody was fooled-least of all the liberals who lean toward just a little harmless bit of " socialization " in medicine-into thinking that Fishbein 's firing meant a change in fundamental A.M.A. attitude . The tipoff came three days later , when the delegates passed the buck on approval of the controversial prepaid medical plans run by laymen back to the local societies-in the past , the bitterest enemies of prepaid plans . The House , without committing itself , passed along a set of principles to " guide " the local societies in this old fight .
