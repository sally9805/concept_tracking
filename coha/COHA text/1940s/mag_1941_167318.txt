The noise proved to be a house mouse ( Mus musculus ) calmly gnawing the sole of a newspaper reporter 's shoe . Newshawk William Alexander , of the Long Island Daily Press , had been so busy he had n't noticed . Judge Golden had the mouse caught and executed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Times soberly regarded Newshawk Alexander , praised his powers of concentration , added : " He approaches his duties with single-mindedness . He looks up , not down . It is possible to foresee a bright future for him if mice do n't consume him first . "
