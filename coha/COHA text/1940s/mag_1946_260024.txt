There has not been a first-rate and popular opera written since Richard Strauss 's Der Rosenkavalier in 1911. * There have even been few good tries ( Deems Taylor 's Peter Ibbetson , two by Gian-Carlo Menotti ) . Last week U.S. critics got a first look and listen to a year-old English opera , Peter Grimes . They almost unanimously hailed frail , 32-year-old Benjamin Britten as the most promising operatic composer of the day . <P> Britten 's Peter Grimes , first produced in London in June 1945 , had already been sung in Swedish in Stockholm , in Flemish in Antwerp , in German in Basel and Zurich . Last week at Serge Koussevitzky 's summer music colony at Tanglewood in the Berkshires , U.S. audiences heard three performances in English . <P> " A Lively Performance . " Dr. Koussevitzky had commissioned Peter Grimes in memory of his late wife , and he proudly proclaimed it the greatest opera since Carmen . He did not conduct its U.S. premire , but left it to his prize protg , Manhattan 's Leonard Bernstein . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of violent and raw emotion , and agreed that in plot , at least , Peter Grimes had much in common with Bizet 's lurid tale of smuggling and murder . <P> From a poem . by the Rev. George Crabbe , a 19th-Century English parson-poet , Librettist Montagu Slater had fashioned a psychopathic case history of a sadistic Suffolk fisherman . The first scene is an inquest into the murder of Peter Grimes 's boy apprentice . Peter Grimes is exonerated , but the townspeople-fishermen , harlots and scowling drunks-still suspect him and set out to persecute him . Peter takes another apprentice to work for him , and the second boy dies in an accident . The villagers hold Peter responsible and drive him out to sea to drown himself . The score is Mozartian in its classical simplicity , Wagnerian in the way it jumps from recitative to aria without stopping the action of the story . The scenes are bound together by biting symphonic interludes . <P> Two student casts alternated on different evenings in singing Peter Grimes .

The most unimpressed member of the Tanglewood audience was Composer Britten himself . Said he stiffly : " There 's no use pretending it was professional . ... It was a very lively student performance . " <P> Song for God . When he was eight years old Benjamin Britten revealed his unorthodox musical behavior by writing an angry song to be sung by God . He wrote a U.S. operetta named Paul Bunyan which got no place . At Tanglewood he glumly watched rehearsals wearing a pearl-grey jacket , a yellow tie and strap sandals .
