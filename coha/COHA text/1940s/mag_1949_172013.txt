Hollywood , brooding about its newfangled competitor , television , likes to think of it as a cloud that is still no bigger than a man 's hand . Last week the TV cloud was casting a sizable shadow on one of the U.S. screen 's hardiest perennials : the newsreel . <P> In New Jersey , the 40-theater Walter Reade chain had dropped newsreels experimentally in half a dozen houses without a single complaint from a customer ; it decided to ease them , out gradually in other theaters . In Manhattan , the RKO chain admitted that it would try the same experiment in a handful of its 108 double-feature houses . <P> The painful fact was that 4,000,000 feet of film still streaming weekly out of five major newsreel companies ( Fox-Movietone , Paramount , Warner Pathe , Universal , M-G-M News-of-the-Day ) was being staled in television areas by TV 's faster , if still less complete , news coverage in pictures . Peacetime had put a big crimp in the popularity won by the war 's combat films . But when such ordinarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game failed to draw heavily , the realists knew the reason : TV . <P> Farsighted newsreelers think that one hope for their survival in theaters lies along a trail blazed by Paramount , toward an interpretive digest of the news in a documentary style popularized by the MARCH OF TIME . In the long run , they hope to compete in spot news through big-screen theater television . Theater TV may also become a major movie sideline . Last week 20th Century-Fox was reported nurturing a plan to set up big TV screens in 15 or 20 of its West Coast theaters by year 's end . Through closed circuits , Fox would feed topnotch " live " shows to thea ter screens and outbid TV networks and advertisers for high-priced talent . <P> In the East , cautious exhibitors waited to be convinced . It would be expensive to install the big TV equipment . ( Current estimate : $25,000 per theater . ) An even bigger headache : supplying the money and imagination for the kind of TV shows that will persuade customers to leave their living-room sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
