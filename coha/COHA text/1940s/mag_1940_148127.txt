Last week Congressman Melvin J. Maas , of St. Paul , Minn. , proposed that the U. S. Navy build 80,000-ton battleships - nearly twice the size of two mighty monsters now on the way . Horrified admirals paid attention to Mr. Maas only because : 1 ) he is the ranking Republican on the House Naval Affairs Committee ; and 2 ) his remarks were symptomatic of a tendency on the part of Navy-minded Congressmen to dream for themselves . <P> Dreamy members of the House subcommittee which handles Naval appropriations asked the Navy Department to draw up estimates for 65,000-ton leviathans . Even these would be 30,000 tons bigger than the biggest now in the U. S. fleet , 23,900 tons bigger than Great Britain 's Hood ( biggest afloat ) , and would be too bulky to get through the Panama Canal . Said Sub-Committeeman Charles Albert Plumley of Northfield , Vt. , thumbing his Yankee nose at the British : " I 'm sick and tired of just match , match . This matching game is absurd . I want a winning team . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
