Do n't go to Sinkiang . It 's a very hard trip-even dangerous . And when you come back , no one will believe what you find there . <P> Despite this friendly admonition from K. P. Chen , Shanghai banker and nonpartisan State Councillor , and similar advice from other well-informed Chinese , Time Inc. ' s Nanking correspondent , Frederick Gruin , went ( by air , truck and afoot ) to China 's huge , little-known , mineral-and-oil-rich Sin kiang province on the borders of Outer Mongolia and , with luck , came back with his story . Those of you who read TIME 'S account of it in the October 6 issue know that the story turned out to be another important piece in the pattern of Soviet encirclement of China . As for the trip itself , here are some excerpts from Gruin 's account : <P> " There are many aspects of tracking down the news , and the Sinkiang story - geographically , at any rate - was one of the tougher ones . It was as if our Rome correspondent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biking distance of Rome but 2,000 miles away , and , after getting there , found that he not only had to wrestle with a language ( Uighur ) in which even the U.S. State Department has no expert but also had to gather correct information about an overall situation with which neither he nor almost anyone else was familiar . " <P> To try to overcome the language barrier , Gruin took Colin-Ho , his interpreter , along . They got a lift in a Chinese Army C-47 , of which Gruin says " The pilot was a cocky , young , U.S.-trained Chinese who had never flown this remote , desolate route , tricky with fierce dust storms , violent thermal drafts rising from the upland deserts , snow-toothed mountains that bite more than 20,000 feet into the sky . He got us through with nothing worse than airsickness to Tihua , dusty , dirty , crossroads capital of Sinkiang , where the racial blood of all Central Asia mingles in the faces on the street . We planned to fly back with our pilot but , luckily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colin-Ho set about interviewing everybody who could help unravel the Sinkiang story . Most of their informants were as effusively evasive as the stocky Russian manager of Tihua 's Sino-Soviet airport who said he wanted no pictures taken because " the airport is in bad repair and it would give a bad impression if printed in the magazine . " After considerable argument Gruin was allowed to take two shots , carefully outlined before snapping . Then , for a firsthand view of the area where Chinese and Mongolian troops had been having a border fracas , they trucked across the gravel wasteland north of Tihua to Peitashan , a mountain oasis . Of this journey , Gruin wrote : <P> " The desert is mirage-haunted and the track through it is marked by carcasses and bleached bones of camels slaughtered by Kazak wanderers for the water in their stomachs . Tough Moslem soldiers with us shot down desert antelope and huang yang , or yellow sheep . One marksman quickly slashed his quarry 's jugular and guzzled the hot blood in the belief that this conveyed to him huang yang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more prosaically with Sinkiang 's wonderfully succulent melons , bought at oasis towns along the way .
