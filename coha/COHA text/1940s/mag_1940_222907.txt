In the town of Beeston , in central England , lived Dr. Leonard Phipps Lockhart , a nervous , high-strung man of 41 , with his devoted wife , Mary . As medical chief of Boots Pure Drug Co. ( biggest British drug chain ) , he supervised the health and mental-hygiene activities of 22,000 employes . Three years ago , he got in the news by addressing a meeting of topflight British scientists on " neuroses and unbalanced lives . " He knew what he was talking about . <P> In 1918 , Leonard Lockhart had been a soldier on the Western Front . One summer 's day , after he saw every comrade in his platoon wiped out , he collapsed with " shell shock . " Unlike most victims , he pulled himself together and soon returned to the trenches . But several times after the war , when faced by small crises , he completely lost his memory for a few hours . <P> On Sept. 1 , when Hitler marched into Poland , Leonard Lockhart stumbled home , huddled by the gas fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , over " boys on barbwire having their guts shot out . " Then , half-drowned with reminiscent terror , he went to bed . <P> Next thing he knew , he woke in a strange hospital room , dimly lit by a blacked-out bed lamp . He shouted for his wife . A doctor came to his side . " Your wife , " said he , ' " is dead . " Horrified , Dr. Lockhart broke into convulsive sobs . At first he could remember nothing of the previous evening , but later , he dimly recalled his wife 's body , " very cold and limp " in his arms . <P> Early on the morning of Sept. 2 , Dr. Lockhart 's manservant had gone to the door , had found a sign reading : " Keep out ; gas ( study ) . Fetch police . " In the study , near the open gas jet of the fireplace , lay Mrs. Lockhart 's dead body . Close by lay Dr. Lockhart , unconscious and half-asphyxiated . He was charged with murder . <P> Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lockhart . Whether the Lockharts had made a suicide pact , or whether the doctor had first killed his wife , the prosecution could not prove . According to English law , he was a murderer in either case . But what the jury wanted to learn was whether Dr. Lockhart was insane or not . He could not remember the event , but he had written a coherent note of warning , which seemed to indicate that he knew what he was doing . <P> Called to the witness stand were such prominent friends of Dr. Lockhart as Professor Millais Culpin of the University of London , Psychiatrist John Rawlings Rees of London 's Tavistock Clinic , Lord Dawson of Penn ( King George V 's physician ) . All agreed that Dr. Lockhart was suffering from a " fugue " or flight from reality , brought on by intense fear of a new war . His ordinary stream of consciousness was " suspended , " his higher and lower brain levels " dissociated . " Hence he had no understanding of the " nature and quality of his act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed , he completely forgot what he had done . Most likely , he would get such " storms " again .
