Man of the Year <P> Sirs : <P> Are nominations for Man of the Year in order ? If so , I hope I am the first , because I can save you a lot of head-scratching and elbow-bending by giving you your man right off . He is , naturally , General Douglas MacArthur , the man who won the war against Japan . <P> The General 's qualifications are too obvious to mention . It is common knowledge that he conducted one of the great strategic military campaigns of all time . He outgeneraled and outfought the minor-league Japs like the major leaguer he is . And now , his masterly administration of beaten Japan should be enough to convince all doubters that he is a major statesman , too . <P> What else can you do but choose him , TIME , if you propose to be consistent with history ? <P> <P> JOHN McGUIGAN <P> Minneapolis <P> Nominations are now open. - ED . <P> <P> Mrs. Richardson &; Mr. Crump <P> Sirs : <P> I wish to thank TIME Sept. 24 for taking an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political machine . <P> We can not claim to be a government by the people when in some states only those who can spare the $2 for poll tax are allowed a voice in their government . Mr. Crump takes advantage of the poll tax to further his political status . . . . <P> It is the duty of every American to eliminate all political machines , large or small , so that the Constitution of the United States of America may live on as an inspiration to the world at large . We can not hope to lead the world as a symbol of freedom and humanitarianism when we allow dozens of would-be Hitlers to thrive in our own country . . . . <P> MRS . LEE RICHARDSON Memphis <P> Too Much Protocol <P> Sirs : <P> The daily press reports that Colonel James H. Douglas Jr. , who had been " under consideration " for appointment as U.S. member of the Allied Commission in Italy , is not taking the job . TIME July 9 reported that he had accepted it . Did TIME err ? <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials chose Colonel Douglas for the post , got his acceptance and the tentative agreement of British officials . Protocol demanded so long a delay in announcing the appointment that Colonel Douglas withdrew his name . Rear Admiral Ellery Stone is still the U.S. Commissioner. - ED . <P> <P> Dreadful Distortion <P> Sirs : <P> Here is a photograph of the Selma Burke plaque of President Roosevelt . . . . Comparing it with the photograph published in TIME Sept. 17 , you can see how dreadfully the latter distorts the sculptured head , elongating it from tip of chin to tip of crown , what would amount , I think , to at least two inches . . . . I will say , however , that the plaque was extremely hard to photograph , especially with flash , as the light would bounce off the bronze into the lens of the camera . That is undoubtedly the reason the A.P . photographer took the picture from such an extreme offside angle , thereby distorting the sculptured head . <P> On account of this distortion I am not surprised at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did not have an opportunity to see the actual plaque , which only slightly idealizes Roosevelt . <P> SARAH NEWMEYER Publicity Director The Museum of Modern Art New York City
