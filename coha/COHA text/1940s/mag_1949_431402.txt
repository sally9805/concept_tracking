Like any other New York matron , I have my obstetrician and/or gynecologist , my pediatrician , my nose-and-throat man , and my surgeon . At times , each of these has consulted another expert on some aspect of my own or my family 's health . But despite this sizable medical staff , when I decided to take the medical profession 's well-publicized advice and have a general checkup , I had no one to turn to . My gynecologist refused to recognize me above the waist . My nose-and-throat man was totally oblivious of me from the neck down . I computed the cost of being examined in sections and said to myself , " What I need is an old family doctor . " A wave of nostalgia swept over me at the very thought of such a man . I was a child with tonsillitis again , and Doctor Smith 's fingers were on my pulse , bringing comfort through layers of pain . I smelled the peppermints he always brought when we were sick , heard again his perennial joke : " Guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How much we all were missing ! I was determined to find a doctor in New York to fill Doctor Smith 's role . While my check-up would be his  | first task , I saw myself gradually putting the whole family in his hands , and sloughing off , one by one , the army of impersonal medical pieceworkers we employed . Specialization , I soon discovered , has gone to such lengths in big cities that it is not easy to uncover a general practitioner . But after some sleuthing , I got my man . Hisname was Doctor Friend . All the people who recommended him called him Tom , which gave me the comfortable feeling that he was the simple , friendly sort of family doctor I had known as a child . In fact , by the time I called for an appointment , I was so carried away with recollections that I halfexpected to hear old Doctor Smith answer the phone . The crisp voice of a nurse brought me back to earth . After all , a busy New York doctor ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . I hoped I could speak to Doctor Friend about my routine checkup , but the nurse was well trained . " We make all Dr. Friend 's appointments , " she said coldly . " Name , please . " I made the appointment and hung up . IN the next mail , a questionnaire , roughly resembling an application for a civil-service examination , arrived from the doctor 's office . Curious about what was in store for me , I began to fill it in , searching my memory for past aches , pains , medical mishaps , and accidents that might be significant . The only one I could recall was a single nosebleed at twelve , the result of my last fist fight with a boy . On the sixth page of the questionnaire , the going got rough . I had finished reporting whether I had tantrums , nightmares , pains in my stomach ; whether I liked my father better than my mother , when I was stopped by : " Did you ever think of suicide ? " My first inclination was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as frivolous . Then I remembered the time my mother refused me silk stockings when I was ten , and how I pictured myself drowned in a swamp in the woods , with bloodhounds searching and Mother weeping . Certainly , Doctor Friend could n't mean that sort of thing . I left blank the space for my answer . Next came : " Do you get along with your family ( a ) sometimes , ( b ) rarely , ( c ) not at all ? , " followed by : " If you could marry again , would you choose the same man ? Do you consider yourself as happy as most people , ( a ) more , ( b ) less ? Do people act as if they liked you ? " Each spanking of my helpless youngsters , each cross word to my loving spouse , each spat with tired bus drivers rose to haunt me . The answer to the suicide question was clear now . I put it down . " Yes . " I had started out for my general checkup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was alive with aches and sore spots the morning I arrived at Doctor Friend 's fashionable Park Avenue address . The exterior of the building looked something like the gatehouse of an English estate ; but . this rural atmosphere was not carried out within . The place , internally , was hygienically modern ?  | chairs of plywood bent to fit the average American measurements ; hidden lighting simulating daylight ; no moldings to catch dust or germs . The floors were cork . The ceilings were soundproofed . So were the nurses , who kept coming and going like models at a fashion show . None of them spoke . One waved me to a chair . Another pointed out a resplendent collection of magazines on a table shaped like a vermiform appendix . I buried myself in Harper 's Bazaar and had almost completed a mythical spring wardrobe from its pages when another nurse extracted some blood from my middle finger . Re- j covering from this affront , I attacked the problem of a new hat . I was on the verge of choosing between a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the left brow when another tapped me on the shoulder . At the same moment , a voice blared from a public I address system : " Mrs. W. for oral . Mrs. W. for oral . " Too stunned to ask what this meant , I followed a starched figure through a labyrinthine tangle of corridors to another waiting room so like the one I had left that I thought we had made a complete circle . Even the same issue of the Bazaar lay on the same kind of table . Again , I immersed myself in fashion , determined to speculate no further . As a matter of fact , there was n't much time to worry . Soon another nurse wafted me to the threshold of a tiny office , where a presentable young man greeted me by name . I had really begun to wonder whether I would ever get high enough in the nursing hierarchy to reach the doctor , and my relief must have been a little exaggerated . " Good morning , Doctor Friend , " I said with a smile and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man drew back . " I am Doctor Folwell , " he said . My loss of equilibrium at this news must have been apparent , because Doctor Folwell , in what passed for a friendly gesture , patted my knee . " I am Doctor Friend 's assistant . We 'll just go over you , and then Doctor Friend will take a look . " I was about to protest that it would be Doctor Friend or no one when he whisked out the report I had filled in at home . Fixing me with a look of practised interest , he asked what my chief trouble was . PATIENTLY , I repeated , " Just a routine checkup . " Then I mentioned my hope that Doctor Friend would take on my husband and children , too . Doctor Folwell looked at me just long enough to let me see his nostrils quivering with distaste . " We never touch children , " he breathed . There was no time for me to explain that I was in the wrong pew . He was looking at his watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limit for personal discussion . He had the kind of pencil that writes in three colors , and he went through my report as if it were a bank run ? checking here , underlining there . No sound broke the silence save the click of the pencil as he shifted from red to blue to green . Another glance at the watch . " That 's fine , " the doctor said . He was apparently referring to the fact that he had finished the interview several seconds under schedule . He stood up . I stood up . He smiled . I waited . A starched figure appeared . " This way  | Mrs. W. , " she said , giving off warmth as energetically as the North Pole . Another walk . She deposited me in a small room with the sterile quality of a box of gauze . After telling me to strip to my slip , she went out . The door clicked behind her . I did n't try the handle for fear it was locked . Taking a cue from Doctor Folwell , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag went on the sterilizer , my stockings on the examining-table stirrups . By the time I had popped on the table , shrouded in a sheet , exactly thirty seconds had passed . Alone in my little room , spread on the table like a cold meal on a cafeteria tray , time lost its meaning . The hard metal of the table against the back of my head and the dazzling overhead light in my eyes put me in a state of complete suspension . Gradually I realized that I ached from head to toe . I was cold . My ears began to ring . I recalled stories I had heard about men who had retained their sanity through years of solitary confinement by producing great novels , great symphonies , or writing the Old Testament backward on the head of a pin . But I could n't even pass the time by writing my menus for the week , a thing I 'd always wanted to do . I was without pen or paper . What would my husband and family do when I failed to appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? But even these worries could not hold my attention . My mind drifted . The next thing I remember was writing President Truman on behalf of a Bill making it obligatory for " family doctors " to supply ceiling movies in all examining rooms . I jumped . Ah . It was n't my back breaking . It was the door opening at last . It was Folwell , the assistant family doctor . I was saved . HE proceeded to punch and tickle me until I was quite wide awake . Pausing momentarily , he referred again to my card and said , " Let me see , you came because you have severe nosebleeds . " I was too tired to explain that I had had only one nosebleed in my life and reiterate that I was there merely for a checkup . I remained passive while he stuck wires up my nose and pulled them out my ears . Finally he remarked that my nosebleeds were the result of nervous tension . " We live under great strain , you know , " he observed . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cursory glance at my toenails , which I had always admired . He then brushed off his hands as if he had been in contact with a leper , and , departing , said , " I just want Doctor Friend to see your nose . " For one moment on that cold metal table I balanced the desire to meet the doctor my friends called Tom against my dread . of spending another anxious hour laid out on the mortuary slab . Then I made my decision . I sprang up , dressed , and left the table , the sheet , and the room behind me . Still blinded by my sojourn under the overhead light , I groped my way back over the course by which I thought I had arrived and finally found my coat and hat , which seemed to be waiting with a look of sheer longing . My fears of being caught were groundless . The starched figures barely raised their eyes as I passed . When I was out in the world again , daylight never had seemed so dear . I glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half hours had elapsed . If I ran , I could just get my child at school . Surprisingly enough , I did meet Doctor Friend finally , though indirectly . Two weeks later I received the following letter : " DEAR MRS . W. : " It was a pleasure to take care of you and find you in such good health . I enclose a complete report on our findings . You will note that the posterior tibial pulsations of the legs were absent bilaterally , but we do n't attach any particular significance to this . Your nosebleeds , as we explained , are caused by nervous tension . There is no special recommendation . " I want you to feel that you can call on me at any time . It was a pleasure to take care of you . " Sincerely yours , THOMAS BAILEY FRIEND , M.D. " We have a family doctor now . He lives in a small town in Vermont where we go summers and he is ours for the price of a long-distance call . If anything serious happened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could ever reach the lowest of Doctor Friend 's disciples .  |
