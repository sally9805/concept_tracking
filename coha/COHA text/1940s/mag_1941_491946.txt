R EWI ALLEY is unique because he nhas achieved greatness in a country where few foreigners ever managed to create an authentic ripple . He means to China today at least as much as Colonel Lawrence meant to the Arabs , and perhaps more . Where Lawrence brought to Arabia the destructive technique of guerrilla warfare , Alley is teaching China the constructive organization of guerrilla industry . Probably few Chinese will fully appreciate the Alley ripple for another decade  --  which is one secret of his success . He knows how to lead men by showing them how to lead themselves . That is really about all his famous vest-pocket industries are doing for the thousands of men and women whom they have transformed from destitute refugees into producers and useful citizens . In July , 1938 , when the Chinese government took this New Zealand blitz-builder away from the Shanghai Settlement Council to become chief adviser of Chinese Industrial Co-operatives , that organization was only a name . It did not own a lathe , or even a chisel . More than 90 per cent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alley picked up the pieces and improvised a new conception of industry  --  native products to fill Free China 's empty markets . Out of Chaos T ODAY Alley 's Indusco -- the decentralized Industrial Cooperatives  --  are growing so fast that most data is stale before it is printed . Early in November there were more than 2400 factories spread across sixteen provinces , or an area nearly as large as all Europe . An Indusco line extended from guerrilla territory behind enemy positions into China 's deep rear , and from the Mongolian plateau to the highlands of Yilnnan . An army of more than 250,000 was directly dependent on Indusco , and work was being created for thousands more . Complete blockade  --  even before the Burma Road was reopened  --  was no longer the nightmare it had been in 1938 . Rewi Alley is something new in China 's relations with the foreign devil . A " barbarian " who knows the Celestial language better than most Chinese . An adviser who draws his dividends from the thrill of rehabilitating human life . A missionary whose churches are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headquarters are where the day 's end finds him  --  a peasant 's hut , a muleteer 's inn , and sometimes simply the green bank of a stream . But this World War hero sees himself primarily as part of a great human adventure . " To create production and livelihood where there were none before , to build growing things out of chaos  --  this is the greatest and most satisfying adventure of our time ? " Who is this Marco Polo in reverse , who does not carry off the secrets of Cathay but helps the oldest society on earth to discover new powers ? I never imagined that I would someday write such paragraphs about Rewi Alley when I first met him far up in Inner Mongolia in the arid June of 1929 , and yet I knew that he was something rather unusual . We were the only foreigners on a " famine special " going into the country west of Kalgan , where 3,000,000 people eventually starved to death . Except for the service car in which I rode with a Chinese politician , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freight . Out of the latter I was astonished to see a European crawl for a breath of air at one station . I went up and introduced myself . He was a strange figure in that dark , sickly crowd , his sunburned face covered with dust beneath a reddish bush of upstanding hair . He was of only medium height , but under his khaki shorts I saw a pair of tremendous rugged legs . When he stood with those giant 's legs spread apart , he seemed somehow rooted to earth . But it was the man 's head that struck me . It had a profile like something carved from Stone Mountain . Later it made the same impression on the British sculptor , Francis Shurrock , who did a bronze bust of Alley for the Royal Academy of London . He called it Profile of Tomorrow . I was only a horrified observer of the famine , but this man had chosen the spot for his holiday . He worked all summer among the typhus-infested people , distributing relief grain , helping build irrigation ditches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " / asked myself . He was obviously no evangelist . I did not quite get this one-man Salvation Army . It was the first time I had ever seen men die of hunger . I soon had enough , and returned , puzzled . to Peiping , where I wrote a dispatch for my paper , describing the tragedy . I remember that a little New York boy read the story and sent me a dollar bill clear from America , to give to the starving boys and girls in Suiyuan . For all I know , that is the only good my effort did . But Alley came out with more . The next time I saw him he was the foster father of an orphan lad whose parents had perished in the famine . Not long afterward he was loaned by the Shanghai Municipal Council to Sir John Hope Simpson , to help rebuild the Yangtze dikes after the great flood , in ' 31 . Again I wrote some stories and again Alley came out with a famine orphan  --  and a brother for his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put them both in good schools in Shanghai . " It 's getting to be a habit , " remarked his British friends in Council circles , where the Family Alley was considered quite " extr'ordin'ry . " One told me it all came about because of a " busted romance . " " Alley could n't get the girl , so he decided to have a family anyway . " A Lesson Learned at Ypres DLIT in a few yearn the white sahibs who would LI not sit down with a coolie at their tables , not to mention adopting one , had to admit that Alley was a successful parent . The two peasant lads led their classmates in study and sport . Finally , at St. John 's University , Alan was elected president of his class . I knew Alley some time before I realized that it was no amatory rebound , but a congenital horror of waste , that made him unable to resist a chance to save a human life . One day he told me of an experience which , perhaps , explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1917 , " he said , " I marched out of Ypres one night beside another New Zealand boy of eighteen  --  a tough kid named Jeff . He had led a horrible life . His mother was a character in a hotel back home . We all had a low opinion of him . I had got dysentery , and so had he , and on the way to the front lines we fell behind the others . Suddenly we came upon a very bad corner . Huge shells threw up geysers of mud as they struck very near us . We began to run and stumbled over one of the men we were to relieve . He was lying face down in the mud , unconscious . I started to go around him . " ' Wait ! ' Jeff yelled at me . ' Is he dead ? ' " ' Sure , ' I muttered , anxious to get on . But the tough boy stopped me and then stood examining the wounded man . ' No , ' he finally said , ' he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in that sea of mud under bursts of shellfire he gave me a lecture , the most humiliating I ever got . " ' You may think human life is of no value when you see it thrown away as it is here , ' he said , ' but that is not so . This man 's life was worth as much to him a few minutes ago as ours is worth to us now . Life is precious to everybody . ' He went on , and ended up , ' Give me a hand ; let 's pull this fellow out . ' " We did pull him out . He was still breathing and we saved his life . I never forgot this lesson , given to me by a man I had imagined my inferior . " Perhaps it is only after such an experience , in which one 's own ego appears in its true microscopic relation to the vast unity of life , that one can begin to see other people and their misery as an organic part of one 's own daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Alley . I do n't mean that he became in any sense a soulsaver  --  nobody is more impatient with the religious zealot . Yet you can not be around this man long without absorbing some of the tremendous energy which springs from his profound enthusiasm for human life . That , it seems to me , explains his amazing talent for evoking the priceless response of creative personality from raw material so crude that most of us would discard it as useless . With his penetrating long-view eyes , as somebody called them , his fiery hair and his hawklike English nose , Alley is the perfect image of the kind of foreign devil to frighten the wits out of Chinese children . Yet he is probably the hero of more of them today than any foreigner . Boy Scouts , factory apprentices , " little devils " in the army , Ai Li has helped hundreds . There is one example , the famine victim he took from one of those " orphan homes " in Shanghai which are in reality slave-labor or " white-slave " rackets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there Ah Hsiang went ahead by himself . Through diligent night study he learned English and got some technical training . Today he is an able organizer in the Indusco system and carries large responsibilities . Making Men Out of Street Urchins " THE trouble with the rulers of this country , " 1 Alley keeps repeating , " is that they do n't know the capacities of their own people . You can take any boy from the streets of China and make a good man of him . All he needs is a break . " Alley has a hundred case histories to prove his point . His own sons are , of course , Exhibit A. They became for him an Open Sesame to the heart of China . He had adopted them and they were determined that China should adopt him . They went on long tramps together across the fields and mountains . He learned to read and write the language with them . Thus he was initiated into the intimacies of Chinese life , and learned the strength and weakness of Chinese character . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of aches and pains and hopes fundamentally not very different from those of the white man . Unknowingly , he prepared himself for a leading role which an accident of war was to assign to him . It was a long time before I learned much about Alley 's early life . He is a kind of self-generating dynamo energizing other people to action , drawing from his steady flow of power . It was characteristic that I should know him for a decade before learned  --  from somebody else  --  that he was one of his country 's outstanding heroes , decorated by the former Prince of Wales for distinguished bravery in action . A bachelor , now forty-two , Alley is descended from a line of English and Irish trail breakers who helped settle . the United States as well as New Zealand . Two of his great-uncles volunteered with the Northern armies in the American Civil War and one was among the founders of Lincoln , Nebraska . His mother is the only survivor of the group who won suffrage for New Zealand women . Rewi 's own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fostered much of the progressive legislation of New Zealand . He spent the last twenty years of his life working for rural co-operatives and the factory farm in agriculture . He preached a future society that would reconcile the factory with man 's necessary contact with the soil . A combination of agriculture and industry would ultimately restore a balance , he thought , between the city and the farm . The elder Alley turned his own lands over to his sons and other youths and made them spend their holidays learning to work together . He taught them to experiment with different methods of dividing labor . The result was that they all learned to co-ordinate mental activity with physical performance  --  perhaps the secret of initiative and self-reliance . He taught his sons to admire courage and genius in any race . Thus he named the second of his seven children after the Maori chieftain , Rewi Te Manipoto , who defeated the redcoats with guerrilla tactics similar to those used by the American revolutionaries ? and by the Chinese today . Once , when Te Manipoto apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconditional surrender . The old guerrilla , who regarded the British as thieves and tyrants , replied in one simple but now glorious sentence : " We will fight on forever and ever ! " New Zealanders were proud to make an honorable peace with such a foe . " We will fight on forever and ever " is perhaps the slogan which best epitomizes Alley 's own fighting industries in China today . Waste in War , Waste in Peace The harsh New Zealand frontier built up in Te Manipoto 's namesake a physical strength to match that spirit . " A wild hard country , " Rewi told me , " with sweeping cold winds . We kids used to spend days living like Indians , trapping and hunting , or catching trout and cooking them on hot stones . I never wore a pair of shoes and socks till I was sent to a new school in the city - and how I hated them ! " I suppose I inherit my desire to fix things from my mother . She is now seventy-five , but still climbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same at ninety-four . Even today my mother can not stand to see anything in disrepair . The carburetor , the cream separator , thesewing machine or the motor that pumps the water ? she can put any of them right , and cook a meal for fifteen people on the side . She hates waste of any kind and probably I get that from her too . " From such a home Alley enlisted with his elder brother , who was later killed in France . He came out of the first World War still convalescent from severe wounds and gas , " glad to return to growing flowers , " as he puts it . It had seemed to him a grand adventure , but he was now disillusioned . Years later he was to discover true adventure at last ? in building , not destroying . With an old friend who had been an air pilot in Egypt , he next took up a 2000-acre section in heavy forest , which they cleared for sheep ranching . " On borrowed money we bought our crossbred sheep , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped out of the wool market . Our land and our fine sheep became worthless . Wool would not pay for the cost of cartage to town . In the end we tossed hundreds of pounds of wool into the river  --  while millions of men were in rags elsewhere ! The war was an utter and senseless waste of men and the fruits of their toil . Here was the same thing in peace . Why ? " Broke and bewildered , Alley gave his half interest in the ranch to his partner and set out for the city . Eventually , some former war comrades offered him a job as factory inspector for the Municipal Council of Shanghai . Here again he was to be confronted with a familiar phenomenon  --  the crime of waste . Alley found Shanghai the paradise of the world 's most unconscionable brokers in human life . Here unscrupulous little gangsters with a few machines and the money to run them made as much as 150 per cent in annual profits , imposing their own hours and wage scales on the luckless boys and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huddled in the dark tenements and rickety shops to produce goods cheap enough to undersell Japan . Tens of thousands of underfed children from nine to fifteen rarely drew a breath of unpolluted air in this industrial ulcer . Alley saw hundreds of children suffering from beriberi and pellagra , and from chemical poisoning . " Tragedy , day after day , " he wrote to me once , " and most of it easily avoidable . Rubber planta blown up , and girls ' corpses by the score . Panic in a cotton mill , all doors barred and many crushed to death . Rows of young girls in silk filatures standing twelve to fourteen hours a day over basins of boiling water , their fingers red and swollen , the overseer behind them with a length of wire , the kids sometimes crying as they worked . All for twenty cents Mex a day . It would be better to have no industry than to compete in this way  --  bringing children into the cities , starving them , working them longer hours than any horse could stand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Shanghai before Alley took command as chief inspector seven years ago . Some of his predecessors had retired with neat fortunes . Alley made factory reform a serious business . He traveled to London . to Berlin , to Paris and New York , to study the industrial systems in the most advanced countries . He had new industrial regulations adopted and began a campaign to clean up Shanghai . Factory owners had to spend a little money to protect the lives they used , and sometimes to pay for the hospital expenses of injured workers or even to improve their diet . But his authority was very limited . Chinese could be brought to book only in courts full of bribery . Foreigners were protected by extraterritoriality . Progress was ended by the war in 1937 . I well remember stumbling through the burned-out shell of the Shanghai industrial world with Alley after the Japanese occupation . More than 1.10,000 business and factory buildings and houses were demolished . China 's main industrial base , such as it was , lay immobilized after but three months of battle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort to inject a little decency into Asiatic industry . Under his terse comments the twisted iron and shattered masonry took on dying breath and body . He knew the personal stories of hundreds of workers and technicians now thrown out of jobs . " It would n't be so bad , " he would dourly observe , " to have demolished this wretched circus , if something better would take its place . That 's the worst of it . Japanese conquest means organized degradation on a really efficient scale , doping workers with morphine and heroin instead of giving them wages , and reducing life to unbelievable levels of bestiality . Before the war we picked up an average of thirty thousand unidentified corpses from the streets every year . Under the sun-goddess myths the number will be doubled . " China was doomed , Alley warned officials and technicians , unless she found a method to mobilize her labor power and resources in a scientific way , eliminating waste of human life and mate . rials . Eventually he himself offered the solution . It was his idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wartime needs and the social structure of China ? small decentralized industry spread over the towns and villages instead of concentrated in the cities , industry in which labor and capital could really work together , industry that could not only win the war but also win the peace . Alley became convinced that his plan for Industrial Co-operatives could combine speedy wartime reconstruction , productive refugee relief to supplant soup kitchens , the training and spiritual mobilization of labor , and a means of quickly opening up the hinterland to defense against conquest . Thousands of Industrial Co-ops Several basic realities favored the scheme . First , the war blocked off most of interior China , so that domestic industry was for the duration guaranteed an expanding market . Second , China 's labor power , with millions of refugees fleeing before the Nipponese hordes , was almost unlimited . Third , the greater part of China 's rich raw materials lay in areas not likely to be occupied for years . Government plans ignored some of these fundamentals . Orthodox Chinese economists , trained abroad , could think only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiasts , forming around Alley , argued that China had neither the money nor time nor technical facilities to build big industry . They prudently advised against too many eggs in one basket , for it was clear that all big industrial concentrations would be bombed . The Japanese could not bomb every village and farm in China , and it was there that industrial co-operatives would be built . Thousands of them-30,000 was the goal  --  camouflaged neatly to fit into the rustic scene . Finally , it was necessary not only to mobilize idle labor and capital quickly but to train and educate labor in its duties of citizenship , to give it a stake in national independence . For this reason Alley insisted on a co-operative plan which involved a kind of partnership between the workers and the owners of capital . In all this he saw more than a wartime measure . He envisaged a healthier industrial life of the future  --  perhaps that reconciliation of industry with the fresh air of the countryside of which his father had dreamed . One morning I went with Alley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SATURDAY EVENING POST February 8.1941 ( Continued ! ram Page 36 ) Clark Kerr . He had been interested in the Indusco scheme and had asked me to bring on the New Zealander . It was an odd interview and seemed to me to leave everything unsaid , but I suppose it was typically British . Sir Archibald made a judgment of Alley 's character in five minutes  --  from then on he gave bis complete support . He staked his reputation and prestige to persuade the Generalissimo and Madame Chiang to adopt the Indusco plan and to engage Alley to carry it out . China 's own economic experts were inclined to scoff . The Old China Hands also ridiculed . Chinese " work together " ? They could not co-operate . But the Generalissimo listened attentively to Alley when , after the ambassador secured his release from the Shanghai Council , he came to Hankow at the government 's invitation . " The old Chinese guild was a kind of cooperative , " Alley said . " The Chinese family itself is a primitive co-operative . Very well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Generalissimo and Madame Chiang were impressed . So was Madame Sun Yat-sen , who saw in Indusco the epitome of Doctor Sun 's Principle of Livelihood . As a result , Alley got a cautious green light to go ahead . Never before , I believe , had a foreigner been given such wide responsibility for the actual organization of a socio-economic movement in China . The Bailie-Ford Boys Alley 's strategy- divides a territory about the size of Europe into three great " zones of industrial defense " ? from very light and even " mobile " front-line industries , near or behind enemy lines , to third-line , or rear-area primary industries . Built in small corn-pact units , these workshops develop their own sources of raw materials and power , and their own transport , and operate training schools and marketing organizations . Such a comprehensive plan required the leadership of able engineers and skilled technicians . Alley mobilized them from a group of American-returned students , who call themselves the " Bailie-Ford Boys " after the revered missionary , Joseph Bailie , and Henry Ford , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who believed that the test of Christianity lay in its ability to improve men 's livelihood  --  an idea to which he wona hardheaded convert in Detroit . Henry Ford agreed that scientific knowledge , given to youths indoctrinated with a Christian concept of industry , could do more to bring about social progress in Asia than any amount of evangelism . They made an agreement whereby Ford financed a kind of postgraduate factory school for a number of " ethically conditioned " Chinese graduates of American engineering colleges . Bailie-Ford students hated waste , and to them Shanghai industry was wasteful and inefficient from beginning to end . They believed it should not he in Shanghai at all , but rationally developed near China 's own raw materials in the interior . But these ideas got a poor reception from the bureaucrats and mandarins , and the engineers had little opportunity to practice their principles before the war . After Bailie died , Rewi Alley became a kind of spiritual force holdiig the group together . From the start he counted on their assistance to make Indusco succeed . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiasm , backed by a small administrative fund from the Executive Yuan . It was Alley 's mottoes , " Get things moving , " " First things first , " and " Work together , " that prevailed . Before long , dozens of professional people , returned students and gifted technicians begun to volunteer to work for wages that scarcely paid for their food and shelter . Trained minds , disgusted with politicians and bureaucrats , here got a chance to use their brains . Alley 's spirit of " the new heroism of construction " proved contagious . He preached : " Every undeveloped resource is a challenge to the youth of China . The unused water power , the untouched minerals , the untrained millions around us  --  all these are the only means of building better men and women , better families and a better society . We must realize that to make our own little machines that do the job required is better than sitting with folded hands because we can not import big modern turbines . We must learn to see the adventure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniforms and public notice . " Hundreds of youth have now become organizers and technicians . Thousands of skilled craftsmen have been mobilized , and thousands of new ones trained from refugees and farmers . Thousands more await only capital to put them to work . At a recent Indusco exhibit in Chungking , officials were amazed to see virtually every consumer necessity , and representing more than fifty different types of industry . War supplies are being turned out in increasing quantities . Alley promises that Indusco can eventually make China 's guerrilla armies self-sufficient in light arms  --  if it receives the necessary backing . Behind the swift recovery are countless individual epics of the tenacity and ingenuity of hundreds of industrial organizers and adult workers and courageous factory apprentices . Alley himself speaks only of them . But as I trace back the greatest of those stories I see that scarcely one can be told independently of the inspiration of Alley 's own personality . Try to imagine someone like Lin Yutang as the main coordinator of a new type of mass education in America  --  and succeeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredible in China Where most Chinese officials try to apply mandates from business remote from the people , Alley seeks his solutions by living the job with the man in the field . What 's wrong with the match factory in Hunan ? It needs an engineering renovation , and Alley brings down the right man for the job . Elsewhere , certain dyes can no longer be imported . Alley remembers an old craftsman who knew the secrets of the ancient Chinese dyes , and somehow induces him to do the work . In another place Alley sees refugees starving while tons of straw and bamboo are wasted . A hurried note in Chinese brings an expert in to start a paper industry ; printing and publishing and other shops follow . Is a resourceful lad required to smuggle essential tools past enemy lines to equip a new machine shop ? Alley calls upon a whimsical London-born Cockney Chinese , who , after a dozen narrow escapes , reports that he has " outwitted the other swine " to complete the task . The magnitude of his effort can perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine , " as Clark Kerr calls him , During the first two years he covered more than 18,000 miles . or a distance about six times the width of the United States . And believe someone who has covered a little of this bomb-torn land  --  with practically no railways and few motor roads , 18,000 miles is something to boast about . Pedaling bicycles , hitch-hiking from village to village on army trucks , riding an ambulance or a horse into combat zones , but more often stomping along on his own tireless legs , Alley leads the C. I. C. staff to carry the message of working together into the farthest corner of the country . He himself organized many of the existing shops , from those in the guerrilla armies near Shanghai to Mohammedan spinners and weavers in distant Kansu . And always under skies dark with enemy bombers . " What is the biggest thrill you 've had in these two years ? " I asked him one day , expecting to hear of one of his many narrow escapes . He replied , " One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edgl of Mongolia when we heard tinkling bells and stepped aside as a long ca van of camels came out of the mitt their breath turning to frost in the bit ter air . As they went by we wen amazed to see the lead camel can-yin the huge silk banner of Indusco , antl our blue-and-red triangle emblazon on the big boxes of freight . " Itwas a camel-pullers ' co-operati hauling guerrilla products . The m with me , up from the warm south , su denly realized they were part of so thing that covered a whole nation . Ha they cheered those camels as th snorted past . Yes , that was a thrill Crutches for Wounded Soldiers The only thing comparable to it , Alley continued , was the welcome he received in a little town in Southern Kiangsi . Here he came unexpectedly upon a crowd of crippled soldierN herded into a depressing camp with nothing to do . Now , it happened that during the Shanghai war Alley had helped organize these same soldiers in a temporary home , to which he used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line of orthopedics  --  his idea of an interesting afternoon . " They keep asking for work to do , " he would say with the most astounding sense of personal responsibility . " If only we had some shops where they could make things . The best crutch yo can give a wounded man is a job a work to do . " And now in Kiangsi he came upo his friends again . They already knew all about Indusco . Under the skills men in their midst they had organized themselves so well that Alley had little to do but put his technicians to work finding tools and machines and raw materials for them , and lending capital to add to the tiny sums they had saved from their pensions . Today the crippled soldiers ' co-ops are the model workshops of that region , doing printing , bookbinding , weaving , cigarette making and half a dozen other jobs . " This is the best orthopedics yet ( Li covered , " Alley told the generals  --  who are now taking the hint in oth camps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war as Alley has . His journeys take him through spots infested with bubonic plague , relapsing fever and other epidemics . Last year in Kiangsi he came down with typhoid . For a month , during daily air raids , he hud to be carried , dripping with fever , 1 from an improvised hospital in a kerosene store to a refuge across a river in the fields . Somehow he came out of it as energetic as ever . During this illness the bishop of Hong Kong sent in by plane a foreign specialist to save Alley 's life . After sharing the perils and the food there , the specialist came out vowing never again . But for days he went about Hong Kong talking of Alley . " A saint , " he told everybody in an awed voice . " I went in there and found a saint . " Alley let out a hearty roar when he heard that . " What about the four hundred million Chinese who have been living the same way ever since the war began ? " he asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bandage for their wounds ? There are n't any saints . There are only people who do the job reciTuoirtedheoef htihne ' esmethereabouts Ailey is better known as Mr. Big Nose . The story came to me from Alley himself . He was riding in an ancient bus one day when a bearded elder in front of him spoke to the youth alongside . " Chinese make better aviators than foreigners , " he said ; " they can see on all sides . " The youth asked , " Is that really true ? " " True enough , " the old man exclaimed . " If you do n't believe me , just take a look at that Big Nose behind us . Do you mean to tell me a man can see around an obstacle like that ? " And he shook his head with profound skepticism . It is in just such simple ingenuousness of the people that Alley finds his daily " adventure . " I saw him in Chengtu not long ago , far over in Western Szechwan . He had just walked eighty miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few Chinese dare go unaccompanied byarmedescort . Nota word of complaint of nights in the filthy inns or the diet of maize and buttered tea , but an outburst of enthusiasm about the gold in the streams and the highland sheep  --  and the Living Buddha . He had just won over that god to Indusco . Incredulous , I asked him how he had done it . " The Tibetans still spin their wool with their hands , in the ancient Egyptian manner , and the old gentleman had never even seen a modern spinning wheel , " Alley said . " There is no power there at all , and only handicraft industry is possible . I took one of our new wheels with me , and it brought him out of his depression . He said he was bored with being a Living Buddha and wanted something useful to do . So we made him head of our first depot in the Sungpan Valley . Wonderful wool there . In a few years we 'll have power and a good spinning industry . " Starting a Button Factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tibetans was Alley 's night ride across the narrow mountain trails with the wild horsemen there . He demonstrated his ability to take it in the local manner  --  which consisted of swilling down their torchy brandy , passed from horse to horse on the gallop . Sad lapse in the conduct of a saint . Alley has a sharp eye for details that everyone else misses . He wrote to me from Kansu : " The industry we are starting here will permeate throughout the whole northwest . Splendid wool , all we need to equip the army . " And then abruptly : " We want a button industry I There are still Japanese buttons , toothbrushes and such , being sold at terrific prices  --  overcoat buttons , a dollar a pair ! Yet just outside the city the dust heaps are covered with animal bones . I 'm getting some expert button and knife makers here to start work .

" In the northern guerrilla districts Alley has several hundred mobile industries operating . When , under Japanese attack , Chinese forces temporarily withdraw from a town , industry now goes with them . Organized in compact units , the guerrilla shops can move all their machines and operators to safety within a few hours , In a Shansi town behind the Japanese lines Alley set up a printing shopwith 600 young men who can shoot as well as set type . Among other things , that plant prints a daily paper with a circulation of 30,000 . Recently the Japanese invaded the area on a mopping-up expedition . The whole plant was moved by the operators in one night  --  and the next day 's paper came out on time . Such triumphs cheer Alley 's fighting Irish soul as he tramps across China 's backlands .

New capital of $40,000 , - 000 was recently made available by Chinese banks , at last convinced of Indusco 's commercial success . Alley predicts that if further necessary help is forthcoming , production will reach a figure of a billion dollars annually within three years . " The war has taught China that she must industrialize in a decent way or perish as a slave nation . Democratic co-operative industry is the way out , not only for China but for all the backward Oriental countries , if they want to avoid disastrous class wars . " With his demonstration that his ideas will work , Alley has become an international figure and Indusco is being closely studied by other Oriental leaders .

Who can say that in the end Rewi Alley 's achievement may not prove of more lasting benefit to mankind than the current battles of empire  --  may not , in fact , be the most constructive result of the battle for Asia itself ? As for Alley , he says the effort has only begun . " It is n't what we have done but what we can yet do , " he keeps repeating . " Our goal is still thirty thousand workshops , fitted into the background of the vast landscape of rural China . When we reach it , the Japanese will then roll up their funny little swords in their bedding mats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Measured by American standards , all the industry of China is small change indeed and its problems bear little resemblance to ours . But measured against the emergency needs of its own people , Indusco looms large . Judged against the difficulties already overcome , the experiment surely stands as a living monument to a great people 's apparent readiness to " fight on forever and ever ! " And to one man in particular , who loves human life as much as he hates waste , and admires work above all things . Which is , I suppose , why Alley prefers to call himself " China 's No . I White Coolie. "
