Stanford 's shrewd President Ray Lyman Wilbur and his trustees were not born yesterday : they know how to take advantage of a trend by going against it . Last week , as liberal arts colleges all over the nation rushed to accelerate the arts of war ( mathematics and science ) . President Wilbur &; trustees announced that Stanford , which has never had a liberal arts college , will start one next fall . <P> Rich , successful Stanford , known to its students as " The Farm " despite its $30,000,000 endowment and magnificent , red-roofed Spanish mission quadrangles , is the most popular university in the West . Like other universities , Stanford has adapted its curriculum to " the technological demands of war " ; its new School of Humanities is founded on the belief that war is not eternal . <P> Originator of the School of Humanities was English Professor John Wendell Dodds , younger brother of Princeton 's President Harold Dodds . Pondering Stanford 's lack of a liberal arts school , Professor Dodds dreamed up one which would avoid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smattering of subjects . . . a lack of cross-fertilization of ideas . " <P> The School of Humanities will absorb the old School of Letters ( literature and languages ) , include arts , history , languages and literature , speech and drama , music , philosophy . Cutting across department lines , it will have a basic course devoted to " study of man as a rational and artistic being seeking to understand himself and the universe in which he lives . " <P> On hand for the school 's launching at a luncheon in San Francisco 's Bohemian Club was Humanist Lewis Mumford . Said he : " Here is a challenge to a fresh creative effort in education . . . the production of complete human beings , harmoniously disciplined to create within themselves and within their society the order that will banish the barbarous mechanisms and the mechanized barbarisms that now threaten us.
