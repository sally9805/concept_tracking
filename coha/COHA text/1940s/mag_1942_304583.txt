Squat , barrel-chested , Norwegian-born Bernt Balchen was one of the great U.S. peacetime heroes . He began flying more than 20 years ago , piloted Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd across the Atlantic in 1927 and over the South Pole in 1929 . Last week Bernt Balchen , now a 42-year-old U.S. Army colonel , was back in a hero 's role again-this time in barren , ice-capped Greenland . <P> A Flying Fortress with 13 men aboard smacked down on its belly 100 miles in land on the treacherous Greenland icecap . Balchen and young ( 32 ) Navy Lieut . Aram Parunak , a onetime Ursinus College football hero , teamed to try a rescue . <P> But the Fortress was weeks away by foot , and no plane had ever landed intentionally on the jagged , crevasse-slashed icecap . Parunak and Balchen , in a PBY flying boat , surveyed for six days , drop ping sleeping bags and food , never daring a landing . The stranded men watched and bit chapped lips . On the seventh day they saw the flying boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had found a " dimple " of water filling an ice valley twelve miles away , had chanced a landing on this temporary lake . He set Balchen 's rescue party ashore , then took off again to direct them to the Fortress . The rescue party fought its way on skis through a heavy storm , reached the Fortress after two days , got the crew back to the lake . Pilot Parunak landed again , picked them up . It was just in time . Next day the shifting icecap swallowed up the lake . <P> As Balchen and Parunak rested from this exploit , an Army patrol plane , with two men aboard , flopped down in a glacier canyon . One man was badly injured ; there was no time for a two weeks ' overland rescue . Four miles away was a lake . Its milky waters concealed rocks that could spell doom for a landing plane , but Pilot Parunak set his flying boat down , somehow , anyway . While Balchen and his rescue party trudged to the stranded patrol plane , Pilot Parunak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After this rescue , Parunak and Balchen gave themselves a name : " Greenland Cooperative Salvage Co. "
