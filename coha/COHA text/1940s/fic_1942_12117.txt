No scenery is needed . Act on a platform in the center of your auditorium with the audience on all sides or on a bare stage . An air raid siren sounds and ten flag bearers run across stage with ten red flags . A vivid red light shines on some people singing and then drains to a pale morning light that proceeds toward right as the play goes on . More people enter and more until the platform is filled with singing people , waiting . If possible a loudspeaker should be overheard . The people sing : Russia is always , Red is our color , The blood of martyrs , These , no other . Comrades eternal : New commandment One people eternal Blessing the earth . How they oppressed us Under the Czar , Dragged us and stabbed us , Blood in the snow . Again in danger Gather together Every hand To strike the invader . Then that winter : Revolution havoc Over the land Slaughter possessed us . Nothing can stop us , Our endless people Moving forward Tidal wave evil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANNOUNCER On Russia , Russia , what a hymn you sing ! You are here in Moscow 's Red Square Waiting , as one hundred and ninety-four million Russians all over their vast country Are waiting for an announcement from the Kremlin . Wait with us . It is important to wait and be silent . The announcement will come soon . I say wait . Russia is a country of winters ; From the Siberia to the Black Sea , And the Ural Mountains and the Caucasus Mountains , The boundaries at Poland , At Finland , across from Alaska , the boundaries at China , By Hungary , along Rumania , the boundaries at Turkey . A man has just entered the square with a large Russian flag , The people make a path for him . He plants it in the square . The flag is red and in the corner there is a yellow hammer And a yellow sickle and a star over them , Showing that the workers love this land , That Russia is their land and this is their flag . More people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They look up at the flag planted there , You can read their bill of rights on their foreheads .

Whoever shall ascend into her vastness Shall have a pure heart and a clean mind : Whoever shall love her people Shall love the bright wilderness of the human spirit ! Nothing can avail against these comrade crusaders Who drove the money changers from their temple Whose dream is rooted in granite and steel , Whose reality is a sermon on the mount . p. 3 VOICE People of the Soviets !

For the people are not conquered And ghosts stand all over Europe . It is enough that the dead stand guard Haunting the invader . They shall not pass .

( At the end of the **27;129;TOOLONG , there is great machine gun fire and under the fire the sound of marching feet moving forward inimitable. ) p. 5 VOICE They have come ; we stood ; we died , but we did not retreat . A whole city wiped out , only four left , wounded But wait  --  we are not defeated . ( The stage is filled with the Russian dead . There are only four defenders left and they are wounded .

( The officer rasps out an order . ) ( There is gunfire . ) The prisoners are dead . They think the prisoners are dead . ( The officer rasps out an order and the little army stands at attention .

He tries to run but two Russians stand quietly , before him . The army has retreated at a rapid pace . The Russians begin the hand grenade movement after them and each time they throw in the direction of the retreating army there is an explosion . A Russian guards the officer. ) p. 7 GERMAN OFFICER ( Screaming . ) You are conquered , conquered ! Do you not know when you are conquered .

The enemy conquered vast territories But their pride was strangled , They were left frozen under wooden crosses in frozen earth . The people fought on , fought on and on . There will be no end until the enemy is driven out Like rats to the empty submerged islands of defeat . ( The last guerrilla is alone on stage  --  the officer has been taken off shouting : " You are conquered . " The fighter runs to the end of the stage and calls : ) GUERILLA FIGHTER Natashya , run to the forest . Hide , hide and snipe them as they come . They 're coming now . Run , Natashya , run .

Kill thousands a day , Machine gun us  --  we will be here Waiting still ; fighting your dragons . Each hour we are born again . In 1918 you invaded the Ukraine , The people have not forgotten ; You were blood in the snow . Napoleon marched to ruin Moscow , and wept at his victory ; A burnt offering : And all the dead on the road back to France In the thirteenth century , even then , You invaded the Ukraine , And you were blood in the snow . Red in the snow our enemies always lie ! ( The defense movement begins . ) When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crack armies cracked ; The people did not retreat , Even the children gathered wood in the forest .

( A triumphant Shostakovitch symphony swells up and continues until the song at the end . ) When the Germans came , Goose-stepping to defeat , The Russians played their music in their cities , Loud and wonderful it sounded With the bombs crashing like chords of victory .

VOICE Bury your dead and fight on , and on , and on ! ANNOUNCER That day in Leningrad when three thousand comrades Were placed in the frozen earth by frozen hands And all the red banners waving over them Like hot breath in the climax of their winter , An ice-age day  --  The mourners in gunny sacks , The daily newspapers tied about their feet , Tears ran down their faces and froze on their chins . ( A lone voice begins the song and the people take it up after the first stanza . ) Somebody began to sing strong and unsad While the strong men shoveled ice and dirt on the dead , The people took up the song , Exultation hovered in the air . Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ martyrs , These , no other . Barbaric music Plays in our land , Stir us to burn Our cities to save them . How they oppressed us Under the Czar , Dragged us and stabbed us : Blood in the snow .

Restore to all peoples The feeling blessed Of hope forever And wonderful love . Comrades eternal : A new commandment : One people eternal Blessing the earth . The crooked cross Unsymbol it now , Bury it deep In erasing earth . Again in danger Gather together Every hand To strike the invader . Drink to comrades Under the snow Fallen forever But living too . Nothing can stop us ; Our endless people Moving forward Tidal wave the invaders . Russia always , Red is our color , The blood of martyrs , These , no other . Fight to save goodness , All people together Marching together Freedom the banner Leading forever ( The people move off as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red and the music swells up wonderfully. )
