From his flagship , westward bound for the Marshall Islands , the commander of the Bikini atom-bomb test broadcast to the U.S. : " Another Operation Crossroads is about to be executed by the Columbia Broadcasting System in ... the Library of Congress . . . . Representative Americans . . . have gathered to consider with you the great crossroads to which the splitting of the atom has brought mankind . ... I think it will be of great importance . . . . " Thus Vice Admiral William H. P. Blandy last week introduced one of radio 's greatest public-service programs . <P> Around the red-carpeted stage in the Library 's Coolidge auditorium , experts and plain people spoke their hopes and fears , their doubts and convictions. * There were no sound effects , no musical bridge between speakers , no corny gags . CBS thought the question of the age demanded straight answers . The program 's success was due in large part to that approach-and also to one of the most painstaking preparations ever made for a single broadcast . <P> CBS Boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R. Murrow and Davidson Taylor , conceived Operation Crossroads while chinning about their European wartime experiences . They assigned the project to a 32-year-old producer , Robert Lewis Shayon ( rhymes with play-on ) . To find what the nation was thinking , CBS began a public-opinion survey last December . Shayon talked with scientists , military experts , Government leaders . Then he sponged up everything he could about atomic energy . <P> Upper-Level Lowdown . He found a lot of confused , ignorant thinking about the bomb . " The facts were circulating freely in the upper intellectual level , " he recalls , " but not getting through to the people . " He set out to find a program formula that would get the facts through . <P> First he listed the questions most generally asked : Is there a defense ? Should we keep the secret ? Should we destroy all our bombs ? Is it as deadly as we have been led to believe ? What about Russia ? CBS station managers throughout the U.S. suggested candidates for his panel . Shayon traveled some 10,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own way , Shayon produced more eloquence than a Corwin drama . Every mispronounced word and stumbling inflection underlined the program 's honesty . <P> A Washington fireman asked : " Why do n't we find a defense against the atomic bomb ? " He got his answer from Air Forces General George C. Kenney : " There just is n't any adequate defense against atomic attack . " <P> Mrs. Howard J. Hollister of Minneapolis , who lost three sons in the war , thought the best defense was keeping the atom bomb secret . Said Nobel Prizewinning Scientist Dr. Harold Urey : " There is no secret that we can keep for more than a few years . ... All we have exclusively now are merely . . . manufacturing processes .
