txt The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has appealed to the Of-flee of Defense Transportation for a modification of the order which will cut between 300 and 400 trains from the passenger schedules of four New England railroads beginning at midnight tomorrow . Acting Governor Arthur W. Coolidge sought from Col. J. Monroe Johnson , Director of the ODT , the recall of that part of his order which forbids substitution of Diesel engines for coal-burning locomotives . " As much of the long-haul passenger service on Massachusetts is by Diesel trains , your proposed curtailment of steam passenger service would cut deepest into short hauls and commuter service , " Mr. Coolidge telegraphed Mr. Johnson . " During the 1946 coal strike , Diesel power was substituted for steam . If you permit the 1946 arrangement now , some of the inconveniences can be avoided . If you do not , persons wive jobs require daily travel will suffer .

Lewis today weighed two invitations , both aimed at ending the soft coal shutdown . One was a bid from Cyrus Ching , Director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service , for a conference with mine operators March 22 to make a new attempt at settling a pension dispute . The other was a letter from the mine owners , who said that if Mr. Lewis wanted to discuss the pension demands with them , he first would have to send the 350,000 idle miners back to digging coal . Greater Boston commuters will be seriously affected by the order which necessitates the canceling of 341 local trains .
