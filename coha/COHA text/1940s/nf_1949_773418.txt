The very nature of the system itself ? and above all , its existence among a people who had grown up ( and were still growing up ) out of a struggle for freedom and for plenty of elbowroom ? had split the American social and moral conscience down the middle . And economically and politically , nothing before had ever divided us like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waged ( all but the shooting ) between the large southern planters and the big northern industrialists . We were breaking apart from within . And externally , our old enemy England , and other potential foes , were waiting to pounce on whatever might remain once we had devoured each other . The death of our slowly progressing unity was near . The skies were really black naw ? and it was night , with no moon shining , or stars to guide us . There was such a night in Gethsemane ? and now we needed the arm and the spirit of one who was still living and who had also come out of the wilderness . We needed to hear his voice . At last we could hear him coming ? yes , and out of the wilderness . Out of Kentucky and Indiana and Illinois , where there was still a frontier not too far from the serious issues of the day . We listened in gratitude ( scarcely believing our ears ) as we heard his slow but firm footsteps walking toward us . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the village post office , shaking the provincial dust of the old law office from his feet ) and he was here : He spoke in a singsong kind of voice , not plain like the rest of him . " I presume you all know who I am , " he said . " I am humble Abraham Lincoln , " c /Z rteen U N I O N As He died to make men holy , Let us die to make men free . JULIA WARD HOWE AMONG THE MARTYRS Even before Abraham Lincoln was elected to succeed Buchanan , the slaveholders ' man , the fighting had begun . It started in the " west " ? in Kansas and Missouri , where the issue of slavery had already split the land and the people into north and south . It began there , but it subsided at Harper 's Ferry in Virginia , with the capture of the patriarchal man who had sworn to take no rest till slavery was crushed . God 's angry man , he was called , and he lay in prison under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of freedom . Like that other John of ancient days who preceded the Martyr among martyrs , John Brown had also come out of the wilderness ? to lead his sons and other followers ( Negro and white ) in his avowed war to bring back freedom among men . He lay in prison now , waiting to be hanged . He still had a few letters to read , among them one from a Quaker woman in Rhode Island : Dear Friend : Thy letter of the 1st of this month , in which thee acknowledges the reception of my first letter , and says thee would be grateful for another from me , has quickened every pulse of my woman 's heart . I am very happy that it is within my power , even in so humble a manner , to contribute somewhat to thy consolation . Besides , I am , 153 // if possible , even happier to know from thyself that the opinion which thousands of Friends entertain in regard to thy attempt at Harper 's Ferry is not incorrect ? but that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that thou didst undertake that brave and heroic work from the promptings of a strong religious concern . I have said before that the members of our Society , being non-resistants , do not generally approve of taking up arms ; but , as during the war for independence , the patriotism of some Friends overcame their scruples on this point ? so that they fought for liberty ? so now I am of opinion that Friends approve thy intentions , and readily pardon the means employed in the nobleness of thy zeal for the poor slaves that thou mightst obtain liberty for them . Indeed , if it is ever right to take the sword in order to contend in defense of great principles , then , by all the circumstances of thy life , that right has been thine . If Lafayette won the lasting gratitude of the American people , because he rendered aid in the great strife for freedom , they should not fail at the same time to remember that he gave his fortune and himself to the cause of those who were legally in rebellion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a self-sacrifice . Thy fortune and thy life , like his , have been consecrated to the cause of human freedom . The red-taped circumlocution office of Buchanan 's government may idolize the name of Lafayette , and seek to censure thee . But future history ? which , like God 's eye , views all things impartially ? will justly rank thee , if a less successful , yet a not less honored defender of human rights . Yes , it is true , as well said by thee , that Christ armed Peter with a sword . If thee believes thyself , as called by thy inward spirit and sincere conscience to have been chosen to the work which thou hast undertaken , then thou hast no guilt in the sight of God , in that act . It is not obedience to human , but to divine laws , that makes our actions right . Thus the word shows us that many of God 's most eminent servants have been those who were called to violate human laws in behalf of truth and justice , and very many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and others mentioned by thee , shall be cared for by me , and I trust by all Friends , to the extent of my poor ability . Whatever can be done for their comfort or welfare , within my power , shall be very earnestly contributed . 0 , I do pray that thy poor wife , and all those of thy family living , // may have much sympathy , and very many friends ? for my heart bleeds for them in their great sorrow ! Now my dear friend , what can I say to thee more ! I , that God would be very near thee and bless thee ! My heart , filled with sympathy for thee as it is , thrilled with joy when I learned that my dear Sister , Lydia Child , offered to nurse thee . How willingly would my hands perform that office for thee , if circumstances per-mitted ! ... God be with thee ? and , if thee does never hear from me again , know that my fearful prayers are ever for thee . If thou must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ martyrs . Read the Word much , and find there how those who were martyrs for a righteous cause shall be most honored in a future life . Remember that Jesus was legally executed ? but that he died in be . half of justice and humanity ! ... If , now , my letters have furnished thee even one little moment of comfort , I am a thousand-fold repaid . God bless thee ! Farewell ! REBEL PLANT We said farewell to him ( but not good-by ) . A year later , Lincoln was elected , and the slave states commenced to break away from the others . Was that how it would be ? Two of us instead of one ? two of us on this one continent we had gained together ? Two thin saplings , and on unproved soil , where our single , towering liberty tree had grown ? Mr. Lincoln gave the answer without much delay : he was not particularly interested in the slavery question ( he deplored the institution for slave and master alike ) , but he was determined that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be held together . It would cost considerable ? in lives and property , in energy and suffering ( and time , that could be spent to the satisfying purpose of building a home for our grandchildren ? if our children already had one ) . But the challenge could no longer be turned aside after the Confederacy of southern states was formed and its gray-clad army of close // to half a million men was established under the expert command of General Robert E. Lee ( of our old , beloved Virginia , of course , grandson of Richard Henry himself ) . The deadly war among ourselves was underway . As the fighting and burning , the Iooting and killing , continued from Bull Run to Antietam , Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville , both sides grew more cruel and more ruthless toward each other and even toward the civilians in the " enemy " country . Union soldiers returning to the north brought back seeds of a tall lavender-colored plant that flowered in the Hudson Valley and became known as " the rebel plant . " But that was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was not all they brought back : The Yankees . . . staid here all that day , camped in the same place that night , and left next day ? but they ruined us all before they left . I ca n't begin to tell you what they done to other people ? it would take so long ? but will try and tell you how they treated us . They came here thicker than they did before if possible . All day working like ants , all over the house ? upstairs and down , in every hole and corner , searching and peeping everywhere . Carried off every Irish potato , beet , onion , beans ? even took time to pick pans of beans . Took my pillow-cases to put them in ! Took towels , one new tablecloth , all my knives but three , some of my dishes , and every pan they could find . . . Took my shears , Asa 's hatchet . Tore my house all to pieces ? it would take me a week to mess it up like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closets , and examined them . Took all Asa 's clothes they could find . Worked here all day ? I reckon two hundred had been upstairs , looked around , and came down . I followed after them , until I was nearly broke down ? scared nearly to death for fear they would find my things that were hid ( for I knew that was my all : provision , clothes , bed-clothes , blankets and everything was in there ) . After awhile , about a dozen of the infantry came in , and upstairs they went to searching all about . Commenced looking under the floor ? I had a few things hid under there . They commenced pulling them // out : pulled out medicine , tobacco , cards and other little things , but did not seem to want anything but the tobacco . After awhile , one rascal went up in the corner , and in stooping to put his hand under the floor , put it against the planks ? and they slipped a little . He pulled them off , and says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place ! " They just ripped the planks off and in they went . One says , " Run down and guard the door ? do n't let another fellow come up . We 'll divide the things amongst us . " I had in there , meat , flour , sugar , coffee , molasses , lard and salt . All of Asa 's good clothes , Sarah 's , mine , and the children 's . We all had new clothes in there that we had not worn ? in a pillow-case . They pulled them all out and looked at them . I stood over them ? and as they would pull out the shoes and clothes , I would grab them and tell them that they could not have them . But every time they came to anything of Asa 's they would take it . Took his overcoat , a pair of new blue jeans , pants , three pair of summer pants , all his drawers except the ones he had on , one shirt , a new silk handkerchief . So you know he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of my clothes ? except pocket handkerchiefs . Sarah and me both had some new handkerchiefs . They got them all ? and would have taken our dresses if we had not fought over them so . As they pulled them out , I would take them from them and throw them to Sarah . She would sit down on them , until she had a large pile under her . She said she would fight over them a long time before they got them . They took two of her dresses , that were left hanging in her room , and Melia 's white embroidered dress ? it was hanging in one of Sarah 's . We do n't know who took them . Every room was full at once ; we could not watch them all . They were old dresses of Sarah 's ? she hid all her best ones ( her pink flounce and dark-striped skirt ) . I hate their taking Melia 's very much , because it came from where it did . I gave Sarah my purple flounce muslin in the place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on in three summers ) . They took one of my best quilts , and three nice blankets ? but I stole one of them from him after he got it . He laid it down by him to divide the provision . I slipped up behind him and got it . There was such confusion amongst them he never discovered it . They left me nothing to eat at all . Took every solitary thing I had , except one jar of lard and my salt . There was not even a grain of corn // on the place to make hominy after they were gone ? and we 'd had enough of everything to last us till Christmas ! I hated their taking my chickens and groceries worse than anything else . I knew we could get meat and bread as soon as they left , but the other things can not be replaced without sending to Memphis ( and we have no memphis ) . We were living well , but will have to live on meat and bread after this , and we may not be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Asa 's hogs for next year 's meat , but we happened to save our cows . They killed nearly everybody 's cows and calves around here but ours . We have two good cows with young calves . They happened not to come up until very late . We turned them in the yard and kept them there . My calves were in the orchard . They started to shoot them several times , but I ran after them and begged them not to kill them ? told them they had taken everything I had to eat , but if they would leave the calves that we could live on milk and bread .. . There was a general stampede with the Negroes when they left . Forty of Mr. Flournoy 's went ? he only had ten left , and the most of them are children ( Caesar , his wife and three children , Florella and child , and Harriet 's three children are left , and Cynthia , Mary 's nurse ? I forgot her , that makes eleven ) . . . Even old Cyrus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old . TO STAND THEIR GROUND The slaves were leaving whenever they could get away ? and especially now that the Emancipation Proclamation had declared them to be free . Old and young , they were hurrying toward the new horizons of freedom opening before them ( open wide those pearly gates ! ) . Men who had once been slaves , or who were the descendants of slaves , were fighting , too , in the Union armies . More than once , and in the midst of prejudice and hatred from their own comrades in arms , they helped to turn an imminent retreat into a successful attack : Dear Mother : I am using the regular infantry desk ( namely a drum ) to write upon . My last letter left me on board the steamer Maple Leaf ? which steamer by the way was the most abominably managed concern // I ever saw . The morning before we landed , the cook , mate and Captain had a fight , which ended by the cook 's being put in irons and all breakfast being kept out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hard-tack and coffee . However , it did not trouble us much though all the officers from the Senior Captain downwards were very indignant with the way in which the Captain of the steamer treated us . The opinion of most was that he did n't care to trouble himself much about the officers of a negro regiment . Well , on Monday , somewhere about noon , we landed at Pawnee Landing on Folly Island and marched up the beach nearly to the creek which separates Folly and Morris islands . We pitched our camp right on the beach . Most of the men had their shelter tents which they stuck up , while we officers bunked in the sand . The way the sand fleas and flies bite is a caution . However , we came out alive in the morning , although the officer of the guard did very considerately wake me up about half past two to inform me that my company must be ready with the officers to start for fatigue duty at half past six A.M. So when half past six A.M. came , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all . You see we only had some four and a half companies , the halves of two companies being at the landing and the other four and a half being somewhere or other ( heaven knows where ) . We got to Morris Island and Capt . Wales and I were ordered to start up the beach with Capt . Pratt who had charge of the expedition . We trudged up some two miles on a good sand beach and then struck off and walked through some of the most tiresome sand I ever came across , until we reached a place some three quarters of a mile from Fort Wagner . We were set to work to fill sand-bags  --  and a mighty easy work we had of it . It took each man about two hours to do his stent : which was to fill twenty-five bags , and after that each man filled five more for love . In all we filled some 3000 or 4000 bags . One part of Capt . Wales 's company was set to work building a bridge in full sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them much ? except that they threw three shells about half way between where we were at work and the bridge . It was the first time I had ever heard the whizz of a shell coming toward me . I heard it when it first left the gun and then lost the sound , but caught it again as it came nearer ? when it sounded just as I should have supposed a solid shot would have sounded if sent through water . 16o UPON THIS CONTINENT The bursting and the whizzing of the shell made some of the men rather timid . One man was so overcome that he fell back into a puddle and came out a most filthy spectacle . The men got through their work in about a quarter of the time allotted to them , and loafed and caught crabs the rest of it . We got back to camp again about eight or nine , and slept soundly . So much for our first fatigue expedition . The sand-bags which we filled are to construct a battery of one zoopounder gun with which to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing by night , I believe . The battery is to be built on a platform right in the middle of a swamp . It is an experiment ? but it is hoped that it will surprise the rebs if it does nothing more . The whole battery is to be only about fifty feet square . It is feared that the battery may be knocked to pieces by an enfilading fire from Fort Johnston . But we shall see what we shall see . There was some sort of a muss on James Island this morning , but we have heard no particulars . By the way , they hope to be able to send a shell into the city of Charleston with this one-gun battery , at least if the battery does not get knocked to pieces or does not sink in the swamp . There is some shelling going on now in the direction of Fort Wagner , coming I think from the fleet . What a terrible slaughter that was at Fort Wagner . Col. Shaw died nobly . He was the first man on the parapet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that the 54th stood its ground , when two white regiments broke . . . Hurrah for the negro troops . " YOU TALK OF COMPROMISE ? " The cause of the Union was becoming the cause of lovers of liberty everywhere ? of the German ' forty-eighters , for instance , who had settled here and were now the first to free Missouri from the slaveholders . But as the war dragged on , new difficulties arose for the Union and for Mr. Lincoln . There were draft riots in New York , there was incompetence and even indifference and neglect in the army and the government . And there was talk among some of the northern industrialists ( who had been most anxious to have this war for their own selfish interests ) that it was time to reach a " compromise " with the slaveholding planters // of the South now that their political control on the continent had been broken . The reply to these proposals was made by one of the many poor southern whites - the freeholders in Tennessee and North Carolina and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the beginning . The uncompromising reply was made by Andrew Johnson , Union governor of Tennessee now , and president to be : ... I am opposed to an aristocracy . I am for this government as it is ? and if it requires alteration , let it be amended according to the Constitution of the United States . I am opposed to an aristocracy of money , of banks , of railroads , or monopolies of any kind . I am opposed to a sort of brainless aristocracy resting upon decayed family reputation . While I say this , though it may seem somewhat para. , doxical ? I am in favor of an aristocracy . Yes , I am in favor of an aristocracy of virtue , of tallent , of intelligence , of merit , of worth . I am in favor of an aristocracy of labor . That which elevates the great mass of mankind is the aristocracy I am in favor of . Let each and every man , without regard to antecedents , rise and stand upon his own intrinsic worth and merit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it mattered not with me ? the question was whether he came according to the form of the law ! .. . I care not . . . whether it rises in the shape of banks , or tariffs , or monopolies of this or the other kind , or whether it comes in the shape of the institution of slavery ? I say , if they come in the way of the great car of state ? this free Government , in moving the car of state along ? banks , tariffs , monopolies , stock-jobbers , and slavery , and Negro-owners , must get out of the way ! . . . I am for the supremacy of the Constitution . I am for the enforcement of the laws . And , if in resisting the Constitution , and in enforcing the laws , slavery ? like any other institution ? gets in the way , it must get out of the way for the existence of the Government . . . Now I will ask in good faith ? if you settle this question by compromise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South ? If these traitors are restored to power . . . what is to become of them ? . . . If Southern men have sacrificed their property , have been murdered . . . are now scattered in the mountains fleeing from their tyranny , are you // going to compromise these Union men , and hand them over to traitors ? I suppose the humble individual who addresses you will be the first man suspended with a piece of hemp . Is this the reward that they are to receive at the hands of their Government ? If it is , it seems to me to be a poor reward for loyalty . Carry to that people protection . Again unfurl your Stars and Stripes ? and they will show you their allegiance to their government in acts and deeds that are unmistakable ! Go there now , and see what is their condition , claiming protection under the Government : Females are insulted , their children have been murdered , their sons and husbands chased into the mountains ? hunted and pursued like beasts of the forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the red men of the forest , who cut off their ears to show them as trophies . Is this the treatment they are to receive for their devotion ? Others are now lying in dungeons , filthy and loathsome ? and what response is there to their groans , and appeals for protection ? None , but the guarding of dungeon doors , and the clanking of chains that bind freemen 's limbs . And yet you talk of " compromise " ! Here it is men dare to be disloyal , where there is no danger . There , where there is danger ? they have the courage to be loyal . . . Here , in New York ? where all is bustle , where commerce , trade and manufacture are prosperous ? you scarcely realize the condition of things out there . You scarcely understand it . . . But go out there , and travel along the track of war : look at the devastated farms , consumed dwellings , the waste of new-made graves by thousands of your brave sons ? many of them with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Will you retreat ? and leave these men sleeping between a traitor flag ? Are you prepared , you citizens of New York , to let the grave of Washington , the founder of this great Republic , remain within the confines of treason and traitors ? Will you let the grave of Jefferson remain within their confines ? Will you let the grave of Jackson remain within their borders ? AS IF BLOWN AWAY If the war had been a short one , the South might have won ( it was better prepared at the start ) . But as the days stretched into hungry weeks , and the weeks into ragged months , the weakened South was further drained of its badly needed men and resources . Its ports were // blockaded . Its territory , cut first by the Appalachians , was beginning ' to swarm with rifle-toting damyankees , from Chattanooga down to New Orleans ( and Vicksburg under siege ) and getting ready to knife their way across the Confederacy 's middle , to Atlanta , to the sea . The South 's final hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war into northern territory . By July of 1863 , General Lee had taken his army into Pennsylvania ? where the crucial battle of the war was just getting underway now , near the town of Gettysburg : Friday , July 3 : ... From eleven A.M. to one P.M. there was a perfect lull ? each party apparently waiting to see what the other was about to do , and at what point the attack was to be made . At seven minutes past one P.M. the awful and portentous silence was broken . Probably not less than 150 guns on each side belched forth the missiles of death , producing such a continuous succession of crashing sounds as to make us feel g as if the very heavens had been rent asunder such as were never equalled by the most terrific thunderstorm ever witnessed by mortal man . The air was filled with lines of whizzing , screaming , bursting shells and solid shot . The enemy had placed his guns on the hills near the Bonaughtown road , near the York road , near the Harrisburg road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a point beyond Round Top , so as to subject our artillery on Cemetery hill to a circle of cross fires , and to enable him to dismount and destroy them . By this means he hoped to break our front center ? but in this he was not successful . During the day General Lee had reconnoitred our position from the College cupola . . . and had come to the conclusion that our left center was the weakest part of our lines . Anderson and McLaws had failed to turn our left flank on the previous evening . Ewell had most signally failed in the morning to take Culp 's hill and turn our right . And now some other point must be assailed ? that point was the position held by Hancock . When two-thirty P.M. came , it witnessed a determined effort on the part of the enemy to accomplish this result , so important and desirable to him . At this time , Pickett 's division of Longstreet 's corps , consisting of the brigades of Garnett , Kemper , and Armistead , was seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridge , just to the south of McMillan 's orchard , and to move in two long , dark massive lines , over the plain towards our left center . This division was supported on the left by Pettigrew 's brigade of Heath 's division , and on the right by Wright 's and Wilcox 's brigades of Anderson 's division . When this mass of men had moved over about one-third of the space between the two opposing lines , our batteries , placed in a grove near Bryan 's house , opened upon them , and threw shells and grape into the advancing column . Now for a few moments they seemed to hesitate ? then , with a terrific yell , they rushed forward . In a few moments a tremendous roar , proceeding from the simultaneous discharge from thousands of muskets and rifles , shook the earth . Then , in the portion of the line nearest us , a few , then more , and then still more Rebels ? in all to the number of about two hundred ? were seen moving backwards towards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last two or three men carrying a single battleflag , which they had saved from capture , and several officers on horseback , followed the fugitives . The wounded and dead were seen strewn amongst the grass and grain ; men with stretchers stealthily picking up and carrying the former to the rear ; and officers for a moment contemplating the scene with evident amazement , and riding rapidly towards the Seminary ridge . Our men having quietly waited until the Rebels came to the Emmittsburg road , poured a deadly fire into them , and cut them down like grass before the mower 's scythe . The rank and file had been made to believe that they were making this charge upon the Pennsylvania militia ? but their delusion was now broken , and in surprise they exclaimed : " The Army of the Potomac ! " But still they pressed onward . Our General Gibbon had ordered his men to fall back , to enable the artillery to use grape . The enemy came up to the cannon 's mouth , and were blown away or cut down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , " Boys , the enemy is ours ! " and his brigade rushed upon them and captured 800 prisoners . Stannard 's brigade took as many more . And still others were captured , swelling the number of prisoners . . . Fifteen stands of colors were taken . So sudden and complete was the slaughter and capture of nearly all of Pickett 's men , that one of his officers who fell wounded amongst the first on the Emmittsburg road , and who characterized the charge // as foolish and mad , said that when , in a few moments afterwards , he was enabled to rise and look about him , the whole division had disappeared ? as if blown away by the wind .. . UNKNOWN On the following day , Vicksburg , the last southern strongpoint on the Mississippi , fell to the army under Ulysses S. Grant ( another man headed for future fame and trouble ) . The exhausted South was beaten ? though the surrender at Appomatox was not made till almost two years later . The fratricidal war was over at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our land . It had cost nearly ten billion dollars ? far more than it would have taken to free the slaves by purchase from their owners ( if only their owners had been willing to accept Mr. Lincoln 's offer ) . But slaveholding , represented by a very small minority in the south , had been big business ? the biggest , in fact , before iron and steel-making began to develop ? and the slaveholders had stubbornly refused to consider letting go of their " property . " Ten billion dollars , and 600,000 lives ? and the pain that could not be measured , the desolate picture of the dead lying everywhere , seen as only a poet and hopeful saver of lives could see them : Seen as ' Walt Whitman saw them himself : During those three years in hospital , camp , or field , I made over six hundred visits or tours , and went , as I estimate , counting all , among from eighty thousand to a hundred thousand of the wounded and sick , as sustainer of spirit and body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visits varied from an hour or two , to all day or night ? for with dear or critical cases I generally watched all night .. . While I was with wounded and sick in thou- sands of cases from the New England States , and from New York , New Jersey , and Pennsylvania , and from Michigan , Wisconsin , Ohio , Indiana , Illinois , and all the Western States , I was with more or less from all the States , North and South , without exception . I was with many from the border states , especially from Maryland // and Virginia , and found , during those lurid years 1862-63 , far more Union southerners , especially Tennesseans , than is supposed . I was with many rebel officers and men among our wounded , and gave them always what I had , and tried to cheer them the same as any . I was among the army teamsters considerably , and , indeed , always found myself drawn to them . Among the black soldiers , wounded or sick , and in the contraband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhood , and did what I could for them . ... The dead in this war ? there they lie , strewing the fields and woods and valleys and battlefields of the south ? Virginia , the Peninsula ? Malvern hill and Fair Oaks ? the banks of the Chickahominy ? the terraces of Fredericksburg ? Antietam bridge ? the grisly ravines of Manassas ? the bloody promenade of the Wilderness ? the varieties of the strayed dead ( the estimate of the War Department is 25,000 national soldiers killed in battle and never buried at all , 5,000 drowned - 15,000 inhumed by strangers , or on the march in haste , in hitherto unfound localities ? 2,000 graves covered by sand and mud by Mississippi freshets , 3,000 carried away by caving-in of banks , etc . ) ? Gettysburg , the West , Southwest ? Vicksburg ?

( there , in secluded spots , their skeletons , bleached bones , tufts of hair , buttons , fragments of clothing , are occasionally found yet ) . Our young men , once so handsome and so joyous , taken from us ? the son from the mother , the husband from the wife , the dear friend from the dear friend . The clusters of camp graves , in Georgia , the Carolinas , and in Tennessee ? the single graves left in the woods or by the road-side ( hundreds , thousands , obliterated ) ? the corpses floated down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , floated down the upper Potomac , after the cavalry engagements , the pursuit of Lee , following Gettysburg ) ? some lie at the bottom of the sea ? the general million , and the special ceme-I // teries in almost all the States ? the infinite dead ? ( the land entire saturated , perfumed with their impalpable ashes ' exhalation in Nature 's chemistry distilled , and shall be so forever , in every future grain of wheat and ear of corn , and every flower that grows , and every breath we draw ) ? not only Northern leavening Southern soil ? thousands , aye tens of thousands , of Southerners , crumble today in Northern earth . And everywhere among these countless graves ? everywhere in the many soldier cemeteries of the nation . . . as at the time in the vast trenches , the depositories of slain , Northern and Southern , after the great battles ? not only where the scathing trail passed those years , but radiating since in all the peaceful quarters of the land ? we see , and ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in masses , to thousands or tens of thousands , the significant word : UNKNOWN . In some of the cemeteries nearly all the dead are unknown .. . The list of our known and our unknown dead in the war was long ? but it was not complete yet . There was another name to be added . The casualty occurred in the month of Appomatox ( when we shook hands as brothers again , and together broke what bread there was ) in April of ' 65 . The critically wounded man was taken across the street to a house facing the theater of action . He was but little known ? you might almost say he was one of the many unknown ? though he had held a place of some prominence , and he , more than anyone , had saved our Union from chaos and shame : Mr. Lincoln had done his job , and he was going back now to his Illinois soil . But where were we going ? Where were we headed ? and how would we ever get there ( tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was sharp as a berry , to help us on our way ? c.7orzrfeen PROMOTERS Let us give heed to the life of them who chase riches .. . DANTE *- " ' ? ? ? ) SOMETHING LIKE MEXICO The War Between Us was over , and our unity as a nation was something real at last . There was ( at least for the moment ) no longer any South or any North ? and more than just for the moment , there was no North or South in the deep and dangerous sense that these had existed before . There was only north , south , east , as the trains ran ( faster and smoother every year ) . And there was the West , opening up now to one and all ? miles and miles of it , as the pigeons flew , and as the ponies raced , carrying their riders to the new lands being claimed in the Indian Territory and farther still toward the western sun . Our pioneer sun was not setting yet . It was glowing red again ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pigeons raining down to feed our people trekking westward , over the bones of the slaughtered bison we called the buffalo ) . New pioneers were moving again , all over the West . And eventually they would flash the old frontier whip to make the rest of the nation aware that they were there to be reckoned with : the Mormons ' Utah and the miners ' Nevada , the lands of the Idaho , the soil of the Oregon , the future states of Wyoming and Washington , rich Montana and fabulous California . Yes , these and others ( Colorado , New Mexico , and finally Arizona ) would , in time , crack their frontier whips to warn the rest of the nation that neither the people nor their political parties could 168 // think or act without their consent or their considered disagreement . That would come in time : the lands west of the Plains , west of the Rockies , west of the Great Divide ( west with the sun that sets only to rise again over new pioneers ) would become states , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the immediate present , the opening West did not particularly matter , any more than the old North or South mattered now . We were together again , whole ? and what concerned us , above all else , was our present and our future as a whole people . If only we could have gone on , confidently , in that spirit , from that very point ? the point where our main principles and purposes had merged with the unifying ideas bequeathed by old Abe Lincoln ! If only we could have let that dearly won awareness of our wholeness as a nation and a people become our new starting point for the future ! ( If only a frog had wings , they said in North Carolina , it would n't have been bumping the earth all these years . ) But there were other forces at work , more determined than the force of our own national awakening , and these were destined to shape our future for the next century : They were redividing us already , even in the rose-dawn of our genuine national birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and West , North and South . And that was n't all . They were drawing new lines up and down and across , and driving great steel wedges down to keep those lines fixed ( forevermore , many of them hoped ) . For they were the new dominant forces long pent up and now emerging fast from our rising industrial system : They were new science and technology as well as industry and trade . They were big business , pyramiding upward , and high finance , spiralling still higher . They were the new factors , soon ( sooner than most people realized ) to become formula , which was already being tried and tested for effectiveness . It was a new equation for power ? power over nature , as well as over man , but above all , over society ? power over the whole social body of man . The men who stood for the new formula ? well-to-do businessmen , financiers , some generals and heroes of our recent war , and even a swindler or two who made no pretense of operating within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and laissez faire ( every man for // himself , and the devil take the hindmost , that meant ) and even antislavery , in their lapels . But the factors becoming formula which they stood for had quite another meaning . And its first major proving ground was the devastated and impoverished South ( the lines were being drawn again , sharper and deeper , and newer , more sinister lines alongside the old ones ) . Here was the ideal prey for the northern hawks of big business and bigger finance . Here was the South , with plenty of land and an abundance of resources with which to clothe itself , to gain its food , to win its way to its own industrialization and its own self-suffiiciency ( and its own self-confidence ) . Who would work that land , and who would build those industries , now that the main available hand of labor , the hand of the Negro laborer , had to be hired and paid with wages , had to be trained to become the hand of the skilled workman of tomorrow ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new social foundation resting squarely and simply on the principle of free and decently paid labor . This was what it needed ? but what it got was something else . It got a fanfare of talk and regulations ostensibly aimed at " reconstruction . " It got a nightmare of carpetbaggers and vehement advocates ( some sincere , others pretending , still others not even pretending ) of full civil rights for the Negro ( little if anything was said , however , of guaranteeing him and his children a fair wage , schools and colleges , and hospitals and libraries ) . And inevitably the South also got the Ku Klux Klan resistance , and a new drawing of lines between Negro and white , sharper and more threatening than they had ever been before . What the South needed was a standard of free labor that would gradually transform the South 's agrarian economy and bring it into the whole nation 's expanding industrial life on an equal and genuinely free basis . The problem was clear to the keen mind and the simple , fighting heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this country as a German immigrant , one of the liberal ' forty-eighters . He had fought to save the Union ? he had risen to the rank of major-general , and he was destined for many bigger things to come . He could see the new danger now , as early as 1865 , the year of Appomattox , when the principles for which the war had just been fought were already being repudiated in new ways , sometimes openly , sometimes wearing a false disguise . // Some of the planters with whom I had occasion to converse expressed their determination to adopt the course which best accords with the spirit of free labor : to make the Negro work by offering him fair inducements , to stimulate his ambition , and to extend to him those means of intellectual and moral improvement which are best calculated to make him an intelligent , reliable and effi cient free laborer and a good and useful citizen . Those who expressed such ideas were almost invariably professed Union men , and far above the average in point of mental ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secessionists also manifesting a willingness to give the free-labor experiment a fair trial . I can represent the sentiments of this small class in no better way than by quoting the language used by an Alabama judge in a conversation with me : " I am one of the most thoroughly whipped men in the South .. . I am a genuine old secessionist , and I believe now , as I always did , we had the constitutional right to secede . But the war has settled that matter , and it is all over now . As to this thing of free Negro labor , I do not believe in it , but I will give it a fair trial . I have a plantation and am going to make contracts with my hands , and then I want a real Yankee to run the machine for me ; not one of your New Yorkers or Pennsylvanians , but the genuine article from Massachusetts or Vermont ? one who can not only farm , but sing psalms and pray , and teach school : a real abolitionist , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it . If he does not succeed , I shall consider it proof conclusive that you are wrong and I am right . " I regret to say that views and intentions so reasonable I found confined to a small minority . Aside from the assumption that the Negro will not work without physical compulsion , there appears to be another popular notion prevalent in the South , which stands as no less serious an obstacle in the way of a successful solution of the problem . It is that the Negro exists for the special object of raising cotton , rice and sugar for the whites , and that it is illegitimate for him to indulge , like other people , in the pursuit of his own happiness in his own way . Although it is admitted that he has ceased to be the property of a master , it is not admitted that he has a right to become his own master . As Colonel Thomas , assistant commissioner of the Freedmen 's Bureau in Mississippi , in a letter addressed to me , very pungently expresses it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural right , and // however much they may admit that the relations of masters and slaves have been destroyed by the war and by the president 's emancipation proclamation , they still have an ingrained feeling that the blacks at large belong to the whites at large , and whenever opportunity serves , they treat the colored people just as their profit , caprice or passion may dictate . An ingrained feeling like this is apt to bring forth that sort of class legislation which produces laws to govern one class with no other view than to benefit another . This tendency can be distinctly traced in the various schemes for regulating labor which here and there see the light . " Immediately after the emancipation of the slaves , when the general confusion was most perplexing , the prevalent desire among the whites seemed to be , if they could not retain their Negroes as slaves , to get rid of them entirely . Wild speculations were indulged in , how to remove the colored population at once and to import white laborers to fill its place ; how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc . Even at the present moment the removal of the freedmen is strongly advocated by those who have the traditional horror of a free Negro , and in some sections ? especially where the soil is more adapted to the cultivation of cereals than the raising of the staples ? planters appear to be inclined to drive the Negroes away , at least from their plantations . I was informed by a prominent South Carolinian . . . that the planters in certain localities in the northwestern part of the State had been on the point of doing so , but better counsel had been made to prevail upon them . And Colonel Robinson , 97th United States Colored Infantry , who had been sent out to several counties in southern Alabama to administer the amnesty oath , reported a general disposition among the planters of that region to " set the colored people who had cultivated their crops during the summer adrift as soon as the crops would be secured , and not to permit the Negro to remain upon any footing of equality with the white man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Negroes from the plantations was undoubtedly confined to a few districts . And as far as the scheme of wholesale deportation is concerned , practical men became aware , that if they wanted to have any labor done , it would have been bad policy to move away the laborers they now have before others were there to fill their places . All these devices promising at best only distant relief , and free Negro labor being the only thing in immediate prospect , many ingenious heads set about to solve the problem ? how to make free labor compulsory by permanent regulations . // Shortly after the close of the war some South Carolina planters tried to solve this problem by introducing into the contracts provisions leaving only a small share of the crops to the freedmen , subject to all sorts of constructive charges , and then binding them to work off the indebtedness they might incur . It being to a great extent in the power of the employer to keep the laborer in debt to him , the employer might thus obtain a permanent hold upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system of peonage existing in Mexico .. . A TIME OF TRIUMPH Slavery was gone in name - but peonage was among us in fact . The former feudal empire of the South was already becoming the first colony of the triumphant and multiplying industrial power of the North . And there was little that fighting liberals like Carl Schurz could do about that , or about clearing up the policy of general confusion being pursued by President Andrew Johnson . There was even less they could do about reforming the industrial groups of the North , whose men were in control of Congress and who were clearly interested in keeping the South in a state of economic and political subjection as a source of cheap raw materials and a market for their manufactured goods . One of the wartime Union heroes was soon to become the chief symbol of this newer policy of economic subjection . He was Ulysses S. Grant himself , raised to the presidency in ' 68 , and hemmed in on almost every side by the men of real power who were getting ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses of our big cities , but from the White House itself . It was a time of triumph for the money-men . But it was also a time of triumph for the United States as a nation . We had fought our way to unity , and we had won the respect and admiration of the world again . The efforts of England to split us , by encouraging and even aiding the Confederacy , had failed , just as the attempts of Napoleon III of France and his Austrian puppet , Maximilian , to set up a European-controlled monarchy across our southern border , in Mexico , were also meeting defeat ( we were invoking the Monroe Doctrine again , which had first kept European despotism and // British toryism from overrunning this hemisphere more than two score years before ) . Yes , we were respected and admired again even while we were being laughed at : Immediately the music burst forth into a veritable triumphant march . Faces cleared or broke into smiles . People fell back , leaving a broad aisle to the upper end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with draped flags and gilded chairs for the official dignitaries and his Royal Highness . The Prince offered his arm to Mrs. Grant , and the Mrs. Church 's Account of arm of General Grant was taken by Lady Thornton . The Secretary of State , Mr. I-Iamilton Fish , was assigned to the beautiful Mrs. Governor Sprague of Rhode Island , daughter of the Chief Justice , Salmon P. Chase , who gave his arm to Mrs. Hamilton Fish . They passed along in stately fashion , and imposing array , until , near the dais , a court quadrille was formed , which they proceeded to dance with exceeding difficulty and many wanderings afield . The assemblage looked on , much entertained , enjoying their efforts to acquit themselves creditably . But for the ready wit of Mrs. Sprague , her youthful knowledge of how a quadrille should go , and her matchless skill in steering things generally , I fear the distinguished dignitaries would have made a hopeless mess of it . Prince Arthur twice broke into an irresistible smile and looked as if he longed to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought up to assume any such initiative . Secretary Fish always turned the wrong way , but somehow was rescued just as the crucial moment . However , they went through it beautifully and seemed to enjoy the unwonted pastime ? though evidently relieved when seated comfortably on the dais and the general dancing began . Just before the cotillion , as the last square dance of the evening was forming , I found myself standing beside Admiral Farragut for my partner . He had seized my hand and led me forward in his gay animated way : " Come , you are to dance this set with me . General Sherman is to be our vis-a-vis , with Miss Lee " ? naming one of my good friends . Soon they stood opposite . Then came rollicking General Phil Sheridan , with another young girl , and then Admiral Porter ? " Dave Porter , " as they called him , with still another to complete the set . // Then began altogether the most charming , memorable dance of my life . These heroes were all " in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contagion .. . Admiral Farragut was noted . . . for marvelous agility and accomplishment in dancing and knowledge of all manner of wonderful steps . Every now and then he would spring from the floor , carried away by the mere impulse of rhythmical movement . Then his feet would flash to and fro and twitter in the air with inconceivable rapidity , in alighting , only to bound up again . Some man standing near cried out , " Brava , Admiral ! That is the best pigeon wing I ever saw ! " The Admiral laughed back , " Oh , that 's nothing ? a mere preliminary ! You know it would n't do to let go here . It would shock the Prince and my Lady Thornton . " He scowled at the thought ? and then we all laughed . Little cared we for shocking any one . We were all in the air ? buoyant and uplifted with youth and happiness . General Sheridan was a bit rough and almost whirled the girls off their feet , when it came to " swinging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jollity and exuberant enjoyment which possessed us all . It seemed to open up an inner vision of these men of fame .. . The dance became almost a romp .. . THE RAILWAYS ARE PANTING The dance was becoming a romp , and the men who were leading it ( and playing the tune ? with everybody 's money , including the United States Treasury 's ) could scarcely be seen at all . They were the big promoters like Jim Fisk and Jay Gould , Daniel Drew and Commodore Vanderbilt , and that other lay whose name was Cooke . They could sell anything to anyone who stopped to Iisten ? anything from the Grand Canyon to the Erie Canal , or any one of the new railroads being built ( Union Pacific , for instance , with everybody 's money and everybody 's land , especially the nation 's , and a lot of people 's sweat and even blood ) . They were the new financial barons , coming up the hard way ( or was it the sly way ? ) . The Vanderbilt domain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kingdom . These were now the real wielders of // power within our republic ? and they were " taking care " of the politicians in Washington through the Sturm and Drang , the storm and the drive , of exposed swindle and publicized scandal that began even before the first of our periodic waves of economic depression and financial panic struck the nation in ' 69 . There was that black Friday in the fall of ' 69 when Fisk and Gould nearly cornered the gold market , and thousands of investors and speculators failed . And then , out of the blue of our " business as usual , " came the crash of ' 73 . But still the big promoting went on . The spiel of the new medicine men continued to weave its spell of the prospect of sudden and insuperable riches , in the secret conference room or the public hall , in the sedate advertisement ? or in the Northern Pacific Railroad 's lavish promotion of the North Dakota frontier as a paradise on earth : From the paradisean valley of the Northern Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black Hills , from the romantic confines of the Yellowstone to the horizon-fenced corn-fields and cowpastures of Yankton and Niobrara , it is a land fair enough to tempt the angels in their flight to pause and wonder whether a new and better Eden has not been formed and roofed with sapphire skies . Its climate unites all that is bracing and inspiring . It is a climate of health and vigor , nerving to work and the very audacity of dash . No more robust tribes of Indians than those of Dakota ever chased the huge buffalo over the plains , or bearded the grizzly monarch of the mountains in his lair . People who have come here to die of bronchitis and consumption have lived to become glowing embodiments of soundness and strength ? with throats like firemen 's trumpets , and lungs like blacksmiths ' bellows . The howling blizzards , of which outside worldings delight to prate ; blow all miasma and contagion from Dakota 's favored plains and valleys , and breathe new life into dilapidated nostrils . The enfeebled parson from down east , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the bald pates of his dozing elders and deacons , is soon able , not only to keep his hearers awake , but almost to arouse ? as with a forty-donkey-power bugle blast ? the sheeted sleepers in the churchyard . And the frail , ethereal housewife , whose tremulous whisTHE // pers were unheard beyond the ruffles on her muslin cap , can scold her husband or her boys in steam-calliope soprano notes that resound a square away .. . But seven years ago , Custer and his battalion were massacred by the Sioux just beyond the western border of the territory , and wild beasts and wilder men roamed undisturbed over nearly all this grand domain . fn that brief period ( scarcely a clock-tick in the world 's long march of ages ) magical cities like Fargo and Deadwood , Bismarck , Jamestown , Grand Forks , Sioux Falls , Huron , and a hundred other places that might be named , have sprung from the wild prairie grass full panoplied with all the armory of metropolitan life . Electric lights send forth their radiance where but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palace cars fly thundering and shrieking across golden-harvest-burdened plains , where but a few moons ago the buffalo pastured and the gray wolf trailed his prey . Churches , schools , banks and daily papers are sown broadcast all over the feeding-places of yesterday 's antelope and red deer . The skulls and bones of the scarce departed denizens of the wilderness are still strewn in the streets of cities that patronize lectures and operas , and boast of their metropolitan culture and styles . The story of Jonah 's gourd and the Oriental extravaganza of Aladdin 's miracle-working lamp have dwindled to commonplace realities which every Dakota boy and girl of five or ten years has seen surpassed . Every day and every hour is adding to the wonders . New towns and cities spring up like toadstools in a night . Railroads are being pushed in all directions .. . Throngs of people are pouring in from every land beneath the skies : fat-pocketed capitalists looking for bonanzas , strong-armed laborers seeking homes and work , sharp-witted adventurers looking for a chance to fleece somebody , played-out political hacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands into the public cribs ? all classes , ages , sexes , and conditions coming , flocking , swarming to Dakota 's fields of golden grain , her mines of golden ore , and her exhaustless stores of golden promise . Steamers are loaded down to the guards , and all the railways are panting under their burdens of home and fortune hunters . // " OUR DEADLIEST FOE " While the big money was being made by the big promoters and their political hacks in Washington ( congressmen and senators , and men and women in the White House , close to the presidents themselves ) the South was being driven deeper and deeper into the status of a subject , agrarian colony : " Our strong ground , " wrote the future president of the United States , Rutherford G. Hayes , in 1876 , " is the dread of a solid south , rebel rule , etc. , etc . . . . Make these topics prominent in your speeches .

The double-dealing went on ? but it could not keep " hard times " away . It could no longer hide the hollowness of the new financial power on which our rising industrial system had come to depend . It could not even save our biggest financiers from bankruptcy ? to say nothing of the thousands upon thousands of common folk who went down with them . Not even the almost mythical Jay Cooke himself was exempt from the scourge he had helped to bring upon us . Not even Cooke 's own secluded palace and grounds were free any longer from the thunder of the auctioneer 's hammer : All that large and very elegant country seat known as Ogontz . . . situate on Chelten Hills , in Montgomery County , Pennsylvania . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mansion , four stories high , with two towers , each five stories , built of very handsome granite stone ? from the quarries in the neighborhood and from Ouincv , Massa chusetts ? in the most substantial and costly manner , finished in hard woods , tin roof .

Here was our American Inferno at last ? in South Dakota or Minnesota , in Arkansas or Iowa , State Street in Chicago as Wall Street in New York ? the Pit without end , rising up to engulf our precepts of freedom , and our aims of brotherhood . We were threatened by this new and unforeseen kind of deluge . We were threatened with disaster ? yet we felt helpless to cope with the threat . But a new and unforeseen power of another kind was already coming to our aid . It was a power hard to recognize because it wore everyday work clothes ( as a carpenter had done , two thousand years or so before , among the high hills of Galilee ) . The saving arm of American labor was rising out of the climbing waves of depression and panic surrounding us , was reaching toward us ( not yet sure , but sinewy and strong ) to try to lift us from the flood . HANDS And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I shall climb out of the Pit , but not by the muscles of my body shall I climb out . " JACK LONDON UPON A MIGHTY CURRENT In the midst of the new economic and social and spiritual darkness around us , there were already glimmers of hope ? felt rather than seen at first ( as the presence of a fire can often be sensed before it becomes visible ) . There was hope in the very momentum of the various movements for greater human freedom that were springing into life as the aftermath of the war we had fought among ourselves . In spite of the greater subjection of our new needs as a freer people to the will of the big moneyed groups , there was a sense of awakening among us , too . There was a feeling of waking in a larger room where the ceiling was higher and the windows were taller ( and the morning Iight was coming through the gauze curtains ) . Not all the people were aware of it ? and some were more aware than others : A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now , to the changing beat and meaning of our lives than many others who were born to freedom . A man like Frederick Douglass , born into slavery but risen to struggle and renown , might be ( and was ) far more keenly alert to the changed and changing norms of our American society than many men who were born to privilege ? including his own ex-master , of Maryland 's eastern shore . The Honorable Frederick Douglass was his own master now ? he was Marshal of the District of Columbia and he would be our future Minister to Haiti ; he was an advocate of greater rights for 181 // women and all mankind , and he was also an advocate of greater compassion for those who had held us in cruel bondage yesterday and who now lay dying : My return ... in peace to this place and among the same people , was strange enough in itself . But that I should , when there , be formally invited by Captain Thomas Auld , then over eighty years old , to come to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a friendly talk over our past relations , was a fact still more strange ? and one which , until its occurrence , I could never have thought possible . To me Captain Auld had sustained the relation of master ? a relation which I had held in extremest abhorrence , and which for forty years I had denounced in all bitterness of spirit and fierceness of speech . He had struck down my personality , had subjected me to his will , made property of my body and soul , reduced me to a chattel , hired me out to a noted slave breaker to be worked like a beast and flogged into submission , taken my hard earnings , sent me to prison , offered me for sale , broken up my Sunday-school , forbidden me to teach my fellow-slaves to read on pain of nine and thirty lashes on my bare back , and had ? without any apparent disturbance of his conscience ? sold my body to his brother Hugh and pocketed the price of my flesh and blood . I , on my part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of England , holding up this conduct of his , in common with that of other slaveholders , to the reprobation of all men who would listen to my words . I had by my writings made his name and his deeds familiar to the world in four different languages . Yet here we were , after four decades , once more face to face ? he on his bed , aged and tremulous , drawing near the sunset of life , and I. his former slave , United States Marshal of the District of Columbia , holding his hand and , in friendly conversation with him in a sort of final settlement of past differences preparatory to his stepping into his grave , where all distinctions are at an end , and where the great and the small , the slave and the master , are reduced to the same level . Had I been asked in the days of slavery to visit this man I should have regarded the invitation as one to put fetters on my ankles and handcuffs on my wrists . It would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whip . I had no business with this man under the old regime but to keep out of his way . But now that slavery was destroyed , and the slave and the master stood upon equal ground , I was not only willing to meet him , but was very glad to do so . The conditions were favorable for remembrance of all his good deeds , and generous extenuation of all his evil ones . He was to me no longer a slaveholder either in fact or in spirit , and I regarded him as I did myself ? a victim of the circumstances of birth , education , law , and custom . Our courses had been determined for us , not by us . We had both been flung , by powers that did not ask our consent , upon a mighty current of life , which we could neither resist nor control . By this current he was a master , and I a slave . But now our lives were verging towards a point where differences disappear , where even the constancy of hate breaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selfishness vanish before the brightness of infinite light . At such a time , and in such a place , when a man is about closing his eyes on this world and ready to step into the eternal unknown , no word of reproach or bitterness should reach him or fall from his lips ? and on this occasion there was to this rule no transgression on either side . ... On reaching the house I was met by Mr. William H. Bruff , a son-in-law of Captain Auld , and Mrs. Louisa Bruff , his daughter , and was conducted by them immediately to the bedroom of Captain Auld . We addressed each other simultaneously , he calling me " Marshal Douglass , " and I , as I had always called him , " Captain Auld . " Hearing myself called by him " Marshal Douglass , " I instantly broke up the formal nature of the meeting by saying , " not Marshal , but Frederick to you as formerly . " We shook hands cordially , and in the act of doing so , he , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus afflicted will do when excited by any deep emotion . The sight of him , the changes which time had wrought in him , his tremulous hands constantly in motion , and all the circumstances of his condition affected me deeply , and for a time choked my voice and made me speechless . We both , however , got the better of our feelings , and conversed freely about the past . Though broken by age and palsy , the mind of Captain Auld was remarkably clear and strong . After he had become composed I asked him what he thought of my conduct in running away and going to the north . He hesitated a moment as if to properly formulate his reply , // and said : " Frederick , I always knew you were too smart to be a slave , and had I been in your place , I should have done as you did . " I said , " Captain Auld , I am glad to hear you say this . I did not run away from you , but from slavery ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearts again . Not because our Iot , in general , was better than before ( it was often worse ) , but because we began to perceive the miraculous fruits of our labor in greater quantity and wider diversity than had ever been thought possible ? and we not only wanted more of those fruits , but we also wanted to understand why we were being deprived of them . We could see the cities we had built , now ? the buildings growing taller , the spacious dwellings , the streets widening into avenues as the open space between the cities began to shrink and narrow into nothing . And all , everything ? cities and houses , factories and schools , playgrounds and libraries , department stores and colleges ? linked and intertwined by the pipe and subterranean cables we had laid , by the wires we had strung on the poles we had raised , by the tracks we had spiked to the ground , and the tracks we had lifted and set like a circling crown in the city sky ( in Chicago 's Loop and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , even on the farm , where the chores never seemed to end for men and women alike ( and often children , too ) , we were beginning to breed a new kind of hope ( not just another calf or a better plow , though these meant a lot , nor even just a tiny addition to the family that would someday mean an extra pair of strong working hands ) . We were hungry for something new ? not merely a gingham apron or a real , manufactured , coal-burning stove ( though they were mighty fine to have ) . We needed something more , now : We were in need of new ideas and new ways of thinking ( maybe not a great many of us , but enough of us to matter ) . We wanted to " let go " more , too ? and we had to know more about our feelings . We were beginning to look for the strange and the unknown . We were looking for them in the colors and the sounds around us , in the smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were able to buy or to borrow ( and in those we had simply heard tell of ) . // All the season , from the coming in of the first fruits until the making of mince-meat at Christmas time , I put up canned goods for future use ; gather in many bushels of field beans and the other crops usually raised on the farm ; make sour-kraut , ketchup , pickles , etc . . . . Any bright morning in the latter part of May I am out of bed at four o'clock ; next , after I have dressed and combed my The Life Story of an hair , I start a fire in the kitchen stove , and Illinois Farmer 's Wife while the stove is getting hot I go to my flower garden and gather a choice , half-blown rose and a spray of bride 's wreath , and arrange them in my hair , and sweep the floors and then cook breakfast . While the other members of the family are eating breakfast I strain away the morning 's milk ( for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fill my husband 's dinner-pail  --  for he will go to work on our other farm for the day . By this time it is half-past five o'clock , my husband is gone to his work , and the stock loudly pleading to be turned into the pastures . The younger cattle , a half-dozen steers , are left in the pasture at night , and I now drive the two cows , a half-quarter mile and turn them in with the others , come back , and then there 's a horse in the barn that belongs in a field where there is no water , which I take to a spring quite a distance from the barn ; bring it back and turn it into a field with the sheep ? a dozen in number ? which are housed at night . The young calves are then turned out into the warm sunshine , and the stock hogs , which are kept in a pen , are clamoring for feed , and I carry a pailful of swill to them , and hasten to the house and turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . And it is , perhaps , 6:3o A.M. I have not eaten breakfast yet , but that can wait . I make the beds next and straighten things up in the living room , for I dislike to have the early morning caller find my house topsy-turvy . When this is done I go to the kitchen , which also serves as a dining-room , and uncover the table , and take a mouthful of food occasionally as I pass to and fro at my work until my appetite is appeased . By the time the work is done in the kitchen it is about 7:15 A.M. , and the cool morning hours have flown , and no hoeing done in the garden yet , and the children 's toilet has to be attended to and churning has to be done . Finally the children are washed and churning done , and it is eight o'clock , and the sun getting hot ? but no matter , weeds die quickly // when cut down in the heat of the day . And I use the hoe to a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We come in , and I comb my hair , and put fresh flowers in it , and eat a cold dinner , put out feed and water for the chickens ; set a hen , perhaps , sweep the floors again , sit down and rest , and read a few moments . And it is nearly one o'clock . And I sweep the door yard while I am waiting for the clock to strike the hour . I make and sow a flower bed , dig around some shrubbery , and go back to the garden to hoe until time to do the chores at night . But ere long some hogs come up to the back gate , through the wheatfield , and when I go to see what is wrong I find that the cows have torn the fence down , and they , too , are in the wheat field . With much difficulty I get them back into their own domain and repair the fence . I hoe in the garden till four o'clock . Then I go into the house and get supper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all ready it is set aside , and I pull a few hundred plants of tomato , sweet potato or cabbage for transplanting , set them in a cool , moist place where they will not wilt , and I then go after the horse , water him , and put him in the barn ; call the sheep and house them , and go after the cows and milk them , feed the hogs , put down hay for three horses , and put oats and corn in their troughs , and set those plants and come in and fasten up the chickens . And it is dark . By this time it is eight o'clock P.M. , my husband has come home , and we are eating supper . When we are through eating I make the beds ready , and the children and their father go to bed , and I wash the dishes and get things in shape to get breakfast quickly next morning . It is now about nine o'clock P.M. , and after a short prayer I retire for the night .. . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apples , pumpkins , and such things as would damage by being frozen , and gather in the various kinds of nuts which grow in our woods to eat during the long , cold winter .. . I must admit that there is very little time for the higher life for myself ? but my soul cries out for it , and my heart is not in my homely duties . They are done in a mechanical abstracted way , not worthy of a woman of high ambitions ? but my ambitions are along other lines . I do not mean to say that I have no ambition to do my work well , and to be a model housekeeper , for I would scorn to slight my work intentionally . It is just this way : there are so many outdoor duties that the time left for household duties is limited that I must rush through // them , with a view to getting each one done in the shortest possible time , in order to get as many things accomplished as possible ? for there is never time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AU the time that I have been going about this work I have been thinking of things I have read , of things I have on hand to read when I can get time , and of other things which I have a desire to read ... . In the short winter days I just get the cooking and house-straightening done , in addition to looking after the stock and poultry , and make a garment occasionally , and wash and iron the clothes . All the other work is done after night by lamp light . And when the work for the day is over , or at least the most pressing part of it , and the family are all asleep and no one to forbid it , I spend a few hours writing or reading . THE LAMP THAT IS LIGHTED In the country or in the city , life was hardly a bed of roses ? where most of the people were concerned . Yet , to the working folk of other countries , America was still the poor man 's Eden ( more than an Eden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get to the bottom of things without running too great a risk of being booted out ) . More of us ? thousands that would become millions before the century turned ? were migrating now from the dying worlds of Europe and Asia : from hungry Italy and from plague-torn China , from Ireland ruined by famine , and from Russia ruled by the czars ' oppression . We were coming from the fields and the fjords of Scandinavia , from the mines of Wales , from the ports of the Adriatic , the Aegean , and the old Mediterranean . We were heading westward from Poland , children and grownups , Christians and Jews , fleeing from persecution , fleeing from poverty and want and disease and neglect , from fear , from death : My mother was a tall , handsome , dark complexioned woman with red cheeks , large brown eves and a great quantity of jet black , wavy hair ... . She kept a little grocer 's shop in the little village where we lived at first . ' flint was in Poland . .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very dark place that smelt dreadfully . There were hundreds of other people packed in with us ? // men , women and children ? and almost all of them were sick . It took us twelve days to cross the sea , and we thought we should die . But at last the voyage was over ? and we came up and saw the beautiful bay and the big woman with the spikes on her head and the lamp that is lighted at night in her hand ... . Aunt Fanny had always been anxious for me to get an education , as I did not know how to read or write , and she thought that was wrong . Schools are different in Poland from what they are in this country , and I was always too busy to learn to read and write . So when mother died I thought I would try to learn a trade and then I could go to school at night and learn to speak the English language well . So I went to work in Allen street , in Manhattan , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was new at the work and the foreman scolded me a great deal . " Now , then , " he would say , " this place is not for you to be looking around in . Attend to your work . That is what you have to do . " I did not know at first that . you must not look around and talk , and I made many mistakes with the sewing ? so that I was often called a " stupid animal . " But I made four dollars a week by working six days in the week . For there are two Sabbaths here ? our own Sabbath , that comes on a Saturday , and the Christian Sabbath that comes on Sunday . It is against our law to work on our own Sabbath , so we work on their Sabbath . In Poland I and my father and mother used to go to the synagogue on the Sabbath , but here the women do n't go to the synagogue much ... . They are shut up working hard all the week long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long in bed ? and afterward they must go out where they can breathe the air ... . I lived at this time with a girl named Ella , who worked in the same factory and made five dollars a week . We had the room all to ourselves , paying $1.5o a week for it , and doing light housekeeping . It was in Allen street , and the window looked out of the back ? which was good because there was an elevated railroad in the front part of the house ( and in summer time a great deal of dust and dirt came in at the front windows ) . We were on the fourth story and could see all that was going on in the back rooms of the houses behind us . And early in the morning the sun used to come in our window . // THE WILD IRISHMAN Out of the maelstrom of industrial life , out of the rigors of industrial labor ? out of the fires of the mine and the factory , and out of the fires of the new social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pilgrims ' fire had come , two centuries and a half before ) ? a new kind of man , and a new kind of woman , were being born : They were the American workmen . They were the new pioneers , they were the frontiersmen now ? though they owned almost nothing but their jobs ( except maybe a prayer book and the opportunity of living on the installment plan ) . He wore overalls for buckskin , and she wore her hair uncovered where before she had used the sun bonnet . They spoke in many accents : Southern AppaIachian and broad New England , western lingo and Pennsylvania dialect , and a hundred others , and a hundred more ? Chinese and German , Italian and Russian , Norwegian and Yiddish , Japanese and Portuguese , and Galway Irish . They were quiet and hard-working by nature , but they were hellers when aroused ? as Ben Hanford , who was a union leader himself and a future vice-presidential candidate on the new Socialist ticket , well knew , and was able to relate : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ? Well , then , I 'll get another . If I ca n't get another , I 'll go without . " That was the way the Wild Irishman talked when he was told that he would be fired for his activity in union matters . He kept right on organizing unions . Strange to say , his bosses did not fire him . As the Wild Irishman told me when I saw him : " If I lost me job , I 'd have all the more time to organize the men . " I looked forward with interest to meeting the Wild Irishman . At last I went to his cabin ? a company " house " in a mining camp near Wilkes-Barre , Pa . I introduced myself , and he invited me into the back yard , the afternoon being warm . His wife joined us . Notwithstanding all I had heard about him , the Wild Irishman took // me by surprise . He was a man well along into the sixties ? what with the diseases and accidents incident to his trade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun anthracite mining in the old days when something like decent wages were paid . I never saw such a remarkable looking man in my life : His scalp was scarred , and his face bore the blue and black-marks of powder explosions . For the rest , it seemed as though every bone in his body was either fractured or dislocated . During his many years in and about the mines he had met with every sort of accident . Premature and delayed explosions . Fire damp . Pillars giving way . Roof falling . Pumping machinery out of order and flooding of the mine . Cables breaking . Every sort of mining accident had happened to him one or more times . Besides , he had gone looking for accidents ? had both legs broken while digging to rescue some comrades when the " hill fell on them . " Such a twisted , battered-up man I never saw . But somehow nothing had ever been able to " get him " in a vital spot . And regardless of the fractures , dislocations and scar-tissue scattered through and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome man ? and a strong man , notwithstanding his years . Heart and lungs as sound as ever . And an eye like an eagle . Crippled and disfigured in half a hundred places , grizzled , and gray , and weather beaten ? but strong . He sat there on a bench in the little back yard , telling the story of the great strike and the causes of it . And his good wife sat by , the most beautiful old woman I have ever seen . Hair whiter than snow . A fine oval face . Wrinkled . Deep lines written there when her son was killed in the tipple . Other lines that told of want , then and in days gone by . And other lines that told of worry , and of the long sleepless nights and days while she was watching and nursing the Wild Irishman . And yet that seamed old face was cheerful . She was one of those women that made you feel better if she merely nodded to you . Her " good morning " would cheer you up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tale of the strike , what caused it and what it was for . He told me the low wages the men made ? when they had work . I-le told of the short time , the lay-offs , and the shut-downs . He told how the company stores robbed the men , charging them two and three prices for the staple necessaries of life ; how the then were in debt , and were compelled to trade at the company stores ? those who were not in debt being laid off . He told how the company charged the miner two and three times the market price for powder . He told how // the company sold coal on a basis of 2,240 pounds to the ton , and how they compelled the miner to give them a ton of 3,000 pounds or more . He told how the men were docked for trifling things , and how the companies fought against a check weighman ? a measure with no purpose except to insure the honest weighing of the coal . He told of the company doctor , the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robbery and extortion practised by the coal barons . As he concluded his story of the conditions under which he had labored for so many years , the Wild Irishman stood up . He raised one hand as if taking an oath and said : " And I and the boys will never go back under the old conditions ? never . I 'll ate the dirt in the street first ! " Then the white-haired old wife spoke up . Said she : " Yes , and I 'll cook it for him ! " Here were the new American pioneers emerging from our growing industrial strife . Their hands of labor had become the most skilled and proficient hands on earth . And now they were beginning to reveal themselves also as able and even eloquent instruments ( wielded by such giants of socialism as presidential candidate Eugene V. Debs ) to argue the cause of greater justice for the working man . They were more than that , too : Through the panic of ' 73 and the railroad strike of ' 77 , through the protests over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ' 93 , and through a score of other trials involving union organization in the face of intimidation and terror and death , the hands of American labor had also proved ? by organization , by bargaining , and by the use of the strike when necessary ? their courage and their resolution to challenge the sway of the country 's financial oligarchy and its relentless drive toward enormous profits and absolute power . They had proved their ability and their determination to challenge the social ruthlessness and the moral recklessness of a pattern of power that was hurling our lives into the Pit of uselessness ? the American Inferno that was being dug by the recurrent cycle of overproduction , depression , and unemployment . But in spite of labor 's courage , in spite of its martyrdom and its growing strength ( and partly because of it ) , the fateful pattern spread . In spite of the rise of new forces of reform , advocating fuller civil rights for // everyone , including women 's right to the vote , and greater economic protection for children as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse , riding roughshod over the people 's rising clamor for some fundamental change , over the new challenge of a bold third party , known as the Populists ? which drew its support from farmers in the Middle West , from the agrarian South , as well as from industrial workmen in the cities , and which was committed to a broad , antitrust , democratic program of reform . Still the financial juggernaut rode on ? until the only way out for the men in the saddle , the men of money and power , was the promotion of the biggest deal yet : the promotion of open wars of aggression beyond our borders . Beneath their very feet While the struggle within our borders was growing sharper over the issue of genuine rule by and for the people , as opposed to rule by financial influence and power , our whole industrial machine was developing into the finest , smoothest technical achievement the world had ever seen . Even before the turn of the century , the quality and extent of our production in every field of exploitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smelters , rolling mills and public-utility plants ? was one of the earth 's wonders . Our land was flowering now with factories ? in city and country , along our coasts and among our plains , on most of our rivers and on the shores of our lakes , the wheels of new industry were turning . Our days were filled with the throb of motors and the roar of machinery , and our nights were lit by stars of fire shooting upward from our chimney stacks . By day and by night , our air was pungent not so much with the fragrance of the trailing arbutus and the honeysuckle as with the smell of oil and burning coke . Industry was setting its roots in every state of our Union ? even among the gray and the blue grass of that one-time " border " state , Kentucky : To begin at the richly-furnished and Brussels-carpeted sanctum , we find 193 // here at their respective desks President Davidson and Vice-President Straus ? the former tall , slender , fair and somewhat delicate in appearance , but with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility , authority and capacity ; the latter below the medium height , a decided brunette , alert , active , healthy , urbane and unassuming . Mr. Haldeman ( the Secretary and Treasurer ) confines himself to the counting - room , on Fourth Avenue , usually ( though on the occasion of our visit we found him hard at work assisting in making the stereotype plates for the Times , and later in supplying the multitude of screamingly impatient newsboys with bundles of that wonderfully successful and very popular journal ) . Adjoining the executive sanctum is the proof-room , where half-adozen pretty young ladies , smart as steel-traps , were busily engaged in the work of vigilantly searching out and marking , with neatness and dispatch , the errors of the unfortunate compositors in the next room , whither we proceeded . The job and book-composing room is one of the most spacious , lofty , best arranged , best lighted , best regulated and pleasantest ever provided to mitigate the misery of the printer . The equipment of material of all kinds ? types , frames , cabinets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a first-class establishment of the kind ? is complete , and embraces every style of new faces and every modern improvement that can add to the efficiency of the force , the attractiveness of the work done , or to the economy of time and labor . The same remarks apply to the book-bindery , on the same floor adjoining on the south ... . Retracing our steps through the composing-room and across the central hall , we visit the poster composing-room , where the large bills are gotten up that have spread the fame of the company all over the West and South . Then the Home and Farm and Periodical composing-room . Then back to the northwest corner , where we find the artists and engravers ? eight in number ? hard at work under the supervision of Mr. W. F. Clarke , an accomplished knight of the pencil and graver . Up one flight of stairs and in the north-east corner of the building we enter the electrotyping department and are introduced to Mr. A. Coquard , the skillful and ingenious foreman , and Mr. W. E. Whitehouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in processes , superior workmanship and economy of time obtain . And the seven employes turn out ? with perfected appliances , a powerful dynamo run by steam , // and the exercise of trained judgment ? as much work daily as was formerly done by four times the number of workmen . Bidding adieu to this home of molten metal , electric baths and precipitated copper , we enter the elevator , and in a few seconds step out into the press-room , in the basement . Few indeed , of those who tread securely along the sidewalks of Fourth and Green streets have an adequate notion of the work that is going on almost beneath their very feet . Here are located the boilers and engines , the lightning web presses upon which are printed those great newspapers ( the Courier-Journal and the Evening Times ) , the newspaper stereotyping apparatus , and the seventeen cylinder and nine small job presses of the Courier-Journal Job Printing Company ? together with the immense vaults wherein are stored the tons upon tons of book , news and poster paper of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that toil throughout the long hours of the day and night . . WITH SOLIDITY AND EVENNESS Beneath our very feet another kind of manufacturing was going on ? another kind of goods ( not newspapers or firearms , hobbyhorses or toothpaste , carriages or gumdrops ) was being turned out : The financiers of Boston ( closely interlocked by now with the big banking houses of Philadelphia and New York and our other great cities ) were busy as bees in the summertime ? and they were turning out their own brand of sweetening : The Whitney machine for the manufacture and moulding of legislation was complex but efficient . It achieved its wonders in broad daylight . Considering what it did and how it was done , the astonishing fact is that no outcry to speak of was ever raised at its performances . It was vastly bolder than Tammany and made fewer excuses for what it grabbed . But its chief engineer was a leading citizen , and his assistants all gentlemen of great respectability and admirable antecedents ? and in Boston , social and civic dictions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Legislature is not something a man may do with a fillip of his finger and thumb . However bold the operations the convenances must be observed . When really large designs are entertained , the manipulator begins before the preceding election and has had his " lawyers " at work throughout the country , seeing candidates and ascertaining their feelings . So a certain percentage of votes are signed and sealed in advance , ready for delivery at the proper time . But there is always a crowd of new men who must be taken care of on the spot , and these must be approached with tact . Some amateurs have fanatical notions of honor which interfere with both their own and the interests of franchise-grabbers . To deal with all these contingencies , to take care of captured votes and to shape legislative proceedings along safe lines , require the services of almost an army of men . At the head of Whitney 's forces was his lawyer , George H. Towle , big of brain , ponderous of frame , and with the strength of an ox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meaning of the word fear . Nothing aroused him to such frenzy as to have to do with a legislator who unnecessarily haggled over the price of his vote or influence . On such occasions , when a lieutenant had reported that Senator This or Representative That would not come into camp , Towle , with an oath , would simply say : " Take me to him , and I 'll have his vote in ten minutes ? or there 'll be occasion for a new election in his district tomorrow ! " Second in command was Mr. Patch , Towle 's secretary and factotum , his exact opposite in every way . Where Towle was brutally straight to the point , Mr. Patch was as smooth an intriguer as ever connected himself with secrets by way of keyholes and transoms . It is a Beacon Hill tradition that for years Towle on final-payment day would have the members of the Massachusetts Legislature march through his private offices one at a time , and , handing each of them their loot , would proclaim : " Well , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That represents your vote on  --  - and on  --  - . " Then he would loudly identify the bill and the particulars of the service , while behind a partition with a stenographer would be Mr. Patch , who after the notes had been written out would witness the accuracy of the stenographer 's report . When the Legislature assembled again , old members , the same story goes , would be requested to call on Towle to renew acquaintanceship . Then he would allow them to look over his memoranda ? " just to keep ' em from being too proud , " as he gently phrased it . // Subordinate to Towle and Patch was a long line of eminently respectable lawyers known all over the Commonwealth as " Whitney 's attorneys . " These men participated at nominations , orated at elections , and took care of the finer preliminary details . The first line of attack was composed of practical politicians of various grades ? ex-senators or representatives , and local bosses , who were known as " Whitney 's righthand men . " Below these were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept " tabs " on every move and deed , day and night , of the members of the Legislature . This was the Whitney machine ? and it worked together with that fine solidity and evenness which can only be attained with lots of practice and much success ... . Headquarters for Whitney 's Massachusetts Pipe Line were opened at Young 's Hotel , Parlors 9 , 10 , and r i , Rooms 6 , 7 , 8 , second story front . Parlors 9 and to were the general reception-room , while 11 was for the commander himself and the holding of important and " touchy " interviews . The Rooms q. , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 were used for educational purposes . ... At 5:3o the real business of the day began . Mr. Patch was generally on the ground first , carrying the books in which the bribery records were kept , for be it remembered that the efficiency of the Whitney machine was largely due to the thoroughly systematic manner in which its operations were conducted . Nothing was left to chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Precision and calculation ? these were the order of the day . These had conceived and engineered our great industrial system . And these were the mathematics by which the industries were developing into monopolies and trusts , the trusts were being taken over by holding companies , and the holding companies were held by the large banks ? whose boards of directors often included the heads of the holding companies as well as the heads of the trusts under them : These were the new controlling wheels within wheels ( hollow-ground , and emptied of conscience and honest care for one 's fellowman ) . And these were the interests ? Rockefeller and du Pont , Rogers and Morgan , Whitney , Mellon , Aldrich and Grace , and another handful or two ? that were shaping our country 's course by means of the almost absolute // power they were able to exercise over the nation 's pocketbook and over the policy-makers in Washington and every state of the nation . They were setting the direction of our lives , they were steering the ship ( it was getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But this was a democracy , and so the course that was being charted had to appear to come of the public 's free will and through the main channel of public opinion ? namely , the newspapers . The Hearst papers in particular were helping to prepare the way now for the most radical and ruthless course our country had ever embarked upon . The trusts were stronger than ever ( in spite of the politician 's talk and even the legislation aimed at curbing the trusts ) and new ones were springing up ? steel and munitions were already in the making . And the people were still dazed from the business disasters that had come with the depression of ' 93 . We had been fighting the advance of unemployment and wage reductions , hunger , and the kind of extreme want that people associated with the old worlds ( but not with America the golden ! ) . By protest and picket line , walkout and strike , we had been waging the fight of our lives ( for our friends and our fellows , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand at last ? in the face of injunctions and curfews , threats and militia , and the presence of Pinkerton and other industrial spies among us . We were taking our stand , through our growing unions and through the new organizations of liberal and bold-minded men and women that were coming to life . We were taking our stand for a better economic deal ? and then , before we knew it ( but not before the big interests knew it ) , we found ourselves in a different kind of fight . We had been dragged ( and drugged ) into a war with Spain ? for our country 's " honor , " we were told . But there was more than honor ( if honor at all ) to be gained from that war . There were huge profits to be gained from graft , as well as government concessions ( and the line between the two was frequently very thin ? it was more lucrative , for instance , to sell spoiled rather than good canned meat to the army , though it was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food poisoning than from the Spaniards ' bullets ) . The men of finance had wanted the war , and they were the ones who got the profits , while American big business got a new lease on life // ? a hold on Cuba , Puerto Rico , and the Philippines ( solid steppingstones to trade and power in the Caribbean , the Pacific and Asia ) . Everything worked as planned ( it was a new version of the old Hayes plan to get our minds off hard times by keeping us worried about what might happen elsewhere ) . But now the South was no longer the only major colony and proving ground for our big money men with capital to invest and goods to sell ( and always the need for cheap raw materials ) in order to stave off overproduction and hard times at home . We were moving across our borders now , to other parts of the world ( blindly , taking the germs and the bullets , doing the job for the diggers of the Pit ) . But there was a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new course of adventure . These new acquisitions were no easy purchase from a Mexican tyrant in the days when there were fewer nations and less concern for the achievement of nationhood . These new grabs of territory and territorial rights were no single purchase of Alaska from a willing Russia , no simple annexation of the Hawaiian Islands by means of a deftly engineered " revolution . " This was aggression ? and we were dealing with people who were determined to shake off the imperial Spanish yoke , not in exchange for a new American harness ( made in Wall Street , though it was stamped Washington ) , but in order to live as free men on their own soil . And they began to fight us ? from behind their boulders and their bushes , from their treetops ? as we had fought the British more than a century before . More than four years after our occupation of their islands , the Filipinos were fighting us ? and they were fighting hard : When officials are so discreet , the private individual feels justified in running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so nearly affecting our prestige and our well-being ) to the people ? who , after all is said and done , will have to pay the piper . Symptomatic and illustrative is the case of an important member of the civil government who is about to return to the United States on leave . The gentleman is a college man , a lawyer , and a former volunteer officer . I had many talks with him , and was much inte.ested in hearing what // he had seen during his three years in the Philippines as commander of troops , and latterly as governor of a province , and I was sorry that a man who talked so intelligently , who evidently based his conclusions upon facts shrewdly observed and astutely weighed , should take such pessimistic views of the situation . " Every day the conditions are becoming worse , " he said . " They are threatening to become chronic . Unless we can let light in from above , unless there is a change of policy very soon , the guerrilla warfare will not end for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have rubbed out ' the present inhabitants of the islands . " And of course this rubbing-out process will take even more time out here than it did on the plains , because the climate is against us and because the army and policy will not have behind them a stalwart frontier population backing them up and taking part in the fight when necessary . Something must be done soon to avoid the possibility of a hundred years ' war ? it is almost too late now , but yet something might be done . " " What would you suggest ? " I asked him . " Oh , well , you see that is not my business . It is a very pretty fight as it is between the civil and military authorities , and I should be a fool to get mixed up in it . Besides , I have troubles of my own . " What I will say , and even this must be confidential , is that we are confronted with a situation which , in my opinion , is not to be met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invariably to open a new bureau , man it with a chief and three or four score of clerks , equip it with swivel chairs and several batteries of typewriters ? nor yet by the military recipe , which seems to be to coax from the War Department 5,000 more fresh troops and send them hiking through the country for months at a time after an evasive foe , until worn-out and diseased , anaemic and disgusted , they begin to die like flies in a frost , and are put on transports and sent home again , dead or alive , but always , as far as this life is concerned , finished ? used up in useless service . " " When you get to Washington , " I said , " you will doubtless see the president and the authorities . You will tell them what you have seen as an officer in the field and as an administrator . You have had such exceptional opportunities that your testimony will have especial weight attached to it . " " When I get off the steamer , " answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do is to purchase a padlock . I will clasp that on my // mouth and throw the key down the deepest well I can find . No ? it is a very pretty fight as it is , and I am not looking for more trouble . " Undoubtedly the cautious , if unpatriotic , behavior of this official is typical of the conduct of many other officials , military as well as civil , in the islands . They talk very freely and frankly about the situation among themselves , but seem averse to allowing any of the information which they possess to pass the Pacific . The excuse for this trans-Pacific reticence , generally given me when I pressed for explanation , is that the poor narrow-minded folk at home are so apt to misunderstand that it is better to say nothing . One of the most amusing scenes in the human comedy which I have witnessed since I began to go behind the scenes takes place when in due process of time , and despite four or five captains apiece , an American transport arrives at San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are over , and when the representatives of the press come on board a veil is drawn over everything unpleasant . The crippled soldiers must keep out of sight , the metallic boxes are covered with tarpaulins , and the consumptives are admonished by the hospital stewards to " shut up their barking . " An era of good feeling is inaugurated which almost bridges the chasm between the civil and military factions . All agree that everything is over except the shouting . Only when the local press representatives become precise and ask for whom they should shout longest and loudest do the voices become at all discordant : Some say , " Old Wheaton . " Others are for Funston ? " the only general the soldiers can not keep up with . " And then there are praises for Merritt , who first sized up the situation ; for Otis , who crushed the rebellion ; for MacArthur , who pacified the Philippines , and for " Old Chaffee , " for whom there is really nothing left to do ? but who does it so well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , the press representatives are being escorted over the side when the captainquartermaster appears . He was a dentist three years ago , but now his duties are both military and naval . You can see him any clear day on the bridge . And any smooth day , when the ports are open and you can breathe , he ventures for thirty seconds at a time into the dormitories of the men down below , and says how sweet and clean they are . " You know , boys , how I hate newspaper notoriety , " he begins . " Still ,
