The House " Kitchen Committee " was back from France with orders for postwar wines and promises of better food . The sacrosanct smoking room had a new carpet , its lackeys new black uniforms with green lapel pipings . A new room was open where M.P.s-who sometimes have had to dictate to secretaries on hall benches-could transact their business . Even the mace , symbol of authority , had been regilded . <P> Thus , amid new comforts , Britain 's M.P.s , tanned and bright-eyed from a two-month recess , last week rolled up their sleeves for the fagend of the 1946 parliamentary session . <P> But the new comforts had solved neither Labor nor Tory problems . Energetic House Leader Herbert Morrison had his hands full with once-shy Labor left-wingers who had learned procedural ropes , were now ready to take the spotlight . They wasted no time in embarrassing one of their own ministers . When slim , tense Fred Bellenger made his first utterance in the House as War Minister , they pounced on him with " shocked surprise " at the two-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because of " intolerable " living conditions , the men , all privates , had refused to stand parade . One young paratrooper requested a divorce because " I am a criminal now .

Later the sentences were invalidated . <P> The Morrison Shift . The Tories looked wan and depressed . After the echoes of senior Party Leader Winston Churchill 's voice had died away at their Blackpool conference ( TIME , Oct. 14 ) , little solid matter was left . With Conservative Party policy only a. vague outline , the Tories could do little but peck pettishly at Herbert Morrison for using a Government automobile on a vacation trip . <P> Against Labor 's new rotation shift system , the Tories ( outnumbered 394 to 190 ) could put up nothing but strong black coffee and sheer physical stamina . <P> <P> Labor had split its forces into three groups , all of which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour , two groups would remain to ensure a working majority , while the third group retired to rest for next day 's late session . <P> At week 's end , Parliament was hip-deep in a session in which Prime Minister Clement Attlee 's Labor Government would try to complete nationalization already started ( steel , civil aviation , health , etc. ) , reveal its long-term measures for permanent socialization.
