 | I was thoughtful awhile ; then I replied : " Yes . I learned also : Ask , and it shall be given you . " " Oh , my bibi , " my mother said , " you are so much like your father . L'homme raisonnable ! " " My father is a great man , " I said stoutly . " Ah . . . and does n't he know it ! " she laughed . " But come , what is it you are so worried about ? " " Regard it this way : do you think the Lord remembers from the day of the lightning in Hull ? " " I think not , " my mother said calmly . " You were punished enough that day . " " Eh bien , " I agreed , relieved . " Then why does He not make a nice day when I pray for a nice day ? " " Oh , " my mother said easily , " suppose some poor farmer prayed for rain on the same day ? Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need sunshine ? " I blinked my eyes thoughtfully . So ! That 's how it was . There was competition . I stood there in silence , pondering this new development . " Pull up your stockings , " my mother commanded . I pulled up my stockings automatically and , deep in philosophic thought , left the kitchen . When my father came home from conducting the matinee I slid up on his bed and began questioning him , as he sat puffing his large cigar and rocking . My idea in these matters was to question everyone and then make a sort of digest . I told him of my lack of success with the weather . " Could it be , perhaps , " I said hesitantly , " the time of the home run in Hull ? " " No . No . That was last summer and the books of the Lord close , one understands , at Christmastime . N'est-ce pas ? " he said . " Oui , c'correc ' , " I agreed . It sounded very logical .  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the weather since I am mostly inside . As for prayers , one imagines the Lord has so much to do with the moon and the stars and small babies and sparrows that He does not have the time to grant every request . " " Is there no use in praying for a nice day ? " " To pray for a nice day , " he said , " is a very good idea . It is also well to have an umbrella and raincoat ready . " This , I could see , was getting me nowhere . My uncles Felix , Louis , and the more robust and elegant Desmonde had all gone to Montreal with my grandfather on what they referred to as " business " and what my mother called " another spree . " So there was no one else with whom to discuss the problem . Oh , there was , of course , my aunt Felice and my lovely cousin , Yvonne , but they were Frenchwomen and , however I loved them , I knew their answers would only complicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in spite of the fact that I had not prayed at all . The picnic was held , and I won second prize in the three-legged race . It was a Bible , which I had to share with my collaborator , Egbert LaTouche . I gave him the Old Testament and kept the New for myself , because the New had in it a great deal of red printing and seemed much more colorful than the Old , which was completely black . The next week I thumbed through the New Testament and read once more that if I asked I should receive and that if I knocked it would be opened unto me . This scholarly reading restored my confidence somewhat and cleared up my confusion slightly . Do n't misunderstand . Under no circumstances did I blame the Lord personally for my confusion . I want to note that for the record . My father 's simple statement had made me aware of the magnitude of His job . I felt there might possibly be something  | lacking in my conduct . ( To be sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manner in which I phrased my pleas was wrong . For a short time I wondered if it were possible that the Lord and I did not speak the same language . But yes  --  for my mother had often said that the Devil was French and le bon Dieu was English . Ah , well , the next big test , the ultimate test , was soon arriving . It was the Central Canada Exhibition . This great fair , held annually at Ottawa , was like heaven itself . There was a midway filled with sideshows , merry-go-rounds , Ferris wheels , and such . There were also steamed corn , dripping with butter , and Canadian apples covered with transparent candy , held firmly on a red stick . There were rows and rows of Canada 's prize products : great golden sheaves of wheat from the prairie provinces , fruit from Ontario and British Columbia , shining minerals from the mining provinces , and furs from the Yukon and Hudson Bay . There were pumpkins and grapes , chickens and cows , great bulls and proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , was there any end to the wonders of the Exhibition ? There were soldiers of all kinds and the Royal Northwest Mounted Police in scarlet coats , riding thoroughbreds . There were buildings after buildings housing the products of Canada 's industrial and agricultural might , as well as her production genius , and in every one , it seemed , there were booths with free samples for little boys . One came home with a huge paper shopping bag overflowing with small packets of corn flakes , caramels , tooth paste , apples , cobalt , toys , calendars , blotters , pamphlets  --  such a chest of treasures ! Best of all was the brilliant show every night before the grandstand . Here , daredevils drove cars recklessly through soaring  | scarlet flames ; motorcycles sped around the dirt track and jumped obstacles at breakneck speed ; army cavalry and dragoon guards executed precision drills with horses as well taught as the soldiers ; beautiful girls danced and sang like angels , lit by lights now pink , now blue , now amber , reminding me of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home ; and , in the end , a dazzling display of fireworks , climaxed in a set piece of a huge maple leaf . I had been before , of course , but we had sat near the top of the stand . Since I was small , and what with people 's hats and iron girders in the way , I had missed half the fun . This year I decided to pray , not only that I ride the Ferris wheel ( a pleasure always denied me as too dangerous ) , but that I should have a front-row box in the grandstand where no one could possibly be in front of me . The Exhibition was held in September , for the weather then is like a dream brought on by wine . It was still summer when I began to pray . Consequently I was able to devote considerable time to the matter . The notion even came to me that my trouble all along had been , perhaps , that I was asking for things too insignificant for the Lord to notice  --  things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and show what He could do . Well , here was something to put Him on his toes , all right . Alas , the first day of the Exhibition arrived , a day filled with intoxicating crispness , and I was not even taken . My mother murmured something about the expense and the difficulty of moving through the dense , laughing , pushing crowds . The second day she came right out and said : " I really do n't think you should go this year , bibi . You eat every single sample of everything you can chew . Last year you ate three boxes of  | shredded wheat , a small jar of pickles , a piece of layer cake , and a Northern Spy within ten minutes . " The pickles I did not recall . " Maman , " I objected . " There was only one pickle . It was marked 57 and it was worn on the coat like a badge . It was not to eat . " Allons done ! " my mother exclaimed . " Did he die ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boy . " " He came very close to it , " my mother retorted . " Especially the time he chewed on the piece of perfumed soap . " " It is not fair , " I said meekly , " to make soap in the shape of a maple leaf and in the color of maple sugar . " " Oho ! " Papa laughed . " The world is full of such confusion . Soap pretends to be delicious maple sugar and mothers show their love for their children by withdrawing from them the greatest pleasures . We live , these days , in a windmill . " My mother regarded my father with narrowed eyes . " It is I who must take his temperature and feed him baking soda while you do nothing but make crincrin ! " Crincrin is an old French word for a squeaky violin . If one gives it the correct nasal tone it is a nasty sound . It never failed to make Papa hold on to his ears and be silent . I decided not to debate with my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Go wash your face . Mother knows best . " Then , in washing my face , I would forget what I wanted to say . Besides , my face seemed to be wearing out from weeping and washing . I gritted my teeth and marched calmly to my room , deciding to remain firm in my faith , an army with banners . I kneeled down and prayed silently , eloquently , and at great length . If it were to be a struggle now between my dear Maman and the good Lord , I was determined , a little regretfully , to be on the side of the angels .  | Thursday came and went and no Exhibition for me . I was confused and dismayed . I was , as my uncle Louis would say , unbuttoned . On Friday my Grandfather appeared , full of good cheer , his mustache waxed even more than usual . We had a gay dinner of frogs ' legs Grandpa had brought from Montreal . I was permitted , too , a sip of the brandy . This , plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me temporarily happy . After dinner my Grandfather told us one of his histoires abracadabrantes , wild tales that no one but I believed . It had to do with a mermaid he had sighted in the St. Lawrence River and who had disappeared before he could get a good grasp of her tail . She left behind , however , he explained wistfully , a lovely pearl earring . Grandpa elegantly presented it to my blushing mother . ' That is why Louis , Desmonde , and Felix did not return with me . They are , you know , still looking for the mermaid . " Everyone laughed and we were all quite happy . Later , when he was still in a good mood and before he had a chance to fall asleep , I begged my grandfather for an audience . Such was the way it was with Grandfather . He stood on ceremony . " Is it of eternal significance ? " he solemnly inquired , twirling his mustaches . " It is . It is about me and God and the Exhibition . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bishop . " Hmmm . Very well . Come to my room in ten minutes . Set your watch . " I thanked him and set my watch . In exactly ten minutes I was in his room , standing nervously before him , tugging on my long black stockings and moistening my lips . " Sit down , " he said . " We are longer under the earth than we  | are above it . " He dipped his hand into a box of what I knew to be chocolates with cognac centers . " Allons-y , bibi ! " he urged , licking the melting chocolate from his fingers . I told him the entire story of the struggle between the Lord and me , from God 's home run in Hull , through the Sundayschool picnic , to date . He threw his head back against the well-cushioned rear of his adjustable rocker and wiped his lips with a white silk handkerchief . " Aha ! " he muttered . " Mmmm . A delicate situation . " He looked off into space in such a completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ghost of Jeanne d'Arc . It was his strange impression that she sometimes communicated with him . But no , he turned suddenly to me , pointed a shaky finger , and demanded : " How many angels can dance on the point of a needle ? " " As many as want to , I imagine , " I said , annoyed at this irrelevancy . " Ha ! Exactly . It depends on the size of the needle and the size of the angels . Est-ce correct ? " " C'correc ' , " I agreed dully , with a disinterested shrug . " Attends . Par example . . . I merely wish you to know that these matters are not so simple . " He put his fingers once more to his lips and pondered . " Come , " he said . " Let me see you pray , s'il vous plait . " " Maintenant ? " " Yes , of course . The sooner the better . " I kneeled slowly and shyly by his bed . I had intended the actual praying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . Nevertheless , I folded my hands to a point and remained silently in this position for a few moments . When I arose my grandfather regarded me with wide eyes . " Mon Dieu ! You prayed ? " " But , of course , " I replied , irked . My grandfather folded his arms across his thin chest and announced sternly : " I heard nothing . " In silence , " I said , " I prayed . " " In silence ! Name of a blue cow ! " " At Sunday school they tell us the good Lord is everywhere . He hears our prayers when they are not spoken . " My grandfather swiftly swallowed two cognac chocolates . He licked his fingers again and said : " Bah ! Everywhere people are praying , no ? Each one has perhaps as good a claim to attention as the other . Each one has as good a claim , if not better , than you . You are , crois-tu , mon chouchou , one of the least in the scheme of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I protested . Grandpa shook his head slowly and sadly as if the spiders were spinning their webs in my head . " Yes , " he said . " Yes . It is true , my little cabbage . He sees the little sparrow fall . But He does nothing to prevent it . The trouble is obvious . Your prayers have not been answered . Why ? Because you are a bad boy ? No . Because you steal my candy ? Because you wash the face and escape the ears ? No . It is because of this reason : you do not pray loud enough ! " " Like this ? " I asked eagerly , " Dear Lord , make it so .. " " No , no , no , no , no , no , no  --  LOUD ! " " You mean shout ? " " But , of course . Ask loudly and it shall be given you quickly . Tonight , when it is time for your prayers , pray as if the Lord were downstairs  --  or , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bedroom with the door closed . Pray clearly , enunciating each word with care , as if the good Lord were slightly deaf . Pray with feeling , with confidence , with enthusiasm , with elan ! Pray , c'est a dire , as if you meant it . Now , you may go . The interview is over . I must sprinkle myself with some cognac . " I must say this idea of Grandpa 's struck me as somewhat strange . If God was everywhere  --  in the mountains , in the sea , in the forests , in the homes  --  then , why need I shout to be heard ? Yet , when it was bedtime I knelt hopefully down and I began in a voice usually saved to cheer hockey players : " Dear Lord , make my mother take me to the Exhibition and make us have a good seat in the very front row so I will see something and not be prevented by people 's chapeaux and iron posts , especially the fireworks and other wonders . " I went on bellowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My voice took on new vibrance . I painted myself in glowing colors . I noted my friendliness to small animals , my willingness to do errands at M. LaBelle 's store , my deep love and respect for my parents , my keeping intact the entire Ten Commandments ... and so forth . I called , finally , upon the Lord to sustain my faith . Suddenly , when I had finished with the Exhibition and was going through the blessings , I heard a voice call . I had arrived at : " Bless my dear , good , very beautiful mother , " when she cried : " Not so loud , bibi ! Everyone in the block can hear you . Mon Dieu ! " I quieted down and climbed into bed . I was nibbling softly on some shortbreads and reading The Green Fairy-Tale Book when my grandfather peeked in the door . ' Well done , mon chouchou , " he said . " But the next time , please , not quite so loud . "  | Would you believe it , my grandfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Exhibition without a word being said . I sat in a front box and I saw everything . I even rode up close to heaven on the Ferris wheel , twice ! When I got home tired , and quite blissful in spite of the many samples rumbling together in my small stomach , there was still a point that troubled me . " Grand p  --  re , " I said , before I went to bed , " it is true the Lord answered my prayer , but how does it happen He was able to tell Maman how many times I wished to ride on the Ferris wheel and exactly where I wished to sit in the grandstand ? " My grandfather dipped nonchalantly into the cognac chocolates . " It is not good , " he said solemnly , " to inquire too deeply into His mysterious ways , "  | The Butterlly and My Uncle Louis Sometime after the Exhibition was a memory and another summer had arrived , my grandfather , playing at our house ( as my father observed ) a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis . " Recall to yourself , " Grandfather said , " what I taught you about prayer . " " I recall , " I replied . " Louis , you know , is having more and more rooms to let in the head . Whole apartments are vacant . " " Ah , " I said , noncommittal . Louis , Desmonde , Felix , Papa , Grandpapa  --  all were considered by the neighbors to be mad . It was not for me to measure one against the other . " Perhaps you should pray for him loudly , " Grandpa said .  | " Now ? " I inquired nervously . Louis was a good friend of mine and often played soldier with me . I did not want to upset him . He had already announced a number of times that he was dying , and I felt very sad about it . " Now . But not here . Next door where both Louis and the Lord can hear you . Pray that the Lord remind Louis to stop filling himself with white wine  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yvonne . . . " " Why , " I asked quietly , " do you not pray for him ? " Grandpa turned his head a bit and looked at me with narrowed eyes as if I , too , were odd . " I am too old to pray , " he announced solemnly , after some thought . " I have used up , long ago , my quota . " " Me , I wish also to save my prayers for when I am old . " Grandfather sighed and showed me a glass of hot , spiced wine , violet in color . " Look , you may have a drink of my bischof if you pray for Louis . " I smiled , and drank the warm wine colored as joyfully as the cleric 's robe . " Eh bien , " I agreed . " I pray . " I went next door where Uncle Louis was sleeping on the couch in the front room . Kneeling down by the bed , I pointed my fingers and began loudly : " Louis a mal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided perhaps English might be better . " Louis has gone wrong . He is become a rascal and reddens all the time his nose with white wine . Poor Felice ! Poor Yvonne ! Dear Lord , make Uncle Louis go to church and save his soul ! " I had , of course , decided that if I were to save Uncle Louis at all I might as well save him with thoroughness . Besides , I enjoyed the sound of my noble words . I sounded almost like the  | angelic Reverend McKintosh of the Presbyterian church . " Oncle Louis a mal tourn ? , " I repeated loudly . Uncle Louis sat up suddenly . He blinked his puffy eyelids and said : " Qu'est-ce ? dire ? " " Grandpa says you drink too much white wine and are becoming vacant in the head . " Uncle Louis raised his heavy eyebrows and his red nose twitched . " Name of a blue cow ! " he cried . " He whose own nose runs always wishes to blow other people 's ! My father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not only say it behind his back . I will tell it to his whiskers ! " " Je ne dis pas , " I said quickly , refusing to commit myself and wishing I had not taken on the task of saving Uncle Louis . The truth was that I did not relish it . " You , of all people , my friend ! " Louis exclaimed , almost in tears . " A thousand pardons , " I said anxiously . " Forgive me . " " A man , " my uncle muttered , tossing around his tousled hair , " who sees mermaids in the St. Lawrence should not speak of the vacant heads of others . " This seemed logical to me . I had forgotten about the mermaid . Mermaids , I knew , did not exist . Angels , devils , and fairy princes , yes . Mermaids , no . " Ah , well , " Uncle Louis sighed , pouring himself a large glass of white wine , " let us forget Grandpa . Let us get on with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a set of cardboard French soldiers and a set of English ones from it . One set I lined up under the window ; the other I placed some distance away . Then I arranged two wooden cannon with springs and small wooden shells .  | Uncle Louis groaned as he stretched out on the floor and took aim with his cannon . " Wait , " I exclaimed . " Always you go first . " " I am the oldest , " Uncle Louis said with dignity . He pulled back the piston of his cannon and fired at my British soldiers . His shell hit the drummer in the band but did not knock him over . " Oho ! " Uncle Louis shouted . " What kind of soldiers are these ? A cannon ball does not knock them down ! It bounces ! You cheat , no ? You have given me ammunition that bounces . " " It is the same for me , " I observed . I took aim and knocked down one of his cavalrymen . We went on for a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in the window . Uncle Louis was deathly afraid of butterflies . He had , in his youth , collected and stuck pins through them . Now , he insisted , they were after revenge . They fluttered all the time in his stomach and in his head . He saw the butterfly just as he was about to shoot . He aimed the cannon at the butterfly , pulled the piston , and missed . Tossing aside the cannon , he seized a gnarled walking stick and began to chase the small yellow creature , lashing out at it now and then , and succeeding in breaking a window and two vases . " The butterfly will do you no harm , " I shouted at him . " It will sting ! " Uncle Louis yelled . " Va donc ! " he cried at the intruder . " Va donc ! Va-t-en chez nous ! Allez ! Allez vite ! " " Bees sting , " I told him , dodging the blows of the cane . " If a bee stings , what will prevent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Even a bee does not sting if you make friends . " " Oho !

" Abruptly he gave out the sort of yell I myself often made in recitations , when I was mortally wounded . " I am bit ! " Louis bellowed , as the ' butterfly went out the window . " I am bit . " He showed me his hand and , sure enough , there was a small , red swelling . " What did I tell you ? " he announced triumphantly . " Butterflies do not sting , eh ? Oho ! Regard the wound ! " My aunt Felice ran from the kitchen . " What happens here ? " she asked crisply . " No sympathy , please , " Uncle Louis insisted grandly , " no pity . No woman 's tears . " " What happened ? " Felice persisted . Uncle Louis flung himself on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a dying statement . " A butterfly bit him , " I explained . " Watch , " my uncle warned . " Watch ! She will laugh ! " " Butterflies do not bite , " Felice stated firmly . " You see ? Felice , too ! In the face of all proof  --  ah , well , when I am dead you will believe me . " He rested his head on a pillow and folded his hands across his stomach as one was laid out in state . " I die , " he said quietly . " You die every week , " Felice said . " You can not die now , anyway , since Alfred is waiting to speak to you . " " Alfred ? Alfred ? Who is Alfred ? " " Alfred , the fianc ? of Yvonne  --  he wishes to speak to you of something important . " " Yvonne has a fianc ? ? " Uncle Louis inquired in astonishment . " How many times do I tell you ? " Felice asked .  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " A man 's dearest possession  --  his only child is to be stolen from him and no one apprises him of the fact . Believe me , we live in a strange world . " " Do not let your bile boil over it , " Felice said . " He is a nice boy . She went quietly out of the room . " Do you die ? " I asked , a little worried . " I do not die until I regard Alfred , " Louis replied . The young man soon entered . His hair was shiny and he smelled of lavender . He wore a dark , stiff suit and a very , very shiny white collar . He looked like a gentleman . " Ah , bon jour , bon jour. ? a va ? " Uncle Louis asked the uneasy boy . " Je me porte bien , " Alfred replied formally . The poor sweating fellow stood there in silence some moments as my uncle reclined . " Come , come , speak up ! " Louis commanded . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I am filled with love for Yvonne . " " Ah , why not ? Proceed , please . " " I work in a bank ... " Louis opened his eyes wide . " A bank , eh ? Bien ! How is the international trade these days ? What is the situation with Swiss gold francs ? How can one invest wisely and make large sums with no risk ? Eh ? What do you think of Canadian Pacific Railway ? Is it expected to rise ? My brother , you know , plays sometimes on the side for chamber music in one of the railway hotels , the Ch  --  teau Laurier , of course . A genius , my brother . We are all geniuses in this family . My brother 's son here , we are also expecting to become a genius ... eh ? " " What is that ? A genius ? " I asked . I received no reply .  | Alfred was shifting his large feet and blushing . " No doubt , no doubt , " he muttered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Swiss francs , nor geniuses . I add up the checks every day . I add up also the coins . As for the Ch  --  teau Laurier , I can not afford such elegant place . I am a simple man . " " Hmmmn , " Uncle Louis murmured in disapproval . " That is what I feared . " With five bunched fingers he scratched the end of his red nose . " Tell me , my boy , about your salary . " " It amounts , " Alfred recited , " to fifteen dollars weekly with a small increase each year until it reaches twenty-two . There , one understands , it is stabilized . " " Ah . Mm . Yes . Stabilized , eh ? " Uncle Louis got up and began to pace around the room . " Stabilized , eh ? At twenty-two dollars , eh ? It does not rise beyond this ? " " Only in the case of a remarkable feat of some sort . " " Ah , let us stick to reality . Twenty-two dollars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I will work hard . Perhaps I will find also another position .

" " About the salary , Yvonne knows this . " Uncle Louis stood up and pointed a finger of scorn at Alfred . " Yvonne knows it , yes ! Yvonne will live on what the bees bring her , like the flowers do . There is a girl who should have been born a flower instead of a human being . But is such a thing possible ? To live on love and kisses ? You wish to live on fifteen , twenty dollars weekly . Very well . Children are born , no ? Combien ? " Alfred swallowed hard and blushed again . " One can not tell . . .

McGill perhaps , eh ? Toronto ? Queens ? Good . But how are you going to send five boys to the university on twenty-two dollars a week , stabilized ? " He smiled triumphantly at Alfred and brought down his gnarled cane on the table with a crash that startled the boy . I began to feel very sorry for him . " We do not intend to send the children to the university , " he said meekly . " What ? " Uncle Louis said . Alfred edged back from the raised cane . " WHAT ? " Uncle Louis repeated . " Here is a man with five grown boys and he wishes to deny them what he owes them most ? an education !

What have you been doing all these years with your money ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disillusioned ? Have you taken , perhaps , to drinking and gambling at the races ? Do you spend your nights in Hull in the saloons ? " Here , Uncle Louis swiftly gulped down a good helping of white wine . " Have you , " Uncle Louis went on , smacking his lips , " been carousing while Yvonne , now pale and thin , waits at home for you to come spinning in , hoping you will have left at least a few sous for a bone with which to make soup for the children who have not tasted food in two days ? " Alfred , by this time , had reached the door . Uncle Louis ' face was scarlet and his voice had mounted to dramatic vibrance . " Pardon ! " Alfred said very nervously . " Perhaps some other time we shall speak about it . Now , I am a little mixed . Bon jour.  | He bowed hastily with fear in his eyes , put on his black derby , and vanished . Uncle Louis flopped down on the couch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiringly . " Since you are bit by the butterfly you are cruel like the ogre in my fairy book , " I announced calmly , shooting down some soldiers . " Me ? " Louis shouted . " Me , cruel ? I am sweet as the hummingbird ! I love my daughter . " " Me , too , I love her . Also Alfred loves her . " " Pouf/ Alfred is too stabilized for my Yvonne . " I shrugged . " He smells nice , " I said . " The smell is not everything , " Louis reminded me . " Mlle Charbon also smells nice , but she has an eye of glass and teeth of china . " " Alfred says he will work hard for Yvonne and be rich , " I added . Uncle Louis sat up and regarded me for some time . Then he began to laugh . " Oho , bibi . You are the son of your mother , believe me . He will work hard and be rich ! Name of a blue sheep ! If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would sleep in a bed of gold ! Oho ! " He took another large glass of wine and then fell back . Soon he began to snore . I slowly put away the cannon and the wooden soldiers . As I started to tiptoe out of the room , Louis opened his eyes . " Do not be angry , bibi , " he said plaintively . " The bite of a butterfly is sometimes fatal to a man of my years . " " I know , " I said wearily . Then I went home to tell Grandpa that the Lord and I had failed to make an impression on Uncle Louis . We had been beaten by a butterfly .  | The Many-Colored Glass I was not really too sad to see Alfred dismissed . In the first place , I knew he would be back in time . In the second place , I now had Yvonne mostly to myself . I could play with her again , and to my heart 's content , the game of Sleeping Beauty . They were days of color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them alone is enough to prove it . I came down in the morning and stopped before the stainedglass window on the landing . I stood on tiptoe and clutched the frame with my small hands . Slowly I pressed my nose against the blue fragment of glass . It was night when you looked through the blue . But , oh , what a night ! A night whose color is found only in dreams after reading fairy tales , the sort of night when all is blue and yet all is perfectly clear .  | I moved over and put my face against the amber pane . Now the whole world was bathed in heat as if , far away , a great fire lit the world . Faintly , far from the glowing world , I could hear my mother moving about in the kitchen , washing dishes . " Yes , " I could hear her tell Papa , " the Boy is having his nap . " I came now to the green glass . The green one I liked second best . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses and the people and even the sky were bright spring green-gold . Spring was so short in Ottawa it was good to have it hidden away secretly here . For a long time I looked through the green , and I thought it was the world in which knights fought and sleeping beauties were kissed and brought back to life . I heard my mother in the kitchen again . My uncle Louis had come in through the back door and was looking for my grandfather . Maman said Grandfather had gone to the burlesque and asked Louis to go to the store and bring her des patates . Louis scorned the errand , pointing out that he had a feud with m . LABELLE , ? PICERIE since M. LaBelle had given him an exploding cigar on April Fish Day . I knew if I were discovered I would be forced to carry home a heavy half peck of potatoes from M.

On a holiday one did exciting things , one did not run to the grocer 's . There was so much I had to do . From under the veranda , I fished forth two sticks : a large one , pointed at the end , and a short one . With the long one I drew a circle in the dirt of the driveway . It was a magic sign to protect me.  | Then , because there was , alas , no one else to do it , I tapped myself on the shoulder and said : " I dub thee Knight . Rise , Sir Galahad ! " The sword I had made from the short stick crossed over the long one and held together by my fingers . Halfway up the street a cat came out of Mlle Charbon 's . This cat threatened to attack me . She drew away and raised her back . I drew my sword and pointed it . Ah , this is no cat before me ! I should have known .

I advanced on the tiger whose great eyes were burning brightly through the jungle of Mlle Charbon 's front lawn , which badly needed cutting . " En garde ! " I shouted at the tiger . I was a man of chivalry even with animals . Besides , I liked to cry : " En garde ! " The tiger spat at me , and I thrust the sword at her . She jumped back and begged for mercy , thus : " Uh , puh . . sssst ! " I laughed and decided not to slay her , for I was , after all , a knight who was both brave and strong , and gentle and tender , too . The tiger turned around and slunk into the jungle to find , perhaps , a grasshopper or a mouse . I went to the corner and turned up toward Strathcona Park . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much trouble , although , for most people , it was quite invisible . Here , with my map and compass , I located the spot where the treasure had been buried centuries ago . My sword became , by magic , a spade , and I dug excitedly for some time .  | Suddenly my spade struck something hard . It was one of those great moments when the pick glances off the metal and the rusty chest shows a gleaming silver . Eagerly I scraped away the dirt with my hands and there , shining and golden , were the fabulous doubloons  --  doubloons that anyone else would have passed by as mere brass buttons from the uniform of a policeman . I put the treasure back into the chest and covered it carefully . It was better to leave it there , I considered , than to remove it . People would only ask questions if they saw me with so many riches . I came out of the cave and sprawled on a bench . My two sticks now became the controls of a racing automobile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was the world 's greatest dirttrack driver . And now , my goggles thick with dust , my face covered with grease spurting from a faulty engine , I was on the second last lap . Around I swept , defying death at the turns , keeping just behind Number 13 , who led me by a length . How the stands cheered me on ! I was their favorite and they did not wish to see me lose so important a race . Now the flag was waved and the last lap was on . Closer and closer we came to the finish line , and slowly I came abreast of Number 13 . It was only in the last few seconds that I flashed across the finish line first ! I jumped out of my champion car , bowed to the wildly cheering crowd , and then ran across the park to the place where there was a hockey rink in the winter . Fitting the small piece of wood into a notch in the side of the long one , I made a hockey stick . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few minutes of the World 's Hockey Championship between Seattle 's red-white-and-green warriors and Ottawa 's famous Senators .  | The crowd was frantic . The score was tied . I was Frank Nighbor , Canada 's immortal poke-check genius . Hooking the puck from the Seattle forward , I shot it angularly at the boards and around him , picked it up again and nursed it down the boards near my " own goal . Speeding around the cage to gain momentum , I skated soon , like a flash , across the center line , moving swiftly and gracefully in and out of the Seattle defense , at last drawing out the redwhite-and-green goalie to leave an open net , in which I easily pocketed the winning goal . The red light behind the Seattle net flashed . The crowd went almost insane two seconds later when the gong rang loudly , announcing the end of the third period and of the game . The citizens of Ottawa , champions of the hockey world once more and again possessors of the huge , famed Stanley Cup , came swarming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their shoulders and carried me triumphantly across the street to Mme LaVerne 's ice-cream parlor . I waved my hockey stick , which had now become a magic wand , and the tiny two-cent ice-cream cone I had purchased became an enormous mountain of the Ottawa Dairy 's finest cr  --  me ? la glace . Nibbling happily at the peak of this strawberry mountain , I went out of the store . For a while after the ice cream had disappeared , I explored . I discovered rare orchids which might have looked like violets to one without magic . I came across a bright red unicorn and an elephant no bigger than a kitten . I considered putting them into cages and taking them home to Maman , but I changed my mind . In the first place , I thought , they will probably frighten Uncle Louis . In the second place , Maman . will say they are a nuisance around the house . So , I merely waved my wand and they disappeared . The orchids , how ever , I tucked into my blouse for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I arrived home and went around the back way to find my Sleeping Beauty . There she was , as ever , eternally faithful , sleeping in the soft green grass under the apple tree .  | For a second I watched her and wondered how such a beauty could love Alfred . Then I decided she did not love Alfred  --  she only wished to marry him . It was me she really loved , but I was too small to marry and I did not have fifteen dollars a week , stabilized . I brushed these unhappy thoughts from my mind and crept up behind Yvonne quietly and kissed her gently on the forehead . " Awake , beautiful princess ! " I cried . Yvonne opened her lovely , shining eyes , still misty with golden dreams . She raised her pretty head and the blue-black hair showered over her shoulders . " Oh ! C'est le prince ! " she sighed , flattening the love curls at the side of her head : little , soft " hooks to catch a heart . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prince announced . " Merci . Merci bien , mon prince ! For this , I will show you a real witch ! " " Parbleu ! " the prince cried . " I have not seen a real witch in a long time . " Yvonne placed a slim , regal white finger to her sweet red mouth , and I followed her quietly . The prince , of course , should have gone first by all the rules of the fairy-tale books . But , alas , the prince did not , in this case , know the way to a real witch . We came to a small window of the cellar of a house up the street . " Look ! " Yvonne whispered . " But do not let her see you or she will turn you into one of her black cats . " I looked through the corner of the window . It was , crois-tu , a witch ! She was surrounded by cats and a broomstick stood by her side . This witch sat in the cellar , smoking a small cigar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was disguised as Mlle Charbon , who taught the grade eights , but Yvonne and I , who  | knew magic , were not fooled . The cats and the broomstick were the proof . Yvonne and I looked at each other and laughed , and then ran , singing , back to the house . My mother called to me as she heard the door open . She came out of the dining room , where she had been setting the table . " Hello , bibi , " she said , kissing me . " My , you are dirty ! " She smiled tenderly . " And what have you been doing all this beautiful day ? " " Nothing , " I said , yawning . " Where have you been ? " " Nowhere , " I replied lazily , looking around to see if there was johnnycake for dinner . Maman hugged me and looked at me , puzzled . " You must have done something . " " No . Nothing . I just walked . " My mother looked at me with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the dining room with some brandy glasses . I went up the stairs slowly and into my room . From my blouse I took the orchids I had forgotten to give the princess and placed them in the glass of water on my bureau . Then I went down to the stair landing and stopped once more before the window of many-colored glass . I heard my mother in the dining room say to Papa : " Really , it is not good for the Boy to be alone so much and to do nothing in his spare time . He must become a Boy Scout or join the Y.M.C.A. " " Maman , ch  --  re maman , " I wanted to say , " no Boy Scout , no Junior of the Y.M.C.A. could keep up with me . No other boy could go through my adventures and come out alive . No one else could fight tigers , discover orchids , find buried treasure , win  | world 's championships , kiss princesses , and see a witch all on the same bright day . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand the world of magic as it really is ? Instead , I looked through the best glass of all , the pink one , and all the world was the color of a fresh , young rose .  | The Canary Who Lived a Full Life There were , in my early life , three important canaries . The first came to visit us one morning when my father was practicing the violin in his room and Maman and I were watering the flowers on the front lawn . Maman was saying : " This year Mlle Charbon 's geraniums will come first , I 'm afraid . She sits in the cellar after school and smokes a cigar all evening and yet her geraniums blossom a beautiful scarlet  --  and without the least care . She must have a green thumb . " " Mais non , " I countered . " She has a black thumb . " I spoke in hushed tones . " She is , you know , a witch . I have seen the broomstick she rides and the black cats . Ask Yvonne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casually , not astonished at the revelation . " She uses black magic on the geraniums , " I went on softly . It was then a flash of yellow went by us . We looked at each other , surprised and laughing . " That was a big bee , " my mother joked .  | " It was a bird , " I said excitedly . " It was a canary , " Maman amplified . " Ne vous trompez pas , monsieur ! " " A canary ? " I exclaimed , chewing on a pungent geranium leaf . " But how about the kitten of Aunt Felice . We were to make for it a home . I promised Yvonne . " My mother picked up the watering can and started for the house . " Uncle Louis , you know , says the cat is after him . " " After all , " my mother remarked , " it is not our canary . Besides , a kitten can not eat a canary in a cage . " We followed the bird into the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was playing . He was now improvising delicate birdlike music . The canary was standing on the brass knob of the bedstead , his head cocked to one side , trilling away . Together they made a charming duet until my father became complicated and the bird became all mixed up . The canary put his head down under his wing as if he were ashamed . Papa smiled and wiped off his violin carefully with the old , white silk scarf and put the instrument away . Then he sat in his chair and lit a cigar . He began to smoke and rock , keeping his eyes on the canary . My mother and I sat down on the bed . " Be careful of your shoes on the clean spread , " my mother warned . I curled up so that my feet hung over the edge of the bed . My father nodded his head with mock gallantry and said : " Bon jour , mes amis . Pourquoi nous sommes ici ? " " Well , " my mother replied , we are here because someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cage . Canaries do not live in trees in Canada . The canary belongs to someone . "  | " Is it , " my father queried , flicking the long ash from his cigar , " that you invited the bird in here ? Did you lure it ? Did you smile , perhaps ? Even a bird would swallow your smile . " My mother blushed . " No , " she replied . " You see , " Papa went on , " this canary here has made a free choice . N'est-ce pas ? " Maman was slightly confused . " We will get a cage , then , " she suggested . " We will not get a cage , " my father contradicted gently . " The bird arrived freely ; it shall depart freely . " " Oho ! " I exclaimed , " what about the time of winter , eh ? In winter even I must wear a wool chapeau showing only my eyes . A canary , with only feathers and no wool cap ... " Papa interrupted with a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he announced . " This bird has in his song , which I understand completely , expressed the desire to live his own life . This is a desire that should be granted . " He puffed on his cigar , enjoying his moment of philosophy . " How do you know ? " I asked . " How do you know what the canary wishes ? " His eyes twinkling , my father looked at Maman . " Tell the Boy , " he urged her . " Inform him . " My mother tightened her mouth and then said : " Your father has the notion he understands the language of birds and small animals . When I first met him he was playing in a summer hotel near a woods . He told me on the first day that he had been speaking to a lark who wished us to visit him in the woods . " " My father speaks with birds ? " I cried in astonishment . " Your father , " Maman announced with a faintly cold tone , " is a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed . " He is greater even than I thought . " " Yes , " said Papa .  | " Wait ! " my mother exclaimed suddenly , " this is maybe Mlle Charbon 's canary . " Who is Mlle Charbon ? " Papa asked . " The one who brings Uncle Louis the hot soup when he is sick , " said my mother . " The soup with which he waters the flowers , " I added . " It is the spirit that counts , not the soup , " my mother reminded me . " He prefers hot wine to hot soup , " I said . " Mlle Charbon is smart enough ; she should know this . She teaches school and is also a witch . " " A witch , " said my father with an air of finality , " has no right to a canary . " " Still , " my mother noted worriedly , " it is not ours . " " It is our guest , " Papa concluded . " Let us fix it there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we named the bird ) made a concert together . Every day Papa played and the bird trilled joyfully . It is impossible to say who suggested the theme and who developed it ( as Papa explained ) , but all the world could see the theme was one of happiness and friendship . Believe me , in a few days they were making music together as if they had studied at the same conservatory . At the end of one of their best duets , Papa said : " This bird has possibilities . " My mother shook her head in despair . " I suppose , soon , you will wish to go on the Keith vaudeville circuit with him . " " Her , " said my father . " Moi , aussi , " I said eagerly . " Papa , Mary Garden and me , making songs , dances , and funny sayings with eight beautiful girls , eight ! "  | " You , " my mother said , " go and brush the hair off your eyes . When you go in vaudeville it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spank you . " Then came the news that Mlle Charbon had indeed lost a canary . Naturally , an alarm had been sent out long ago , but somehow we had taken care not to hear it . Once at the table , after Mlle Charbon had visited my uncles , I said : " Mlle Charbon spoke today about a missing canary . " The way Papa looked at me over the escargots was enough . But , on a certain morning , Maman could not resist the temptation to compare the redness of her geraniums with those of the witch . Maman made the best apple pies in Lower Town ; her clothes on the line were the whitest ; her tomatoes and cucumbers were the largest ; but when it came to geraniums , Mlle Charbon had always the best . Mlle Charbon said : " You hear about it , eh ? " " About what ? " " About the bird ? " " Bird ? " my mother repeated . " But of course ! The canary . The great singer . Like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sing very much like a lark . " " This bird , " I inquired blandly , " what did it look like ? " " Look like ? " said Mlle Charbon . " Mon Dieu ! Like a canary , of course . With feathers of yellow and a beak . What else ? The Boy is sometimes not very bright , eh ? " " He spends too much time with his uncles , " Maman explained pointedly . " Especially Louis . " " Louis , " Mlle Charbon said , " is a fine specimen . " My mother shrugged and started to leave , after a glance at the witch 's geraniums . The geraniums were just a shade better than ours .  | Mlle Charbon stopped Maman . " This canary of which I speak left the cage and flew out the window some time ago . You will not believe me but often at night when I visit next door to you I believe I hear the bird singing . " C'est impossible , " I announced . " What you hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a nightingale ? " the witch inquired . " Stuffed , " I added . " Name of a name , a stuffed nightingale does not sing . " " But yes , " I insisted . " Inside this nightingale is a music box . " Mlle Charbon looked at me as if I were mad . " The Boy , " she said , " does not drink enough milk , perhaps , eh ? " Later , after an expansive meal of boeuf roulade ( which my mother cooked so that one had to hurry it to one 's mouth for fear it would melt on the fork ) and a bischof each ( warmer , spicier , and even more violet than the bishop 's robe ) , Maman said sol-emnly : " We must face it . The canary is Mlle Charbon 's . " My father ignored her . " I understand , " he noted casually , " that at the Experimental Farm they have made a new type of geranium which is the most red yet known . You should get some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beef , and with a violet spot on his necktie . " It would make me very sad to lose Mary Garden now , " I said . She is like one of us . " " For years , " Maman explained , " Mlle Charbon and I have been neighbors . True , she smokes cigars and has a glass eye , but her heart is kind . We have shared butter and sugar and garlic . I  | have made her ham baked in Burgundy and she has made for Uncle Louis onion soup au gratin . Something which he very often needs . Is a canary so much ? " My father raised his fork aloft . " Is a living canary , who sings , less important than onion soup , which is dead ? " He lowered the fork and wiped his lips slowly with the heavy serviette , rolling and returning it deliberately to the bright silver ring marked : Papa . " Uncle Felix , " Papa continued , " will tell you that in science many things happen simultaneously which are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Felix , " my mother remarked irrelevantly , " has gone to the theater . " " To the Casino Burlesque with Uncle Desmonde , " I added . " To collect more garters with roses on them . " " Not at the table , " Maman said . " And remove your elbows ! " " The canary , " Papa returned to the subject , " is the question . Now , there is no proof that Mary Garden belongs to Mlle Charbon . Mlle Charbon has lost a canary . We have found one . Does the bird answer to a name when one calls it ? Does it have a mole on the left leg ? Or a birthmark like a gooseberry ? " " I have one of a strawberry , " I said proudly . My father laughed . " We know without doubt to whom you belong , " he said . " It is the canary that bothers your dear Maman . Consider , I beg of you , the injustice of giving to Mlle Charbon a bird who is happy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mlle Charbon 's small mustache and glass eye . A songbird under such circumstances might easily lose its voice . " Papa 's speech had become as vibrant as that of a great orator . " Bravo ! " I cried . " Down with Mlle Charbon ! Vive la canary ! "  | My father sipped happily on his gloria , relishing the black coffee and the wain cognac . " Mes amis , " he said , " the bird is , I repeat , a free agent . She may go to Mlle Charbon if she chooses . Perhaps she does not like our cooking or our conversation . Eh bien . Let her go to Mlle Charbon . On the other hand , if we please her , let her remain and partake of our hospitality and friendship . It is up to the canary . Nothing could be more impartial ! " He patted himself twice under the chin with the back of his hand and retired to his room for an unscheduled duet with Mary Garden . It was one of the finest we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was exquisite . In the fall , alas , Mary Garden left us . She merely disappeared . Papa said nothing . He continued to play by himself , hoping he might lure the bird back . After a time my mother said : " If I was sure the bird would not return I would take the kitten from Aunt Felice . I must ask Mlle Charbon if the canary has come back to her . At the same time I will bring her some maple sugar . " " It is not our business what has happened to the canary , " Papa said . " It has come when it wanted to , it has gone where it wanted to , and it has done what it wanted to . If you wish , you may get the kitten . " Maman returned from Mlle Charbon 's with a quart of tomato relish and said : " Mary Garden is not at Mlle Charbon 's . She has a new canary . A sad one with a missing eye and a bent leg . It is of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In the last part of the month we found a dead canary on the back porch . We called Papa . He came from his room and looked at the bird without emotion .  | " Yes , " he said quietly , " that is Mary Garden . She was alive and bright and singing . . . now she is dead . Dead . . . but she lived fully . She had good food , good friends , and good music . Who has had more ? " My father went to his room and played a small , birdlike version of the Chopin funeral march while Maman and I buried the canary . The next day we got the kitten from Aunt Felice . When my father started to play , the kitten began to hiss and squeak . " This kitten , " said Papa , " is beautiful , but that is not enough . She knows nothing whatever about music . I do not complain . I merely state an unfortunate fact . Let us hope she is , at least , useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be not even useful . She was , alas , truly afraid of mice . At one time , according to my father , someone must have stepped on the kitten 's tail when she saw a mouse . " So , " my father went on , " when she sees now a mouse she is afraid her tail will be stepped on . This is science . Ask Felix if you do not believe me . " I did not believe him and I spent many weeks trying to make Marie Antoinette brave , but she would not be brave . In time she became frightened even of me . Here , I lost my interest in kittens . Yvonne , in spite of Uncle Louis ' anger , spent most of her time now with Alfred , and having neither kitten nor Yvonne , I turned my attention once more to books . Books , I discovered shortly , had lost a great deal of their wonder . Since I had been out in the world having adventures , the reports of great deeds seemed insipid compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a restless longing for something new and exciting to come into my life , that I stopped one day at the magic many-colored glass and remained awhile to watch the world in its several aspects and to find , if possible , something wonderful to dream about . I had come to the green glass , the glass of spring and newness , when I saw , through it , a most beautiful woman coming along the street with Papa . I pressed my nose even closer against the glass , to make sure . Yes , it was true . She was beautiful and it was certainly Papa . Wetting my fingers with my lips , I hastened to stick down as much as possible the stray hairs that spoiled my manly beauty . I tugged up my long stockings until they were as firmly held as the tights of a troubadour . I straightened my tie and smoothed down my wide collar . As I finished , the door opened and Papa and the beautiful stranger went into the parlor . After a time my mother joined them with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening to them talk . From the conversation I gathered that the girl , whose name was Mignonette , was to be our maid for a while . Oho ! I thought happily . A new princess is come . The old princess is dead , long live the new one ! Papa , it seems , had come across her in the dressing room at the theater . She was crying . As with me , so it was with Papa . He was unable to resist a woman 's tears . She explained that the act which she was with no longer required the services of a chanteuse and she was stranded . At this time , Maman had had an attack of rheumatism , and hearing Mignonette 's sad tale , Papa had conceived the idea of causing two birds to sing with the same food . Mignonette would stay with us for a while , doing a little  | housework for which we would pay her . In time she could save a little money . If not , at least she would be in a wholesome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and courage and strengthen her to face the world again . " However , " I heard Papa say as he left Maman and Mignonette together , " we must keep the uncles out of here . Especially Desmonde . " He came out of the parlor and nearly fell over me on the stairs . " Is this where you take your nap now ? " he asked . " I was thinking , " I said . " A man who thinks in the middle of the stairs will think in the middle of the street . A man who thinks in the middle of the street will be run over by the horses of the brewery wagons . Do you wish to be run over by horses ? " " Mais non , Papa ! " " Bien . Then do not think on the stairs . " When he had stepped over me and gone to his room I went down to the parlor to see my new princess . Mignonette , I could see at a glance , was born to cause all the trouble one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ten at the time and even I could see that . Not that she was at all slinky and pale and mysterious . On the contrary , she was warm and soft and sweet-smelling , with a bright smile and dark , flashing eyes . I had never in my life seen anything like Mignonette so close before . " This , " said Maman proudly , " is my little son . He is nervous and fragile and he studies too hard , but he is very good . We hope you will learn to love him . " " What a beautiful little boy ! " Mignonette exclaimed , heaving her bosom to such an extent I was practically forced back to the couch . She flung her arms around me and encompassed me with  | such warmth and softness that I was dizzy . Nevertheless , I made no protest . I would have gladly smothered to death then and there . I could think of no more pleasant way to die . Yvonne , I told myself , was never like this . " I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sigh . Then she kissed me . It was then the highly moral world which had been erected around me crumbled . I was lost , from that day on , to the forces of good . I did not know it , to be sure , but I was lost . And in spite of my nervousness and fragility , I thought whatever was happening  | was a considerable improvement on the Green Fairy-Tale Book or playing Waterloo with Uncle Louis . " Look ! " I shouted , beaming like a candle . " A player-piano ! " I took a roll from the pile and inserted it . Soon I was pumping furiously , to the best of my thin legs ' ability : I left my love in A-va-lon A-cross the-uh . . . bayyyyy .. . When I was halfway through , I became tired . " It is the same thing all over again , " I explained . " It is bee-oo-tee-ful ! " Mignonette said . Everything , I soon found out , was " bee-oo-tee-ful ! " to Mignonette  --  warm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps , to the fact that Mignonette was an orphan . She was so happy to be in a bright , well-arranged home after having lived so long on trains and in hotel rooms that the world turned suddenly pink for her  --  as pink as through that fragment of the many-colored glass . Little did she know her fate . Little did I know that my profound and disturbing love for her would be the cause of it . It was , indeed , from dear Mignonette that I learned how easily we may unthinkingly hurt those we love most . " You will have to sleep in the parlor , " my mother explained to her . " We also , " I interrupted , pointing to the pile of piano rolls , " have Tales from the Vienna Wood , which is very hard on the legs . And American Patrol and In a Monastery Garden , also bad for the legs . And Whispering , Stumbling , I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate , Alouette , and My Wonderful One ! "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Mignonette . She widened her lovely eyes in astonishment , and her face dimpled in many places with merriment . A thought flashed from nowhere into my mind , as if placed there by the Devil : I wonder is she like that all over ? " Something the matter ? " my mother solemnly asked Mignonette . " No , " Mignonette hastened to assure her . " Nothing . " My mother turned to me . " You must n't interrupt your elders , " she said . " Did you wash your face this afternoon ? " " Of course , " I said , as if the question were unnecessary . Maman looked down at my stockings . They were in perfect position . She looked up at my hair . It was well slicked . She smiled , slightly puzzled . Then she turned to Mignonette and explained how the couch was really a folding bed and so on . Mignonette kept glancing over Maman 's shoulder at me . She must have been bewildered . I certainly was . I had not the slightest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , it was welcome . I sat there calmly on a chair , my legs scarcely touching the floor . With my tweed pants , long black stockings , patent-leather shoes , and wide collar , I did not look at all like the Valentino type . One would never have suspected I was dangerous . How was poor Mignonette to know I was the sly , insidious sort who bides his time and strikes gently but with incisive thoroughness ? How , as a matter of fact , was I to know ? Mignonette proved to be a darling in every way and a great help to Maman . Fortunately , too , the uncles were off on another business trip and so Mignonette was not disturbed by them . She was free to devote her time to taking most of the cares off poor Maman 's aching shoulders . Mignonette cooked the most piquant of French dishes . She  | could even make fine cr  --  pes Suzette , deftly dropping in each one of the four extracts at precisely the right second , and having the batter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as white as if they had floated down from the clouds . She made rich fudge continually and fed it to me constantly . It seemed as if every hour of every day I was sidling up cozily to the warm breadth of her , carefully working my wiles , until I had fished from her apron pocket that dreamlike candy . So Mignonette  --  she fed me and she kissed me . Does any man need more ? She even took me to the cinema . This was when she had been with us a week or two . It was , in a way , the beginning of her downfall . Up to the point where we saw Valentino in The Son of the Sheik my affair with Mignonette was technically Platonic . It was compounded of music and laughter and hugs and kisses and chocolate fudge . Valentino turned the tide . Together we watched him cast his suave spell over Vilma Banky . Mignonette held my hand and squeezed it tightly with each passionate kiss the swarthy romantic bestowed on an assortment of lovelies . The tinny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Araby , and I realized suddenly that Mignonette and I were in love . Mignonette with Valentino ; I , with Mignonette . When I say I was in love I choose my words carefully . The flash of wondering whether Mignonette dimpled all over , as her face did , developed abruptly into a strong desire to see her with her clothes off , dimples or no dimples . Valentino , I was certain from the picture , had possessed exactly the same desire regarding Vilma Banky . We were now men together , Rudolph and I. Later , in the silence of my room , I pondered this new development .  | I was , of course , too shy to request Mignonette 's formal permission to be present some night while she disrobed . I could hardly ask my mother to act as envoy , since she would have considered me doomed to the Presbyterian hell of which I often dreamed when I went to bed too full of Mignonette 's fudge . The request would probably also have made poor Maman 's rheumatism worse . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The best I could expect from him ( or from my uncles ) was a request to join me . This spectacle of which I dreamed , I felt instinctively , was one that required the utmost privacy and mutual understanding . It was a dream , believe me , I did not wish to share with anyone . There was nothing unpleasant in any sense about my desire .  | I was not sure the Lord , or Maman or Papa , would understand , but that did not make it wrong . There were many things the three of them did not seem to understand . I had come naturally and without complications to my dream . I was simply curious . I wanted to know exactly how Mignonette looked without her clothes on , and there was no one to blame but Valentino . At length I hit upon an excellent idea . I decided to hide Mignonette 's nightgown . My logic was as simple as my desires . If she had no nightgown , she would have to walk around naked . Then I could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this na  --  ve conclusion . A man in love does not think very clearly , especially when he is beginning an adventure in which he does not know where he is going or what he will discover when he arrives . It was not difficult to secure Mignonette 's bulky flannelette nightgown . I simply took it from her closet and scurried up to my room with it . The only place I could think to hide it was under the mattress . This I did . That night I strode expectantly up and down outside the front room , on tiptoe , long after the others had gone to sleep . Mignonette , alas , did not appear in all her naked beauty . She had , of course , another nightgown . This one , too , I stole . She had still another , and another , and another . All these I also stole . At long last Mignonette ran out of nightgowns . At dinner that day she said : " It is strange but somebody has stolen all of my nightgowns . I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Papa laughed . " Who among us is a thief of nightgowns ? " " Maybe Uncle Desmonde , " I suggested nervously , making a burial mound with my butter knife patting the mashed potatoes .  | " Do n't play with your food , " Maman warned . I put the knife carelessly in my fruit compote . " Uncle Desmonde , " I went on , " is always saving garters with flowers on them from the girls who throw them from the stage of the Casino Burlesque . Also from other places . If a man will save garters he will save also nightgowns . No ? " " No , " said my father promptly . " Do we have to discuss it at the table ? " Maman inquired . " Each day a different one is gone , " Mignonette said plaintively , ignoring Maman . " Maybe the man who brings the ice ? " Papa said . " Yes , " I agreed eagerly . " To me he looks like a thief . He has a mustache , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " would the iceman be doing in the parlor ? And is a man a thief because he has a mus-tache ? " " Always in the cinema , " I said , " the one with the mustache is the thief . " " I suppose , " my father said to my mother , " the nightgowns arise by themselves and float away like angels ? " " Well , let us forget it , " Mignonette said . " Perhaps I am crazy or something . " " It could be ghosts , " I ventured . Several days later , Maman was making my bed . I pretended to be absorbed in the Boys ' Own Paper . " Viens ' ci , " my mother ordered . " Help me turn over the mat-tress ! " I shut the B.O.P. with a thud . " Turn ? " I repeated in a daze . " Turn . Certainly . Turn . T-u-r-n . Take hold of this end . "  | " Maman , " I begged with great concern , " you are going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donc ! " Maman cried impatiently . " Take hold here . " " Why , " I asked , " does a mattress have to be turned over ? Is one side different ? " My mother sighed in exasperation . " You will drive me to Brockville ! " she said . " What 's at Brockville ? " I asked interestedly , hoping we might get on to a new subject . " The crazy house , " Maman replied . " Oho ! " I laughed altogether too loudly . " If Uncle Louis and Uncle Felix and Uncle Desmonde are safe , we , too , are safe , no ? Haha ! " " Take hold , " my mother said icily . " Why is the crazy house at Brockville ? " I went on desperately . " Why not Renfrew ? Or Ganonoqu ? ? " " Take hold ! " Maman commanded . " If somebody asked me , " I shrugged , " I would say it does not make any difference if a mattress is one way or the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at me with tightly pressed lips . " Do you , " she asked deliberately , " want me to take the hairbrush to you ? " So I took hold of the mattress and we turned it over . There we discovered , not to my surprise , a large collection of flannelette nightgowns . My mother swayed a bit . She stared me straight in the eye . I did not flinch . " It makes it softer , " I explained with a foolish smile . My mother 's mouth flattened into a long , thin , sad line . She gathered the nightgowns in her arms and took them downstairs without another word .  | The next day I heard my bee-oo-tee-ful Mignonette saying good-by . My mother was explaining things to her . I crept down on the landing of the stair and listened . " Only a child  --  you understand , " she said . " Sorry to have you eave ... very nervous boy . . . impressionable ... too old for his ears . . . women upset him . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The door then closed behind Mignonette , and I cried a little nd looked through the blue piece of the many-colored glass and atched my Mignonette disappear in a night of my own making . I was not , however , sorry for what I had done . I had been riven , I understood , by a superior force : my heart . I regretted only that it had turned out the way it had . I hoped Maman had paid Mignonette enough so she would be safe and happy wherever she had gone without me . " When I am a man , " I told myself , " I will give her a nightgown of spun gold for her birthday  --  also a kiss . " Maman and Papa did not ever directly mention the matter to me . Once I heard it discussed . Maman said perhaps I was not paying enough attention to my Sunday-school lessons or maybe Uncle Desmonde was corrupting me . Papa said it could be I stole the nightgowns to sell and would it not be wise to give me a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true explanation , the simplest of all . Or , if they did , they were too delicate to mention it . I wish they had . There were many , many points I should like to have had cleared up . Only once did Papa ever say anything to me  --  and all he said was : " In the cinema sometimes the villains do not have mustaches , eh ? Sometimes they are too young . "  | My Friend the Mouse I was so lonely after Mignonette 's departure that I made a friend of a mouse . I had never known a mouse before , and this new comradeship proved very educational . It came about in this manner . Taking shortbreads to bed to keep under my pillow and munch while I read the many FairyTale Books , the Boys ' Own Paper , and an infrequent Frank Merriwell was forbidden . Shortbreads under the pillow , however , came in the third degree of forbidden things . The degrees were as follows : First : Those things I was told not to do and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was told not to do and did only under special dispensation . Third : Those things I was forbidden to do but which I did anyway because I knew Maman expected me to do them and that her only interest in the matter was that of keeping her conscience clear and her record with the Lord straight . So , in spite of the injunction against it , I took shortbreads to  | bed . I would stay about the kitchen until no one was looking and , while the others were busy in the dining room , sipping their bischofs and glorias and Pernods , I would plunge my hand deep into the jar and emerge from the kitchen , shortbreads stuffed into my blouse , and kiss my mother good night . If Uncle Desmonde was present he would remark slyly : " My , how the Boy is becoming fat around the waist , eh ? " Maman , who was afraid shortbreads in bed would give me bad dreams and leave crumbs all over , would mutter : " What in the world have you stuffed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeat . " Stuffed ? Good night , Maman dear . I am very tired . I do not wish to talk too much . " Nearly always , in this manner or some other , I managed to get to my bedroom with the shortbreads intact and without having told a direct lie . This was another unspoken arrangement I had with the Lord and Maman at that time . If I were asked a direct question to which the answer was " yes " or " no , " I was bound to answer the truth . If , on the other hand , the question permitted indirect replies I was permitted to use as much ingenuity as possible . This not only allowed us to avoid much unhappiness , but it also aided in sharpening my wits . Thus it came about that I stored shortbreads regularly under my pillow in spite of the bad dreams and the crumbs . What neither Maman nor I had thought of was The Mouse . It is necessary to call him The Mouse because he is the only mouse who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love and friendship than from Yvonne or Mignonette . I also learned a sad lesson in loyalty from The Mouse . In fact , by my rigid standards of mice and men , The Mouse emerges as a true hero . He was , perhaps , a gentleman mouse and not a lady mouse , although I can not be certain .  | The Mouse , I discovered , was , in some fashion , edging his way up my bed and under my pillow to gnaw on shortbreads while I slept . In the morning when I awoke I would often find but one shortbread where I had left two . I thought for a time it might be another example of the magic I was constantly almost meeting . It turned out not to be so . It turned out to be The Mouse . I discovered him by slipping my hand under the pillow one morning and finding him there having a late supper or an early breakfast . He squirmed away from me and disappeared , a swift gray streak . I was sorry to see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to teach me to fear mice . ( She had not , I suppose , had the mice either . ) This mouse I wished to remain with me so that I might have him for a pet and perhaps train him as Uncle Louis had once trained a crow . Immediately and fervently I asked the Lord to make it so that no one would discover The Mouse and set a trap . Once more the Lord ignored me , for Papa entered my room one night and saw The Mouse . The Mouse rarely made an appearance under electric lights . He seemed to be of the retiring , modest type . This time , however , he was , I imagine , lonelier than usual . And hungrier . " What was that ? " Papa said . " Hein ? " as a gray streak flashed across the room . " Qu'est-ce que c'est ? " I said na  --  vely . " What was that which just now appeared and disappeared ? " " I saw nothing . Uncle Louis , you know , often sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see is there , " Papa replied with dignity . " Me , I saw nothing , " I persisted . " You promised to fix my  | skates . I would not like to play hockey with a bad skate . I will limp like a lark with a broken leg . " My father frowned at me and sat down slowly on the side of the bed . He began to work at the strap on the ankle support of my skating boot . In a few moments he suddenly arose with a bad light in his eyes . He tossed the boot onto the bed and looked at me as if he were a witch about to turn me into a cabbage . Papa was no longer a good , kind man with music in his heart and in his fingers ; he was now , I could see , a fierce hunter . He had discovered the doorway to The Mouse 's home . It was a very small hole near the corner of the room . " Oho ! " he shouted like a savage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You have not fixed my boot . " " Aha ! " Papa exclaimed . He kneeled down and peeked into The Mouse 's home . Do n't let him kill The Mouse , You understand ? I demanded silently of the Lord . Fair is fair . I have learned already twice the number of Bible verses I am supposed to learn and You have hardly noticed me at all . Papa is Papa and I love and respect him , but You know and I know The Mouse is my friend . This was the first time I had ever given the Lord orders , and I was not so sure I had used the most politic method . I tried now to engage my father in conversation . " What do you think I learned in school today ? " I asked eagerly . My father replied without looking up : " Very little , no doubt . And that little of more harm than good . " I persisted . " I learned many things . Can you guess some ? " " In school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are either one figure or another , and that , in the end , it does not matter which . "  | " We learn other things but dates , " I rallied . Papa was now poking his nose in The Mouse 's house . " You learn , if you are smart , that brushes banged together cause chalk dust to penetrate the lungs , which is why teachers never clean the blackboard brush  --  s themselves . " " Me , " I replied smugly and untruthfully , " I like to clean the brushes . It is good exercise and keeps you in the air and sun . " " You , " said Papa , " are not normal . " I tried hard to think of something else to talk about when suddenly Papa jumped up , holding his nose , and cried : " Sacrebleu . Nom d'un nom ! Sacr  --  e vache ! " The Mouse apparently had scratched Papa 's long nose . I could not help but laugh . " You , too , would be angry if someone sticks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papa rubbed his nose and came back to the bed , a little confused . He began to repair the boot once more , and I sighed happily , thinking he had abandoned his wild-game hunt . Perhaps he had , but The Mouse had not given up Papa . Foolish Mouse ! As soon as my father became comfortably seated on the bed , The Mouse walked right out . Not only did he walk out ; he stood up on two legs and looked my father calmly in the eye . It was as if he wished to say : " Look here , I did not mean to hurt your nose . It was an accident . The Boy and I are friends . It is not easy to find a true friend in this world . For a small boy it is difficult ; for a mouse it is almost impossible . Can we not talk this over , man to man ? " Alas , my poor father , who understood so many lovely things so very well , did not understand The Mouse . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Mouse , who apparently knew something of human nature , was intelligent enough to disappear .  | The next day there was a trap with some cheese . I stole the cheese in the name of my friendship with The Mouse . I could not do otherwise . The following day , Papa , seeing neither cheese nor mouse , remarked pointedly : " Aha ! What a remarkable mouse it is we have here , eh ? " " Pourquoi ? What is so wonderful about The Mouse ? " " He eats the cheese and yet he does not spring the trap ! " I rolled my eyes and tried to look as much as possible like a cherub in the Sunday-school pictures . " Such a thing is possible  --  for a very smart mouse . " Papa looked me in the eye . " Do you try to tell me The Mouse removes the cheese from the trap without catching himself ? " " I said only that it was possible . I do not see him do it . " " It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Many strange things happen in the world . Did you know a whale is like a cow ? " " A whale is not like a cow . A cow does not swim . The spiders are making webs in your attic . " " Ah , so , " I countered . " The spiders are eating the cheese from the trap . It is possible . " " What is most possible , " Papa said sternly , " is that a small boy with a vacant head is removing the cheese from the trap . " " What small boy would do such a thing ? " I inquired . " You will find him in the minor , " said Papa . He forbade me , after that , to touch the cheese . It was a direct command of the first degree and had to be obeyed . Once more I prayed for The Mouse . " Dear Lord , " I said . " I have saved The Mouse once . What I can do , certainly You can do . If the worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temptation of the cheese . Lead him  | not into temptation , but deliver him from the evil trap . I will repay You . " Nevertheless , I awaited , with terror in my heart , the end of mon ami , ? toute ? preuve . Well , had he not risked his life to bargain with Papa for my friendship ? Had The Mouse not then proven his loyalty ? As if in answer to my prayers , the painters arrived the next day to do my room . Good , I thought ; it will give The Mouse a chance to make other plans . Meanwhile it offered an opportunity for a round-table discussion of the matter . I opened the subject with Maman : " If you have a friend whose loyalty is proven ? ? toute ? preuve , comprends-tu ? ? you stand by this friend when others wish him harm . N'est-ce pas ? " My mother was working a large gourd into one of Papa 's socks . " Mais oui , " she replied . " Aha ! " I shouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Mouse ? " My mother opened her eyes wide and stood up quickly . " Mouse ? " she repeated nervously . " What mouse ? Where is The Mouse ? " Papa sipped his wine and put down his newspaper , Le Droit . He looked at me across the room with a wise smile . I could see I had made a fatal strategic error . Maman was afraid of mice . " The Boy , " my father said quietly , " has in his room a mouse . They are friends , these two . So the Boy claims . The Mouse has said nothing . " " Set the trap ! " cried Maman . " Set the trap ! " " The trap , " Papa explained , " will be set when the painters are finished . We do not wish to catch a painter , you know . " " Why was the trap not set before ? " Maman inquired . " The trap was set before , " my father explained patiently , " but  | The Mouse removed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " my mother insisted . " Non . C'est possible . C'est vrai , " I defended . " Va donc ! " Maman said , dismissing my theory . " I forbid you to remove the cheese . You understand ? " " I will not remove the cheese , " I promised sadly . " But it is only a coward who stands still while his best friend is killed with low tricks . " " Listen to him sing ! " Papa exclaimed , a little upset . " Maman herself has said this is one of the things one does not do , " I argued . " A mouse , " my mother countered , " is different . " " A friend is a friend , " I said . " At least , if you wish to fight my friend you could fight fair  --  not with traps . " " Ho ! Name of a thousand and one names ! " Papa cried . " Shall I make a tail for myself and get down on my hands and knees and bite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could see it was no use . The Mouse could be saved now only by the good Lord , and I did not trust even Him any too much . He had disappointed me too often . When the painters came down , one of them said : " I say , there 's a mouse in the lad 's room . " " Nervy little tyke , too , " said the other painter . " Come right out and looked us over , ' e did . " " Slimy if ' e did n't ! " said the first . When they went out , I said eagerly : " You see , even the English , who are known to die without making faces , think The Mouse is brave . " " The English , " Papa said dryly , " are brave because they have no blood . " Then he went upstairs and set the trap with an unfairly large and unusually attractive piece of cheese . Later , when I kneeled to say my prayers , I requested the Lord  | to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cheese . Tell The Mouse , I suggested , that it is the Devil 's own cheese . I went to sleep with a little more confidence in the Lord this time , since , after all , I had even suggested an approach . When I awakened in the morning the cheese was still there . I jumped out of bed , kneeled down , and told the Lord : " Merci bien , Monsieur ! " Then I dressed and bounded joyfully down to breakfast , humming gaily : " O Canada ! " I ate my oatmeal in bliss . Just as I had finished , there was a scampering above us . " Is that , " Papa asked , " perhaps , The Mouse ? " I held my breath and prayed one more time . Maman was busy making toast and said nothing . In a few moments there was scampering again . This time it seemed very close . " Does The Mouse know even the way downstairs ? " Papa asked in surprise . I did not answer him . I busied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed me . I did not wish to think . Halfway through the toast I felt as if something soft had touched my feet . I looked down . There was The Mouse , reeling , wobbling , struggling toward my feet . When he saw my friend , my father stood up hastily . I do not know what he intended to do  --  perhaps protect Maman . It does not matter . In a few seconds The Mouse rolled over at my feet , dead . He did not die , however , before he had said something to me with his eyes . My father rushed upstairs and came back excitedly , exclaiming :  | " Astonishing ! The cheese was removed from the trap . One imagines the trap then sprung and struck The Mouse in the jaw . Imagine it , this is a mouse who has died from a punch in the jaw ! " The wonder of it did not impress me . I knew The Mouse was a brave one . But I did not know about myself , for , with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Look , I was your friend and you have killed me . But here is the wonder  --  I am still your friend . See , I come to die at your feet and to forgive you . It is easy to love those who are kind to you ; it is a terrible but necessary thing to love those who betray you . Ah , perhaps The Mouse did not mean anything of the sort . Maybe it was my own heart speaking , learning , growing up . " Papa , " I asked quietly , " is there a heaven for The Mouse ? " " Yes , yes , " Papa said sadly and a little unhappily , " there is for everyone a heaven . Maman , who had been white and silent through the tragedy , now spoke meekly : " After this , let us return to Felice the kitten and take instead the large cat , so that such matters will be out of our hands . "  | Father Sebastian Father Sebastian was a man I always observed with wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain , yet I could not reconcile his piety with the inordinate amount of wine and glac  --  s cakes he could cause to vanish from the top of our redfringed tablecloth . Often I had seen him , sit in our parlor eating grape by grape from the fruit bowl , whole clusters disappearing as I pumped wearily on the pianola , Father Sebastian humming and nodding his head in time to my footsore rendition of Avalon . And then again I had seen him in other lights when his round , red cheeks were aglow with sanctimonious wonder and his eyes alight with reverence and awe , candles flickering divinely about  | him and the hypnotic flow of Latin coming from his thick lips like honey from a red jar . He was a riddle to me . He was neither mad and lusty like my uncles ; nor calm , witty , and wise like my father ; nor gentle and trusting in the canny Scotch way of my mother . He came to see us one day when we were all drinking wine in the parlor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , announced : " I will build a new church . " My father gave him a look of surprise . " It will be necessary to tear down the old church , which is so full of drafts even the angels must sneeze in the winter . " " To tear down a church is to have another half built , " Uncle Louis said . " The present church remains intact . If the angels object to the drafts , then they must send us sturdier angels . Those who make a church too comfortable encourage lassitude and luxury . " Having said this , Father Sebastian helped himself to cold frogs ' legs , more iced grapes , and some Burgundy . " This new church . . . the diocese . . . " my father began . " The new church is my own idea . A personal church . A church within a church , one might say . A chapel so intimate only a few close friends may attend on especially lovely spring and autumn days . " Uncle Louis , who had often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sebastian with wonder in his red-stained eyes . " The Bishop will have words to say , and he will say them not to your whiskers but behind your back . " Father Sebastian waved a graceful hand . " When my father left me a choice wine cellar the Bishop sued and broke the will by trickery . He convinced a biased jury that  | what was mine belonged to the True Church . He later proved that what belonged to the Church belonged to his cellar . It is true he often invites me to drink my own wine . But that is the least he could do under the circumstances . " " The very least , " said Uncle Louis sagely . " Then , " my father said worriedly , " the new church is to show the Bishop you are not yet beaten , that he may have the choicest angels on his side but that you have the strongest ? " " That is not the way I would put it , " Father Sebastian said , . gently removing the seeds of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather , that I wish to build a church with my own hands and those of my friends to show the Bishop that the work of the lowest level of labor is necessary to bring forth a true place of worship and that the stained glass and the wine are wrought not with lawsuits but with strength and faith and , if I am not being indelicate , sweat . " " You are not being indelicate , " Uncle Louis said , nodding his head and wiping wine from his lips with a deft flick of the edge of the tablecloth . Father Sebastian arose . " Are you with me ? " he asked . " We are with you , " my father and Uncle Louis said together . Where Father Sebastian got the bricks , the mortar , the ladders , and such , we did not know . He was much loved in his parish , and we supposed they were gifts . At any rate , the weird structure began slowly to rise . I say weird because Father Sebastian scoffed at the idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisdom , has no plan , as far as I can judge . So why should I ? "  | There was , my father , Louis , and several others agreed , much sense in Father Sebastian 's remark . ' What , " asked Uncle Louis , " will be the joy if we know before we start what the end will be ? " " Yes , " my father said . " It is a little like a painter of still lifes 1 new . He arranged his models so well that he could say afterwards , with a shrug , What is the use of painting them ? ' " The church took form after a time and over the protests of the Bishop , who insisted Father Sebastian was causing a split in the Church . " The Church , " Father Sebastian confided to us , " is too strong to split . The Bishop , on the other hand , is not . " There was justice in this observation , for the Bishop often drove by in his limousine and , sticking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shout : " This is a work of Evil ! " One could see he was about to burst . One could see , too , that Father Sebastian stood on very shaky ground , almost as shaky as that on which the new edifice rose . It was only the deep love of his parishioners for the Father that made the Bishop hesitate to punish the imaginative divine . One day the church was completed . It was made of all sorts of bricks and stones all of different shapes and colors , which , by some miracle of light and shade , blended into a pleasant pattern . This gay and curious house of worship had only one room . On top of this room a wooden steeple had been built . The walls of the church buckled a bit , but they were firmly propped with stiff wooden planks . The floor was uneven , and beads dropped from a rosary would roll around in semicircles . There was a bell in the steeple . It was a little too heavy for that section , and Father Sebastian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fear of shaking the top off his church .  | The whole thing , at a short distance , looked like something made in a French confectioner 's when the pastry man was glowing with wine and anxious to try some new and loving tricks with the icing squirter . One Sunday we stood before the Father 's completed church , all of us who had helped to build it . Father Sebastian offered a short prayer of thanks to the Lord for helping us with this tribute to Him which we had fashioned with our bare hands . It was very moving . " This church stands on a sinking foundation , O Lord , " Father Sebastian intoned . " But it is made of gifts from small , poor people lacking in material wealth but big in heart and rich in spirit through Thy grace . It has been put together with joy and laughter and not much consideration , I am afraid , for the principles of good architecture or the laws of gravity . Still , we who have sweated to build it are proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miracles . We have also enjoyed ourselves worshiping Thee . This is something frequently lost sight of in the True Church . If our tribute should fall down in the next windstorm our faith will not be shaken . This house of loving worship was not builded as the pagans build , to last for centuries . Let us learn that Thy will is an ever-changing , ever-creating , everrenewing one and that inertia is death . Amen . " That lovely Sunday Father Sebastian preached to a congregation of twenty-two persons , all of whom had built the church . The Father spoke of love and tolerance and work and beauty . He spoke , in conclusion , of the need for more joy in worshiping God . " The Lord also chuckles , " was his final observation . We all left together for a great banquet that day and roundly toasted Father Sebastian in his absence .  | " He is the first religious man I have ever known who puts happiness before piety , " my father said . " He is the only religious man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made for man and not man for religion . " " He is so wise and tolerant and tender , " said my mother , " that he should have been a Presbyterian . " The fact that Father Sebastian was ordered by the Bishop to enter a monastery for several months and repent did not in any way affect our happiness . We knew that the good Father needed a rest and we knew , too , that where he had gone they made some of the best cordials in the world . Before he left , however , Father Sebastian warned us to stay away from the church on windy days . " It was built , remember , " he said , " with great love but with little mortar . " His advice was good , for , alas , one early autumn day a sixtymile-an-hour gale , whirling down through the Laurentians , toppled over the church that love and sweat built . When Father Sebastian heard of this he sent us a note : Be of good cheer . The church we have built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have built in our hearts will be with us forever . We are now working on a new type of cordial which may rival France 's superb cognac . God bless you all . Father Sebastian  | The Enormous Easter Egg Mrs. Merryweather must not be neglected in the list of women who early conditioned me to confusion . She moved into the big house behind our yard , and we were all very curious . Papa thought that she must have at least one empty room in her head , because of the strange clothes she wore . She wore hats as large as Maman 's white parasol . She wore dresses so full , Maman remarked : " I could make a whole wardrobe for myself from one dress of hers . Not to mention the petti-coats ! " Mrs. Merryweather also wore high , buttoned shoes of a bright red color . Her face , too , was colored like those of the girls on the stage at the theater where Papa played . Only , the girls were young and it did not look the same on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that my new neighbor was a widow whose husband had left her considerable money .  | " One could pile it , believe me , " exclaimed Uncle Felix one day , " as high as the turret of the Ch  --  teau Laurier ! " " If one could obtain it , " Desmonde amended . Desmonde , alas , had been rolling his eyes in Mme Merryweather 's direction , and she had not rolled hers back . This was , in truth , unusual , and Desmonde had decided she must be abnormal , perhaps afflicted with some strange malady which did not show , enveloped as she was in such a volume of cloth . Desmonde had even decided that her garters would not do for his collection , since they were probably undistinguished . In time it was further revealed that Mrs. Merryweather spent as little money as possible , in spite of her large fortune . My father said the shock of her husband 's death had unhinged her a bit . The husband , according to legend , had been a big-game hunter whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly orangutan . To me , however , all these data meant nothing . Mrs. Merryweather and I got along very well . It was always easy to get along with me . One had only to feed me . This Mrs. Merryweather did on many an afternoon . She would stick her head over the fence and call to me that afternoon tea was ready . Then she would serve one small scone and a half glass of lime juice . Never more , never less . " You are a nice boy , " was one of her conclusions . " You will not steal anything . " " Thou shalt not steal , " I said . " Ah , would that more of us remembered the Commandments , " Mrs. Merryweather said , pleased at my statement . I might have told her , but I did not , that I remembered the Commandments well because if I did not I would be denied the joy of the Sunday-school picnic and the pleasure of playing basketball during the week in the Sunday-school hall . The Reverend  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all , word for word , or one was adjudged a heretic , not fit for basketball or picnics . In a few days I discovered the reason for Mrs. Merryweather 's generosity . She wished me to run errands for her . At first I refused . " In the heat of the summer , " I explained tactfully , " Maman says it is not good for me to go long distances in the sun . " " The sun makes us healthy , " Mrs. Merryweather insisted . " Not me , " I said flatly . Mrs. Merryweather pondered awhile . It was obvious she was making a decision of great importance . " I will , " she said finally , and with an air of sadness she might have adopted had all her teeth been suddenly pulled , " give you ten cents for each errand . " I gasped . Ten cents ! And from Mrs. Merryweather ! Ha ! That was different . Allons , bon ! You see , my allowance was ten cents a week , and there was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had been there since Easter . It was , believe me , the egg of an elephant . It was enormous , and covered with small wigglings of pink sugar . At the front of this great egg was a window through which one could see the whole world . There were people walking in a street ; there were angels talking together ; there were small , pink cupids shooting arrows at a boy and girl ; there were many other wonders . One could look inside and make up stories for a long time . Afterwards one could eat the egg . It was the most wonderful thing I had ever seen , and I wanted it more than anything else in the world . I had spoken to Maman and Papa about this treasure , and they had told me I must save from my allowance if I wished to  | buy the egg , which cost two dollars and fifty cents , reduced from three dollars . If I spent nothing for six months , I calculated , I could save enough . Such a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sipped my lime juice slowly and said nothing when Mrs. Merryweather made her offer . I waited to see if she might by a miracle increase it to twelve cents . She did not . " Well ? " she asked impatiently . " I accept the offer , " I announced . " Let us shake hands . " We shook hands and the transaction was completed . I sighed happily and , as Mrs. Merryweather went to the garden to pick flowers , I examined her house . It was , truly , almost as beautiful and crazy as the world inside the enormous Easter egg . Everywhere you looked there were hatracks of all shapes and sizes . In one room there were seven . In the same room were four sideboards , one of them carved with life-size cupids  --  cupids biting on bunches of mahogany grapes . There was a large table with ten extra leaves piled on the floor like wood in the lumber yard down the street . There were two desks with roller tops . There were three bookcases all filled with dishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish , a stuffed owl , and a polar-bear rug . It was almost like the Central Canada Exhibition all in one room . " This Mrs. Merryweather , " I muttered as I went home , " belongs to the same collection as my uncle Louis . " I went to M. LaBelle 's shop one afternoon for some meat and vegetables When M. LaBelle heard for whom it was , he removed his ancient , broken straw hat , wiped his hands on his apron , clustered his fingers together , kissed them , and exclaimed :  | " Ah ! The bee-ooooo-tee-ful Madame Merryweath-er ! " M. LaBelle and I , by the way , seldom obtained any genuine exchange of ideas in conversation . M. LaBelle spoke a FrenchCanadian patois I did not comprehend . I spoke a jargon he certainly did not understand . His alleged " English " was " Yankee , " and he preferred it to anything else . It was way beyond me , for the most part . As I looked , for the twentieth time , at the egg with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Devil in holy water and chattered like a monkey . The gist of his monologue was that Mrs. Merryweather had visited his grocery several times . She had been forever fighting about the prices and the weights . It was true that M. LaBelle 's prices were high , but his son had just lost his job and it was only natural for M. LaBelle to raise the prices to meet the additional expense . " Why did you make high prices for her if you love her ? " I inquired casually , still sighing over the egg . " Ah , it was not teel la-ter that I understand she weel make some-bod-ee a marvelous wife ! You never ged no mon-ee from her unless you fight like a peeg ! Thees ees the im-por-tant thing to have in a wife . It is al-mose thee main , whole part ? No ? " I shrugged . " Why do n't you tell her ? She knows now only that you raise too high the price of pommes de terre . She does not know you wish her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. LaBelle , removing his tattered straw and scratching his head thoughtfully . " Ah . . . so . . . " he said suddenly . " Leesten . You see the beeg egg you weesh for so long time ? Hey ? Thees egg I weel geeve you gratis if you tell to Mrs. Merryweath-er that I love her forever so much I weel marry her even ! No ? " " Mais oui , " I agreed quickly . Mais oui !  | I gathered up my groceries and ran out , leaving M. LaBelle grinning and wiping his brow with his apron . When I returned to Mrs. Merryweather 's dark castle I talked of one thing and another for a while and then came to the point . " M. LaBelle , who is rich like anything , says you are the most beautiful of all the women , and he loves you forever , and he wishes to marry you . " I sat back , smugly confident . Mrs. Merryweather raised her eyes slowly . She looked like an angry tiger . I leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do not speak to me of M. LaBelle ! " Mrs. Merryweather said in a deep , hollow tone . " He winks at every pretty girl he sees ! " I laughed nervously . " Haha . You make yourself a mistake . " " He does not wink ? " Mrs. Merryweather was skeptical . " He winks , yes . " " Well ? " " He winks , " I said , " but not from love . Only from a nervousness in the eyes . He does not wear all the time his glasses . This makes the eyes weak . You understand ? " Mrs. Merryweather heaved her bosom . She tapped gently on the table for a while and then shrugged her shoulders with what seemed to me a studied indifference . " Even so , " she said , not too convincingly , " M. LaBelle thinks only of money . " " But . . . " Mrs. Merryweather waved her hand nervously . " Please , " she said , " I do not wish to discuss the matter . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalls to me , though , that I did not yet get the ten cents for the errand . " Mrs. Merryweather waved an admonishing finger and smiled as if she had tasted lemon on the tip of her tongue .  | " You must n't ask people for money , " she said . " You must wait until they give it to you . Otherwise people will think you are rude . " " I will wait , " I advised her . I waited an hour and she did not give me the money . Then I became hungry and went home . " Between M. LaBelle and Mrs. Merryweather , " I said to myself that night in my bedroom , " I am between the cave of the wolves and the cave of the robbers ! " Nevertheless , for many days I went on hopefully , bringing notes and flowers and once , even , a pound of eels from M. LaBelle to Mrs. Merryweather . Mrs. Merryweather began to be impressed . " Why , look ! " she exclaimed one day . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) " He has charged me nothing for the tomatoes and only half for the lime juice . Perhaps I am wrong about his character . " I was happy about this . In those days I was joyful to see others in the arms of the angels . I was even more joyful at the renewed prospect of obtaining the egg with the world inside it , gratis . On the other hand , I was also learning that there is nothing of which one can be really certain , so I demanded of Mrs. Merryweather , for the fifteenth time , my accumulation of ten cents 's . " I am saving them for you , " she replied , smiling like a row of piano keys . " Me , " I said resentfully , " I can save them , also . " Mrs. Merryweather waved her finger lightly . " Tut , tut . You will only spend them foolishly . On candy or something . " " Not me , " I insisted . " I will buy a book . " I thought this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , you wo n't . You 'll go into the first confectioner 's you find and buy something to eat . Little boys do not have much business sense . Especially French boys . No , I shall save the money for  | you , and when there is enough I shall surprise you . Perhaps I shall buy you some long underwear for the cold winter . " I groaned . " Madame , " I protested , " the bureaus of Maman are filled with long underwear . The closets are filled with long underwear . Under the beds are boxes with long underwear . I have no need for long underwear . " " Ah , well , something else more colorful , perhaps . Huh ? Some dancing pumps with black bows ? " Name of a name , I thought , perhaps I better shut my mouth or she will be buying me a box of soap ! I went back to M. LaBelle and informed him that Mrs. Merryweather had showed signs of interest . The grocer was exultant . He threw his straw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he failed to catch it and it landed in the barrel of dill pickles . " Ah , we will be happy like two pigeons ! " he exclaimed . " Of course , " I agreed . " More happy . And now , please , the egg . M. LaBelle hugged me pleasantly and smiled . " Ah , no ! " he replied . " The egg on the day of the marriage . We are businessmen , you and me , no ? " C'est la vie , I told myself wearily and went home , confused and angry . At night I lay in my bed and examined my position . Here was how I stood : The money I had earned running errands would be doubtlessly used to buy me some terrible garment for which I had no need or desire . The egg with the world inside it I would never get because probably Mrs. Merryweather would never marry M. LaBelle . It would also rain the day of the next Sunday-school picnic or  | I would be sick from too much ice cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hailstones , too . It was possible I would break a leg someday soon , playing basketball in the Sunday-school hall . Next year in school I would fail in everything and the teachers would beat me with a leather strap . " Of what use , " I muttered , " is living if I can not have anything I wish ? What is wrong with me ? Is it , perhaps , that I sin too much and have not spoken to the good Lord in some time ? " I reflected . I could think of no sins whatever . " Come , come , " I urged myself , " there must be some sins . Nobody has no sins . " I reflected again , but still I could discover no sins . " There is something very wrong here , " I told myself . " A boy with no sins is not treated in this manner . " I found no answer to the puzzle . For some time after that night I did not go to M. LaBelle 's or Mrs. Merryweather 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street that paid me in cash , five cents for each errand  --  in advance ! I was happy again . I was glad I had no sins . Soon , I would have money enough for the egg . At last it was all there in a bank in my room . With a knife , I slid the coins out , one by one , all the money I had earned from the drugstore errands . I counted it carefully , and when I was certain I had the required sum , I poured the coins into my pocket and raced for M. LaBelle 's , my coins shaking and jingling like glass chimes . When I reached the store , breathing like a rabbit , I was stunned to read a large sign on the door :  | CLOSED FOR THE HAPPY WEDDING ! COME BACK SOON AU ' VOIR ! I ran home in astonishment and anger . " Maman ! Papa ! " I shouted as soon as I came through the door . " Where is M. LaBelle ? For what is the wedding ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stopped peeling an apple . " You must be working very hard at the drugstore , " she said . My father , who was carefully shining his shoes , looked up and waved a brush at me : " All the world knows Mme Merryweather has been , every day , at the store of M. LaBelle . All the world knows , too , that they have gone to Montreal for the honeymoon . " He began to brush his shoes vigorously . " They will make a couple like gloves , " he added . " They are both so stingy . " " If they are in love , " Maman said gently , " perhaps it will open their hearts . " My father rubbed my head playfully . " Your mother has been reading your books of fairy tales , eh ? " he laughed . ' I was in no mood for jokes . I went sadly from the kitchen and walked wearily up the stairs to my room . There , I stretched out on the bed for a long time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man and then be able to lie to and cheat small boys . Nevertheless , I had not given up completely . I waited for M. LaBelle 's return as the robber waits behind the tree for the traveler.  | He returned at last , and I ran down to the grocery as soon as I heard the news . Before I went in I noticed the sign on the front had been changed . It now read : MERRYWEATHER &; LABELLE EPICERIE As I opened the door I heard the tinkle of a bell announce my entrance . I looked up at the bell in surprise and then at M. LaBelle , who stood behind the counter in a fresh , white apron . His old straw hat had been replaced , too , by a bright black-and-whitecheckered cap . He pointed to the little bell with pride . " My wife got the idea . If we are in the back keesing , deeng-aleeng makes the bell  --  and we know there is a customer . " " Bien , " I muttered aimlessly . " Et comment ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no ? " " For me , " I replied tartly , looking nervously through the glass cases , " for me , monsieur , it is raining . " " Ah , sweet meester-eeee of life , at las ' I find her . . . O000h ... " M. LaBelle began to sing happily . He stopped after a moment and asked : " For what are you looking ? " " The egg , of course , " I replied sharply . " The egg with the world inside it . The egg with the people and the angels and the cupids and the little white church . The egg you promised me gratis if you made a marriage with Mme Merryweather ! " At the sound of her name the former Mrs. Merryweather peeked out through the calico curtain which separated the shop proper from the living quarters . She waved her hand coyly.  | " I 'm so glad to see you , " she cried . " I 'm so happy ! " She made a noise like a hungry calf which can not find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said darkly . " Did you see the sign ? " she asked eagerly , ignoring my remark . " Of course I 'm not Merryweather ' any more , but then . . . " She came into the store and , bounding over to M. LaBelle , kissed him loudly on the brow with red lips that left a mark . Then she came and kissed me on the cheek . " Look , " she said , " what I brought you from Montreal ! I paid for it with the money you earned running my errands . Is n't it lovely ? " She took from behind her broad back a pillow that smelled like pine cones . There was marked on this pillow , in bright red thread : HONOUR THY FATHER AND MOTHER " You can sleep on it every night ! " Mme LaBelle exclaimed rapturously . I sighed , but said nothing . I had nothing to say . The smell of pine cones made my stomach ill , and I had honored my father and mother since the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Merci bien , madame . " Name of a pig 's small blue pig , I said to myself , I am trapped by these big people . Hot and tired , I gave one more futile glance inside the glass case . " Where is the egg ! " I shouted suddenly . " What egg ? " M. LaBelle asked , pushing back his new cap and scratching his head with a pencil . " Oh . . . Oh . . . yes , I remember . The Easter egg with the window and the pink . . . " He stuck a toothpick into his mouth and meditated.  | After a long time he looked at me sidelong and said sadly : " She is gone , the egg . " " Gone ? " I kicked my small foot against the hard counter . " Be a good boy , now , " Mme LaBelle urged . " You see , " her husband explained , " we took on the honeymoon all the bes ' can-dy . It is only natur-al . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I bit my lip hard and rubbed my eyes with my fists . M. LaBelle put his arm around my shoulder . " Someday , " he said sincerely , we weel geeve you an Easter egg beeg like your head . No ? Full wit ' an-gels , sheeps , saints , every-t'ing ! " " Leave me alone ! " I shouted and squirmed out of his arms and ran home , forgetting the pillow that honored my father and mother . I was convinced , finally , that I would never get an egg from M. LaBelle . At dinner that night I spoke sadly to my mother . " Maman , why do they not have for the big people a Sunday school ? Many of them are full of sins , also . " My father laughed . " I will tell you why , " he explained . " When they are become big their sins are so deep that there is no one strong enough to pull them up . " I sighed and shook my head . " All the time I mix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " " After a while , " Maman said kindly , " you will understand . " " After a while , " Papa said gently , " it will not matter . " Weeks later , M. LaBelle sent me an egg even larger than the one I had so Iong desired . It had sheep and saints and rabbits and flowers inside .  | It was too late . I no longer wished for an egg . The time of my life for eggs was passed . What I wished then was a suit like that of the Northwest Mounted Police , with a scarlet tunic , a cowboy hat , and blue pants with yellow stripes . That , I never got , either .  | Yvonne and the Elements The game of Sleeping Beauty that I played with Yvonne under the apple tree was one to which I always returned after any unhappiness . The Mouse gone , I came back briefly to my lovely cousin . This seeking of solace at her bosom almost got me into trouble . I was bending over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life when Alfred dashed into the yard . He had just returned from a joust with Uncle Louis ( I suspected ) and was not in a very good mood . Even one who works in a bank can , in time , be provoked to anger . " Aha ! " he shouted when he saw me . Yvonne opened her eyes and saw Alfred 's scarlet face shining under his slick hair and above his pure white , starched collar . " Comment ? a va ? " she said softly .  | " Bah ! " was Alfred 's comment . " Papa is angry again ? " Yvonne asked . " Your papa is crazy , " said Alfred . " The whole family is crazy . You , too . " He pointed at me . " Ha ! " I countered . " Uncle Louis says where everybody is crazy , nobody is crazy . " " Then I am crazy , " Alfred said . He turned to Yvonne . " He kisses you , this one . " Yvonne laughed and put her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petit cousin ? Ho ! " ( She hugged me expertly , although not at all as well as Mignonette had done . Yvonne just did not have either the years or the equipment . ) He is so young ! " " Eh ? " said Alfred . " How many years have you ? " " Maybe ten . Maybe eleven , " I said slyly . Alfred smiled . " You are big for your age , " he remarked without rancor . " I am smart , too , " I warned him . That day Alfred appealed to Aunt Felice to intercede with Uncle Louis for Yvonne 's hand . I tried to convince Aunt Felice that Alfred was no one for my beautiful princess , but Felice said : An ' usband is an ' usband . " I was consoled only by the thought that after Mignonette and Yvonne there would be someone else , just as after the canary there was The Mouse . Aunt Felice 's tactic with Uncle Louis was simple . " You will give your consent to the marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Me , " Uncle Louis repeated , thunderstruck , " go to work ? " " Yes , you . " Uncle Louis sighed and lay down on the couch .  | " Impossible , " he said . " I have lost the habit . " You will make a new habit . " " I am dying , you know , " Louis argued plaintively . " For twenty years now , you are dying , " Felice said relentlessly . Uncle Louis cocked one eye at her . " You wish to hurry me by making me break my back digging sewers ? " " Why should I wish to hurry you ? Since you have nothing to leave but the expenses of the funeral ? " Uncle Louis groaned . " She is too stingy even to bury me ! What about the insur-ance ? " " There is no insurance . Who will insure a wine keg ? " Uncle Louis turned to me . " You see what life is like ? " " I see , " I replied sympathetically . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . Eat , sleep , drink , laugh , make love , and go home alone . You under-stand ? " " Do not listen to him , " Felice said . " Get married all the times you wish . " " Later , " I agreed . " Well , " said Felice to Louis , " do you go to work or does Yvonne marry this sober , dependable ' usband . " Uncle Louis groaned . " I have no choice , " he whimpered . " I must either lose my daughter or kill myself with hard labor . Go , give my daughter to the first rascal who comes down the street . If the children are with feet like ducks the blame is on you ! Go ! " Aunt Felice set her jaw and muttered : " Hmmph ! " Then she went out . As I went by Louis I whispered words of courage : " Never  | mind , " I said , " Mlle Charbon is going to make you a present of her new canary . She told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit happy again , " there is a woman with warmth and sympathy , glass eye or no glass eye ! " Later in the evening we celebrated with cognac under the apple tree . The blossoms were all over , white in the light of the moon . Yvonne looked up the tree and spoke to Alfred . " Ah , " she said sadly , " you will never climb trees to cover me with soft apple blossoms , will you ? " " Pas de chance , " Alfred replied briskly . " I will have enough with the work at the bank . " " You will have to work hard to send the five small ones to the university , " I laughed . " He speaks , " Alfred said to Yvonne , " of the time the madman mixed me up with the ... the ... " " I know . I know , " Yvonne said impatiently . " You do not like my uncle Louis , eh ? " I said angrily . Alfred shrugged . " Maybe it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You , I suppose , have all the rooms occupied ? " I asked . Alfred smiled at Yvonne tenderly . " What do you think ? " he asked her tenderly . Yvonne smiled and touched her lips with an apple blossom . " Yes , " she agreed . " The rooms are all occupied . There is not even room for apple blossoms ! " " Bah ! " Alfred said . " That is for children , comme ceci ! " Yvonne hugged me again . " Yes , my little cabbage , but you , too , will be grown-up someday and you will not kiss Sleeping Beauties covered with apple blossoms , either . "  | " Do not imagine such a thing to yourself ! " I exclaimed noisily . " I will be grown-up , but I will still kiss Sleeping Beauties ! " Papa laughed loudly and said to my mother : " He is jealous , your bibi ! " Maman smiled gently . " It is time for bed , " she warned . " Marche couchez ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she spoke French . Her pronunciation was so bad it was amusing . " Haha ! " I mocked . " Marsh cootch hay ! Ha ! " " Your mother speaks the pure Glasgow French , " Papa said , laughing . I kissed Maman good night and went to Yvonne . Bowing from the waist , I spoke to Alfred . " You do not mind ? " I asked . " No , " Alfred said gruffly . " But after this , no more . You have only eleven and a half years ... " " He has not yet eleven , " Papa said . " Eh bien ! He has not yet eleven , " Alfred said . " But soon he will have eleven and then twelve  --  and then what ? " " What ? " I asked . But there was no reply . I kissed Yvonne and went to bed and prayed that Alfred would break out with boils and Yvonne would not like him any more , even for a husband . The wedding was held in the spring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old home of my grandfather . Gatineau Point is an unfortunate choice for a wedding in the spring , for if you go there when the thaw has set in you are caught in the floods . In fact , the residents are so used to the floods that every year they move the furniture to the second floor and wait . The day of Yvonne 's wedding , the rain came down out of the  | black sky in Ottawa , and the gutters were deep with the water rushing to Lower Town . " Unless the tide turns , " Papa said , " we shall see no wedding . " " It is bad luck to postpone a wedding , " I said . " It is worse luck to be drowned , " my father said . He went to the front window and looked down the street . I looked out , too . The lawn was like a small lake . " Pretty soon we shall have some trout here , " he observed . Maman came downstairs as Papa said this . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papa sighed , blowing her a kiss , " you look like a queen . " " Thank you , " Maman replied . " It is too bad you are not a mermaid , " my father went on . Maman looked at him closely now and observed that he was wearing his old clothes . " You had better get dressed , " she suggested . " Dressed ? Pourquoi ? " " Pourquoi ? Mon Dieu ! " " Yes . For what shall I get dressed . Tell me , I beg you . " " For the wedding , of course ! " Papa shook his head . " You mean you go to the wedding in this weather ? It rains cats and mice ! " Maman smiled at him in a hostile fashion . " What is a little water ? " Papa gasped . " Name of a cow ! A little water ! If it is like this here , how is it up the Gatineau ? Eh ? Alfred will marry in water wings . Maman stamped her small foot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting married . You forget she is very fond of you . You forget it is you who are to  | give away the bride since Louis refuses to even look at Alfred . " " To even spit ' at him , " I corrected . " Pull up your stockings , " Maman ordered . " Name of a name , " Papa shouted , mussing his hair , " who can give away a bride when he is up to his neck in water ? " " What is more , you forget we have only you for the music , " Maman added . " How will it be for Yvonne to be married with no one to play O Promise Me and The Wedding March and such ? Will such a marriage endure ? " " Ah , " said my father solemnly , " it is not the music which makes a wedding endure . . . unless it is the music in the heart , eh ? " He patted M aman ' s face gently . My mother did not succumb . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Papa said , shrugging , " I can not play a wet violin . Uncle Felix , who had roamed in at the moment , spoke to us seriously : " This sort of thing does not happen to the Catholics . " Felix was one of the few Catholics in our family . " The Catholics , " Papa laughed , " buy their weather . We Protestants are too poor . From the priests the Catholics buy their weather and their salvation . . . " " Please hurry , " Maman interrupted . She was pulling on long gloves with a thousand buttons on them . " Are you truly intending to go to Gatineau Point in this weather ? " my father asked sadly . " I am , " Maman replied . " Yvonne needs us . She is like a cat on hot bricks , you know , when anything is happening . " " She is prettier than a cat ! " I objected . " Ah , " Papa said wistfully , rumpling my hair , " she should have waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair weather , no ? "  | " You joke , " I said . " But it is not such a joke to love somebody . " Papa smiled gently . " No , " he agreed slowly , " and the more years you have the less of a joke it is . Eh , Maman ? " " Are you coming ? " my mother asked coldly . " My beloved , " Papa said firmly , " you are more beautiful than the Rideau Falls or those tall candles of the angels we call the northern lights . But you have at least one empty room in the head . " " Just the same , " Maman said quietly , " I am going . " " My hummingbird , " my father insisted , " you will never arrive . " Pouf ! " Maman exclaimed . " A brave man , you are ! Very well , I shall go by myself . " My father bowed elegantly from the waist . " You have my best wishes , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun comes out , I , too , am going ! " I announced suddenly . I realized it might be my last chance to kiss Yvonne . Papa placed his hands on his hips and looked down on me as if I had betrayed the Dominion of Canada , the French Republic , and him . " Bibi , " he announced sadly , " I did not give you any of my brains when you were born ! " Just then a knife of gold cut through the black clouds and the sunbeams danced at Papa 's feet . " So ! " my mother cried with a triumphant smile . Felix tapped his fingers impatiently . " Let us call a cat a cat . He is afraid ! " " Eh bien , " Papa agreed . He shook his head vigorously and waved his slim hands . " Let us call a cat a cat . I am that cat and I  | do not wish to get wet . I ask you to remember that I can not swim . My mother sighed and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She put them down for me and then kissed my father gently . " Au ' voir , my hero ! " she said . " Good-by , " Papa replied . " Believe me , " Felix said as a last attempt to win over Papa , " the rain is surely no more than 9.3 inches . This is only an estimate , of course . " " Of course , " Papa agreed , opening the door for us . " You did not sit all night with your finger in the water to measure it . " " Ah , " Felix sighed , " one does not measure the rain with a finger . Papa waved a hand to interrupt . He looked out over the terrain . " Who will dive the first ? " he laughed . Maman closed the door slowly in his face . He looked out at us through the glass and rolled his eyes . We three , Maman , Felix , and I , sloshed through the water to the cab garage at Rideau Street . It required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip . " It is not a Noah 's Ark I have here , " he said . " It is only a small McLaughlin-Buick . " " Since we have no animals we need no ark , " Felix explained . " Allons ! " We all climbed in , and , after much chugging and backfiring , we started . We went along fairly well , up to the hubs in water , until we got off the main highway onto a dirt road near Grandfather 's place at Gatineau . The car dragged through the mud slowly for a while . Afterward  | we went into very deep water , almost like a boat . The driver was furious . He stopped now and then and announced : " When are you ready to send out the dove , please ? " I began to wonder if perhaps Papa was not right . " Suddenly I think of something , " Uncle Felix said solemnly , his round , serious face shining . " We could have come by boat . There is the ferry , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the cab driver observed . " I need only a sail . " At that moment the final chug was heard and the car stopped . The driver threw up his hands , bringing them down hard on the steering wheel . " Voil ? ! " he exclaimed angrily . " From here you swim ! " He got out and lifted up the hood . " This , " he said , " will take hours . Maybe days . " " Come , " Maman urged Felix and me . We clambered out of the car . Uncle Felix , up to his knees in water , raised his hat to the driver . " I salute you , " Felix announced . " Send us the bill . " " Have no doubt of it , " the driver said bitterly . " Also for my time wasted while the floods recede . Name of a pig ! " We stumbled away quickly in case the driver became violent . Sloshing along in dull silence , I was , at times , up to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maman warned . " Spit it out . Diphtheria , you know . " At one point I stopped . " Papa is not such a fool , after all , " I said flatly . " Be quiet , " Maman said in exasperation . I know she yearned to tell me to pull up my . stockings or wash my face , both of which were futile now .  | When we arrived at my grandfather 's house the water was up to the sill of the front windows . We peered in . All was empty . " They have moved upstairs , of course , " Uncle Felix explained . " Always in the spring all Gatineau moves upstairs . Scientifically it should be possible to build the downstairs upstairs in the first place . C'est ? dire . . . " " Never mind , " Maman said . We all crawled in a window and climbed up the stairs . " Yvonne will be so unhappy that Papa is not here , " Maman whispered to me . " Ah , well , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is music . I can hear it . " When we reached the second floor there was a great crowd , all laughing and talking rapidly in French and English , like birds chattering and singing . In the middle of them all , to our astonishment , stood Papa . His cutaway coat was splattered with mud ; his gray spats were no longer that color . His hat was crushed and on the side of his head . His face was streaked and yet shining with laughter . Under his chin he had his violin and he was playing a merry French one-step and dancing vigorously at the same time . Uncle Felix and I looked at each other and smiled . We looked at Maman , and her face was high and proud . She looked very beautiful , my mother , when wounded : When my father espied her he came running , throwing his arms about her joyfully . " Ah , my beautiful lark , how I worried ! Name of a name ! Mmmn ! We thought you would never arrive ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think you are clever ? " " Clever ? But no ! " " How did you get here ? "  | " By the ferry , of course . When one travels through water one takes a boat . It is only natural . " " To me , " Maman announced , " it seems underhanded . " There was not much conviction in her voice . Papa turned to the others . " You see now the Scotch-Irish temperament ? To do what is common sense is underhanded to the Presbyterians . To be correct one must muddle . N'est-ce pas ? " Everyone laughed . " But why , " my mother asked , permitting a smile to lighten her pretty face , " did you not say you were coming ? " " Because I did not intend to come . But , of a sudden , I recalled that when Yvonne was very little she made me a present of a candy for my birthday and I promised her then that someday I would dance at her wedding . So I came . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially those which are made out of love . " My mother smiled at this extravagance , and when Papa kissed her before all the world she blushed and laughed as if she were the bride . " Forgive me ? " asked Papa . " Very well , " Maman , agreed . " If you will make me a gloria . This flood will make my rheumatism return if I am not careful . " My father hastened to pour a pony of cognac into a hot cup of black coffee , and soon Maman was as warm and happy as the rest . The wedding itself was of great beauty , and even I cried . All this in spite of the fact that when Alfred was asked if he took Yvonne to be his wife , he exclaimed excitedly : " Ah , oui , oui . Mais oui ! " " One oui is sufficient , " the minister reminded him . Afterward I kissed the bride many times and with such enthusiasm  | that Alfred inquired : " Are you sure , Yvonne , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , when they were all tired , Papa played a long piece on the violin . It was very gentle and sweet and everyone 's eyes were a little moist . " He is a great man , " I whispered to Maman while Papa was bowing and bowing and bowing to the great applause . " Yes , " Maman agreed , smiling . " He is a great man . And he knows it , too . " Then we both laughed . It was nice to laugh like that with my mother . It was the first time I realized that someday she might also be my friend as well as my mother .  | The Watch of Real Gold There were tears in my mother 's eyes the day she announced she had lost her watch . " It is not so much the value . . . " she began . " Eh ? Well , let us not be too hasty , " my father said . " One does not throw away gold watches . The value , too , is something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although it was but the middle of a Sunday afternoon . He had been drinking wine and thinking . One or the other had made him drowsy . " Eh ? What ? " Felix said . He rubbed his eyes . " Morning ? So soon ? I seem to have slept but a few hours . " " Return to sleep , " my father said , laughing . " Is it the watch , Maman , " I asked , " which does not keep the time ? "  | " Yes . The one which was my mother 's . It has her picture inside . It has jewels , too . " " Ah ! A watch that does not keep time ! It is not such a loss , such a watch . " " It is an old friend , " my mother said . " An old friend which does not keep time is not much of a friend . " Felix sat up suddenly . " Is it that you have lost a watch ? " " Ha ! Felix is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Let us go and look for the watch , " I suggested , ready for a treasure hunt . " Wait ! " Felix cried . " In the first place , a watch is not necessary . One knows by the smell of the kitchen across the street that it is seven in the morning . That is only an example . One knows , when the sun goes and it is between the dog and the wolf , that it is evening . No ? There are clocks in the stores and on the streets . Or one may rap on a wall and demand : What is the time , please ? ' " My mother tapped her fingers impatiently on the table . " It is not the time I care about . It is the watch . I have worn it for years . The time ... " " There is also another method , " Felix went on , unperturbed . " One measures the shadow of a pole . Then one measures one 's own shadow . As the shadow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . if I could but recall it to myself it would be very good . But there is a way , believe me . " " Bien . Suppose she loses her shadow ? " said my father . " Oho ! To lose a shadow is not possible in science . " " We will get Maman a sundial , " I offered . " I do not care about the time , " my mother almost shouted . " I  | care about the watch . It means a lot to me , and you laugh . " " I am sorry , my thrush , " my father said tenderly . " Let us examine ourselves . Where did you lose the watch ? " " Ah ! " said Felix . " There is the point . If we know where it is lost , voil ? ! it is found . No ? " " I lost it , I think , in Major Hill Park . I bought some popcorn to feed the chipmunks . . . " " So instead you feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was there , at any rate , that I discovered the watch was gone from my dress , " my mother said . " Maybe , " I said , " the chipmunks have put the watch away in the nest , like nuts . " " A chipmunk , " Uncle Felix said calmly , " could have no use for a watch . There was , however , once a dog ... " My father jumped up grandly . " Allons ! " he exclaimed as if he were leading an army . " I made once a promise that you will be mine forever , better or worse . No ? So it is my duty to find the watch of my hummingbird . Come , we go to hunt . " The four of us made our way to Major Hill Park , and while the golden sun was redding and violeting the Ch  --  teau Laurier we hunted for the watch . " It is as I said , " I muttered after our backs were near to breaking , " the chipmunks have stolen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we but had a dog , " Felix sighed . " A dog would smell first the woman and then he would smell until he had smelled the watch , no ? " " A dog , " my father said , " would chase the chipmunks . He would not be concerned with the watch . " In the end it was dark and we had not found the watch .  | " Come , my dove , " my father said to my mother , " we will return and look another time . Now we will all have a great banquet and forget our sorrow . " We all went to the Ch  --  teau and there ate a dinner to be remembered . There were salmon trout in white wine and mushrooms ; a kettledrum of stuffed quail with foie gras ; whole truffles , baked in oil paper and larded with goose grease ; and pineapple mousse and glaces cakes . In the end , too , there was , for all but me , Benedictine and brandy , which Papa and Felix had brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was so full and so content for a while . " All we needed , " Felix said with a deep sigh , " was , say , a Magnum of the Ch  --  teau La Tour 1904 Bordeaux . " My father unbuttoned his vest one button and said : " Ah , well . Nothing is ever perfect , you know . " As for me , I was so full I fell asleep for a moment and all the way home I was sleeping as I walked . When we reached home my mother was not so sad about the watch , and she went up to her bedroom as Felix and my father began a game of Spanish checkers . I fell asleep on the couch . I awakened when I heard my mother singing like the robins . She was upstairs , but she sang so loudly she could be heard plainly . She sang happily : " When you wore a tulip , a bright yellow tulip , and I wore a big red rose . " " Give me a king , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it is the first time Maman is ever drunk ? " We looked at each other , but before we could consider the matter Maman was downstairs , all smiles , all blushes . " I found it ! " she sang . " I found it ! " We all sighed with relief .  | " It was under the bed . You see , it must have fallen on the floor and then I must have kicked it under the bed . " " Ah , so , " my father said , " the chipmunks did not steal it , after all . " " I 'm so glad I lost it , " my mother said . " Comment ? " my father asked , puzzled . " I 'm so glad I lost it . Tonight , if I had not lost the watch , I would have felt ordinary . But now that I lost it and have found it again , I am as happy as a lark ! " My father sighed heavily . He arose and kissed my mother gently on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands and shook it back and forth . " Ah , ah , ah , " he muttered , grinning . " Tomorrow we must all become very ill so that when we recover we will feel so much better . "  | A Bluebird for Elsie Just when life became most lonely there came to us Elsie Wimpersall . Elsie was quite refreshing after Mignonette and Yvonne . She was British and had none of the elusive , perfumed charm of my other loves . She was utterly frank and good-natured and rather innocent . She arrived one day with a suitcase of secondhand clothes , cold creams , rouges , and perfumes she was selling . She remained for tea and cakes with my mother , who was host to the world when it passed our back door . In the end , this vendor of beauty and secondhand chic stayed with us for some time . I do not quite know how it all came about . My impression is that Elsie confessed that business was poor and threatened to cast herself into the Rideau Canal , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistaken notion , but , at any rate , Maman decided that if Papa could befriend Mignonette , Maman could befriend Elsie .  | In no time at all , Elsie and I were friends . That was about as far as our relationship ever went . She never accepted me as a suitor , an unfortunate misjudgment of hers which I put down to the fact that she was British and consequently utterly inadequate to deal with love . Frankly , I did not truly extend myself to the limit in Elsie 's case . She was not only older than I , but also very much bigger . I had , at eleven and a half , no taste for the Amazon . Papa described her once thus : " She has so much of everything , everywhere ! " She was , also , an arrant sentimentalist . There came one day into Elsie 's life a poet named Chester du Gard . This poet had written no poetry . I do not cast aspersions on him . As Papa said of Chester : " Do not laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no poetry , and singers who have sung no songs . Not to mention lovers who have never been loved . It is a state of mind to be a poet . It is to listen too closely , perhaps , to one 's own heart . " This mute poet worked in a bookstore . For a time all was well with Elsie and Chester . He would come and call on the approved nights , needing a haircut and bearing a gift for me of a small bag of hard candy to keep me out of his way . I would play the pianola for a while as they held hands and perspired and then I would withdraw with my candy , leaving them to the parlor and their dreams . If Chester 's visits ceased abruptly , surely no one could blame me . I not only assured Chester several times that there was no need for the candy since Elsie was not my type , but , as well , each night as I left the parlor after the pianola recital , I would quietly slide the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , it was not my fault . If Elsie did not know what she was doing , I did .  | We were all upset , of course , about the absence of the poet . However , we made no inquiries . In our family it was a rule that we were permitted to ask questions about every aspect of each other 's life except affairs of the heart . One night we were all at dinner , including Uncle Felix , who had come into our house because Aunt Felice had run out of Penrod . Elsie was biting nervously on her fingernail . " Tonight , " she mused in the silence , " I will give him a piece of my mind . " : " Who ? " Maman asked quietly . " Chester , " Elsie said . We all sighed simultaneously with relief . Elsie herself had brought up the subject , and we were now all automatically released from any obligation to be tactful . " Ah , Chester , " I mocked . " Pahl Pouf ! " " Take your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee , " Maman ordered . " Also do not make fun of your elders . " " Tonight , " Elsie repeated , " I will give him a piece of my mind , believe you me ! What 's more , I 'll give him back his ring . That 's what I 'll do , I will . " Uncle Felix shrugged and pointed a nut pick at her in the manner of a barrister with a pencil : " And what about the furniture , half of which , I understand , is in the attic , the other half of which is in the cellar ? And all of which only half of which , I understand , is paid for ? " Elsie drew herself up proudly in the British tradition . " He will pay for it . Every penny . Then he can take it all and give it to her ! All is over between me and Chester for all time . " Felix cocked his head to one side and almost laid it on the table . He looked up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he inquired slyly.  | This Felix , I told myself , as if I were at the cinema , has some very good source of secret information , believe me ! " The ring is paid for , " Elsie replied . " He can have that back , too : ' " If he is a gentleman , " Felix exclaimed , looking about for backing , " he will insist that you keep it ! " We all nodded in affirmation . " Perhaps , " Elsie murmured weepily , " he will want to give it to her . " " Who is her ? " I asked , unable to contain myself . It was like coming into the cinema at the middle of a picture . " Why do I not have a synopsis ? " " I will tell everybody , " Elsie said sadly . " I did not tell you before because I did n't want you to be bothered with my heartaches . I did n't want you to be worried about my troubles . " " In this house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand , " we welcome the trouble of others . " " Well ... " Elsie began nervously , " after we were friends a few weeks he told me my eyes were like blue stars and . . . " Papa spoke impatiently . " Yes , yes , we know . And your lips like the petals of red roses . The same things have been said since man first became civilized and untrustworthy . " " Well , he asked me to marry him , legally . And he gave me a ring . After that he said , Angel Face , what would you wish me to give you that you want more than anything in the world and that will make you remember this thrilling night forever ? ' " " This , " I said , " was in a cinema once with Wallace Reid . The girl said , A kiss . ' " " Do you wish to go to bed ? " Maman asked . I hastened to reply : " Oh , no ! "  | " Well , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nut pick on the china and made it ring . " Continuez , s'il vous plait , " he said to Elsie . " Let us have , please , no more interruptions . " Well , " Elsie went on , " you 'll think I 'm silly . . . but I said I wanted , more than anything , a canary that I could keep in my bedroom in a little golden cage . " " Papa had once a canary who sang Beethoven , " I said proudly . Felix pointed the nut pick at me . " Please ! " he said in a pained voice . " Let us get to the roots of this a ff aire . " " Well , " Elsie continued , " I said I wanted this canary . One that would sing in the morning when I woke up , and at night when I went to bed . He promised he would bring me one . But he never did . " She paused and sipped a little wine . " After that . . . after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He ... he " ? she glanced at Uncle Felix , who smiled sadly ? " he was seen many times strolling in and out of the bushes at Nepean Point with another girl . . . perhaps even saying to her that her eyes were like blue stars . " " Mais oui , mais oui , " Papa interrupted . " Of course he is saying the same things . What else is there to say ? " " Well , today , " Elsie proceeded , " I received a note to expect a surprise from him . I do n't know whether he means he will telephone , or come in person , or perhaps even bring a canary . If he brings a canary , after all , I wo n't be as angry as otherwise . But just the same I will give him a piece of my mind ! " Uncle Felix rapped the Limoges again and shook his head . " Among the lessons I am studying , " he observed , " is one which calls attention to the scientific fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart and soul have little or no part . Of course , in chemistry there is no heart and soul , which makes matters even worse . " Papa smiled at Maman . " For years I have been a slave to chemistry ! " Elsie was not paying attention . She looked dreamily off into space . " All my life , " she murmured , " I wanted a canary . " " Further in my studies , " Felix went on blithely , " there is psychology . Psychology teaches us that such a wish in a young woman is an indication that she wishes to have a baby . " " Not at the table , Felix , please , " Maman said gently . " It is , " persisted Felix , " nevertheless , true . " " In my day , " Papa explained , " such things were known to the general public . It did not require scientific research to discover a healthy young woman sometimes wishes a b  --  b ? . We move in new directions , eh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated , as if in a vague dream , " I have wanted a canary . Even before I knew anything about babies . " " All my life , " I offered , feeling left out , " I wanted to breed rabbits in the cellar . " " Tch , tch , " said Maman . " Raise , ' bibi , not breed . ' " " St. Bernards , " Felix noted solemnly , " would be more interesting . " " Rabbits , " I reminded my uncle , " are more quiet and more rapid . " " If we are to speak of unfulfilled dreams , let me speak of mine , " said Papa . " All my life I have wished to wear a full-dress suit to the Governor General 's ball . This suit I wished to have covered with medals , borrowed , if necessary , from Desmonde . Across the white front of my shirt , I wished a diagonal scarlet ribbon . Just once . "  | My mother sighed and lowered her eyes . When she spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she confessed softly , " I wished to have someone who loved me drink champagne from my slipper . " Papa looked at her wistfully . " Ah , " he complained , " what a pity you never told me ! " Elsie was still not of our world . She remained with her eyes fixed beyond some horizon . " Maybe , " she muttered , " if I married him , he would change . " " Oh , mais non ! " Felix countered . " I myself knew once a woman who married a drunkard . To herself she said , ' Ah , when we are married he will stop drinking . ' " " And so ? " encouraged Papa . Felix replied : " And so , when they were married , she started . " ' This is not the point , " Papa exclaimed , waving his hand . " Are ' they now happy ? " ' Why , yes , par exemple ! It is true she is now deaf and he has no more grass in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they are very happy together in the provincial poorhouse . Especially in spring when they have apple blossoms outside their bedroom . " " So , " Papa laughed , " the gold is not all in Peru , eh ? " Elsie was still immersed in thought , and we all fell silent . Her round , pink face was sad and lonely and her lips trembled a little . " Three times , mind you . At least three times , " she said , " he promised me a canary ! " Papa spoke brusquely : " Marry a man who promises you a bluebird ! " He waved his hand at Maman . " Eh ? " he said . " I did , " Maman agreed . " Oho ! " shouted Felix with a laugh , " and where is the blue-bird ? "  | " C'est moi ! " I announced , pointing my finger at myself . " Oui , " Papa chuckled , " c'est bibi ! " The discussion was interrupted by the sound of the doorbell . Uncle Felix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned with the bottle in his hand . " I was about to choke this choirboy , " he said , swinging the bottle . " But first , let us see if it is Chester . " The doorbell rang again like an angry demand . " I 'll go , " said Maman . In a few seconds she returned , followed by Chester . He stood between the portieres , grinning bashfully . " Aha , " I exclaimed . " Valentino ! " " Be quiet , " said Maman . Elsie gave Chester one small glance , as if he were a sparrow on a window sill . Then she turned up her nose . " Come , " my mother suggested nervously to Felix . " We will choke your choirboy in the parlor . " " Allons ! " Felix exclaimed happily . I spoke to Chester : " We will be listening , Valentino ! " My mother pretended to box my ears , but she was forced to smile . " He is getting awfully fresh , " she apologized . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Good , " Papa said solemnly , " good . " We all filed into the parlor and sipped the wine and pretended to discuss the chances of the Liberal party in the coming election , but we were all really listening for romance . " What fly stings you ? " Chester inquired plaintively . " Fly ? " Elsie repeated coldly . " What is the trouble ? What pains you ? " " Me ? Nothing . What makes you think something pains me ? " " You do not look like a happy rosebud , " Chester said .  | " I feel fine , " Elsie answered curtly . " I have never felt better . " " You do n't look fine , " Chester countered . " This is foolish stuff , " I whispered impatiently to Maman . " Be quiet and listen , " she said . Realizing her error , she corrected her statement to " Be quiet and do n't listen . " " I brought you something , " Chester said brightly , off on a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Something very nice . " Elsie stood up and faced Chester , who turned as red as a peony . " I am going to give you a piece of my mind . . . you . . . you ... you . . . poet ! " She turned her back and took out a fragile lace handkerchief , delicate as a morning in May . It was sad and funny , the big girl and the small handkerchief for her tears . " Chester , " she said sadly , " a girl must have some reason to be in love with a man . Especially a poet ! " " Here , " exclaimed Chester gallantly , rising to the role , " is the reason ! " He kissed her then so loudly we could hear it . " So far , " Uncle Felix whispered to Maman , " Chester is ahead . " After a while a long sigh was heard and Chester spoke . " Here is another reason , " he said . " Be still , " said Maman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I saw Chester lift the covering from a large package , and a yellow canary blinked its eyes and began to sprinkle the air with small drops of liquid sound . Elsie 's eyes grew large . She looked from the singing bird to the smiling Chester .  | Chester spoke : " I love you , " he said simply . The bird 's song grew louder . " He is off-key , that bird , " Papa whispered to me . " What is the difference ? " I inquired . " The man in the store , " Chester ' explained , " said no one in love should be without a canary . Me , I wanted for you lovebirds . The man said , but no ! lovebirds are forever at each other 's throats . Canaries are so busy singing and making the world about them harming that they have no time for temperament . Their love is simple , elemental , radiant , and creative . " Papa motioned to Maman . " We may all learn something from this fellow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you kiss her at Nepean Point ? " " Ah , " Papa muttered , " women wish the larks , already roasted , to fall into their mouths . " For a long time Chester stood in silence . " Come away from there , " Maman called to me . I whispered : " I only wish to close the portieres so no one will see them . After all . . . " I waited in suspense for Chester to speak . Uncle Felix was talking softly behind me . " If he lies , he is lost , believe me ! " Presently Chester took a large breath and spoke . " Yes , " he admitted flatly , " I did . " " You did ? " Elsie repeated , flustered by his frankness . " But only , " he pleaded , putting his arms around Elsie , " out of politeness . " Suddenly Elsie laughed in the good-natured way of other days and threw her arms around Chester and hugged him so hard I felt the pains in my ribs . Much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elsie within a month , and pay for the furniture , and stay away  | from Nepean Point , we choked some choirboys in honor of the event . We were all as merry as squirrels , even I , who was allowed but two small glasses . " Recall to yourself , " laughed Felix , throwing his arm around Elsie as far as it would go , " recall to yourself , you were going to give him a piece of your mind ! " " Oho ! " laughed Papa . " A piece of your mind ! " " Instead , " I interrupted , brilliant in my cups , " she gave him a piece of her heart . Eh ? " Elsie smiled and threw her arms around me and kissed me , which was , I suppose , what I was after . " In this house , " she said sweetly , " is a young philosopher . " " Nevertheless , " Papa insisted , " I would have felt still better if he had given you a bluebird. "  | The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once more the burdens of housework fell on Maman and once more she was stricken with inflammatory rheumatism , as it was then called . For a time it was necessary for her to go to bed , and I remember well the sounds of pain and the smell of hot liniment which was forever being rubbed on her arms and back . I insisted I stay home from school for a while and be a nurse to Maman . When I was sick , I observed , or had a black eye from baseball , or a twisted ankle from skating , Maman had always been ready with kisses and medicine and bandages . Now that she was ill , I felt it was my turn to care for her . So I said good-by for a while to my adventures and my romances and sat mostly in the parlor , reading once more the books of fairy tales and the volumes of adventure . Now and then , I ran to the kitchen and prepared hot soup . Often , I fixed the pillows behind her weary head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always featuring myself as the modest hero . I was sad , of course , at Maman 's rheumatism , but I was happy I had grown up enough to be of help . I told myself in bed , with  | fierce clenchings of my fists , that there was nothing in the world I would not dare to ease her agony and make her well again , that she might laugh and tell me to pull up my stockings or take my elbows from the table . Alas , one day I learned that when we love we often estimate too highly the strength for fine deeds this love will bring us . Our hearts are stronger , sometimes , than our spirits . Papa , this day , was at work . The uncles had gone up the Gatineau with Aunt Felice to see Yvonne and her husband . Uncle Louis , of course , would not budge from his bed and wine for anything short of an earthquake . There was no one about . " Bibi ! " my mother called in a weak voice that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I put down the Red Fairy-Tale Book I was reading and ran swiftly into her bedroom . " Will you do something for me ? " She seemed pale and weak . " Mais oui , Maman , anything ! " " It is something hard for a little boy to do . Perhaps you will be shy . " " Pas moi ! I am not any more a little boy . Besides , I wish you to be well again and to laugh and sing and make pies . " My mother smiled and drew me to her , muttering as the exertion pained her arms . " All my nightgowns are stained with balm . Maybe I am foolish , but I think I would feel much better if I had a nice new clean nightgown . " I began to blush already . " Will you go , " she continued , " to Poulin 's and buy me a new one ? Pick out one you like . I will leave it to you . You can put it on Papa 's bill . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried . For a while I sat silently , biting on my knuckles .  | " Maman , " I said at length , " I would be very , very nervous to go into a woman 's store and buy a nightgown . I would blush and be a fool . I would be afraid , too , that someone from the school would see me and there would be jokes forever . I would have to go , perhaps , to a new school to begin again . Maman . . . I will do anything . . . but , please . . . not to buy a nightgown in the big ladies ' store . " II My mother sighed and leaned back , shutting her eyes . " All right , " she said . " Never mind , bibi . " I went slowly back to the parlor and my book of fairy tales . I tried to read , but it was impossible . I was very unhappy and ashamed . As always , in this case , I tiptoed up the stairs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blue and then through the pink . " It is like this , you understand , " I told myself . " If you are a coward it is a world through the blue glass . If you are brave it is a world through the pink glass . The world is just the same . It is all in which glass you use . " It worked , my minor mysticism . " Maman is sick , " I spoke again to myself , and you who are always telling her how brave you are , you are as weak as soup . " I took a deep breath and crossed my fingers  --  all of them on one hand . I had to force the small one over , but I managed . Then I got my cap , tucked in the string of my blouse , pulled up my stockings , and went into my mother 's room . " I am going to play ball , " I told her . " I will be back soon . " Half asleep , she murmured : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to M. Poulin 's great store . I was hot and nervous and kept pulling my cap down , trying to hide part of my face . I walked past the store entrance once and peeked in at the  | mysterious pink and white articles that hung on racks or stood on iron crosses on the counters . It was almost impossible for me to make my legs walk in . " Dear Lord , " I muttered , after walking around the block several times , " it is some time since I have bothered You . Please consider this and make everything all right . Make me get the nightgown and make no one see me and laugh . " Looking up and down the street like a crook in a cinema serial , I observed no one I knew and walked into the store , my knees knocking . I hardly came up to the counter , where a pretty girl was folding things and putting them away . Ordinarily , to deal with a pretty girl made me feel warm and comfortable . But not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shirts and stockings , and many other strange objects I had never seen before . It was as if I were in a strange lady 's bedroom and I wanted to get out because it was not nice to be there . " Can I do something for you ? " the girl asked . I gulped . I tried to speak , but no words came . There were only whispers , as when one has a hoarse throat . " I wish , " I said huskily , " . . . my mother , who is sick , wishes ... " I took hold of the counter with my small hands and put my head high above it . I thought hard of dear Maman and it gave me strength . " I wish a nightgown , " I explained rapidly . " For my mother . To wear in bed . She has the inflammatory rheumatism . A pretty nightgown . " " A nightgown . Yes ! " The girl said it so loudly I was worried . I looked around again to see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gown from a large box and held it out , full length , against herself . " Do you like this ? " To myself , I thought : Name of a name , does she have to wave it around like a flag ? I blushed and glanced down the aisle . Sacre ! A Mrs. Framingham whom I knew was approaching with her little boy . I saw them first and went quickly behind the counter , crouching down beside the astonished clerk . The Framinghams passed by without noticing me , and I came out of hiding , blushing . " What 's the matter ? " the girl asked , laughing . " Nothing , " I replied hastily . " Ne rien . " She held out the nightgown again . " Do you like this one , then ? " " Yes . No . I do n't know , " I said . The girl shrugged and brought out another box . From it she took a beautiful blue gown with blue ribbons and lace . " What size is. your mother ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Name of a blue cow ! I did not ask the size . . . she is not big . . . she is not small . . . she is . . . in the middle . " " About my size ? " the girl inquired , standing up straight and posing for me . I regarded the girl carefully . I almost forgot my shyness now that I was busy estimating and appreciating . " Yes . Yes . . . but in the front . . . the . . . she . . . she is not so far ahead . Comprenez-vous ? And in the back . . . there , she is not so far behind . " The girl laughed as if I had made a wonderful joke . " Is she pretty , your mother ? What kind of a gown would she  | wish ? Something simple ? Or something wonderful , with lace and ell ? " " Ah , " I replied solemnly , " Maman is very beautiful . Mais oui ! Papa says she is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl smiled . " Then I have just the thing ! " She took a black nightgown from a box , one with bows and lace and so thin that when she held it before her I could see her face through the black material . " Ah , oui ! " I said joyfully . " There we have it ! " " You like that ? " " Oh , yes . That is wonderful ! " " Will you pay cash ? " " No , " I said , feeling very grown-up now , " you will charge it , please , to my bill . " I gave her Papa 's name , and she wrapped the gown . When she was finished , she patted my head and smiled . " So your mamma is a queen , huh ? " " Mais oui , " I agreed . " Papa says every woman should be treated as a queen . But Maman is a queen ! " " I 'm sure she 'll like this gown , " the girl said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon . " " Merci Bien , " I replied . I picked up the large box and trudged slowly home with it . I was hot and tired , but I felt triumphant , too . I had done something I thought I was afraid to do , and I had done it for Maman . When I arrived home and my mother opened the box she was astonished and delighted . " What a surprise , bibi ! " she exclaimed . She slowly drew out the sensational black nightgown , and her eyes became as big as black cherries with wonder .  | " What a wonderful thing ! " she said . " And you picked it out all by yourself ! " " Oui , " I said modestly . " How did you happen to choose this one ? " I hesitated a moment and grinned a little foolishly . " Well , " I explained , " it is because you are a queen and this is the nightgown for a queen . In the books of fairy tales the nightgown of the queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and very long at the bottom , and it is always full of lace ! " My mother hugged me to her for a long time , and I felt a small tear come down her cheek . " Does it hurt , the rheumatism ? " I asked . " No , bibi . Nothing hurts just now . The tear is for happiness . The next day she was much better , sitting up in bed in the queen 's nightgown , while Papa made jokes . " I myself , " be laughed , " am having made by the custom tailor a suit of ermine . Double-breasted . I am expecting to buy soon , too , a carriage with four white horses . " Maman put her arm around me . " We will have quite a palace here , eh ? " she said .  | Grandfather and the Widow-Trap Grandpa might plague Louis and Desmonde as if they were small boys , urging them to stop drinking , to forget women , to consider the serious aspects of life . But he himself was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a man of Grandpa 's one hundred and five pounds should be careful of his adventures , Grandpa observed : " It is all muscle , you understand . " That Grandpa himself was not so confident in that muscle became apparent when he began to court the Widow LaChance . He appeared , one evening , in the dining room , as dapper and bright as a bowl of Maman 's pansies . His skin was pink from rubbing and sparkled like the imitation diamond attached to his cravat . He wore a white linen jacket , with only one slight stain from a brandy chocolate on it . He wore immaculate pale blue  | trousers . And he wore a sailor straw with a blue-and-white band . The hat was tilted at an angle that seemed to ignore gravity . He carried a yellow cane , which he twirled like the drum-major of the Governor General 's Foot Guards . He announced to the awed assembly in the room that he was en route " faire l'amour " ! In French , of course , to make love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpretations . We all laughed at this boast . " It will unscrew your billiard table , " Desmonde roared . " It will be your death , all right , " Felix noted . " Under such conditions the arteries . . . or is it the veins . . . " " It will stop your teeth from aching , " Papa interrupted . Grandpa 's eyes twinkled and ' he executed a little dance step . " The one who knows of a better way to die , will he step forward ? " " You will knock your legs together and crack them with that dancing , " Desmonde laughed . " I am two of you in every sense , " Grandpa snorted . On , then , to the beautiful Widow LaChance . " " The guillotine , " Felix observed , " awaits . " Later , by discreet inquiries and some listening to confidential whispers , I learned something about Grandpa 's affairs with the Widow . He had a rival , it appeared , one Gunboat Hodge , a man who drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the largest chest expansion in Ontario . Bending a crowbar was a pleasure to Gunboat , and frequently , at Sunday-school picnics , I had seen him lie on his back and permit large boulders to be broken on his stomach with a sledge hammer .  | Grandpa , at his age and weight , was no match for this monster . My grandfather , apparently , did not know of his rival when he first began to court the Widow . My grandfather was , above all , wise . He was not a man to encourage violence , especially to his own delicate person . He was , in short , not the type for any sort of duel . I asked Maman one day how Grandpa had met the Widow . " It was at a church minstrel , " she said soberly . " Grandpa sang On the Road to Mandalay and Mme LaChance was slightly moved . But when he danced the buck-and-wing , his sprightliness captivated her , even though he was in burnt cork . " " Ah , then , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this buck-and-wing ? " " Yes , " Papa joined in , " it will be a comfort to you in your old age . " " But why , " I asked , sincerely puzzled , " does Grandpa wish to love the Widow LaChance when , already , he loves . . . " ( here , I began to count on my fingers ) " Mme Frechete , the modiste ; Mlle Cocteau , the teacher of the ballet ; Mme Pernod , the chanteuse ; Mlle , McPhail ... " Enough . Hold ! " cried Papa . " You will be all day at that ! " " Is this , after all , something to discuss with a young boy ? " Maman asked , a little upset . " So , " said Papa , " if he does not discuss it with us , he will discuss it with others less intelligent and with minds perhaps more evil . " My mother smiled gently . " Yes , perhaps . But in my day we did not discuss the love affairs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , " Papa said . " But why ? " I persisted . " Why does Grandpa ... ? "  | " With some people , " my father explained , " it is butterflies . With your Uncle Desmonde it is ornate garters ; with Felix it is useless information ; with Grandpa it is beautiful women over fifty . " " Ah , oui , " I commented . This began to make sense . " Over fifty , mind you , " my father continued . He was now talking really to tease Maman , but he spoke to me . " Grandfather is not the one to go chasing after young girls . He knows his place in the scheme of amorous things . Nor is he the type of which one reads in the American Sunday papers , the ones in whose trunk are found , by the police , middle-aged torsos , previously insured for enormous sums . " " That , " said Maman , " will be enough , dear " After this discussion I sought an appointment with Grandpa in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of many things as he sipped his violet wine and rocked in his chair . At last we came to the point . " It is like this , " Grandpa explained . " I love the women in full bloom . Big ? " " Not big , " Grandpa corrected . " Complete . " " Ah . " " It is as if one held up a rose to the light of the sun ! " Grandpa raised his wine to the electric light . " Nothing more , you understand . " " Nothing more , " I agreed , not knowing precisely what more there was . " At fifty , " Grandpa went on , warming to the subject , " a woman is perfect . " To me , it seemed a long time to wait , but I offered no comment , being satisfied at the revelations . " At forty-five she is not yet fully developed . I am speaking  | now , of course , of the heart , the spirit , the mind . After fifty .. . let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oui , " I agreed . I saw in my mind long rows of women of fifty-five , their heads drooping like sunflowers . " Now , " Grandpa continued , " we have in Ottawa many women of fifty , at their choicest year . And we have so few men to give them appreciation . And why ? " " Why ? " " Because men old enough to appreciate them are already married and so have lost their sense of the appreciation of beauty . Or if by chance they are still single , they have ulcers of the stomach . There has never been a romantic man with ulcers of the stomach . It is impossible . I speak not with cynicism . I speak with compassion . My stomach is as cast iron . " Thus spake Grandpa . Well , it was only after he had been at tea with the Widow LaChance several times , admiring her Limoges and her Courbet , that he realized he had pointed his cane into a nest of hornets . Gunboat , having taken a day off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cellars , called on the Widow as a surprise . He appeared , according to Grandpa : " . . . in a tight-fitting seersucker suit which caused him to look like a large ox tongue which had been wrapped hastily in wrinkled brown paper by the butcher 's small son . An oversize ox tongue wearing twelve D shoes . He had around his red neck a bow tie attached with a band of elastic . His face was bright and rough from scrubbing , like a kitchen floor . In his hands , which were like bunches of long , wilted carrots , he carried a group of pussywillows and a box of chocolates . " When he saw me he placed the gifts on the table and shouted like a bull : Who is this ? '  | " The dear lady replied : This is a charming raconteur who amuses me enormously . ' " A what ? ' bellowed the bull . " Pray be seated , ' Mme LaChance requested graciously . " For the next two hours " ( Grandpa is still speaking ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in French , which M. Gunboat does not comprehend except when it is profane . I spoke about the painting of Monet , the music of Debussy , the arrangement of the French Chamber of Deputies , and so forth . I imagined this would cause M. Gunboat to fall asleep . It did not , alas . He is possessed of an amazing resistance . In fact , listening to my own buzz , it was I who began to doze . " Not so long after , we learned that Gunboat had become very jealous and had sworn on a barrel of Black Horse Ale to remove Grandpa from competition , if not from the very face of the earth . When I mentioned the matter to Grandpa , his hundred-odd pounds quivered slightly , but his face remained calm . " Men have died , " he quoted mysteriously , " and the worms have eaten them . But not for love . " Gunboat , however , apparently realized that he would have no thanks from Mme LaChance if he broke Grandpa 's brittle bones . Gunboat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our house one day a belle whom Grandpa had once courted briefly . This belle claimed loudly that Grandpa had promised , in legible writing , to marry her . Grandpa , whose memory was poor and whose imagination , when penning billets-doux , was excellent , did not deny the charges . Instead , he served Mlle Finklewort a fine champagne , showed her his collection of military buttons and his ribbon of the French Legion of Honor . He inquired if Mlle Finklewort had ever considered displaying her radiant beauty to a larger public than her circle of  | friends , by appearing on the stage . He kept referring to her , casually , as " Comtesse , " as if he were confusing her with some highborn lovely . In the end , the object of her visit completely forgotten , Mlle Finklewort bade Grandpa au ' voir as he kissed her hand , his back creaking audibly . Gunboat did not relent . In a few weeks Grandpa found himself gaily defending his reputation in the District Court . A gaudy young thing , on whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the plaintiff . Grandfather enjoyed himself thoroughly , proving to the judge that the charming young lady in question was the mother of two children of doubtful origin and that she had been twice arrested and convicted : once for stealing chickens from a neighbor and once for lifting pies from an unattended baker 's rig . In the end , Grandpa emerged victorious , his photograph appearing eventually in the Ottawa Citizen and Le Droit . Gunboat , in his frustration , now became psychologically morbid . In what was intended to be a war of nerves , he began mailing Grandfather weird and frightening objects . The gifts included a dead mouse , a live owl ( Gunboat 's mother , bewitched , Grandpa said ) , the shrunken skull of a cannibal , and a number of other choice relics . Grandpa was merely amused . He had owned a life-size skeleton for years . Presently he began to receive telephone calls from a gypsy with a wavering , gloomy voice and a cockney accent who predicted dire happenings to Grandpa if he did not leave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this rather entertaining . But he was , after all , a man of taste and refinement . He was not used to long-drawn-out adventures . ( His true delight was in the  | crisp , the incisive , the subtle , and the spontaneous . " To tell the truth , " he explained to us one night at supper , " I am become bored with this rhinoceros . Were Mme LaChance not so lovely I might give her up for some less difficult beauty . Unfortunately , I am terribly attached fo the Widow . Also , I have not met any other beauty lately . There seems , then , nothing to do but eliminate M. Gunboat ! " " A duel , eh ? " Papa said . " Champagne corks at ten paces , " Desmonde suggested . " A champagne cork , " Felix said , " will not travel ten paces with any effect . " " I have my own methods , " Grandpa said darkly . " I do hope you 'll be careful and not hurt anybody , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cackled Grandpa . Now , Gunboat was a man of strict habits , Grandpa had discovered . He knew Gunboat always came to Mme LaChance 's by the same route through a dark woods in Ottawa East , and at the same hour . Grandpa , thereupon , planned to trap Gunboat  --  literally . He took me into conference , without appointment , one day , making me draw a cross with the blood pricked from my thumb and swear not to tell a soul the things which were to be revealed . I swore and became an accomplice . Together we journeyed to Ottawa East shortly afterward and constructed a beartrap . It was , of course , really a mantrap . We dug a pit , as I had learned from books on hunting big game  --  a very , very deep pit . A pit which , my book of jungle lore and adventure told us , permitted no escape . Its final triumph was a firm mesh of heavy wire , followed by  | enormous iron bars , both of which we had carried to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bars and the wire came down after the trap had closed and made escape impossible without aid . Fortunately , Grandfather had sense enough to place food and water in the pit . He intended , he explained , to leave Gunboat in the trap for a few days until he was sufficiently frightened never to bother Grandfather or the Widow again . Then the rival was to be released . We waited in the darkness beside the trap . " Does this hurt your conscience ? " Grandpa whispered . " Not if it works , " I replied solemnly . It was pitch-dark when we thought we observed Gunboat . Unfortunately , as it proved later , we were so eager to spring the trap and watch our masterpiece work that we did not have our wits sharpened to their keenest points . But spring the trap , we did . Then we drove the truck hastily back to Ottawa to establish an alibi . It was three days later that Grandfather , rather jumpy , tele-phoned the police in a high falsetto voice , squeaking that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the Rideau in Ottawa East . Grandfather , of course , had been too nervous to go near the Widow during Gunboat 's absence . It was just as well . He would not have found the Widow home . She was down in the pit with Gunboat . A month later it was announced that the Widow LaChance and Gunboat were to be married . When we told the news to Grandfather he was philosophic . He twirled the waxed ends of  | his mustache and said : " After all , when a man and woman spend four days together in a cave  --  four days and four nights  --  without a chaperon , there is nothing much they can do but get married . " He reached for one of his brandy chocolates and bit into it hard . " You know , of course , " he observed casually , " that she wore a wig ? "  | The Beautiful Blue Angel of Uncle Louis Uncle Louis was dying again . Uncle Louis was , of course , always dying . But this time Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double house . " Viens ici ! Louis dies ! " The walls resounded . The plates on the mantel shook . The pictures swayed . Louis was dying ! " This time , " said Papa , upset at having his late breakfast marred , " let us hope he succeeds ! " We rushed into Uncle Louis ' front room and there he was , as usual , stretched out on the bed , the water cooler of white wine beside him . " I saw an angel , " Uncle Louis said plaintively , his red nose quivering . " A beautiful angel ! " Papa shut one eye and looked at the water cooler with the other .  | He shrugged . ' With some people it is snakes . With Louis it is angels . Lucky Louis . Louis the Lucky , eh ? " " He looks badly , " Maman said solemnly , in almost a whisper . " Speak up ! " commanded Louis . " He always looks badly , " said Aunt Felice . " Sunshine has not touched him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " tell me about the angel . " Since I had heard a great deal about angels in church but had never actually seen one , I was vitally interested . " Aha ! " Uncle Louis exclaimed happily , " go to a child for understanding . I will tell you about the angel , bibi . First , the angel was female ... " " But naturally , " my father interrupted . " Angels are also men , " I protested . " With long curls , perhaps . But men . " " Eh bien , " my father agreed . " But not with Louis . " " The angel , " Louis went on with a grimace at Papa , " was female and beautiful . The angel wore a gown of pale blue like the sky . Only , this garment was of little use , for one could see , dimly yet definitely , everything ! " " An angel ... has ... everything ' ? " I was slightly confused . " Excuse me , " Maman said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want it to burn . " She went out , and Louis watched her sadly . " Imagine it ! For an apple pie she leaves ! How many times a year does this family have angels ? Is it an everyday thing I bring you , this miracle ? " " There was also a miracle ? " I sat on my uncle 's bed , almost unable to contain myself . " Remove yourself from the bed , " Papa ordered . " You will catch this plague for yourself . " Uncle Louis glared at Papa and then turned to me once more .  | " There was also a miracle . Yes . If there was an angel , you may be sure I insisted on a miracle . Especially when the angel was so lovely ! This angel , tall , blonde , with blue eyes and wings of the same color . Her eyes were darker than the gown , and very luminous . This angel , in truth , had in her eye a star of great brilliance ! With her was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He who had been blessed turned the spigot of the water cooler and refreshed-himself with white wine . Licking his lips happily , he continued : " This angel smiled and said : Confess your sins and come with me to Paradise , where I will love you forever ! ' " " Personally ? " inquired Papa . " But of course , personally . If I am to judge by the warmth of her tone and the star shining in her eye . " " Uh-huh , " muttered my father . " Are you ready ? ' " Louis quoted , " she asked me . Are you ready to die ? ' " " What did you say ? " I asked . " I said : No . ' Then she stroked slowly , with a hand of white velvet , my feverish head . She kissed me with lips that were the petals of a scarlet , sweet-smelling rose . . . the bird sang ... " " How much wine , " Papa interrupted calmly , " was in the cooler at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooler was full . Believe me , I was as sober as the Reverend McKintosh in the pulpit . The angel caressed me for many minutes . Then again she asked : Are you ready ? ' By this time I was , of course , nearly ready . " " And then ? " I asked anxiously . Papa coughed uneasily . " What did you reply this time ? " he asked . Uncle Louis glowed and shrugged .  | ' What could I say ? Sacrebleu ! Were you yourself ever made love to by an angel in a blue gown , through which , very distinctly . . . " " No , no , no , " Papa insisted rapidly , waving his hands about in confusion . I did not know whether he was skeptical or envious . If Uncle Louis had not been visited by a real angel , at least he was having all the pleasure of an a f f aire with the genuine article . " Ah , " Uncle , Louis sighed , his bleary eyes twinkling , " you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am dying and you mock me . This angel had with her not only a bird but also a bunch of sweet , fresh spring violets , still wet with the dew . Ha ! How is that , mon vieux ? You believe me now ? " " Name of a large blue pig ! " my father roared . ' Where arc there violets wet with dew in the middle of the winter with the snow three feet deep and the sidewalks packed hard like a skating rink with ice ? You are a fool , Louis . " Uncle Louis spoke casually , with a pert nod of his head : " From Paradise , of course , she brought the violets . " " In the Experimental Farm there is a hothouse , " I said hesitantly , not wishing to play the role of disillusioner . " We went once from school . There , they might grow violets . " Uncle Louis tore at his hair . Papa turned to him and said : " Aha ! So an angel is to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so he may be encouraged to die . Maybe it was Mlle Charbon in her old blue kimono , eh ? Perhaps the violets were made of cloth and from her hat ? Perhaps the star was her glass eye shining ? No ? " " What about the bird ? " I asked . My question was ignored . " So ! I am drunk , " Uncle Louis sneered . " Is that what you tell me ? I am so drunk I do not know Mlle Charbon , a hag with a  | mustache and a glass eye ? I do not know Mlle Charbon from an angel ? " " C'est correct ! " Papa said . Uncle Louis banged on his forehead with the heel of one hand . " If this is so , I am anxious to die ! Believe me , my dear brother , in that case I shall depart immediately . Get the priest ! Get the rabbi ! Get the Presbyterian minister . Get them all ! I die ! I die ! Angel in blue , I am coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooler and shouted and raved for so long that we became upset enough to summon , as a last resort , Father Sebastian , the Reverend McKintosh , and Rabbi Fine . They came in a great hurry , one after the other . Uncle Louis was known to everyone in Ottawa , and curiosity alone was enough to bring these three noble agents of the Lord a-running . " You wish to confess , Louis ? " Father Sebastian inquired after Louis had ordained that nothing should commence until all three had arrived , giving each one a fair whack at my uncle 's immortal soul . Uncle Louis sighed and said simply : " I have nothing to confess . I rack my brains and there is nothing . At first I thought there was something , but no . " " Calumny , perhaps ? " the Father suggested with a twinkle . " I do not even know the meaning of the word , " Louis protested sadly . " You have looked upon the wine when it was red ! " Reverend McKintosh noted . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deathbed . " White . . . red . . . there is no difference . " " A little wine , ' " Louis quoted , " for thy stomach 's sake .  | McKintosh shrugged helplessly . " Shall I pray ? " he asked . " I can pray , " Louis replied . " I do not have to hire someone to pray for me ! " " Look , " Rabbi Fine said briskly . " There are as many ways to Paradise as there are souls . Perhaps , in the end , you do not need us . " Ah , " corrected Father Sebastian , " it depends on which Para-dise you wish to arrive at . " The monastery had had an effect . " In my Father 's house , ' " Reverend McKintosh agreed , " are many mansions . " If it were not so , I would have told you , ' " I added from mem-orized Bible verses . Reverend McKintosh smiled dryly and patted my head a little more roughly than necessary . " Very good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Paradise is Paradise , " Rabbi Fine insisted . " There are degrees , " Father Sebastian countered mildly . By this time Papa had provided wine for the contestants and they all sat down , even McKintosh , and unthinkingly sipped dry , golden sherry . Uncle Louis , worn out by the discussion , was soon snoring . The three servants of the Lord concluded their talk and fin ished up the wine without reaching any conclusion as to how many heavens there were and how to get there . The divines were about to tiptoe out when Louis awoke with a start and refreshed himself at the fount of white wine . " Wait ! " he exclaimed . " Since none of you has any advice , per-haps you would like to hear of a wonder ! " " Be calm , " Father Sebastian said jovially . " Since you have no sins you have nothing to worry about . " " Uncle Louis will perhaps be a saint ! " I exclaimed in rapture . " Perhaps , " Reverend McKintosh agreed , patting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis of the Water Cooler , " Father Sebastian chuckled , his eyes bright and his pink cheeks aglow . " Laugh ! Laugh ! " shouted my feverish uncle . " I have witnessed today a miracle . I , perhaps , have made it . Who knows ? " " There , there , " said the rabbi soothingly . " A miracle ! " Louis repeated so loudly that Papa came in from next door . " Something is wrong ? " my father inquired anxiously . " Nothing is wrong , " explained Father Sebastian , winking . " Saint Louis has made a miracle ! " " Yes , a miracle , " Louis persisted . " An angel in a blue gown so thin everything was distinct . She came from the garden , bringing a bird from heaven ... " " Where is this bird ? " McKintosh inquired . Louis arose and went to the cupboard . He removed a covered object . Unveiled , it was a birdcage and in it a canary which imped and now began to sing happily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed Rabbi Fine . " It limps , " observed McKintosh . " Would a bird from heaven imp ? " " The lame ones are the best singers , " I asserted . " True , " agreed my father , " as in life , those who are hurt make he best poets . " Uncle Louis refreshed himself once more and then fell back an the couch . " This angel who came with the bird had eyes which shone like a star . She kissed me and offered to lead me away with her . She told me to confess my sins and join her in Paradise . " " Paradise ? " queried Reverend McKintosh tartly . " Or Mont-real ? " Father Sebastian now tapped his lips gently and spoke softly : " You know this bird resembles the canary of Mlle Charbon , the schoolteacher . The description , too , might be of this lady who  | has , you know , an eye of blue glass . . . " Uncle Louis groaned and fell back . " Good day , gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I forgive you . You are jealous of my miracle . All your lives you have tried to make a miracle , and lacking faith you have failed . I , without even trying , have made a miracle . Besides , I do not have your education . You are envious . You are covetous . You make the sins you forgive in others . Good day . I will die and go to Paradise my own way ! " The three clerics looked at each other and smiled with superiority . " We shall pray for you , " McKintosh promised as they started to file out . " Do not trouble yourself , " Louis retorted . " I will do my own praying and I will work my own miracles . " He reached under the bed and drew forth a bunch of the largest violets I have ever seen . Everyone smelled them and felt them nervously . They were as fresh and fragrant as if they had been picked but recently in a magic wood . " Look ! Look for yourselves , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sebastian , and Fine were ready to pop from their respective heads . " The snow is three feet deep ! " Louis screamed . " All is frozen ! The ice is thick on the river ! The trees are made of black ice . Nothing grows ! But I , I have fresh violets from Paradise ! Go , you heretics ! Go ! Leave me alone with my faith ! " Uncle Louis waved his hand toward the door and then reached again for a glass of wine . The startled three went quietly out , their mouths hanging open . Papa followed them , looking back once at Uncle Louis as if to make sure he was not acquiring a halo or wings . Alone with my uncle , I climbed on his bed . " Do not die , " I begged . " Do not die right now , Uncle Louis . "  | Uncle Louis regarded me with half-open eyes . He considered my plea for some time . " Oh , well , " he said at length , " since you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you from the clutches of the materialists , I will remain alive briefly . But , believe me , my strength ebbs and I long for the arms of my angel of the violets . " I laughed . " Oho ! Your angel is Mlle Charbon . Surely it is the limping canary she promised you ? No ? And I recall now that she teaches the grade above me  --  the eights  --  and she has taken them for nature study to the Experimental Farm often . She picked there in the hothouse the wonderful violets ... " Uncle Louis raised himself aloft and regarded me with a look of sheer agony . It was as if I had stuck a knife in his heart . " You ? You doubt my miracle . . . my angel ? You , of all people ? " " No ... " " There is nothing now to live for . I die . " " No , no , " I cried . " No , Uncle Louis . Please do not die . " " Do you believe ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Deeply moved , I replied : " I believe . I believe because you believe . " " Eh bien , " Louis said . " Then I do not die . You are a smart boy . Someday , if you keep your faith , you , too , will have an angel in a blue gown so thin . . . yes . . . someday you , too , will go with her to Paradise . " He shut his eyes and smiled . " You are sure you have faith ? " he asked in a moment . " Yes , " I said . " I have faith . " Louis sighed heavily . " Good . I only wish I could say the same for my wife . " Then my uncle quietly passed out .  | The Twilight of a Faun If I learned something of blind faith from my uncle Louis , something of magic and romance from Yvonne , and something of treachery , alas , from Mrs. Merryweather and M. LaBelle , it was from M. Dubois , Faun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted once a week to attend the Saturday matin  --  e performance at the vaudeville theater where Papa played . Equipped with two packages of Necco wafers ( thin , multicolored , many-flavored sugar disks ) , I would arrive at the theater with my father about a half-hour before the performance began . I would go with him downstairs , under the stage where the dressing rooms were . Here , while Papa sorted music and played rummy with the other musicians , I would sit , usually , on a large , heavily labeled trunk and absorb the world of the theater.  | Performers who were getting dressed or just hanging around would often talk to me . Sometimes they even showed me tricks of magic , feats of juggling , or dance routines . I had been going to the theater every week for several years , and some of the performers I knew well from previous engagements , as they went around the circuit , often , in six months and sometimes less . One of them was a dancer named LaSalle Dubois . M. Dubois danced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Nymph . " It was a very serious and classical dance , and I did not like it because I did not understand it and the music for it was not to my taste . Nor , indeed , did I understand M. Dubois , who was the saddest-looking man I had ever known . My uncle Louis , dying , never looked as sad as M. Dubois in the best of health . Every time he had been in Ottawa he had sat quietly in his dressing room , his long , hairy head cupped in his hands , his eyes , large and wistful , gazing vaguely into space , brooding . He spoke very little . On this day then , of the twilight of a faun , M. Dubois was with us again and sadder than ever . My father was rearranging some cues on top of sheets of music , perhaps for an act which had changed part of its routine . " Papa , " I asked , " why is it M. Dubois is always so sad ? " " He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sad . " " But why ? " To me actors were never really sad , except on the stage . In the dressing rooms and backstage they were forever gay and good-natured and nearly always full of wine . " Sais pas , " Papa replied . " Maybe before he is born his Maman plays all the time Chopin . There are many reasons for being sad in this world . One 's stomach , perhaps , revolts . One marries the  | wrong woman . One marries the right woman . One 's heart beats too fast . Many reasons . " I knew that my father must be busy and not thinking very clearly , for his explanation did not satisfy me at all . " No , " I protested , " these are not the reasons for the sadness of M. Dubois . " " Eh bien ! " Papa observed , looking at me and smiling gently . " You go then , young philosopher , and discover for yourself why fauns are sad . " I took him literally . I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting on a costume of hair to become a faun . He was , also , drinking cognac from a bottle . He said nothing when I ambled into the room and sat down on a trunk marked with red-and-white letters on paper : THE FAUN AND THE NYMPH B. F. KEITH CIRCUIT " M. Dubois , " I began after a few moments , " why is it you are all the time so sad ? Me , if I were all the time on the stage with a nymph , I would not be sad . Especially traveling all over the world and seeing beautiful scenery . " The Faun stopped making up and regarded my reflection in his dressing-table mirror . " You say this , mon petit , because you are not an actor . " " Someday , maybe , I will be an actor . " " Better to die young , " said the Faun gloomily . " An actor is not so bad , " I countered . " It is better than to be a grocer and have , all the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or to be an umpire of baseball and be struck with old eggs . " " My wife and I , too , have been struck with old eggs . Soon the  | time is coming , if you ask me , when we will be struck again . " I waited patiently while he placed artificial hoofs on his feet . " If it is so sad to be a faun chasing a nymph , why do you do it ? " I questioned . M. Dubois said : " Ptah ! " as if h ? were removing a fly who had drowned in the cognac from his tongue . " Eh ? " I persisted . " Why ? " " Ptah ! Ptah ! " the Faun repeated . I waited for a long time while M. Dubois regarded his long face in the mirror . At length he turned to me again . " Ah , well , " he said wistfully , " often I have imagined to myself how it would be to appear on the stage wearing a suit of red-andwhite checkers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and funny sayings all over the world . Never again to chase across the stage a fat nymph in many coats of cheesecloth . Yes , I have imagined it to myself in every province in Canada , in every state in the U.S.A. , in Australia , and in the music halls in London . Ptah ! " " And why not ? " I asked eagerly . " Look , already I can dance , no ? I can sing , too : By the sea , by the sea , by the beautiful sea . . . You and me , you and me . . . oh , how happy we 'll beeeee ! ' " For a goat , M. Dubois did not have so bad a voice . " And as to the funny sayings , I have them by the million . I make them up myself . Here we have a shop to sell pets . There arrives a young girl who wishes a beautiful singing bird . I show her many birds . At last there is one which is a beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one is a beautiful singer but it has only one leg . ' " Ah , well , ma'mselle , ' I say , make up your mind . Do you wish a singer or a dancer ? ' " I laughed heartily .  | " So , you see , " he went on , some of the sadness disappearing from his eyes , " I have everything ! " " Then , why not ? " I said once more . " Ah , why not ? " he repeated dully . " The faun is an old faun who can not even keep up with the music , even though your father plays it as slowly as possible . And the nymph is a fat nymph whom no faun would really chase , anyway . " He pulled a few hairs aimlessly from his shaggy thighs . Then , after a stiff drink of cognac , he jumped to his hoofs . " What , " he shouted loudly , " is a woman for , anyway ? " I shrugged . " To take care of babies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the beds , to kiss good night . . . some other things , maybe . " " But not , " M. Dubois insisted , after another taste of brandy , " to run around in public dressed in cheesecloths which ripple from the fat ! " " Mais non ! " I agreed . The Faun was about to continue his oration when his wife 's voice was heard as she came downstairs from the stage entrance . He put the top on the cognac bottle and was about to slide it furtively into his trunk under a book whose title , I noticed , was Ten Thousand Funny Jokes . He stopped abruptly . " Regard me ! " he commanded . I regarded . " Am I , " he went on bravely , " a mouse or a man ? " " A faun , " I said . " Ah , well , a faun is more than a man , no ? " " Yes , a faun is a man , but he is strong and wild like an animal , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bien , " he agreed solemnly . He put the bottle back on the dressing table and removed the top . Then he sat down calmly and crossed his arms and his hoofs . In a moment the nymph , wearing a large straw hat full of red  | roses and a dress covered with painted morning glories , appeared .. She removed her long , wine-colored gloves and with one of them slapped M. Dubois across the face . " LaSalle , " she squealed in the accent of the London music halls , " you 've bean drinkin ' ! " " C'est correct , " the Faun replied calmly . " Dow n't leave me catch you at it agayn ! " she shouted . She now began to remove the morning-glory dress over her head . I observed with interest . When the removal was almost complete she placed her red head through an opening and asked : " ' Ow hold are you ? " Not yet twelve , " I assured her . " Get hout ! " she ordered . I hesitated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and got down off the trunk . The bell had rung , anyway , for the first act of acrobats , and I was just as glad to leave . I went , as usual , through the little door of the orchestra pit while the house lights were still up . I climbed carefully over the brass rail with the deep-red velvet curtain that separated the orchestra chairs from the theater proper . This was my method of announcing to the audience that , while I was one of them in fact , my heart really belonged on the other side of the footlights . My silent announcement over , I took a seat behind where Papa would presently tap his baton on the metal lampshade and the overture would begin . The acrobats were , as always , wonderful . The three sisters , beautiful beyond description , who came next , and sang popular songs , were , of course , divine . Two colored boys with faces like milk chocolate danced as if they wore chocolate wings under  | their white suits . The fourth act , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wavings of the Tricolor , and a personal appearance of Napoleon Bonaparte . At last came the Faun and the Nymph . The spring music began . The Faun seated himself on a cardboard rock and pretended to play pipes . Pretty soon the Nymph came to tickle him under the chin and make him nervous . Of course , Mme Dubois was no longer enveloped in morning glories . She was draped now in cheesecloth . I regarded her with new eyes since my conversation with her husband . He was , indeed , right . She was too fat for a nymph , and the many cheesecloths made it worse . After the tickling , the Faun arose , threw down his pipes , and jumped up and down , chasing the Nymph , who bounced and quivered across the wooden grass until she hid herself , at last , behind a paper tree whose trunk shook with her weight . The Faun pretended he had lost the Nymph . He shaded his eyes and made as if to be seeking her . Then he went back sadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pipes . But is the Nymph satisfied ? She runs away , but when he stops chasing she comes back . She sneaks up behind him and waves a cheesecloth under his nose . Up he jumps again . Away bounds the Nymph , shaking the woods . This goes on for a long , long time until everyone in the audience is coughing and moving feet about restlessly . To myself I said : " I can understand M. Dubois now . This is a sad business chasing nymphs . This does not bring anybody fun . All over the world M. Dubois chases a nymph who makes him nervous when he wishes only to play the pipes . The worst part is that he never catches her . "  | I felt sorry for the middle-aged Faun . This day , however , was the day on which I had no reason to be sorry for M. Dubois . For , on this day , the act was to be different than it had ever been before . The Faun , at last , threw down his pipes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his hoofs for a while . Mme Dubois nervously waved the cheesecloth under his nose and M. Dubois threw down his head not like a faun but like a bull ! With a mighty bound he charged after the Nymph . It was so real the audience burst into applause , as when the cowboys suddenly nearly catch up with the Indians .  | The Nymph quickly jumped over some cardboard rocks and behind the shelter of a paper tree . The Faun was right after her . He pushed over the rocks with one foot . He tore up the tree by the roots , so to speak . The Nymph , astounded , fled off one side of the stage , cheesecloth flying . The Faun ran swiftly after her . She reappeared at the other side of the stage , dashing across the front . She was not , however , fast enough for the Faun , who , running behind her , lifted one foot expertly and planted it firmly in the round , fat backside of the Nymph . The curtain came down swiftly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud applause ; cheers , and whistles , the curtain did not go up again on the Faun and the Nymph . It did not ever again . Months later , when I had almost forgotten M. Dubois , I was once more in my front row , center , munching my sugar disks , when I noticed on the program an act marked ; LASALLE DUBOIS Songs , Dances , Funny Sayings I waited excitedly for his entrance , remembering the sad days of the Faun and the Nymph . Yes , there he was , looking ten years younger and wearing the costume he dreamed of : red-and-white-checkered suit and a bright green hat . He danced out from the wings briskly , singing : " By the sea , by the sea , by the beautiful sea . . . " as a gorgeous bathing beauty followed him , swinging her hips as no fat nymph had ever done . Alone , I applauded .  | A few minutes later , M. Dubois was running a bird store and the beautiful girl , now dressed with much chic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful singer . After much hesitation she chose one which M. Dubois assured her was the world 's finest singer . " Maybe , " the girl said , " but this bird has only one leg . " " Ah , well , " replied M. Dubois , " make up your mind , ma'mselle . Do you wish a singer or a dancer ? " I laughed so loudly Papa was forced to turn around and reach over the rail to rap me gently on the head with his baton . I did not care . I was happy . All was well in the world of makebelieve . Fauns , I told myself , we do not need . What we need in this world are men in bright suits and hats with beautiful girls and songs , dances and funny sayings .  | The Note One wishes always to forget the incidents of the past wherein the pain of disillusionment was felt . Saddest of all are the little events which mark a moment when the small , confused mind realizes vaguely and yet with certitude that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through which one must walk forever in loneliness , unaccompanied by those whom one loves even the most . It was the error of the note which cut that painful message sharply across my heart . Always , in the second-last grade of grammar school ( when our principal was ill and a new one took his place temporarily ) , I was afraid of Mr. Marks . Always I felt he was waiting for me there in his room , the thick strap in his hand , waiting to slap and sting at the first sign of joy in me . I do not know quite why I was so afraid of Mr. Marks . He was , perhaps , the first man I ever knew in whose eyes there were  | cruelty and a shining hatred . My uncles were mad , perhaps , but they were , in their illogical way , tender and gracious . M. LaBelle , if he cheated me for a while out of the enormous Easter egg , was guilty only of carelessness . Papa , at his worst , was only faintly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps . So it was with most men . If any of them were , at times , cruel or unkind , it was something for which they were later sorry . With Mr. Marks I had always the feeling that he enjoyed whatever pain he could inflict on the world of small boys and girls over which he held dominion . I could not speak to Maman and Papa about this . They would have told me it was my imagination , and Maman would have added : " Just be good and always tell the truth and nothing will harm you . " In the schoolroom there were desks with wooden tops that went up and down . They were close enough together , these desks , so that you could pass notes . Since there were no joy and laughter inside the school you wrote notes about the happy things outside the school . You passed them to anybody . It did not matter to whom . I did not write notes . I wished always to be a good boy in school because Maman was so sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say : " The less he learns in school , the less he will have to forget later . " But Maman would smile in a melancholy way that hurt my heart . So , for the most part , I wrinkled my forehead over a pulppaper  | pad with blue lines , a soft pad in which the pencil made the grooves of words that were only faintly marked in my mind . My face would be screwed up , often , with the determination to learn things so that Maman would be pleased and so that someday I would be as smart as anybody and as strong . Once in a while I would say to myself : " Someday I will be smart and have a suit of long pants like Mr. Marks and then I will beat him with a strap . " I was thinking this one day when Miss Short called me out of my determination . The way she commanded me made my heart jump with a faint fear . " Come here ! " she spluttered , her blue make-believe teeth splashing drops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I went up to her desk , my face burning . I put one hand nervously into the pocket of my short knee pants . " Take your hand out of your pocket ! " Miss Short shouted . I thought angrily : I wish I had teeth like hers ; I would spray right back in her bleary eyes . " Did you hear me ? " she repeated . " Oui , ma'mselle , " I replied . I took my hand , trembling , from my pocket and rubbed the curve of my face , wishing I was grown like Mr. Marks and had always a blackness of beard on my cheeks . Miss Short took a folded , wrinkled , faded piece of lesson paper from her flat bosom . There came with it the odor of dead lavender , which made me wrinkle my nose unhappily . Miss Short handed me the paper . She looked at me as if her eyes were small , sharp knives . The world at home , I thought , unhappily , is not like this . I regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had little or no meaning . They were the words boys sometimes write on fences in chalk . I did not know their meaning or care . Once  | or twice when I had said such words at home , Maman had told me one did not say such things . Papa had laughed and observed that if I must say them I should learn the French equivalents as they were considerably more graceful . " Did you write this note ? " Miss Short asked . " I am giving you a chance to tell the truth . " " I accept this chance , " I replied . " No , I did not write this note . " I said it as simply as if Maman had asked me whether or not I had finished my lessons . " No , " I repeated . " I did not . " I turned to go away . At home if I said no , Maman said : " All right , then . " Miss Short grasped my blouse and pulled me back . Some small girl in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commanded . She turned to me and rapped the side of my face sharply with the pointer . My face stung and I felt ill . " Do n't lie to me , " Miss Short squealed . " I do not lie , " I answered , very puzzled . " I do not have to lie . Je ne l ' ? cris pas . " It seemed so simple to me . I did not write it . What more need be said ? Miss Short hit me again with the pointer , harder than before . I wished to pick up a book and smash her head , but I did not . " Sally O'Hare says you wrote it ! " Miss Short cried triumphantly . " She found it beside your desk . " I turned and regarded a skinny little girl with a red face and pigtails ; the girl who , in the winter , threw snowballs at me for no reason I knew . I shrugged . " Sally is wrong . I did not write it . " Sally jumped up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " Wrote it , " Miss Short said . " Wrote it , " Sally corrected .  | My head began to swim and my face was like fire . The world seemed to tremble . " I do not know who wrote it or who found it or where , ma'mselle . But , me , I did not write it . " " Come with me , " Miss Short said sharply . I gasped and looked around . Sally made a face at me . I was very much afraid of Mr. Marks and that , I knew , was where Miss Short was taking me . Dear Lord , I said , You know as well as I do that I did not write this note . What is wrong up there ? Why do You let these things happen ? Is there no sense in anything ? Who has not asked such questions ? Who has ever obtained a satisfactory answer ? I did not , for sure . There was Mr. Marks sitting behind the desk . He needed a shave as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was , I thought , like God . Yes , the Lord and Mr. Marks are alike . God sees the little sparrow fall and He lets it fall . God and Mr. Marks , thdy do not care . If God cares , will He please assure Mr. Marks I did not write this foolish note ? " It is about the dirty note , " Miss Short said , blushing , and yet , I think , happy to be able to discuss such a subject . She took my ear and thrust me before God , who spat accurately and calmly into an earthly cuspidor . Mr. Marks pointed a long , hairy finger at me as in the Bible pictures . " You wrote that note ! " he declared . " Tell the truth . That 's all we want here  --  the truth ! " I shook my head . How , I thought , can I tell the truth when I have already told the truth and no one believes me ? Are there two truths , perhaps ? Or more ? Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It became like a song , singing in my mind , a song that I could not stop . " The truth ! " Mr. Marks repeated . " The truth is , " I said wearily , " that I did not write the note . " " Hold out your hand , " said Mr. Marks . I held out my hand . Mr. Marks took the thick strap from his desk and beat me until my hand was red and swollen and there were tears in my eyes . Miss Short watched him , smiling at him and nodding her head . " You are coming in here every day at this time and I am going to ask you about the note until you tell the truth ! " Mr. Marks told me . Miss Short , of course , beamed in approval . Every day I went to Mr. Marks and I said : " No , I did not write the note . That is the truth . " Then I held out my hand for the strap . The world disappeared in those days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncles and the vaudeville shows and Maman and Papa  --  they were all there , but it was as if I were separated from them by a thick film which stretched with my hands and would not let me ever touch them . There was nothing in the world but Mr. Marks and the strap and the note and such things . The world had become a piece of foolish , crumpled paper smelling of dead lavender . Even when I looked through the best glass of all of the manycolored window , it was not truly rose any more ; it was red , it seemed , like the fires of hell . One day Maman said : " You are n't eating very much any more . Are you ill ? " " No , I am not ill , Maman , " I replied . " Is something wrong , perhaps , at school ? Tell Maman . You  | can tell Maman , you know . You are not so big yet that Maman will not understand . " I waited . I wondered . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come to seem so big and bad . " Tell Maman , " she repeated kindly . I could hold the pain in my heart no longer . I told Maman the truth . I told her about the note and about Mr. Marks and every day the strap and how , every day too , the world was in a hot fog . I waited then for assurance , for complete , understanding faith . I waited to be returned again to the world of my laughing uncles and the apple tree and the wine and the music of Papa 's violin . I was not returned . Maman hugged me a little and smiled gently . " Are you sure , bibi , you did not write the note ? " I wanted to cry until I could be sick and fall asleep in her arms . I opened my mouth to speak , but words did not come . She continued quietly , as if it were a little thing , and indeed to her , perhaps , it was ; her strategy and understanding were so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punish you for nothing , bibi . Teachers do not beat little boys for fun . Perhaps you wrote it and did not remember . . . " The plates on the mantel seemed to swim around and my mother 's face was no longer loving ; it was only a blur in space . I , too , wondered now whether I had written the note or not . For a while I could not say for certain myself . " It is nothing , " Maman said , hugging me . " You are making , as your father says , an elephant out of a mouse . Just go to Mr. Marks and tell him the truth . Tell him you wrote the note and you forgot about it and when you remembered you were afraid .  | Tell him you are sorry . That 's all anyone wishes you to do . Then everything will be all right . " The next day I told Mr. Marks , yes , I had written the note and I was sorry and I would not again write such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had all forgotten about it . All except me.  | Six Beauties My uncle Desmonde announced abruptly one day that he expected to die presently . This was a common announcement in our family , of course , and no one paid much attention . Desmonde , however , persisted , and in time we began to consider his case with a certain amount of seriousness . " It is true , " Papa said , " that the blood pressure of Desmonde is greatly elevated . " " That 's dangerous , " Maman said . " You never can tell in cases like that . I hate to mention it , but you remember jean Dubuc went like that . " " Jean Dubuc , " Papa observed , " went comme ? a only after he had filled himself with ale and fallen into a lake . " " Still , " Maman insisted , " if his blood pressure had been low ... "  | She shook her head as if to say we might still have had Jean Dubuc with us . " The sideboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , " my father agreed . " He eats all the time . Still , it is better than robbing a bank or marrying a woman with twelve small children . " " Who is doing that ? " Maman inquired nervously . " No one , " Papa replied . " I merely make a comparison . " " Anyway , " Maman said , " to eat so much rich food as Desmonde does is to encourage sudden death . " A few days later , surely enough , Desmonde had a fainting spell . He fell suddenly to the floor while reaching for a bottle of vin ordinaire . For a while we left him undisturbed , thinking him merely tired . Soon Papa noticed , as did I , that Desmonde 's face had become a peculiar color , and we called the doctor . The doctor immediately ordered Desmonde to a diet of wet toast and warm milk plus , here and there , a mushed egg , barely cooked . It was like taking wings from a bird . " Begone , vulture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the malady . " " Take my word for it , " the doctor said . " Your blood pressure is like the weather in Ecuador . " " Go ! faker , quack , medicine man . " The doctor shrugged and fastened up his small black bag . " My fee is four dollars , " he said coldly . " Why ? " Desmonde inquired with narrowed eyes . " Why ? " the doctor repeated , puzzled . " Yes . Did I steal your stethoscope ? " ' Very well , " the doctor agreed . " Three dollars . Let us have no  | arguments . I do n't feel very well myself . " Desmonde handed him two dollars . " You may keep the change , " he explained , leading the medico to the door . " Believe me , " said the doctor , " I'hope you drop dead before I get home . " When the doctor was gone , Desmonde regarded us all plaintively . " Why , " he inquired , " does he not wish me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make my blood pressure zero ? " He continued to eat highly spiced foods and to drink too much wine and to insist daily that he was dying and that he did not care since to live on wet toast , warm milk , and mushed eggs was a fate worse than death . After a while the wine and the food and the pressure seemed to rise to Desmonde 's head , because he began to confide to us the strange manner in which he wished to die . Only my mother , whom he did not wish to shock too much , remained innocent of his dream . We promptly called a family conference . Desmonde was not present , so we spoke freely around the table with the red-fringed cloth . " Consider , " Uncle Felix announced , after the preliminaries had been dispensed with , " the scandal . " " The scandal , " Papa replied , " is more important to you than the death of your brother . Consider this . If he remains quietly seated on the wet toast and mushed eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he attempts to carry out his plan , his teeth will surely stop aching permanently ! " Felix stretched out his hands helplessly . " Make no mistake : he will kill himself , anyway . Is it necessary  | he do it with such fervor and publicity ? " He looked at me , as if for help . I shrugged . " I do n't know , " I said . I did not know much about these things and I was interested only in the outcome , as at a cinema serial . My mother spoke now , gently : " If he is bent on dying , then he should have his last wishes granted , I think . " Uncle Louis scratched his red nose . " J'en suis tout bleu , " he said . I sat up at this . For Uncle Louis to be flabbergasted was indeed a rarity . " It is also doubtful , " Felix explained , pointing a fork at Papa , " that Desmonde can find six of the most beautiful girls in Canada for such a venture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Desmonde can hire artists ' models . Who is more beautiful ? What is the difference to an artists ' model if she poses for a picture or eats dinner ? It is enough if she receives her fee and is not harmed in any way . N'est-ce pas ? " " Why , " I inquired earnestly , " should Desmonde harm any-body ? " " You are too young , " Papa replied . " How old are you ? " " Haha ! Mon p  --  re ! He asks me how many years I have ! " " I can not remember everything , " my father said . " Anyway , beyond a doubt you are too young to know . " Uncle Louis ran his fingers around the curves of his ears . " And Desmonde is too old , " he said . " So we do not have to worry about that . " " Desmonde is not so old , " Maman observed from across the room . " He is past one hundred in the glands , " Felix said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trunk , with a horse it is the teeth , with a man it is the glands . " " And with a woman ? " Maman laughed .  | " A woman , " said Papa , " is never over thirty-nine . If she is your wife , she is never over thirty . " " Anyway , " said Maman , flushing with pleasure , " Desmonde is not so old . He is still young enough to enjoy the normal activities of life . I do n't see him in a wheel chair . " " Listen to her sing ! " Papa chuckled . " She does not know of what we are speaking , yet she sings and sings . She is like a bird . A bird sings and has no idea of what it is singing . " " Then tell me , " my mother said coldly . She put down a pair of my knickerbockers she was mending . " I know , of course , that there is a secret . " My father looked around carefully at the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " Desmonde has it in his head to die , as you know . He now has arrived at the point where he wishes to die in style . It is not enough for my brother to merely die . With him there must be a pageant . " " If he dies in the true Christian manner what is the difference ? " Maman asked . " Sing on ! " Papa laughed . " The true Christian manner , eh ? The Beautiful Ending , ' eh ? Do not imagine any such thing to yourself , my hummingbird . " " Hummingbirds , " I said , " do not sing . " " With their feet , " Felix corrected , " they sing . " " Are we , " my father asked , somewhat irked , " to discuss the beautiful death of Desmonde or the feet of hummingbirds ? " Everyone was silent . My father spoke once more to my mother : " Desmonde wishes to have a fine dinner on his last day on earth . The main dish of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trout cooked in wine and served with iced grapes . There will also be hot cheesecake , truffles leek soup , and so forth . The Last Menu is quite complete , believe me ! " Maman moistened her lips .  | " It sounds good , " she said . " The rest , " said Papa ominously , " does not sound so good . " He looked around at the others , and they all smiled mysteriously . Papa 's glance fell on me again and he raised his brows with a certain hesitation . " How old did you say you were ? " " Since I have no glands , " I laughed , " what difference ? " " Hmm , " murmured my father . " Well , you are too young " for this to harm you . Eh , mes fr  --  res ? " He looked around at the others again . They nodded in agreement . I took a deep , satisfactory breath . Papa went on : " Desmonde wishes , you understand , to have a wine with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct . He has not yet named the wines , since he is not on certain ground when it comes to the wines , which must be exactly right . This banquet , you see , is to be exquisite in all respects . How many times in his life does a man die ? Eh ? " " I myself , " interrupted Felix , " am a good judge of wines . It is a wonder Desmonde does not consult me . To judge wines one needs a tongue of the rarest sort . To judge exquisite wines one needs an exquisite tongue . " " One needs also the exquisite wines , " Papa laughed . " To tell you the truth , " Maman said . " It all sounds quite pleasant to me . " " Ah , but wait . . . wait , my dove . Imagine this to yourself ! Desmonde wishes as his dinner companions the six most beautiful girls in Canada . Or perhaps not the six most beautiful . Perhaps six of the most beautiful . Anyway , six beauties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood pressure , and dies . Ha ! " And why not ? " Maman smiled . " Beautiful girls , I understand , are the best appetizers at dinner . "  | " And why not ! " my father mocked , leaning back in his chair and winking at the others . " Listen to her ! " Felix chided . " Oho ! " said Uncle Louis , " they are moving the furniture out of her head . Soon will come in the butterflies ! " Papa now spoke softly and mysteriously . " It is the way Desmonde wishes the beautiful girls to dress ! " " And how is that ? " Maman encouraged . My father took a deep breath and swallowed hard . " They must wear , " he said in a precise tone , " a large picture hat of the garden-party type . The hat they must keep on while eating . " He spoke slowly , relishing the details of his presentation . Maman said : " That is the old fashion , but it is , nonetheless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So ! Imagine this , then : they must wear long black gloves which reach up past the elbows , and long black silk stockings of what is called the opera length . " He showed with a gesture on his trousers about where the stockings would reach . Maman became slightly pink , but she spoke gaily : " It all sounds very delightful . What else ? " " What else what ? " Papa asked , grinning broadly . " What else must the beautiful girls wear ? " " Haha ! " laughed Felix . " What else ! " " Oho ! " said Louis . " What else ! " I squirmed in my chair anxiously . " Well , " I demanded , " what else ? " " You are too young , " Papa said . Everybody laughed at this , except , of course , Maman . " I do wish you would tell me what else , " she remarked crisply . Papa leaned back and downed a large glass of red wine . When  | he was finished he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Nothing . " " Nothing ? " Maman repeated . " Nothing , " said Papa , Louis , and Felix in unison .  | There was a long silence . Maman spoke after a while and without looking at us . " Perhaps , " she suggested uneasily and with a sharp and wondering glance at me , " perhaps we had better have the Reverend McKintosh speak to Desmonde . " " McKintosh ? " repeated Felix . " McKintosh ? There was a McKintosh who invented a mechanism for tipping the hat at a lady without removing the hands from the pockets . It worked , I believe , by steam . Although this seems impossible . Then there was ... " " The minister of the Presbyterian church , of course , " Maman stated . " Where bibi used to go to Sunday school . Bibi , perhaps , had better start again . " " In the winter , " I agreed . " When come the Christmas parties . " " No McKintosh , " Papa said . " Mais non ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of his life on scones and breakfast tea and read , every day , a dozen chapters from the New Testament . To sit on wet toast first . . . and then to lay on scones and tea , reading the New Testament . . . bah ! Why should a man live at all if that is what he must do ? Also , a Presbyterian would not be expected to know about the subtleties of wines , truffles , hot cheesecake , and beautiful girls in picture hats and opera-length , black silk stockings . " " Who then ? " asked Maman . " Only a priest , " my father replied , " would know if this is good . A priest is compassionate . A priest has the understanding of human frailty without the dryness in the heart of the Protestant clergy . " " Ah . Bon ! Bon ! " exclaimed Felix . " Always , in the history of the world , the priest has stood . . . " " Good , " interrupted Louis . " Father Sebastian ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Felix . " Father Sebastian knows everything ... " " Except which is the right way to Paradise , " Louis amended . " Tomorrow , then , " Papa said , " I will invite Father Sebastian to discuss with us Uncle Desmonde 's farewell banquet . " We were , of course , all gathered together while my father told the story to Father Sebastian . The Father listened attentively , solemnly tapping a finger to his under lip every now and then , and murmuring frequent " ahs . " " And so , " my father concluded , " we wish your advice . What do you think of it ? Is it bad ? Is it an evil thing to do ? Or is it good ? " The priest reflected a long time , crossing and uncrossing his legs , tapping his mouth thoughtfully , looking often into nowhere , dreamily , a faint smile flickering on his shining face . " Hmmmmmm , " he murmured finally . I tugged nervously on my stocking . My mother moistened her lips . Papa lit a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sebastian . " Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm ! " he repeated . " Wine . . . brook trout . . . truffles . . . hot cheesecake . . . iced grapes . . . and so forth . Hmmmm ... picture hats . . . black gloves to the elbow ... stockings of the opera length ... Hmmmmmm . " " So ? " questioned my father , eagerly and solemnly . " Will it be good ? " " It will all depend . . . " Father Sebastian ordained at length . " On what ? " asked my father nervously . " On the choice of wines , " Father Sebastian concluded .  | The Pinnacle of Fame Uncle Desmonde never had his banquet , alas . Papa said it was almost impossible to find both the trout and the girls simultaneously , but the truth was that Desmonde soon fell in love again , this time with an actress at the Casino Burlesque , a young lady whose can-can revealed such alluring ornate garters Desmonde could not resist her . In consequence Desmonde recovered completely , it being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did not conquer all , at least cured all . I make an exception of myself to this law . For love nearly always gave me dizzy and foolish spells . Sally , the little girl who had caused me so much trouble with Mr. Marks and his thick strap , was again , in a subtle manner , the instigator of one of my most dizzy actions . I use the word " dizzy " literally . For a long time I was not permitted by Maman to play in the streets and the yards near by . It was my mother 's contention that  | I was too nervous and fragile to play with the neighborhood huskies on equal terms . But Sally . who , in less than a year , had sprouted considerably , would often stand in my alleyway and shout tomboy taunts at me for not joining the others . In her eyes ; sometimes , when she laughed at me and made fun of my spindly legs , there were strange little lights like the candles we lit at home for afternoon tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too young for anything more dangerous and refreshing than playing follow-the-leader with boys or taunting them or throwing apples at them . I had no way of knowing why the thought of Sally made me wish to do things . Her face was forever covered with mud . Her hair was as lifeless and wild as the end of my mother 's mop . Her clothes were always wrinkled and her legs bruised and scratched . Only her green eyes , flecked with small violet specks , were clean and shining . Sitting under the apple tree in my yard , playing games with imaginary friends , I would often see her clambering over the lumber piles and the sheds and barns in back of Mr. Fairbirn 's house . I would then lose interest in the golden treasure for which I dug or the armies of Napoleon I routed . I would yearn for true adventure in a real world  --  falling down , bumping my head , scratching my legs like Sally , tearing my blouse as she tore her skirt . " Maman , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the Fairbirns ' back yard and play follow-the-leader with them . " " Why , " my mother asked mildly , " is it so necessary ? " My father , who was eating his lunch before going to play the matin  --  e , regarded me with interest . " All of a sudden , pouf ! " he chuckled , " it is necessary ? " " Yes . I wish to play like the other boys . I am not a baby any more . I do not wish to spend all my life sitting under a tree . "  | " Under a tree , " Papa remarked , pouring himself steaming , black coffee , " once sat a scientist . When an apple struck him on the head he became famous . It is not necessary to go someplace else to become a great man . " " I do not speak about becoming a ' great man . I wish only to go and become a boy of my age . " " Can you not become a boy of your age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I will be careful not to break any legs , " I promised . My father laughed and looked at me a little sadly . " Very well , " he sighed . ' Wait , " Maman commanded . " Those boys are rough , and that Sally is worse than they are . It 's very dangerous . There are tall piles of lumber . . . and horses . " My mother was afraid of mice and horses . . . and God . " Horses , " Papa reminded her , " do not eat boys , and tall piles of lumber are not the highest obstacles he will meet in the world . " My mother sighed . " Very well . But do n't tear your clothes and do n't get dirty . " " Oui , Maman . " She kissed me sadly , and I ran excitedly out of the house . At the Fairbirns ' a small crowd was gathered . They were all boys I knew casually from school and they were all much sturdier and more muscular than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would examine a green caterpillar if he found one in Maman 's tossed-up salad . They discussed me pro and con , and finally Sally broke up the debate by reminding them that since I was the weakest and most foolish I would be the one who would end up the worst and have to be punished . Such a state of affairs would give the others a certain sense of freedom from care for the day .  | I smiled confidently while Sally discussed my failings as if I were a sick cat . Name of a green cow ! I thought . She does not know me ! I felt as if I were the sorcerer in a fairy tale . The one who , in humble disguise , effects miracles of strength to prove to the arrogant that one must not look down on the seemingly humble and meek . Mais , parbleu ! a fairy tale is one thing . The great lumberyard and stable of M. Fairbirn is another . I followed the others halfway up a large pyramid of planks and then slipped and rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , later , to jump from the loft of the stable into the soft pile of straw below , even though Sally went right before me , winking at me mischievously and wrinkling her small nose . Three times I ran to the hole . Three times I stopped and looked down fearfully . It was , I surmised , a long way to the bottom , where I might soon land with both legs in pieces . Here , where I stood , both legs , however shaky , were complete . No , I said to myself , to break a leg will prove nothing . I stood up on the teeter-totter , true . But when Sally stood on the other end , sticking her tongue out at me , she jumped so that I went spinning through the air as the acrobats in the first act at Papa 's theater did . Except that the acrobats land always on a soft pad . I landed on myself in the hard clay . No use to itemize my inadequacies . I was the worst at the end by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been the best and had the choice ) , ordained that I be tied for a while to the tail of a large horse named Harry , in the stable of M. Fairbirn . The queen had spoken ! Thumbs down ! Ah , well , the horse did not like it any more than I did . The horse , however , was only angry . I was frightened to death . Brains ,  | I had been telling myself , are what count in this world . Not muscles . Now , alas , one good kick from Harry and I would have neither brains nor muscles . Outside the stall the others laughed and joked as I attempted to adjust my movements to those of the horse . I jumped out of the way when he backed up , but since where he went there went also his tail , and where his tail went there went I , it was no use . In desperation I stretched out my hand and offered him some ancient candy wafers , and he accepted them with a certain quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the wall . In the end I was released , unharmed in body but somewhat damaged in spirit and , furthermore , considerably puzzled by Sally 's profound joy in seeing me humiliated . What , I asked myself , have I ever done to her ? I went home with the taunts and the laughter of my companions ringing in my ears . " I will show them yet , " I muttered half aloud . " I will show them yet or I am as stupid as a tree stump . " I went back to the Lord again as a last resort . I even began going again to Sunday school , much to Maman 's surprise and delight . " Tell me , ma'mselle , " I asked my teacher one Sunday , " how does one acquire the strength for great feats such as to wrestle with the Devil and such ? " " Thrice-armed , " said my teacher , peering at me over her thick glasses , " is he who has faith ! When is the match ? " " What match @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , as my classmates laughed . " It is not with the Devil I wrestle , " I explained . " It is with a girl . "  | " Hmmmn , " said the teacher , removing her glasses for a better view , perhaps , of this creature before her . She returned her glasses to the bridge of her large nose and coughed uneasily . " Where were we ? " she asked nervously . " Oh , yes . . . manna was beginning to fall . . . " Eh bien , so after that I acquired faith . " I can do anything , " I told myself every morning . " I am a brave , strong hero , " I assured myself every night . " And the angels are on my side . " In time , since I did not attempt anything and so did not fail , I was certain I had enough faith to carry most of the precincts of Paradise , and that , when the moment was given me , I would astound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , astound the rest of the world also , but for some only faintly perceived reason it was Sally whom I wished most to impress . " I do not wish to intrude into your dreams , " Papa asked me one day , " but about what is it you smile all the time ? " I shrugged . " I smile because I am happy . Tra-la-la . Is it wrong to be happy and to smile ? " " Mais non ! But to smile all the time and to oneself . . . all the world knows this is a sign of a vacant apartment in the head . " " In my head the rooms are all full , " I laughed . " I am happy because I have faith and I am strong ! " Papa looked at me queerly . " Do not , please , break any iron bars with your teeth . " " You do not believe I have faith and I am strong ? " My father regarded me in silence for a moment and then smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " they say that faith can move a mountain . "  | " Ah , but it can , " I insisted . " It can , " said Papa , " perhaps . But , bibi , it never has . Com-prends ? " " Oui . " " Good . I myself have faith , and in ' your strength . I have faith you will take your strength and with it beat the rugs for poor Maman , who again has a slight attack of the inflammatory rheumatism . " " Oui , Papa , " I agreed dully . Even my father did not know that my strength was for a far-different purpose than to beat rugs . There came , one day , as there always does , the supreme moment . After school we often went to the church hall and cleared away the chairs to play basketball . Sally , too , frequently played . It was only recently I had been admitted to the games , and this because they were only nine and it was necessary to have ten to play basketball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the supreme moment . I was nervous and very bad . I was not fast enough to bounce the ball around or tall and strong enough to throw it into the basket . What is more , my stockings kept falling down and my nose kept running . In basketball these are two severe handicaps . For , while I bounced the ball awhile , sooner or later I would have to let go of it to pull up my stockings . And when someone passed to me , I was usually wiping my nose hastily on my sleeve , and received the ball on the head . Sweating and tired , after the ragged game was ended , we went out on the street and stood before the church . " Never mind , " Sally said , her face flushed and somehow pretty in spite of all the dirt on it  --  and all the anger in my heart . " Never  | mind , you 'll be a man before your mother . " Everybody thought this ancient remark was very funny . " He 'll be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do you play the fiddle , also ? " He plays a small fiddle with one string , " someone else remarked . " His hair is not yet long enough to play a large fiddle . " " He is not strong enough to hold it , " Sally said . This , alas , was too much for me . I felt red-hot inside my stomach . Uncle Louis ' butterflies began to flutter . I clenched my fists and called silently upon the Lord . " Make me find something to do . Make me find something wonderful to do , all of a sudden . Not to move a mountain , maybe , but something along those lines . Afterwards I will be very good all my life and take care of Maman and Papa when they are old and I will love my enemies . . . even Sally . " The crowd was looking at me as they saw my mouth mumbling . " He talks to himself , too , " Sally observed . " He is saying his prayers , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so he has to make up . " Aimlessly I glanced around . I noticed the cross on the steeple of the church . I surveyed the steeple . I noted the ancient , firm branches of the twisted vines which went almost to the base of the steeple . There was in my mind , then , a great white flash as Paul must have seen it on the road to Damascus . " Voil ? ! " I thought . " Fate ! Here it is before my eyes . The cross ... a sign from the angels . What better place to do a great deed than the church of the Lord ? If He does not come to my aid now , He never will . " Everyone watched me in bewilderment as I started to grasp the vines . I knew I was about to do something for which my very  | weakness fitted me . They were all too heavy for the vines to hold them . I was not . Or so I prayed . Slowly I climbed as my companions watched nervously and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no fear at all for a while . I was exultant . My heart pounded happily . My lungs were filled with intoxicating air . My legs were as light as feathers . Upward , ever upward I went , hearing but faintly from below the cries of my former detractors . They were , perhaps , crying for me to come down . I ignored them . They were afraid . I was not . I had faith ! There were moments in my climb when I could almost feel the actual presence of an angel beside me , ready to give me a boost and whispering in my ear : " Courage , we are with you . " I climbed and climbed and came at last to the base of the steeple proper . The vines now ended and there began a perilous waste of slate tiles . I looked up to the shining cross at the top . My faith was renewed . If the Lord intended me to go this far He certainly was going to see me all the way up . Onward I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must indeed have had great faith , and it must have been an angel with the surest of footing who had been pushing my derri  --  re those last few yards . For , when I looked down , I saw I had come over what was almost a sheet of glass . Down below my companions were waving and shouting . They appeared like little people in another world . Around them too , I observed , had gathered a large crowd . I was very proud . I clung happily to the cross and gazed out at the scenery . I could see the Rideau River , the Ch  --  teau Laurier , the Parliament buildings , the blue hills in the distance  --  everything ! It was all very wonderful .  | Soon , however , I began to get very hot and very thirsty . I decided to go back down . It was , unfortunately , not as easy as all that . Going up , you could cling , in certain ways , to the tiles . Coming down you were likely to slide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I thought suddenly . " If he can get down safely , so can I. " In the next feverish breath , I woefully recalled that angels have wings , schoolboys do not . I clung tightly to the cross . " Dear Lord , " I murmured , " regard me here where I have worshiped You so many Sundays . Are You going to let me fall all the way down there and become like beef roulade ? What will happen to poor Maman ? Who will take care of her when she is aged ? Eh ? " This seemed to me like a rather weak approach , and I shouted : " Zut ! " This did me no good either . My stomach was now becoming filled with more and larger butterflies than I had ever dreamed could be crowded into me . " Dear Lord " ( I decided to try again ) , " send me a messenger . A raven , perhaps , with a ladder in his beak . Or perhaps an eagle , since a raven is too small for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will memorize , in a week , twenty psalms . I promise . " That , apparently , started something in Paradise , for , far below , the Reverend McKintosh stuck his head out of the window of the manse next door . I sighed with a little feeling of relief . Here was a special envoy of le bon Dieu . Surely , he would find a solution . Half asleep , I hugged tightly onto the cross for what seemed like hours . I was brought abruptly to full consciousness by a great clanging  | of bells and the wild , mighty , insistent sounds of blaring sirens . It was the fire department ! In no time the enormous ladder came sliding up and before I could think about it , I was being carried down to safety . Once on the ground , I refused to answer questions or reveal the names of my confederates , all of whom had disappeared . Only the Reverend McKintosh received my attention . " What , " he demanded angrily and very much unlike the gen-tle representative of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning of this madness ? " The excitement had weakened my body , but it had strengthened and sharpened my mind . " My Shepherd , " I said ( this alone must have impressed him ) , " there came to me from hearing your wonderful preaching a great desire to come closer to Paradise . It was like with Saint Paul , of whom you spoke last Sunday . Even to the blinding light . I climbed , therefore , as high as I could toward heaven . Is such a thing wrong ? " He looked around nervously . The crowd was smiling and admiring my na  --  ve nobility  --  all of them , with the possible exception of the fire company . Reverend McKintosh , one could see , knew his reputation was at stake . He patted me on the sweating head . " No , my child , " he reassured , " no . But coming close to heaven is a job for the spirit . It is not necessary to take along the body , too . " " Eh bien , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too young to understand such things . N'est-ce pas ? " " Go , " the divine ordered , " and remember : too often when the spirit is willing , the flesh is weak . "  | " Mais oui , " I concurred , with only the haziest notion of what he meant . I ran all the way home and was just in time for supper , which I needed badly . Maman noticed only that my clothes were wrinkled and that I looked very tired . Papa said perhaps I had been climbing too many trees for one day . The next morning as I was devouring my oatmeal , Maman made a small sound of annoyance . " What a thing ! " she exclaimed . She was reading The Morning Citizen . " The world gets crazier and crazier . Listen : ' Unknown Boy Climbs Church Steeple . On Way to Heaven , He Tells Minister . ' " Papa grinned and blew gently on his black coffee . " Only about bibi 's age , too , " Maman went on . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daring age . Perhaps , on the other hand , he is crazy . " " If you ask me , " my mother said , " he probably comes from a home where the parents do not show him enough love or interest and he wished to escape these bad people and go to heaven . " A large lump of oatmeal stuck for a moment in my throat at this elegant explanation of my mother 's . " C'est possible , " Papa noted . " Such parents , " insisted Maman , quite worked up by now , " should be in jail ! " My father turned to me . " What do you think , bibi ? You are about the age and small size of this daredevil of divine inspirations , no ? " " Moi ? Sais pas . I myself do not like to climb since I become  | dizzy . Tell me , Papa , how is the new show this week ? Do we have any good acrobats ? " My mother went into the kitchen with some dishes . Papa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After a lengthy draught of this hot , dark beverage , he sighed . " The Reverend McKintosh called this morning , " he said quietly . " Oh ! " I gulped a piece of my toast . " Was it , " I inquired , about the picnic ? " " Mais non . It was not about the picnic . " " Ah , perhaps about the many Bible verses I have memorized . He wishes , perhaps , to make a gold star after my name ? " Papa stared at me until my eyes blinked and I lowered my gaze to the table . " The next time , " Papa said softly , " you wish to show off , take along with your faith a ladder and some rope . You understand ? " " Yes , " I agreed , sticking my nose even more deeply into the oatmeal bowl .  | That Syrian Kid One day in the early winter after the summer of the church steeple , I was sitting on a kitchen chair , removing my skates and warming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play with that Syrian kid , you understand ? " Maman said . " Pourquoi ? " I felt the edge of my skate and noticed a dullness . " Because he is . . . well , let us say , he is n't nice . He 's a foreigner . " She reddened a little . " We , too , are mostly foreigners . Only Desmonde is British because of fighting once in the cavalry . Tony is born in Canada and his Papa is a citizen even if he speaks mostly Syrian . " I knew , of course , that my mother was not speaking of Tony 's status in the nation . His foreignness was in his dark face , his lustiness , and his shining black hair . " His manners , " explained Maman , " are foreign . His customs . "  | " Us , too , " I persisted . " The Canadians do not collect garters as Uncle Desmonde . They do not have fear of butterflies like Louis . They do not ... " Papa , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blew dust from under the instrument 's bridge and said casually : " Tony is perhaps not so bad . His father sells the best apples in Ottawa . " " His father , " I added eagerly , " polishes each apple separately . " " I hope , " Maman said nervously , " he does not spit on them . " " Oh , no , " I said firmly . " Apples or no apples , no good will come of associating with him . He is wild and uncontrollable , the teachers say . They wish , some of them , that Mr. Marks was back and would give him a few good beatings . Mr. Cone is altogether too easy . That is what they say . " At the mention of Mr. Marks , who had drawn with his whip a great black X across a part of my faith in mankind , I winced . Then I laughed . " What are you laughing at ? " asked Maman . " If Mr. Marks tried to beat Tony , Tony would kick him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maman firmly , " is just what I meant ! " Maman was , alas , correct , in a manner of speaking . We passed around in school one day a copy of La Vie parisienne , with its luscious , graceful pink girls swinging joyfully from trees , with long legs pointing heavenward , dancing merrily on lawns , exhibiting the can-can  --  all of them in a state close to delicious peach-colored nudity . Miss Grey , who taught one section of the last grade , caught us . Miss Grey was almost as severe as Miss Short , except that her teeth were her own .  | " To whom , " she inquired , turning scarlet and tearing the magazine from Tony 's hands , " does this wretched paper belong ? " " Ce gazette est ? mon oncle Desmonde , " I stood up and replied . I spoke French because it always irritated Miss Grey . " Speak English . This is an English nation , in case you have not yet learned it . " " The magazine , " I repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful women . All my uncles and also my father love beautiful women . " " And I suppose , " Miss Grey said savagely , " your uncle Desmonde is teaching an innocent child to also love beautiful naked women ? " " Yes , ma'am , " I replied calmly . If Mr. Marks ' whip had disillusioned me , it had also made me lose my fear of any other teachers . I had come to understand , I think , that it was just as well to tell the truth , however revolutionary it might be , since large people would always beat small people , in any event . The best chance was for the small people to be as brave as the big and perhaps frighten them a little . " He does , does he ? " Miss Grey said , slamming La Vie parisienne down hard on the desk and making a loud , frightening noise . " It is not necessary that they be naked , " I said . " Just so they are beautiful . My uncle Desmonde once thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company of six beautiful women , all of whom would wear nothing but black stockings , gloves , and a large hat ... " " Silence ! " Miss Grey shouted so loudly that the spectacles fell off her nose and hung , dangling , across her circular fa  --  ade . I had another reason for not being afraid . I knew Miss Grey  | was aware that Maman was an imposing power in the Presbyterian church , of which Miss Grey was a member who sang alto badly in the choir . I knew , too , that any schism in the Presbyterian ranks would find my mother swaying a much larger group than Miss Grey , if  | only because Maman cooked so much better for the Ladies ' Aid . Miss Grey , I am sure , felt all this , too . She was obviously searching in her mind for a scapegoat . Naturally , and as usual in such cases , she picked on a helpless minority : Tony . " You , " she said to me , " are perhaps too young to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Tony is old enough to know better ! " " I am old enough to know better , too , " I protested . " It is my fault . " Miss Grey drew herself up haughtily . " I will decide whose fault it is ! " She made Tony remain after school that evening and write on the blackboard 1000 times : I WILL GO AND SIN NO MORE . When I came home I discovered that someone had told my mother of the incident . " You see , " she remonstrated , " I told you that Syrian Kid would get you into trouble . " " It was I who got him into trouble La Vie parisienne , she would have said , Oh , well , he is too young to know of such things . ' " " But , Maman , I am not too young . I am no longer an innocent . I do not believe I was brought to you in the black bag of the doctor . " " Your face , " my mother observed nervously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on the towel . The towel is for drying . What is more , I forbid you to play with Tony . I forbid . Com-prends-tu ? " I sighed . " Oui , " I said . " But he did not do anything wrong . " " It does not matter . He is always suspected . Now go and wash your face . Your hands , too . " I went to the bathroom , my loyalties divided . To have dear  | friends who do not understand each other is an unhappy thing . For a week I kept away from Tony purposely . When the weather was nice I did not go out for recess . I stayed in and cleaned blackboards . I wanted , for the good of my mother , to be on the best terms with the teachers , most of whom were members of the Ladies ' Aid . On rainy days , I stayed in the basement and played " marbles " with cigarette pictures of cinema stars , carefully avoiding my Syrian friend , who went outdoors at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day as I was skating home from school on the hard-packed snow of the sidewalk . " Hey ! " he shouted . " You hurt your skates on the rough sidewalk . " He caught up with me and stopped me . A small smile came on his dark , glistening face . He looked very much like a smallboy Valentino : dark eyes , dark , good-looking face , black , shiny hair , and white , white teeth . " Hello , " I said weakly . " Ca va ? " " Me , I 'm all right . You , too ? " " C'est bon bien . " " You do n't buy bananas from my old man lately , huh ? Or apples ? You used to buy every day the biggest apple . No more . " I hurried on . " No , " I replied dully . " No more . " Tony hurried alongside me in that curious , almost bowlegged gait of his . " Your mother do n't send you no more to my old man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I lied . ' We found a store nearer . On Augusta Street . " Tony looked up at me and smiled pleasantly . " Augusta Street ai n't nearer . "  | " It . . . it 's . . . sort of downhill , " I said . Without changing his tone and smiling as pleasantly as before , he asked : " Did I do something ? Did I say something ? " He spoke humbly and with the sweet , strong confidence of the truly humble . " No . You did nothing . You said nothing . " He put his hand around my shoulder and stopped me . " I know , " he said with a little wrinkle of pain between his black , thick eyebrows . " Your mother say : Tony , there 's a bum . He do n't speak good . He do n't dress good . He do n't look like a citizen . ' Is that Tony 's fault ? Tony does n't have no mother . Tony 's old man do n't speak good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if your old man spoke Syrian he would find out my old man knows everything in the world  --  in Syrian : poetry , jokes , songs . Tony 's got a king of Syria in his family way back . A king ! You got any kings in your family ? " " No , " I said , no kings . " I quickened my pace . I did not want to talk about it . It was so difficult to be loyal to Maman and to Tony at the same time . " I 'm sorry , " I said solemnly . " But I can not be friends with you any more . " Tony bit his lip for a second and then smiled again pleasantly . " All right , " he said . " Someday , you know what we do ? We grow up and we do what we like . We be friends and go to Syria . We eat dates and olives and wild licorish . We catch silkworms . You ever see a silkworm ? We have dancing girls in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a king and I make you Prime Minister . Someday , huh ? " " Yes , " I agreed sadly . " Someday . " Tony was in trouble again a few weeks later . We had , in the school , a rotary fire escape . It was a great red silo attached to the  | side of the school building . Inside the silo was a metal , spiral slide . Trapped in the dark cavern , curved and mysterious as it was , Tony had kissed the girl behind him . She had gone crying to Miss Grey . The kiss could not have been anything of great passion . Tony had only found something that was more fun than dipping pigtails into the inkwell . Miss Grey , however , was exultant at this opportunity . Her spectacles bobbed with righteous wrath . " This , " she bellowed , " is what comes of reading La Vie parisienne ! " " Me , I ca n't read French , " Tony noted calmly . " You can look at the pictures , though ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Casino Burlesque . Bigger and better ! " " Tch ! " exclaimed Miss Grey . " A child your age at a burlesque show . If I had my way they would certainly not admit children . " " They do n't , " Tony assured her . " Only over fifteen . I am big for my age . " " You are vicious , too , and lewd . " Nobody knew what this meant , so there was no reaction . " I make a joke , that 's all , " Tony said helplessly . " A very indecent joke , " Miss Grey affirmed . " Taking advantage of an innocent little child . " " Me , too , I 'm an innocent child , " Tony observed . " No back talk ! " Miss Grey bellowed with rage . Tony spoke solemnly and deliberately : " Is something wrong in the Dominion of Canada to kiss a girl ? Is a law ? " Miss Grey shouted back : " I do not propose to discuss the subject . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to abandon your savage , passionate , lewd Syrian customs . " Tony smiled wistfully and looked Miss Grey straight in the eye .  | " Syrians , " he explained sadly , " are quiet like sheep for almost thirteen centuries . " Miss Grey , in the end , conceived of a most painful punishment for Tony . She forced Mr. Cone , the regular principal , to remove Tony from the Ogilvie Street Hockey Team . She forced Mr. Cone , I am certain , because the principal loved hockey . It was he who had made it possible for us to flood the schoolyard and make a rink . It was he who had paid , with his own money , for our red-white-and-black jerseys like those of the world-champion Ottawa Senators . Most of all , it was he who had pleaded for our admission , ragged as we were , into the City Public School League . For this we honored him . A few days later Tony , his grin faded , watched the hockey practice with moist , wistful eyes . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do something about it . I had never seen Tony forlorn before , and it seemed to me basically wrong for anyone with so much life in him to be made so empty . In the end , too , it was perhaps I who was to blame . I should not have corrupted him with La Vie parisienne . For the French it was all right . They understood these matters . For the Syrians . . . perhaps , as Maman said , they had too much hot blood . After supper that night I spoke to my mother . " You know , Maman , at the church sociable where there is singing and recitations for all the children  --  the one where I will recite It 's Only an Old Piece of Bunting ' ? and before that , the big banquet ? Well , is it not that we could invite Tony ? Perhaps we will make him a quiet Christian . Maybe the Lord will wish us to do this , no ? " My mother looked at me , puzzled , Papa grinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She shifted uneasily in her chair and looked up on one wall and the sign : CHRIST IS THE  | UNSEEN GUEST IN THIS HOUSE , and then at the other wall and sign : LOVE THY NEIGHBOR AS THYSELF . She swallowed hard and said : " Well , if you can persuade him to attend Sunday school for at least four consecutive Sundays before the sociable , I shall see what can be done . " " You are like the queen of the Ladies ' Aid , " I reminded her . You can make a law . " " We shall see , " Maman replied hastily . " Ah ! " said my father jovially , " how the angels must now be rejoicing in heaven ! " I told Tony the next time I saw him . He tightened his ragged necktie and went on cleaning brushes . " No , " he said thoughtfully . " I only make trouble every place . Even if I do nothing , the trouble comes . Maybe because I am different kind of people . Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad . To kiss a girl ai n't bad in Syria . My old man says everybody does it . Here it 's bad . To see a show with beautiful dancing girls is beautiful in Syria . In Canada it is bad until you are sixteen . Who can unmix me ? " He shrugged and held out both hands helplessly . Then he banged the brushes together and laughed . He had not laughed in a long time , and it was good to see him . " Say , " he said , " if Miss Grey ever see me in Sunday school she going to think God 's losing His mind . " The gloom of Tony 's refusal was made even darker by the result of our next hockey game . Our tattered , weak-ankled crowd was ingloriously swamped by Osgood Street , 12-1 . Without Tony , it was obvious , we were no good . With his wild , exultant , savage war cries and his crazy jokes , we used to be inspired . We continued to lose by immense scores . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an old , tired horse . Miss Grey , on the other hand , was as happy as a lark . The final game of the season was scheduled with a British boarding school which had the best of coaching and the most expensive of equipments . The only reason Yarborough ever condescended to play against us was that Mr. Cone had been graduated brilliantly from there . The day before the game I begged Tony to go to Mr. Cone and announce his decision to go to Sunday school and become converted from the heathen if Mr. Cone would permit him to play against Yarborough . I saw that under those circumstances Mr. Cone would be able to pursuade Miss Grey , who could scarcely place herself in the position of refusing to aid in the conversion of a heathen . Tony said no . " In this manner , " I went on almost hopelessly , " we will also have the angels on our side . " Tony thought this was very funny . He laughed for a long time . " But suppose the angels ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not promise to see Mr. Cone . When we got to Rockcliffe in the big sleigh the next afternoon , we put on our skates and shook in our uniforms like outnumbered soldiers before a battle . The Yarborough team had sticks taped like professionals ' . They had expensive , tubular hockey skates and thick woolen jerseys , heavily padded . We had skates with flat blades , cotton sweaters , and warped sticks , untaped . A great tittering arose as we stumbled out onto the ice . We  | were funny to see , I know . We were worse , in fact , than usual , frightened as we were . We did not skate well . We bumped into each other and tripped over our own sticks in practice . Our shots were many times buried in the snowbanks . In our hearts we were as ragged as we were on the ice . My hopes were as low as they could go when , as a last resort , I called again , rather aimlessly , on the Lord . " Dear God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to help me convert the heathen to Your side , what is the use ? Maybe even the Devil would be of more help . " As if stung by my reproach , le bon Dieu rolled up His sleeves and effected a miracle . For it surely was miraculous to see Tony skating across the ice in his curious , wild , pigeontoed fashion , shouting savage war whoops and waving his stick furiously above his head like a tribal chieftain 's spear . " Oho ! Wa-hoooooo ! Eeee-yi ! " he yelled , throwing his arms around me . " I fix it all up . It was not me who begged , you understand . It was Mr. Cone . He said if I go to Sunday school I can play . I said : good . I said I go to Sunday school and be a Christian and when I grow up I become the Mayor and I make Mr. Cone Superintendent of Schools . Now we lick the pants off these roast beefs ! Remember , I got a king in the family ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army fought nobly under its ancient monarch , and it was Tony who won the game in the last period with a deft shot he took on a pass from me . Together , we had triumphed , and that was as we would have wished it . Tony went to Sunday school four Sundays after that . He appeared  | on the night of the sociable as slicked and shined as one of the choice apples from the window of his father 's fruit store . There was , I must admit , some uneasy and adverse comment when he announced his selection of a song to sing as part of the contribution all the youngsters were supposed to make in return for their ice cream , oranges , and candy . He strode out onto the stage , enwrapped in a white sheet of some sort , his head held fast in the folds of a white towel , looking more like Valentino than that gallant himself . His song , he said , was I 'm the Sheik of Araby , and , in spite of the hums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a charm and gusto that won all feminine hearts : ... At night when you 're asleep , Into your tent I 'll creep .. . In the end the women agreed that while The Sheik was not exactly the best choice for a Sunday-school festival , there was , on the other hand , nothing openly sinful about it , especially since the church organist had known how to accompany Tony . On the way home , after Tony 's triumph , I asked Maman how she liked it . " He is very handsome , no ? " I said eagerly . " Yes , " Maman agreed , flushing a bit , " very . In a wild , passionate way , that is . I imagine he 'll be quite a one with the ladies when he 's a bit older . " " He is already , " I laughed . Maman smiled and cleared her throat uneasily . " I suppose , " she said crisply ; then , after a moment 's thought , observed slowly and thoughtfully , " I do n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lend him any more copies of La Vie parisienne. "  | The Very Little Symphony Toward the end of my grammar-school career there began being introduced into theaters mechanical monsters known as " pipe organs " which swept orchestras almost out of existence and placed Papa for a while in the position of what he called , " a lonesome dove . " He had quit playing for vaudeville to play for a cinema theater , and the introduction of an organ left him without an orchestra to conduct  --  a bird without a sky in which to soar . He was , indeed , a lonesome dove , to whom , as the proverb says , even the sweetest cherries are bitter .  | A touch of gloom entered our usually madly alive household , a rare gloom , because ours was a life which ordinarily bounded , soared , and sang all through the day and most of the night . There were two reasons for seeing the world through the blue glass . One was , of course , the knowledge that my father was ill at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds slowly vanished . We had never thought of money in any way except to get rid of it as quickly as possible and with as much pleasure . Banks , Papa assured us , failed . Happiness did not . At least not the sweet , tasty , musical memory of it . Well , I did not then quite understand that progress is a twoedged sword , that where there are love and joy and music someone will eventually arrive with inventive genius and a missing soul and corrupt it with steel and electricity at a good profit . I did , however , understand Papa 's lonely inactivity . I determined to keep my small , sharp eyes open for a suitable outlet for his magnificent talents . " Why , " I inquired hopefully one day , " do you not go in vaudeville and play popular songs on the violin ? " Papa rocked his chair , sipped his steaming coffee and brandy , and replied : " When your head is made of butter , it is better not to be a baker . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that mean ? " " It means if you are a baker and your head is made of butter you will lose your head . " " Well , " I persisted , " what does that mean ? " Papa laughed . " Let me tell it this way : in some cases the doctor is more to be feared than the disease . If I were an acrobat and could play the violin with my legs . twisted around my neck it might be different . "  | At school , one day , I overheard the teachers speaking of how wonderful it would be if the school system had a symphony orchestra made up of students from the various schools . A number of the pupils here and there could find old instruments in the attic or borrow them or even , in the case of the more well-to-do , purchase them . Mr. Cone , who played the cello , agreed it would be an excellent idea if it could be worked . I mentioned the conversation casually to my father that evening . " Name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrowed eyes and a faint , sad smile , " in school already they teach you nearly everything badly . Now they wish to add music to the list of those subjects in which your interest will be permanently ruined . " " If the school is so bad , " I inquired with some logic , " why is it that I have to go ? " My father drummed nervously on some sheets of unfinished music . It is the law , " he offered . " Eh bien , " I countered , " Uncle Louis says the law is only for lawyers and virtuous women . " " Do n't speak to me of a man who sees angels and who drinks wine from a water cooler , " my father retorted . I knew then that Papa was truly upset . He dearly loved Uncle Louis and at any normal time he would have stoutly defended his brother 's right to drink wine from a water cooler . I dropped the matter here because I felt any further discussion would only serve to make Papa firmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month the Board of Education had decided to form a sort of chair music and to teach all who wished to play an instrument and to function in an orchestra . The Board reminded pupils that money they had placed in the penny bank  | weekly might be profitably used in purchasing instruments . A checkup , however , showed that a goodly number already had instruments in the family or could secure them . I dutifully relayed this latest development to Papa , who had become increasingly gloomy and was composing sad nocturnes in a minor key all day . My father grunted . " So ! Everyone is to make music and all are to play in a great symphony , eh ? When ? " " Mr. Cone says a good teacher can teach pupils to read music in about three weeks . " " Ah , to read it , yes . But to read it and play it at the same time ? that is wine from a different bottle . " I brushed aside his scoffings . " If they offer you the job , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will take , " Papa said with a sigh , " a conductor with a magic wand , not a baton , to lead such a group . " " You are the one , " I said , trying flattery . " I am a genius , but not a magician . I am not so sure I am even a genius . No . Not me . Name of a pig , no child can learn music truly between geography and freehand drawing , like a sandwich . " " They do not have to learn it truly . It is only to make them and their parents happy to see them on a stage . It is only so they are exposed to music and that they find in it excitement . This is the theory of Mr. Cone . " Maman had come into the room with a duster and was quietly flicking bits from the bureau . Papa looked at her in annoyance . " No , " he said to me . " No . " " Tell him , Maman , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at my father . " We are no longer rich , you know . "  | " When , " Papa asked sadly , " were we rich ? " " Up until recently we had enough , " Maman said , not unkindly , " which is to be rich . " Papa shrugged and picked up his music . Maman continued : " We are now close to nothing . We have spent freely . The many uncles and aunts and cousins have been fed well : frogs ' legs , trout , grapes , cr  --  pes Suzette , many kinds of wines , some very expensive .. . " So , " said Papa nervously and a little ashamed , " we will sell something . The piano ! Eh ? " No . No ! " I shouted . Not the piano . " Each roll of the pianola was to me a memory : Avalon , Stumbling , Tales from the Vienna Woods , My Wonderful One , By the Sea  --  Yvonne , Mignonette , Elsie .. . " The bed , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet wide and nine feet long . " My mother smiled gently at him and waved the duster under his nose . " The bed ? " she said solemnly . " The bed of ... " " Ah , well . . . " Papa blushed faintly , " . . . no , not that bed . On the honeymoon we slept in that bed and we bought it from the hotel to have forever . Yes , I remember . No , not the bed . " We ran through everything , and there was nothing that did not have a memory or a dream covering it , and so there was nothing we could sell . I returned to the subject of the schools . " They do not ask to play well , my schoolmates . They ask only to play , or only to look as if they play , so their parents will be proud . If they play badly , even , at least they play . And if they only make motions they are learning the correct motions and they are hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than anything in the world . Except to
