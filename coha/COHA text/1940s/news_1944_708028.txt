txt The 90,000 persons gathered hi Soldiers ' field last night for the 15th annual Chicago Music Festival , sponsored by THE Ciricaco TRIBUNE , proved that two and one-half years of war have not robbed them of their interest in the pleasant things of peace . Here were the pageantry , the music , the unpretentious entertainment , and the warm air of friendliness which have distinguished , all 14 preceding Festivals . The reaction of the audience was enthusiastic and instantaneous , just as it has always been . The throng gave evi. dence of that American determine . tion to keep a level head and to preserve the values of peace even in the midst of unprecedented turmoil . American Values Honored . Nor were people mere escapists . The war was remembered again and again during the evening and much of the pageantry was military . Yet the simple and the homey and the typically American held a high place of honor on the program . . Take the performance by the " Oklahoma ! " company , for instance . Here was something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly and Unpretentious as front porch visit . lag . The general tone was set wtten Announcer Phil Maxwell asked the audience to give the visitors a whoop of welcome as they were drawn into the field in hay racks . Everybody relaxed , the performers included , and what followed had an informality and an earthiness which added much to Its charm . Cast Is Applauded . Such gay and lilting tunes as " Oh , What a Beautiful Mornin ' " and " People Will Say We 're in Love " were sung by the people who present them nightly on the stage of the Erlanger theater . The audi . ence , which must have included many persons who have spent months trying to chase down a couple of good tickets to " Oklahoma ! " applauded enthusiastically . They laughed when a real surrey , complete with fringe , was pulled In during the singing of " The Surrey with the Fringe on Top , " The half hour condensation of " Oklahoma !

Another enormously successful feature was the huge military pageant in which 2,000 men and women and boys and girls  --  many of them relatives or friends or neigh. hors of the people in the stands ? maneuvered on the field under the great flood lights and came together for stunning massed band perfor. mances of " Marching Along To . gethcr " and " America . " Match Lighting The 15th festival was remarkable not only for the number and inter . est of the new features but also for the presence on the program of such time tested festival events as the performance of the " Hallelujah " chorus , and the spectacular match lighting ceremony . The evening began quietly , then gradually gathered momentum . First there were appearances by winners of the various choral and instrumental contests which had preceded the festival proper , There was charming exhibition of baton twirling by sumptuously clad youngsters who handled their sticks like jugglers and drew much delighted applause from the audience .

The composer was present as guest of honor . Express Power In Faith . The composition is based on poems and patriotic utterances and has for its underlying theme the faith In America 's destiny expressed by Walt Whitman in the great lines : " I will plant companionship thick as trees along nil the rivers of America , and along the shores of " I will make inseparable cities , with their arms about each other 's necks . " Then came the suspense filled finals of the Festival vocal contest . The two men and two women who had survived the Chicago and out of town preliminary contests laid their cases before three judges ?

" A nostalgic hint of the peaceful , proauctive eAlrope OE other clays was contained In a performance of Strauss ' " Artist 's Life " waltz by the Festival Symphony orchestra under Henry Weber 's direction . Under alien skies and amid physical surroundings which the composer never could have dreamed of , the waltz 's intoxicating melodies yet had carried their accustomed beauty . Adeline Contest Winners . With one of the sudden changes characteristic of these festival programs , interest shifted from the stage to the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arena came nine open cars , each containing a young woman named Adeline . These were the runners-up in the recent contest whose purpose was to find the sweetest sweet Adeline in Chicago area war plants . A tenth car carrying Jean Adeline Christensen , 8245 Ridgeland ay. , the winner , then drew up toward the stage while the Four Misfits quartet , composed of Chicago district members of the Society for the Preservation and Encourgement of Barber Shop Quartet Singing in America , Inc. , sang " Sweet Adeline " in her honor . Harry Armstrong , composer of this and some 300 other songs , was introduced and placed a wreath of flowers on Miss Christensen 's brow . Under Carl Craven 's direction , the whole audience joined in singing " Sweet Adeline . " Carter 's Voice Thrills Audience . One of the evening 's musical high points was the appearance of Chief Specialist John Carter . The tenor , who temporarily abandoned a promising concert , movie , and radio career to enter the navy , proved In his performance of " Una Furtiva Lagrima @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , haunting beauty which his ntimirera remember so vividly . Ills delivery was simple and moving . Two of America 's allies were hon. ored in performances of Elgar 's " Land of Hope and Glory " tfor England and Tschaikowski 's " March Slav %lifer Russia . Then came one of the surprises which the festival management always tries to introduce into these programs . The spotlight shifted to a pyramid of 12 pianos manned by 19 women . Above them , on a mast high stand , was Antoinette Rich , conductor of the Chicago All.Girl Piano Symphony orchestra . At her signal , the girls tinkled into n performance of excerpts from Gershwin 's " Rhapsody in Blue . " 1,000 Children Sing .

The singing of the children proved to be a prelude to other choral music , for the Festival Negro chorus , with Prof. P. Wesley Jones directing , proceeded to offer a song which was a favorite of several earlier festivals , the melancholy spirituals " Swing Low , Sweet Chariot . " The singing was round and lovely in tone and it took op an extraordinary eloquence from the wealth of inflection which went into its performance . The friendly , neighborly quality of the Chicago Music Festivals was established at the first one back in 1930 when the audience was asked to sing the old time favorite songs together . Also , people found that making music themselves held a pleasure different from and sometimes deeper than that of mere listening . Community singing became a Festival feature . Last night at the 15th Festival , Frank Bennett led the throng in " Let Me Call You Sweetheart . " As the tune welled up from thousands of throats , the singers swayed rhythmically in time to it . The eagerly awaited match lighting ceremony could now be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All lights were turned out . Then , at a signal from the announcer , everybody in the arena struck a match . The effect was breath-taking as the dark stands suddenly became a mass of tiny flames . There was a solemn moment as the war was remembered in a prayer for our fighting men , delivered by Howard Hoffman , The mood was continued in a performance by Bruce Foote , W-G-N baritone , of Malotte 's " The Lord 's Prayer . " ? 2,000 Sing ' Hallelujah . ' Never has a festival program passed without the " Hallelujah " chorus from Handers " Messiah . " Once more , as In so many previous years , Dr. Edgar Nelson led the huge festival chorus of 2,000 voices in what Is regarded as one of the most tremendous musical expressions of faith and adoration ever penned . The time had come for the great concluding pageant It began when an army band led by Sgt. Gerald Jensen and consisting of picked musicians from Fort Sheridan , Camp Des Plaines , and Camp Skokie , marched smartly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The songs of the infantry and the air corps followed . There followed the band of the Great Lakes Naval Training center , led by Chief Specialist Anthony Vendetti , playing " Anchors Aweigh. " 40 BANDS PLAY " AMERICA , " Then came nearly 40 other bands from schools and municipal organIzations . They massed in the center of the field with the army and navy bands , , and the audience had the stirring experience of hearing " America " played by 2,000 musicians . The tune took on an extraordinary majesty , which was increased by the participation of the audience . Suddenly the north end of the field erupted as the fireworks dispiny began . While bombs burst and ; tar shells streaked thru the sky , pictures in flame of Gen. , Adm . Nimitz , and Gen. Eisenhower appeared ' against the black background . An invasion operation , wit h landing craft , tanks and an airplane , was outlined in lire . There was a cheer as the Eiffel tower , complete with American flag , suddenly appeared at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute inspiration of the festival management and honored American soldiers who are apparently about to occupy Paris .
