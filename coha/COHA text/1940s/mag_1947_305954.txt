With the air of an unwilling valetudinarian , Michigan 's handsome , boot-jawed Governor Kim Sigler got up to speak before the Economics Club of Detroit . Everybody in the ballroom of the Book-Cadillac Hotel knew that he would be operated on the next day for an ailing gall bladder . <P> " I have no fears about this thing , " he began diffidently . " When your number is up-well , your number is up . So I am going to speak frankly to you . " Then well-dressed Governor Sigler ( he has 43 suits plus a morning coat ) kept his promise . <P> " The office of governor of Michigan , " he said , " is now the crummiest job in the U.S. " A man , he grumped , should be elected for four years instead of two . That way he would have time to develop a program instead of thinking about re-election a couple of months after he got in . <P> He thought he ought to be able to name his own cabinet , with the exception of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason for the people to elect an attorney general or a secretary of state than there is for them to get the itch . " He took a dim view of doing departmental business by commission , board or bureau . " After 14 years of Washington 's experience with government by bureaus , " said Republican Sigler , " we know it did n't work . Every time you set up a bureau , you get the business of government further away from the people . " <P> One of his complaints was almost wistful : " If I do n't get out of the hospital , for heaven 's sake see that the next governor of Michigan has a place in which to live . " The state has no governor 's mansion . Governor Sigler lives with his wife in a three-room suite in the Olds Hotel across the street from the Capitol in Lansing . He said it gives him " cloisteritis . " <P> At week 's end , Kim Sigler was recovering from his operation . It looked as if he would be suffering from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
