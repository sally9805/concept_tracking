txt The American Society of Cornposers , Authors and Publishers charged yesterday the initial infringement of its catalogue- by the broadcasters . It alleged that on the regular Wednesday night program of Fred Allen , comedian , the song entitled " Wintergreen for President , " with music by the late George Gershwin and lyrics by Ira Gershwin , had been used at the start and finish of the broadcast over the Columbia Broadcasting System . ASCAP attorneys were instructed to prepare a suit naming as defendants the program 's sponsor ( Texaco ) , its advertising agency , the Columbia System and all CBS affiliates carrying the Allen show . Under the Federal Copyright Law the defendants are liable to a fine of $250 for each station that carried the program . The program is ordinarily heard over eighty-seven stations , which would mean a maximum penalty of $21,750 if the ASCAP claim is sustained in court . CBS made the following statement : " There is absolutely no basis for such a suit . The tune mentioned was not ' Wintergreen for President , ' but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G. Paine , general manager of ASCAP , which since the expiration of its radio contract on New Year 's Eve has been operating recording machines to catch infringements , said that " Wintergreen for President " had previously been used as a theme on Mr. Allen 's program . " The society intends to defend vigorously its composers and authors from piracy and exploitation by the radio monopoly , " he added . " George Gershwin is dead and can- I not protest against this piracy , but I this society , which was formed by writers to guard against just this sort of abuse , will protect his estate . " " Wintergreen for President " is from " Of Thee I Sing , " the musical comedy that won the Pulitzer Prize in 1932 .

His commercial program on CBS is not involved . The networks explained their ruling by the fact that the bands , much of whose success comes through special arrangements , ordinarily prepared their own programs and might easily run afoul of the copyright law . Bands could avoid the problem by having Broadcast Music , Inc. , the subsidiary of the radio industry , clear their programs , it was , providing they did not later interpret any extra notes .

ASCAP said the decision would be appealed . As to the indifference of the general public to the controversy , shown in informal surveys , ASCAP was not surprised , according to Mr. Paine . He said he never had expected any outbursts from radio listeners , believing that with the passing of time the public would show its disapproval over the loss of the ASCAP catalogue by merely turning their radios off .
