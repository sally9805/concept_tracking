From El Salvador , whose Theosophist-Dictator Maximiliano Hernndez Martinez suppressed a bloody revolt a few weeks ago ( TIME , April 17 ) , came the first news of the aftermath , and of new trouble for the Dictator . <P> The Graveyard . One casualty of the revolt was U.S. popularity . While the fighting was still going on , Colonel Tito Calvo , a rebel leader , drove up to the U.S. Embassy in a tank . He asked for Ambassador Walter Thurston , pleaded the ancient right of asylum . Thurston correctly told him that the U.S. recognized no such right . After the Colonel was seized and shot , Salvadorians blamed the U.S. for his death . <P> Thurston saw Martinez the day after the revolt , told him that the United Nations would judge him by his moderation . The dreaded Dictator did not reply . A few days later , the mother and sister of an arrested rebel begged the Ambassador to save his life . Thurston refused ( with perfect correctness ) , adding that Martinez had assured him that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right now in the graveyard , men are being shot ! " <P> She was right . That day eleven were shot . One , a civilian named Victor Marin , had been tortured all night to make him tell the names of his associates . He did not break down . When taken out for execution , both arms were broken , one eye gouged out , one shoulder dislocated , one knee smashed , his hand a bloody pulp . Asked a priest : " Victor , are you afraid of death ? " " No , Father , " he replied , " it is my body which trembles , not my spirit . " <P> Ambassador Thurston seemed to have tried , so far as correctness allowed , to soften the Dictator 's vengeance . But during the days of terror which followed the revolt , all El Salvador was sheltering fugitives . Priests lent their robes . Protestant ministers helped . The embassies of Costa Rica , Peru , Guatemala , Spain ( and probably others ) granted sanctuary . President Jorge Ubico of Guatemala , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borders , gave them money to get to Mexico . But the U.S. Embassy closed its doors against them . <P> There were good diplomatic reasons . The U.S. had never signed the Montevideo Treaty of 1933 which recognized the right of asylum , long traditional in many Latin American countries , but now outmoded in most of the world . Salvadorians , chock-full of U.S. democratic propaganda , did not understand the refusal . They took it as one more example of U.S. support for dictators . <P> For the Dead . The revolt , largely military , failed because its officer leaders did not arm civilians . Now the civilians , aghast at the blood bath which followed , were taking . belated part . The country seethed with hatred for Martinez . Rich and poor all loathed and feared him . The people were on strike . They refused to buy Government lottery tickets , go to Government movie theaters . Druggists , doctors , lawyers , justices of the peace , hundreds of Government employes declined to work . Railroad workers struck . The schools , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . Priests supported the movement . A mass for the souls of the executed drew huge crowds , was stopped by police .
