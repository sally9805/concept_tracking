( See Cover ) <P> In its trance of anxiety before the campaigns of spring and summer , the whole world-both its camps-wondered last week where the war would be won . <P> Would it be won when fanatical young men leaped from machines of invasion onto the beaches of Britain ? <P> Would it be won on the open seas ? <P> Would it be won in the stratosphere and just under the overcast and skimming along over the hedges ? <P> Would it be won in the Balkans ? <P> Of all these quite credible possibilities , only one answer was moderately certain last week : the war would not be won in the Balkans , although it might be decided there . <P> The enemies-shadowboxing , feinting , faking as hard as they could-could not forget , as they stumbled closer every day to a Balkan struggle , this terrible danger : If the Balkans became a major theatre of fighting , the war might very easily be lost in the Balkans . <P> For Germany , a setback in the Balkans would be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II . It would be the turning point of the war . <P> For Britain , a decisive defeat at Salonika ( or anywhere else in the Balkans ) would be more than another Narvik or another Dunkirk . It would mean the destruction of Britain 's only existing victorious army ; the closing of Europe 's back door ; the focusing of the entire war upon the British Isles-where , in the last analysis , World War II must be decided . <P> For both sides , the risk was appalling . And yet last week all the signs , all the hints which broke the fetters of censorship , seemed to suggest that the risks might be hazarded . Without either side wanting it , the battle seemed on its way to jointure . <P> Power in Extremity . In Belgrade , key to the whole Balkan tangle for the moment , there was a strange gaiety last week . The most reliable index of Yugoslavia 's enthusiasm is the amount of glass that gets broken .

The crowds danced the wild Serbian kolo until they were exhausted . Even the mothers and fathers of young men who had just gone off to military stations joined in the shouting . <P> No one seemed to know exactly what the celebrations were about . Yugoslavia certainly had no reason to be explosively cheerful : Nazi pressure was putting its last exquisitely painful touches on the Yugoslav body politic . <P> Probably the celebrants were happy because they suddenly realized Yugoslavia 's fleeting power . For a giddy moment , Yugoslavia was the most powerful nation in Europe . For an hour , Yugoslavia was stopping Hitler . The Yugoslavs realized that until Hitler was sure of them , he preferred to undertake no new adventure in the Balkans .
