President Truman thought that he had only a little news for his press conference last week . Most of his week 's work had concerned the strike and price problems ( see below ) which he hoped could be solved before his scheduled visit with Winston Churchill* in Florida . But the conference made some headline news anyway . <P> A reporter had come primed with a question about the Inter-American defense treaty and Argentina .

Then , smiling , he asked the newsman to complete his question . Midsentence , the President interrupted again .

Byrnes . Next day Jimmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rift . Said he : " No man as Secretary of State could ever have more complete support from the President than I have had . " <P> More Bad News .

Winston Churchill listened glumly for an hour , then said : " Mr. President , why do n't you go home ? I ca n't stand this noise much longer , and we ca n't leave until you do . " Recalling the incident , Harry Truman related : " But I was enjoying the music . And we kept Churchill on the hot seat another hour . "
