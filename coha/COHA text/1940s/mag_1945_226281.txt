Typhoid in Germany , reported UNRRA , was at 30 times its normal level in September . Syphilis had a " three-to-nine-fold increase in most countries and a 20-fold increase in Germany . " Belgium was recovering from a polio epidemic . But the diseases that worry UNRRA most are 1 ) tuberculosis , which kills those weakened by exposure and starvation , 2 ) influenza , which has not yet hit in force ( though many Berliners had it last week ) , 3 ) the strangely virulent diphtheria which struck hundreds of thousands of central and northern Europeans in 1942 and 1943 ( TIME , June 4 ) and has not yet let up . <P> This form of diphtheria is just as apt to attack adults as children . Even those who have been inoculated are not safe . The disease now flourishes in The Netherlands ( 4,000 new cases in one month ) and Bohemia ( 1,700 cases in a month ) and has made a start in Japan ( over 3,000 cases in Tokyo this year ) . Inoculation is still the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army inoculates civilians . A few countries have managed to inoculate their schoolchildren , but grownups everywhere are taking their risky chances .
