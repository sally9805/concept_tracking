Scientists , who go after everything with a fine-tooth comb , are always taking the fun out of mythology . Now they are currying the Golden Fleece . According to Greek legend , the fleece first belonged to a ram provided by the god Hermes to help two children , Helle and Phryxus , dodge an untrustworthy stepmother . The ram took off through the air with the children on its back . Helle fell off and was drowned ( hence the Hellespont , now the Dardanelles ) , but Phryxus reached the eastern shore of the Black Sea . He ungratefully sacrificed the ram to Zeus and gave its fleece to the King of Colchis , who put it in a sacred grove guarded by a dragon . <P> Jason , a relative of Phryxus , decided to get the fleece back . He outfitted a ship , the Argo , and manned it with big-muscled demigods , including Hercules . After some thrilling adventures with shipwrecks , sorcery , brazen bulls and aggressively amorous women , the Argonauts snatched the fleece and brought it home to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been good enough for millions of people. * But in the current issue of American Scientist , Dr. Arthur F. Taggart belittles it to pieces . The Golden Fleece , Dr. Taggart explains , was probably nothing but a detail of Heroic Age mining technique . The early Greeks lined their gold-washing sluices with sheepskins . The gold dust stuck to the natural grease in the wool . The same principle ( the selective attraction of oily substances for certain mineral particles ) is widely used today in the flotation process of concentrating metallic ores . Jason , then , according to Dr. Taggart , was perhaps no better than a sneak thief loitering around a primitive refinery . <P> <P> * According to Hercules , My Shipmate , by Robert Graves , the Golden Fleece was a bone of contention in divine power politics . Helle and Phryxus , tools of the " old religion " faction , stole it to spite Zeus , and Phryxus took it to Colchis . Jason , who was pro-Zeus , won it back .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
