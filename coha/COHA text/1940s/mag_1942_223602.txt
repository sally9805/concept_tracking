Whites in Salisbury , N.C. ( pop . 4,000 Negroes , 14,000 whites ) had not wanted Eleanor Roosevelt to come there to address a convention of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church of America . But last week Eleanor came just the same - her face aglow , her thoughts confused , her intentions motherly . <P> Legion leaders , churchmen , other Salisbury bigwigs had tried to find some way to keep Eleanor Roosevelt away . The big July 4 parade was a still-troubling memory in the town . Negro Boy Scouts had wanted to march alongside white Boy Scouts , Negro Legionnaires alongside white Legionnaires . But the parade chairman had told them : " You must forget that you live below the Mason-Dixon line , and while you are about it you can just forget the parade , too . " <P> Impromptu . But at the last minute a few white ladies changed their minds about being aloof . Led by Y.W.C.A. Secretary Mrs. Lula Carr , they met the First Lady at the train , arranged a luncheon , took her to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles Cannon explain how he treats 16,000 workers . Impressed , Mrs. Roosevelt nodded " My Day " approval in a way that would wound many a union man and flabbergast Columnist Westbrook Pegler : " In view of all this , which seems to meet high union standards , I was surprised to find that the mill was not unionized , but Mr. Cannon said they had always had good labor relations ever since his father had started the mill in ' 88 . " Charles Cannon gave her a big box of towels . <P> White and Black . That afternoon Negroes entertained the President 's wife . She had her picture taken with Negro leaders . She reviewed a parade of Negro soldiers from Camp Sutton , N.C. , led by white officers . In the evening Mrs. Roosevelt gave the address that the Negroes had been anxious to hear , that the whites had feared would put kerosene on Salisbury 's coals . Of 2,000 listeners , only 100 were white . Said Mrs. Roosevelt : <P> " We must have patience and we must try with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that man must have equal opportunity to get any job he is capable of filling . Minority groups in the United States have taken work bringing small incomes , and therefore set the whole economic level very low , for no other reason but that they belonged to the minority group . " <P> In the South colored folks began organizing themselves into Eleanor Clubs . One group of domestic servants banded together as " Daughters of Eleanor . "
