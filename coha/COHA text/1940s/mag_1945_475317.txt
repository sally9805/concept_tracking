WHEN the good day of peace comes and it does n't look at all imminent from where I sit ? the members of the armed forces of the United States are going to have a big problem to face . That problem is their homecoming with all the readjustments that it implies . It is too bad that coming home should be a problem . God knows they have done enough now for their country by any reasonable , or indeed unreasonable , standard , and their release from service to civilian life should be the joy and pleasure which many of them now anticipate . But the facts are against them , and so is the record of all history . Both facts and record point to the inevitable conclusion that it is a hard and a long job for the soldier to readjust himself to the ways of civilian life ; and that if he can not make that adjustment , he receives for his service a bonus of misery and loneliness and , sometimes , of despair . I shall attempt here to examine the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man who has served in the armed forces and is about to become again the civilian he formerly was . I am not attempting to solve the more serious problem of the neurotic or the psychotic soldier , but only to help the normal , war-weary veteran by forearming him with a knowledge of himself . That self has changed : if he can see the changes and recognize them , and if he can under-stand why they have occurred , half his battle has been won . The veteran who will have the hardest readjustment is he who , stumbling blindly against the differences he has not foreseen in himself and his world , resents them and fights against them . It is always a losing fight . Let us recognize then , at the outset , that most men do n't realize that they are forming habits until those habits are interrupted or brought forcibly to their attention . We have all , at one time or another , been brought up short by the observation of a friend ( or an enemy ) on our habits ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to do thus and so ? " The comment can refer to anything from starting every sentence with " Well . . . " to always going to sleep on the left side ? a habit sometimes discovered in odd ways . Most of us do n't recognize how strong is our habit of smoking until we find that we can get no more cigarettes . This applies equally to soldiers ( a word I shall employ throughout this article to cover all members of the armed forces ) . They have formed the habits of soldiery . How far are they aware of them ? How many , if they do realize them , do they want to hang on to in civilian life ? How many will they be forced to alter ? nn most frequent topic of conversation PTI .1 in armies is sex . The next most frequent topic is the dream of home ( though these are not mutually exclusive ) . That dream is usually phrased as , " Boy , what I 'm going to do when I get out of here ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life to going fishing , and it can include work or the chance to stay in bed for a long , long time ? and it has remarkable variations . But there are usually huge differences between the dream and the reality , and if those differences are allowed to become too huge , the reality is shocking . Many a soldier ? and this is particularly true of the combatant ? returns on leave or furlough to the home he has dreamed about so often , only to find that it is not as he had dreamed . It has changed . His parents , his wife , his girl friend ? they have all changed . Even the physical attributes of his homeland have changed . Only the rarely intelligent soldier , used to a certain healthy amount of introspection and analysis , realizes that it is really he who has changed ; that he is seeing this world of his through a totally new pair of lenses . Most soldiers are young when they go to war . They are not so young , or not the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The eyes they see with are not the same eyes they had when they went forth . This is a major and essential truth to face . When the soldier was young , he was a civilian ? a civilian boy . Boys often have exalted dreams . As they grow older and mature , the dream is modified , day by day , until finally it merges , after the passage of years , with the rather hard and stubborn realities of life . The civilian boy has time for this process of change . The soldier has not that time , nor will he have it . When he returns to civilian life he will not be given even the time he was allowed in which to become a soldier . He will jump slap from the dream of home into the reality of home . There is where the shock can arise . The wise soldier will think of this in advance . He will use the GI Bill of Rights to the fullest possible degree , to extend for himself that time of readjustment . He will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not once , but twice , as most men , including the most successful ones , have had to fail before they arrived at their ultimate success . MAGAZINE But even though he uses all the benefits government puts at his disposal , and uses them well , he will need above all to realize that only the passage of time will finally solve his problem of adjustment . He will , in short , need to give himself time to be patient , time to know his new self . He who does not know himself , does n't know much . H ERE are some of the differences he is going to have to realize if he is to know himself . Possessions that 's a big difference . When he was a civilian , he owned certain things . Whether he earned them or was given them is of little importance . The fate of those things was in his hands . His house , his machinery , his car , his radio , his gun and fishing rod , his books ? if he took good care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglected them , they deteriorated or broke down , and in order to repair or replace them , he would have to expend his own time and his own money . He got the rewards of his care , and he suffered the penalties of his carelessness . Now , as a soldier , he owns practically nothing . He owns only so much , as a rule , as he can carry about with him without personal inconvenience . Ninety-nine per cent of what he uses is given to him or , more exactly , loaned to him by the gov- ernment . It is GI Government Issue . The fate of these things concerns him , but quite differently from that of his civilian possessions . If he breaks , loses , wastes , or neglects these possessions of the government without valid reason or excuse , he is fined or punished or both . But if , on the contrary , any of them is broken or lost through no fault of his own , but by use or by enemy action , not only is that not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and efficient nation , is working night and day to see to it that he gets a new one , as good as possible and as soon as possible . This applies to everything from a B-29 to a pair of underdrawers . And if the object which we are discussing needs a repair , there are enormous supply dumps , kept in a high state of inventory , from which he can draw the necessary parts for his repair job . This fact breeds in soldiers a final contempt for possessions . It is not that they do not take care of what they have ; as a rule they do . But at any moment ? particularly in areas of combat if it is ex-pedient to abandon or jettison materiel , that is done without qualm ; and if it is not possible to replace materiel quickly through regular channels of application and supply , then what is needed is stolen without application . Anyone who has seen forward areas of war will vouch for the truth of this . On Guadalcanal , a detachment that had subsisted too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members took the clocks from unguarded planes ( flown into the area with difficulty ) to replace their broken wrist watches . I know it is true that soldiers do become attached , for instance , to a particular plane . But it is not the attachment of the civilian ; for the soldier knows that if that plane is destroyed and he survives he will find himself in another , and that at any moment , for reasons that must remain to him purely arbitrary , he may be transferred to another plane , another crew . Nothing similar could happen in civilian life . To a certain extent this same attitude toward possessions extends to money . Unless he is an officer ( who must pay for his clothes , though he is given an allowance for them ) , the soldier is clothed free . And if he wants to spend his money ? and many do ? on an extra , specially made uniform , that is not very important , for he will either spend it for that or lose it in a crap game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means to him , since it is , for him , only something he has as an extra , and without which he can subsist on about the same level as everyone else . And another odd thing about money and soldiers is that everyone knows exactly what everyone else is paid , and when , and ( usually ) just how long the money lasts . When the average soldier goes home , then , he is going back to a world that is totally without supply dumps or free replacements , where nothing is ever given away free ? except by the Salvation Army . E VEN food enters into this picture . When the soldier was a civilian , he had to earn his food . Even though he lived at home , he often had to help out there , and if he did n't , he went hungry . The world of civilians is a very hungry place . But now , as a soldier , no matter what happens , lie always eats . Not always regularly and , God be my witness , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mismanagement armies select their cooks . But most of the time most soldiers , even in combat , get food , though it may be only packaged rations . Men in combat tend to complain less about food than any others , because they have seen too many mobile kitchens ( or the jeeps or trucks that brought up the food ) destroyed by enemy action . Even so they complain . Why ? Because they have not had that which they have learned it was their immutable right to expect : three square meals a day . That is very different from civilian life . In the army , the chow line is an honorable , . if somewhat fatiguing , institution . In civilian life , it 's usually a disgrace . III V THENhe was a civilian , one of the things a man prized most was privacy . Privacy made men build their houses with doors that had locks on them , made them put shutters on the windows , blinds and shades and curtains in the windows . Privacy made men build high walls or plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a house were n't happy about it . They wanted enough money to get another room or two , to get the children , or the mother-in-law , out of their hair . When they went up to their room , their own room , no matter how small , they shut the door . Indeed , when they went to the bathroom , they shut the door . It is hardly necessary to labor the point of the difference in armies . Men sleep together , eat together , wash together . They share large barracks , or a pup tent , or a slit trench , or just a piece of ground . The only sort of privacy which they possess , and which is anywhere near inviolable , is in their mind . That has a door they can occasionally shut . But some of them , particularly those in combat , have discovered that even their thoughts have become , in a curious fashion , public property . Lives can depend on what another man is thinking . And therefore the soldier 's return to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be an odd sensation and not always a pleasant one . Privacy ? that habit of shutting oneself away from other human beings ? is as much a part of civilian life as his own exposed gregariousness is an inseparable and habitual part of the soldier 's existence . It is both active and passive . People shut themselves off from you at least as often as you shut yourself off from them . Such privacy may prove depressing , may breed a sense of loneliness in the soldier returned . Then there is the matter of team play . When the civilian does n't , or wo n't , play up on the team , he suffers only the small penalty of being thrown off the team . It is true that many men arc happier off a team than an it . But in armies , team play is geared to a scale quite different . When a man wo n't play on the army team , it can often be a matter of life or death , to himself and to others . It is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilian team play , which are taken so lightly , and have only a small personal and evanescent penalty . The cohesion of soldiers into united groups is the common result of the need for team play in time of war . There is no such cogency in civilian life . tic matter of team play is akin to an- other and greater one , one that essentially includes it . For the sake of brevity , I shall call it the hierarchical principle , and define it ( as far as armies are concerned ) as the strict gradation of rank in respect to responsibility . This hierarchical principle exists to its fullest extent in armies and navies in time of war . Soldiers who were old enough to hold down jobs in civilian life before they joined the services will recognize that this hierarchical principle exists to a limited degree in all businesses and industries . There are bosses , of differing rank , who can tell a man what to do and when to do it and even how to do it . Yet always it is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the civilian in a democracy to argue with , or object to , an order , and it is his further privilege , as a last resort , to refuse to do the job , to walk out . That is not true in armies . Now I am not talking of discipline . Discipline is the technique which makes the hierarchical principle function . Yet in itself it is the easiest of all the effects of army life to absorb afterwards . Discipline exists in armies in a form and with a strictness that can not , happily , be duplicated in civilian life ? except at the price of national freedom . But discipline as the usual part of the unusual military life leaves most men stronger than they were and even gives the weak a borrowed strength . What I am talking about is this : through the application of the hierarchical principle the individual is robbed , to a greater or lesser degree , of his initiative . That is because he is constantly subjected to a system wherein he is , ultimately , always dependent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . In order that any given command may be made effective , it is necessary for each man , as he receives his order , to act on it or to issue further orders to those who are below him . The man at the bottom has nothing to think about or do except that which he has been ordered to do , and he has absolutely nothing to do until he has received the order . Even for those who are higher up in the hierarchy , it is still essentially the same , for no matter how great their rank , their responsibility is forever qualified by the fact that it exists in execution only , and that ( with some few notable exceptions ) they are not responsible for the merits or demerits of the orders they receive . In civilian life , the man who is lazy is his own damned fool . He has decided to pamper himself , setting his own personal convenience and comfort in the place of first importance . Even though he is almost always engaged in the process of cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public opinion which can make him work . And some men are not at all affected by public opinion . Armies , however , are notable for the variety of means at their disposal by which they can persuade men to work . Any soldier will be glad to testify to this , and at some length . In combat , failure to work can bring immediate loss of life . But the reverse of the picture is interesting : there is extremely little scope for the soldier who wishes to work harder than he is ordered to do . I know that there arc ambitious and intelligent men in service who do what they have to do well and quickly and intelligently . And I know that in certain cases ( notable in air forces but commonly exceptional ) soldiers exercise their initiative to advantage . But generally speaking , it is a great mistake for the soldier , with the best will in the world , to exceed his orders . There is practically nothing he can do of that sort that will not get him into trouble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next order . This even obtains in combat . The platoon that goes after a further and unspecified objective may , and often does , leave exposed the flanks of those on its right and left . The unordered bombing of a particular target may turn out to have destroyed the one object that headquarters was most anxious to preserve . The soldier has had to learn to do what he has been ordered to do as well as he can ; to exercise his initiative within the limits of his orders ; to consolidate the job when it is accomplished ; but , when that is done , not to exercise his own personal initiative ? for it is likely to be the worst thing he could possibly do . It is the truth of this that breeds in energetic and ambitious men , turned soldiers , the capacity to gold-brick . War consists ten per cent of action and ninety per cent of waiting . Men in armies learn to do nothing with immense skill . Anyone who has ever visited the little , dreary islands of the Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further evidence . Staffs of armies beat their brains to think of things to order men to do in the long times of waiting . MI-1E1kt was a famous man who took ad-vantage of this hierarchical principle at both ends . He was T. E. Lawrence ? Lawrence of Arabia , who led the Revolt in the Desert in the last war . Lawrence was a complex and a highly gifted man . While he was fomenting the Arabian revolt , he was the opposite of what I have described , because he was , in effect , the top of his own self-created hierarchy . Much of the time he was completely out of touch with authority , and so his own initiative became ultimate , and found expression in some of the rather terrible and terrifying decisions he had to make . When the campaign in Arabia ended in that victory of General Allenby at Damascus which Lawrence had so greatly aided , Lawrence became the victim of his own singular conscience . He had promised the Arabs certain things -- without , I think , much assurance other than his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not fulfilled . And in the end , as a refuge from the cares and responsibilities of civilian life that his conscience made intolerable to him , Lawrence sought relief by enlisting as a private in the British army ? and that army then had a hierarchical principle more fully and strictly developed than any we have ever seen in this country . He did this , one gathers from his letters to his friends , in order that , as a private in the army , he might subject himself to the principle of having his life depend at last only on the orders of his superiors . The idea of the responsible action taken only because one is ordered to take action was to him , the man who had led almost single-handed the Revolt in the Desert , a featherbed of peacefulness . In our own army we have seen the famous General Mitchell disgraced , not because he was miles ahead on the use of air-power , but because he refused to follow the orders of those who were higher up in the hierarchy than he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Mitchell could not , or would not , accommodate himself to its limitations . When the average soldier returns to civilian life , he is going to miss this principle , which will be shockingly absent . Quite a few soldiers , no matter how they feel now , will continue in service because of it . They will miss , in civilian life , this elastic brace to which they have become so accustomed . Those who return ? the vast majority ? will find readjustment harder because of this . They are going to have to re-educate themselves into civilian initiative , which is to say initiative almost unlimited . T HE actual return home will present another problem . It is not a major one , for it can be quickly solved by understanding . When the soldier left home , in most cases home was all he knew of the world . When he returns , that will not be so . Now travel does n't broaden many people , nor does it usually persuade us that some other place is superior to our home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we judge that home and the people who inhabit it , and the use of this yardstick ( a use which is both unconscious and unavoidable ) will often make home and homefolks seem narrower and smaller than we have remembered them . If the soldier will realize this ; if he will remember , too , that for the most part his homefolks have no other yardstick than the single one he was limited to when he left them , and that it is quite impossible for him to lend them his yardstick , he will not find this problem difficult of solution . It is a matter of tolerance bred through understanding . Far more important than this is the effect of combat . Combat changes all men . The fact that you have killed , even with the best license in the world ; the fact that someone has deliberately set out to kill you ? these alter a man forever . Combat does not , in my experience , make most men hard-boiled but it does make them tougher in fiber and , oddly enough , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has , and that is to make the generality of men reluctant to discuss it except with those who have been through a similar experience . This occurs , I believe , because thus , and only thus , can they talk of it in shorthand , avoiding the words that they dislike to use . It will be well for the combatant soldier to realize two things , for they are immutable : First , he can not tell a man or a woman who has not been in combat what it is like ; it is an incommunicable experience , like childbirth . Second , he will remember that of all the things he has done this is the one that all men who have notbeen in combat will most want to hear of . If he realizes this in advance , it will save him from a deal of disappointment and friction . IV T HAvE said that combat is incommuni- cable . I will expand that by saying that the life of the soldier during a time of war is not a thing that can he learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will be written , to try to tell the civilian what war really is . He will never learn it until he has experienced it . It is of major importance for the soldier to realize this before he comes home to America . It will help him to realize that between him and the civilian who has never known war ? and such civilians will be the majority of our country 's population ? . there will be a huge gulf of unshared experience . That gulf can not be finally bridged by telling him about the civilian , or the civilian about him . It can be bridged only by recognizing its existence as a gulf that neither of them has to cross , a gulf which will , in time , disappear by a natural process of erosion , so long as neither of them digs it deeper by misunderstandings . How often in this war , in the combat areas , has not the soldier heard this : ' The home front does n't know there 's a war on " ? It would be far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what war is . " How can it know ? The people on the home front have never even been bombed . There is no glory for them . Life goes on , and it 's just a bit more difficult . The civilian is begged to put his money into war bonds , at interest , and he is called patriotic for doing so . Or for working overtime , at high wages . He gives some of his blood , he gives his leisure time to salvage , civilian defense , hospital work , canteens , whatever . At best he is cheerful and hard-working and uncomplaining ? and millions have been . What more can he do ? It will be well for the soldier to remember that the civilian has no hierarchy to depend on , that his orders carry no such force as do military orders . He is responsible primarily to himself for good citizenship , yet lie still has his family to feed and house and clothe , his house to heat , his rent and taxes to earn . If someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , report at Sick Call . " He has to find a doctor , and they are few and rushed now . He has to try to find a bed in a hospital , and that is very difficult . When the tools of his trade break down , even in legitimate use , he has no supply dump to fall back on . It will take him twice as long to repair them , and the repair will be half as satisfactory . His world , unlike the soldier 's , has not been simplified . For the soldier , the world is colored nearly in black and white . Everything possible has been done ( within the limits of human fallibility ) to reduce his life to the single aim of defeating the enemy . From the soldier are removed as many responsibilities and worries as possible , so as to free him , no matter how humble his task , for that one aim . The civilian 's world has been complicated , not simplified . For him , the enemy is not to be clearly seen simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred other enemies ? all the old enemies the soldier used to know and , unhappily , may learn to know again . They are called hunger , poverty , sickness , unfair labor practices , exploitation , selfishness of individuals and groups , political mischances like fascism and isolationism , flood and drought , or the terrible racial intolerances that Hitler has bred in us as well as in his own people . These torment the daily life of the civilian , and because of them ; because of the very nature of his life , he can not know what war is . Let the soldier remember this when he grows angry at the home front . His anger is natural , but he had better bury it in a foxhole when he leaves to come home : it will do no good . Let him bring back with him the need to reform , to make just , to make secure , and , above all , to make tolerant . These will help at home ? these will help him to his readjustment. itERE is another thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overestimation of gratitude . The civilian at home is grateful now to the soldier , and he is try-ing to express it , and will continue to do so for some time . But gratitude , while it may last for years as a conception , can not continually find expression . In fact , the continuation of grateful action finally becomes false and embarrassing where it does not also breed deterioration in the recipient . The soldier , then , can expect to be thanked and to be rewarded with something more tangible than words , more useful than decorations ; but he who returns from war with the conception that the country owes him a living and that all its debt to him will never be fully discharged in a lifetime is licked before he starts . Morally and spiritually ? and to a degree physically ? he has pauperized himself . Gratitude has its limits , and it is wise to realize this . Gratitude required is likely to turn to active dislike . o WREN he comes home ? with all the joy that is inherent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge that it is not going to be a simple job to readjust . It is going to be difficult . He is going to find freedom from authority , and the worries that haunt that freedom , hard to take . There is going to be no one to tell him what to do or what to wear , or when to do it or wear it . There is going to be none ( except for those who have done as he has done ) to whom he can communicate the fullness of his experience . Being human , he will try to tell his father , his mother , his wife , or his girl ? and he will fail , and , failing , will be depressed , turned in upon himself . There is going to be no Post Exchange for him to shop at , at cheap prices , and no supply dump . There are going to be no free meals three times a day . His wife , his children , other people ( perhaps even employees ) are going to come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest his own happiness and prosperity ? and theirs . He is going to find , suddenly , that he has no way of knowing surely who is above him or below him . The powerful often wear awful old clothes ; the weak are often dressed to kill , or to cover up their weakness . There will be no stripes , no bars , no insignia , no medals . The man of authority will be as hard to identify as is the Admiral when he goes in swimming . I have only one last word for the returning soldier . He was a civilian first . Then he was a civilian turned soldier . Now , in the course of time , he will be a civilian again . For God 's sake , then , let him be one ! Ile must not let anyone or any group persuade him to become a professional ex-soldier . These are the men who help to foment wars . Having learned to work well together in a good cause , they work too well together in a selfish one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all who are outside of it . We have a civilian for President and Commander in Chief , civilians as Secretaries of War and Navy . That is as it should be . When this war is over , we shall have to have a larger army and navy than we have ever kept before . Let thosewho wish to do so , then , rejoin these services : they are honorable professions . Let those who do not , become full time civilians . Grant told Lee at Appomattox to keep his horses , his men would need them for the spring plowing ; they would be civilians now , farmers , not soldiers . This was wisdom , and wisdom is worth emulating . Let me repeat at the end what I said at the outset : the problem is not easy , but the difficulty will be immensely reduced by knowledge of its existence and character . The wise soldier will con himself , note his difference from the man he was . That way he can readjust , secure in the knowledge that , having played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he can go on to an equal success as a civilian .
