txt Newspaper Boy Day To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I note that Oct. 4 has been designated as " Newspaper Boy Day " by the International Circulation Managers ' Association , and newspapers throughout the country have been urged " to publicize the many activities carried on for the benefit of their carrier salesmen . " Such a celebration seems somewhat ironical , for in several States the newspapers have just completed drives to break down all protection for newsboys : ( 1 ) The Indiana Child Labor Law was amended to exclude newsboy car- riers from all provisions ( minimum age , hours , night work and requirement of a physical examination ) ; ( 2 ) the passage of a street trades bill in Michigan , where there is no State regulation , seems to have been effectively blocked ; ( 3 ) a California bill nullifying the present permit system and permitting 10-year-old boys to work on the streets until 10 P. M. was passed but vetoed by the Governor ; ( 4 ) a Connecticut bill permitting boys tO work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The real celebration of " Newspaper Boy Day " should come when the newsboys throughout the country are protected under legal regulation .
