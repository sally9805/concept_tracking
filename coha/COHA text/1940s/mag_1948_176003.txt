Few music lovers ever have any trouble appreciating Artur Schnabel , the great pianist . But in London last week , even 66-year-old Pianist Schnabel himself was afraid that many were going to have trouble with Schnabel , the composer . His atonal First Symphony is so formidable that he thought London audiences and critics ought to get a warmup on it before its premiere . So he invited them to the final rehearsal . <P> In huge , unlit Albert Hall , while cleaners dusted , the critics and the curious watched as Sir Malcolm Sargent stopped the London Philharmonic Orchestra for the 18th time to cry " No , no ! ... Back to bar 175 again . " Finally , looking at his watch , he muttered , " Only two minutes more . My God , I must have this again . " Composer Schnabel , bent over his score , nodded his huge , bristly head with sympathy . Two years ago , the Minneapolis Symphony had taken 25 rehearsals before it dared to give Schnabel 's treacherous piece its first U.S. hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but only as a concession to form . Said he : " I hate bars . . . they are like policemen 's batons that strike down horribly , horribly . We must do away with them . " He likes his melodies to " flow with no barriers , like the sea . " He had composed his symphony ten years ago in the Swiss mountains , and likes to think of it as " glacial . " But , he warned , " Do not try to understand it . Just feel . " <P> The London audience felt all right-but pain , not pleasure . Said one listener after the concert : " It sounded like they were always tuning up . " And the critics gave the First a glacial reception . Said the Daily Herald : " Except at the dentist 's , I do n't remember a longer 35 minutes . " The Times , which did n't like it at all , summed up in deadpan fashion : " It contained some loud and soft , quick and slow sounds . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his last . "
