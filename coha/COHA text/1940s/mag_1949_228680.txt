Church membership in the U.S. , steadily growing since the latter half of the 19th Century , is still on the rise . This week the nondenominational Christian Herald , most authoritative voice on current U.S. Protestant church membership , released its figures for 1948* and gave churchmen statistical proof of the fact . <P> The overall gain in U.S. church membership last year was 2,190,164 , or 2.8% - more than equaling the estimated 1.7% population gain . This represents a total of 79,576,352 members , or 53.3% of the total population , the largest proportion of U.S. citizens ever yet recorded as church members . In the good old days of the old-time religion , the unchurched were far more numerous : in 1880 only 19.9% of the population were official church members ; by 1900 the figure was 34.7% , and by 1920 it had risen only to 39.8% . <P> Direct comparisons in the size of different church bodies is misleading because of the widely varying methods of compiling membership : some include all persons in the cultural , racial or nationality group served , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members . But the biggest percentage gain over 1947 was reported by the 1,872,049-member Disciples of Christ , with 9% . Next came the Northern Presbyterians , with 4.2% , and the Southern Presbyterians , with 3.9% . The Roman Catholics ranked seventh in percentage of increase , with 3.1% , while the Protestant Episcopal Church gained 3% . <P> <P> * Compiled from questionnaires sent out to 222 Protestant and 50 non-Protestant religious bodies in the U.S.
