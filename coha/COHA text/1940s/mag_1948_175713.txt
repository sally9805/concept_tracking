On television screens in nine cities last week , an announcer introduced something new in business procedure : " This is a report by Union Oil Co . It is the story of $171 million . . . where it came from and where it went . " <P> The report , all wrapped up in a film , took the viewers ( including many Union stockholders , who got letters well in advance ) across oilfields , up to the tops of derricks , through refinery gates and aboard the company 's seven-tanker fleet . Now &; again the camera veered back into a board room and focused on Union Oil Co. of California 's President Reese Hale Taylor . He gave an item-by-item explanation of the company 's annual financial report , the first ever televised . <P> Burly ( 6 ft. 4 in. , 240 lbs . ) Oilman Taylor was out to make two points . The first was an item of interest to stockholders : despite Union Oil 's whopping $18,910.860 profit , the highest in its history , the company still had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expansion , research and development . The other point was for U.S. industry generally : businessmen must find more effective means of telling the public of their problems , successes , failures . Taylor thought this important enough to broadcast the film to cities where Union Oil has few shareholders , no employees or customers . <P> One-Man Campaign . Taylor 's passion for telling people about the works of free enterprise has made him the West Coast 's prickliest burr in the pants of traditionalist businessmen . Los Angeles-born , he graduated from the University of California ( 1922 ) and went to work for an iron company which was later merged into Consolidated Steel Corp . In 1934 , when Taylor became Consolidated 's president , the company was in the red . He overhauled operations , cleaned out the deadwood and put Consolidated into the black . In 1938 , when Los Angeles Union Oil , oldest and second largest West Coast oil company , was in need of the same kind of overhauling , hard-driving Reese Taylor , then 38 , got the job . <P> Taylor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad repute . His discovery was backed up by a survey which showed that more than half the adult population thought the industry got together and fixed prices ; almost as many believed that the oil industry was a monopoly and should be nationalized . <P> He tried to get his competitors into a joint public-relations campaign to straighten out such misconceptions , but they refused . So five years ago he started his one-man campaign . In newspaper ads , he plugged the theme that " America 's Fifth Freedom Is Free Enterprise , " with cartoons and folksy parables discussing profits and wage rate-production relationships . Taylor tried the same trick with his annual reports , now thinks that in television he has found the best method yet . <P> New Kind of Oil . A lusty backslapper , who likes to give a party a night in his 8-room bungalow at Pasadena 's Huntington Hotel , Taylor has lately been barnstorming the U.S. to rouse businessmen on a new phase of labor relations . Says Taylor : " When a man spends about one-half of his waking hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and boring that he can hardly stand it ... where he has no real sense of contributing to the economic life of the community . . . he is very likely to become unhappy and dissatisfied .
