txt The hens at Deer Island House of Correction in Boston Harbor were , until recently , sitting pretty in de luxe quarters on the second and third floors of the Administration Building , but the fuel oil shortage has changed all that . The hens are out and 100 petty offenders are in . Various economies to save fuel were inaugurated at the House of Correction recently by Joseph P. Donahoe , Penal Institutions Commissioner for the City , among them the closing of the new prison building where the hundred persons convicted of minor offenses were housed . These prisoners , who work about the island during the day , now sleep on cots in the Administration Building under guard . Deer Island normally consumes 1,000,000 gallons of fuel oil a season . Mr. Donahoe has cut this to 500,000 gallons already and hopes to reduce it to 400,000 without de lay . In the meantime , plans are going forward to convert the great central heating plant of the institution to coal . Orders have been placed for the necessary grates , but complete conversion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Commissioner said . The only other building on the island now housing prisoners is the Hill Prison , where 408 offenders are confined . The normal population of Hill Prison , Mr. Donahoe said is 850 . He believes the war effort is responsible for the dropping off in criminals , and welcomes it also as an aid in his attempt to conserve fuel oil . Officers of the prison who formerly lived in a building which also housed a storehouse and a bakery , have been moved to what is known as the Old Master 's House and the Deputy Master 's House , permitting the former quarters to be closed off entirely .
