IN A MILITARY MANNER A Story SAMUEL ELKIN A LL winter long it was cold in the tent . The deep red glow from the small , rusted , potbellied stove in the center of the unvarnished wooden floor did not help , for the chimney usually clogged and the black smoke poured back down into the stove so that it was better to spend your time at the post exchange , knowing , however , that when the place closed you would only have to go back to your tent to sleep with both blankets , comforter , winter overcoat , and raincoat over your body and the heavy green winter hat the Army gave you to cover your head and ears . This way , if you lay still , the heat from your body soon made the bed nice and warm and you slept well until the whistle screeched at six in the morning and you had to get out of a warm bed into damp , freezing air to dress . When the winds shifted late in April and the weather did break you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold did not seem to be so cold anymore and you could breathe a little easier without coughing when you woke up in the morning . But the potbellied stove , though the chimney did not clog as often now still could not be regulated and it was this uneven change that put Jess Rivoni in the hospital . Influenza kept him in bed in the post hospital for two weeks and when he finally did get out the weather was clearing nicely . But Rivoni felt miserably low and that night he made for the post exchange and got drunk . Jess Rivoni got roaringly , drunkenly plastered on two dozen beers . " By God , Jess , that 's a lot of beers for a little guy to guzzle , " they said to him . Rivoni jumped up out of his chair . " Little guy ? Who 's a little guy ? " His eyes were streaky red . " Goddammit , I 'm one tough baby so do n't fool with me , see ? " " Shut up , you lousy spik , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the speaker . " I 'm an American ? " he roared back . " Do n't call me no damn spik , you sonofabitch . You looking for trouble we 'll give it to you , sonofabitch . " " You and what army ? " Rivoni clutched a beer bottle in his hand and lunged for the voice but the military police got to him first and dragged him outside . There they debated a moment whether to turn him in but Milt Chapman saw them and Chapman told the MP 's he would take Rivoni back to the tent . RIVONI was small and slim and dark . He was in his middle twenties . He had smooth oily skin , the color of a mulatto girl 's face faintly rouged . His eyes were black flashes that became murderously bloodshot by degrees when he was drinking . When sober he was swift and agile in all his movements . Everything he did he did swiftly and silently . Sometimes he appeared before you like a shadow . You turned around and there he was , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background of oily darkness . You jumped . " Scare you , hah ? " he said . " What the hell are you trying to do ? " He smiled slowly . " Just do n't say bad things about me when I 'm not around . " If you were not Milt Chapman you would say , " Nobody said anything about you , Jess . " " I do n't like people to say bad things about me . " " We would n't say bad things about you . " " I 'm liable to get mad and somebody 's liable to get hurt . " But if you were Milt Chapman you would tell Rivoni right off to go to hell . TN Txx weak overhead light Milt Chap-I man 's long , bony face seemed longer and bonier . He sat on a little wooden stool , leaning over slightly and stretching his hands out over the stove . He had been shoveling coal from the bin beside the latrine . " I 'm going to say plenty if he does n't snap out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does he think he is never doing any work around here ? " Freddie Clark and Pete Steidel  --  the three of them huddled around the stove trying to keep warm  --  said nothing . It was cold and damp and black outside . " The guy thinks everybody 's down on him , " Clark said . " He 's a smart little bluffer , " Chapman said . " He 's got all you guys fooled . " Steidel shook his head slowly . " I do n't know , Milt . I do n't like his looks . " " Neither do I , " Chapman said . " But he 's not bluffing me . " He leaned over and shook the grate a few times . " Tough guy , " he said contemptuously . Inside , the tent was a quickly thrown together affair . Unadorned and simple . Four cots stood against the walls , two on each side of the tent . Beside the head of each cot was a green Army footlocker . The wooden walls went up about halfway from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which ran horizontally to the wall . Clothes hung over each cot from nails which were driven into the lowest beam . The part where the walls broke off into separate beams was completely covered with canvas which came to a point high in thecenter of the tent , so that from the outside the entire affair bore some resemblance to an Indian tepee . Freddie Clark stood up and lay down on his cot in the far right corner of the tent . " I do n't know how he ever came in with us anyway , " he said . " I think he 's got it in for you , Milt . " " That worries me . " " He did n't like you taking that bed away from him . " " That 's too bad . " " I 've never seen it , " Clark said . " But somebody told me he carries a knife . " " Say what the hell is the matter with you guys ? " Chapman said . " No kidding , Milt , " Steidel said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one night . If you ask me he carries a knife all right . He looks just like the type . " " Okay , I 'm worried . Okay ? " Chapman said . Pete Steidel fiddled around with the coal in the bucket . " You know what he said to me after you had that argument ? " Chapman made a quick motion across his throat . " Yeah ? Well you might think it 's funny . But he said he was going to get some beers in him and fix your wagon someday . All right . You ask Freddie . He was with me . " " Listen , " Chapman said , laughing . " That baby will need a lot more than beer in his belly before he can fix my wagon . " The door flew open suddenly and Jess Rivoni staggered into the tent , his face bloated , his eyes streaky red . He did not shut the door , nor even glance at the others . He struggled over to his cot , flopped heavily on it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . Then he stood still and looked down at Rivoni . Freddie Clark and Pete Steidel also stared at Rivoni . No one said a word . f AY day came on the last day of the month . Within fifteen minutes there was a dice game going in Sergeant Donahue 's tent . The fat redfaced sergeant had a table set up . He was the house man . The word spread quickly . It was whispered in a huge grapevine system down the line so that before the last man received his pay he knew where to go if he cared . Jess Rivoni stood outside the messhall and gazed thoughtfully into space . He pulled a cigarette from the pocket of his fiekljacket , lit it , and drew on it . Here 's where I double twenty bucks , he thought . Maybe triple it with a little hick . Someone passed by and said , " Big game going in Donahue 's tent . You getting in on it ? " " Maybe . " Rivoni patted the money in his pants pocket and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarette , glanced quickly around , saw no one , and flipped the butt away . Inside Donahue 's tent there were at least twenty soldiers grouped around a long table with raised sideboards . The fat twinkly-eyed Sergeant stood at one end of the table pushing a pair of dice forward to eager hands . There was little talking . Tense , sweaty faces glowed in the shaded overhead light . The place swam in cigarette smoke . Someone was rolling at the moment and the dice made a soft tumbling sound as they hopped over the green-clothed tabletop to bounce sharply off the wooden sideboards . Sergeant Donahue leaned forward over the table , scooped up the dice , handed them to the roller , and said : " Nine going for four . Nine going for four . " The roller paused momentarily . " I 'll take four , " he said , peeling off two one-dollar bills . " You got a bet , " Rivoni said , tossing four dollars on the table . The bet covered , the soldier tossed out the dice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached for the six dollars and , as someone moved away from the table , he squeezed in , The table was cleared of all bets and the next mart in line took up the dice . Two dollars were tossed on the table . " I got a buck ! I got a buck ! " Rivoni said . His black eyes sparkled and tiny pellets of sweat stood out on his forehead . Someone covered the other dollar and Rivoni said , " A buck he do n't . Anybody , a buck he do n't . Come on , who 's game for a buck ? " " I 'll take it . " Rivoni tossed the dollar on the table and it was covered by Milt Chapman . The roller tossed out the dice . Two sixes came up . " Crap , " Rivoni said , a big smile on his lips as he pulled two dollars from the center of the table and two from his sidebet . He caught Chapman 's eye . He lit another cigarette , very nonchalantly . Money was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get his point . When the first roll brought up an eight he threw down four dollars on the table . " How about it , Chapman ? Four he do n't . " Without a word or a glance Milt Chapman dropped four dollars on the table . Eight was the point and the shooter rolled out a seven . Jess Rivoni laughed as he swept the money up in his right hand . " You playing the wrong man , Chapman . The wrong man , " he said . I 'm going to break this game , he thought . I 'm hot . I can feel it . It was his turn to shoot . He counted twenty-eight dollars in his hand . He dropped the usual two dollars in the pot to start and Sergeant Donahue gave him the dice . Rivoni picked them up in his right hand , stroked them tenderly as one would a kitten , huffed on them , shook them close to his ear , and then rolled out . " Seven ! " he shouted . " Wow ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's four bucks in there now ! Do n't hold me back ! Do n't hold me back ! " The money was covered and he rolled out the dice again . " Santa Maria ! Eleven they say ! Nice be-yootiful elevens ! Christ Almighty ! " Jess Rivoni pulled three dollars , leaving five on the table . " Come on , Chapman , " he urged . " Put your dough down . Put it down , boy . I 'm hot . Plen-ty hot . Put-it-down . " " I got three , " Chapman said . " Is that all , Chapman ? Cold feet , hah ? " Someone else covered the other two dollars and Rivoni began to click the dice . " Come on , baby , " he purred . " Show Chapman what a seven looks like . Just a nice little seven . That 's all . A nnnnniccce ? " The dice swept out of his hand and smacked up against the sideboard at the far end of the table . " Seven ! " he shouted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus , I do n't even get a chance to make a sidebet . Ai n't it terrible , hah ? " Someone cursed . Seven soldiers dropped away from the table . Sergeant Donahue was smiling . " Here 's the boy . Here he is . Gim me a quarter , Rivoni . " " Sure , sure , Sergeant . Why not , eh , Chapman ? " Milt Chapman counted the thirty dollars in his hand . He hesitated only a moment . Then he covered Rivoni 's ten on the table with a ten-dollar bill . r Tx 's gesture the others around the table held their bets . They saw that this was now a personal affair . Jess Rivoni 's eyebrows went up with surprise . " Is that ten ? " he said . " By God , Chapman , you getting kind of reckless , ai n't you ? " Smiling , Rivoni began to shake the dice . He rolled out but Chapman broke the roll , automatically calling for a new pair of dice . Sergeant Donahue threw four sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take your choice , Chapman . " Milt Chapman chose a pair of dice and gave them to Donahue , who cleared the other dice off the table and threw the pair Chapman had given him to Rivoni . Jess Rivoni picked up the dice and began to shake them . He was still laughing . " It ai n't the dice , boy , " he said . " It 's me . I 'm the guy . What 's a couple of dice ? " Rivoni flung the dice against the sideboard Chapman was standing against and a quick buzz swept around the tent . Milt Chapman jerked his head slightly . Rivoni laughed loudly . Goddam , goddam , he thought . I 'm going to break this guy . " Okay , Chapman , " he said . " Shoot the twenty . " He glanced quickly at the soldiers lined around the table . Their astonished faces pleased him . He smiled at Sergeant Donahue , winked back as Donahue winked at him . Milt Chapman , almost carelessly , tossed twenty dollars on the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was very quiet in the place . Everyone seemed to be holding his breath . Rivoni flung out the dice . They bounced across the table and two threes came up . Rivoni had started to pick up the money , but now the smile slowly slid away from his lips . He picked up the dice and rolled them out again . Eight . With a quick , jerky motion Jess Rivoni wiped the sweat from his brow . Milt Chapman appeared very calm . Rivoni 's color was beginning to change under the overhead light . What the hell , he thought . I 'm still good . I can feel it . He picked up the dice and shook them . He would not look at Chapman . All it takes is a little six . That 's all . Come on , baby . A nice little six . The dice swept across the table . Four . Bastard . Rivoni clutched the dice , smacked them down on the table , picked them up . " Come on , you little bastards , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six " He tossed the dice out hard , bending over the table as he did it so that his hands came to rest flat on the tabletop . The dice galloped over the billiardcloth , rebounded , and as they stopped rolling Rivoni brought both palms down on the table with a crash and the money and dice bounced up . He straightened swiftly and let out a roaring stream of curse words . Four and three . Seven . Rivoni watched Milt Chapman reach for the forty dollars . Milt Chapman was very slow about it . " It 's your roll , " Rivoni said . He tried hard to keep the tremor out of his voice but when he saw Chapman begin to count his money he exploded . " Goddammit , it 's your roll ! You know how much goddam money you got there ! " Milt Chapman looked up . He was smiling . " Rivoni , " he said as though he had just seen him for the first time . " You still here ? " Rivoni flung a ten-dollar bill on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly . And very slowly he began to shake the dice and very slowly he tossed them out with an easy flowing motion . An eight came up . " Ten more says I make the eight , " Chapman said . Rivoni dropped ten more dollars on the table . Milt Chapman began to shake the dice . He did not take his eyes away from Rivoni . Even when he rolled out , his eyes were watching Rivoni 's face . He saw Rivoni tighten up as the dice stopped rolling . He watched the anger working over Rivoni 's face . He heard Rivoni roar out , cursing , and saw him slam nine dollars on the table . Chapman drew all but nine dollars from the pot and before he even threw out the dice he knew it was going to be a seven and he was already reaching for the money . Everybody expected another burst from Rivoni , but nothing came . Then Jess Rivoni and Milt Chapman stood staring at each other across the table . Without a word passing between them Rivoni turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door of his tent behind him . His anger was so great vi/ and so much inside him that he was biting into his lower lip and it was bleeding and he did not realize it . He lay down on his bed , then got up and strode around the room . He began to curse . He felt something dribbling down his chin . He wiped it away with his hand , saw that it was blood , and cursed some more . He dropped down on his footlocker and lit a cigarette . He had to do something . That 's all there was to it . He had to get even with that dirty lousy bastard . He tossed the cigarette at the stove . He got up and turned to Chapman 's corner of the tent . His eyes fell on Chapman 's footlocker . He stood very still and stared at the footlocker . He stood very still a long time staring at Milt Chapman 's footlocker , then went over to it , knelt down , and slipped the opened lock off and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nose . He got up , went over to his locker , unlocked his lock , and held both locks in his hands . The two locks looked exactly alike . Quickly now he slipped Chapman 's lock on his locker , leaving the lock open . Then he went back to Chapman 's locker and put his own lock in place , leaving it open too . This time when he stood up there was a smile on his lips . lle glanced slowly around the tent . He moved his head up and down . It was a natural . One thing more and the setup would he complete . He went over to the gray coalbucket that stood behind the potbellied stove . There was some coal in it and bits of wood . Moments later he was back in the tent , satisfied that no one had seen him . He placed the empty coalbucket behind the potbellied stove . He looked around the tent again to see that everything was in order . When he felt sure that it was , he lay down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came into the tent and saw Rivoni lying on the cot , sleeping . Chapman knelt beside his footlocker and opened it . It did not bother him that the lock was open . He left it that way many times . He took a bulging wallet from the left rear pocket of his trousers and placed it in the right top chamber of the locker . He began to search through the locker but could not find what he was looking for . Then he picked up the wallet again , opened it , and withdrew all the bills from the moneyfold . He counted slowly and carefully . When he finished counting he glanced at Rivoni . He kept looking at Rivoni , watching his eyes . After a while he counted of three dollars , picked up the top half of the locker , and placed the rest of the money under a pile of clothes . He stood up suddenly . He moved lightly over to Rivoni 's bun. : He bent over and listened breathlessly to Rivoni 's ? breathing . He straightened up . rubbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and returned to it . He put the top half back in place . Then he closed the locker , snapped the lock , and went out of the tent , shutting the door slowly behind him . J ESS Rtvom lay on his cot a long time after Chapman went out . It began to get dark inside the tent . The camp became quiet with the dusk . Faint sounds drifted from other tents . A few radios were on . Someone laughed and the sound seemed to drift over the whole street outside . The cold , brought on by the night , seeped into the tent but Rivoni did not seem to feel it . His shape became blurry and soon he was lost in darkness . When the door of the tent swung open and Pete Steidel and Freddie Clark came in and switched on the light they were surprised to see Rivoni sitting up on the edge of the cot . Jess Rivoni stood up , stretched himself , put on his field hat , and went out . " Well , what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pete Steidel laughed . " He lost all his dough in a crap game . " " Serves him right . " Clark shivered . " Damn , it 's cold in here , " he said . J ESS RIVONI shut the door behind him and suddenly became a swift and agile shadow . The darkness of his skin and uniform blended perfectly with the night . In a moment he had gone a hundred paces without a sound and he came to the mess-hall behind the tents . There he sat down on the rear steps which led into the kitchen . No one could see him now but he had a clear view of his tent . He reached for a cigarette , changed his mind . One , two , three , he thought . One , two , three . Crazy phrase . He laughed softly . It would take them about three minutes at least to get coal and paper and wood . He had it all figured out . Right down to the last detail . Even to what they would say to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Nothing . Come on , now . Do n't act dumb , Rivoni . You were in the tent , you know . I was sleeping , you know . You could not have been sleeping . All right . So if I was n't sleeping then how did I get the lock open without breaking it ? Let me see your key . Certainly . They would try his key and , of course , it would n't fit because by that time Chap-man 's lock would be back on his locker . He laughed again , softly , shaking his head , feeling well pleased . Smart ? God-dam , it was perfect . He shivered . He was a little nervous . He wished he had something in him . A couple of drinks . He sighed . They should be coming out . It was cold . His teeth began to chatter . Why did n't they come out ? A shaft of light from an opened door brought Rivoni to his feet . He tightened up all over . His heart beat hard in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut the door , and before they had turned into the narrow alleyway between the tents he was fifty paces away from the messhall without having made a sound . MESS Rtvom pushed open the door of his tent . The locker key was already in his hand . He shut the door . One , two , three , he thought . One , two , three , one two three one twothreconetwothree onetwothreeonetwothree the damn crazy thing . Someone yelled . The sound startled him for a moment . He fell down before Chapman 's locker . He pulled off the lock and pushed the top open . He lifted the top half of the locker and began searching through the clothes . He became a little panicky when he could not find the money . The blood pounded in his temples . Someone else yelled and he snapped up , cursing , bending over again quickly , angrily . His breath was coming in quick gasps . His hand touched something round and firm and hard . He pulled it out . He was smiling . He reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in place when the door swept open and something like the stab of a knife pierced Rivoni 's chest as he looked up into Milt Chapman 's astonished face . In that instant a crazy mad panic gripped Rivoni . He dropped the money and streaked for the electric lightcord , pulled it , plunging the tent into darkness . A roar came from the doorway and it almost made Jess Rivoni scream . He ran forward and rammed into Milt Chapman , knocking him out into the street . Now outside he ran through the narrow alleyway between the tents . Now there was yelling and shouting and there was this terrible pounding and the screaming of his heart and onetwothreeonetwothree faster and faster and faster . Doors were opening and lights fell on him as he ran one way and then the other . He bumped into something and fell and was up again , running . And everywhere there were faces and lights and hands reaching out for him . And two arms came from nowhere and he swerved out of the way and crashed into a wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roughly to his feet and he struggled and screamed , " I did n't do anything ! Lemme go ! Lemme go ! " " What the hell 's the matter ? " " I do n't know . I think he 's gone crazy . " " Take him into the latrine . Somebody better call the hospital . " F OUR soldiers , followed by a dozen snore , pulled the struggling , screaming Rivoni into the latrine . They propped him up against a washbasin because Rivoni could hardly stand , he was shaking so much . His face was white and sickly . His black eyes were bright with fear and his nostrils were wide and much whiter than the rest of his face . . " Rivoni ! What 's the matter , Rivoni ? " This was Pete Steidel . But Rivoni did not recognize voices now . He was screaming , " I did n't do anything ! I did n't do anything ! Lem-me go ! Lemme go ! " Someone said , " Chapman caught him stealing money from his locker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the screams died in his throat . Those watching his face spun around and something in the way Milt Chapman stood made them move aside . Suddenly it was so still in the latrine you could hear Chapman 's rubber heels moving across the stone floor . You could hear Rivoni 's heavy breathing . You could hear his body move back as Chapman brought the palm of his right hand flush against Rivoni 's cheek . The sound of impact was like two boards being smacked together . No one saw what followed . Not even Milt Chapman , who suddenly stepped back , holding his upper forearm where the shirt was slit and blood was already flowing . Rivoni was crouched over , his eyes bloodshot and dancing , a knife in his right hand . I 'LL kill you , " Rivoni said . " /11 kill you , sonofabitch . " There was not another sound in the latrine . Yet the very silence seemed deafening . Rivoni backed up , crouching , watching , his eyes crazy . Chapman followed , slowly , carefully , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rivoni said . " I 'll kill you , sonofabitch . " Rivoni backed up into one corner of the latrine . He kept motioning with the knife . Chapman followed him into the corner . The others followed Chapman . Rivoni was in a corner now over by the toilet bowls . He swept the knife through the air as Chapman moved closer , carefully , slowly ; and suddenly Chapman kicked . His foot caught Rivoni 's knife-hand and sent the knife flying across the latrine . Rivoni let out a scream and lunged into Chapman but Chapman clutched Rivoni by his shirt and slammed him against the wall . Rivoni rebounded and it seemed that Chapman 's fist went right through Rivoni 's face as it landed . Rivoni slammed back into the wall and dropped to the stone floor . The others did not move . They did not speak . They watched . Chapman picked Rivoni off the floor , propped him against the wall , and brought his right fist up , then his left , then his right again , holding Rivoni up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each blow Rivoni 's head smacked against the wall . There were no other sounds in the latrine except the sounds of fighting and of a head crashing against the wall . There were no other movements . Chapman took his time with each blow . At last Rivoni plunged out of Chap-man 's grasp , went stumbling across the floor from the force of a blow , tripped , fell down , crashed into a toilet bowl , and came to rest with his bloody , battered face against the rim of the toilet bowl and one arm inside the bowl . No one laughed . No one smiled . I HEY propped Rivoni up in a chair in the orderly room . He could not sit without someone holding him . His battered chin lay on his chest , his arms between his knees . He felt no pain , just a dullness all over . There was a steady ringing in his ears . He could hear voices talking , but he did not know what they were saying . The sounds seemed very far away . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel when he had to get up in the morning and how cold it had been in the tents during the winter and how when he had to get out of bed to go tothe latrine it was so cold he just opened the door and did it outside Now he heard a brisk voice come into the room and say something . There were other voices , slower ones , then the brisk voice again , and then someone shoving him back and his face turned to the light . He could not see but the light hurt his eyes . The hand went away from him and he dropped his head down on his chest again . Now the brisk voice again . " The lowest bastard in the army is a crook , " the first sergeant said . " Do n't worry , Chapman . I 'll fix up the report . Do n't worry about it . When he 's through with the hospital he 'll be a case for the guardhouse . And I hope they give it to him good . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his chest and his arms hung between his knees and now that crazy thing was going around in his head , that one , two , three , one , two , three .
