Why had the Allies chosen to strike now in Italy ? To capture Rome ? To wipe out the Cassino disgrace ? It was much more than that . Said General Sir Harold R. L. G. Alexander in his order of the day : " We are going to destroy the German armies in Italy . " There were undoubtedly other factors which General Alexander did not mention . <P> So long as Nazi Field Marshal Albert Kesselring 's 20-odd divisions were tied up in Italy , the Nazis would have to divert supplies to them which might otherwise go to the invasion coast . Likewise , Kesselring must be prepared for amphibious landings in the north . ( Berlin radio fran tically forecast that Allied troops were poised in Corsica and Sardinia for such a purpose . ) In the Anzio sector , stiff Prussian Colonel General Eberhard von Mackensen planned to meet another Fifth Army attack on the Germans ' flank . <P> Favorable . The moment General Alexander chose for attacking was probably as favorable as he would ever have . Italy 's severest winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The Allies had complete naval supremacy , which enabled them to bring in the thousands of tons of supplies which any day 's battle requires . They had air supremacy too . Major General John ( " Uncle Joe " ) Cannon , tactical air commander in Italy , boasted that his planes had knocked out rail communication so completely that no through trains had moved from the Po Valley to the Gustav line since March 24 ; the Germans had to rely on truck transport , chiefly at night , over Highway No. 7 - the Via Appia-and Highway No. 6-Via Casilina . <P> Three days after the battle 's beginning , picked U.S. bombardiers blew a 4O-ft. hole in the Avisio rail viaduct on the Brenner Pass line . Presumably the 75 daily trainloads of supplies which the Nazis had been sending into Italy over this key route would be stopped , at least temporarily . <P> Unfavorable . Regardless of these advantages , General Alexander 's polyglot troops faced the stern necessity of climbing mountains over land mines , through entrenched machine-gun fire , delivered by crack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew upon the men who in the final analysis must win all wars : the infantry . <P> His best hope of destroying the German armies lay in forcing Hitler 's men to consume their accumulated stocks of supplies , their large store of ammunition . In the battle 's early stages Alexander could hardly hope to kill one entrenched German for each of his own men killed . His infantry men narrowed their lips and started climbing .
