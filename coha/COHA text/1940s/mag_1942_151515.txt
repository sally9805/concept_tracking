" Cities are living organisms ; they are born and . . . develop , disintegrate and die . . . . The cities of today . . . universally exhibit the same alarming symptoms . These endanger their very existence . " <P> The author of this diagnosis is Architect Jose Luis Sert ( nephew of famed Spanish muralist Jose Maria Sert ) , who speaks the view of the International Congresses for Modern Architecture ( C.I.A.M.* ) . To their title question , Can Our Cities Survive ? ( Harvard University Press ; $5 ) , Mr. Sert and his group answer : Not unless they are replanned ; considering the shape modern cities are in , the only moot point is whether they will die lingeringly of internal maladies or violently by bombing . <P> Says Planner Sert : " In its academic and traditional sense , city planning has become obsolete . In its place must be substituted urban biology . " <P> Functional city planning-based on a city 's dwelling , industrial , traffic and social needs-is an old idea , but Author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it : <P> Suburbs . Suburban living does not solve city overcrowding . As cities thrust out their suburban arms , overcrowding , smoke and destruction of the landscape move with them . <P> Decentralization is " a beautifully romantic ' back to nature ' idea ! " But Sert points to the ghost towns of the Depression as examples of what might happen to great cities if they became " the victims of a complete and unplanned decentralization . " <P> Slum Clearance , usually an unplanned , piecemeal job , results merely in replacing old buildings with shiny new ones on too-expensive , too-crowded land . <P> But Mr. Sert and his colleagues do not propose to leave the city to its apparently inevitable fate . Instead of dispersing the city or making it smaller , they would quicken its blood stream by means of express highways ; give it air to breathe by surrounding each business and industrial district with a green belt ; make it self-contained by providing facilities for recreation and fuller living within the city itself . <P> The key to their plan is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sert group propose to house the city 's people in skyscrapers , surrounded by wide open spaces , and by doing so to provide a single solution for a modern city 's two greatest dangers , congestion and bombing . <P> Of the two prevailing present types of city housing-tenements and single-family houses-both are vulnerable to bombing : tenements because they make an unmissable target ; small houses , because it is too costly to build strong shelters for them . The C.I.A.M. 's skyscraper houses would at once offer smaller horizontal areas as targets and provide impregnable , easily accessible shelters . <P> <P> *Congrs Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne.
