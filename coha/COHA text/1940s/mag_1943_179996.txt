Allied secret diplomacy last week made its second major decision in French North Africa . The results were as politically disturbing , as morally disheartening to the United Nations cause as the first decision nine months ago . Then the U.S. had used turncoat Admiral Jean Franois Darlan on the ground of expediency . Now the U.S. and Britain insisted that control over the French armed forces in North Africa must go to General Henri Honor Giraud and not to General Charles de Gaulle , on the ground that it would be militarily dangerous to risk a sudden reform in the French army . <P> The Allies let their wishes be known as the French Committee of Liberation met for a showdown over the issue of military control . Out of a three-hour session emerged a makeshift compromise . General Giraud remained as Commander in Chief of the North and West African troops ( 300,000 ) , with his own army , navy and air chiefs of staff . General de Gaulle remained as Commander in Chief of forces ( 90,000 ) elsewhere in the Empire , also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their staffs would operate as a committee to supervise military reform . <P> Organized Disunity . From Algiers TIME Correspondent Jack Belden cabled this estimate of the compromise : <P> " Clearly the Committee of Liberation is not yet a de facto , sovereign , unified power . Within the French Empire there now exist two armies responsible to two different commanders who are not responsible to one war minister . In terms of the hopes of a few days ago , this is a turning back of the French political clock . And hollow sound the recent words of De Gaulle and Giraud : ' Frenchmen , the unity you have been waiting for has been achieved . ' <P> " The compromise has eased tension , but it has not meant victory for either party . De Gaulle , who came here with the intention of creating a strong , central , sovereign power , now finds that the power is split , that his plans for broad , sweeping reforms are reduced . For General Giraud , also , the compromise can not be satisfying . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chief by virtue of Allied intervention . <P> " The politically conscious Frenchman in the street is bitter as he sees his country 's unity and sovereignty once more broken in pieces . One Frenchman summed up his feelings thus : ' The British landed here first as Americans . The next time the Americans will have to come as British . ' " <P> Organized Defamation . " The attempt to cover political acts with a cloak of military necessity in this case will just not go down . Yet certain backstage French interests are trying , under this cloak , to foster their own interests and sabotage the De Gaulle-Giraud union . There is growing evidence that certain interests , fearful of public opinion in favor of General de Gaulle , have deliberately set out to guide , control and change that public opinion as the chief stumbling block in the consummation of their aims . <P> " Viewing this struggle , it is not surprising that French unity has not been achieved . North Africa has not been pregnant with a new France , but has only had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contending cliques at the top , is not strained through the French masses , who are too far away to make themselves strongly felt .
