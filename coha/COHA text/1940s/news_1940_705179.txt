txt Record fourth quarter production schedules of virtually all leading car and truck manufacturers and of the industry as a whole are reflecting high and well-sustained dealer and consumer demand and other favorable but normal or seasonal influences . These factors . rather than a program of deliberate over-production now , in anticipation that output may be curtailed later by the direct or indirect effects of the national defense program . are mainly responsible for lifting the projected assemblies of the final three months of this year to 1.350.000 units or 16% above the previous peak for the period established last year . At the same time , however , authoritative industry sources point out that it is not unlikely that factory and dealer inventories of automobiles shortly may tend to show somewhat greater increases in relation to sales than would be seasonally warranted . To the limited extent that this occurs it will represent hedging against any and all of the many possible developments that could delay or curb car production and sales in future months . Proportionate RI.e In Inventories To date the rise in inventor:es @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statistical position of most companies and of the industry is much better than average for this season . Preliminary estimates place October retail sales at around 390.000 units and October 31 stocks of available cars at 267.000 units . inventories thus aprommated 6654- of a month 's supply at the October sales rate as compared with 58%. a year ago . 375 : - in 1938 , 130% in 1937 and 1045. in 1936 . With stocks likely to be further Increased in November and December , as is normal , their relation to sales by the end of the year probably will be somewhat higher than average for that date and possibly at about the usual relationship of January 30 . This is a natural consequense of the earlier than usual start of new model production and the unprecedentedly high level of retail and wholesale demand in the late autumn-early winter months . To service the demand , greater inventories are necessary : further , despite the fact that most companies by now have been able to supply their dealers with at least average stocks of cars , many plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal to a month 's production at the November rate . Although tae car and truck producers and their parts suppliers already have an aggregate of more than 51,000.000.000 In arms orders and expect to receive 1500.000,000 more in the spring when sub-contracts for bomber plane parts tooling and production are allotted , leaders in the industry believe that the armaments production in all its variety can be superimposed upon their regular automotive production without delaying or curtailing the latter . At the same time , all priority . of course , is being given the arms production . To Carry Larger inventories To safeguard against the possibility of even icmporary delay in production or shipments . which could result from the arms program or ? other causes , it is probable that both factories and dealers in coming months will carry larger than seasonal inventories of finished cars . As a matter of fact , since the industry changed its model year basis in 1935. there has been a tendency for the upward limits of " normal " seasonal inventories to show a constant rise : ' this is because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than being marked by the sharp spring peak that prevailed prior to 1935 .

Earlier Introduction of the new models has ? accomplished the redistributien of the peak demand of the late-first-carry-second quarters more evenly among the fourth . first and second quarters and has made the year 's low point the third quarter instead of the fourth . With the production load spread over a longer period . plants are able to make more efficient use of their facilities . Layoffs In Summer Months Seasonally lay-offs of workers during the period of changing over production facilities to new models from prior models now are concentrated in July . August and September . when the workers ' living expenses are lowest , workbag conditions are the most unpleasant and vacation trips are attractive .

This shows average factory sales I usually tantamount to outputs of passenger cars by periods , in terms of percentage ed. the calendar year total , for the years 1935-40 when new models have been available around October 1 . and for the years 1928-1935 when new models were introduced around January 1 . The year 1935 is included In both sets . of figures because it was the transition year of the change in the model year basis . Similar but not quite such marked changes have occurred in the year 's course of retail sales , shown below in the same basis as the above tabulation. 192S-35 Firm quarter heron . quarter First ha : Taro quarter Nine montru Fourth quarter Since 1935 , 10 months a year have each averaged more than 7,4- of the year 's production as compared with eight such months prior to 1935 , while nine months have each averaged better than 7 , - ; - of the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would account for 8 1 ' 3 " ; * t or 1 ' 12 , of the year 's total production and sales ; such perfect stability is impossible to attain , of course . Not only is consumer demand highly irregular and subject to only minor control by the factories but the factories necessarily must close down once a year to renew equipment and install the new machinery and methods that make possible the improvements of the annual new models . Shift In Peak Months Further highlighting the changes In season ality resulting from the production stability program , the industry 's peak months ( for production . now are December , November and April , in that order . against May . April and June prior to 1935 . Since the model year change . December has been the high month with ** of the year 's total as compared with a pre-1935 peak of 11.9 , , in May , which was almost equaled by April and June at 11.8% and 11.67 , ' , respectively .

More significantly , most companies have widened the margin of time between the actual national introduction of their new models and the opening of the show . Unlike previous years since the industry has been on approximately its present model year basis , this year 's high production month will not be December . but October . Month-to-month comparisons of this quarter with a year ago are affected by the fact that Chrysler Corp . 1939 bad its plants . with of the industry 's production capacity , closed by a strike in October and November and Chevrolet division of General Motors and Ford Motor were just attaining volume production near the end of October .
