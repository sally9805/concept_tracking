Twice in two years , Big Nine teams had invaded the Rose Bowl and made the Pacific Coast champions look like second-raters . Last week , a Big Nine team won again , but not until Northwestern Halfback Ed Tunnicliff broke loose for a 43-yard run in the last minutes of play . Final score : Northwestern 20 , California 14 . Some scores in other bowls ( 16 in all , which did a more than $2,000,000 business before some 600,000 fans ) : <P> Cotton . Southern Methodist , with help from Doak Walker and Kyle Rote , chopped heavier Oregon down to size , 21-13 . <P> Orange . Underdog Texas-usually pass-conscious-outplayed Georgia , principally in the line , and marched overland to a 41-28 victory . <P> Sugar . Underdog Oklahoma capitalized on " Choo Choo " Charlie Justice 's upset stomach and nipped unbeaten North Carolina , 14-6 . The Sugar Bowl basketball title went to St. Louis University , which outplayed Kentucky , 42-40 , in the season 's only scheduled meeting between last year 's two best college teams .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
