txt THE TAX RATE TREND , as far as can be judged . is likely to go downward rather than upward in the next few years . Granting this assumption , many tax-1 payers , particularly those on a cash basis , can legitimately take advantage of the uation to reduce their tax bills . In some i cases they can postpone the collection of ; taxable income until 1945. or they can pay . not later than December 31. due items that can be deducted from 1944 taxable income . Here are some ways a cash-basis tax- ! payer can reduce his 1944 Income and , con-. sequently , his tax for this year . If he owns income-producing property , he can pay repair and onaintenance bills due this year . He can pay local real estate and personal property taxes before the year closes , if they are due . He can pay interest on life insurance loans , instead of letting it ride and increasing ' the loan . He can , under certain circumstances , take bad debt deductions . Finally , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income adjustments affecting his tax bill ? ? ? PAYMENT NOW or later of bills for medical and dental expenses . hospitalization. etc .. would depend upon circumstances in each individual case . The law permits as a deduction that part of such expenses that exeeed of income . but limits the deduction to 51.250 for the single taxpayer , to $2,500 for husband and wife or a family head . Consequently , if the payment will bring the year ' ' , total of such expenses to less than 5 ' , of income , immediate payment will serve no purpose , while postponement of a settlement until January might help next year . Similarly . if the payment in full of a large bill would bring the deduction above the allowable maximum deduction limit , it might be advantageous to leave an unpaid balance until next year . A reverse side of the matter is that a doctor or dentist , also desirous of keeping his 1944 cash income down , might postpone sending out his bills until January 1 . ? ? ?

On the other hand , deferment of settlement might permit utilization of the amounts in 1945 returns . ? ? ? THE TREASURY in a new ruling ( I.T . 37001 has " amplified " its previous position regarding the effect of renegotiation on the excess profits credits of corporations using the- invested capital base for establishing these credits . The previous ruling ( I T. 36881 suggested that when profits of such a corporation were reduced by renegotiation , its invested capital should be reduced by the full sum renegotiated. reducing its credit proportion , ately . It was pointed out irr this column on September 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and logic . invested capital should be reduced by the sum renegotiated less the tax thereon .

The formal meetings between the special House-Senate post-war tax committee and Congressional and Treasury experts , which got under way last week and will continue into the new session of Congress . may produce legislation early next year ? in February or March . There is no thought of immediate cuts in rates . But theie is a strong sentiment among members of the committee and the experts , too , to put through changes which would make it easier for companies to meet their reconversion financing requirements . ? ? ? TWO AVENUES for accomplishing this are through the 10% post-war credits under the exceat profits tax and the carryback provision of the revenue laws .

Although supported by President Roosevelt and War Mobilization Director Byrnes , this proposal has yet to , , , win any substantial support in the joint committee and among the experts . It would permit a company to write off , for tax purposes , upward of one-third the cost of new facilities in the year they were acquired . Under present law , depreciation must be spread over the useful life of the property . The theory behind the rapid write-off in the first year is that it would encourage companies to keep their facilities up to date , and in this way spur production efficiency .
