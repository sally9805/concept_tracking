Sun , stand thou still upon Gibeon ; and thou , Moon , in the valley of Ajalon . And the sun stood still , and the moon stayed . <P> . . . - Joshua , X , 12-13 . <P> To the long line of men who have tried , like Joshua , to stop the sun while work was toward , last week was added Franklin Roosevelt. * The President asked Congress to pass a bill authorizing him to establish year-round , nationwide Daylight Saving Time . <P> The President called for daylight saving as a national defense measure . A mighty man is Franklin Roosevelt , with many powers unknown to Joshua , but last week he bumped spang up against something Joshua did n't have to contend with : the psyche of the U.S. cow . <P> Among objections to his proposal that were voiced last week was the assertion that the cow is no dull creature of sodden disposition , but a delicately organized mass of nerves , easily wrought up to the point of not giving down ; a sudden upset , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , might make a cow tense , thereby impairing the flow of milk necessary for national defense . Cows do indeed take a few days to get used to such a change , but their discomfort is nowhere nearly so great or so enduring as that of farmers . In wintertime dairy farmers already rise while it is dark , and under daylight saving they will have to rise and begin their work still earlier , in the coldest part of the night . <P> Moreover the months when they have to rise in darkness will be greatly extended . <P> In summertime this discomfort is not present , but setting the clock ahead has no effect on drying the dew off the grass , and dew immemorially has dried off about 9 a.m . Not until 10 a.m. daylight time , therefore , can much field work begin , so that whether or not they have to rise earlier to tend dairy cattle , their quitting time will be an hour later by the clock . <P> The President was expected to win in Congress although he claimed that Daylight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense . This amount of power totals exactly five-tenths of 1% of U.S. power production , is only about enough to run the 2,500,000 new electric refrigerators sold to citizens in the first six months of 1941 . <P> * William Willett , the sun-struck Briton who fathered daylight saving , died in 1915 as warring European nations adopted " summer time . " Willett argued for an 80-minute setback . U.S. Daylight Saving Father is Robert Garland , 78 , of Pittsburgh , who last week opposed the President 's plan for year-round daylight saving , said it would work hardship in winter .
