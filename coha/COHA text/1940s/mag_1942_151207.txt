( See Cover ) <P> If a chief of state could find a man on whose mind was imprinted , as if on animated microfilm , all the books by and about Clausewitz , Napoleon , Lee , Caesar , Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden , Sun Tzu of China and the rest of the great military theorists and practitioners , then the chief of state would be a fool to buy the books . Joseph Stalin has such a man in Boris Shaposhnikov . <P> To Russia 's Chief of State , Marshal Boris Shaposhnikov is officially Chief of Staff . But unofficially he is Joseph Stalin 's walking reference room and military mind . He is the author of a monumental book called Mozg Armii ( The Brain of the Army ) , and he is it . <P> While credit for tactical successes , or blame for reverses , must fall to such regional commanders as Timoshenko , Zhukov , Budenny and Voroshilov , there is only one man who can make the huge strategic decisions on which the war will be won or lost . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military decision without asking Boris Shaposhnikov what he would do . <P> As the momentum of Russia 's two strongest winter offensives dwindled last week and there began to be talk of spring , great new worries were reposed on the military mind of Joseph Stalin . <P> How far would the Russian drives carry ? How soon did Hitler plan to mount his inevitable spring offensive ? How big would it be when it came ? <P> Where would the Germans strike ? Where could the Russians hope to hold them ? When could they hope to win ? In seeking to answer these questions for his boss , Boris Shaposhnikov would have to riffle through the index of his incredible brain , snatch at the most applicable texts and apply them , in their proper seasons , to Russia 's war . <P> Clausewitz for Autumn . His favorite author , ironically , is the great German military critic , Karl von Clausewitz . One passage which he quotes with especially affectionate comment might well have been his text last week , as he reviewed the lessons of Autumn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Summer 1942 . <P> The commander , says Clausewitz , must guess whether , after receiving the initial blows , the core of the opponent 's Army is gradually becoming condensed , tempered and strengthened , or , to the contrary , beginning to crumble into dust like a decanter made of Bologna glass whose stir-face has been cracked . The commander must figure out with precision how much the enemy state will be weakened by the loss of certain sources of supply and by the disconnection of certain arteries . He must foretell without mistake whether the enemy will collapse in pain from the wounds inflicted on him , or hurl himself forward with frenzied might like a wounded and enraged bull . <P> It was plain that failure to obey these strictures to the letter had cost the Germans victory in the autumn . On the other hand , Russia had observed them in reverse-had tightened and strengthened its Army in the face of the early blows , had ( by moving factories and acquiring allies ) made provision to keep supply facilities from collapsing , had ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see when the enemy was preparing for each great charge .
