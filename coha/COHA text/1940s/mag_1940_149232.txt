Last week may have marked the beginning of the end of one of the strangest cities in the world : Shanghai . At the close of the Opium War , in 1842 , Great Britain took title to some unattractive mud flats between Soochow Creek and the Whangpoo River near the mouth of the 3,200-mile-long Yangtze . On those flats a metropolis spawned , a city not of one nation but of the world , where British taipans played polo in the long afternoons , where tough , good-humored American businessmen talked baseball , poker and politics , where short French soldiers laughed with not quite proper young ladies at the Cercle Sportif Franais , where Russian princes turned barbers and German barbers turned princes . It became a city of American complexion-of skyscrapers , streetcars , movie houses , as foreign to China as a city of bamboo huts and Buddhist temples would be on the marshes of the Chesapeake . <P> But if the body of Shanghai was international , its backbone was British . The city 's really big names-Sassoon , Macnaghten , Keswick-were British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of polite but huge profits , and , in the last three years , the main part of its resistance to Japanese imperialism . <P> Last week that resistance crumbled . In Tokyo , 126 ( out of 466 ) members of the lower house of the Diet signed a petition denouncing Britain 's " unpardonably atrocious " act in arresting nine Japanese as a retaliation for Japanese arrest of 15 alleged British spies . Next day the British War Office announced the withdrawal from Shanghai of Britain 's garrison , about 1,500 effectives of the Seaforth Highlanders , East Surreys and various technical corps . Decision for this move was thought to have been taken at least two months ago , because of the realization that Great Britain , fighting for its life in the Occident , could not possibly put up a winning fight east of Singapore . <P> This left Shanghai in the hands of some 1,200 U. S. Marines , a negligible French garrison and an overwhelmingly superior Japanese force . Shanghai 's senior foreign officer became Rear Admiral Moriji Takeda , who could presumably ask for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Settlement . Since the U. S. could not and would not assume responsibility for fighting off the Japanese alone , Shanghai 's International Settlement last week was as good as surrendered . Shanghailanders knew that they had lost their queer hybrid foreign city , not quite 100 years old .
