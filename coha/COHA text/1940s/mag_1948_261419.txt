The ancient Romans had an imaginative treatment for alcoholics : a live eel in a cup of wine . Forced to drink this lively cocktail , the tippler would presumably be disgusted by all future potations . Modern doctors are still using a variation of this old cure . Latest results on a remarkably large number of patients were reported last week in the New England Journal of Medicine . An alcoholic is given an injection of emetine* ( a nauseating drug derived from ipecac ) . Just before he vomits , he downs a glass of his favorite drink . After several such experiences , the patient begins to detest the taste , smell-or even sight-of liquor . Drs . Paul O'Hollaren and Frederick Lemere made their report from tests at Seattle 's Shadel Sanitarium . <P> During a 10-year period the sanitarium treated 2,323 patients ( 93% were men ) by the emetine method . They were of every type : business and professional men , neurotics , former inmates of state institutions . They received no other treatment , but were encouraged to stay sober @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for six months , 70% for a year , 60% for two years , 55% for three years , 40% for four years , more than 30% up to seven years , 25% up to 10 years or longer . <P> The best patients , concluded Drs . O'Hollaren and Lemere , were those who were happily married , successful , intelligent , emotionally stable , financially secure , interested in sobriety clubs ( like Alcoholics Anonymous ) . The worst risks were patients who were heavy drinkers before they were 30 , were highly nervous even when sober , had had delirium tremens , were restless in their jobs and careless about money . <P> <P> * The Keeley Institute uses injections of gold chloride , which do not cause nausea , but are supposed to destroy the appetite for liquor by some secret action .
