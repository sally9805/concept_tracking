It was early morning , but Ottawa 's Union Station was already jammed . The mayor was there with an air vice marshal , an Air Force band , a crowd of excited relatives . Some 200 Canadian airmen , from humble ground crewmen to two of Canada 's top aces , were coming home after long tours overseas . <P> The 200 piled off the train , impatiently shuffled into line for the official twaddle of an official welcome . Suddenly they broke ranks and the real welcoming began . One airman appeared , brandishing an ice-cream cone . Another shouted : " Cones again ! " Some of them had not seen an ice-cream cone in four years . <P> Royal Texans . Among them were two of the fighting Texans who crossed the Canadian border in such numbers before Pearl Harbor that the R.C.A.F. was sometimes called the " Royal Texas Air Force . " Flight Lieut . " Tex " Barrick had thumbed his way from Odessa , Tex. , to Canada , flown a Hurricane with the R.C.A.F. , received a D.F.M. from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of joining the U.S. Army Air Forces . Said he : " You guys in Canada gave me a chance to fight , you spent a lot of money making me a pilot . " <P> Another Texan turned Canadian was Air Gunner Raymond Carroll , veteran of 40 operational flights . Said he : " I married an English girl and as soon as this is over I 'm going to settle in Vancouver . " The crowd yelled approval . <P> Two Aces . Squadron Leader Bert Houle , of Massey , Ont. , commanded the crack City of Windsor Squadron which fought in Malta , the Middle East , Britain . He was best known for getting two Germans in 15 seconds . He " squirted " at one , went underneath it , saw another , " squirted " him too . He wore the D.F.C . <P> Best known of all the repatriates was Canada 's No. i ace , Flight Lieut . George ( " Screwball " ) Beurling , who has 31 combat kills to his credit , a D.S.O. , D.F.C . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada in 1942 , then went back to England . Probably home now for good , he will teach deflection gunnery to Canada 's fledglings . Said Spitfireman Beurling : " You could n't get me in a bomber . They 're too dangerous . . . . But the bombers are doing the real job . Fighter duels are just side shows . . , . "
