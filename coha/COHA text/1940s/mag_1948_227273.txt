Medical journals are generally full of straight , double or tall talk from and about doctors . For a change , some back talk from a patient has appeared in the British journal Lancet . This particular patient was so fed up that she went on for five columns . The burden of her complaint : hospital patients are not treated like grownup human beings . <P> Medicine &; Manners . Medical care in a hospital is fine , the anonymous patient wrote , but medical manners are terrible . First of all , she was kept waiting around in the clinic , " on the principle that a minute of the doctor 's time was more valuable than an hour of the patient 's . " Later she entered a ward where doctors and nurses kept asking her questions without even explaining who they were . They did not expect the patient to ask them any questions . <P> Worse still was the feeling of being used as a cringing guinea pig* for the instruction of students . " When the doctors and students gathered around , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain was . Then I was disregarded . For ten minutes or more they talked about me . . . as if I were not there . At the end of their incomprehensible conversation , when all my fears and suspicions had been aroused , they left me suddenly , without an explanation or so much as a nod of their heads . " <P> Worst of all was being told nothing , left in ignorance of what was wrong , what treatment was being followed , and why . " Why should an adult cease to be regarded as a normal and reasonable human being merely because he is in a hospital ? I am not talking about patients who are desperately ill or in great pain , but people in full command of their senses . . . They were all treated more or less like children . . . ordered about , humored , talked down to , but never taken seriously . " <P> Drafts &; Fears . In a two-column editorial , the Lancet sympathetically agreed that such medical manners might well be mended . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a class of students is nothing compared with the anxiety that can be created by an exchange of obscure and alarming terms over their heads . While some teachers never lose sight of their patient 's feelings , others . . . forget about the patient entirely , exposing him physically to drafts and mentally to fears while they compare his condition with other grave disorders , and make technical jokes when a student blunders . " <P> <P> *In Britain , any ward patient may be used for instruction in teaching hospitals unless he objects ; private patients are so used only if they have a rare ailment and consent . In the U.S. , ward patients and some private patients are used for instruction ; never-in theory-without their consent . When the need is explained , and doctors are tactful , patients in both countries often enjoy being used as specimens .
