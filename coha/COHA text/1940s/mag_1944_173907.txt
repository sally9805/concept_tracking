The first great field battle of World War I took place at Mons in Belgium , where a victorious German army , driving hard after the outgeneraled and defeated Allies , came up with Britain 's " contemptible little " professional army ( 80,000 men ) . General von Kluck threw 250,000 men against-them . But the Old Contemptibles stood their ground until their ranks were shot through &; through . <P> TIME Correspondent Jack Belden cabled the following account of the Battle of Mons ( continued from World War I ) , as it was fought last week with victorious Americans driving hard after an outgeneraled and defeated German Army : <P> The German general sat on the iron ladder inside the sugar refinery and stared at his black polished boots . From behind the stilled forms of the factory machinery a score of German officers peered questioningly at him but he gave no sign . There was no motion around him save the wisps of smoke that curled up around his bowed head as he puffed pensively on a fat Manila cigar . <P> Outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helplessness . The wounded lay amid the still burning wreckage of smashed German motor columns ; they were so many that there was no way to evacuate them . On the roads the prisoners marched eight abreast in a column a mile long and a Belgian woman danced up &; down with her finger across her throat screeching " Kaput Hitler ! " <P> The Home Stretch . It was the end of the trail for the German commander . He and other generals with remnants of five divisions had tried to dash out of Belgium into Germany to get behind the West Wall . But they had failed . Within 48 hours one U.S. armored and one U.S. infantry division had trapped and virtually destroyed them . Nearly 25,000 prisoners had been taken and two or three thousand killed . <P> The battle of Mons will rank as one of the most decisive actions in our campaign in Europe , for it was here that the German rear guard was smashed . Regardless of its importance , however , it will rank as one of the most curious battles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both marching north on parallel roads , expected a battle of such magnitude . <P> Rain of Death . The two forces collided on the morning of Sept. 3 , southwest of Mons. Fighter planes operating with the advance armor early discovered nearly 1500 enemy vehicles heading eastward toward the American lines , and immediately attacked them . Jammed on the roads in double and triple columns , the Germans still pressed eastward , for to them that was the way to safety and Germany . <P> By 9 a.m. two enemy columns began converging on Mons , striking the tail of our advanced armored unit in that city . The armor was soon cut off and encircled and the commander asked the infantry , which was following for mopping-up , to hurry to his aid .
