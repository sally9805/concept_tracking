Not since Lefty Grove led Connie Mack 's last great Philadelphia team to the 1931 pennant has an American League pitcher won 30 games in a season . Last week , with 1946 baseball at the three-quarter mark , the goal of all major-league pitchers was within the reach of not one , but three pitchers . <P> If hay fever did not get the best of him , big , easy-going Dave ( " Boo " ) Ferriss of the pennant-bound Boston Red Sox had a strong chance in his second year in the majors . Last week Ferriss showed no signs of sniffles as he polished off his 20 and 21st victories . <P> Bob Feller of the Cleveland Indians had already won 21 ( to 7 losses ) . He also had an ambitious eye on Rube Waddell 's season strikeout record of 347 . At week 's end Bobby had struck out 262 . If he failed to keep the pace , it would be partly his fault : Bobby , who decides which days he will pitch , tends to overwork himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's curly-headed Southpaw Hal Newhouser . In his first five major-league seasons ( 1939-43 ) , he had little control of his curve , less of his temper ; he won 34 games , lost 52 , threw away more than he likes to remember . Then one day he told Manager Steve O'Neill : " I 'm going to win for you next year . " He was voted the league 's most valuable player in ' 44 and ' 45 . Last week Hal shut out the Chicago White Sox with four hits for his 21st win ( 5 defeats ) . <P> While American Leaguers edged up on the magic 30 games , the National League - which is traditionally famed for classy pitching-had n't one pitcher who was a cinch to win 20.
