Be It Resolved . . . Californians , who last November voted the nation 's costliest old-ae pensions , last week reconsidered their budget-busting generosity . By a 400,000 majority , they slapped down demagogic George McLain 's Citizens ' Committee for Old Age Pensions ( TIME , Sept. 5 ) despite support of the plan by politically ambitious Jimmy Roosevelt . The new law will leave pensions at the increased level ( average : $70.63 a month ) which McLain pushed through a year ago , but will shave $65 million off the $200 million annual cost by boosting the retirement age from 63 back to 65 . It will also make relatives who can afford it responsible for the old folks once more . <P> Voters in Virginia and Texas put another dent in the rusty Southern argument that civil rights could best be guaranteed by letting the states do their own housecleaning .

They feared that the blank-check authority it granted the Byrd-controlled legislature to set up new voting requirements might prove more harmful to their cause than the present $1. so-a-year poll tax . In Texas , a straight anti-poll-tax 2 amendment went down by a 24,000-vote margin . Campaign strategists for Senator Robert Taft got off to a flying start in the 1950 elections by steering through an amendment eliminating straight-ticket voting from the Ohio ballot and substituting the " Masachusetts ballot , " which lists all candidates alphabetically by office and without regard to party . Taft supporters , who feared the drawing power of popular Democratic Governor Frank Lausche at the top of a straight-ticket ballot , figured the change was worth 100,000 votes to the Republicans next fall . Democrats prepared to challenge its legality . Pennsylvania became the 18th state to approve ( and New Jersey the 27th state to reject ) a bonus for World War II veterans . Pennsylvania will start passing out its $500 million bonus ( maximum payment : $500 ) within the next 90 days .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
