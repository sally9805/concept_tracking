Since 1933 , Chicago 's Provident Hospital for Negroes has delivered 3,826 babies without a single true maternal death . This fact , all the more remarkable since the maternal death rate among Negroes is elsewhere very high , was revealed last week by Director John Baldwin West to visiting members of the National Medical Association , who came to celebrate the hospital 's 50th anniversary . <P> No ordinary hospital is Provident . Founded in 1891 by a brilliant young Negro surgeon named Daniel Hale Williams , it was the first institution in the U.S. for training Negro nurses and interns . A number of white industrialists gave money for a frame house and 13 beds ; local Negroes donated such necessities as 8 Ib. of prunes , 8 Ib. of feathers , a bottle of Holland gin , a washboard , a pair of crutches , four cakes of soap . <P> Two years after Provident was opened , Dr. Williams* made it famous . For there he performed the first successful heart operation in medical history : he took three stitches in the heart of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he still worked 18 hours a day , sterilized water in an old wash boiler , scrubbed the walls and floor of the operating room every night . <P> In 1929 Philanthropist Julius Rosen wald raised $3,000,000 for a large , redbrick plant , linked the hospital to the University of Chicago . Today Provident is the biggest and best voluntary ( privately run ) Negro hospital in the U.S. It has 165 beds , handles 1,000 emergencies a month ( mostly charity ) , has 88 doctors on its staff ( eight of them whites ) . Among the staff consultants are such famed white doctors as Gynecologists Fred Lyman Adair and Joseph Bolivar DeLee . <P> Some Provident accomplishments reported by Dr. ' West last week : <P> &gt; Dr. Rudolf Schindler , inventor of the flexible gastroscope ( a sort of periscope which enables doctors to see the inside of the stomach ) , trained a Provident doctor in his work . Thus Provident is one of the few U.S. hospitals to have one of these important gastroscopic clinics . <P> &gt; Three-fourths of all Negro doctors who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten years , and many heads of Negro hospitals , are Provident-trained . Among its noted alumni : Dr. John Wesley Lawlah , dean of Howard University College of Medicine ; Dermatologist Theodore Kenneth Lawless and Surgeon Ulysses Grant Dailey , now at Provident . <P> * Dr. Williams was the first of two Negroes elected to the exclusive American College of Surgeons . The other : famed Skull Surgeon Louis Tompkins Wright of Harlem .
