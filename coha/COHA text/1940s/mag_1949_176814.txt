About the year 1560 , the people living near Jogjakarta in Java found a strange creature on the beach . It looked like a man , except that it was white . They chained it to a big square stone outside of town where all could watch and laugh at its antics . They called it " the white sea monkey . " <P> The " white monkey " chipped away at the stone , glowered at the people , and finally died , still chained . Years later , other white sea monkeys came to Jogjakarta and read what the first one had carved on the rock . In Latin he had written : " Laugh at your own stupidity , but do not laugh at the misfortunes of a poor man . " In French , Italian and Dutch he had repeated ( soon after Copernicus and before Galileo ) a sentence so as to form a circle : " So moves the world . " <P> The newly arrived white sea monkeys conquered Java , and before they were done , three-fourths of the globe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The long ground swell of anti-Westernism rose to a tidal wave after Pearl Harbor . It ebbed with Japan 's defeat , but nowhere in Asia did the white man regain his prewar position . <P> Last week a Western nation won a quick , clean-cut victory in Asia .

The U.N . Security Council adopted a U.S.-sponsored cease-fire order intended to dislodge the Dutch . Not even the Dutch themselves celebrated their victory . Queen Juliana deplored the violence . Said she : " It is a tragedy of human society that makes force the necessary reaction to force . . . We are all in God 's hands . " <P> Horrified Look . Many of the Security Council members returned grudgingly to Paris from their Christmas holidays to take up the Indonesian case . The shivering Council met on the cold stage of the Palais de Chaillot ; all week long the U.S. 's Philip Jessup sat huddled in his overcoat and muffler . The atmosphere was strained . The Dutch knew that their fellow U.N . members were about to jump on them with both feet . Said one Dutch delegation member : " That was a calculated risk we had to take .
