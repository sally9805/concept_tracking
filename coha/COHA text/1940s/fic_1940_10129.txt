was not the axiom he wanted . But this was a good man . One good man . You are going to be the left flank when we have the battle , he thought . I better not tell you that yet . It 's going to be an awfully small battle , he thought . But it 's going to be an awfully good one . Well , I always wanted to fight one on my own . I always had an opinion on what was wrong with everybody else 's , from Agincourt down . I will have to make this a good one . It is going to be small , but very select . If I have to do what I think I will have to do it will be very select indeed . " Listen , " he said to Anselmo . " I 'm awfully glad to see you . " " And me to see thee , " the old man said .

The Ingles was pleased and happy and they joked together . The Ingles said it all went well and he was not worried . The drink in his stomach warmed him and his feet were warming now climbing . " Not much on the road , " he said to the Ingles . " Good , " the Ingles told him . " You will show me when we get there . " Anselmo was happy now and he was very pleased that he had stayed there at the post of observation . If he had come in to camp it would have been all right . It would have been the intelligent and correct thing to have done under the circumstances , Robert Jordan was thinking . But he stayed as he was told , Robert Jordan thought . That 's the rarest thing that can happen in Spain . To stay in a storm , in a way , corresponds to a lot of things . It 's not for nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could certainly use a couple more who would stay . I most certainly could . I wonder if that Fernando would stay . It 's just possible . After all , he is the one who suggested coming out just now . Do you suppose he would stay ? Would n't that be good ? He 's just about stubborn enough . I 'll have to make some inquiries . Wonder what the old cigar store Indian is thinking about now . " What are you thinking about , Fernando ? " Robert Jordan asked . " Why do you ask ? " " Curiosity , " Robert Jordan said . " I am a man of great curiosity " I was thinking of supper , " Fernando said . " Do you like to eat ? " " Yes . Very much . " " How 's Pilar 's cooking ? " " Average , " Fernando answered . He 's a second Coolidge , Robert Jordan thought . But , you know . I have just a hunch that he would stay . The three of them plodded up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , " Pilar said to Robert Jordan . They had come in out of the storm to the smoky warmth of the cave and the woman had motioned Robert Jordan over to her with a nod of her head . " He 's gone to look for horses . " " Good . Did he leave any word for me ? " " Only that he had gone for horses . " " And we ? " " No se , " she said . " Look at him . " Robert Jordan had seen Pablo when he came in and Pablo had grinned at him . Now he looked over at him sitting at the board table and grinned and waved his hand . " Ingle 's , " Pablo called . " It 's still falling , Ingle 's . " Robert Jordan nodded at him . " Let me take thy shoes and dry them , " Maria said . " I will hang them here in the smoke of the fire . " " Watch out you do n't burn them , " Robert Jordan told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here barefoot . What 's the matter ? " he turned to Pilar . " Is this a meeting ? Have n't you any sentries out ? " " In this storm ? Que va . " There were six men sitting at the table and leaning back against the wall . Anselmo and Fernando were still shaking the snow from their jackets , beating their trousers and rapping their feet against the wall by the entrance . " Let me take thy jacket , " Maria said . " Do not let the snow melt on it . " Robert Jordan slipped out of his jacket , beat the snow from his trousers , and untied his shoes . " You will get everything wet here , " Pilar said . " It was thee who called me . " " Still there is no impediment to returning to the door for thy brushing . " " Excuse me , " Robert Jordan said , standing in his bare feet on the dirt floor . " Hunt me a pair of socks , Maria . "  | " The Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wood into the fire . " Hay que aprovechar el tiempo , " Robert Jordan told her . " You have to take advantage of what time there is . " " It is locked , " Maria said . " Here is the key , " and he tossed it over . " It does not fit this sack . " " It is the other sack . They are on top and at the side . " The girl found the pair of socks , closed the sack , locked it and brought them over with the key . " Sit down and put them on and rub thy feet well , ' she said . Robert Jordan grinned at her . " Thou canst not dry them with thy hair ? " he said for Pilar to hear . " What a swine , " she said . " First he is the Lord of the Manor . Now he is our ex-Lord Himself . Hit him with a chunk of wood , Maria . " " Nay , " Robert Jordan said to her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are happy ? " " Yes , " he said . " I think everything goes very well . " " Roberto , " Maria said . " Go sit down and dry thy feet and let me bring thee something to drink to warm thee . " " You would think that man had never dampened foot before , " Pilar said . " Nor that a flake of snow had ever fallen . " Maria brought him a sheepskin and put it on the dirt floor of the cave . " There , " she said . " Keep that under thee until thy shoes are dry . " The sheepskin was fresh dried and not tanned and as Robert Jordanrested his stocking feet on it he could feel it crackle like parchment . The fire was smoking and Pilar called to Maria , " Blow up the fire , worthless one . This is no smokehouse . " " Blow it thyself , " Maria said . " I am searching for the bottle that El Sordo left . " " It is behind his packs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as a sucking child ? "  | " No , " Maria said . " As a man who is cold and wet . And a man who has just come to his house . Here it is . " She brought the bottle to where Robert Jordan sat . " It is the bottle of this noon . With this bottle one could make a beautiful lamp . When we have electricity again , what a lamp we can make of this bottle . " She looked at the pinch-bottle admiringly . " How do you take this , Roberto ? " " I thought I was Ingles , " Robert Jordan said to her . " I call thee Roberto before the others , " she said in a low voice and blushed . " How do you want it , Roberto ? " " Roberto , " Pablo said thickly and nodded his head at Robert Jordan . " How do you want it , Don Roberto ? " " Do you want some ? " Robert Jordan asked him . Pablo shook his head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said with dignity . " Go with Bacchus , " Robert Jordan said in Spanish . " Who is Bacchus ? " Pablo asked . " A comrade of thine , " Robert Jordan said . " Never have I heard of him , " Pablo said heavily . " Never in these mountains . " " Give a cup to Anselmo , " Robert Jordan said to Maria . " It is he who is cold . " He was putting on the dry pair of socks and the whiskeyand water in the cup tasted clean and thinly warming . But it does not curl around inside of you the way the absinthe does , he thought . There is nothing like absinthe . Who would imagine they would have whiskey up here , he thought . But La Granja was the most likely place in Spain to find it when you thought it over . Imagine Sordo getting a bottle for the visiting dynamiter and then remembering to bring it down and leave it . It was n't just manners that they had . Manners would have been producingthe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French would have done and then they would have saved what was left for another occasion . No , the true thoughtfulness of thinking the visitor would like it and then bringing it down for him to enjoy when you yourself were engaged in something where there was every reason to think of no one else but yourself and of nothing but the matter in hand  --  that was Spanish . One kind of Spanish , he thought . Remembering to bring the whiskey was one of the reasons you loved these people . Do n't go romanticizing them , he thought.  |p205There  are as many sorts of Spanish as there are Americans . But still , bringing the whiskey was very handsome . " How do you like it ? " he asked Anselmo . The old man was sitting by the fire with a smile on his face , his big hands holding the cup . He shook his head . " No ? " Robert Jordan asked him . " The child put water in it , " Anselmo said . " Exactly as Roberto takes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No , " Anselmo told her . " Nothing special at all . But I like to feel it burn as it goes down . " " Give me that , " Robert Jordan told the girl , " and pour him some of that which burns . " He tipped the contents of the cup into his own and handed it back empty to the girl , who poured carefully into it from the bottle . " Ah , " Anselmo took the cup , put his head back and let it run down his throat . He looked at Maria standing holding the bottle and winked at her , tears coming from both his eyes . " That , " he said . " That . " Then he licked his lips . " That is what kills the worm that haunts us . " " Roberto , " Maria said and came over to him , still holding the bottle . " Are you ready to eat ? " " Is it ready ? " " It is ready when you wish it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Anselmo and Fernando . " " Let us eat then , " he told her . " And thou ? " " Afterwards with Pilar . " " Eat now with us . " " No . It would not be well . " " Come on and eat . In my country a man does not eat before his woman . " " That is thy country . Here it is better to eat after . " " Eat with him , " Pablo said , looking up from the table . " Eat with him . Drink with him . Sleep with him . Die with him . Follow the customs of his country . " " Are you drunk ? " Robert Jordan said , standing in front of Pablo . The dirty , stubble-faced man looked at him happily.  | " Yes , " Pablo said . " Where is thy country , Ingles , where the women eat with the men ? " " In Estados Unidos in the state of Montana . " " Is it there that the men wear skirts as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Scotland . " " But listen , " Pablo said . " When you wear skirts like that , Ingles  --  " " I do n't wear them , " Robert Jordan said . " When you are wearing those skirts , " Pablo went on , " what do you wear under them ? " " I do n't know what the Scotch wear , " Robert Jordan said . " I 've wondered myself . " " Not the Escoceses , " Pablo said . " Who cares about the Escoceses ? Who cares about anything with a name as rare as that ? Not me . I do n't care . You , I say , Ingles . You . What do you wear under your skirts in your country ? " " Twice I have told you that we do not wear skirts , " Robert Jordansaid . " Neither drunk nor in joke . " " But under your skirts , " Pablo insisted . " Since it is well known that you wear skirts . Even the soldiers . I have seen photographs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What do you wear under your skirts , Ingles ? " " Los cojones , " Robert Jordan said . Anselmo laughed and so did the others who were listening ; all except Fernando . The sound of the word , of the gross word spoken before the women , was offensive to him . " Well , that is normal , " Pablo said . " But it seems to me that with enough cojones you would not wear skirts . " " Do n't let him get started again , Ingles , " the flat-faced man with the broken nose who was called Primitivo said . " He is drunk . Tell me , what do they raise in your country ? " " Cattle and sheep , " Robert Jordan said . " Much grain also and beans . And also much beets for sugar . " The three were at the table now and the others sat close by except Pablo , who sat by himself in front of a bowl of the wine . It was the same stew as the night before and Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are mountains ? With that name surely there are mountains , " Primitivo asked politely to make conversation . He was embarrassed at the drunkenness of Pablo.  | " Many mountains and very high . " " And are there good pastures ? " " Excellent ; high pasture in the summer in forests controlled by the government . Then in the fall the cattle are brought down to the lower ranges . " " Is the land there owned by the peasants ? " " Most land is owned by those who farm it . Originally the land was owned by the state and by living on it and declaring the intention of improving it , a man could obtain title to a hundred and fifty hectares . " " Tell me how this is done , " Agustin asked . " That is an agrarian reform which means something . " Robert Jordan explained the process of homesteading . He had never thought of it before as an agrarian reform . " That is magnificent , " Primitivo said . " Then you have a communismin your country ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " For me , " Agustin said , " everything can be done under the Re public . I see no need for other form of government . " " Do you have no big proprietors ? " Andres asked . " Man " Y  --  " Then there must be abuses . " " Certainly . There are many abuses . " " But you will do away with them ? " " We try to more and more . But there are many abuses still . " " But there are not great estates that must be broken up ? " " Yes . But there are those who believe that taxes will break themup . " " How ? " Robert Jordan , wiping out the stew bowl with bread , explained how the income tax and inheritance tax worked . " But the big estates remain . Also there are taxes on the land , " he said . " But surely the big proprietors and the rich will make a revolution against such taxes . Such taxes appear to me to be revolutionary . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are threatened , exactly as the fascists have done here , " Primitivo said . " It is possible . " " Then you will have to fight in your country as we fight here . " " Yes , we will have to fight . "  | " But are there not many fascists in your country ? " " There are many who do not know they are fascists but will find it out when the time comes . " " But you can not destroy them until they rebel ? " " No , " Robert Jordan said . " We can not destroy them . But we can educate the people so that they will fear fascism and recognize it as it appears and combat it . " " Do you know where there are no fascists ? " Andres asked . " Where ? " " In the town of Pablo , " Andres said and grinned . " You know what was done in that village ? " Primitivo asked Robert Jordan . " Yes . I have heard the story . " " From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hear all of it from the woman , " Pablo said heavily . " Because she did not see the end of it because she fell from a chair outside of the window . " " You tell him what happened then , " Pilar said . " Since I know not the story , let you tell it . " " Nay , " Pablo said . " I have never told it . " " No , " Pilar said . " And you will not tell it . And now you wish it had not happened . " " No , " Pablo said . " That is not true . And if all had killed the fascistsas I did we would not have this war . But I would not have had it happen as it happened . " " Why do you say that ? " Primitivo asked him . " Are you changing your politics ? " " No . But it was barbarous , " Pablo said . " In those days I - vas very barbarous . " " And now you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pablo said . " With your permission . " " I liked you better when you were barbarous , " the woman said . " Of all men the drunkard is the foulest . The thief when he is not stealing is like another . The extortioner does not practise in the home . The murderer when he is at home can wash his hands . But the drunkard stinks and vomits in his own bed and dissolves his organs in  | " You are a woman and you do not understand , " Pablo said equably . " I am drunk on wine and I would be happy except for those people I have killed . All of them fill me with sorrow . " He shook his head lugubriously . " Give him some of that which Sordo brought , " Pilar said . " Give him something to animate him . He is becoming too sad to bear . " " If I could restore them to life , I would , " Pablo said . " Go and obscenity thyself , " Agustin said to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would bring them all back to life , " Pablo said sadly . " Every one . " " Thy mother , " Agustin shouted at him . " Stop talking like this or get out . Those were fascists you killed . " " You heard me , " Pablo said . " I would restore them all to life . " " And then you would walk on the water , " Pilar said . " In my life I have never seen such a man . Up until yesterday you preserved some remnants of manhood . And today there is not enough of you left to make a sick kitten . Yet you are happy in your soddenness . " " We should have killed all or none , " Pablo nodded his head . " All or none . " " Listen , Ingles , " Agustin said . " How did you happen to come to Spain ? Pay no attention to Pablo . He is drunk . " " I came first twelve years ago to study the country and the Ian , guage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a university . " " You look very little like a professor , " Primitivo said . " He has no beard , " Pablo said . " Look at him . He has ne beard . " " Are you truly a professor ? " " An instructor . " " But you teach ? " " Yes . " " But why Spanish ? " Andres asked . " Would it not be easier to teach English since you are English ? " " He speaks Spanish as we do , " Anselmo said . " Why should he not teach Spanish ? " " Yes . But it is , in a way , presumptuous for a foreigner to teach Spanish , " Fernando said . " I mean nothing against you , Don Ro-berto. "  | " He 's a false professor , " Pablo said , very pleased with himself . " He has n't got a beard . " " Surely you know English better , " Fernando said . " Would it not be better and easier and clearer to teach English ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pilar started to intervene . " I should hope not , " Fernando said . " Let me finish , you mule , " Pilar said to him . " He teaches Spanish to Americans . North Americans . " " Can they not speak Spanish ? " Fernando asked . " South Americanscan . " " Mule , " Pilar said . " He teaches Spanish to North Americans who speak English . " " Still and all I think it would be easier for him to teach English if that is what he speaks , " Fernando said . " Ca n't you hear he speaks Spanish ? " Pilar shook her head hopelesslyat Robert Jordan . " Yes . But with an accent . " " Of where ? " Robert Jordan asked . " Of Estremadura , " Fernando said primly . " Oh my mother , " Pilar said . " What a people ! " " It is possible , " Robert Jordan said . " I have come here from there . " " As he well knows , " Pilar said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Have you had enough to eat ? " " I could eat more if there is a sufficient quantity , " Fernando told her . " And do not think that I wish to say anything against you , Don Roberto " " Milk , " Agustin said simply . " And milk again . Do we make the revolution in order to say Don Roberto to a comrade ? " " For me the revolution is so that all will say Don to all , " Fernando said . " Thus should it be under the Republic . " " Milk , " Agustin said . " Black milk . " " And I still think it would be easier and clearer for Don Roberto to teach English . " " Don Roberto has no beard , " Pablo said . " He is a false professor . " " What do you mean , I have no beard ? " Robert Jordan said . " What 's this ? " He stroked his chin and his cheeks where the threedaygrowth made a blond stubble . FOR WHOM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pablo said . He shook his head . " That 's not a beard . " He was almost jovial now . " He 's a false professor . " " I obscenity in the milk of all , " Agustin said , " if it does not seem like a lunatic asylum here . " " You should drink , " Pablo said to him . " To me everything appearsnormal . Except the lack of beard of Don Roberto . " Maria ran her hand over Robert Jordan 's cheek . " He has a beard , " she said to Pablo . " You should know , " Pablo said and Robert Jordan looked at him . I do n't think he is so drunk , Robert Jordan thought . No , not so drunk . And I think I had better watch myself . " Thou , " he said to Pablo . " Do you think this snow will last ? " " What do you think ? " " I asked you . " " Ask another , " Pablo told him . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper from thy service of information . Ask the woman . She commands . " " I asked thee . " " Go and obscenity thyself , " Pablo told him . " Thee and the woman and the girl . " " He is drunk , " Primitivo said . " Pay him no heed , Ingles . " " I do not think he is so drunk , " Robert Jordan said . Maria was standing behind him and Robert Jordan saw Pablo watching her over his shoulder . The small eyes , like a boar 's , were watching her out of the round , stubble-covered head and Robert Jordan thought : I have known many killers in this war and some before and they were all different ; there is no common trait nor feature ; nor any such thing as the criminal type ; but Pablo is certainly not handsome . " I do n't believe you can drink , " he said to Pablo . " Nor that you 're drunk . " " I am drunk , " Pablo said with dignity . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is important . Estoy muy borracho . " " I doubt it , " Robert Jordan told him . " Cowardly , yes . " It was so quiet in the cave , suddenly , that he could hear the hissingnoise the wood made burning on the hearth where Pilar cooked , He heard the sheepskin crackle as he rested his weight on his feet.  |p2I2  He thought he could almost hear the snow falling outside . He could not , but he could hear the silence where it fell . I 'd like to kill him and have it over with , Robert Jordan was thinking . I do n't know what he is going to do , but it is nothing good . Day after tomorrow is the bridge and this man is bad and he constitutes a danger to the success of the whole enterprise . Come on . Let us get it over with . Pablo grinned at him and put one finger up and wiped it across his throat . He shook his head that turned only a little each way on his thick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " Do not provoke me . " He looked at Pilar and said to her , " It is not thus that you get rid of me . " " Sinverguenza , " Robert Jordan said to him , committed now in his own mind to the action . " Cobarde . " " It is very possible , " Pablo said . " But I am not to be provoked . Take something to drink , Ingle 's , and signal to the woman it was not successful . " " Shut thy mouth , " Robert Jordan said . " I provoke thee for my-self . " " It is not worth the trouble , " Pablo told him . " I do not provoke . " " Thou art a bicho raro , " Robert Jordan said , not wanting to let it go ; not wanting to have it fail for the second time ; knowing as he spoke that this had all been gone through before ; having that feeling that he was playing a part from memory of something that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a circle . " Very rare , yes , " Pablo said . " Very rare and very drunk . To your health , Ingle 's . " He dipped a cup in the wine bowl and held it up . " Salud y cojones . " He 's rare , all right , Robert Jordan thought , and smart , and very complicated . He could no longer hear the fire for the sound of his own breathing . " Here 's to you , " Robert Jordan said , and dipped a cup into the wine . Betrayal would n't amount to anything without all these pledges , he thought . Pledge up . " Salud , " he said . " Salud and Salud again , " you salud , he thought . Salud , you salud . " Don Roberto , " Pablo said heavily . " Don Pablo , " Robert Jordan said . " You 're no professor , " Pablo said , " because you have n't got a beard.  |p213And  also to do away with me you have to assassinate me and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was looking at Robert Jordan with his mouth closed so that his lips made a tight line , like the mouth of a fish , Robert Jordan thought . With that head it is like one of those porcupine fish that swallow air and swell up after they are caught . " Salud , Pablo , " Robert Jordan said and raised the cup up and drank from it . " I am learning much from thee . " " I am teaching the professor , " Pablo nodded his head . " Come on , Don Roberto , we will be friends . " " We are friends already , " Robert Jordan said . " But now we will be good friends . " " We are good friends already . " " I 'm going to get out of here , " Agustin said . " Truly , it is said that we must eat a ton of it in this life but I have twenty-five pounds of it stuck in each of my ears this minute . " " What is the matter , negro ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see friendship between Don Roberto and me ? " " Watch your mouth about calling me negro . " Agustin went over to him and stood in front of Pablo holding his hands low . " So you are called , " Pablo said . " Not by thee . " " Well , then , Blanco --  " " Nor that , either . " " What are you then , red ? " " Yes . Red . Rojo . With the red star of the army and in favor of the Republic . And my name is Agustin . " " What a patriotic man , " Pablo said . " Look , Ingles , what an ex-emplarypatriot . " Agustin hit him hard across the mouth with his left hand , bringingit forward in a slapping , backhand sweep . Pablo sat there . The corners of his mouth were wine-stained and his expression did not change , but Robert Jordan watched his eyes narrow , as a cat 's pupils close to vertical slits in a strong light . " Nor this , " Pablo said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He turned his head toward Pilar . " I am not provoked . " Agustin hit him again . This time he hit him on the mouth with his closed fist . Robert Jordan was holding his pistol in his hand under the table . He had shoved the safety catch off and he pushed Maria away with his left hand . She moved a little way and he pushed her hard in the ribs with his left hand again to make her get really away . She was gone now and he saw her from the corner of his eye , slipping along the side of the cave toward the fire and now Robert Jordan watched Pablo 's face . The round-headed man sat staring at Agustin from his flat little eyes . The pupils were even smaller now . He licked his lips then , put up an arm and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand , looked down and saw the blood on his hand . He ran his tongue over his lips , then spat . " Nor that , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not provoke . " " Cabron , " Agustin said . " You should know , " Pablo said . " You know the woman . " Agustin hit him again hard in the mouth and Pablo laughed at him , showing the yellow , bad , broken teeth in the reddened line of his mouth . " Leave it alone , " Pablo said and reached with a cup to scoop some wine from the bowl . " Nobody here has co/ones to kill me and this of the hands is silly . " " Cobarde , " Agustin said . " Nor words either , " Pablo said and made a swishing noise rinsing the wine in his mouth . He spat on the floor . " I am far past words . " Agustin stood there looking down at him and cursed him , speakingslowly , clearly , bitterly and contemptuously and cursing as steadilyas though he were dumping manure on a field , lifting it with a dung fork out of a wagon . " Nor of those , " Pablo said . " Leave it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wilt injure thy hands . " Agustin turned from him and went to the door . " Do not go out , " Pablo said . " It is snowing outside . Make thyself comfortable in here . " " And thou ! Thou ! " Agustin turned from the door and spoke to him , putting all his contempt in the single , " Tu . " " Yes , me , " said Pablo . " I will be alive when you are dead . " He dipped up another cup of wine and raised it to Robert Jordan . " To the professor , " he said . Then turned to Pilar . " To the Senora Commander . " Then toasted them all , " To all the illusioned ones . "  |p2I5Agustin  walked over to him and , striking quickly with the side of his hand , knocked the cup out of his hand . " That is a waste , " Pablo said . " That is silly . " Agustin said something vile to him . " No , " Pablo said , dipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thou ? When I am not drunk I do not talk .

" I know too much about thee and thy cowardice . " " How the woman talks , " Pablo said . " I will be going out to see the horses . " " Go and befoul them , " Agustin said . " Is not that one of thy customs ? " " No , " Pablo said and shook his head . He was taking down his big blanket cape from the wall and he looked at Agustin . " Thou , " he said , " and thy violence . " " What do you go to do with the horses ? " Agustin said . " Look to them , " Pablo said . " Befoul them , " Agustin said . " Horse lover . " " I care for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from behind they are handsomer and have more sense than these people . Divert your , selves , " he said and grinned . " Speak to them of the bridge , Inglis . Explain their duties in the attack . Tell them how to conduct the retreat . Where will you take them , Inglis , after the bridge ? Where will you take your patriots ? I have thought of it all day while I have been drinking . " " What have you thought ? " Agustin asked . " What have I thought ? " Pablo said and moved his tongue around exploringly inside his lips . " Que to importa , what have I thought . " " Say it , " Agustin said to him . " Much , " Pablo said . He pulled the blanket coat over his head , the roundness of his head protruding now from the dirty yellow folds of the blanket . " I have thought much . " " What ? " Agustin said . " What ? " " I have thought you are a group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman with her brains between her thighs and a for signer who comes to destroy you . "  | " Get out , " Pilar shouted at him . " Get out and fist yourself into the snow . Take your bad milk out of here , you horse exhausted maricon . " " Thus one talks , " Agustin said admiringly , but absent-mindedly . He was worried . " I go , " said Pablo . " But I will be back shortly . " He lifted the blanket over the door of the cave and stepped out . Then from the door he called , " It 's still falling , Ingles. "  |p217THE  ONLY noise in the cave now was the hissing from the hearth where snow was falling through the hole in the roof onto the coals of the fire . " Pilar , " Fernando said . " Is there more of the stew ? " " Oh , shut up , " the woman said . But Maria took Fernando 's bowl over to the big pot set back from the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to the table and set it down and then patted Fernando on the shoulder as he bent to eat . She stood for a moment beside him , her hand on his shoulder . But Fernando did not look up . He was devoting himself to the stew . Agustin stood beside the fire . The others were seated . Pilar sat at the table opposite Robert Jordan . " Now , Ingles , " she said , " you have seen how he is . " " What will he do ? " Robert Jordan asked . " Anything , " the woman looked down at the table . " Anything . He is capable of doing anything . " " Where is the automatic rifle ? " Robert Jordan asked . " There in the corner wrapped in the blanket , " Primitivo said . " Do you want it ? " " Later , " Robert Jordan said . " I wished to know where it is . " " It is there , " Primitivo said . " I brought it in and I have wrapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The pans are in that sack . " " He would not do that , " Pilar said . " He would not do anything with the maquina . " " I thought you said he would do anything . " " He might , " she said . " But he has no practice with the mdquina . He could toss in a bomb . That is more his style . " " It is an idiocy and a weakness not to have killed him , " the gypsy said . He had taken no part in any of the talk all evening . " Last night Roberto should have killed him . " " Kill him , " Pilar said . Her big face was dark and tired looking . " I am for it now . "  | " I was against it , " Agustin said . He stood in front of the fire , his long arms hanging by his sides , his cheeks , stubble-shadowed belowthe cheekbones , hollow in the firelight . " Now I am for it , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us all de-stroyed . " " Let all speak , " Pilar said and her voice was tired . " Thou , Andres ? " " Matarlo , " the brother with the dark hair growing far down in the point on his forehead said and nodded his head . " Eladio ? " " Equally , " the other brother said . " To me he seems to constitute a great danger . And he serves for nothing . " " Primitivo ? " " Equally . " " Fernando ? " " Could we not hold him as a prisoner ? " Fernando asked . " Who would look after a prisoner ? " Primitivo said . " It would take two men to look after a prisoner and what would we do with him in the end ? " " We could sell him to the fascists , " the gypsy said . " None of that , " Agustin said . " None of that filthiness . " " It was only an idea , " Rafael , the gypsy , said . " It seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Leave it alone , " Agustin said . " That is filthy . " " No filthier than Pablo , " the gypsy justified himself . " One filthiness does not justify another , " Agustin said . " Well , that is all . Except for the old man and the Ingles . " " They are not in it , " Pilar said . " He has not been their leader . " " One moment , " Fernando said . " I have not finished . " " Go ahead , " Pilar said . " Talk until he comes back . Talk until he rolls a hand grenade under that blanket and blows this all up . Dynamite and all . " " I think that you exaggerate , Pilar , " Fernando said . " I do not think that he has any such conception . " " I do not think so either , " Agustin said . " Because that would blow the wine up too and he will be back in a little while to the wine . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ El Sordo sell himp2I9to the fascists ? " Rafael suggested . " You could blind him and he would be easy to handle . " " Shut up , " Pilar said . " I feel something very justified against thee too when thou talkest . " " The fascists would pay nothing for him anyway , " Primitivo said . " Such things have been tried by others and they pay nothing . They will shoot thee too . " " I believe that blinded he could be sold for something , " Rafael said . " Shut up , " Pilar said . " Speak of blinding again and you can go with the other . " " But , he , Pablo , blinded the guardia civil who was wounded , " the gypsy insisted . " You have forgotten that ? " " Close thy mouth , " Pilar said to him . She was embarrassed beforeRobert Jordan by this talk of blinding . " I have not been allowed to finish , " Fernando interrupted . " Finish , " Pilar told him . " Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold Pablo as a prisoner , " Fernando commenced , " and since it is repugnant to offer him  --  " " Finish , " Pilar said . " For the love of God , finish . " "  --  in any class of negotiation , " Fernando proceeded calmly , " I am agreed that it is perhaps best that he should be eliminated in order that the operations projected should be insured of the maximumpossibility of success . " Pilar looked at the little man , shook her head , bit her lips and said nothing . " That is my opinion , " Fernando said . " I believe we are justified in believing that he constitutes a danger to the Republic --  " Mother of God , " Pilar said . " Even here one man can make a bureaucracy with his mouth . " " Both from his own words and his recent actions , " Fernando continued . " And while he is deserving of gratitude for his actions in the early part of the movement and up until the most recent time  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came up to the table . " Fernando , " Pilar said quietly and handed a bowl to him . " Take this stew please in all formality and fill thy mouth with it and talk no more . We are in possession of thy opinion . "  | " But , how then  --  " Primitivo asked and paused without completingthe sentence . " Estoy listo , " Robert Jordan said . " I am ready to do it . Since you are all decided that it should be done it is a service that I can do . " What 's the matter ? he thought . From listening to him I am beginning to talk like Fernando . That language must be infectious . French , the language of diplomacy . Spanish , the language of bureaucracy . " No , " Maria said . " No . " " This is none of thy business , " Pilar said to the girl . " Keep thy mouth shut . " " I will do it tonight , " Robert Jordan said . He saw Pilar looking at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the door . The blanket fastened across the opening of the cave was lifted and Pablo put his head in . He grinned at them all , pushed under the blanket and then turned and fastened it again . He turned around and stood there , then pulled the blanket cape over his head and shook the snow from it . " You were speaking of me ? " he addressed them all . " I am in-terrupting ? " No one answered him and he hung the cape on a peg in the wall and walked over to the table . " Que tal ? " he asked and picked up his cup which had stood empty on the table and dipped it into the wine bowl . " There is no wine , " he said to Maria . " Go draw some from the skin . " Maria picked up the bowl and went over to the dusty , heavily distended , black-tarred wineskin that hung neck down from the wall and unscrewed the plug from one of the legs enough so that the wine squirted from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched her kneeling , holding the bowl up and watched the light red wine flooding into the bowl so fast that it made a whirling motion as it filled it . " Be careful , " he said to her . " The wine 's below the chest now . " No one said anything . " I drank from the belly-button to the chest today , " Pablo said . " It 's a day 's work . What 's the matter with you all ? Have you lost your tongues ? " FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS 221p221No one said anything at all . " Screw it up , Maria , " Pablo said . " Do n't let it spill . " " There 'll be plenty of wine , " Agustin said . " You 'll be able to be drunk . " " One has encountered his tongue , " Pablo said and nodded to Agustin . " Felicitations . I thought you 'd been struck dumb . " " By what ? " Agustin asked . " By my entry . " " Thinkest thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself up to it , maybe , Robert Jordan thought . Maybe Agustin is going to do it . He certainly hates him enough . I do n't hate him , he thought . No , I do n't hate him . He is disgusting but I do not hate him . Though that blinding business puts him in a special class . Still this is their war . But he is certainly nothing to have around for the next two days . I am going to keep away out of it , he thought . I made a fool of myself with him once tonight and I am perfectly willing . o liquidate him . But I am not going to fool with him beforehand . And there are not going to be any shooting matches or monkey business in here with that dynamite around either . Pablo thought of that , of course . And did you think of it , he said to himself ? No , you did not and neither did Agustin . You deserve whatever happens to you , he thought . " Agustin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up sullenly and turned his head away from Pablo . " I wish to speak to thee , " Robert Jordan said . " Later . " " Now , " Robert Jordan said . " Por favor . " Robert Jordan had walked to the opening of the cave and Pablo followed him with his eyes . Agustin , tall and sunken cheeked , stood up and came over to him . He moved reluctantly and contemptuously . " Thou hast forgotten what is in the sacks ? " Robert Jordan said to him , speaking so low that it could not be heard . " Milk ! " Agustin said . " One becomes accustomed and one for-gets . " " I , too , forgot . " " Milk ! " Agustin said . " Leche ! What fools we are . " He swungp222back loose-jointedly to the table and sat down . " Have a drink , Pablo , old boy , " he said . " How were the horses ? " " Very good , " Pablo said . " And it is snowing less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , " Pablo said . " It is thinning now and there are small , hard pellets . The wind will blow but the snow is going . The wind has changed . " " Do you think it will clear tomorrow ? " Robert Jordan asked him . " Yes , " Pablo said . " I believe it will be cold and clear . This wind is shifting . " Look at him , Robert Jordan thought . Now he is friendly . He has shifted like the wind . He has the face and the body of a pig and I know he is many times a murderer and yet he has the sensitivityof a good aneroid . Yes , he thought , and the pig is a very intelligent animal , too . Pablo has hatred for us , or perhaps it is only for our projects , and pushes his hatred with insults to the point where you are ready to do away with him and when he sees that this point has been reached he drops it and starts all new and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , Ingles , " Pablo said to Robert Jordan . " We , " Pilar said . " We ? " " Yes , we , " Pablo grinned at her and drank some of the wine . " Why not ? I thought it over while I was outside . Why should we not agree ? " " In what ? " the woman asked . " In what now ? " " In all , " Pablo said to her . " In this of the bridge . I am with thee now . " You are with us now ? " Agustin said to him . " After what you have said ? " " Yes , " Pablo told him . " With the change of the weathe I am with thee . " Agustin shook his head . " The weather , " he said and shook his head again . " And after me hitting thee in the face ? " " Yes , " Pablo grinned at him and ran his fingers over his lips . " After that too . " Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asp223at some strange animal . On her face there was still a shadow of the expression the mention of the blinding had put there . She shook her head as though to be rid of that , then tossed it back , " Listen , " she said to Pablo . " Yes , woman . " " What passes with thee ? " " Nothing , " Pablo said . " I have changed my opinion . Nothing more . " " You were listening at the door , " she told him . " Yes , " he said . " But I could hear nothing . " " You fear that we will kill thee . " " No , " he told her and looked at her over the wine cup . " I do not fear that . You know that . " " Well , what passes with thee ? " Agustin said . " One moment you are drunk and putting your mouth on all of us and disassociatingyourself from the work in hand and speaking of our death in a dirty manner and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I was drunk , " Pablo told him . " And now  --  " " I am not drunk , " Pablo said . " And I have changed my mind . " " Let the others trust thee . I do not , " Agustin said . " Trust me or not , " Pablo said . " But there is no one who can take thee to Gredos as I can . " " Gredos ? " " It is the only place to go after this of the bridge . " Robert Jordan , looking at Pilar , raised his hand on the side away from Pablo and tapped his right ear questioningly . The woman nodded . Then nodded again . She said something to Maria and the girl came over to Robert Jordan 's side . " She says , Of course he heard , ' " Maria said in Robert Jordan 's ear . " Then Pablo , " Fernando said judicially . " Thou art with us now and in favor of this of the bridge ? " " Yes , man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eye and nodded . " In truth ? " Primitivo asked . " De veras , " Pablo told him.  | " And you think it can be successful ? " Fernando asked . " You now have confidence ? " " Why not ? " Pablo said . " Have n't you confidence ? " " Yes , " Fernando said . " But I always have confidence . " " I 'm going to get out of here , " Agustin said . " It is cold outside , " Pablo told him in a friendly tone . " Maybe , " Agustin said . " But I ca n't stay any longer in thismanicomio . " " Do not call this cave an insane asylum , " Fernando said . " A manicomio for criminal lunatics , " Agustin said . " And I 'm getting out before I 'm crazy , too . "  |p225It  IS LIKE a merry-go-round , Robert Jordan thought . Not a merrygo-roundthat travels fast , and with a calliope for music , and the children ride on cows with gilded horns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there is the blue , gas-flare-lit early dark of the Avenue du Maine , with fried fish sold from the next stall , and a wheel of fortune turning with the leather flaps slapping against the posts of the numbered compartments , and the packages of lump sugar piled in pyramids for prizes . No , it is not that kind of a merrygo-round ; although the people are waiting , like the men in caps and the women in knitted sweaters , their heads bare in the gaslight and their hair shining , who stand in front of the wheel of fortune as it spins . Yes , those are the people . But this is another wheel . This is like a wheel that goes up and around . It has been around twice now . It is a vast wheel , set at an angle , and each time it goes around and then is back to where it starts . One side is higher than the other and the sweep it makes lifts you back and down to where you started . There are no prizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ride this wheel . You ride it each time and make the turn with no intention ever to have mounted . There is only one turn ; one large , elliptical , rising and falling turn and you are back where you have started . We are back again now , he thought , and nothing is settled . It was warm in the cave and the wind had dropped outside . Now he was sitting at the table with his notebook in front of him figuring all the technical part of the bridge-blowing . He drew three sketches , figured his formulas , marked the method of blowingwith two drawings as clearly as a kindergarten project so that Anselmo could complete it in case anything should happen to himselfduring the process of the demolition . He finished these sketches and studied them . Maria sat beside him and looked over his shoulder while he worked . He was conscious of Pablo across the table and of the others talking and playing cards and he smelled the odors of the cave which had changed now from those of the meal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the tobacco , red-wine and brassy , stale body smell , and when Maria , watching him finishinga drawing , put her hand on the table he picked it up with his left hand and lifted it to his face and smelled the coarse soap and water freshness from her washing of the dishes . He laid her hand down without looking at her and went on working and he could not see her blush . She let her hand lie there , close to his , but he did not lift it again . Now he had finished the demolition project and he took a new page of the notebook and commenced to write out the operation orders . He was thinking clearly and well on these and what he wrote pleased him . He wrote two pages in the notebook and read them over carefully . I think that is all , he said to himself . It is perfectly clear and I do not think there are any holes in it . The two posts will be destroyedand the bridge will be blown according to Golz 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this business of Pablo is something with which I should never have been saddled and it will be solved one way or another . There will be Pablo or there will be no Pablo . I care nothing about it either way . But I am not going to get on that wheel again . Twice I have been on that wheel and twice it has gone around and come back to where it started and I am taking no more rides on it . He shut the notebook and looked up at Maria , " Hola , guapa , " he said to her . " Did you make anything out of all that ? " " No , Roberto , " the girl said and put her hand on his hand that still held the pencil . " Have you finished ? " " Yes . Now it is all written out and ordered . " " What have you been doing , Ingles ? " Pablo asked from across the table . His eyes were bleary again . Robert Jordan looked at him closely . Stay off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step on that wheel . I think it is going to start to swing again . " Working on the problem of the bridge , " he said civilly . " How is it ? " asked Pablo . " Very good , " Robert Jordan said . " All very good . " " I have been working on the problem of the retreat , " Pablop227said and Robert Jordan looked at his drunken pig eyes and at the wine bowl . The wine bowl was nearly empty . Keep off the wheel , he told himself . He is drinking again . Sure . But do n't you get on that wheel now . Was n't Grant supposed to be drunk a good part of the time during the Civil War ? Certainly he was . I 'll bet Grant would be furious at the comparison if he could see Pablo . Grant was a cigar smoker , too . Well , he would have to see about getting Pablo a cigar . That was what that face really needed to complete it ; a half chewed cigar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does it go ? " Robert Jordan asked politely . " Very well , " Pablo said and nodded his head heavily and judiciously . " Muy bien . " " You 've thought up something ? " Agustin asked from where they were playing cards . " Yes , " Pablo said . " Various things . " " Where did you find them ? In that bowl ? " Agustin demanded . " Perhaps , " Pablo said . " Who knows ? Maria , fill the bowl , will you , please ? " " In the wineskin itself there should be some fine ideas , " Agustinturned back to the card game . " Why do n't you crawl in and look for them inside the skin ? " " Nay , " said Pablo equably . " I search for them in the bowl . " He is not getting on the wheel either , Robert Jordan thought . It must be revolving by itself . I suppose you can not ride that wheel too long . That is probably quite a deadly wheel . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making me dizzy there a couple of times . But it is the thing that drunkards and those who are truly mean of cruel ride until they die . It goes around and up and the swing is never quite the same and then it comes around down . Let it swing , he thought . They will not get me onto it again . No sir , General Grant , I am off that wheel . Pilar was sitting by the fire , her chair turned so that she could see over the shoulders of the two card players who had their backs to her . She was watching the game . Here it is the shift from deadliness to normal family life that is the strangest , Robert Jordan thought . It is when the damned wheel comes down that it gets you . But I am off that wheel , he thought . And nobody is going to get me onto it again . Two days ago I never knew that Pilar , Pablo nor the rest existed , he thought . There was no such thing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simpler world . I had instructions from Golz that were perfectly clear and seemed perfectly possible to carry out although they presented certain difficulties and involved certain consequences . After we blew the bridge I expected either to get back to the lines or not get back and if we got back I was going to ask for some time in Madrid . No one has any leave in this war but I am sure I could get two or three days in Madrid . In Madrid I wanted to buy some books , to go to the Florida Hotel and get a room and to have a hot bath , he thought . I was going to send Luis the porter out for a bottle of absinthe if he could locateone at the Mantequerias Leonesas or at any of the places off the Gran Via and I was going to lie in bed and read after the bath and drink a couple of absinthes and then I was going to call up Gaylord 's and see if I could come up there and eat . He did not want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good really and you had to get there on time or whatever there was of it would be gone . Also there were too many newspaper men there he knew and he did not want to have to keep his mouth shut . He wanted to drink the absinthes and to feel like talking and then go up to Gaylord 's and eat with Karkov , where they had good food and real beer , and find out what was going on in the war . He had not liked Gaylord 's , the hotel in Madrid the Russians had taken over , when he first went there because it seemed too luxurious and the food was too good for a besieged city and the talk too cynical for a war . But I corrupted very easily , he thought . Why should you not have as good food as could be organizedwhen you came back from something like this ? And the talk that he had thought of as cynicism when he had first heard it had turned out to be much too true . This will be something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is over . Yes , when this is over . Could you take Maria to Gaylord 's ? No . You could n't . But you could leave her in the hotel and she could take a hot bath and bep229there when you came back from Gaylord 's . Yes , you could do that and after you had told Karkov about her , you could bring her later because they would be curious about her and want to see her . Maybe you would n't go to Gaylord 's at all . You could eat early at the Gran Via and hurry back to the Florida . But you knew you would go to Gaylord 's because you wanted to see all that again ; you wanted to eat that food again and you wanted to see all the comfort of it and the luxury of it after this . Then you would come back to the Florida and there Maria would be . Sure , she would be there after this was over . After this was over . Yes , after this was over . If he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gaylord 's was the place where you met famous peasant and worker Spanish commanders who had sprung to arms from the people at the start of the war without any previous military trainingand found that many of them spoke Russian . That had been the first big disillusion to him a few months back and he had started to be cynical to himself about it . But when he realized how it happened it was all right . They were peasants and workers . They had been active in the 1934 revolution and had to flee the country when it failed and in Russia they had sent them to the military academy and to the Lenin Institute the Comintern maintained so they would be ready to fight the next time and have the necessary military education to command . The Comintern had educated them there . In a revolution you could not admit to outsiders who helped you nor that any one knew more than he was supposed to know . He had learned that . If a thing was right fundamentally the lying was not supposed to matter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not care for the lying at first . He hated it . Then later he had come to like it . It was part of being an insider but it was a very corrupting business . It was at Gaylord 's that you learned that Valentin Gonzalez , called El Campesino or The Peasant , had never been a peasant but was an ex-sergeant in the Spanish Foreign Legion who had deserted and fought with Abd el Krim . That was all right , too . Why should n't he be ? You had to have these peasant leaders quickly in this sort of war and a real peasant leader might be a little too much like Pablo . You could n't wait for the real Peasant Leader to arrive and he might have too many peasant characteristics when he did . So you had to manufacture one . At that , from what he had seen of Campesino , with his black beard , his thick negroid lips , and his feverish , staring eyes , he thought he might give almost as much trouble as a real peasant leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have gotten to believe his own publicity and think he was a peasant . He was a brave , tough man ; no braver in the world . But God , how he talked too much . And when he was excited he would say anything no matter what the consequences of his indiscretion . And those consequences had been many already . He was a wonderful Brigade Commander though in a situation where it looked as though everything was lost . He never knew when everything was lost and if it was , he would fight out of it . At Gaylord 's , too , you met the simple stonemason , Enrique Listerfrom Galicia , who now commanded a division and who talked Russian , too . And you met the cabinet worker , Juan Modesto from Andalucia who had just been given an Army Corps . He never learned his Russian in Puerto de Santa Maria although he might have if they had a Berlitz School there that the cabinet makers went to . He was the most trusted of the young soldiers by the Russians because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent " they said , proud to use the Americanism . He was much more intelligent than Lister or El Campesino . Sure , Gaylord 's was the place you . needed to complete your education . It was there you learned how it was all really done insteadof how it was supposed to be done . He had only started his education , he thought . He wondered whether he would continuewith it long . Gaylord 's was good and sound and what he needed . At the start when he had still believed all the nonsense it had come as a shock to him . But now he knew enough to accept the necessity for all the deception and what he learned at Gaylord 's only strengthened him in his belief in the things that he did hold to be true . He liked to know how it really was ; not how it was supposed to be . There was always lying in a war . But the truth of Lister , Modesto , and El Campesino was much better than the lies and legends . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and meantime he was glad there was a Gaylord 's for his own learning of it . Yes , that was where he would go in Madrid after he had boughtp231the books and after he had lain in the hot bath and had a couple of drinks and had read awhile . But that was before Maria had come into all this that he had that plan . All right . They would have two rooms and she could do what she liked while he went up there and he 'd come back from Gaylord 's to her . She had waited up in the hills all this time . She could wait a little while at the Hotel Florida . They would have three days in Madrid . Three days could be a long time . He 'd take her to see the Marx Brothers at the Opera . That had been running for three months now and would certainly be good for three months more . She 'd like the Marx Brothers at the Opera , he thought . She 'd like that very much . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , that was not the long way . The long way was going to be from this cave to Gaylord 's . Kashkin had taken him there first and he had not liked it . Kashkin had said he should meet Karkov because Karkov wanted to know Americans and because he was the greatestlover of Lope de Vega in the world and thought " Fuente Ovejuna " was the greatest play ever written . Maybe it was at that , but he , Robert Jordan , did not think so . He had liked Karkov but not the place . Karkov was the most intelligent man he had ever met . Wearing black riding boots , gray breeches , and a gray tunic , with tiny hands and feet , puffily fragile of face and body , with a spitting way of talking through his bad teeth , he looked comic when Robert Jordan first saw him . But he had more brains and more inner dignity and outer insolence and humor than any man that he had ever known . Gaylord 's itself had seemed indecently luxurious and corrupt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governed a sixth of the world have a few comforts ? Well , they had them and RobertJordan had at first been repelled by the whole business and then had accepted it and enjoyed it . Kashkin had made him out to be a hell of a fellow and Karkov had at first been insultingly polite and then , when Robert Jordan had not played at being a hero but had told a story that was really funny and obscenely discreditableto himself , Karkov had shifted from the politeness to a relieved rudeness and then to insolence and they had become friends . Kashkin had only been tolerated there . There was something wrong with Kashkin evidently and he was working it out in Spain . They would not tell him what it was but maybe they would now that he was dead . Anyway , he and Karkov had becomefriends and he had become friends too with the incredibly thin , drawn , dark , loving , nervous , deprived and unbitter woman with a lean , neglected body and dark , gray-streaked hair cut short who was Karkov 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corps . He was a friend too of Karkov 's mistress , who had cat-eyes , reddish gold hair ( sometimes more red ; sometimes more gold , depending on the coiffeurs ) , a lazy sensual body ( made to fit well against other bodies ) , a mouth made to fit other mouths , and a stupid , ambitious and utterly loyal mind . This mistress loved . gossip and enjoyed a periodically controlled promiscuity which seemed only to amuse Karkov . Karkov was supposed to have anotherwife somewhere beside the tank-corps one , maybe two more , but nobody was very sure about that . Robert Jordan liked both the wife he knew and the mistress . He thought he would probably like the other wife , too , if he knew her , if there was one . Karkov had good taste in women . There were sentries with bayonets downstairs outside the portecochereat Gaylord 's and tonight it would be the pleasantest and most comfortable place in all of besieged Madrid . He would like to be there tonight instead of here . Though it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the snow was stopping too . He would like to show his Maria to Karkov but he could not take her there unless he asked first and he would have to see how he was received after this trip . Golz would be there after this attack was over and if he had done well they would all know it from Golz . Golz would make fun of him , too , about Maria . After what he 'd said to him about no girls . He reached over to the bowl in front of Pablo and dipped up a cup of wine . " With your permission , " he said . Pablo nodded . He is engaged in his military studies , I imagine , Robert Jordan thought . Not seeking the bubble reputation in the cannon 's mouth but seeking the solution to the problem in yonder bowl . But you know the bastard must be fairly able to have run this band successfully for as long as he did . Looking at Pablo he wondered what sort of guerilla leader he would have been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought . But we know very little about them . Not the Quantrills , nor the Mosbys , nor his own grandfather , but the littles ones , the bushwhackers . And about the drinking . Do you suppose Grant really was a drunk ? His grandfather always claimed he was . That he was always a little drunk by four o'clock in the afternoon and that beforeVicksburg sometimes during the siege he was very drunk for a couple of days . But grandfather claimed that he functioned perfectlynormally no matter how much he drank except that sometimes it was very hard to wake him . But if you could wake him he was normal . There was n't any Grant , nor any Sherman nor any Stonewall Jackson on either side so far in this war . No . Nor any Jeb Stuart either . Nor any Sheridan . It was overrun with McClellans though , The fascists had plenty of McClellans and we had at least three of them . He had certainly not seen any military geniuses in this war . Not a one . Nor anything resembling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine job of their share in the defense of Madrid with the International Brigades and then the old bald , spectacled , conceited , stupid-as-an-owl , **29;6051;TOOLONG , **26;6082;TOOLONG , propaganda-built-up defender of Madrid , Miaja , had been so jealous of the publicity Kleber received that he had forced the Russians to relieve Kleber of his command and send him to Valencia . Kleber was a good soldier ; but limited and he did talk too much for the job he had . Golz was a good general and a fine soldier but they always kept him in a subordinate positionand never gave him a free hand . This attack was going to be his biggest show so far and Robert Jordan did not like too much what he had heard about the attack . Then there was Gall , the Hungarian , who ought to be shot if you could believe half you heard at Gaylord 's . Make it if you can believe ten per cent of what you hear at Gaylord 's , Robert Jordan thought . He wished that he had seen the fighting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he had been down in Estremadura then . Hans had told him about it one night in Gaylord 's two weeks ago and made him see it all . There was one moment when it was really lost when the Italians had broken the line near Trijueque and the Twelfth Brigade would have been cut off if the Torija-Brihuega road had been cut . " But knowing they were Italians , " Hans had said , " we attempted a manoeuvre which would have been unjustifiable against other troops . And it was successful . " Hans had shown it all to him on his maps of the battle . Hans carried them around with him in his map case all the time and still seemed marvelled and happy at the miracle of it . Hans was a fine soldier and a good companion . Lister 's and Modesto 's and Campesino 's Spanish troops had all fought well in that battle , Hans had told him , and that was to be credited to their leaders and to the discipline they enforced . But Lister and Campesino and Modesto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their Russian military advisers . They were like students flying a machine with dual controls which the pilot could take over whenever they made a mistake . Well , this year would show how much and how well they learned . After a while there would not be dual controls and then we would see how well they handled divisions and army corps alone . They were Communists and they were disciplinarians . The disciplinethat they would enforce would make good troops . Lister was murderous in discipline . He was a true fanatic and he had the complete Spanish lack of respect for life . In few armies since the Tartar 's first invasion of the West were men executed summarily for as little reason as they were under his command . But he knew how to forge a division into a fighting unit . It is one thing to hold positions . It is another to attack positions and take them and it is something very different to manoeuvre an army in the field , Robert Jordan thought as he sat there at the table . From what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be at that once the dual controls are gone ? But maybe they wo n't go , he thought . I wonder if they will go ? Or whether they will strengthen ? I wonder what the Russian stand is on the whole business ? Gaylord 's is the place , he thought . There is much that I need to know now that I can learn only at Gaylord 's . At one time he had thought Gaylord 's had been bad for him . It was the opposite of the puritanical , religious communism of Velazquez 63 , the Madrid palace that had been turned into thep235International Brigade headquarters in the capital . At Velazquez 63 it was like being a member of a religious order  --  and Gaylord 's was a long way away from the feeling you had at the headquarters of the Fifth Regiment before it had been broken up into the brigadesof the new army . At either of those places you felt that you were taking part in a crusade . That was the only word for it although it was a word that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave its true meaning . You felt , in spite of all bureaucracy and inefficiency and party strife something that was like the feeling you expected to have and did not have when you made your first communion . It was a feeling of consecration to a duty toward all of the oppressed of the world which would be as difficult and embarrassing to speak about as religious experience and yet it was authentic as the feeling you had when you heard Bach , or stood in Chartres Cathedral or the Cathedral at Leon and saw the light coming through the great windows ; or when you saw Mantegna and Greco and Brueghel in the Prado . It gave you a part in something that you could believe in wholly and completely and in which you felt an absolute brotherhood with the others who were engaged in it . It was something that you had never known before but that you had experienced now and you gave such importance to it and the reasons for it that your own death seemed of complete unimportance ; only a thing to be avoided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the best thing was that there was something you could do about this feeling and this necessity too . You could fight . So you fought , he thought . And in the fighting soon there was no purity of feeling for those who survived the fighting and were good at it . Not after the first six months . The defense of a position or of a city is a part of war in which you can feel that first sort of feeling . The fighting in the Sierras had been that way . They had fought there with the true comradeship of the revolution . Up there when there had been the first necessity for the enforcement of discipline he had approved and understood it Under the shelling men had been cowards and had run . He had seen them shot and left to swell beside the road , nobody bothering to do more than strip them of their cartridges and their valuables.  | Taking their cartridges , their boots and their leather coats was right . Taking the valuables was only realistic . It only kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and right and necessary that the men who ran were shot . There was nothing wrong about it . Their running was a selfishness . The fascists had attacked and we had stopped them on that slope in the gray rocks , the scrub pines and the gorse of the Guadarrama hillsides . We had held along the road under the bombing from the planes and the shelling when they brought their artillery up and those who were left at the end of that day had counterattacked and driven them back . Later , when they had tried to come down on the left , sifting down between the rocks and through the trees , we had held out in the Sanitarium firing from the windows and the roof although they had passed it on both sides , and we lived through knowing what it was to be surroundeduntil the counterattack had cleared them back behind the road again . In all that , in the fear that dries your mouth and your throat , in the smashed plaster dust and the sudden panic of a wall falling , collapsing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun , dragging those away who had been serving it , lying face downward and covered with rubble , your head behind the shield working on a stoppage , getting the broken case out , straighteningthe belt again , you now lying straight behind the shield , the gun searching the roadside again ; you did the thing there was to do and knew that you were right . You learned the dry-mouthed , fear-purged , purging ecstasy of battle and you fought that summer and that fall for all the poor in the world , against all tyranny , for all the things that you believed and for the new world you had been educated into . You learned that fall , he thought , how to endureand how to ignore suffering in the long time of cold and wetness , of mud and of digging and fortifying . And the feeling of the summer and the fall was buried deep under tiredness , sleepiness , and nervousness and discomfort . But it was still there and all that you went through only served to validate it . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deep and sound and selfless pride  --  that would have made you a bloody bore at Gaylord 's , he thought suddenly  |p237No  , you would not have been so good at Gaylord 's then , he thought . You were too naive . You were in a sort of state of grace . But Gaylord 's might not have been the way it was now at that time , either . No , as a matter of fact , it was not that way , he told himself . It was not that way at all . There was not any Gaylord 's then . Karkov had told him about those days . At that time what Russiansthere were had lived at the Palace Hotel . Robert Jordan had known none of them then . That was before the first partizan groups had been formed ; before he had met Kashkin or any of the others . Kashkin had been in the north at Irun , at San Sebastian and in the abortive fighting toward Vitoria . He had not arrived in Madrid until January and while Robert Jordan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days when they stopped the right wing of the fascist attack on Madrid and drove the Moors and the Tercio back from house to house to clear that batteredsuburb on the edge of the gray , sun-baked plateau and establish a line of defense along the heights that would protect that corner of the city , Karkov had been in Madrid . Karkov was not cynical about those times either when he talked . Those were the days they all shared when everything looked lost and each man retained now , better than any citation or decoration , the knowledge of just how he would act when everything looked lost . The government had abandoned the city , taking all the motor cars from the ministry of war in their flight and old Miaja had to ride down to inspect his defensive positions on a bicycle . Robert Jordan did not believe that one . He could not see Miaja on a bicycle even in his most patriotic imagination , but Karkov said it was true . But then he had written it for Russian papers so he probably wanted to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another story that Karkov had not written . He had three wounded Russians in the Palace Hotel for whom he was responsible . They were two tank drivers and a flyer who were too bad to be moved , and since , at that time , it was of the greatest importance that there should be no evidence of any Russian interventionto justify an open intervention by the fascists , it was Karkov 's responsibility that these wounded should not fall into the bands of the fascists in case the city should be abandoned.  | In the event the city should be abandoned , Karkov was to poison them to destroy all evidence of their identity before leaving the Palace Hotel . No one could prove from the bodies of three wounded men , one with three bullet wounds in his abdomen , one with his jaw shot away and his vocal cords exposed , one with his femur smashed to bits by a bullet and his hands and face so badly burned that his face was just an eyelashless , eyebrowless , hairless blister that they were Russians . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would leave in beds at the Palace , that they were Russians . Nothing proved a naked dead man was a Russian . Ycur nationality and your politics did not show when you were dead . Robert Jordan had asked Karkov how he felt about the necessity of performing this act and Karkov had said that he had not looked forward to it . " How were you going to do it ? " Robert Jordan had asked him and had added , " You know it is n't so simple just suddenly to poison people . " And Karkov had said , " Oh , yes , it is when you carry it always for your own use . " Then he had opened his cigarette case and showed Robert Jordan what he carried in one side of it . " But the first thing anybody would do if they took you prisoner would be to take your cigarette case , " Robert Jordan had objected . " They would have your hands un . " " But I have a little more here , " Karkov had grinned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put the lapel in your mouth like this and bite it and swallow . " " That 's much better , " Robert Jordan had said . " Tell me , does it smell like bitter almonds the way it always does in detective stories ? " " I do n't know , " Karkov said delightedly . " I have never smelled it . Should we break a little tube and smell it ? " " Better keep it . " " Yes , " Karkov said and put the cigarette case away . " I am not a defeatist , you understand , but it is always possible that such serious times might come again and you can not get this anywhere . Have you seen the communique from the Cordoba front ? It is very beautiful . It is now my favorite among all the communiques . " " What did it say ? " Robert Jordan had come to Madrid from the Cordoban Front and he had the sudden stiffening that comes wherep239some one jokes about a thing which you yourself may joke about but which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloriosa tropa siga avanzando sin perder ni una sola palma de terreno , " Karkov said in his strange Spanish . " It did n't really say that , " Robert Jordan doubted . " Our glorious troops continue to advance without losing a foot of ground , " Karkov repeated in English . " It is in the communique . I will find it for you . " You could remember the men you knew who died in the fighting around Pozoblanco ; but it was a joke at Gaylord 's . So that was the way it was at Gaylord 's now . Still there had not always been Gaylord 's and if the situation was now one which produced such a thing as Gaylord 's out of the survivors of the early days , he was glad to see Gaylord 's and to know about it . You are a long way from how you felt in the Sierra and at Carabanchel and at Usera , he thought . You corrupt very easily , he thought . But was it corruption or was it merely that you lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the same in anything ? Who else kept that first chastity of mind about their work that young doctors , young priests , and young soldiers usually started with ? The priests certainly kept it , or they got out . I suppose the Nazis keep it , he thought , and the Communists who have a severe enough self-discipline . But look at Karkov . He never tired of considering the case of Karkov . The last time he had been at Gaylord 's Karkov had been wonderful about a certainBritish economist who had spent much time in Spain . RobertJordan had read this man 's writing for years and he had always respected him without knowing anything about him . He had not cared very much for what this man had written about Spain . It was too clear and simple and too open and shut and many of the statistics he knew were faked by wishful thinking . But he thought you rarely cared for journalism written about a country you really knew about and he respected the man for his intentions . Then he had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had attacked at Carabanchel . They were sitting in the lee of the bull ring and there was shooting down the two streets and every one was nervous waiting for the attack . A tank had been promised and it had not come up and Montero was sitting with his head in his hand saying , " The tank has not come . The tank has not come . " It was a cold day and the yellow dust was blowing down the street and Montero had been hit in the left arm and the arm was stiffening . " We have to have a tank , " he said . " We must wait for the tank , but we can not wait . " His wound was making him sound petulant . Robert Jordan had gone back to look for the tank which Montero said he thought might have stopped behind the apartment building on the corner of the tram-line . It was there all right . But it was not a tank . Spaniards called anything a tank in those days . It was an old armoured car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the apartment house and bring it up to the bull ring . He was standingbehind it with his arms folded against the metal of the car and his head in the leather-padded helmet on his arms . He shook his head when Robert Jordan spoke to him and kept it pressed against his arms . Then he turned his head without looking at Robert Jordan . " I have no orders to go there , " he said sullenly . Robert Jordan had taken his pistol out of the holster and pushed the muzzle of the pistol against the leather coat of the armoured car driver . " Here are your orders , " he had told him . The man shook his head with the big-padded-leather helmet like a football player 's on it and said , " There is no ammunition for the machine-gun . " " We have ammunition at the bull ring , " Robert Jordan had told him . " Come on , let 's go . We will fill the belts there . Come on . " " There is no one to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is he ? Where is your mate ? " " Dead , " the driver had said . " Inside there . " " Get him out , " Robert Jordan had said . " Get him out of there . " " I do not like to touch him , " the driver had said . " And he is bent over between the gun and the wheel and I can not get past him . " " Come on , " Robert Jordan had said . " We will get him out together . " He had banged his head as he climbed into the armoured car and it had made a small cut over his eyebrow that bled down onto his face . The dead man was heavy and so stiff you could not bend him and he had to hammer at his head to get it out from where it hadp24Iwedged , face-down , between his seat and the wheel . Finally he got it up by pushing with his knee up under the dead man 's head and then , pulling back on the man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead man out himself toward the door . " Give me a hand with him , " he had said to the driver . " I do not want to touch him , " the driver had said and Robert Jordan had seen that he was crying . The tears ran straight down on each side of his nose on the powder-grimed slope of his face and his nose was running , too . Standing beside the door he had swung the dead man out and the dead man fell onto the sidewalk beside the tram-line still in that hunched-over , doubled-up position . He lay there , his face waxy gray against the cement sidewalk , his hands bent under him as they had been in the car . " Get in , God damn it , " Robert Jordan had said , motioning now with his pistol to the driver . " Get in there now . " Just then he had seen this man who had come out from the lee of the apartment house building . He had on a long overcoat and he was bareheaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes were deep and set close together . He had a package of Chesterfields in his hand and he took one out and handed it toward Robert Jordan who was pushing the driver into the armoured car with his pistol . " Just a minute , Comrade , " he had said to Robert Jordan in Spanish . " Can you explain to me something about the fighting ? " Robert Jordan took the cigarette and put it in the breast pocket of his blue mechanic jumper . He had recognized this comrade from his pictures . It was the British economist . " Go muck yourself , " he said in English and then , in Spanish , to the armoured car driver . " Down there . The bull ring . See ? " And he had pulled the heavy side door to with a slam and locked it and they had started down that long slope in the car and the bulletshad commenced to hit against the car , sounding like pebbles tossed against an iron boiler , Then when the machine-gun opened on them , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the shelter of the bull ring with the last October posters still pasted up beside the ticket window and the ammunition boxes knocked open and the comrades with the rifles , the grenades on theirA belts and in their pockets , waiting there in the lee and Montero had said , " Good . Here is the tank . Now we can attack . " Later that night when they had the last houses on the hill , he lay comfortable behind a brick wall with a hole knocked in the bricks for a loophole and looked across the beautiful level field of fire they had between them and the ridge the fascists had retired to and thought , with a comfort that was almost voluptuous , of the rise of the hill with the smashed villa that protected the left flank . He had lain in a pile of straw in his sweat-soaked clothes and wound a blanket around him while he dried . Lying there he thought of the economist and laughed , and then felt sorry he had been rude . But at the moment , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out almost like offering a tip for information , the combatant 's hatred for the noncombatant had been too much for him . Now he remembered Gaylord 's and Karkov speaking of this same man . " So it was there you met him , " Karkov had said . " I did not get farther than the Puente de Toledo myself on that day . He was very far toward the front . That was the last day of his bravery I believe . He left Madrid the next day . Toledo was where he was the bravest , I believe . At Toledo he was enormous . He was one of the architects of our capture of the Alcazar . You should have seen him at Toledo . I believe it was largely through his efforts and his advice that our siege was successful . That was the silliest part of the war . It reached an ultimate in silliness but tell me , what is thought of him in America ? " " In America , " Robert Jordan said , " he is supposed to be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Karkov . " But he has a wonderful face and his face and his manners are very successful . Now with my face I could do nothing . What little I have accomplished was all done in spite of my face which does not either inspire people nor move them to love me and to trust me . But this man Mitchell has a face he makes his fortune with . It is the face of a conspirator . All who have read of conspirators in books trust him instantly . Also he has the true manner of the conspirator . Any one seeing him enter a room Knows that he is instantly in the presence of a conspirator of the first mark . All of your rich compatriots who wish sentimentally top243aid the Soviet Union as they believe or to insure themselves a little against any eventual success of the party see instantly in the face of this man , and in his manner that he can be none other than a trusted agent of the Comintern . " " Has he no connections in Moscow ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know about the two kinds of fools ? " " Plain and damn ? " " No . The two kinds of fools we have in Russia , " Karkov grinned and began . " First there is the winter fool . The winter fool comes to the door of your house and he knocks loudly . You go to the door and you see him there and you have never seen him before . He is an impressive sight . He is a very big man and he has on high boots and a fur coat and a fur hat and he is all covered with snow . First he stamps his boots and snow falls from them . Then he takes off his fur coat and shakes it and more snow falls . Then he takes off his fur hat and knocks it against the door . More snow falls from his fur hat . Then he stamps his boots again and advances into the room . Then you look at him and you see he is a fool . That is the winter fool . " Now in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he is waving his arms and jerking his head from side to side and everybody from two hundred yards away can tell he is a fool . That is a summer fool . This economist is a winter fool . " " But why do people trust him here ? " Robert Jordan asked . " His face , " Karkov said . " His beautiful gueule de conspirateur . And his invaluable trick of just having come from somewhere else where he is very trusted and important . Of course , " he smiled , " he must travel very much to keep the trick working . You know the Spanish are very strange , " Karkov went on . " This government has had much money . Much gold . They will give nothing to their friends . You are a friend . All right . You will do it for nothing and should not be rewarded . But to people representing an important firm or a country which is not friendly but must be influenced  --  to such people they give much . It is very interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it . Also that money belongs to the Spanish workers . "  | " You are not supposed to like things . Only to understand , " Karkov had told him . " I teach you a little each time I see you and eventually you will acquire an education . It would be very interestingfor a professor to be educated . " " I do n't know whether I 'll be able to be a professor when I get back . They will probably run me out as a red . " " Well , perhaps you will be able to come to the Soviet Union and continue your studies there . That might be the best thing for you to do . " " But Spanish is my field . " " There are many countries where Spanish is spoken , " Karkov had said . " They can not all be as difficult to do anything with as Spain is . Then you must remember that you have not been a professor now for almost nine months . In nine months you may have learned a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have read the Handbook of Marxism that Emil Burns edited . That is all . " " If you have read it all that is quite a little . There are fifteen hundred pages and you could spend some time on each page . But there are some other things you should read . " " There is no time to read now . " " I know , " Karkov had said . " I mean eventually . There are many things to read which will make you understand some of these things that happen . But out of this will come a book which is very necessary ; which will explain many things which it is necessary to know . Perhaps I will write it . I hope that it will be me who will write it . " " I do n't know who could write it better . " " Do not flatter , " Karkov had said . " I am a journalist . But like all journalists I wish to write literature . Just now , I am very busy on a study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a true Spanish fascist . Franco and these other people are not . I have been studying all of Sotelo 's writings and speeches . He was very intelligent and it was very intelligent that he was killed . " " I thought that you did not believe in political assassination . " " It is practised very extensively , " Karkov said " Very , very exten-sively . " " But  --  "  | " We do not believe in acts of terrorism by individuals , " Karkov had smiled . " Not of course by criminal terrorist and **33;6110;TOOLONG . We detest with horror the duplicity and villainy of the murderous hyenas of Bukharinite wreckers and such dregs of humanity as Zinoviev , Kamenev , Rykov and their henchmen . We hate and loathe these veritable fiends , " he smiled again . " But I still believe that political assassination can be said to be practised very extensively . " " You mean " " I mean nothing . But certainly we execute and destroy such veritable fiends and dregs of humanity and the treacherous dogs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust . These are destroyed . They are not assassinated . Yousee the difference ? " " I see , " Robert Jordan had said . " And because I make jokes sometime : and you know how dangerous it is to make jokes even in joke ? Good . Because I make jokes , do not think that the Spanish people will not live to regret that they have not shot certain generals that even now hold commands . I do not like the shootings , you understand . " " I do n't mind them , " Robert Jordan said . " I do not like them but I do not mind them any more . " " I know that , " Karkov had said . " I have been told that . " " Is it important ? " Robert Jordan said . " I was only trying to be truthful about it . " " It is regretful , " Karkov had said . " But it is one of the things that makes people be treated as reliable who would ordinarily have to spend much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I supposed to be reliable ? " " In your work you are supposed to be very reliable . I must talk to you sometime to see how you are in your mind . It is regretablethat we never speak seriously . " " My mind is in suspension until we win the war , " Robert Jordan had said . " Then perhaps you will not need it for a long time . But you should be careful to exercise it a little . " " I read Mundo Obrero , " Robert Jordan had told him and Karkov had said , " All right . Good . I can take a joke too . But there are very intelligent things in Mundo Obrero . The only intelligentthings written on this war . " " Yes , " Robert Jordan had said . " I agree with you . But to get a full picture of what is happening you can not read only the party organ . " " No , " Karkov had said . " But you will not find any such picture if you read twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not know whet you would do with it . I have such a picture almost constantlyand what I do is try to forget it . " " You think it is that bad ? " " It is better now than it was . We are getting rid of some of the worst . But it is very rotten . We are building a huge army now and some of the elements , those of Modesto , of El Campesino , of Lister and of Duran , are reliable . They are more than reliable . They are magnificent . You will see that . Also we still have the Brigades although their role is changing . But an army that is made up of good and bad elements can not win a war . All must be brought to a certain level of political development ; all must know why they are fighting , and its importance . All must believe in the fight they are to make and all must accept discipline . We are making a huge conscript army without the time to implant the discipline that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire . We call it a people 's army but it will not have the assets of a true people 's army and it will not have the iron discipline that a conscript army needs . You will see . It is a very dangerous procedure . " " You are not very cheerful today . " " No , " Karkov had said . " I have just come back from Valencia where I have seen many people . No one comes back very cheerful from Valencia . In Madrid you feel good and clean and with no possibility of anything but winning . Valencia is something else . The cowards who fled from Madrid still govern there . They have settled happily into the sloth and bureaucracy of governing . They have only contempt for those of Madrid . Their obsession now is the weakening of the commissariat for war . And Barcelona . You should see Barcelona . " " How is it ? " " It is all still comic opera . First it was the paradise of the crack/pots and the romantic revolutionists . Now it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who like to wear uniforms , who like to strut and swagger and wear red-and-black scarves . Who like everything about war except to fight . Valencia makes you sick and Barcelona makes you laugh . " " What about the P. O. U. M. putsch ? " " The P. O. U. M. was never serious . It was a heresy of crackpotsand wild men and it was really just an infantilism . There were some honest misguided people . There was one fairly good brain and there was a little fascist money . Not much . The poor P. O. U. M. They were very silly people . " " But were many killed in the putsch ? " " Not so many as were shot afterwards or will be shot . The P. O. U. M. It is like the name . Not serious . They should have called it the M. U. M. P. S. or the M. E. A. S. L. E. S. But no . The Measles is much more dangerous . It can affect both sight and hearing . But they made one plot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kill Modesto and to kill Prieto . You see how badly mixed up they were ? We.are not at all alike . Poor P. O. U. M. They never did kill anybody . Not at the front nor anywhere else . A few in Barcelona , yes . " " Were you there ? " " Yes . I have sent a cable describing the wickedness of that infamous organization of Trotskyite murderers and their fascist machinations all beneath contempt but , between us , it is not very serious , the P. O. U. M. Nin was their only man . We had him but he escaped from our hands . " " Where is he now ? " " In Paris . We say he is in Paris . He was a very pleasant fellow but with bad political aberrations . " " But they were in communication with the fascists , were n't they ? " " Who is not ? " " We are not . " " Who knows ? I hope we are not . You go often behind their lines , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretaries of the Republican Embassy at Paris made a trip to St. Jean de Luz last week to meet people from Burgos. "  | " I like it better at the front , " Robert Jordan had said . " The closer to the front the better the people . " " How do you like it behind the fascist lines ? " " Very much . We have fine people there . " " Well , you see they must have their fine people behind out lines the same way . We find them and shoot them and they find ours and shoot them . When you are in their country you must always think of how many people they must send over to us . " " I have thought about them . " " Well , " Karkov had said . " You have probably enough to think about for today , so drink that beer that is left in the pitcher and run along now because I have to go upstairs to see people . Upstairspeople . Come again to see me soon . " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . Karkov had read the one and only book he had published . The book had not been a success . It was only two hundred pages long and he doubted if two thousand people had ever read it . He had put in it what he had discovered about Spain in ten years of travelling in it , on foot , in third-class carriages , by bus , on horseandmule-back and in trucks . He knew the Basque country , Navarre , Aragon , Galicia , the two Castiles and Estremadura well . There had been such good books written by Borrow and Ford and the rest that he had been able to add very little . But Karkov said it was a good book . " It is why I bother with you , " he had said . " I think you write absolutely truly and that is very rare . So I would like you to know some things . " All right . He would write a book when he got through with this . But only about the things he knew , truly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a much better writer than I am now to handle them , he thought . The things he had come to know in this war were not so simple.  | " WHAT do you do sitting there ? " Maria asked him . She was standing close beside him and he turned his head and smiled at her . " Nothing , , " he said . " I have been thinking . " " What of ? The bridge ? " " No . The bridge is terminated . Of thee and of a hotel in Madrid where I know some Russians , and of a book I will write some time . " " Are there many Russians in Madrid ? " " No . Very few . " " But in the fascist periodicals it says there are hundreds of thousands . " " Those are lies . There are very few . " " Do you like the Russians ? The one who was here was a Russian . " " Did you like him ? " " Yes . I was sick then but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What nonsense , beautiful , " Pilar said . " His nose was flat as my hand and he had cheekbones as wide as a sheep 's buttocks . " " He was a good friend and comrade of mine , " Robert Jordan said to Maria . " I cared for him very much . " " Sure , " Pilar said . " But you shot him . " When she said this the card players looked up from the table and Pablo stared at Robert Jordan . Nobody said anything and then the gypsy , Rafael , asked , " Is it true , Roberto ? " " Yes , " Robert Jordan said . He wished Pilar had not brought this up and he wished he had not told it at El Sordo 's . " At his request . He was badly wounded . " " Que Cosa mas rara , " the gypsy said . " All the time he was with us he talked of such a possibility . I do n't know how many times I have promised him to perform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said again and shook his head.  | " He was a very rare man , " Primitivo said . " Very singular . " " Look , " Andres , one of the brothers , said . " You who are Professorand all . Do you believe in the possibility of a man seeing ahead what is to happen to him ? " " I believe he can not see it , " Robert Jordan said . Pablo was staring at him curiously and Pilar was watching him with no expression on her face . " In the case of this Russian comrade he was very nervous from being too much time at the front . He had fought at Irun which , you know , was bad . Very bad . He had fought later in the north . And since the first groups who did this work behind the lines were formed he had worked here , in Extremaduraand in Andalucia . I think he was very tired and nervous and he imagined ugly things . " " He would undoubtedly have seen many evil things , " Fernando said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But listen to me , Ingles . Do you think there is such a thing as a man knowing in advance what will befall him ? " " No , " Robert Jordan said . " That is ignorance and superstition . " " Go on , " Pilar said . " Let us hear the viewpoint of the professor . " She spoke as though she were talking to a precocious child . " I believe that fear produces evil visions , " Robert Jordan said . " Seeing bad signs  --  " " Such as the airplanes today , " Primitivo said . " Such as thy arrival , " Pablo said softly and Robert Jordan looked across the table at him , saw it was not a provocation but only an expressed thought , then went on . " Seeing bad signs , one , with fear , imagines an end for himself and one thinks that imagining comes by divination , " Robert Jordan concluded . " I believe there is nothing more to it than that . I do not believe in ogres , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But this one with the rare name saw his fate clearly , " the gypsy said . " And that was how it happened . " " He did not see it , " Robert Jordan said . " He had a fear of such a possibility and it became an obsession . No one can tell me that he saw anything . " " Not I ? " Pilar asked him and picked some dust up from thep251fire and blew it off the palm of her hand . " I can not tell thee either ? " " No . With all wizardry , gypsy and all , thou canst not tell me either . " " Because thou art a miracle of deafness , " Pilar said , her big face harsh and broad in the candlelight . " It is not that thou art stupid . Thou art simply deaf . One who is deaf can not hear music . Neither can he hear the radio . So he might say , never having heard them , that such things do not exist . Que. va , Ingle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rare name in his face as though it were burned there with a branding iron . " " You did not , " Robert Jordan insisted . " You saw fear and apprehension . The fear was made by what he had been through . The apprehension was for the possibility of evil he imagined . " " Que. va , " Pilar said . " I saw death there as plainly as though it were sitting on his shoulder . And what is more he smelt of death . " " He smelt of death , " Robert Jordan jeered . " Of fear maybe . There is a smell to fear . " " De la nsuerte , " Pilar said . " Listen . When Blanquet , who was the greatest peon de brega who ever lived , worked under the orders of Granero he told me that on the day of Manolo Granero 's death , when they stopped in the chapel on the way to the ring , the odor of death was so strong on Manolo that it almost made ! Banquet sick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dressed at the hotel before setting out for the ring . The odor was not present in the motorcar when they had sat packed tight together riding to the bull ring . Nor was it distinguishable to any one else but Juan Luis de la Rosa in the chapel . Neither Marcial nor Chicuelo smelled it neither then nor when the four of them lined up for the paseo . But Juan Luis was dead white , Blanquet told me , and he , Blanquet , spoke to him saying , Thou also ? ' " ' So that I can not breathe , ' Juan Luis said to him . And from thy matador . ' " Pues nada , ' Blanquet said . There is nothing to do . Let us hope we are mistaken . ' " ' And the others ? ' Juan Luis asked Blanquet . " Nada Blanquet said . Nothing . But this one stinks worse than Jose at Talavera . '  | " And it was on that afternoon that the bull Pocapena of the ranch of Veragua destroyed Manolo Granero against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Plaza de Toros of Madrid . I was there with Finito and I saw it . The horn entirely destroyed the cranium , the head of Manolo being wedged under the estribo at the base of the barrera where the bull had tossed him . " " But did you smell anything ? " Fernando asked . " Nay , " Pilar said . " I was too far away . We were in the seventh row of tendido three . It was thus , being at an angle , that I could see all that happened . But that same night Blanquet who had been under the orders of Joselito when he too was killed told Finito about it at Fornos , and Finito asked Juan Luis de la Rosa and he would say nothing . But he nodded his head that it was true . I was present when this happened . So , Ingles , it may be that thou art deaf to some things as Chicuelo and Marcial Lalanda and all of their banderilleros and picadors and all of the gente of Juan Luis and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Juan Luis and Blanquet were not deaf . Nor am I deaf to such things . " " Why do you say deaf when it is a thing of the nose ? " Fernando asked . Lechel " Pilar said . " Thou shouldst be the professor in place of the Ingles . But I could tell thee of other things , Ingles , and do not doubt what thou simply can not see nor can not hear . Thou canst not hear what a dog hears . Nor canst thou smell what a dog smells . But already thou halt experienced a little of what can happen to man . " Maria put her hand on Robert Jordan 's shoulder and let it rest there and he thought suddenly , let us finish all this nonsense and take advantage of what time we have . But it is too early yet . We have to kill this part of the evening . So he said to Pablo , " Thou , believest thou in this wizardry ? " " I do not know , " Pablo said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing has ever happened to me . But fear , yes certainly . Plenty . But I believe that the Pilar can divine events from the hand . If she does not lie perhaps it is true that she has smelt such a thing . " 1 " Que. va that I should lie , " Pilar said . " This is not a thing of my invention . This man Blanquet was a man of extreme seriousnessand furthermore very devout . He was no gypsy but a bourgeoisfrom Valencia . Hast thou never seen him ? " " Yes , " Robert Jordan said . " I have seen him many times . He was small , gray-faced and no one handled a cape better . He was quick on his feet as a rabbit . " " Exactly , " Pilar said . " He had a gray face from heart trouble and gypsies said that he carried death with him but that he could flick it away with a cape as you might dust a table . Yet he , who was no gypsy , smelled death on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not see how he could smell it above the smell of manzanilla . Blanquet spoke of this afterwards with much diffidencebut those to whom , he spoke said that it was a fantasy and that what he had smelled was the life that Jose led at that time coming out in sweat from his armpits . But then , later , came this of Manolo Granero in which Juan Luis de la Rosa also participated . Clearly Juan Luis was a man of very little honor , but of much sensitiveness in his work and he was also a great layer of women . But Blanquet was serious and very quiet and completely incapable of telling an untruth . And I . tell you that I smelled death on your colleague who was here . " " I do not believe it , " Robert Jordan said . " Also you said that Blanquet smelled this just before the paseo . Just before the bullfightstarted . Now this was a successful action here of you and Kashkin and the train . He was not killed in that . How could you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with it , " Pilar explained . " In the last season of Ignacio Sanchez Mejias he smelled so strongly of death that many refused to sit with him in the cafe . All gypsies knew of this . " " After the death such things are invented , " Robert Jordan argued . " Every one knew that Sanchez Mejias was on the road to a cornada because he had been too long out of training , because his style was heavy and dangerous , and because his strength and the agility in his legs were gone and his reflexes no longer as they had been . " " Certainly , " Pilar told him . " All of that is true . But all the gypsies knew also that he smelled of death and when he would come into the Villa Rosa you would see such people as Ricardo and Felipe Gonzalez leaving by the small door behind the bar . " " They probably owed him money , " Robert Jordan said . " It is possible , " Pilar said . " Very possible . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What she says is true , Ingles , " the gypsy , Rafael , said . " It is a well-known thing among us . " " I believe nothing of it , " Robert Jordan said . " Listen , Ingles , " Anselmo began . " I am against all such wizardry . But this Pilar has the fame of being very advanced in such things . " " But what does it smell like ? " Fernando asked . " What odor has it ? If there be an odor it must be a definite odor . " " You want to know , Fernandito ? " Pilar smiled at him . " You think that you could smell it ? " " If it actually exists why should I not smell it as well as another ? " " Why not ? " Pilar was making fun of him , her big hands folded across her knees . " Hast thou ever been aboard a ship , Fernando ? " " Nay . And I would not wish to . " " Then thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smell that comes when , on a ship , there is a storm and the portholes are closed up . Put your nose against the brass handle of a screwedtightporthole on a rolling ship that is swaying under you so that you are faint and hollow in the stomach and you have a part of that smell . " " It would be impossible for me to recognize because I will go on no ship , " Fernando said . " I have been on ships several times , " Pilar said . " Both to go to Mexico and to Venezuela . " " What 's the rest of it ? " Robert Jordan asked . Pilar looked at him mockingly , remembering now , proudly , her voyages . " All right , Ingle 's . Learn . That 's the thing . Learn . All right . After that of the ship you must go down the hill in Madrid to the Puente de Toledo early in the morning to the matadero and stand there on the wet paving when there is a fog from the Manzanares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink the blood of the beasts that are slaughtered . When such an old woman comes out of the matadero , holding her shawl around her , with her face gray and her eyes hollow , and the whiskers of age on her chin , and on her cheeks , set in the waxen white of her face as the sprouts grow from the seed of a bean , not bristles , but pale sprouts in the death of her face ; put your arms tight around her , Ingles , and hold her to you and kiss her on the mouth and you will know the second part that odor is made of . " " That one has taken my appetite , " the gypsy said . " That of the sprouts was too much . " " Do you want to hear some more ? " Pilar asked Robert Jordan . " Surely , " he said . " If it is necessary for one to learn let us learn . " " That of the sprouts in the face of the old women sickens me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old women , Pilar ? With us it is not so . " " Nay , " Pilar mocked at him . " With us the old woman , whir was so slender in her youth , except of course for the perpetual bulge that is the mark of her husband 's favor , that every gypsy pushes always before her " Do not speak thus , " Rafael said . " It is ignoble . " " So thou art hurt , " Pilar said . " Halt thou ever seen a gitana who was not about to have , or just to have had , a child ? " " Thou . " " Leave it , " Pilar said . " There is no one who can not be hurt . What I was saying is that age brings its own form of ugliness to all . There is no need to detail it . But if the Ingles must learn that odor that he covets to recognize he must go to the matadero early in the morning . " " I will go , " Robert Jordan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they pass without kissing one . I fear the sprouts , too , as Rafael does . " " Kiss one , " Pilar said . " Kiss one , Ingles , for thy knowledge 's sake and then , with this in thy nostrils , walk back up into the city and when thou seest a refuse pail with dead flowers in it plunge thy nose deep into it and inhale so that scent mixes with those thou hast already in thy nasal passages . "  | " Now have I done it , " Robert Jordan said . " What flowers were they ? " " Chrysanthemums . " " Continue , " Robert Jordan said . " I smell them . " " Then , " Pilar went on , " it is important that the day be in autumn with rain , or at least some fog , or early winter even and now thou shouldst continue to walk through the city and down the Calle de Salud smelling what thou wilt smell where they are sweeping out the casas de putas and emptying the slop jars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's labor lost mixed sweetly with soapy water and cigarette butts only faintly reaching thy nostrils , thou shouldst go on to the Jardin Botanico where at night those girls who can no longer work in the houses do their work against the iron gates of the park and the iron picketed fences and upon the sidewalks . It is there in the shadow of the trees against the iron railings that they will perform all that a man wishes ; from the simplest requests at a remuneration of ten centimos up to a peseta for that great act that we are born to and there , on a dead flower bed that has not yet been plucked out and replanted , and so serves to soften the earth that is so much softer than the sidewalk , thou wilt find an abandoned gunny sack with the odor of the wet earth , the dead flowers , and the doings of that night . In this sack will be contained the essence of it all , both the dead earth and the dead stalks of the flowers and their rotted blooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of man . Thou wilt wrap this sack around thy head and try to breathe through it . " " No . " " Yes , " Pilar said . " Thou wilt wrap this sack around thy head and try to breathe and then , if thou hast not lost any of the previousodors , when thou inhalest deeply , thou wilt smell the odor of death-to-come as we know it . " " All right , " Robert Jordan said , " And you say Kashkin smelt like that when he was here ? " " Yes . " " Well , " said Robert Jordan gravely . " If that is true it is a good thing that I shot him . " " Ole , " the gypsy said . The others laughed.  | " Very good , " Primitivo approved . " That should hold her for a while . " " But Pilar , " Fernando said . " Surely you could not expect one of Don Roberto 's education to do such vile things . " " No , " Pilar agreed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , " Pilar agreed . " You would not expect him actually to perform those degradingacts ? " " No , " Pilar said . " Go to bed , will you ? " " But , Pilar  --  " Fernando went on . " Shut up , will you ? " Pilar said to him suddenly and viciously . " Do not make a fool of thyself and I will try not to make a fool of myself talking with people who can not understand what one speaks of . " " I confess I do not understand , " Fernando began . " Do n't confess and do n't try to understand , " Pilar said . " Is it still snowing outside ? " Robert Jordan went to the mouth of the cave , lifted the blanket and looked out . It was clear and cold in the night outside and no snow was falling . He looked through the tree trunks where the whiteness lay and up through the trees to where the sky was now clear . The air came into his lungs sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave plenty of tracks if he has stolen horses tonight , " he thought . He dropped the blanket and came back into the smoky cave . " It is clear , " he said . " The storm is over . " P258Now IN the night he lay and waited for the girl to come to him . There was no wind now and the pines were still in the night . The trunks of the pines projected from the snow that covered all the ground , and he lay in the robe feeling the suppleness of the bed under him that he had made , his legs stretched long against the warmth of the robe , the air sharp and cold on his head and in his nostrils as he breathed . Under his head , as he lay on his side , was the bulge of the trousers and the coat that he had wrapped around his shoes to make a pillow and against his side was the cold metal of the big automatic pistol he had taken from the holster when he undressed and fastened by its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away and settled deeper into the robe as he watched , across the snow , the dark break in the rocks that was the entrance to the cave . The sky was clear and there was enough light reflected from the snow to see the trunks of the trees and the bulk of the rocks where the cave was . Earlier in the evening he had taken the ax and gone outside of the cave and walked through the new snow to the edge of the clearing and cut down a small spruce tree . In the dark he had dragged it , butt first , to the lee of the rock wall . There close to the rock , he had held the tree upright , holding the trunk firm with one hand , and , holding the ax-haft close to the head had lopped off all the boughs until he had a pile of them . Then , leaving the pile of boughs , he had laid the bare pole of the trunk down in the snow and gone into the cave to get a slab of wood he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scraped the ground clear of the snow along the rock wall and then picked up his boughs and shaking them clean of snow laid them in rows , like over-lapping plumes , until he had a bed . He put the pole across the foot of the bough bed to hold the branches in place and pegged it firm with two pointed pieces of wood he split from th ; edge of the slab . P259Then he carried the slab and the ax back into the cave , ducking under the blanket as he came in , and leaned them both against the wall . " What do you do outside ? " Pilar had asked . " I made a bed . " " Do n't cut pieces from my new shelf for thy bed . " " I am sorry . " " It has no importance , " she said . " There are more slabs at the sawmill . What sort of bed bast thou made ? " " As in my country . " " Then sleep well in it , " she had said and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the robe out and replaced those things wrapped in it hack in the pack and carried the robe out , ducking under the blanket again , and spread it over the boughs so that the closed end of the robe was against the pole that was pegged cross-wise at the foot of the bed . The open head of the robe was protected by the rock wall of the cliff . Then he went back into the cave for his packs but Pilar said , " They can sleep with me as last night . " " Will you not have sentries ? " he . asked . " The night is clear and the storm is over . " " Fernando goes , " Pilar said . Maria was in the back of the cave and Robert Jordan could not see her . " Good night to every one , " he had said . " I am going to sleep . " Of the others , who were laying out blankets and bedrolls on the floor in front of the cooking fire , pushing back the slab tables and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andres looked up and said , " Buenas noches . " Anselmo was already asleep in a corner , rolled in his blanket and his cape , not even his nose showing . Pablo was asleep in his chair . " Do you want a sheep hide for thy bed ? " Pilar asked Robert Jordan softly . " Nay , " he said . " Thank thee . I do not need it . " " Sleep well , " she said . " I will respond for thy material . " Fernando had gone out with him and stood a moment where Robert Jordan had spread the sleeping robe . " You have a curious idea to sleep in the open , Don Roberto , "  |p260he  said standing there in the dark , muffled in his blanket cape , his carbine slung over his shoulder . " I am accustomed to it . Good night . " " Since you are accustomed to it . " " When are you relieved ? " " At four . " " There is much cold between now and then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Since , then , you are accustomed to it  --  " Robert Jordan said politely . " Yes , " Fernando agreed . " Now I must get up there . Good night , Don Roberto . " " Good night , Fernando . " Then he had made a pillow of the things he took off and gotten into the robe and then lain and waited , feeling the spring of the boughs under the flannelly , feathered lightness of the robe warmth , watching the mouth of the cave across the snow ; feeling his heart beat as he waited . The night was clear and his head felt as clear and cold as the air . He smelled the odor of the pine boughs under him , the piney smell of the crushed needles and the sharper odor of the resinous sap from the cut limbs . Pilar , he thought . Pilar and the smell of death . This is the smell I love . This and fresh-cut clover , the crushed sage as you ride after cattle , wood-smoke and the burning leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the smell of the smoke from the piles of raked leaves burning in the streets in the fall in Missoula . Which would you rather smell ? Sweet grass the Indians used in their baskets ? Smoked leather ? The odor of the ground in the spring after rain ? The smell of the sea as you walk through the gorse on a headland in Galicia ? Or the wind from the land as you come in toward Cuba in the dark ? That was the odor of the cactus flowers , mimosa and the seagrapeshrubs . Or would you rather smell frying bacon in the morning when you are hungry ? Or coffee in the morning ? Or a Jonathan apple as you bit into it ? Or a cider mill in the grinding , or bread fresh from the oven ? You must be hungry , he thought , and he lay on his side and watched the entrance of the cave in the light that the stars reflected from the snow . P261Some one came out from under the blanket and he could see whoever it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance . Then he heard a slithering sound in the snow and then whoever it was ducked down and went back in . , I suppose she wo n't come until they are all asleep , he thought . It is a waste of time . The night is half gone . Oh , Maria . Come now quickly , Maria , for there is little time . He heard the soft sound of snow falling from a branch onto the snow on the ground . A little wind was rising . He felt it on his face . Suddenly he felt a panic that she might not come . The wind rising now reminded him how soon it would be morning . More snow fell from the branches as he heard the wind now moving the pine tops . Come now , Maria . Please come here now quickly , he thought . Oh , come here now . Do not wait . There is no importance any more to your waiting until they are asleep . Then he saw her coming out from under the blanket that covcredthe cave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was she but he could not see what she was doing . He whistled a low whistle and she was still at the cave mouth doing something in the darkness of the rock shadow . Then she came running , carrying something in her hands and he saw her running long-legged through the snow . Then she was kneeling by the robe , her head pushed hard against him , slapping the snow from her feet . She kissed him and handed him her bundle . " Put it with thy pillow , " she said . " I took these off there to save time . " " You came barefoot through the snow ? " " Yes , " she said , " and wearing only my wedding shirt . " He held her close and tight in his arms and she rubbed her head against his chin . " Avoid the feet , " she said . " They are very cold , Roberto . " " Put them here and warm them . " " Nay , " she said . " They will warm quickly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I love thee . " " Good . Good . Good . " " I love thee , little rabbit . " " Do you love my wedding shirt ? "  | " It is the same one as always . " " Yes . As last night . It is my wedding shirt . " " Put thy feet here . " " Nay , that would be abusive . They will warm of themselves . They are warm to me . It is only that the snow has made them cold toward thee . Say it again . " " I love thee , my little rabbit . " " I love thee , too , and I am thy wife . " " Were they asleep ? " " No , " she said . " But I could support it no longer . And what importance has it ? " " None , " he said , and felt her against him , slim and long and warmly lovely . " No other thing has importance . " " Put thy hand on my head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I can kiss thee . " " Was it well ? " she asked . " Yes , " he said . " Take off thy wedding shirt . " " You think I should ? " " Yes , if thou wilt not be cold . " " Que va , cold . I am on fire . " " I , too . But afterwards thou wilt not be cold ? " " No . Afterwards we will be as one animal of the forest and be so close that neither one can tell that one of us is one and not the other . Can you not feel my heart be your heart ? " " Yes . There is no difference . " " Now , feel . I am thee and thou art me and all of one is the other . And I love thee , oh , I love thee so . Are we not truly one ? Canst thou not feel it ? " " Yes , " he said . " It is true . " " And feel now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other legs , nor feet , nor of the body . " " But we are different , " she said . " I would have us exactly the same . " " You do not mean that . " " Yes I do . I do . That is a thing I had to tell thee . " " You do not mean that . " " Perhaps I do not , " she said speaking softly with her lips against his shoulder . " But I wished to say it . Since we are different I amp263glad that thou art Roberto and I Maria . But if thou should ever wish to change I would be glad to change . I would be thee because I love thee so . " " I do not wish to change . It is better to be one and each one to be the one he is . " " But we will be one now and there will never be a separate one . " Then she said , " I will be thee when thou art not there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well for thee . " " Maria . " " Yes . " " Maria . " " Yes . " " Maria . " " Oh , yes . Please . " " Art thou not cold ? " " Oh , no . Pull the robe over thy shoulders . " " Maria . " " I can not speak . " " Oh , Maria . Maria . Maria . " Then afterwards , close , with the night cold outside , in the long warmth of the robe , her head touching his cheek , she Jay quiet and happy against him and then said softly , " And thou ? " " Como tu , " he said . " Yes , " she said . " But it was not as this afternoon . " " No . " " But I loved it more . One does not need to die . " " Ojala no , " he said . " I hope not . " " I did not mean that . " " I know . I know what thou meanest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you say that instead of what I meant ? " " With a man there is a difference . " " Then I am glad that we are different . " " And so am I , " he said . " But I understood about the dying . I only spoke thus , 4s a man , from habit . I feel the same as thee . " " However thou art and however thou speakest is how I would have thee be . " " And I love thee and I love thy name , Maria . " " It is a common name . "   " No , " he said . " It is not common . " " Now should we sleep ? " she said . " I could sleep easily . " " Let us sleep , " he said , and he felt the long light body , warm against him , comforting against him , abolishing loneliness against him , magically , by a simple touching of flanks , of shoulders and of feet , making an alliance against death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , little long rabbit . " She said , " I am asleep already . " " I am going to sleep , " he said . " Sleep well , beloved . " Then he was asleep and happy as he slept . But in the night he woke and held her tight as though she were all of life and it was being taken from him . He held her feeling she was all of life there was and it was true . But she was sleeping well and soundly and she did not wake . So he rolled away onto his side and pulled the robe over her head and kissed her once on her neck under the robe and then pulled the pistol lanyard up and put the pistol by his side where he could reach it handily and then he lay there in the night thinking . P265A WARM wind came with daylight and he could hear the snow melting in the trees and the heavy sound of its falling . It was a late spring morning . He knew with the first breath he drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountains and it would be gone by noon . Then he heard a horse coming , the hoofs balled with the wet snow thumping dully as the horseman trotted . He heard the noise of a carbine scabbard slapping loosely and the creak of leather . " Maria , " he said , and shook the girl 's shoulder to waken her . " Keep thyself under the robe , " and he buttoned his shirt with one hand and held the automatic pistol in the other , loosening the safety catch with his thumb . He saw the girl 's cropped head disappear with a jerk under the robe and then he saw the horseman coming through the trees . He crouched now in the robe and holding the pistol in both hands aimed it at the man as he rode toward him . He had never seen this man before . The horseman was almost opposite him now . He was riding a big gray gelding and he wore a khaki beret , a blanket cape like a poncho , and heavy black boots . From the scabbard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long oblong clip of a short automatic rifle . He had a young , hard face and at this moment he saw Robert Jordan . He reached his hand down toward the scabbard and as he swung low , turning and jerking at the scabbard , Robert Jordan saw the scarlet of the formalized device he wore on the left breast of his khaki blanket cape . Aiming at the center of his chest , a little lower than the device , Robert Jordan fired . The pistol roared in the snowy woods . The horse plunged as though he had been spurred and the young man , still tugging at the scabbard , slid over toward the ground , his right foot caught in the stirrup . The horse broke off through the trees dragging him , bumping , face downward , and Robert Jordan stood up holding the pistol now in one hand . The big gray horse was galloping through the pines . There was a broad swath in the snow where the man dragged with a scarlet streak along one side of it . People were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jordan reached down and unrolled his trousers from the pillow and began to put them on . " Get thee dressed , " he said to Maria . Overhead he heard the noise of a plane flying very high . Through the trees he saw where the gray horse had stopped and was standing , his rider still hanging face down from the stirrup . " Go catch that horse , " he called to Primitivo who had started over toward him . Then , " Who was on guard at the top ? " " Rafael , " Pilar said from the cave . She stood there , her hair still down her back in two braids . " There 's cavalry out , " Robert Jordan said . " Get your damned gun up there . " He heard Pilar call , " Agustin , " into the cave . Then she went into the cave and then two men came running out , one with the automatic rifle with its tripod swung on his shoulder ; the other with a sackful of the pans . " Get up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You lie beside the gun and hold the legs still , " he said . The three of them went up the trail through the woods at a run . The sun had not yet come up over the tops of the mountains and Robert Jordan stood straight buttoning his trousers and tightening his belt , the big pistol hanging from the lanyard on his wrist . He put the pistol in its holster on his belt and slipped the knot down on the lanyard and passed the loop over his head . Somebody will choke you with that sometime , he thought . Well , this has done it . He took the pistol out of the holster , removed the clip , inserted one of the cartridges from the row alongside of the holster and shoved the clip back into the butt of the pistol . He looked through the trees to where Primitivo , holding the reins of the horse , was twisting the rider 's foot out of the stirrup . The body lay face down in the snow and as he watched Primitivo was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he called . " Bring the horse . " P267As he knelt to put on his rope-soled shoes , Robert Jordan could feel Maria against his knees , dressing herself under the robe . She had no place in his life now . That cavalryman did not expect anything , he was thinking . He was not following horse tracks and he was not even properly alert , let alone alarmed . He was not even following the tracks up to the post . He must have been one of a patrol scattered out in these hills . But when the patrol misses him they will follow his tracks here . Unless the snow melts first , he thought . Unless something happens to the patrol . " You better get down below , " he said to Pablo . They were all out of the cave now , standing there with the carbinesand with grenades on their belts . Pilar held a leather bag of grenades toward Robert Jordan and he took three and put them in his pocket . He ducked into the cave , found his two packs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took out the barrel and stock , slipped the stock onto the forward assembly and put one clip into the gun and three in his pockets . He locked the pack and started for the door . I 've got two pockets full of hardware , he thought . I hope the seams hold . He came out of the cave and said to Pablo , " I 'm going up above . Can Agustin shoot-that gun ? " " Yes , " Pablo said . He was watching Primitivo leading up the horse . " Mira que caballo , " he said . " Look , what a horse . " The big gray was sweating and shivering a little and Robert Jordanpatted him on the withers . " I will put him with the others , " Pablo said . " No , " Robert Jordan said . " He has made tracks into here . He must make them out . " " True , " agreed Pablo . " I will ride him out and will hide him and bring him in when the snow is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Send some one below , " Robert Jordan said . " We 've got to get up there . " " It is not necessary , " Pablo said . " Horsemen can not come that way . But we can get out , by there and by two other places . It is better not to make tracks if there are planes coming . Give me the bota with wine , Pilar . "   " To go off and get drunk , " Pilar said . " Here , take these instead . " He reached over and put two of the grenades in his pockets . " Que. va , to get drunk , " Pablo said . " There is gravity in the situation . But give me the bota . I do not like to do all this on water . " He reached his arms up , took the reins and swung up into the saddle . He grinned and patted the nervous horse . Robert Jordan saw him rub his leg along the horse 's flank affectionately . " Que caballo ma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray again . " Que caballo ma 's hermoso . Come on . The faster this gets out of here the better . " He reached down and pulled the light automatic rifle with its ventilated barrel , really a submachine gun built to take the g mm. pistol cartridge , from the scabbard , and looked at it . " Look how they are armed , " he said . " Look at modern cavalry . " " There 's modern cavalry over there on his face , " Robert Jordan said . " Vamonos . " " Do you , Andres , saddle and hold the horses in readiness . If you hear firing bring them up to the woods behind the gap . Come with thy arms and leave the women to hold the horses . Fernando , see that my sacks are brought also . Above all , that my sacks are brought carefully . Thou to look after my sacks , too , " he said to Pilar . " Thou to verify that they come with the horses . Vamonos , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will prepare all for leaving , " Pilar said . Then to Robert Jordan , " Look at him , " nodding at Pablo on the gray horse , sitting him in the heavy-thighed herdsman manner , the horse 's nostrils widening as Pablo replaced the clip in the automatic rifle . " See what a horse has done for him . " " That I should have two horses , " Robert Jordan said fervently . " Danger is thy horse . " " Then give me a mule , " Robert Jordan grinned . " Strip me that , " he said to Pilar and jerked his head toward where the man lay face down in the snow . " And bring everything , all the letters and papers , and put them in the outside pocket of my sack . Everything , understand ? " " Yes . " " Vamonos , " he said . Pablo rode ahead and the two men followed in single file in or/der not to track up the snow . Robert Jordan carried the submachine gun muzzle down , carrying it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same ammunition that saddle gun takes , he thought . But it does n't . This is a German gun . This was old Kashkin 's gun . The sun was coming over the mountains now . A warm wind was blowing and the snow was melting . It was a lovely late spring morning . Robert Jordan looked back and saw Maria now standing with Pilar . Then she came running up the trail . He dropped behind Primitivo to speak to her . " Thou , " she said . " Can I go with thee ? " " No . Help Pilar . " She was walking behind him and put her hand on his arm . " I 'm coming . " " Nay . " She kept on walking close behind him . " I could hold the legs of the gun in the way thou told Anselmo . " " Thou wilt hold no legs . Neither of guns nor of nothing . " Walking beside him she reached forward and put her hand inhis pocket . " No , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Kiss me , " she said , " if thou goest . " " Thou art shameless , " he said . " Yes , " she said . " Totally . " " Get thee back now . There is much work to do . We may fight here if they follow these horse tracks . " " Thou , " she said . " Didst thee see what he wore on his chest ? " " Yes . Why not ? " " It was the Sacred Heart . " " Yes . All the people of Navarre wear it . " " And thou shot for that ? " " No . Below it . Get thee back now . " " Thou , " she said . " I saw all . " " Thou saw nothing . One man . One man from a horse . Vete , Get thee back . " " Say that you love me . " " No . Not now . " " Not love me now ? "   " Dejamos . Get thee back . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . " " I want to go to hold the legs of the gun and while it speaks love thee all in the same moment . " " Thou art crazy . Get thee back now . " " I am not crazy , " she said . " I love thee . " " Then get thee back . " " Good . I go . And if thou dost not love me , I love thee enough for both . " He looked at her and smiled through his thinking . " When you hear firing , " he said , " come with the horses . Aid the Pilar with my sacks . It is possible there will be nothing . I hope so . " " I go , " she said . " Look what a horse Pablo rides . " The big gray was moving ahead up the trail . " Yes . But go . " " I go . " Her fist , clenched tight in his pocket , beat hard against his thigh . He looked at her and saw there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his pocket and put both arms tight around his neck and kissed him . " I go , " she said . " Me voy . I go . " He looked back and saw her standing there , the first morning sunlight on her brown face and the cropped , tawny , burned-gold hair . She lifted her fist at him and turned and walked back down the trail , her head down . Primitivo turned around and looked after her . " If she did not have her hair cut so short she would be a pretty girl , " he said . " Yes , " Robert Jordan said . He was thinking of something else . " How is she in the bed ? " Primitivo asked . " What ? " " ln the bed . " " Watch thy mouth . " " One should not be offended when  --  " " Leave it , " Robert Jordan said . He was looking at the position.  | " Cut ME pine branches , " Robert Jordan said to Primitivo , " and bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun there , " he said to Agustin . " Why ? " " Place it over there , " Robert Jordan pointed , " and later I will tell thee . " " Here , thus . Let me help thee . Here , " he said , then squatted down , He looked out across the narrow oblong , noting the height of the rocks on either side . " It must be farther , " he said , " farther out . Good . Here . That will do until it can be done properly . There . Put the stones there . Here is one . Put another there at the side . Leave room for the muzzle to swing . The stone must be farther to this side . Anselmo . Get thee clown to the cave and bring me an ax . Quickly . " . " Have you never had a proper emplacement for the gun ? " he said to Agustin . " We always placed it here . " " Kashkin never said to put it there ? " " No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did no one bring it who knew how to use it ? " " No . It was brought by porters . " " What a way to do things , " Robert Jordan said . " It was just given to you without instruction ? " " Yes , as a gift might be given . One for us and one for El Sordo . Four men brought them . Anselmo guided them . " " It was a wonder they did not lose them with four men to cross the lines . " " I thought so , too , " Agustin said . " I thought those who sent them meant for them to be lost . But Anselmo brought them well . " " You know how to handle it ? " " Yes . I have experimented . I know . Pablo knows . Primitivo knows . So does Fernando . We have made a study of taking it apart and putting it together on the table in the cave . Once we had it apart and could not get it together for two days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Does it shoot now ? " " Yes . But we do not let the gypsy nor others frig with it . " " You see ? From there it was useless , " he said . " Look . Those rocks which should protect your flanks give cover to those who will attack you . With such a gun you must seek a flatness over which to fire . Also you must take them sideways . See ? Look now . All that is dominated . " " I see , " said Agustin . " But we have never fought in defense except when our town was taken . At the train there were soldiers with the maquina . " " Then we will all learn together , " Robert Jordan said . " There are a few things to observe . Where is the gypsy who should be here ? " " I do not know . " " Where is it possible for him to be ? " " I do not know . " Pablo had ridden out through the pass and turned once and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top that was the field of fire for the automatic rifle . Now Robert Jordan watched him riding down the slope alongside the tracks the horse had left when he was ridden in . He disappeared in the trees turning off to the left . " I hope he does n't run right into cavalry , " Robert Jordan thought " I 'm afraid we 'd have him right here in our laps . " Primitivo brought the pine branches and Robert Jordan stuck them through the snow into the unfrozen earth , arching them over the gun from either side . " Bring more , " he said . " There must be cover for the two men who serve it . This is not good but it will serve until the ax comes Listen , " he said , " if you hear a plane lie flat wherever thou art in the shadows of the rocks . I am here with the gun . " Now with the sun up and the warm wind blowing it was pleasant on the side of the rocks where the sun shone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and me , Anselmo , Primitivo , Fernando , Agustin , what the hell is the name of the other brother ? That 's eight . Not counting the gypsy . Makes nine . Plus Pablo gone with one horse makes ten . Andres is his name . The other brother.  |p273Plus  the other , Eladio . Makes ten . That 's not one-half a horse apiece . Three men can hold this and four can get away . Five with Pablo . That 's two left over . Three with Eladio . Where the hell is he ? God knows what will happen to Sordo today if they picked up the trail of those horses in the snow . That was tough ; the snow stopping that way . But it melting today will even things up . But not for Sordo . I 'm afraid it 's too late to even it up for Sordo . If we can last through today and not have to fight we can swing the whole show tomorrow with what we have . I know we can . Not well , maybe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as we would have done ; but using everybody we can swing it . If we do n't have to fight today . God help us if we have to fight today . I do n't know any place better to lay up in the meantime than this . If we move now we only leave tracks . This is as good a place as any and if the worst gets to be the worst there are three ways out of this place . There is the dark then to come and from wherever we are in these hills , I can reach and do the bridge at daylight . I do n't know why I worried about it before . It seems easy enough now . I hope they get the planes up on time for once . I certainly hope that . Tomorrow is going to be a day with dust . on the road . Well , today will be very interesting or very dull . Thank God we 've got that cavalry mount out and away from here . I do n't think even if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those tracks are now . They 'll think he stopped and circled and they 'll pick up Pablo 's tracks . I wonder where the old swine will go . He 'll probably leave tracks like an old bull elk spooking out of the country and work way up and then when the snow melts circle back below . That horse certainly did things for him . Of course he may have just mucked off with him too Well , he should be able to take care of himself . He 's been doing this a long time . I would n't trust him farther than you can throw Mount Everest , though . I suppose it 's smarter to use these rocks and build a good blind for this gun than to make a proper emplacement for it . You 'd be digging and get caught with your pants down if they come or if the planes come . She will hold this , the way she is , as long as it is any use to hold it , and anyway I ca n't stay to fight . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to takcp274Anselmo with me . Who would stay to cover us while we got away if we have to fight here ? Just then , while he was watching all of the country that was visible , he saw the gypsy coming through the rocks to the left . He was walking with a loose , high-hipped , sloppy swing , his carbine was slung on his back , his brown face was grinning and he carried two big hares , one in each hand . He carried them by the legs , heads swinging . " Hola , Roberto , " he called cheerfully . Robert Jordan put his hand to his mouth , and the gypsy looked startled . He slid over behind the rocks to where Robert Jordan was crouched beside the brush-shielded automatic rifle . He crouched down and laid the hares in the snow . Robert Jordan looked up at him . " You hijo de la gran puta ! " he said softly . " Where the obscenity have you been ? " " I tracked them , " the gypsy said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love in the snow . " " And thy post ? " " It was not for long , " the gypsy whispered . " What passes ? Is there an alarm ? " " There is cavalry out . " " Redios ! " the gypsy said . " Hast thou seen them ? " " There is one at the camp now , " Robert Jordan said . " He came for breakfast . " " I thought I heard a shot or something like one , " the gypsy said . " I obscenity in the milk ! Did he come through here ? " " Here . Thy post . " " Ay , mi madre ! " the gypsy said . " I am a poor , unlucky man . " " If thou wert not a gypsy , I would shoot thee . " " No , Roberto . Do n't say that . I am sorry . It was the hares . Before daylight I heard the male thumping in the snow . You can not imagine what a debauch they were engaged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I followed the tracks in the snow and high up I found them together and slew them both . Feel the fatness of the two for this time of year . Think what the Pilar will do with those two . I am sorry , Roberto , as sorry as thee . Was the cavalryman killed ? "  | " Yes . " " By thee ? " " Yes . " " Que do ! " the gypsy said in open flattery . " Thou art a veritablephenomenon . " " Thy mother ! " Robert Jordan said . He could not help grinning at the gypsy . " Take thy hares to camp and bring us up some breakfast . " He put a hand out and felt of the hares that lay limp , long , heavy , thick-furred , big-footed and long-eared in the snow , their round dark eyes open . " They are fat , " he said . " Fat ! " the gypsy said . " There 's a tub of lard on the ribs of each one . In my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go then , " Robert Jordan said , " and come quickly with the breakfast and bring to me the documentation of that requete . Ask Pilar for it . " " You are not angry with me , Roberto ? " " Not angry . Disgusted that you should leave your post . Supposeit had been a troop of cavalry ? " " Redios , " the gypsy said . " How reasonable you are . " " Listen to me . You can not leave a post again like that . Never . I do not speak of shooting lightly . " " Of course not . And another thing . Never would such an opportunityas the two hares present itself again . Not in the life of one man . " " Anda ! " Robert Jordan said . " And hurry back . " The gypsy picked up the two hares and slipped back through the rocks and Robert Jordan looked out across the flat opening and the slopes of the hill below . Two crows circled overhead and then lit in a pine tree below . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thought : those are my sentinels . As long as those are quiet there is no one coming through the trees . The gypsy , he thought . He is truly worthless . He has no political development , nor any discipline , and you could not rely on him for anything . But I need him for tomorrow . I have a use for him tomorrow . It 's odd to see a gypsy in a war . They should be exempted like conscientious objectors . Or as the physically and mentally unfit . They are worthless . But conscientious objectors were n't exempted in this war . No one was exempted . It came to one and all alike . Well , it had come here now to this lazy outfit . They had it now . Agustin and Primitivo came up with the brush and Robert Jordan built a good blind for the automatic rifle , a blind that would conceal the gun from the air and that would look natural from the forest . He showed them where to place a man high in the rocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below and to the right , and another where he could command the only stretch where the left wall might be climbed . " Do not fire if you see any one from there , " Robert Jordan said . " Roll a rock down as a warning , a small rock , and signal to us with thy rifle , thus , " he lifted the rifle and held it over his head as though guarding it . " Thus for numbers , " he lifted the rifle up and down . " If they are dismounted point thy rifle muzzle at the ground . Thus . Do not fire from there until thou hearest the maquina fire . Shoot at a man 's knees when you shoot from that height . If you hear me whistle twice on this whistle get down , keeping behind cover , and come to these rocks where themaquina is . " Primitivo raised the rifle . " I understand , " he said . " It is very simple . " " Send first the small rock as a warning and indicate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Yes , " Primitivo said . " If I can throw a grenade ? " " Not until the maquina has spoken . It may be that cavalry will come searching for their comrade and still not try to enter . They may follow the tracks of Pablo . We do not want combat if it can be avoided . Above all that we should avoid it . Now get up there . " " Me voy , " Primitivo said , and climbed up into the high rocks with his carbine . " Thou , Agustin , " Robert Jordan said . " What do you know of the gun ? " Agustin squatted there , tall , black , stubbly-joweled , with his sunken eyes and thin mouth and his big work- " Pues , to load it . To aim it . To shoot it . Nothing more . " " You must not fire until they are within fifty meters and only when you are sure they will be coming into the pass which leads to the cave , " Robert Jordan said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That rock . " " If there is an officer shoot him first . Then move the gun onto the others . Move very slowly . It takes little movement . I will teach Fernando to tap it . Hold it tight so that it does not jump and sight carefully and do not fire more than six shots at a time if you can help it . For the fire of the gun jumps upward . But each time fire at one man and then move from him to another . At a man on a horse , shoot at his belly . " " Yes . " " One man should hold the tripod still so that the gun does not jump . Thus . He will load the gun for thee . " " And where will you be ? " " I will be here on the left . Above , where I can see all and I will cover thy left with this small maquina . Here . If they should come it would be possible to make a massacre . But you must not fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we could make a massacre . Menuda matanza ! " " But I hope they do not come . " " If it were not for thy bridge we could make a massacre here and get out . " " It would avail nothing . That would serve no purpose . The bridge is a part of a plan to win the war . This would be nothing . This would be an incident . A nothing . " " Que va , nothing . Every fascist dead is a fascist less . " " Yes . But with this of the bridge we can take Segovia . The Capital of a Province . Think of that . It will be the first one we will take . " " Thou believest in this seriously ? That we can take Segovia ? " " Yes . It is possible with the bridge blown correctly . " " I would like to have the massacre here and the bridge , too . " " Thou hast much appetite , " Robert Jordan told him . All this time he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . The bird cawed and flew up . Butp278the other crow still stayed in the tree . Robert Jordan looked up toward Primitivo 's place high in the rocks . He saw him watching out over the country below but he made no signal . Robert Jordan leaned forward and worked the lock on the automatic rifle , saw the round in the chamber and let the lock down . The crow was still there in the tree . The other circled wide over the snow and then settled again . In the sun and the warm wind the snow was falling from the laden branches of the pines . " I have a massacre for thee for tomorrow morning , " Robert Jordan said . " It is necessary to exterminate the post at the saw-mill . " " I am ready , " Agustin said . " Estoy listo . " " Also the post at the road mender 's hut below the bridge . " " For the one or for the other , " Agustin said , " Or for both . " " Not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " RobertJordan said . " Then for either one , " Agustin said . " Now for a long time have I wished for action in this war . Pablo has rotted us here with inaction . " Anselmo came up with the ax . " Do you wish more branches ? " he asked . " To me it seems well hidden . " " Not branches , " Robert Jordan said . " Two small trees that we can plant here and there to make it look more natural . There are not enough trees here for it to be truly natural . " " I will bring them . " " Cut them well back , so the stumps can not be seen . " Robert Jordan heard the ax sounding in the woods behind him . He looked up at Primitivo above in the rocks and he looked down at the pines below across the clearing . The one crow was still there . Then he heard the first high , throbbing murmur of a plane coming . He looked up and saw it high and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move in the high sky . " They can not see us , " he said to Agustin . " But it is well to keep down . That is the second observation plane today . " " And those of yesterday ? " Agustin asked . " They are like a bad dream now , " Robert Jordan said.  | " They must be at Segovia . The bad dream waits there to become a reality . " The plane was out of sight now over the mountains but the sound of its motors still persisted . As Robert Jordan looked , he saw the crow fly- up . He flew straight away through the trees without cawing.  | " GET THEE down , " Robert Jordan whispered to Agustin , and he turned his head and flicked his hand Down , Down , to Anselmo who was coming through the gap with a pine tree , carrying it over his shoulder like a Christmas tree . He saw the old man drop his pine tree behind a rock and then he was out of sight in the rocks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the timber . He saw nothing and heard nothing but he could feel his heart pounding and then he heard the clack of stone on stone and the leaping , dropping clicks of a small rock falling . He turned his head to the right and looking up saw Primitivo 's rifle raised and lowered four times horizontally . Then there was nothing more to see but the white stretch in front of him with the circle of horse tracks and the timber beyond . " Cavalry , " he said softly to Agustin . Agustin looked at him and his dark , sunken cheeks widened at their base as he grinned . Robert Jordan noticed he was sweating . He reached over and put his hand on his shoulder . His hand was still there as they saw the four horsemen ride out of the timber and he felt the muscles in Agustin 's back twitch under his hand . One horseman was ahead and three rode behind . The one ahead was following the horse tracks . He looked down as he rode . The other three came behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all watching carefully . Robert Jordan felt his heart beating against the snowy ground as he lay , his elbows spread wide and watched them over the sights of the automatic rifle . The man who was leading rode along the trail to where Pablo had circled and stopped . The others rode up to him and they all stopped . Robert Jordan saw them clearly over the blued steel barrel of the automatic rifle . He saw the faces of the men , the sabers hanging , the sweat-darkened flanks of the horses , and the cone/like slope of the khaki capes , and the Navarrese slant of the khaki berets . The leader turned his horse directly toward the opening in the rocks where the gun was placed and Robert Jordan saw his young , sun- and wind-darkened face , his close-set eyes , hawk nose and the over-long wedge-shaped chin . Sitting his horse there , the horse 's chest toward Robert Jordan , the horse 's head high , the butt of the light automatic rifle projectingforward from the scabbard at the right of the saddle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Robert Jordan sunk his elbows into the ground and looked along the barrel at the four riders stopped there in the snow . Three of them had their automatic rifles out . Two carried them across the pommels of their saddles . The other sat his horse with the rifle swung out to the right , the butt resting against his hip . You hardly ever see them at such range , he thought . Not along the barrel of one of these do you see them like this . Usually the rear sight is raised and they seem miniatures of men and you have hell to make it carry up there ; or they come running , flopping , running , and you beat a slope with fire or bar a certain street , or keep it on the windows ; or far away you see them marching on a road . Only at the trains do you see them like this . Only then are they like now , and with four of these you can make them scatter . Over the gun sights , at this range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thou , he thought , looking at the wedge of the front sight placed now firm in the slot of the rear sight , the top of the wedge against the center of the leader 's chest , a little to the right of the scarlet device that showed bright in the morning sun against the khaki cape . Thou , he thought , thinking in Spanish now and pressing his fingers forward against the trigger guard to keep it away from where it would bring the quick , shocking , hurtling rush from the automatic rifle . Thou , he thought again , thou art dead now in thy youth . And thou , he thought , and thou , and thou . But let it not happen . Do not let it happen . He felt Agustin beside him start to cough , felt him hold it , choke and swallow . Then as he looked along the oiled blue of the barrel out through the opening between the branches , his finger still pressed forward against the trigger guard , he saw the leader turn his horse and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The four of them trotted into the timber and Agustin said softly , " Cabrones ! " Robert Jordan looked behind him at the rocks where Anselmo had dropped the tree . The gypsy , Rafael , was coming toward them through the rocks , carrying a pair of cloth saddlebags , his rifle slung on his back . Robert Jordan waved him down and the gypsy ducked out of sight . " We could have killed all four , " Agustin said quietly . He was still wet with sweat . " Yes , " Robert Jordan whispered . " But with the firing who knows what might have come ? " Just then he heard the noise of another rock falling and he looked around quickly . But both the gypsy and Anselmo were out of sight . He looked at his wrist watch and then up to where Primitivo was raising and lowering his rifle in what seemed an infinity of short jerks . Pablo has forty-five minutes ' start , Robert Jordan thought , and then he heard the noise of a body of cavalry coming . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do not worry . They will pass as the others . " They came into sight trotting along the edge of the timber in column of twos , twenty mounted men , armed and uniformed as the others had been , their sabers swinging , their carbines in their holsters ; and then they went down into the timber as the others had . " Tu ties ? " Robert Jordan said to Agustin . " Thou seest ? " " There were many , " Agustin said . " These would we have had to deal with if we had destroyed the others , " Robert Jordan said very softly . His heart had quieted now and his shirt felt wet on his chest from the melting snow . There was a hollow feeling in his chest . The sun was bright on the snow and it was melting fast . He could see it hollowing away from the tree trunks and just ahead of the gun , before his eyes , the snow surface was damp and lacily fragile as the heat of the sun melted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the snow that lay upon it ..  |p283Robert  Jordan looked up at Primitivo 's post and saw him signal , " Nothing , " crossing his two hands , palms down . Anselmo 's head showed above a rock and Robert Jordan motionedhim up . The old man slipped from rock to rock until he crept up and lay down flat beside the gun . " Many , " he said . " Many ! " " I do not need the trees , " Robert Jordan said to him . " There is no need for further forestal improvement . " Both Anselmo and Agustin grinned . " This has stood scrutiny well and it would be dangerous to plant trees now because those people will return and perhaps they are not stupid . " He felt the need to talk that , with him , was the sign that there had just been much danger . He could always tell how bad it had been by the strength of the desire to talk that came after . " It was a good blind , eh ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To obscenity with all fascism good . We could have killed the four of them . Didst thou see ? " he said to Anselmo . " I saw . " " Thou , " Robert Jordan said to Anselmo . " Thou must go to the post of yesterday or another good post of thy selection to watch the road and report on all movement as of yesterday . Already we are late in that . Stay until dark . Then come in and we will send another . " " But the tracks that I will make ? " " Go from below as soon as the snow is gone . The road will be muddied by the snow . Note if there has been much traffic of trucks or if there are tank tracks in the softness on the road . That is all we can tell until you are there to observe . " " With your permission ? " the old man asked . " Surely . " " With your permission , would it not be better for me to go into La Granja and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to observe today thus in the manner you have taught me ? Such a one could report tonight or , better , I could go again to La Granja for the report . " " Have you no fear of encountering cavalry ? "  | " Not when the snow is gone . " " Is there some one in La Granja capable of this ? " " Yes . Of this , yes . It would be a woman . There are various women of trust in La Granja . " " I believe it , " Agustin said . " More , I know it , and several who serve for other purposes . You do not wish me to go ? " " Let the old man go . You understand this gun and the day is not over . " " I will go when the snow melts , " Anselmo said . " And the snow is melting fast . " " What think you of their chance of catching Pablo ? " Robert Jordan asked Agustin . " Pablo is smart , " Agustin said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Sometimes , " Robert Jordan said . " Not Pablo , " Agustin said . " Clearly , he is only a garbage of what he once was . But it is not for nothing that he is alive and comfortable in these hills and able to drink himself to death while there are so many others that have died against a wall . " " Is he as smart as they say ? " " He is much smarter . " " He has not seemed of great ability here . " " Como que no ? If he were not of great ability he would have died last night . It seems to me you do not understand politics , Ingles , nor guerilla warfare . In politics and this other the first thing is to continue to exist . Look how he continued to exist last night . And the quantity of dung he ate both from me and from thee . " Now that Pablo was back in the movements of the unit , Robert Jordan did not wish to talk against him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing about his ability . He knew himself how smart Pablo was . It was Pablo who had seen instantlyall that was wrong with the orders for the destruction of the bridge . He had made the remark only from dislike and he knew as he made it that it was wrong . It was part of the talking too much after a strain . So now he dropped the matter and said to Anselmo , " And to go into La Granja in daylight ? " " It is not bad , " the old man said . " I will not go with a military band . "  | " Nor with a bell around his neck , " Agustin said . " Nor carrying a banner . " " How will you go ? " " Above and down through the forest . " " But if they pick you up . " " I have papers . " " So have we all but thou must eat the wrong ones quickly . " Anselmo shook his head and tapped the breast pocket of his smock . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " And never did I like to swallow paper . " " I have thought we should carry a little mustard on them all , " Robert Jordan said . " In my left breast pocket I carry our papers . In my right the fascist papers . Thus one does not make a mistake in an emergency . " It must have been bad enough when the leader of the first patrol of cavalry had pointed toward the entry because they were all talking very much . Too much , Robert Jordan thought . " But look , Roberto , " Agustin said . " They say the government moves further to the right each clay . That in the Republic they no longer say Comrade but Senor and Senora . Canst shift thy pockets ? " " When it moves far enough to the right I will carry them in my hip pocket , " Robert Jordan said , " and sew it in the center . " " That they should stay in thy shirt , " Agustin said . " Are we to win this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Robert Jordan said . " But if we do not win this war there will be no revolution nor any Republic nor any thou nor any me nor anything but the most grand carajo . " " So say I , " Anselmo said . " That we should win the war . " " And afterwards shoot the anarchists and the Communists and all this canalla except the good Republicans , " Agustin said . " That we should win this war and shoot nobody , " Anselmo said . " That we should govern justly and that all should participate in the benefits according as they have striven for them . And that those who have fought against us should be educated to see their error . " " We will have to shoot many , " Agustin said . " Many , many , many . "  | He thumped his closed right fist against the palm of his left hand . " That we should shoot none . Not even the leaders . That they should be reformed by work . " " I know the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he picked up some snow and put it in his mouth . " What , bad one ? " Robert Jordan asked . " Two trades of the utmost brilliance . " " They are ? " Agustin put some more snow in his mouth and looked across the clearing where the cavalry had ridden . Then he spat the melted snow out . " Vaya . What a breakfast , " he said . " Where is the filthy gypsy ? " " What trades ? " Robert Jordan asked him . " Speak , bad mouth . " " Jumping from planes without parachutes , " Agustin said , and his eyes shone . " That for those that we care for . And being nailed to the tops of fence posts to be pushed over backwards for the others . " " That way of speaking is ignoble , " Anselmo said . " Thus we will never have a Republic . " " I would like to swim ten leagues in a strong soup made from the cojones of all of them , " Agustin said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought that we might kill them I was like a mare in the corral waiting for the stallion . " " You know why we did not kill them , though ? " Robert Jordan said quietly . " Yes , " Agustin said . " Yes . But the necessity was on me as it is on a mare in heat . You can not know what it is if you have not felt it . " " You sweated enough , " Robert Jordan said . " I thought it was-fear . " " Fear , yes , " Agustin said . " Fear and the other . And in this life there is no stronger thing than the other . " Yes , Robert Jordan thought . We do it coldly but they do not , nor ever have . It is their extra sacrament . Their old one that they had before the new religion came from the far end of the Mediterranean , the one they have never abandoned but only suppressed and hidden to bring it out again in wars and inquisitions . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of faith . Killing isp287something one must do , but ours are different from theirs . And you , he thought , you have never been corrupted by it ? You never had it in the Sierra ? Nor at Usera ? Nor through all the time in Estremadura ? Nor at any time ? Que. va , he told himself . At every train . Stop making dubious literature about the Berbers and the old Iberians and admit that you have liked to kill as all who are soldiers by choice have enjoyed it at some time whether they lie about it or not . Anselmo does not like to because he is a hunter , not a soldier . Do n't idealize him , either . Hunters kill animals and soldiers kill men . Do n't lie to yourself , he thought . Nor make up literature about it . You have been tainted with it for a long time now . And do not think against Anselmo either . He is a Christian . Something very rare in Catholic countries . But with Agustin I had thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action . So it was the other , too . Of course , he may be bragging now . There was plenty of fear . I felt the fear under my hand . Well , it was time to stop talking . " See if the gypsy brought food , " he said to Anselmo . " Do not let him come up . He is a fool . Bring it yourself . And however much he brought , send back for more . I am hungry . "  |p288Now  THE morning was late May , the sky was high and clear and the wind blew warm on Robert Jordan 's shoulders . The snow was going fast and they were eating breakfast . There were two big sandwiches of meat and the goaty cheese apiece , and Robert Jordan had cut thick slices of onion with his clasp knife and put them on each side of the meat and cheese between the chunks Df bread . " You will have a breath that will carry through the forest to the fascists , " Agustin said , his own mouth full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mouth , " Robert Jordan said , his mouth full of meat , cheese , onion and chewed bread . He had never been hungrier and he filled his mouth with wine , faintly tarry-tasting from the leather bag , and swallowed . Then he took another big mouthful of wine , lifting the bag up ao let the jet of wine spurt into the back of his mouth , the wineskintouching the needles of the blind of pine branches that coveredthe automatic rifle as he lifted his hand , his head leaning against the pine branches as he bent it back to let the wine run down . " Dost thou want this other sandwich ? " Agustin asked him , handingit toward him across the gun . " No . Thank you . Eat it . " " I can not . I am not accustomed to eat in the morning . " " You do not want it , truly ? " " Nay . Take it . " Robert Jordan took it and laid it on his lap while he got the onion out of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife to slice it . He cut off a thin sliver of the surface that had dirtied in his pocket , then cut a thick slice . An outerp289segment fell and he picked it up and bent the circle together and put it into the sandwich . " Eatest thou always onions for breakfast ? " Agustin asked . " When there are any . " " Do all in thy country do this ? " " Nay , " Robert Jordan said . " It is looked on badly there . " " I am glad , " Agustin said . " I had always considered America a civilized country . " " What bast thou against the onion ? " " The odor . Nothing more . Otherwise it is like the rose . " Robert Jordan grinned at him with his mouth full . " Like the rose , " he said . " Mighty like the rose . A rose is a rose is an onion . " " Thy onions are affecting thy brain , " Agustin said . " Take care . " " An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jordan said cheerily and , he thought , a stone is a stein is a rock is a boulder is a pebble . " Rinse thy mouth with wine , " Agustin said . " Thou art very rare , Inglis . There is great difference between thee and the last dynamiter who worked with us . " " There is one great difference . " " Tell it to me . " " I am alive and he is dead , " Robert Jordan said . Then : what 's the matter with you ? he thought . Is that the way to talk ? Does food make you that slap happy ? What are you , drunk on onions ? Is that all it means to you , now ? It never meant much , he told himself truly . You tried to make it mean something , but it never did . There is no need to lie in the time that is left . " No , " he said , seriously now . " That one was a man who had suffered greatly . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , " said Robert Jordan . " I am of those who suffer little . " " Me also , " Agustin told him . " There are those who suffer and those who do not . I suffer very little . " " Less bad , " Robert Jordan tipped up the wineskin again . " And with this , less . " " I suffer for others . " " As all good men should . "  | " But for myself very little . " " Hast thou a wife ? " " No . " " Me neither . " " But now you have the Maria . " " Yes . " " There is a rare thing , " Agustin said . " Since she came to us at the train the Pilar has kept her away from all as fiercely as though she were in a convent of Carmelites . You can not imagine with what fierceness she guarded her . You come , and she gives her to thee as a present . How does that seem to thee ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then ? " " She has put her in my care . " " And thy care is to joder with her all night ? " " With luck . " " What a manner to care for one . " " You do not understand that one can take good care of one thus ? " " Yes , but such care could have been furnished by any one of us . " " Let us not talk of it any more , " Robert Jordan said . " I care for her seriously . " " Seriously ? " " As there can be nothing more serious in this world . " " And afterwards ? After this of the bridge ? " " She goes with me . " " Then , " Agustin said . " That no one speaks of it further and that the two of you go with all luck . " He lifted the leather wine bag and took a long pull , then handed it to Robert Jordan . " One thing more , Ingle 's , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her , too . " Robert Jordan put his hand on his shoulder . " Much , " Agustin said . " Much . More than one is able to imagine . " " I can imagine . "  | " She has made an impression on me that does not dissipate . " " I can imagine . " " Look . I say this to thee in all seriousness . " " Say it . " " I have never touched her nor had anything to do with her but I care for her greatly . Ingles , do not treat her lightly . Because she sleeps with thee she is no whore . " " I will care for her . " " I believe thee . But more . You do not understand how such a girl would be if there had been no revolution . You have much responsibility . This one , truly , has suffered much . She is not as we are . " " I will marry her . " " Nay . Not that . There is no need for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head  --  " it would be better . " " I will marry her , " Robert Jordan said and could feel his throat swelling as he said it . " I care for her greatly . " " Later , " Agustin said . " When it is convenient . The important thing is to have the intention . " " I have it . " " Listen , " Agustin said . " I am speaking too much of a matter in which I have no right to intervene , but hast thou known many girls of this country ? " " A few . " " Whores ? " " Some who were not . " " How many ? " " Several . " " And did you sleep with them ? " " No . " " You see ? " " Yes . " " What I mean is that this Maria does not do this lightly . " " Nor I. " " If I thought you did I would have shot you last night as you lay with her . For this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , " Robert Jordan said . " It is because of the lack of time that there has been informality . What we do not have is time . Tomorrow we must fight . To me that is nothing . But for the Maria and me it means that we must live all of our life in this time . " " And a day and a night is little time , " Agustin said . " Yes . But there has been yesterday and the night before and last night . " " Look , " Agustin said . " If I can aid thee . " " No . We are all right . " " If I could do anything for thee or for the cropped head --  " " No . " " Truly , there is little one man can do for another . " " No . There is much . " " What ? " " No matter what passes today and tomorrow in respect to combat , give me thy confidence and obey even though the orders may appear wrong . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sending away of the horse . " " That was nothing . You see that we are working for one thing . To win the war . Unless we win , all other things are futile . Tomorrowwe have a thing of great importance . Of true importance . Also we will have combat . In combat there must be discipline . For many things are not as they appear . Discipline must come from trust and confidence . " Agustin spat on the ground . " The Maria and all such things are apart , " he said . " That you and the Maria should make use of what time there is as two human beings . If I can aid thee I am at thy orders . But for the thing of tomorrow I will obey thee blindly . If it is necessary that one should die for the thing of tomorrow one goes gladly and with the heart light . " " Thus do I feel , " Robert Jordan said . " But to hear it from thee brings pleasure . " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he pointed toward Primitivo , " is a dependable value . The Pilar is much , much more than thou canst imagine . The old man Anselmo , also . Andres also . Eladio also . Very quiet , but a dependable element . And Fernando . I do not know how thou hast appreciated him . It is true he isp293heavier than mercury . He is fuller of boredom than a steer drawing a cart on the highroad . But to fight and to do as he is told . Es muy hombre ! Thou wilt see . " " We are lucky . " " No . We have two weak elements . The gypsy and Pablo . But the band of Sordo are as much better than we are as we are better than goat manure . " " All is well then . " " Yes , " Agustin said . " But I wish it was for today . " " Me , too . To finish with it . But it is not . " " Do you think it will be bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thou art very cheerful now , Ingles . " " Yes . " " Me also . In spite of this of the Maria and all . " " Do you know why ? " " No . " " Me neither . Perhaps it is the day . The day is good . " " Who knows ? Perhaps it is that we will have action . " " I think it is that , " Robert Jordan said . " But not today . Of all things ; of all importance we must avoid it today . " As he spoke he heard something . It was a noise far off that came above the sound of the warm wind in the trees . He could not be sure and he held his mouth open and listened , glancing up at Primitivo as he did so . He thought he heard it but then it was gone . The wind was blowing in the pines and now Robert Jordan strained all of himself to listen . Then he heard it faintly coming down the wind . " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That I should never have the Maria is nothing . I will go with the whores as always . " " Shut up , " he said , not listening , and lying beside him , his head having been turned away . Agustin looked over at him suddenly . " Que pasa ? " he asked . Robert Jordan put his hand over his own mouth and went on listening . There it came again . It came faint , muted , dry and far away . But there was no mistaking it now . It was the precise , crackling , curling roll of automatic rifle fire . It sounded as though pack after pack of miniature firecrackers were going off at a distance that was almost out of hearing . Robert Jordan looked up at Primitivo who had his head up now , his face looking toward them , his hand cupped to his ear . As he looked Primitivo pointed up the mountain toward the highest country . " They are fighting at El Sordo 's , " Robert Jordan said . " Then let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Collect the people . Vamonos . " " No , " Robert Jordan said . " We stay here . "  |p295ROBERT  JORDAN looked up at where Primitivo stoacl now in hit lookout post , holding his rifle and pointing . He nodded his head but the man kept pointing , putting his hand to his ear and then pointing insistently and as though he could not possibly have been understood . " Do you stay with this gun and unless it is sure , sure , sure that they are coming in do not fire . And then not until they reach that shrub , " Robert Jordan pointed . " Do you understand ? " " Yes . But  --  " " No but . I will explain to thee later . I go to Primitivo . " Anselmo was by him and he said to the old man : " Viejo , stay there with Agustin with the gun . " He spoke slowly and unhurriedly . " He must not fire unless cavalry is actually entering . If they merely present themselves he must let them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hold the legs of the tripod firm for him and hand him the pans when they empty . " " Good , " the old man said . " And La Granja ? " " Later . " Robert Jordan climbed up , over and around the gray boulders that were wet now under his hands as he . pulled himself up . The sun was melting the snow on them fast . The tops of the boulders were drying and as he climbed he looked across the country and saw the pine woods and the long open glade and the dip of the country before the high mountains beyond . Then he stood beside Primitivo in a hollow behind two boulders and the short , brownfacedman said to him , " They are attacking Sordo . What is it that we do ? " " Nothing , " Robert Jordan said . He heard the firing clearly here and as he looked across the country , he saw , far off , across the distant valley where the country rose steeply again , a troop of cavalry ride out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the direction of the firing . He saw the oblong double line of men and horses dark against the snow as they forced at an angle up the hill . He watched the double line top the ridge and go into the farther timber . " We have to aid them , " Primitivo said . His voice was dry and flat . " It is impossible , " Robert Jordan told him . " I have expected this all morning . " " How ? " " They went to steal horses last night . The snow stopped and they tracked them up there . " " But we have to aid them , " Primitivo said . " We can not leave them alone to this . Those are our comrades . " Robert Jordan put his hand on the other man 's shoulder . " We can do nothing , " he said . " If we could I would do it . " " There is a way to reach there from above . We can take that way with the horses and the two guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them thus . " " Listen  --  " Robert Jordan said . " That is what I listen to , " Primitivo said . The firing was rolling in overlapping waves . Then they heard the noise of hand grenades heavy and sodden in the dry rolling of the automatic rifle fire . " They are lost , " Robert Jordan said . " They were lost when the snow stopped . If we go there we are lost , too . It is impossible to divide what force we have . " There was a gray stubble of beard stippled over Primitivo 's jaws , his lip and his neck . The rest of his face was flat brown with a broken , flattened nose and deep-set gray eyes , and watching him Robert Jordan saw the stubble twitching at the corners of his mouth and over the cords of his throat . " Listen to it , " he said . " It is a massacre . " " If they have surrounded the hollow it is that , " Robert Jordan said . " Some may have gotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take them from behind , " Primitivosaid . " Let four of us go with the horses . " " And then what ? What happens after you take them from behind ? " " We join with Sordo . " " To die there ? Look at the sun . The day is long . "  |p297The  sky was high and cloudless and the sun was hot on their backs . There were big bare patches now on the southern slope of the open glade below them and the snow was all dropped from the pine trees . The boulders below them that had been wet as the snow melted were steaming faintly now in the hot sun . " You have to stand it , " Robert Jordan said . " Hay que aguantarse . There are things like this in a war . " " But there is nothing we can do ? Truly ? " Primitivo looked at him and Robert Jordan knew he trusted him . " Thou couldst not send me and another with the small machine gun ? " " It would be useless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that he was looking for but it was a hawk that slid down into the wind and then rose above the line of the farthest pine woods . " It would be useless if we all went , " he said . Just then the firing doubled in intensity and in it was the heavy bumping of the hand grenades . " Oh , obscenity them , " Primitivo said with an absolute devoutnessof blasphemy , tears in his eyes and his cheeks twitching . " Oh , God and the Virgin , obscenity them in the milk of their filth . " " Calm thyself , " Robert Jordan said . " You will be fighting them soon enough . Here comes the woman . " Pilar was climbing up to them , making heavy going of it in the boulders . Primitivo kept saying , " Obscenity them . Oh , God and the Virgin , befoul them , " each time the firing rolled down the wind , and RobertJordan climbed down to help Pilar up . " Que. tal , woman , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbed heavily over the last boulder . " Thy binoculars , " she said and lifted their strap over her head . " So it has come to Sordo ? " " Yes . " " Pobre , " she said in commiseration . " Poor Sordo . " She was breathing heavily from the climb and she took hold of Robert Jordan 's hand and gripped it tight in hers as she looked out over the country . " How does the combat seem ? " " Bad . Very bad . "  | " He 's jodido ? " " I believe so . " " Pobre , " she said . " Doubtless because of the horses ? " " Probably . " " Pobre , " Pilar said . Then , " Rafael recounted me all of an entire novel of dung about cavalry . What came ? " " A patrol and part of a squadron . " " Up to what point ? " Robert Jordan pointed out where the patrol had stopped and showed her where the gun was hidden . From where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protruding from the rear of the blind . " The gypsy said they rode to where the gun muzzle pressed against the chest of the horse of the leader , " Pilar said . " What a race ! Thy glasses were in the cave . " " Have you packed ? " " All that can be taken . Is there news of Pablo ? " " He was forty minutes ahead of the cavalry . They took his trail . " Pilar grinned at him . She still held his hand . Now she dropped it . " They 'll never see him , " she said . " Now for Sordo . Can we do anything ? " " Nothing . " " Pobre , " she said . " I was very fond of Sordo . Thou art sure , sure that he is jodido ? " " Yes . I have seen much cavalry . " " More than were here ? " " Another full troop on their way up there . " " Listen to it , " Pilar said . " Pobre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Primitivo wanted to go up there , " Robert Jordan said . " Art thou crazy ? " Pilar said to the flat-faced man . " What kind of locos are we producing around here ? " " I wish to aid them . " " Que va , " Pilar said . " Another romantic . Dost thou not believe thou wilt die quick enough here without useless voyages ? " Robert Jordan looked at her , at the heavy brown face with the high Indian cheekbones , the wide-set dark eyes and the laughing mouth with the heavy , bitter upper lip.  | " Thou must act like a man , " she said to Primitivo . " A grown man . You with your gray hairs and all . " " Do n't joke at me , " Primitivo said sullenly . " If a man has a little heart and a little imagination " He should learn to control them , " Pilar said . " Thou wilt die soon enough with us . There is no need to seek that with strangers . As for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What a novel he told me . " " If thou hadst seen it thou wouldst not call it a novel , " Primitivo said . " There was a moment of great gravity . " " Que va , " Pilar said . " Some cavalry rode here and they rode away . And you all make yourselves a heroism . It is to this we have come with so much inaction . " " And this of Sordo is not grave ? " Primitivo said contemptuously now . He suffered visibly each time the firing came down the wind and he wanted either to go to the combat or have Pilar go and leave him alone . " Total , que ? " Pilar said . " It has come so it has come . Do n't lose thy cojones for the misfortune of another . " " Go defile thyself , " Primitivo said . " There are women of a stupidity and brutality that is insupportable . " " In order to support and aid those men poorly equipped for procreation , " Pilar said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just then Robert Jordan heard the plane high overhead . He looked up and in the high sky it looked to be the same observation plane that he had seen earlier in the morning . Now it was returning from the direction of the lines and it was moving in the direction of the high country where El Sordo was being attacked . " There is the bad luck bird , " Pilar said . " Will it see what goes on there ? " " Surely , " Robert Jordan said . " If they are not blind . " They watched the plane moving high and silvery and steady in the sunlight . It was coming from the left and they could see the round disks of light the two propellers made . " Keep down , " Robert Jordan said . Then the plane was overhead , its shadows passing over the open glade , the throbbing reaching its maximum of portent . Then it was past and headed toward the top of the valley . They watched it go steadily on its course until it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in a wide dipping circle , to circle twice over the high country and then disappear in the direction of Segovia . Robert Jordan looked at Pilar . There was perspiration on her forehead and she shook her head . She had been holding her lower lip between her teeth . " For each one there is something , " she said . " For me it is those . " " Thou hast not caught my fear ? " Primitivo said sarcastically . " Nay , " she put her hand on his shoulder . " Thou hast no fear to catch . I know that . I am sorry I joked too roughly with thee . We are all in the same caldron . " Then she spoke to Robert Jordan . " I will send up food and wine . Dost need anything more ? " " Not in this moment . Where are the others ? " " Thy reserve is intact below with the horses , " she grinned . " Everythingis out of sight . Everything to go is ready . Maria is with thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have aviation keep her in the cave . " " Yes , my Lord Ingles , " Pilar said . " Thy gypsy ( I give him to thee ) I have sent to gather mushrooms to cook with the hares . There are many mushrooms now and it seemed to me we might as well eat the hares although they would be better tomorrow or the day after . " " I think it is best to eat them , " Robert Jordan said , and Pilar put her big hand on his shoulder where the strap of the submachine gun crossed his chest , then reached up and mussed his hair with her fingers . " What an Ingles , " Pilar said . " I will send the Maria with the puchero when they are cooked . " The firing from far away and above had almost died out and now there was only an occasional shot . " You think it is over ? " Pilar asked . " No , " Robert Jordan said . " From the sound that we have heard they have attacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attackershave them surrounded . They have taken cover and they wait for the planes . " Pilar spoke to Primitivo , " Thou . Dost understand there was no intent to insult thee ? " " Ya lo se. , " said Primitivo . " I have put up with worse than that from thee . Thou hast a vile tongue . But watch thy mouth , woman . Sordo was a good comrade of mine . "  | " And not of mine ? " Pilar asked him . " Listen , flat face . In war one can not say what one feels . We have enough of our own without taking Sordo 's . " Primitivo was still sullen . " You should take a physic , " Pilar told him . " Now I go to prepare the meal . " " Did you bring the documentation of that requete ? " Robcrt Jordan asked her . " How stupid I am , " she said . " I forgot it . I will send the Maria . "  |p302IT  WAS three o'clock in the afternoon before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by noon and the rocks were hot now in the sun . There were no clouds in the sky and Robert Jordan sat in the rocks with his shirt off browning his back in the sun and reading the letters that had been in the pockets of the dead cavalryman . From time to time he would stop reading to look across the open slope to the line of the timber , look over the high country above and then return to the letters . No more cavalry had appeared . At intervalsthere would be the sound of a shot from the direction of El Sordo 's camp . But the firing was desultory . From examining his military papers he knew the boy was from Tafalla in Navarra , twenty-one years old , unmarried , and the son of a blacksmith . His regiment was the Nth cavalry , which surprised Robert Jordan , for he had believed that regiment to be in the North . He was a Carlist , and he had been wounded at the fighting for Irun at the start of the war . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulls at the Feria in Pamplona , Robert Jordan thought . You never kill any one that you want to kill in a war , he said to himself . Well , hardly ever , he amended and went on Leading the letters . The first letters he read were very formal , very carefully written and dealt almost entirely with local happenings . They were from his sister and Robert Jordan learned that everything was all right in Tafalla , that father was well , that mother was the same as always but with certain complaints about her back , that she hoped he was well and not in too great danger and she was happy he was doing away with the Reds to liberate Spain from the domination of the Marxist hordes . Then there was a list of those boys from Tafalla who had been killed or badly wounded since she wrote last . She mentioned ten who were killed . That is a great many for a town the size of Tafalla , Robert Jordan thought .  |p303There  was quite a lot of religion in the letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virgin of Pilar , and to other Virgins to protect him and she wanted him never to forget that he was also protected by the Sacred Heart of Jesus that he wore still , she trusted , at all times over his own heart where it had been proven innumerable  --  this was underlined  --  times to have the power of stopping bullets . She was as always his loving sister Concha . This letter was a little stained around the edges and Robert Jordanput it carefully back with the military papers and opened a letter with a less severe handwriting . It was from the boy 's novia , his fiancee , and it was quietly , formally , and completely hysterical with concern for his safety . Robert Jordan read it through and then put all the letters together with the papers into his hip pocket . He did not want to read the other letters . I guess I 've done my good deed for today , he said to himself . I guess you have all right , he repeated . " What are those you were reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letters of that requete we shot this morning . Do you want to see it ? " " I ca n't read , " Primitivo said . " Was there anything inter-esting ? " " No , " Robert Jordan told him . " They are personal letters . " " How are things going where he came from ? Can you tell from the letters ? " " They seem to be going all right , " Robert Jordan said . " There are many losses in his town . " He looked down to where the blind for the automatic rifle had been changed a little and improved after the snow melted . It looked convincing enough . He looked off across the country . " From what town is he ? " Primitivo asked . " Tafalla , " Robert Jordan told him . All right , he said to himself . I 'm sorry , if that does any good . It does n't , he said to himself . All right then , drop it , he said to himself . All right , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How many is that you have killed ? he asked himself . I do n't know . Do you think you have a right to kill any one ? No . But I have to . How many of those you have killed have been real fascists ? Very few . But they are all the enemy to whose force we are opposing force . But you like the people of Navarra better than those of any other part of Spain . Yes . And you kill them . Yes . If you do n't believe it go down there to the camp . Do n't you know it is wrong to kill ? Yes . But you do it ? Yes . And you still believe absolutely that your cause is right ? Yes . It is right , he told himself , not reassuringly , but proudly . I believe in the people and their right to govern themselves as they wish . But you must n't believe in killing , he told himself . You must do it as a necessity but you must not believe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is wrong . But how many do you suppose you have killed ? I do n't know because I wo n't keep track . But do you know ? Yes . How many ? You ca n't be sure how many . Blowing the trains you kill many . Very many . But you ca n't be sure . But of those you are sure of ? More than twenty . And of those how many were real fascists ? Two that I am sure of . Because I had to shoot them when we took them prisoners at Usera . And you did not mind that ? No . Nor did you like it ? No . I decided never to do it again . I have avoided it . I have avoided killing those who are unarmed . Listen , he told himself . You better cut this out . This is very bad for you and for your work . Then himself said back to him , You listen , see ? Because you are doing something very serious and I have to see you understand it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your head . Because if you are not absolutely straight in your head you have no right to do the things you do for all of them are crimes and no man has a right to take another man 's life unless it is to prevent something worse happening to other people . So get it straight and do not lie to yourself . But I wo n't keep a count of people I have killed as though it were a trophy record or a disgusting business like notches in a gun , he told himself . I have a right to not keep count and I have a right to forget them . No , himself said . You have no right to forget anything . You have no right to shut your eyes to any of it nor any right to forget any of it nor to soften it nor to change it . Shut up , he told himself . You 're getting awfully pompous . Nor ever to deceive yourself about it , himself went on.  |p305All  right , he told himself . Thanks for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love Maria ? Yes , himself said . Even if there is n't supposed to be any such thing as love in a purely materialistic conception of society ? Since when did you ever have any such conception ? himself asked . Never . And you never could have . You 're not a real Marxist and you know it . You believe in Liberty , Equality and Fraternity . You believe in Life , Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness . Do n't ever kid yourself with too much dialectics . They are for some but not for you . You have to know them in order not to be a sucker . You have put many things in abeyance to win a war . If this war is lost all of those things are lost . But afterwards you can discard what you do not believe in . There is plenty you do not believe in and plenty that you do believe in . And another thing . Do n't ever kid yourself about loving some one . It is just that most people are not lucky enough ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now you have it . What you have with Maria , whether it lasts just through today and a part of tomorrow , or whether it lasts for a long life is the most important thing that can happen to a human being . There will always be people who say it does not exist because they can not have it . But I tell you it is true and that you have it and that you are lucky even if you die tomorrow . Cut out the dying stuff , he said to himself . That 's not the way we talk . That 's the way our friends the anarchists talk . Whenever things get really bad they want to set fire to something and to die . It 's a very odd kind of mind they have . Very odd . Well , we 're getting through today , old timer , he told himself . It 's nearly Three o'clock now and there is going to be some food sooner or later . They are still shooting up at Sordo 's , which means that they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably . Though they have to make it before dark . I wonder what it is like up at Sordo 's . That 's what we all have to expect , given enough time . I imagine it is not too jovial up at Sordo 's . We certainly got Sordo into a fine jam with that horse business . How does it go in Spanish ? Un callejon sin salida . A passageway with no exit . I suppose I could go through with it all right . You only have to do it once and it is soon over with . But would n't it be luxury to fight in a war some time where , when you were surrounded , you could surrender ? . Estamos copados . We are surrounded . That was the great panic cry of this war . Then the next thing was that you were shot ; with nothing bad before if you were lucky . Sordo would n't be lucky that way . Neither would they when the time ever came . It was three o'clock . Then he heard the far-off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planes.  |p307EL  SoRno was making his fight on a hilltop . He did not like this hill and when he saw it he thought it had the shape of a chancre . But he had had no choice except this hill and he had picked it as far away as he could see it and galloped for it , the automatic rifle heavy on his back , the horse laboring , barrel heaving between his thighs , the sack of grenades swinging against one side , the sack of automatic rifle pans banging against the other , and Joaquin and Ignacio halting and firing , halting and firing to give him time to get the gun in place . There had still been snow then , the snow that had ruined them , and when his horse was hit so that he wheezed in a slow , jerking , climbing stagger up the last part of the crest , splattering the snow with a bright , pulsing jet , Sordo had hauled him along by the bridle , the reins over his shoulder as he climbed . He climbed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocks , with the two sacks heavy on his shoulders , and then , holding the horse by the mane , had shot him quickly , expertly , and tenderly just where he had needed him , so that the horse pitched , head forward down to plug a gap between two rocks . He had gotten the gun to firing over the horse 's back and he fired two pans , the gun clattering , the empty shells pitching into the snow , the smell of burnt hair from the burnt hide where the hot muzzle rested , him firing at what came up to the hill , forcing them to scatter for cover , while all the time there was a chill in his back from not knowing what was behind him . Once the last of the five men had reached the hilltop the chill went out of his back and he had saved the pans he had left until he would need them . There were two more horses dead along the slope and three more were dead here on the hilltop . He had only succeeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they tried to mount him bareback in the corral at the camp when the first shooting had started . Of the five men who had reached the hilltop three were wounded.  | Sordo was wounded in the calf of his leg and in two places in his left arm . He was very thirsty , his wounds had stiffened , and one of the wounds in his left arm was very painful . He also had a bad headache and as he lay waiting for the planes to come he thought of a joke in Spanish . It was , " Hay que tomar la muerte como si fuera aspiring , " which means , " You will have to take death as an aspirin . " But he did not make the joke aloud . He grinned somewhere inside the pain in his head and inside the nausea that came whenever he moved his arm and looked around at what there was left of his band . The five men were spread out like the points of a five-pointed star . They had dug with their knees and hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the dirt and piles of stones . Using this cover , they were linking the individual mounds up with stones and dirt . Joaquin , who was eighteen years old , had a steel helmet that he dug with and he passed dirt in it . He had gotten this helmet at the blowing up of the train . It had a bullet hole through it and every one had always joked at him for keeping it . But he had hammered the jagged edges of the bullet hole smooth and driven a wooden plug into it and then cut the plug off and smoothed it even with the metal inside the helmet . When the shooting started he had clapped this helmet on his head so hard it banged his head as though he had been hit with a casseroleand , in the last lung-aching , leg-dead , mouth-dry , bullet-spatting , bullet-cracking , bullet-singing run up the final slope of the hill after his horse was killed , the helmet had seemed to weigh a great amount and to ring his bursting forehead with an iron band . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in a steady , almost machinelike desperation . He had not yet been hit . " It serves for something finally , " Sordo said to him in his deep . hroaty voice . " Resistir y f orti ficar es venter , " Joaquin said , his mouth stiff with the dryness of fear which surpassed the normal thirst of battle . It was one of the slogans of the Communist party and it meant , " Hold out and fortify , and you will win . " Sordo looked away and down the slope at where a cavalryman was sniping from behind a boulder , He was very fond of this boy and he was in no mood for slogans . " What d ; d you say ? "  |p309One  of the men turned from the building that he was doing . This man was lying flat on his face , reaching carefully up with his hands to put a rock in place while keeping his chin flat against the ground , Joaquin repeated the slogan in his dried-up boy 's voice without checking his digging for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the man with his chin on the ground asked . " Venter , " the boy said . " Win . " " Mierda , " the man with his chin on the ground said . " There is another that applies to here , " Joaquin said , bringing them out as though they were talismans , " Pasionaria says it is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees . " " Mierda again , " the man said and another man said , over his shoulder , " We 're on our bellies , not our knees . " " Thou . Communist . Do you know your Pasionaria has a son thy age in Russia since the start of the movement ? " " It 's a lie , " Joaquin said . " Que va , it 's a lie , " the other said . " The dynamiter with the rare name told me . He was of thy party , too . Why should he lie ? " " It 's a lie , " Joaquin said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son hidden in Russia out of the war . " " I wish I were in Russia , " another of Sordo 's men said . " Will not thy Pasionaria send me now from here to Russia , Communist ? " " If thou believest so much in thy Pasionaria , get her to get us off this hill , " one of the men who had a bandaged thigh said . " The fascists will do that , " the man with his chin in the dirt said . " Do not speak thus , " Joaquin said to him . " Wipe the pap of your mother 's breasts off thy lips and give me a hatful of that dirt , " the man with his chin on the ground said . " No one of us will see the sun go down this night . " El Sordo was thinking : It is shaped like a chancre . Or the breast of a young girl with no nipple . Or the top cone of a volcano . You have never seen a volcano , he thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is like a chancre . Let the volcanos alone . It 's late now for the volcanos . He looked very carefully around the withers of the dead horse and there was a quick hammering of firing from behind a boulder well down the slope and he heard the bullets from the submachine gun thud into the horse . He crawled along behind the horse and looked out of the angle between the horse 's hindquarters and the rock . There were three bodies on the slope just below him where they had fallen when the fascists had rushed the crest under cover of the automatic rifle and submachine gunfire and he and the others had broken down the attack by throwing and rolling down hand grenades . There were other bodies that he could not see on the other sides of the hill crest . There was no dead ground by which attackers could approach the summit and Sordo knew that as long as his ammunitionand grenades held out and he had as many as four men they could not get him out of there unless they brought up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent to La Granja for a trench mortar . Perhaps they had not , because surely , soon , the planes would come . It had been four hours since the observation plane had flown over them . This hill is truly like a chancre , Sordo thought , and we are the very pus of it . But we killed many when they made that stupidness . How could they think that they would take us thus ? They have such modern armament that they lose all their sense with overconfidence . He had killed the young officer who had led the assault with a grenade that had gone bouncing and rolling down the slope as they came up it , running , bent half over . In the yellow flash and gray roar of smoke he had seen the officer dive forward to where he lay now like a heavy , broken bundle of old clothing marking the farthest point that the assault had reached . Sordo looked at this body and then , down the hill , at the others . They are brave but stupid people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attack us again until the planes come . Unless , of course , they have a mortar coming . It would be easy with a mortar . The mortar was the normal thing and he knew that they would die as soon as a mortar came up , but when he thought of the planes coming up he felt as naked on that hilltop as though all of his clothing and even his skin had been removed . There is no nakeder thing than I feel , he thought . A flayed rabbit is as well covered as a bear in comparison . But why should they bring planes ? They could get us out of here with a trench mortar easily . They are proud of their planes , though , and they will probably bring them . Just ar they were so proud of their automatic weapons that they made thatp311stupidness . But undoubtedly they must have sent for a mortar , too . One of the men fired . Then jerked the bolt and fired again , quickly . " Save thy cartridges , " Sordo said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to reach that boulder , " the man pointed . " Did you hit him ? " Sordo asked , turning his head with difficulty . " Nay , " the man said . " The fornicator ducked back . " " Who is a whore of whores is Pilar , " the man with his chin in the dirt said . " That whore knows we are dying here . " " She could do no good , " Sordo said . The man had spoken on the side of his good ear and he had heard him without turning his head . " What could she do ? " " Take these sluts from the rear . " " Que. va , " Sordo said . " They are spread around a hillside . How would she come on them ? There are a hundred and fifty of them . Maybe more now . " " But if we hold out until dark , " Joaquin said . " And if Christmas comes on Easter , " the man with his chin on the ground said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy uncle , " another said to him . " Send for thy Pasionaria . She alone can help us . " " I do not believe that about the son , " Joaquin said . " Or if he is there he is training to be an aviator or something of that sort . " " He is hidden there for safety , " the man told him . " He is studying dialectics . Thy Pasionaria has been there . So have Lister and Modesto and others . The one with the rare name told me . " " That they should go to study and return to aid us , " Joaquin said . " That they should aid us now , " another man said . " That all the cruts of Russian sucking swindlers should aid us now . " He fired and said , " Me cago en tal ; I missed him again . " " Save thy cartridges and do not talk so much or thou wilt be very thirsty , " Sordo said . " There is no water on this hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rolling on his side he pulled a wineskinthat he wore slung from his shoulder over his head and handed it to Sordo . " Wash thy mouth out , old one . Thou must have much thirst with thy wounds . " " Let all take it , " Sordo said.  | " Then I will have some first , " the owner said and squirted a long stream into his mouth before he handed the leather bottle around . " Sordo , when thinkest thou the planes will come ? " the man with his chin in the dirt asked . " Any time , " said Sordo . " They should have come before . " " Do you think these sons of the great whore will attack again ? " " Only if the planes do not come . " He did not think there was any need to speak about the mortar . ' I hey would know it soon enough when the mortar came . " God knows they 've enough planes with what we saw yesterday . ' ' " Too many , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm was stiffening so that the pain of moving it was almost unbearable . He looked up at the bright , high , blue early summer sky as he raised the leather wine bottle with his good arm . He was fifty-two years old and he was sure this was the last time he would see that sky . He was not at all afraid of dying but he was angry at being trapped on this hill which was only utilizable as a place to die . If we could have gotten clear , he thought . If we could have made them come up the long valley or if we could have broken loose across the road it would have been all right . But this chancre of a hill . We must use it as well as we can and we have used it very well so far . If he had known how many men in history have had to use a hill to die on it would not have cheered him any for , in the moment he was passing through , men are not impressed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a widow of one day is helped by the knowledge that other loved husbands have died . Whether one has fear of it or not , one 's death is difficult to accept . Sordo had accepted it but there was no sweetness in its . acceptance even at fifty-two , with three wounds and him surrounded on a hill . He joked about it to himself but he looked at the sky and at the far mountains and he swallowed the wine and he did not want it . If one must die , he thought , and clearly one must , I can die . But I hate it . Dying was nothing and he had no picture of it nor fear of it in his mind . But living was a field of grain blowing in the wind on the side of a hill . Living was a hawk in the sky . Living was anp313earthen jar of water in the dust of the threshing with the grain flailed out and the chaff blowing . Living was a horse between your legs and a carbine under one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with trees along it and the far side of the valley and the hills beyond . Sordo passed the wine bottle back and nodded his head in thanks , He leaned forward and patted the dead horse on the shoulder where the muzzle of the automatic rifle had burned the hide . He could still smell the burnt hair . He thought how he had held the horse there , trembling , with the fire around them , whispering and cracking , over and around them . like a curtain , and had carefully shot him just at the intersection of the cross-lines between the two eyes and the ears . Then as the horse pitched down he had dropped down behind his warm , wet back to get the gun to going as they came up the hill . " Eras mucho caballo , " he said , meaning , " Thou wert plenty of horse . " El Sordo lay now on his good side and looked up at the sky . He was lying on a heap of empty cartridge hulls but his head was protected by the rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His wounds had stiffened badly and he had much pain and he felt too tired to move . " What passes with thee , old one ? " the man next to him asked . " Nothing . I am taking a little rest . " " Sleep , " the other said . " They will wake us when they come . " Just then some one shouted from down the slope . " Listen , bandits ! " the voice came from behind the rocks where the closest automatic rifle was placed . " Surrender now before the planes blow you to pieces . " " What is it he says ? " Sordo asked . Joaquin told him . Sordo rolled to one side and pulled himself up so that he was crouched behind the gun again . " Maybe the planes are n't coming , " he said . " Do n't answer them and do not fire . Maybe we can get them to attack again . " " If we should insult them a little ? " the man who had spoken to Joaquin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , " Sordo said . " Give me thy big pistol . Who has a big pistol ? ' " Here . " " Give it to me . " Crouched on his knees he took the big 9 mm ,  | Star and fired one shot into the ground beside the dead horse , waited , then fired again four times at irregular intervals . Then he waited while he counted sixty and then fired a final shot directly into the body of the dead horse . He grinned and handed back the pistol . " Reload it , " he whispered , " and that every one should keep his mouth shut and no one shoot . " " Bandidos ! " the voice shouted from behind the rocks . No one spoke on the hill . " Bandidos ! Surrender now before we blow thee to little pieces . " " They 're biting , " Sordo whispered happily . As he watched , a man showed his head over the top of the rocks . There was no shot from the hilltop and the head went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing more happened . He turned his head and looked at the others who were all watching down their sectors of the slope . As he looked at them the others shook their heads . " Let no one move , " he whispered . " Sons of the great whore , " the voice came now from behind the rocks again . " Red swine . Mother rapers . Eaters of the milk of thy fathers . " Sordo grinned . He could just hear the bellowed insults by turning his good ear . This is better than the aspirin , he thought . How many will we get ? Can they be that foolish ? The voice had stopped again and for three minutes they heard nothing and saw no movement . Then the sniper behind the boulder a hundred yards down the slope exposed himself and fired . The bullet hit a rock and ricocheted with a sharp whine . Then Sordo saw a man , bent double , run from the shelter of the rocks where the automatic rifle was across the open ground to the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dove behind the boulder . Sordo looked around . They signalled to him that there was no movement on the other slopes . El Sordo grinned happily and shook his head . This is ten times better than the aspirin , he thought , and he waited , as happy as only a hunter can be happy . Below on the slope the man who had run from the pile of stoner to the shelter of the boulder was speaking to the sniper . " Do you believe it ? "  | " I do n't know , " the sniper said . " It would be logical , " the man , who was the officer in command , said . " They are surrounded . They have nothing to expect but to die . " The sniper said nothing . " What do you think ? " the officer asked . " Nothing , " the sniper said . " Have you seen any movement since the shots ? " " None at all . " The officer looked at his wrist watch . It was ten minutes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour ago , " he said . Just then another officer flopped in behind the boulder . The sniper moved over to make room for him . " Thou , Paco , " the first officer said . " How does it seem to thee ? " The second officer was breathing heavily from his sprint up and across the hillside from the automatic rifle position . " For me it is a trick , " he said . " But if it is not ? What a ridicule we make waiting here and laying siege to dead men . " " We have done something worse than ridiculous already , " the second officer said . " Look at that slope . " He looked up the slope to where the dead were scattered close to the top . From where he looked the line of the hilltop showed the scattered rocks , the belly , projecting legs , shod hooves jutting out , of Sordo 's horse , and the fresh dirt thrown up by the digging . " What about the mortars ? " asked the second officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If not before . " " Then wait for them . There has been enough stupidity already . " " Bandidos ! " the first officer shouted suddenly , getting to his feet and putting his head well up above the boulder so that the crest of the hill looked much closer as he stood upright . " Red swine ! Cow-ards ! " The second officer looked at the sniper and shook his head . The sniper looked away but his lips tightened . The first officer stood there , his head all clear of the rock and with his hand on his pistol butt . He cursed and vilified the hilltop . Nothinghappened . Then he stepped clear of the boulder and stood there looking up the hill.  | " Fire , cowards , if you are alive , " he shouted . " Fire on one who has no fear of any Red that ever came out of the belly of the great whore . " This last was quite a long sentence to shout and the officer 's face was red and congested as he finished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with quiet eyes , a thin , long-lipped mouth and a stubble of beard over his hollowcheeks , shook his head again . It was this officer who was shoutingwho had ordered the first assault . The young lieutenant who was dead up the slope had been the best friend of this other lieutenant who was named Paco Berrendo and who was listening to the shouting of the captain , who was obviously in a state of exaltation . " Those are the swine who shot my sister and my mother , " the captain said . He had a red face and a blond , British-looking moustacheand there was something wrong about his eyes . They were a light blue and the lashes were light , too . As you looked at them they seemed to focus slowly . Then " Reds , " he shouted . " Cowards ! " and commenced cursing again . He stood absolutely clear now and , sighting carefully , fired his pistol at the only target that the hilltop presented : the dead horse that had belonged to Sordo . The bullet threw up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain fired again . The bullet hit a rock and sung off . The captain stood there looking at the hilltop . The Lieutenant Berrendo was looking at the body of the other lieutenant just below the summit . The sniper was looking at the ground under his eyes . Then he looked up at the captain . " There is no one alive up there , " the captain said . " Thou , " he said to the sniper , " go up there and see . " The sniper looked down . He said nothing . " Do n't you hear me ? " the captain shouted at him . " Yes , my captain , " the sniper said , not looking at him . " Then get up and go . " The captain still had his pistol out . " Do you hear me ? " " Yes , my captain . " " Why do n't you go , then ? " " I do n't want to , my captain . "  | " You do n't want to ? " The captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . " You do n't want to ? " " I am afraid , my captain , " the soldier said with dignity . Lieutenant Berrendo , watching the captain 's face and his odd eyes , thought he was going to shoot the man then . " Captain Mora , " he said . " Lieutenant Berrendo ? " " It is possible the soldier is right " " That he is right to say he is afraid ? That he is right to say he does not want to obey an order ? " " No . That he is right that it is a trick . " " They are all dead , " the captain said . " Do n't you hear me say they are all dead ? " " You mean our comrades on the slope ? " Berrendo asked him . " I agree with you . " " Paco , " the captain said , " do n't be a fool . Do you think you are the only one who cared for Julian ? I tell you the Reds are dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both hands on top of the boulder and pulled himself up , kneeing-up awkwardly , then getting on his feet . " Shoot , " he shouted , standing on the gray granite boulder and waved both his arms . " Shoot me ! Kill me ! " On the hilltop El Sordo lay behind the dead horse and grinned . What a people , he thought . He laughed , trying to hold it in because the shaking hurt his arm . " Reds , " came the shout from below . " Red canaille . Shoot me ! Kill me ! " Sordo , his chest shaking , barely peeped past the horse 's crupper and saw the captain on top of the boulder waving his arms . Anotherofficer stood by the boulder . The sniper was standing at the other side . Sordo kept his eye where it was and shook his head happily . " Shoot me , " he said softly to himself . " Kill me ! " Then his shouldersshook again . The laughing hurt his arm and each time he laughed his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook him again like a spasm . Captain Mora got down from the boulder . " Now do you believe me , Paco ? " he questioned Lieutenant Berrendo.  | " No , " said Lieutenant Berrendo . " Cojones ! " the captain said . " Here there is nothing but idiots and cowards . " The sniper had gotten carefully behind the boulder again and Lieutenant Berrendo was squatting beside him . The captain , standing in the open beside the boulder , commenced to shout filth at the hilltop . There is no language so filthy as Spanish . There are words for all the vile words in English and there are other words and expressions that are used only in countries where blasphemy keeps pace with the austerity of religion . Lieutenant Berrendo was a very devout Catholic . So was the sniper . They were Carlists from Navarra and while both of them cursed and blasphemedwhen they were angry they regarded it as a sin which they regularly confessed . As they crouched now behind the boulder watching the captain and listening to what he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was saying . They did not want to have that sort of talk on their consciences on a day in which they might die . Talking thus will not bring luck , the sniper thought . Speaking thus of the Virgen is bad luck . This one speaks worse than the Reds . Julian is dead , Lieutenant Berrendo was thinking . Dead there on the slope on such a day as this is . And this foul mouth stands there bringing more ill fortune with his blasphemies . Now the captain stopped shouting and turned to Lieutenant Berrendo . His eyes looked stranger than ever . " Paco , " he said , happily , " you and I will go up there . " " Not me . " " What ? " The captain had his pistol out again . I hate these pistol brandishers , Berrendo was thinking . They cannotgive an order without jerking a gun out . They probably will go if you order me to . But under protest , " Lieutenant Berrendo told the captain . " Then I will go alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too strong here . " Holding his pistol in his right hand , he strode steadily up the slept Berrendo and the sniper watched him . He was making nop319attempt to take any cover and he was looking straight ahead of him at the rocks , the dead horse , and the fresh-dug dirt of the hilltop . El Sordo lay behind the horse at the corner of the rock , watching the captain come striding up the hill . Only one , he thought . We get only one . But from his manner of speaking he is caza mayor . Look at him walking . Look what an animal . Look at him stride forward . This one is for me . This one I take with me on the trip . This one coming now makes the same voyage I do . Come on , Comrade Voyager . Come striding . Come right along . Come along to meet it . Come on . Keep on walking . Do n't slow up . Come right along . Come as thou art coming . Do n't stop and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even look down . Keep on coming with your eyes forward . Look , he has a moustache . What do you think of that ? He runs to a moustache , the Comrade Voyager . He is a captain . Look at his sleeves . I said he was caza mayor . He has the face of an Inglcs . Look . With a red face and blond hair and blue eyes . With no cap on and his moustache is yellow . With blue eyes . With pale blue eyes . With pale blue eyes with something wrong with them . With pale blue eyes that do n't focus . Close enough . Too close . Yes , Comrade Voyager . Take it , Comrade Voyager . He squeezed the trigger of the automatic rifle gently and it pounded back three times against his shoulder with the slippery jolt the recoil of a tripoded automatic weapon gives . The captain lay on his face on the hillside . His left arm was under him . His right arm that had held the pistol was stretched forward of his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hill crest again . Crouched behind the boulder , thinking that now he would have to sprint across that open space under fire , Lieutenant Berrendo heard the deep hoarse voice of Sordo from the hilltop . " Bandidos ! " the voice came . " Bandidos ! Shoot me ! Kill me ! " On the top of the hill El Sordo lay behind the automatic rifle laughing so that his chest ached , so that he thought the top of his head would burst . " Bandidos , " he shouted again happily . " Kill me , bandidos ! " Then he shook his head happily . We have lots of company for the Voyage , he thought . He was going to try for the other officer with the automatic rifle when he would leave the shelter of the boulder . Sooner or later he would have to leave it . Sordo knew that he could never command from there and he thought he had a very good chance to get him . Just then the others on the hill heard the first sound of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . He was covering the down-slope edge of the boulder with his automatic rifle and he was thinking : when I see him he will be running already and I will miss him if I am not careful . I could shoot behind him all across that stretch . I should swing the gun with him and ahead of him . Or let him start and then get on him and ahead of him . I will try to pick him up there at the edge of the rock and swing just ahead of him . Then he felt a touch on his shoulder and he turned and saw the gray , fear-drained face of Joaquin and he looked where the boy was pointing and saw the three planes coming . At this moment Lieutenant Berrendo broke from behind the boulderand , with his head bent and his legs plunging , ran down and across the slope to the shelter of the rocks where the automatic rifle was placed . Watching the planes , Sordo never saw him go . " Help me to pull this out , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear from between the horse and the rock . The planes were coming on steadily . They were in echelon and each second they grew larger and their noise was greater . " Lie on your backs to fire at them , " Sordo said . " Fire ahead of them as they come . " He was watching them all the time . " Cabrones ! Hijos de puta ! " he said rapidly . " Ignacio ! " he said . " Put the gun on the shoulder of the boy . Thou ! " to Joaquin , " Sit there and do not move . Crouch over . More . No . More . " He lay back and sighted with the automatic rifle as the planes came on steadily . " Thou , Ignacio , hold me the three legs of that tripod . " They were dangling down the boy 's back and the muzzle of the gun was shakingfrom the jerking of his body that Joaquin could not control as he crouched with bent head hearing the droning roar of their coming . Lying flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themp321come , Ignacio gathered the legs of the tripod into his two hands and steadied the gun . " Keep thy head down , " he said to Joaquin . " Keep thy head for-ward . " " Pasionaria says Better to die on thy  --  ' " Joaquin was saying to himself as the drone came nearer them . Then he shifted suddenly into " Hail Mary , full of grace , the Lord is with thee ; Blessed art thou among women and Blessed is the fruit of thy womb , Jesus . Holy Mary , Mother of God , pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death . Amen . Holy Mary , Mother of God , " he started , then he remembered quickly as the roar came now unbearably and started an act of contrition racing in it , " Oh my God , I am heartily sorry for having offended thee who art worthy of all my love  --  " Then there were the hammering explosions past his ears and the gun barrel hot against his shoulder . It was hammering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blast . Ignacio was pullingdown hard on the tripod and the barrel was burning his back . It was hammering now in the roar and he could not remember the act of contrition . All he could remember was at the hour of our death . Amen . At the hour of our death . Amen . At the hour . At the hour . Amen . The ethers all were firing . Now and at the hour of our death . Amen . Then , through the hammering of the gun , there was the whistle of the air splitting apart and then in the red black roar the earth rolled under his knees and then waved up to hit him in the face and then dirt and bits of rock were falling all over and Ignacio was lying on him and the gun was lying on him . But he was not dead because the whistle came again and the earth rolled under him with the roar . Then it came again and the earth lurched under his belly and one side of the hilltop rose into the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The planes came back three times and bombed the hilltop but no one on the hilltop knew it . Then the planes machine-gunned the hilltop and went away . As they dove on the hill for the last time with their machine guns hammering , the first plane pulled up and winged over and then each plane did the same and they moved from echelon to V-formation and went away into the sky in the direction of Segovia.  | Keeping a heavy fire on the hilltop , Lieutenant Berrendo pushed a patrol up to one of the bomb craters from where they could throw grenades onto the crest . He was taking no chances of any one being alive and waiting for them in the mess that was up there and he threw four grenades into the confusion of dead horses , broken and split rocks , and torn yellow-stained explosive-stinking earth before he climbed out of the bomb crater and walked over to have a look . No one was alive on the hilltop except the boy Joaquin , who was unconscious under the dead body of Ignacio . Joaquin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had known nothing and had no feeling since he had suddenly been in the very heart of the thunderand the breath had been wrenched from his body when the one bomb struck so close and Lieutenant Berrendo made the sign of the cross and then shot him in the back of the head , as quickly and as gently , if such an abrupt movement can be gentle , as Sordo had shot the wounded horse . Lieutenant Berrendo stood on the hilltop and looked down the slope at his own dead and then across the country seeing where they had galloped before Sordo had turned at bay here . He noticed all the dispositions that had been made of the troops and then he ordered the dead men 's horses to be brought up and the bodies tied across the saddles so that they might be packed in to La Granja . " Take that one , too , " he said . " The one with his hands on the automatic rifle . That should be Sordo . He is the oldest and it was he with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in a poncho . " He considered a minute . " You might as well take all the heads . And of the others below on the slope and where we first found them . Collectthe rifles and pistols and pack that gun on a horse . " Then he walked down to where the lieutenant lay who had been . killed in the first assault . He looked down at him but did not touch " Que cosa ma 's mala es in guerra , " he said to himself , which meant , " What a bad thing war is . " Then he made the sign of the cross again and as he walked down the hill he said five Our Fathers and five Hail Marys for the repose of the soul of his dead comrade . He did not wish to stay to see his Drders being carried out.  |p323AFTER  the planes went away Robert Jordan and Primitivo heard the firing start and his heart seemed to start again with it . A cloud of smoke drifted over the last ridge that he could see in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specks in the sky . " They 've probably bombed hell out of their own cavalry and never touched Sordo and Company , " Robert Jordan said to himself . " The damned planes scare you to death but they do n't kill you . " " The combat goes on , " Primitivo said , listening to the heavy firing . He had winced at each bomb thud and now he licked his dry lips . " Why not ? " Robert Jordan said . " Those things never kill any-body . " Then the firing stopped absolutely and he did not hear another shot . Lieutenant Berrendo 's pistol shot did not carry that far . When the firing first stopped it did not affect him . Then as the quiet kept on a hollow feeling came in his chest . Then he heard the grenades burst and for a moment his heart rose . Then everything was quiet again and the quiet kept on and he knew that it was over . Maria came up from the camp with a tin bucket of stewed hare with mushrooms sunken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a leather wine bottle , four tin plates , two cups and four spoons . She stopped at the gun and ladled out two plates for Agustin and Eladio , who had replaced Anselmo at the gun , and gave them bread and unscrewed the horn tip of the wine bottle and poured two cups of wine . Robert Jordan watched her climbing lithely up to his lookout post , the sack over her shoulder , the bucket in one hand , her cropped head bright in the sun . He climbed down and took the bucket and helped her up the last boulder . " What did the aviation do ? " she asked , her eyes frightened.  | " Bombed Sordo . " He had the bucket open and was ladling out stew onto a plate . " Are they still fighting ? " " No . It is over . " " Oh , " she said and bit her lip and looked out across the country . " I have no appetite , " Primitivo said . " Eat anyway , " Robert Jordan told him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drink of this , man , " Robert Jordan said and handed him the wine bottle . " Then eat . " " This of Sordo has taken away desire , " Primitivo said . " Eat , thou . I have no desire . " Maria went over to him and put her arms around his neck and kissed him . " Eat , old one , " she said . " Each one should take care of his strength . " Primitivo turned away from her . He took the wine bottle and tipping his head back swallowed steadily while he squirted a jet of wine into the back of his mouth . Then he filled his plate from the bucket and commenced to eat . Robert Jordan looked at Maria and shook his head . She sat down by him and put her arm around his shoulder . Each knew how the other felt and they sat there and Robert Jordan ate the stew , taking time to appreciate the mushrooms completely , and he drank the wine and they said nothing . " You may stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said after a while when the food was all eaten . " Nay , " she said . " I must go to Pilar . " " It is all right to stay here . I do not think that anything will happennow . " " Nay . I must go to Pilar . She is giving me instruction . " " What does she give thee ? " " Instruction . " She smiled at him and then kissed him . " Did you never hear of religious instruction ? " She blushed . " It is something like that . " She blushed again . " But different . " " Go to thy instruction , " he said and patted her on the head . She smiled at him again , then said to Primitivo , " Do you want any thing from below ? "  | " No , daughter , " he said . They both saw that he was still not yet recovered . " Salud , old one , " she said to him . " Listen , " Primitivo said . " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " his voice broke . " There was no choice , " Robert Jordan told him . " I know . But all the same . " " There was no choice , " Robert Jordan repeated . " And now it is better not to speak of it . " " Yes . But there alone with no aid from us ' . ' " Much better not to speak of it , " Robert Jordan said . " And thou , guapa , get thee to thy instruction . " He watched her climb down through the rocks . Then he sat there for a long time thinking and watching the high country . Primitivo spoke to him but he did not answer . It was hot in the sun but he did not notice the heat while he sat watching the hill slopes and the long patches of pine trees that stretched up the highestslope . An hour passed and the sun was far to his left now when he saw them coming over the crest of the slope and he picked up his glasses . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came into sight on the long green slope of the high hill . Then there were four more horsemen coming down , spread out across the wide hill and then through his glasses he saw the double column of men and horses ride into the sharp clarity of his vision . As he watched them he felt sweat come from his armpits and run down his flanks . One man rode at the head of the column . Then came more horsemen . Then came the riderless horses with their burdens tied across the saddles . Then there were two riders . Then came the wounded with men walking by them as they rode . Then came more cavalry to close the column . Robert Jordan watched them ride down the slope and out of sight into the timber . He could not see at that distance the load one saddle bore of a long rolled poncho tied at each end and at intervals so that it bulged between each lashing as a pod bulges with peas . This was tied across the saddle and at each end it was lashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the saddle the automatic rifle Sordo had served was lashed arrogantly.  | Lieutenant Berrendo , who was riding at the head of the column , his flankers out , his point pushed well forward , felt no arrogance . He felt only the hollowness that comes after action . He was thinking : taking the heads is barbarous . But proof and identification is necessary . I will have trouble enough about this as it is and who knows ? This of the heads may appeal to them . There are those of them who like such things . It is possible they will send them all to Burgos . It is a barbarous business . The planes were anuchos . Much . Much . But we could have done it all , and almost without losses , with a Stokes mortar . Two mules to carry the shells and a mule with a mortar on each side of the pack saddle . What an army we would be then ! With the fire power of all these automatic weapons . And another mule . No , two mules to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is no longer cavalry . Leave it alone . You 're building yourself an army . Next you will want a mountain gun . Then he thought of Julian , dead on the hill , dead now , tied across a horse there in the first troop , and as he rode down into the dark pine forest , leaving the sunlight behind him on the hill , riding now in the quiet dark of the forest , he started to say a prayer for him again . " Hail , holy queen mother of mercy , " he started . " Our life , our sweetness and our hope . To thee do we send up our sighs , mourningsand weepings in this valley of tears He went on with the prayer , the horses ' hooves soft on the fallen pine needles , the light coming through the tree trunks in patches as it comes through the columns of a cathedral , and as he prayed he looked ahead to see his flankers riding through the trees . He rode out of the forest onto the yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' hooves raised a dust that hung over them as they rode . It powdered the dead who were tied face down across the saddles and the wounded , and those who walked beside them , were in thick dust . It was here that Anselmo saw them ride past in their dust . He counted the dead and the wounded and he recognized Sordo 's automatic rifle . He did not know what the poncho-wrapped bundle was which flapped against the led horse 's flanks as the stirrup leathersswung but when , on his way home , he came in the dark ontop327the hill where Sordo had fought , he knew at once what the long poncho roll contained . In the dark he could not tell who had been up on the hill . But he counted those that lay there and then made off across the hills for Pablo 's camp . Walking alone in the dark , with a fear like a freezing of his . heart from the feeling the holes of the bomb craters had given him , from them and from what he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next day out of his mind . He simply walked as fast as he could to bring the news . And as he walked he prayed for the souls of Sordo and of all his band . It was the first time he had prayed since the start of the movement . " Most kind , most sweet , most clement Virgin , " he prayed . But he could not keep from thinking of the next day finally . So he thought : I will do exactly as the Ingles says and as he says to do it . But let me be close to him , 0 Lord , and may his instructions be exact for I do not think that I could control myself under the bombardment of the planes . Help me , 0 Lord , tomorrow to comport myself as a man should in his last hours . Help me , 0 Lord , to understandclearly the needs of the day . Help me , 0 Lord , to dominate the movement of my legs that I should not run when the bad moment comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a man tomorrow in the day of battle . Since I have asked this aid of thee , please grant it , knowing I would not ask it if it were not serious , and I will ask nothing more of thee again . Walking in the dark alone he felt much better from having prayed and he was sure , now , that he would comport himself well . Walking now down from the high country , he went back to praying for the people of Sordo and in a short time he had reached the upper post where Fernando challenged him . " It is I , " he answered , " Anselmo . " " Good , " Fernando said . " You know of this of Sordo , old one ? " Anselmo asked Fernando , the two of them standing at the entrance of the big rocks in the dark . " Why not ? " Fernando said . " Pablo has told us . " " He was up there ? " " Why not ? " Fernando said stolidly . " He visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " He told you  --  " " He told us all , " Fernando said . " What barbarians these fascists are ! We must do away with all such barbarians in Spain . " He stopped , then said bitterly , " In them is lacking all conception of dig-nity . " ' Anselmo grinned in the dark . An hour ago he could not have imagined that he would ever smile again . What a marvel , that Fernando , he thought . " Yes , " he said to Fernando . " We must teach them . We must take away their planes , their automatic weapons , their tanks , their artilleryand teach them dignity . " " Exactly , " Fernando said . " I am glad that you agree . " Anselmo left him standing there alone with his dignity and went on down to the cave.  |p329ANSELMO  found Robert Jordan sitting at the plank table inside the cave with Pablo opposite him . They had a bowl poured full of wine between them and each had a cup of wine on the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding a pencil . Pilar and Maria were in the back of the cave out of sight . There was no way for Anselmo to know that the woman was keeping the girl back there to keep her from hearing the conversation and he thought that it was odd that Pilar was not at the table . Robert Jordan looked up as Anselmo came in under the blanket that hung over the opening . Pablo stared straight at the table . His eyes were focused on the wine bowl but he was not seeing it . " I come from above , " Anselmo said to Robert Jordan . " Pablo has told us , " Robert Jordan said . " There were six dead on the hill and they had taken the heads , " Anselmo said . " I was there in the dark . " Robert Jordan nodded . Pablo sat there looking at the wine bowl and saying nothing . There was no expression on his face and his small pig-eyes were looking at the wine bowl as though he had never seen one before . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old man sat down at the table on one of the hide-covered stools and Robert Jordan reached under the table and brought up the pinch-bottle of whiskey that had been the gift of Sordo . It was about half-full . Robert Jordan reached down the table for a cup and poured a drink of whiskey into it and shoved it along the table to Anselmo . " Drink that , old one , " he said . Pablo looked from the wine bowl to Anselmo 's face as he drank and then he looked back at the wine bowl . As Anselmo swallowed the whiskey he felt a burning in his nose , his eyes and his mouth , and then a happy , comforting warmth in his stomach . He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand . Then he looked at Robert Jordan and said , " Can I have another ? "  | " Why not ? " Robert Jordan said and poured another drink from the bottle and handed it this time instead of pushing it . This time there was not the burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as good a thing for his spirit as a saline injection is for a man who has suffered a great hemorrhage . The old man looked toward the bottle again . " The rest is for tomorrow , " Robert Jordan said . " What passed on the road , old one ? " " There was much movement , " Anselmo said . " I have it all noted down as you showed me . I have one watching for me and noting now . Later I will go for her report . " " Did you see anti-tank guns ? Those on rubber tires with the long barrels ? " " Yes , " Anselmo said . " There were four camions which passed on the road . In each of them there was such a gun with pine branches spread across the barrels . In the trucks rode six men with each gun . " " Four guns , you say ? " Robert Jordan asked him . " Four , " Anselmo said . He did not look at his papers . " Tell me what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted Anselmo told him everything he had seen move past him on the road . He told it from the beginning and in order with the wonderful memory of those who can not read or write , and twice , while he was talking , Pablo reached out for more wine from the bowl . " There was also the cavalry which entered La Granja from the high country where El Sordo fought , " Anselmo went on . Then he told the number of the wounded he had seen and the number of the dead across the saddles . " There was a bundle packed across one saddle that I did not understand , " he said . " But now I know it was the heads . " He went on without pausing . " It was a squadron of cavalry . They had only one officer left . He was not the one who was here in the early morning when you were by the gun . He must have been one of the dead . Two of the dead were officers by their sleeves . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Also they had the mciquina of El Sordo tied to the saddle that bore the heads The barrel was bent . That is all , " he finished.  | " It is enough , " Robert Jordan said and dipped his cup into the wine bowl . " Who beside you has been through the lines to the side of the Republic ? " " Andres and Eladio . " " Which is the better of those two ? " " Andres . " " How long would it take him to get to Navacerrada from here ? " " Carrying no pack and taking his precautions , in three hours withluck . We came by a longer , safer route because of the material . " " He can surely make it ? " " No se , there is no such thing as surely . " " Not for thee either ? " " Nay . " That decides that , Robert Jordan thought to himself . If he had said that he could make it surely , surely I would have sent him . " Andres can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well or better . He is younger . " " But this must absolutely get there . " " If nothing happens he will get there . If anything happens it could happen to any one . " " I will write a dispatch and send it by him , " Robert Jordan said . " I will explain to him where he can find the General . He will be at the Estado Mayor of the Division . " " He will not understand all this of divisions and all , " Anselmo said . " Always has it confused me . He should have the name of the General and where he can be found . " " But it is at the Estado Mayor of the Division that he will be found . " " But is that not a place ? " " Certainly it is a place , old one , " Robert Jordan explained patiently . " But it is a place the General will have selected . It is where he will make his headquarters for the battle . " " Where is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making him stupid . Also words like Brigades , Divisions , Army Corps confused him . First there had been columns , then there were regiments , then there were brigades . Now there were brigades and divisions , both . He did not understand . A place was a place . " Take it slowly , old one , " Robert Jordan said . He knew that if he could not make Anselmo understand he could never explain it clearly to Andres either . " The Estado Mayor of the Division is a place the General will have picked to set up his organization to command . He commands a division , which is two brigades . I do not know where it is because I was not there when it was picked . It will probably be a cave or dugout , a refuge , and wires will run to it . Andres must ask for the General and for the Estado Mayor of the Division . He must give this to the General or to the Chief of his Estado Mayor or to another whose name I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the others are out inspecting the preparations for the attack . Do you understand now ? " " Yes . " " Then get Andres and I will write it now and seal it with this seal . " He showed him the small , round , wooden-backed rubber stamp with the seal of the S. I. M. and the round , tin-covered inking pad no bigger than a fifty-cent piece he carried in his pocket . " That seal they will honor . Get Andres now and I will explain to him . He must go quickly but first he must understand . " " He will understand if I do . But you must make it very clear . This of staffs and divisions is a mystery to me . Always have I gone to such things as definite places such as a house . In Navacerrada it is in the old hotel where the place of command is . In Guadarramait is in a house with a garden . " " With this General , " Robert Jordan said , " it will be some place very close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the planes . Andres will find it easily by asking , if he knows what to ask for . He will only need to show what I have written . But fetch him now for this should get there quickly . " Anselmo went out , ducking under the hanging blanket . Robert Jordan commenced writing in his notebook . " Listen , Inglis , " Pablo said , still looking at the wine bowl . " I am writing , " Robert Jordan said without looking up . " Listen , Inglis , " Pablo spoke directly to the wine bowl . " Thereis no need to be disheartened in this . Without Sordo we have plentyof people to take the posts and blow thy bridge . " " Good , " Robert Jordan said without stopping writing . " Plenty , " Pablo said . " I have admired thy judgment much today , Inglis , " Pablo told the wine bowl . " I think thou hast much picardia.  |p333That  thou art smarter than I am . I have confidence in thee . " Concentrating on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fewestwords and still make it absolutely convincing , trying to put it so the attack would be cancelled , absolutely , yet convince them he was n't trying to have it called off because of any fears he might have about the danger of his own mission , but wished only to put them in possession of all the facts , Robert Jordan was hardly half listening . " Ingles , " Pablo said . " I am writing , " Robert Jordan told him without looking up . I probably should send two copies , he thought . But if I do we will not have enough people to blow it if I have to blow it . What do I know about why this attack is made ? Maybe it is only a holding attack . Maybe they want to draw those troops from somewhere else . Perhaps they make it to draw those planes from the North . Maybe that is what it is about . Perhaps it is not expected to succeed . What do I know about it ? This is my report to Golz . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My orders are clear and if the attack is called off I blow nothing . But I 've got to keep enough people here for the bare minimum necessary to carry the orders out . " What did you say ? " he asked Pablo . " That I have confidence , Ingles . " Pablo was still addressing the wine bowl . Man , I wish I had , Robert Jordan thought . He went on writing.  |p334So  NOW everything had been done that there was to do that night . All orders had been given . Every one knew exactly what he was to do in the morning . Andres had been gone three hours . Either it would come now with the coming of the daylight or it would not come . I believe that it will come , Robert Jordan told himself , walking back down from the upper post where he had gone to speak to Primitivo . Golz makes the attack but he has not the power to cancel it . Permissionto cancel it will have to come from Madrid . The chances are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if they do wake up they will be too sleepy to think . I should have gotten word to Golz sooner of the preparations they have made to meet the attack , but how could I send word about something until it happened ? They did not move up that stuff until just at dark . They did not want to have any movement on the road spotted by planes . But what about all their planes ? What about those fascist planes ? Surely our people must have been warned by them . But perhaps the fascists were faking for another offensive down through Guadalajarawith them . There were supposed to be Italian troops concentrated in Soria , and at Siguenza again besides those operating in the North . They have n't enough troops or material to run two major offensives at the same time though . That is impossible ; so it must be just a bluff . But we know how many troops the Italians have landed all last month and the month before at Cadiz . It is always possible they will try again at Guadalajara , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming down to broaden it out and carry it along the railway to the west of the plateau . There was a way that they could do it all right . Hans had shown him . They made many mistakes the first time . The whole conception was unsound . They had not used any of the same troops in the Arganda offensive against the Madrid-Valenciaroad that they used at Guadalajara . Why had they not made those same drives simultaneously ? Why ? Why ? When would we know why ?  |p335Yet  we had stopped them both times with the very same troops . We never could have stopped them if they had pulled both drives at once . Do n't worry , he told himself . Look at the miracles that have happened before this . Either you will have to blow that bridge in the morning or you will not have to . But do not start deceiving yourself into thinking you wo n't have to blow it . You will blow it one day or you will blow it another . Or if it is not this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not you who decides what shall be done . You follow orders . Follow them and do not try to think beyond them . The orders on this are very clear . Too very clear . But you must not worry nor must you be frightened . For if you allow yourself the luxury of normal fear that fear will infect those who must work with you . But that heads business was quite a thing all the same , he told himself . And the old man running onto them on the hilltop alone . How would you have liked to run onto them like that ? That impressedyou , did n't it ? Yes , that impressed you , Jordan . You have been quite impressed more than once today . But you have behaved O.K. So far you have behaved all right . You do very well for an instructor in Spanish at the University of Montana , he joked at himself . You do all right for that . But do not start to thinking that you are anything very special . You have n't gottenvery far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had any military training and who was a composer and lad about town before the movement and is now a damned good general commandinga brigade . It was all as simple and easy to learn and understandto Duran as chess to a child chess prodigy .

Except that Grandfather always called it the War of the Rebellion . But compared with Duran you were like a good sound chess player against a boy prodigy . Old Duran . It would be good to see Duran again . He would see him at Gaylord 's after this was over . Yes . After this was over . See how well he was behaving ? I 'll see him at Gaylord 's , he said to himself again , after this is over . Do n't kid yourself , he said . You do it all perfectly O.K. Cold . Withoutkidding yourself . You are n't going to see Duran any more and it is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told himself . Do n't go in for any of those luxuries . Nor for heroic resignation either . We do not want any citizens full of heroic resignation in these hills . Your grandfather fought four years in our Civil War and you are just finishing your first year in this war . You have a long time to go yet and you are very well fitted for the work . And now you have Maria , too . Why , you 've got everything . You should n't worry . What is a little brush between a guerilla band and a squadron of cavalry ? That is n't anything . What if they took the heads ? Does that make any difference ? None at all . The Indians always took the scalps when Grandfather was at Fort Kearny after the war . Do you remember the cabinet in your father 's office with the arrowheads spread out on a shelf , and the eagle feathers of the war bonnets that hung on the wall , their plumes slanting , the smoked buckskin smell of the leggings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you remember the great stave of the buffalo bow that leaned in a corner of the cabinet and the two quivers of hunting and war arrows , and how the bundle of shafts felt when you closed your hand around them ? Remember something like that . Remember something concrete and practical . Remember Grandfather 's saber , bright and well oiled in its dented scabbard and Grandfather showed you how the blade had been thinned from the many times it had been to the grinder 's . Remember Grandfather 's Smith and Wesson . It was a single action , officer 's model .32 caliber and there was no trigger guard . It had the softest , sweetest trigger pull you had ever felt and it was always well oiled and the bore was clean although the finish was all worn off and the brown metal of the barrel and the cylinder was worn . smooth from the leather of the holster . It was kept in the holster with a U. S. on the flap in a drawer in the cabinet with its cleaning equipment and two hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tied neatly with waxed twine . You could take the pistol out of the drawer and hold it . " Handle it freely , " was Grandfather 's expression . But you could not play with it because it was " a serious weapon . " You asked Grandfather once if he had ever killed any one with it and he said , " Yes . "  |p337Then  you said , " When , Grandfather ? " and he said , " In the War of the Rebellion and afterwards . " You said , " Will you tell me about it , Grandfather ? " And he said , " I do not care to speak about it , Robert . " Then after your father had shot himself with this pistol , and you had come home from school and they 'd had the funeral , the coroner had returned it after the inquest saying , " Bob , I guess you might want to keep the gun . I 'm supposed to hold it , but I know your dad set a lot of store by it because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out here when he first came out with the Cavalry , and it 's still a hell of a good gun . I had her out trying her this afternoon . She do n't throw much of a slug but you can hit things with her . " He had put the gun back in the drawer in the cabinet where it belonged , but the next day he took it out and he had ridden up to the top of the high country above Red Lodge , with Chub , where they had built the road to Cooke City now over the pass and across the Bear Tooth plateau , and up there where the wind was thin and there was snow all summer on the hills they had stopped by the lake which was supposed to be eight hundred feet deep and was a deep green color , and Chub held the two horses and he climbed out on a rock and leaned over and saw his face in the still water , and saw himself holding the gun , and then he dropped it , holding it by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until it was just as big as a watch charm in that clear water , and then it was out of sight . Then he came back off the rock and when he swung up into the saddle he gave old Bess such a clout with the spurs she started to buck like an old rocking horse . He bucked her out along the shore of the lake and as soon as she was reasonable they went on back along the trail . " I know why you did that with the old gun , Bob , " Chub said . " Well , then we do n't have to talk about it , " he had said . They never talked about it and that was the end of Grandfather 's side arms except for the saber . He still had the saber in his trunk with the rest of his things at Missoula . I wonder what Grandfather would think of this situation , he thought . Grandfather was a hell of a good soldier , everybody said . They said if he had been with Custer that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How could he ever not have seen the smoke nor the dust of all those lodges down there in the draw along the Little Big Horn unless there must have been a heavy morning mist ? But there was n't any mist . I wish Grandfather were here instead of me . Well , maybe we will all be together by tomorrow night . If there should be any such damn fool business as a hereafter , and I 'm sure there is n't , he thought , I would certainly like to talk to him . Because there are a lot of things I would like to know . I have a right to ask him now because I have had to do the same sort of things myself . I do n't think he 'd mind my asking now . I had no right to ask before . I understand him not telling me because he did n't know me . But now I think that we would get along all right . I 'd like to be able to talk to him now and get his advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd just like to talk to him . It 's a shame there is such a jump in time between ones like us . Then , as he thought , he realized that if there was any such thing as ever meeting , both he and his grandfather would be acutely embarrassed by the presence of his father . Any one has a right to do it , he thought . But it is n't a good thing to do . I understand it , but I do not approve of it . Lache was the word . But you do understand it ? Sure , I understand it but . Yes , but . You have to be awfully occupied with yourself to do a thing like that . Aw hell , I wish Grandfather was here , he thought . For about an hour anyway . Maybe he sent me what little I have through that other one that misused the gun . Maybe that is the only communicationthat we have . But , damn it . Truly damn it , but I wish the timelagwas n't so long so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never had to teach me . But suppose the fear he had to go through and dominate and just get rid of finally in four years of that and then in the Indian fighting , although in that , mostly , there could n't have been so much fear , had made a cobarde out of the other one the way second generation bullfighters almost always are ? Suppose that ? And maybe the good juice only came through straight again after passing through that one ? I 'll never forget how sick it made me the first time I knew he was a cobarde . Go on , say it in English . Coward . It 's easier when you have it said and there is never any point in referring to a son of a bitch by some foreign term . He was n't any son of a bitch , though.  |p339He  was just a coward and that was the worst luck any man could have . Because if he was n't a coward he would have stood up to that woman and not let her bully him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had married a different woman ? That 's something you 'll never know , he thought , and grinned . Maybe the bully in her helped to supply what was missing in the other . And you . ' Take it a little easy . Do n't get to referring to the good juice and such other things until you are through tomorrow . Do n't be snotty too soon . And then do n't be snotty at all . We 'll see what sort of juice you have tomorrow . But he started thinking about Grandfather again . " George Custer was not an intelligent leader of cavalry , Robert , " his grandfather had said . " He was not even an intelligent man . " He remembered that when his grandfather said that he felt resentmentthat any one should speak against that figure in the buckskinshirt , the yellow curls blowing , that stood on that hill holding a service revolver as the Sioux closed in around him in the old Anheuser-Busch lithograph that hung on the poolroom wall in Red Lodge . " He just had great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " his grandfather went on , " and on the Little Big Horn he got into it but he could n't get out . " Now Phil Sheridan was an intelligent man and so was Jeb Stuart . But John Mosby was the finest cavalry leader that ever lived . " He had a letter in his things in the trunk at Missoula from GeneralPhil Sheridan to old Killy-the-Horse Kilpatrick that said his grandfather was a finer leader of irregular cavalry than John Mosby . I ought to tell Golz about my grandfather , he thought . He would n't ever have heard of him though . He probably never even heard of John Mosby . The British all had heard of them though because they had to study our Civil War much more than people did on the Continent . Karkov said after this was over I could go to the Lenin Institute in Moscow if I wanted to . He said I could go to the military academy of the Red Army if I wanted to do that . I wonder what Grandfather would think of that ? Grandfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his life . Well , I do n't want to be a soldier , he thought . I know that . So that 's out . I just want us to win this war . I guess really good soldiers are really good at very little else , he thought . That 's obviously un- true . Look at Napoleon and Wellington . You 're very stupid this evening , he thought . Usually his mind was very good company and tonight it had been when he thought about his grandfather . Then thinking of his father had thrown him off . He understood his father and he forgave him everything and he pitied him but he was ashamed of him . You better not think at all , he told himself . Soon you will be with Maria and you wo n't have to think . That 's the best way now that everything is worked out . When you have been concentrating so hard on something you ca n't stop and your brain gets to racing like a flywheel with the weight gone . You better just not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose that when the planes unloadthey smash those anti-tank guns and just blow hell out of the positions and the old tanks roll good up whatever hill it is for once and old Golz boots that bunch of drunks , clochards , bums , fanaticsand heroes that make up the Quatorzieme Brigade ahead of him , and I know how good Duran 's people are in Golz 's other brigade , and we are in Segovia tomorrow night . Yes . Just suppose , he said to himself . I 'll settle for La Granja , he told himself . But you are going to have to blow that bridge , he suddenly knew absolutely . There wo n't be any calling off . Because the way you have just been supposing there for a minute is how the possibilities of that attack look to those who have ordered it . Yes , you will have to blow the bridge , he knew truly . Whatever happens to Andres does n't matter . Coming down the trail there in the dark , alone with the good feeling that everything that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with the confidence that had come from thinking back to concrete things , the knowledge that he would surely have to blow the bridge came to him almost with comfort . The uncertainty , the enlargement of the feeling of being uncertain , as when , through a misunderstanding of possible dates , one does not know whether the guests are really coming to a party , that had been with him ever since he had dispatched Andres with the report to Golz , had all dropped from him now . He was sure now that the festival would not be cancelled . It 's much better to be sure , he thought . It 's always much better to be sure.  |p341So  NOW they were in the robe again together and it was late in the last night . Maria lay close against him and he felt the long smoothnessof her thighs against his and her breasts like two small hills that rise out of the long plain where there is a well , and the far country beyond the hills was the valley of her throat where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not think and she stroked his head with her hand . " Roberto , " Maria said very softly and kissed him . " I am ashamed . 1 do not wish to disappoint thee but there is a great soreness and much pain . I do not think I would be any good to thee . " " There is always a great soreness and much pain , " he said . " Nay , rabbit . That is nothing . We will do nothing that makes pain . " " It is not that . It is that I am not good to receive thee as I wish to . " " That is of no importance . That is a passing thing . We are togetherwhen we lie together . " " Yes , but I am ashamed . I think it was from when the things were done to me that it comes . Not from thee and me . " " Let us not talk of that . " " Nor do I wish to . I meant I could not bear to fail thee now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Listen , rabbit , " he said . " All such things pass and then there is no problem . " But he thought ; it was not good luck for the last night . Then he was ashamed and said , " Lie close against me , rabbit . I love thee as much feeling thee against me in here in the dark as I love thee making love . " " I am deeply ashamed because I thought it might be again tonight as it was in the high country when we came down from El Sordo 's . " " Que. va , " he said to her . " That is not for every day . I like it thus as well as the other . " He lied , putting aside disappointment . " We will be here together quietly and we will sleep . Let us talk together . I know thee very little from talking . "  | " Should we speak of tomorrow and of thy work ? I would like to be intelligent about thy work . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length of the robe and lay now quietly with his cheek against her shoulder , his left arm under her head . " The most intelligent is not to talk about tomorrownor what happened today . In this we do not discuss the losses and what we must do tomorrow we will do . Thou art not afraid ? " " Que va , " she said . " I am always afraid . But now I am afraid for thee so much I do not think of me . " " Thou must not , rabbit . I have been in many things . And worse than this , " he lied . Then suddenly surrendering to something , to the luxury of going into unreality , he said , " Let us talk of Madrid and of us in Madrid . " " Good , " she said . Then , " Oh , Roberto , I am sorry I have failed thee . Is there not some other thing that I can do for thee ? " He stroked her head and kissed her and then lay close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . " Thou canst talk with me of Madrid , " he said and thought : I 'll keep any oversupply of that for tomorrow . I 'll need all of that there is tomorrow . There are no pine needles that need that now as I will need it tomorrow . Who was it cast his seed upon the ground in the Bible ? Onan . How did Onan turn out ? he thought . I do n't remember ever hearing any more about Onan . He smiled in the dark . Then he surrendered again and let himself slip into it . feeling a voluptuousness of surrender into unreality that was like a sexual acceptance of something that could come in the night when there was no understanding , only the delight of acceptance . " My beloved , " he said , and kissed her . " Listen . The other night I was thinking about Madrid and I thought how I would get there and leave thee at the hotel while I went up to see people at the hotel of the Russians . But that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Why not ? " " Because I will take care of thee . I will not ever leave thee . I will go with thee to the Seguridad to get papers . Then I will go with thee to buy those clothes that are needed . " " They are few , and I can buy them . "  | " Nay , they are many and we will go together and buy good ones and thou wilt be beautiful in them . " " I would rather we stayed in the room in the hotel and sent out for the clothes . Where is the hotel ? " " It is on the Plaza del Callao . We will be much in that room in that hotel . There is a wide bed with clean sheets and there is hot running water in the bathtub and there are two closets and 1 will keep my things in one and thou wilt take the other . And there arc tall , wide windows that open , and outside , in the streets , there is the spring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but with good food , and I know shops where there is still wine and whiskey . And we will keep things to eat in the room for when we are hungry and also whiskey for when I wish a drink and I will buy thee man-zanilla . " " I would like to try the whiskey . " " But since it is difficult to obtain and if thou likest manzanilla . " " Keep thy whiskey , Roberto , " she said . " Oh , I love thee very much . Thou and thy whiskey that I could not have . What a pig thou art . " " Nay , you shall try it . But it is not good for a woman . " " And I have only had things that were good for a woman , " Maria said . " Then there in bed I will still wear my wedding shirt ? " " Nay . I will buy thee various nightgowns and pajamas too if you should prefer them . " " I will buy seven wedding shirts , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I will buy a clean wedding shirt for thee . Dost ever wash thy shirt ? " " Sometimes . " " I will keep everything clean and I will pour thy whiskey and put the water in it as it was done at Sordo 's . I will obtain olives and salted codfish and hazel nuts for thee to eat while thou drinkest and we will stay in the room for a month and never leave it . If I am fit to receive thee , " she said , suddenly unhappy . " That is nothing , " Robert Jordan told her . " Truly it is nothing . It is possible thou wert hurt there once and now there is a scar that makes a further hurting . Such a thing is possible . All such things pass . And also there are good doctors in Madrid if there is truly anything . " " But all was good before , " she said pleadingly.  | " That is the promise that all will be good again . ' " Then let us talk again about Madrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of her head against his shoulder . " But will I not be so ugly there with this cropped head that thou wilt be ashamed of me ? " " Nay . Thou art lovely . Thou hast a lovely face and a beautiful body , long and light , and thy skin is smooth and the color of burnt gold and every one will try to take thee from me . " " Que va , take me from thee , " she said . " No other man will ever touch me 611 1 die . Take me from thee ! Que va . " " But many will try . Thou wilt see . " " They will see I love thee so that they will know it would be as unsafe as putting their hands into a caldron of melted lead to touch me . But thou ? When thou seest beautiful women of the same culture as thee ? Thou wilt not be ashamed of me ? " " Never . And I will marry thee . " " If you wish , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Church I do not think it carries importance . " " I would like us to be married . " " If you wish . But listen . If we were ever in another country where there still was the Church perhaps we could be married in it there . " " In my country they still have the Church , " he told her . " There we can be married in it if it means aught to thee . I have never been married . There is no problem . " " I am glad thou hast never been married , " she said . " But I am glad thou knowest about such things as you have told me for that means thou hast been with many women and the Pilar told me that it is only such men who are possible for husbands . But thou wilt not run with other women now ? Because it would kill me . " " I have never run with many women , " he said , truly . " Until thee I did not think that I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then held her hands clasped behind his head . " Thou must have known very many . " " Not to love them . " " Listen . The Pilar told me something --  " " Say it . " " No . It is better not to . Let us talk again about Madrid . " " What was it you were going to say ? "  | " I do not wish to say it . " " Perhaps it would be better to say it if it could be important . " " You think it is important ? " " Yes . " " But how can you know when you do not know what it is ? " " From thy manner . " " I will not keep it from you then . The Pilar told me that we would all die tomorrow and that you know it as well as she does and that you give it no importance . She said this not in criticism but in admiration . " " She said that ? " he said . The crazy bitch , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her gypsy manure . That is the way old market women and cafe cowards talk . That is manuring obscenity . " He felt the sweat that came from under his armpits and slid down between his arm and his side and he said to himself , " So you are scared , eh ? " and aloud he said , " She is a manure-mouthed superstitious bitch . Let us talk again of Madrid . " " Then you know no such thing ? " " Of course not . Do not talk such manure , " he said , using a stronger , ugly word . But this time when he talked about Madrid there was no slipping into make-believe again . Now he was just lying to his girl and to himself to pass the night before battle and he knew it . He liked to do it , but all the luxury of the acceptance was gone . But he started again . " I have thought about thy hair , " he said . " And what we can do about it . You see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the fur of an animal and it is lovely to feel and I love it very much and it is beautiful and it flattens and rises like a wheatfield in the wind when I pass my hand over it . " " Pass thy hand over it . " He did and left his hand there and went on talking to her throat , as he felt his own throat swell . " But in Madrid I thought we could go together to the coiffeur 's and they could cut it neatly on the sides and in the back as they cut mine and that way it would look better in the town while it is growing out . " " I would look like thee , " she said and held him close to her . " And then I never would want to change it . "   " Nay . It will grow all the time and that will only be to keep it neat at the start while it is growing long . How long will it take it to grow long ? " " Really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders . It is thus I would have thee wear it . " " As Garbo in the cinema ? " " Yes , " he said thickly . Now the making believe was coming back in a great rush and he would take it all to him . It had him now , and again he surrendered and went on . " So it will hang straight to thy shoulders and curl at the ends as a wave of the sea curls , and it will be the color of ripe wheat and thy face the color of burnt gold and thine eyes the only color they could be with thy hair and thy skin , gold with the dark flecks in them , and I will push thy head back and look in thy eyes and hold thee tight against me " " Where ? " " Anywhere . Wherever it is that we are . How long will it take for thy hair to grow ? " " I do not know because it never had been cut before . But I think in six months it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a year as long as thou couldst ever wish . But do you know what will happen first ? " " Tell me . " " We will be in the big clean bed in thy famous room in our famous hotel and we will sit in the famous bed together and look into the mirror of the armoire and there will be thee and there will be me in the glass and then I will turn to thee thus , and put my arms around thee thus , and then I will kiss thee thus . " Then they lay quiet and close together in the night , hot-aching , rigid , close together and holding her , Robert Jordan held closely too all those things that he knew could never happen , and he went on with it deliberately and said , " Rabbit , we will not always live in that hotel . " " Why not ? " " We can get an apartment in Madrid on that street that runs along the Parque of the Buen Retiro . I know an American woman who furnished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get such an apartment for only the rent that was paid before the movement . There are apartments there that face on the park and you can see all of the park from the windows ; the iron fence , the gardens , and the gravel walks and the green of the lawns where they touch the gravel , and the trees deep with shadows and the many fountains , and now the chestnut trees will be in bloom . In Madrid we can walk in the park and row on the lake if the water is back in it now . " " Why would the water be out ? " " They drained it in November because it made a mark to sight from when the planes came over for bombing . But I think that the water is back in it now . I am not sure . But even if there is no water in it we can walk through all the park away from the lake and there is a part that is like a forest with trees from all parts of the world with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees they are and where they came from . " " I would almost as soon go to the cinema , " Maria said . " But the trees sound very interesting and I will learn them all with thee if I can remember them . " " They are not as in a museum , " Robert Jordan said . " They grow naturally and there are hills in the park and part of the park is like a jungle . Then below it there is the book fair where along the sidewalksthere are hundreds of booths with second-hand books in them and now , since the movement , there are many books , stolen in the looting of the houses which have been bombed and from the houses of the fascists , and brought to the book fair by those who stole them . I could spend all day every day at the stalls of the book fair as I once did in the days before the movement , if I ever could have any time in Madrid . " " While thou art visiting the book fair I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Will we have enough money for a servant ? " " Surely . I can get Petra who is at the hotel if she pleases thee . She cooks well and is clean . I have eaten there with newspapermen that she cooks for . They have electric stoves in their rooms . " " If you wish her , " Maria said . " Or I can find some one . But wilt thou not be away much with thy work ? They would not let me go with thee on such work as this . "   " Perhaps I can get work in Madrid . I have done this work now for a long time and I have fought since the start of the movement . It is possible that they would give me work now in Madrid . I have never asked for it . I have always been at the front or in such work as this . " Do you know that until I met thee I have never asked for anything ? Nor wanted anything ? Nor thought of anything except the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been very pure in my ambitions . I have worked much and now I love thee and , " he said it now in a complete embracing of all that would not be , " I love thee as I love all that we have fought for . I love thee as I love liberty and dignity and the rights of all men to work and not be hungry . I love thee as I love Madrid that we have defended and as I love all my comrades that have died . And many have died . Many . Many . Thou canst not think how many . But I love thee as I love what I love most in the world and I love thee more . I love thee very much , rabbit . More than I can tell thee . But I say this now to tell thee a little . I have never had a wife and now I have thee for a wife and I am happy . " " I will make thee as good a wife as I can , " Maria said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will try to make up for that . If we live in Madrid ; good . If we must live in any other place ; good . If we live nowhere and I can go with thee ; better . If we go to thy country I will learn to talk Ingles like the most Ingles that there is . I will study all their manners and as they do so will I do . " " Thou wilt be very comic . " " Surely . I will make mistakes but you will tell me and I will never make them twice , or maybe only twice . Then in thy country if thou art lonesome for our food I can cook for thee . And I will go to a school to learn to be a wife , if there is such a school , and study at it . " " There are such schools but thou dost not need that schooling . " " Pilar told me that she thought they existed in your country . She had read of them in a periodical . And she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to speak it well so thou wouldst never be ashamed of me . " " When did she tell you this ? " " Today while we were packing . Constantly she talked to me about what I should do to be thy wife " P349I guess she was going to Madrid too , Robert Jordan thought , and said , " What else did she say ? " " She said I must take care of my body and guard the line of my figure as though I were a bullfighter . She said this was of great importance . " " It is , " Robert Jordan said . " But thou hast not to worry about that for many years . " " No . She said those of our race must watch that always as it can come suddenly . She told me she was once as slender as I but that in those days women did not take exercise . She told me what exercisesI should take and that I must not eat too much . She told me which things not to eat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Potatoes , " he said . " Yes , " she went on . " It was potatoes and things that are fried . Also when I told her about this of the soreness she said I must not tell thee but must support the pain and not let thee know . But I told thee because I do not wish to lie to thee ever and also I feared that thou might think we did not have the joy in common any longer and that other , as it was in the high country , had not truly hap-pened . " " It was right to tell me . " " Truly ? For I am ashamed and I will do anything for thee that thou should wish . Pilar has told me of things one can do for a husband . " " There is no need to do anything . What we have we have togetherand we will keep it and guard it . I love thee thus lying beside thee and touching thee and knowing thou art truly there and when thou art ready again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not necessities that I can care for ? She explained that to me . " " Nay . We will have our necessities together . I have no necessities apart from thee . " " That seems much better to me . But understand always that I will do what you wish . But thou must tell me for I have great ignorance and much of what she told me I did not understand clearly . For I was ashamed to ask and she is of such great and varied wisdom . " P350 " Rabbit , " he said . " Thou art very wonderful . " " Que va , " she said . " But to try to learn all of that which goes into wifehood in a day while we are breaking camp and packing for a battle with another battle passing in the country above is a rare thing and if I make serious mistakes thou must tell me for I love thee . It could be possible for me to remember things incorrectly and much that she told me was very complicated . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many things I can not remember them . She said I could tell thee of what was done to me if I ever began to think of it again because thou art a good man and already have understood it all . But that it were better never to speak of it unless it came on me as a black thing as it had been before and then that telling it to thee might rid me of it . " " Does it weigh on thee now ? " " No . It is as though it had never happened since we were first together . There is the sorrow for my parents always . But that there will be always . But I would have thee know that which you should know for thy own pride if I am to be thy wife . Never did I submit to any one . Always I fought and always it took two of them or more to do me the harm . One would sit on my head and hold me . I tell thee this for thy pride . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " Nay , I speak of thy own pride which it is necessary to have in thy wife . And another thing . My father was the mayor of the village and an honorable man . My mother was an honorable woman and a good Catholic and they shot her with my father because of the politics of my father who was a Republican . I saw both of them shot and my father said , Viva la Republica , ' when they shot him standing against the wall of the slaughterhouse of our village . " My mother standing against the same wall said , Viva my husbandwho was the Mayor of this village , ' and I hoped they would shoot me too and I was going to say Viva la Republica y vivan mis padres , ' but instead there was no shooting but instead the doing of the things . " Listen . I will tell thee of one thing since it affects us . After the shooting at the matadero they took us , those relatives who had seen it but were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intop351the main square of the town . Nearly all were weeping but some were numb with what they had seen and the tears had dried in them . I myself could not cry . I did not notice anything that passed for I could only see my father and my mother at the moment of the shooting and my mother saying , Long live my husband who is Mayor of this village , ' and this was in my head like a scream that would not die but kept on and on . For my mother was not a Republicanand she would not say , Viva la Repuiblica , ' but only Viva my father who lay there , on his face , by her feet . " But what she had said , she had said very loud , like a shriek and then they shot and she fell and I tried to leave the line to go to her but we were all tied . The shooting was done by the guardia civil and they were still there waiting to shoot more when the Falangists herded us away and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifles and leaving all the bodies there against the wall . We were tied by the wrists in a long line of girls and women and they herded us up by the hill and through the streets to the square and in the square they stopped in front of the barbershop which was across the square from the city hall . " Then the two men looked at us and one said , That is the daughter of the Mayor , ' and the other said , Commence with her . ' " Then they cut the rope that was on each of my wrists , one saying to others of them , Tie up the line , ' and these two took me by the arms and into the barbershop and lifted me up and put me in the barber 's chair and held me there . " I saw my face in the mirror of the barbershop and the faces of those who were holding me and the faces of three others who were leaning over me and I knew none of their faces but in the glass I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it was as though one were in the dentist 's chair and there were many dentists and they were all insane . My own face I could hardly recognize because my grief had changed it but I looked at it and knew that it was me . But my grief was so great that I had no fear nor any feeling but my grief . " At that time I wore my hair in two braids and as I watched in the mirror one of them lifted one of the braids and pulled on it so it hurt me suddenly through my grief and then cut it off close to my head with a razor . And I saw myself with one braid and a slash.  |p352where  the other had been . Then he cut off the other braid but withoutpulling on it and the razor made a small cut on my ear and I saw blood come from it . Canst thou feel the scar with thy finger ? " " Yes . But would it be better not to talk of this ? " " This is nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So he had cut both braids close to my head with a razor and the others laughed and I did not even feel the cut on my ear and then he stood in front of me and struck me across the face with the braids while the other two held me and he said , This is how we make Red nuns . This will show thee how to unite with thy proletarian brothers . Bride of the Red Christ ! ' " And he struck me again and again across the face with the braids which had been mine and then he put the two of them in my mouth and tied them tight around my neck , knotting them in the back to make a gag and the two holding me laughed . " And all of them who saw it laughed and when I saw them laugh in the mirror I commenced to cry because until then I had been too frozen in myself from the shooting to be able to cry . " Then the one who had gagged me ran a clippers all over my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back of the neck and then across the top and then all over my head and close behind my ears and they held me so I could see into the glass of the barber 's mirror all the time that they did this and I could not believe it as I saw it done and I cried and I cried but I could not look away from the horror that my face made with the mouth open and the braids tied in it and my head coming naked under the clippers . " And when the one with the clippers was finished he took a bottle of iodine from the shelf of the barber ( they had shot the barber too for he belonged to a syndicate , and he lay in the doorway of the shop and they had lifted me over him as they brought me in ) and with the glass wand that is in the iodine bottle he touched me on the ear where it had been cut and the small pain of that came through my grief and through my horror . " Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my forehead with the iodine , lettering it slowly and carefully as though he were an artist and I saw all of this as it happened in the mirror and I no longer cried for my heart was frozen in me for my father and my mother and what happened to me now was nothing and I knew it .   " Then when he had finished the lettering , the Falangist stepped back and looked at me to examine his work and then he put down the iodine bottle and picked up the clippers and said , Next , ' and they took me out of the barbershop holding me tight by each arm and I stumbled over the barber lying there still in the doorway on his back with his gray face up , and we nearly collided with ConcepcionGracia , my best friend , that two of them were bringing in and when she saw me she did not recognize me , and then she recognizedme , and she screamed , and I could hear her screaming all the time they were shoving me across the square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city hall and into the office of my father where they laid me onto the couch . And it was there that the bad things were done . " " My rabbit , " Robert Jordan said and held her as close and as gently as he could . But he was as full of hate as any man could be . " Do not talk more about it . Do not tell me any more for I can not bear my hatred now . " She was stiff and cold in his arms and she said , " Nay . I will never talk more of it . But they are bad people and I would like to kill some of them with thee if I could . But I have told thee this only for thy pride if I am to be thy wife . So thou wouldst understand . " " I am glad you told me , " he said . " For tomorrow , with luck , we will kill plenty . " " But will we kill Falangists ? It was they who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said gloomily . " They kill at the rear . It is not them we fight in battle . " " But can we not kill them in some way ? I would like to kill some very much . " " I have killed them , " he said . " And we will kill them again . At the trains we have killed them . " " I would like to go for a train with thee , " Maria said . " The time of the train that Filar brought me back from I was somewhat crazy . Did she tell thee how I was ? " " Yes . Do not talk of it . " " I was dead in my head with a numbness and all I could do was cry . But there is another thing that I must tell thee . This I must . Then perhaps thou wilt not marry me . But , Roberto , if thou should not wish to marry me , can we not , then , just be always together ? "   " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten this . Perhaps you should not . It is possible that I can never bear thee either a son or a daughter for the Pilar says that if I could it would have happened to me with the things which were done . I must tell thee that . Oh , I do not know why I had forgotten that . " " It is of no importance , rabbit , " he said . " First it may not be true . That is for a doctor to say . Then I would not wish to bring either a son or a daughter into this world as this world is . And also you take all the love I have to give . " " I would like to bear thy son and thy daughter , " she told him . " And how can the world be made better if there are no children of us who fight against the fascists ? " " Thou , " he said . " I love thee . Hearest thou ? And now we must sleep , rabbit . For I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early in this month . " " Then is it all right about the last thing I said ? We can still be married ? " " We are married , now . I marry thee now . Thou art my wife . But go to sleep , my rabbit , for there is little time now . " " And we will truly be married ? Not just a talking ? " " Truly . " " Then I will sleep and think of that if I wake . " " I , too . " " Good night , my husband . " " Good night , " he said . " Good night , wife . " He heard her breathing steadily and regularly now and he knew she was asleep and he lay awake and very still not wanting to waken her by moving . He thought of all the part she had not told him and he lay there hating and he was pleased there would be killing in the morning . But I must not take any of it personally , he thought . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did dreadful things to them too . But it was because we were uneducated and knew no better . But they did that on purpose and deliberately . Those who did that are the last flowering of what their education has produced . Those are the flowers of Spanish chivalry . What a people they have been . What sons of bitches from Cortez , Pizarro , Menendez de Avila all down through Enrique Lister to Pablo . And what won-P355derful people . There is no finer and no worse people in the world . No kinder people and no crueler . And who understands them ? Not me , because if I did I would forgive it all . To understand is to forgive . That 's not true . Forgiveness has been exaggerated . Forgiveness is a Christian idea and Spain has never been a Christian country . It has always had its own special idol worship within the Church . Otra Virgen ma 's . I suppose that was why they had to destroy the virgins of their enemies . Surely it was deeper with them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people . The people had grown away from the Church because the Church was in the government and the government had always been rotten . This was the only country that the reformation never reached . They were paying for the Inquisition now , all right . Well , it was something to think about . Something to keep your mind from worrying about your work . It was sounder than pretending . God , he had done a lot of pretending tonight . And Pila : had been pretending all day . Sure . What if they were killed tomorrow ? What did it matter as long as they did the bridge properly ? That was all they had to do tomorrow : It did n't . You could n't do these things indefinitely . But you were n't supposed to live forever . Maybe I have had all my life in three days , he thought . If that 's true I wish we would have spent the last night differently . But last nights are never any good . Last nothings are any good . Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was Mayor of this town " was good . He knew it was good because it made a tingle run all over him when he said it to himself . He leaned over and kissed Maria who did not wake . In English he whispered very quietly , " I 'd like to marry you , rabbit . I 'm very proud of your family . " P356ON THAT same night in Madrid there were many people at the Hotel Gaylord . A car pulled up under the porte-cochere of the hotel , its headlights painted over with blue calcimine and a little man in black riding boots , gray riding breeches and a short , gray highbuttonedjacket stepped out and returned the salute of the two sen , tries as he opened the door , nodded to the secret policeman who sat at the concierge 's desk and stepped into the elevator . There were two sentries seated on chairs inside the door , one on each side of the marble entrance hall , and these only looked up as the little man passed them at the door of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one they did not know along the flanks , under the armpits , and over the hip pockets to see if the person entering carried a pistol and , if he did , have him check it with the concierge . But they knew the short man in riding boots very well and they hardly looked up as he passed . The apartment where he lived in Gaylord 's was crowded as he entered . People were sitting and standing about and talking together as in any drawing room and the men and the women were drinking vodka , whiskey and soda , and beer from small glasses filled from great pitchers . Four of the men were in uniform . The others wore windbreakers or leather jackets and three of the four women were dressed in ordinary street dresses while the fourth , who was haggardlythin and dark , wore a sort of severely cut militiawoman 's uniform with a skirt with high boots under it . When he came into the room , Karkov went at once to the woman in the uniform and bowed to her and shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her in Russian that no one could hear and for a moment the insolence that had been in his eyes as he entered the room was gone . Then it lighted again as he saw the mahogany-colored head and the love-lazy face of the well-constructed girl who was his mistress and he strode with short , precise steps over to her and bowed and shook her hand in such a way that no one could tell it was not a mimicry of his greeting to his wife . His wifeP357had not looked after him as he walked across the room . She was standing with a tall , good-looking Spanish officer and they were kalking Russian now . " Your great love is getting a little fat , " Karkov was saying to the girl . " All of our heroes are fattening now as we approach the second year . " He did not look at the man he was speaking of . " You are so ugly you would be jealous of a toad , " the girl told him cheerfully . She spoke in German . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow ? " " No . Nor is there one . " " Every one knows about it , " the girl said . " Do n't be so mysterious . Dolores is going . I will go with her or Carmen . Many people are going . " " Go with whoever will take you , " Karkov said . " I will not . " Then he turned to the girl and asked seriously , " Who told thee of it ? Be exact . " " Richard , " she said as seriously . Karkov shrugged his shoulders and left her standing . " Karkov , " a man of middle height with a gray , heavy , sagging face , puffed eye pouches and a pendulous under-lip called to him in a dyspeptic voice . " Have you heard the good news ? " Karkov went over to him and the man said , " I only have it now , Not ten minutes ago . It is wonderful . All day the fascists have been fighting among themselves near Segovia . They have been forced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the afternoon they were bombing their own troops with planes . " " Yes ? " asked Karkov . " That is true , " the puffy-eyed man said . " Dolores brought the news herself . She was here with the news and was in such a state of radiant exultation as I have never seen . The truth of the news shone from her face . That great face  --  " he said happily . " That great face , " Karkov said with no tone in his voice at all . " If you could have heard her , " the puffy-eyed man said . " The news itself shone from her with a light that was not of this world . In her voice you could tell the truth of what she said . I am putting it in an article for Izuestia . It was one of the greatest moments of the war to me when I heard the report in that great voice where pity , compassion and truth are blended . Goodness and truth shine fromP358her as from a true saint of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pasionaria . " " Not for nothing , " Karkov said in a dull voice . " You better write it for Izvestia now , before you forget that last beautiful lead . " " That is a woman that is not to joke about . Not even by a cynic like you , " the puffy-eyed man said . " If you could have been here to hear her and to see her face . " " That great voice , " Karkov said . " That great face . Write it , " he said . " Do n't tell it to me . Do n't waste whole paragraphs on me . Go and write it now . " " Not just now . " " I think you 'd better , " Karkov said and looked at him , and then looked away . The puffy-eyed man stood there a couple of minutes more holding his glass of vodka , his eyes , puffy as they were , absorbed in the beauty of what he had seen and heard and then he left the room to write it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was short , chunky , jovial-looking with pale blue eyes , thinning blond hair and a gay mouth under a bristly yellow moustache . This man was in uniform . He was a divisional commander and he was a Hungarian . " Were you here when the Dolores was here ? " Karkov asked the man . " Yes . " " What was the stuff ? " " Something about the fascists fighting among themselves . Beautifulif true . " " You hear much talk of tomorrow . " " Scandalous . All the journalists should be shot as well as most of the people in this room and certainly the intriguing German unmentionableof a Richard . Whoever gave that Sunday fuggler command of a brigade should be shot . Perhaps you and me should be shot too . It is possible , " the General laughed . " Do n't suggest it though . " " That is a thing I never like to talk about , " Karkov said . " That American who comes here sometimes is over there . You know the one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is there where this business they spoke of is supposed to happen . " " Well , he should have a report through on it tonight then , " thep359General said . " They do n't like me down there or I 'd go down and find out for you . He works with Golz on this , does n't he ? You 'll see Golz tomorrow . " " Early tomorrow . " " Keep out of his way until it 's going well , " the General said . " He hates you bastards as much as I do . Though he has a much better temper . " " But about this --  " " It was probably the fascists having manoeuvres , " the General grinned . " Well , we 'll see if Golz can manoeuvre them a little . Let Golz try hi ; hand at it . We manoeuvred them at Guadalajara . " " I hear you are travelling too , " Karkov said , showing his bad teeth as he smiled . The General was suddenly angry . " And me too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us always . This filthy sewing circle of gossip . One man who could keep his mouth shut could save the country if he believed he could . " " Your friend Prieto can keep his mouth shut . " " But he does n't believe he can win . How can you win without belief in the people ? " " You decide that , " Karkov said . " I am going to get a little sleep . " He left the smoky , gossip-filled room and went into the back bedroom and sat down on the bed and pulled his boots off . He could still hear them talking so he shut the door and opened the window . He did not bother to undress because at two o'clock he would be starting for the drive by Colmenar , Cerceda , and Navacerradaup to the front where Golz would be attacking in the morning.  |p360IT  WAS two o'clock in the morning when Pilar waked him . As her hand touched him he thought , at first , it was Maria and he rolled toward her and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand shook his shoulder and he was suddenly , completely and absolutely awake and his hand was around the butt of the pistol that lay alongside of his bare right leg and all of him was as cocked as the pistol with its safety catch slipped off . In the dark he saw it was Pilar and he looked at the dial of his wrist watch with the two hands shining in the short angle close to the top and seeing it was only two , he said , " What passes with thee , woman ? " " Pablo is gone , " the big woman said to him . Robert Jordan put on his trousers and shoes . Maria had not waked . " When ? " he asked . " It must be an hour . " " And ? " " He has taken something of thine , " the woman said miserably . " So . What ? " " I do not know , " she told him . " Come and see . " In the dark they walked over to the entrance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Robert Jordan followed her in the dead-ashes , bad-air and sleeping-men smell of the cave , shining his electric torch so that he would not step on any of those who were sleeping on the floor . Anselmo woke and said , " Is it time ? " " No , " Robert Jordan whispered . " Sleep , old one . " The two sacks were at the head of Pilar 's bed which was screened off with a hanging blanket from the rest of the cave . The bed smelt stale and sweat-dried and sickly-sweet the way an Indian 's bed does as Robert Jordan knelt on it and shone the torch on the two sacks . There was a long slit from top to bottom in each one . Holding the torch in his left hand , Robert Jordan felt in the first sack with his right hand . This was the one that he carried his robe in and it should not be very full . It was not very full . There was some wire in it stillp361but the square wooden box of the exploder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully wrapped and packed detonators . So was the screw-top tin with the fuse and the caps . Robert Jordan felt in the other sack . It was still full of explosive . There might be one packet missing . He stood up and turned to the woman . There is a hollow empty feeling that a man can have when he is waked too early in the morningthat is almost like the feeling of disaster and he had this multiplieda thousand times . " And this is what you call guarding one 's materials , " he said . " I slept with my head against them and one arm touching them , " Pilar told him . " You slept well . " " Listen , " the woman said . " He got up in the night and I said , Where do you go , Pablo ? ' To urinate , woman , ' he told me and I slept again . When I woke again I did not know what time had passed but I thought , when he was not there , that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custom . Then , " she finished miserably , " when he did not come I worried and when 1 worried I felt of the sacks to be sure all was well and there were the slit places and I came to thee . " " Come on , " Robert Jordan said . They were outside now and it was still so near the middle of the night that you could not feel the morning coming . " Can he get out with the horses other ways than by the sentry ? " " Two ways . " " Who 's at the top ? " " Eladio . " Robert Jordan said nothing more until they reached the meadow where the horses were staked out to feed . There were three horses feeding in the meadow . The big bay and the gray were gone . " How long ago do you think it was he left you ? " " It must have been an hour . " " Then that is that , " Robert Jordan said . " I go to get what is left of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will guard them . " " Que va , you will guard them . You 've guarded them once already . " " Ingle 's , " the woman said , " I feel in regard to this as you do . There is nothing I would not do to bring back thy property . You have no need to hurt me . We have both been betrayed by Pablo . " As she said this Robert Jordan realized that he could not afford the luxury of being bitter , that he could not quarrel with this woman . He had to work with this woman on that day that was already two hours and more gone . He put his hand on her shoulder . " It is nothing , Pilar , " he told her . " What is gone is of small importance . We shall improvise something that will do as well . " " But what did he take ? " " Nothing , woman . Some luxuries that one permits oneself . " " Was it part of thy mechanism for the exploding ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the exploding . Tell me , did Pablo not have caps and fuse ? Surely they would have equipped him with those . " " He has taken them , " she said miserably . " I looked at once for them . They are gone , too . " They walked back through the woods to the entrance of the cave . " Get some sleep , " he said . " We are better off with Pablo gone . " " I go to see Eladio . " " He will have gone another way . " " I go anyway . I have betrayed thee with my lack of smartness . " " Nay , " he said . " Get some sleep , woman . We must be under way at four . " He went into the cave with her and brought out the two sacks , carrying them held together in both arms so that nothing could spill from the slits . " Let me sew them up . " " Before we start , " he said softly . " I take them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I must have them early to sew them . " " You shall have them early , " he told her . " Get some sleep , woman . " " Nay , " she said . " I have failed thee and I have failed the Republic . " " Get thee some sleep , woman , " he told her gently . " Get thee somesleep . " P363THE fascists held the crests of the hills here . Then there was a valley that no one held except for a fascist post in a farmhouse with its outbuildings and its barn that they had fortified . Andres , on his way to Golz with the message from Robert Jordan , made a wide circle around this post in the dark . He knew where there was a trip wire laid that fired a set-gun and he located it in the dark , stepped over it , and started along the small stream bordered with poplars whose leaves were moving with the night wind . A cock crowed at the farmhouse that was the fascist post and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through the trunks of the poplars , a light showing at the lower edge of one of the windows of the farmhouse . The night was quiet and clear and Andres left the stream and struck across the meadow . There were four haycocks in the meadow that had stood there ever since the fighting in July of the year before . No one had ever carried the hay away and the four seasons that had passed had flattenedthe cocks and made the hay worthless . Andres thought what a waste it was as he stepped over a trip wire that ran between two of the haycocks . But the Republicans would have had to carry the hay up the steep Guadarrama slope that rose beyond the meadow and the fascists did not need it , I suppose , he thought . They have all the hay they need and all the grain . They have much , he thought . But we will give them a blow tomorrow morning . Tomorrow morning we will give them something for Sordo . What barbarians they are ! But in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get this message-taking over and be back for the attack on the posts in the morning . Did he really want to get back though or did he only pretend he wanted to be back ? He knew the reprieved feeling he had felt when the Ingles had told him he was to go with the message . He had faced the prospect of the morn- ing calmly . It was what was to be done . He had voted for it and would do it . The wiping out of Sordo had impressed him deeply . But , after all , that was Sordo . That was not them . What they had to do they would do . But when the Ingles had spoken to him of the message he had felt the way he used to feel when he was a boy and he had wakened in the morning of the festival of his village and heard it raining hard so that he knew that it would be too wet and that the bullbaiting in the square would be cancelled . He loved the bullbaiting when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment when he would be in the square in the hot sun and the dust with the carts ranged all around to close the exits and to make a closed place into which the bull would come , sliding down out of his box , braking with all four feet , when they pulled the end-gate up . He looked forward with excitement , delight and sweating fear to the moment when , in the square , he would hear the clatter of the bull 's horns knocking against the wood of his travelling box , and then the sight of him as he came , sliding , braking out into the square , his head up , his nostrils wide , his ears twitching , dust in the sheen of his black hide , dried crut splashed on his flanks , watching his eyes set wide apart , unblinking eyes under the widespreadhorns as smooth and solid as driftwood polished by the sand , the sharp tips uptilted so that to see them did something to your heart . He looked forward all the year to that moment when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day when you watched his eyes while he made his choice of whom in the square he would attack in that sudden head-lowering , horn-reaching , quick cat-gallop that stopped your heart dead when it started . He had looked forward to that moment all the year when he was a boy ; but the feeling when the . Ingles gave the order about the message was the same as when you woke to hear the reprieve of the rain falling on the slate roof , against the stone wall and into the puddles on the dirt street of the village . He had always been very brave with the bull in those village capeas , as brave as any in the village or of the other near-by villages , and not for anything would he have missed it any year although he did not go to the ca peas of other villages . He was able to wait still when the bull charged and only jumped aside at the last moment . HeP365waved a sack under his muzzle to draw him off when the bull had some one down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the bull had some one on the ground and pulled sideways on the horn , had slapped and kicked him in the face until he left the man to charge some one else . He had held the bull 's tail to pull him away from a fallen man , bracing hard and pulling and twisting . Once he had pulled the tail around with one hand until he could reach a horn with the other and when the bull had lifted his head to charge him he had run backwards , circling with the bull , holding the tail in one hand and the horn in the other until the crowd had swarmed onto the bull with their knives and stabbed him . In the dust and the heat , the shouting , the bull and man and wine smell , he had been in the first of the crowd that threw themselves onto the bull and he knew the feeling when the bull rocked and bucked under him and he lay across the withers with one arm locked around the base of the horn and his hand holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body tossed and wrenched and his left arm felt as though it would tear from the socket while he lay on the hot , dusty , bristly , tossing slope of muscle , the ear clenched tight in his teeth , and drove his knife again and again and again into the swelling , tossing bulge of the neck that was now spouting hot on his fist as he let his weight hang on the high slope of the withers and banged and banged into the neck . The first time he had bit the ear like that and held onto it , his neck and jaws stiffened against the tossing , they had all made fun of him afterwards . But though they joked him about it they had great respect for him . And every year after that he had to repeat it . They called him the bulldog of Villaconejos and joked about him eating cattle raw . But every one in the village looked forward to seeing him do it and every year he knew that first the bull would come out , then there would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yelled for the rush for the killing he would place himself to rush through the other attackers and leap for his hold . Then , , when it was over , and the bull settled and sunk dead finally under the weight of the killers , he would stand up and walk away ashamed of the ear part , but also as proud as a man could be . And he would go through the carts to wash his hands at the stone fountain
