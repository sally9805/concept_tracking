Since Pearl Harbor , Wisconsin 's keen , bouncy Senator Robert Marion La Follette Jr. , a prewar isolationist , has maintained an almost-unbroken silence on foreign affairs . Last week , at the convention of his own Progressive Party , he spoke . War has not changed Bob La Follette very much . Said he : <P> " Progressives are realists . They know that the United States can not buy the friendship of other nations . . . . Progressives will not cooperate in any efforts to force the United States to buy an international pig in a beautiful poke . . . . " Then the Progressive Party framed its foreign-policy plank : " Our greatest contribution to world peace will be determined by what America does for Americans . " <P> Significance : in Wisconsin , whose defeat of Wendell Willkie was hopefully interpreted by some internationalists as no setback for internationalism , shrewd Bob La Follette still chooses to rest his party 's election-year chances on a strongly nationalist foreign policy .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
