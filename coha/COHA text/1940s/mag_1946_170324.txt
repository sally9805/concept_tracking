The luckiest seeds in nature are swallowed by birds , then dropped on their future sprouting places encased in pellets of fertilizer . Fruits and berries tempt birds to serve as airborne seed-planters . <P> What nature finds successful , man does well to copy . So thought Dr. Lytle S. Adams of San Diego , who likes to think up new jobs for airplanes . This month , backed by U.S. Government funds , he is flying back &; forth across the denuded pasture lands of the Papago Indian Reservation in Arizona . From his Bellanca Pacemaker drops a stream of pellets . <P> Each of the pea-sized pellets contains in a clay matrix a few husked germs of Lehmann 's Lovegrass ( a hardy , dry-weather forage crop ) , a dash of fertilizer and a pinch of insect- &-rodent; repellent . Scattered from a " centrifugal planter " ( a rimless wheel with spokes of finch pipe ) , they will seed a swath about 1,000 ft. wide , at the rate of one pellet per square foot . If moisture , sun and temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double-quick time of 48 hours , and each will start life with a helpful inheritance of rich , fertile soil . <P> If this new seeding method makes the Papago Reservation lush with Lovegrass , Dr. Adams intends to try it on other denuded regions in the dry Southwest . He looks forward to the time when his man-made bird-pellets will be used to reseed all Western rangelands every ten years .
