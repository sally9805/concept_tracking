A Swiss came out of Germany , wrote in the Neue Zrcher Zeitung of German city workers ' " incredible toughness . " But he added : " It is quite clear that the Allies ' air offensive has already affected this spirit considerably . " And then : " Traffic in the raided cities is difficult and takes a long time . The smallest task demands an effort . . . . Why exert yourself , if you may be dead tomorrow ? . . . The people are so tired they crave for the end of everything at any cost . " <P> Echoed another Swiss paper , Berner Tagwacht : " In reply to Goebbels ' war cry : ' Let them come , ' most Germans say with a suppressed sigh : ' If they would only come . ' "
