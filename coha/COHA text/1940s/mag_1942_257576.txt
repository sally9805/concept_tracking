For days , the fall of Sevastopol had been near . But the Russians had been stubborn . German artillery blazed point-blank at the concrete , steel and limestone of Maxim Gorki " Fort . Bombs chewed great craters in its upper levels . At 800 yards , then at 500 , the mouths of the fort 's 13-in guns yawned at the attackers , so close that the pressure from the blasts crushed tanks and men , and the orange and crimson flames seemed to singe the dead . When the Germans at last swarmed over the fort , a Nazi radio reporter 's voice crackled with epic exasperation : <P> " Although the upper stories of Maxim Gorki Fort are in our hands and the battle line has moved some 1,400 yards forward . Soviet soldiers deep under ground in the lower stories continue to resist . We have sent negotiators to explain to them that further resistance is useless , but they wo n't come out . . . . " So it was at every fort and pillbox , on all the stinking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun and there were always more Germans and Rumanians to be killed . So it was at Balaklava , eight miles south of the city , where the Rumanians astounded the world , charging and charging again until they took the town . So it was in the British Cemetery , now a battleground , where lay Tennyson 's Six Hundred and thousands of other Britons who died , unrhymed , during the siege of 1854-55 . <P> In the Crimean War the British , French and Turks besieged Sevastopol for 329 days before the city fell . Last week , eight months after the Germans first approached Sevastopol , 23 days after Colonel General Fritz Erich von Manstein began his final assault , Berlin announced : " Sevastopol has fallen , over the bastion , city and harbor German and Rumanian war flags are flying . " It was almost true . For two more days the killing went on . Under the wings of the Luftwaffe , from the city 's bombed and blazing docks , the Russian Black Sea Fleet still rescued troops , commanders , wounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last ship had gone and Moscow announced : " On the order of the Supreme Command of the Red Army , Soviet troops on July 3 evacuated Sevastopol . " Then the rear guards and the surviving civilians retired to Khersones Peninsula , where they could kill Germans until the last Russian had fallen . <P> Cost . Moscow said that Sevastopol had cost the Germans 60,000 dead , 90,000 prisoners and wounded , 300 planes and 250 tanks in the final 25 days , 300,000 casualties in the whole eight months ; that the Red Army had lost only 11,385 dead , 21,090 wounded , 8,300 prisoners , 300 guns , 77 planes , 30 tanks . Perhaps Moscow was still prone to exaggerate the Red Army 's earned glory . But the Nazi accounts were proof that the Germans and Rumanians had indeed paid dearly . <P> " A victory for Soviet arms , " Moscow called the siege , on the theory that keeping some 300,000 men , 900 planes , 400 tanks and many guns occupied for so long was in itself a strategical triumph . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crimea , the Red Navy 's last important base on the Black Sea and a southern road to the Caucasus . <P> After their mauling before Sevastopol , Manstein 's troops probably had to rest and refit , but the Luftwaffe air fleet could fly immediately to the Kursk-Kharkov fronts . Fritz Erich von Manstein had earned his quick promotion to Field Marshal .
