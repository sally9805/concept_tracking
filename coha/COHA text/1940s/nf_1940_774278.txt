txt  | imported brands of Portland from England , Germany , and Belgium , because American Portland cement had not established itself yet , and was not highly regarded . However , the contractor , not satisfied with a decent profit , stamped the work and , through the blindness or perhaps worse of the city 's inspectors , sometimes omitted the mortar in the brick joints and left large cavities behind the brick lining , for which he expected to be paid as rubble masonry . It was the practice in building the arch to build both sides up to the key . The bricklayers placed the backing as they came up . The key , about two feet wide , was done at night ? one bricklayer working on it backing out from the completed section of arch , and placing the rubble masonry backing it up as he came along . Of course it was difficult to inspect the work as the bricklayer occupied the space , but a good inspector would have known what was going on . That was where most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the night and he had to finish before morning . If the stone backing above was unusually heavy , or if he was lazy , he would place but one ring of brick instead of the required three or more in the key , leaving a void or cavity above . Every few feet he would place a bridge of brickwork to make it appear that he was doing a good job . At the end of his shift he would finish up the face of the work where he quit , so that the engineer looking at it casually would think it well done . One day while walking through the tunnel with a long rod in my hand I tapped the piece of key recently placed , and it gave a hollow sound . I noted the brick was loose and reported the occurrence to Gowen who , being in controversy with the contractor about the bad  | work , said he would use it as part of his ammunition , and suggested that I leave it as it was as an exhibit when the time came . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contractor . There was lack of cooperation on his part and a disregard for the engineers ' orders . When Gowen was inspecting the work I reported that the superintendent had refused to remove some masonry that I had condemned . He repeated my order to the superintendent , and on his refusal to obey ordered him to shut down the work . The superintendent refused to do this . Gowen ordered me to measure up the work as of that date , omitting the condemned part , and to make an estimate for payment for anything done after that date . When the end of the month came the contractor noted what had been done and complained to the chief engineer about Gowen 's action . Gowen remarked to me that they could fire him , but that no power on earth could make him sign an estimate . The contractor kept on for another month and no estimate was returned for it . Charges were then preferred against Gowen and Division Engineer Alfred Craven who was having similar experiences , and this led to a hullabaloo . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought he never realized how bad the conditions were . They kept getting worse , until they came to the attention of the legislature , which appointed a commission to investigate the matter , under Senator J. Sloat Fassett . This investigation was very thorough and sensational , the result being that legislation was enacted removing the existing commission and empowering the mayor of New York , Abram S. Hewitt , to appoint a new commission of five members to carry on .  | This was done and a new board of high caliber , headed by James C. Duane , a former chief of engineers of the United States Army , took hold . The new commission immediately started to investigate conditions , and found out that the engineers ' complaints if anything were underestimated . A reorganization of the engineering force was effected , dropping some of the division and other engineers , and consolidating the work under the direction of Mr. Gowen and Mr. Craven , who had borne the brunt of the fight for honest work . At the same time Mr. Fteley , an engineer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made chief engineer changing places with Mr. Church , who became consulting engineer . This was in the early part of 1888 . Extensive repairs were undertaken involving the removal and replacing of much defective brick and masonry , and grouting the work from one end to the other . My recollection is that three hundred thousand barrels of natural cement were used for the latter job . The contractor was required to do this at his own expense , and his own force was reorganized with new blood introduced into it . The grouting work was probably the most extensive work of its kind ever done at that time . It was systematically done . Ten or more holes were drilled through the brickwork at intervals of ten feet and a mixture of one-to-one grout was forced in by manually operated pumps . Usually six men were required at the handles when resistance was heavy . The grout was mixed in two long wooden boxes , the suction hose being shifted from one to the other as each box was emptied . The grout was forced in the bottom holes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , the  | grout appearing at the successively higher holes sometimes being forced clear over the key , and sometimes for a hundred feet or more horizontally back of the brickwork . First water would appear in the upper grout holes ; then when the grout began to come out of the hole it was plugged to prevent waste . Cutting out some of the work for test purposes we uncovered an empty cement barrel that had been placed in a cavity when the scamp work was in progress , and it was thoroughly filled with grout . When the repair work was finished a fairly creditable job was left behind and the aqueduct has continued in use until this time . I have never heard of any trouble with it . During the repair work it was necessary to keep an up-to-date graphical record of it . Mr. Gowen conceived the idea of plotting the progress of the repairs and the grouting on a roll of profile paper , with proper symbols to show the amount of grout pumped into each hole , and the amount of brickwork and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to collect the data for all this and frequently took the measurements in the tunnel , plotting the results after I came out covered with tunnel dirt . In those days we mixed our own India ink and colors and I was quite proud of my profile diagram . One day Mr. Gowen came to the office and asked to see the profile , which I promptly produced with considerable pride . When I opened it up he threw up his hands and said , " What dabster did this ? " ? quite a blow to my pride ! But looking back I am willing to admit that while correct it was not a work of art . When the scamp work was going on there was a story along the line to the effect that one day when a cont ractor was walking through the tunnel he saw a mule 's  | hoof projecting through one of the weep holes which were left at intervals to bleed the rock . He called his superintendent and promptly discharged him ? not for dumping the dead mule behind the wall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . This story was undoubtedly an exaggeration but it showed the spirit prevailing at that time . All of the experience with this aqueduct masonry work described was most unpleasant and trying , and I am glad that I never had to repeat it . When all the facts about the defective work were made public ? of course in exaggerated form ? everyone connected with the job received a black mark as far as the public was concerned . Those of us who came through the fight for good work often wondered whether it might not have been better for us to quit earlier , and not have stayed to fight against the bad work . But I hold the opinion that it was right for us to do what we did . There were many times when the case seemed hopeless , but we juniors were supported to the limit by Gowen and Craven . We were justified by the results . Perhaps I should mention the big storm of March 12 , 1888 , known hereabouts as " the blizzard . " I had gone to Cranford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lillie A. Littell , to whom I was engaged , and spent Sunday night at my father 's home in Brooklyn . It was snowing when I reached Brooklyn . Early Monday morning I arose and ate the breakfast that the maid , Mary Fay , had prepared for me , and started out to get my train for Croton Lake . This train started from the terminal of the west side elevated railroad at 155th Street and Eighth Avenue , and ran over the New York and Northern , now the Putnam division of the New  | York Central . It was snowing hard then and the wind was blowing hard . Reaching the Brooklyn Bridge I was surprised to find no trains running over it . In those days the trains running over the bridge were local affairs pulled by cable . So I hastened to the foot of Fulton Street , Brooklyn , and crossed on the old Fulton ferry . It was then getting late to catch my elevated connecting train , so I ran up Fulton Street , Manhattan , in knee-deep snow . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L " I saw several trains stalled and could see no way to get to 155th Street . I hung around all day making several calls and ran across Larned and Thurston Culyer , all the time keeping my eye on the elevated trains . Near evening I boarded one for uptown and managed to reach 155th Street . Rounding the high curve at ' loth Street the wind was so strong that some of the nervous passengers feared the train would be blown to the street , and at the next station ( 116th Street ) begged a fat man who was getting off to stay with them for ballast . No trains were running over the Northern Railroad , and there were no prospects of any that night , so I started back downtown on the elevated . At Fifty-third Street the train was stalled , so I walked to the Murray Hill Hotel at Park Avenue and Fortieth Street , and was apparently given the last room ? a stock broker 's with instruments in it . The snowdrifts in places hid the lower windows of the houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day there were no trains , and it was not until late Wednesday afternoon that I succeeded in getting a Hudson River train to Sing Sing . I put up over night at the old American Hotel there . I was worrying about what was happening on the work without me.  | The next morning , Thursday , I collected the mail for Croton Dam and started out on foot for the old dam , about six or seven miles . The last mile the road was unbroken and the snow was literally up to my hips in places , so the going was not easy . Colonel John Mechan , topographical engineer for the old Department of Public Works of New York City , lived in a farmhouse in this last stretch , and I stopped to leave his mail , finding him there . He opened a pint of good Burgundy to show me his appreciation , and we finished it together . When I arrived at the little field office the boys who were there reported no excitement , but wondered what had been going on in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several days . Included in the subdivision under my charge as assistant engineer was the so-called New Croton gatehouse ? the head work controlling the new aqueduct . It was an exceptional piece of work for those days on account of the large rock-cut required for it . Mr. Fteley called it " the half million stopcock . " It really cost more than that ? nearly a million as I recall it on account of the increase in the amount of excavation required . It was a complicated structure with a fourteen foot circular inlet tunnel , about six hundred feet long , from the existing Croton Lake . It also provided for three additional inlets at different levels from the proposed New Croton Reservoir , outlets to the old and new aqueducts , a large screen chamber , and other chambers in front of it all , extending both ways , a long high wall to serve as a retaining wall for a highway between it and the gatehouse when the new Croton Lake would be in service .  | The old aqueduct ran at the base of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was responsible for its maintenance , would not allow interference with it because it was then practically the sole source for the city 's water supply . The new gatehouse was therefore thrown back into the hill to avoid the old aqueduct . This location required , as I recall , about two hundred thousand cubic yards of rock excavation , for which the contractor bid two dollars and fifty cents per cubic yard . The back face of the cut was about two hundred feet high , measured from the bottom of the gate chambers to the surface . The contract drawings showed an impossible vertical slope from subgrade ( elevation 134 to elevation 270 ) then a ten foot berm and an eight-on-one slope above to the surface . Anyone who has worked in rock knows how difficult it would be to maintain such a deep cut with such vertical slopes . Perhaps the contractor had this in mind when he bid his rock price . The result was that there was constant pressure to order more liberal slopes , and the engineer rather grudgingly recognized the wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , until finally the cut was excavated to about a three-ontwo slope . Every month , winter and summer , this cut had to be cross-sectioned for estimate payment purposes , and in the winter when the slopes were covered with ice it was no easy job ? in fact quite hazardous . This work was done with slope boards ? that is , a board ten feet long graduated to half a foot with a carpenter 's level bubble set in its upper edge . The cross section would start from a known distance and elevation at the top of the slit , and a long vertical rod would be carried to another  | known distance and elevation point at the surface . For safety a long rope was tied to a tree and hung from the top , and the rodmen would cling to this while climbing the slope ? a transit at the bottom keeping the party in line . A sixteen foot vertical rod was often too short for the vertical readings in which case a tape , hung from the slope rod , would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nerve required to rest one 's toes on a projection of rock only two or three inches wide , clinging to a rope with one hand , and holding a ten foot rod with a tape suspended with the other , and bringing the rod to a level position . Larned was great at this because he was strong and without fear . I usually kept the notes and followed along . Occasionally the shaking of the rope would dislodge some loose rock , and it would roll down the side of the cut . We would have to dodge it as it came down . Looking back , it seems a wonder that no one was killed or injured , but we all escaped without harm . While the work on the gatehouse was in progress I witnessed what seemed a most miraculous escape from death . The pit had been sunk practically to grade . I was working with the engineering party in the bottom . About fifty feet above on the northeast corner a shelf was excavated to bring the upper inlet into the gatehouse , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outer one passing material to the one nearest the cut . One of the guys of the outer derrick let go and the mast fell striking the boom of the second derrick and swinging it round over the pit . In those days a tag rope was used to swing the boom around with the aid of a " tag man . " It was before the days of the bull wheel which enabled the boom to be swung round by the engine . The tag rope was neatly  | coiled on the shelf at the edge of the fifty foot pit and inside the coil the tag man remained standing , probably because he was unnerved by what had happened . As the boom swung over the pit it pulled the tag rope with it . The rope knotted around the tag man 's ankles and pulled him off the edge , so that he swung like a pendulum head down over the cut . Fortunately the hoist runner did not lose his head and stood by his engine , slowly lowering the tag man to the bottom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the rope . He was not severely hurt , but I heard later that he lost all his hair ? probably from shock . I do not believe such a thing could happen once in a million years , and it did seem like a miracle . The gatehouse , as stated , required much attention . With the small party we had to look after it , and the one and a half miles of aqueduct tunnel , we were kept busy , and it was necessary to do much of the estimate and office work at night , so that our working day was quite long . I used to be scolded by my superior ( not Mr. Gowen ) for turning the estimates in so late in the month , though I was working every minute ; but I had to take this as part of the game . One of the appurtenant features of the gatehouse was the fourteen-foot-diameter circular inlet tunnel , six hundred feet long , tapping the old Croton Lake , at least one half of it on a curve . I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill surface time and again , and were never satisfied with the result . However , when the tunnel holed through into shaft zero ? our first holing-through experience ? the lines checked with a variation of only one-sixteenth of an inch , which gave us much confidence in running the longer headings of the main aqueduct.  | The inlet chamber of the lake was excavated behind a barrier of natural rock , left in place for the purpose of acting as a coffer dam . After the inlet tunnel was driven the rock was perforated with horizontal drill holes , their depth being determined by cross section diagrams of the rock below the lake surface , and they were loaded with a huge charge of high-grade dynamite . Meanwhile , as a precaution directed by Mr. Fteley , a dam or bulkhead of twelve-by-twelve yellow pine timbers had been erected in a notch cut in the brick lining of the tunnel to close the masonry portal of the tunnel . One Saturday afternoon all was ready to shoot . However , the contractor had not completed some finishing work in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the blast was fired . I directed him , in spite of his protest , to delay firing until this was done . With the experience of years I probably would have managed this differently , but the contractor obeyed and finished up the work that night . So the shot was fired the following morning ( Sunday ) ? Gowen and the rest of us watching it from the other side of the lake . The contractor sublet the removal of the subaqueous muck to a diving concern ; the yardage was small but it took practically all winter to remove it . I do n't know why . Some of the trouble was caused by the subcontractor leaving his slopes too steep , and when he would pull out a rock at the bottom of the mass the side would cave in . He used to argue with me that it would be well to leave in much of the loose rock to help screen the water entering the tunnel , but the argument did not appeal to me . He finally finished the work . The building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in depth , faced with cut stone was a most interesting task . The heavy cut stone masonry for  | facing the chambers interested me . It was very massive . The contractors were Smith and Brown , on whose work such scamp practices as those of the tunnel contractors did not occur , and they gave us a creditable job . Being accustomed to railroad construction they were not used to the refinements of hydraulic work and , with the experience everyone has had since , a better job would be done today , but it would probably cost more . It was a monumental and impressive work . The superstructure building was built later by another contractor , after I had been transferred to the Titicus Dam . Looking back now I have often wondered whether money could not have been saved by locating the structure not so far back into the hill . Of course this would have required relocating or by-passing the existing aqueduct and that would have cost money . But it would have saved such an enormous amount of rock excavation that , I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end . Perhaps this had been considered and turned down , but I never heard that it was . The New Croton Aqueduct was placed in service in 189o . In the spring or early summer of that year I was sent to Purdy 's Station to take charge as assistant engineer of the construction of Titicus Dam and the reservoir of the Croton system known as reservoir " M. " The reservoir was to have an estimated capacity of over seven billion gallons . The work for the dam had recently been let to the firm of Washburn , Shaler and Washburn . The two junior members were graduates of the engineering school of Cornell . Mr. Shaler had been an assistant engineer with the Aqueduct Commission on the construction of the 135th Street gatehouse .  | The Titicus Dam was an earth and masonry dam . The masonry part reached a maximum height of one hundred thirty-five feet and included a masonry overall two hundred feet in length , earth wings with masonry core walls carrying the wings into the hills north and south . The north wing required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet ? a work of considerable magnitude for those days . Mr. Gowen was the division engineer in charge , but continued his residence at Ossining so that he could attend to the closing of the aqueduct contracts . But he visited the dam frequently , showing his interest in it until the contract for the great New Croton Dam was let in 1900 , when he was given charge of that . The work at Purdy 's was transferred to Division Engineer Alfred Craven , who also had charge of a similar job for reservoir " D " at Carmel and who continued in charge until completion in 1895 . Mrs. Ridgway and I took up our residence in a boarding house at Purdy 's Station kept by Mr. and Mrs. George H. Godwin . ( Mrs. Godwin died in 1936 at the age of eighty-three . ) In 1892 we started housekeeping for the first time in the old " Barlow " farmhouse in the village of Somers , a mile west of Purdy 's . It was a place of no conveniences , but there was an apple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season , shipping them to our friends . Mrs. Ridgway enjoyed it , for it was her first experience at housekeeping . In the following spring we were obliged to move because the house was sold . We moved to Mount Kisco and lived in a hired cottage until the work at Purdy 's was about finished . The party under me consisted of the " war horse " Larned and others , some of whom I can recall . William  | A. Hoe Jr . joined us first at Croton Dam following his graduation from New York University in 1889 . He came of a fine old New York family who had been builders doing work for such firms as Tiffany and Company . He was a great help to me but in a few years felt obliged to resign to assist his father in his business , and a few years later died . He held the post of rodman . E. E. de Lancey held the rank of leveler . Later on he was transferred to the New Croton Dam . " Dick " Reinisch soon got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H. D. Grannis was a rodman who remained throughout the work . Later on he acted as a superintendent for one of the contractors on the Catskill Aqueduct and then retired from engineering work . Eddie Mezger was an axman , who had much to do with the testing of cement and other odd jobs , making himself generally useful ? a very faithful man . William Whalen , an axman or laborer who had been with me at Croton Dam , was of the party and remained until he secured a transfer on maintenance work for the Sodom Reservoir . He was quite garrulous and full of old-fashioned Irish sayings , such as when describing a piece of work which he regarded as a hard task , " Me shirt was wet to me back , saving your presence . " He lived on a small farm where he could raise vegetables and flowers of which he was fond . On the walls of the best room was a painting which he had been told was very valuable and when a visitor would call Whalen would insist on his getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Later on in the middle of the job Macrae Sykes came , a son of Major General George Sykes of Gettysburg fame where he commanded the Fifth Corps . Macrae was a strong young man , very likable but tempera-  | mental . He should have been an artist . Robert H. Jacobs was there for a short time , a graduate of Cornell who showed much aptitude , later developing into an engineer of considerable ability . After transferring to the rapid transit work he reached the grade of division engineer in charge of track work for subway building , from which he retired in 1934 . All of the property surveys for land required by the Aqueduct Commission for its dams and other works were made by the Department of Public Works . This department was developed in 1898 into the Department of Water Supply , Gas , and Electricity , of which at the time George W. Birdsall was the chief engineer . One of his staff was Thurston Culyer , who came to live at Purdy 's . Culyer has now left us . He died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter . With the cooperation of the contractor Mr. Gowen organized the work at Purdy 's to produce fine results , especially the masonry work . We had a fine group of inspectors : J. H. Slingerland , Isaac H. Thomas , George H. Langler , George Tillottson , John R. Soper , Roland B. Vose . Langler particularly was a " cracker-jack " as an organizer . I am convinced that every stone in the structure was carefully and fully bedded , and that no voids were left in the mass . Every stone was picked up one or more times to insure its thorough bedding . The masonry of the Titicus Dam was of old massive rubble type , and the exposed faces were laid up with cut stone . The quarry was on Jenkins Hill about a mile north of the work . The rises of the cut stone courses varied from two and a half feet at the bottom to about fifteen inches at the top . The stretchers were two and a half feet deep and the headers about six feet ? two stretchers , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ batter on the downstream face was six inches to the foot , and the stones were cut normal to this batter , in other words they were set on sloping beds . One can imagine the difficulty when told that no wedges were allowed in the bed joints , and that the stone must be true to line and grade . Some years later concrete masonry took the place of old-fashioned rubble , and one seldom hears now of rubble masonry dams . Concrete is undoubtedly better for many reasons . The art of dam building has developed very much , due largely to the great structures of the Bureau of Reclamation . I much regret , however , the disappearance of the old hydraulic stone mason . Most of the masons of today are not in their class . Although they build neat work which makes a good appearance , it is not of the water-tight quality of the old dams ? such as my old friend , Andy Haldane ( with his " wee bit hammer " ) , and his associates used to build . Work was suspended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and early spring when Portland cement was used the masonry was laid in natural cement ? a mistake , I am convinced , for the natural cement mortar did not stand the winter , and the only seepage through the structure was due to its use . I would never use it on any such structure in this climate again if I had the decision . The makings for the earth portion of the dam , and the methods of placing it , were not of the best , and there was some settlement of the high bank after the water was admitted to the reservoir . However , the settlement was made good and so far as I know there has been no trouble with the bank since . Some years later when dam structures were investigated by a commission of engineers , appointed by the new chief engineer , Wil-  | Liam R. Hill , the exploration of Titicus Dam showed a saturated bank on the upstream side , as did most of the other earth dams , but practically an impervious core wall . The roads around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property , built under a separate contract , were practically complete before I left Purdy 's . What remained to be done was completed under the efficient direction of A. S. Nye , a graduate of Cornell , who was left for that purpose . He was a transitman , as I remember , who had been on the work eight years or more . On the completion of the Titicus Dam I was transferred to the Jerome Park Reservoir in the Bronx in the spring of 1895 , taking with me the remnants of the party at Titicus . Sykes , Grannis , and some others , came with me . Mr. Craven was still my division engineer . A year or so before , Larned had resigned to try his hand at mining work in Montana , accompanied by Billy Armstrong . This was a great loss to the work because his strong character and skill were valuable assets . Armstrong had tried a variety of enterprises since we had been together in Montana , and when he finally looked me up he was appointed as axman and assigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Titicus Dam . He grew restless for want of excitement and induced Larned to go to Butte with him to exploit a new process for reducing ore for which he had the agency . It did not pan out and they separated , Larned taking up work with one of the silver mining companies with which he remained a number of years . Armstrong died some years later . Mrs. Ridgway and I moved from Westchester County  | at the beginning of the Jerome Park work . We engaged a cottage at 2688 Creston Avenue , north of Kingsbridge Road ? not very attractive but handy to the work . The following spring we moved to Sedgwick Avenue ( west side of the reservoir ) a few doors south of number 3377 where my friend of later years , James Pilkington , lived . Then in the spring of 1898 we moved to Edenwood ( later called Grand ) Avenue , to a cottage belonging to a Mrs. Oakley whose husband was a tea taster ? the first house north of Fordham Road on the cast side . Edenwood Avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty little cottage and we enjoyed it for over two years , until in the fall of igoo we moved to an apartment at 504 West 143rd Street , Manhattan , because I was engaged on rapid transit work . The Jerome Park work between Jerome and Sedgwick Avenues was principally an excavation job . The mass of rock and earth removed amounted to approximately seven million cubic yards , and the contractor was given about seven years to complete the job . Two basins were provided for ? one east , the other west , of the Old Croton Aqueduct which separated them , and which had to be reconstructed through the flooded area . It then formed a division wall between the two basins . The reservoir as designed was to have been over a mile long and a half mile wide . It was located on the top of the ridge north of Kingsbridge Road , its southern limit . It was named for the celebrated old race track which took up most of the east basin . The restraining dams or dikes on the perimeter were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter resting on rock , but in some cases at the south end where the rock was too deep they were founded on earth resembling quicksand .  | There was a central gatehouse in the west basin controlling the flow into the reservoir from the Old and the New Croton Aqueducts . This gatehouse was located near the dividing wall with connections to both aqueducts . The flow from the latter was brought in by a conduit a mile long , controlled by a small gatehouse ( No. i ) near shaft twenty of the new aqueduct , just north of where the conduit became under pressure . The new aqueduct was under pressure and passed deeply under Jerome Park Reservoir . There was a connection to it from the central gatehouse through shaft twenty-one . There were four other gatehouses located at the dikes at various points of the perimeter of the reservoir ? two for the east and two for the west basins , each designed to connect with the city 's mains by means of two forty-eight-inch pipes . Within the area were several natural mounds of high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One was the hill on which the clubhouse of the race track was located . Another was in the west basin ? not so high ? where the Oak Ridge club had been , which was used as an engineering office until it was necessary to excavate it . When that time came a new stone house was built by the Commission at the north end of the east basin , on a hill outside the flow line of the new reservoir . It was used eventually for the keeper , but was abandoned when the hill and house were taken away twenty years later to build a rapid transit car shed for the Jerome Avenue line . Nothing seems to " stay put " in this big town ! Fine buildings are erected and long before their usefulness has passed they are torn down to make room for larger ones . We see pictures of subway entrances in European cities , for instance , beautifully ornate , ornaments to  | their environment , but here no one would think of building thus , knowing that they would be replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more practical than esthetic , but it seems that we have gone too far in the utilitarian direction . J. B. McDonald , to whom the contract for the Jerome Park Reservoir had been awarded , had made a reputation for himself on other work . His previous accomplishment , as a member of the firm of Ryan and McDonald , was the construction of the tunnel for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad under the streets of Baltimore . He was a man of forceful personality and had as advisers Harry B. Reed ( who became his sonin-law ) and Harry C. Sanford , who later became chief engineer with the Degnon Construction Company , executing a number of major aqueduct and subway projects . Sanford was an exceptionally high grade man , quiet , practical , and efficient . He began as a telegraph operator in an Ohio town , and in his quiet but forceful way made a record and worked up to an important position in the engineering world . An incident regarding him is worth mentioning . In the early stages of the work at Jerome Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team came along with a load of iron rails . We both rushed out to stop it , but realizing its heavy load and that it was on a down grade we hesitated to grab the bridle for fear of being thrown . Sanford saw what was happening from his office window , ran out , and without hesitation grabbed the bridle , stopping the team . Fortunately he was not injured . His untimely death about 1926 was regretted by all his friends .  | A cousin of Sanford 's , Ernest A. Herrick , was also on the construction staff as a foreman or some similar position . He developed into a very successful contractor and executed a number of subway contracts . As he was always quiet and efficient I felt at ease when he was on the job , knowing that the work would be well done . We brought most of the inspectors from Titicus and Carmel . With perhaps one or two exceptions they were faithful and efficient . One of the general foremen was " Jimmie " Leary , a likable person with lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a subcontractor . I hope he is still living . The work at Jerome Park went along agreeably for the first year or so . The spoil was deposited in various places in the vicinity , filling in low ground immediately south of the reservoir , raising Jerome Avenue to the new filled grade for a distance of a mile or two north and south of Kingsbridge Road . A large mass was deposited in the swamp land along the west side of Westchester Creek , several miles east of the reservoir on land which the contractor controlled . To reach this site a standard gauge railroad was built utilizing the old approach from the Harlem Railroad to the race track , and running thence through Bronx Park and along Pelham Parkway . The soft material in the swamp evidently was of great depth because the fill caused an enormous mud wave perhaps fifteen feet high . The fill would be carried along at a certain grade and when the load became too heavy this mud wave would break the surface , and turn it over as though a giant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was McDonald 's intention to develop some real estate project there .  | After several years when it was realized that the job was not proving as profitable as had been anticipated things were not so agreeable . The relations between engineers and contractors became less cordial . The core wall and embankment construction was costly , and McDonald made efforts to change the design so as to substitute a masonry structure in lieu of the embankment with a core wall . These changes were opposed by Mr. Fteley , but in 1899 he resigned on account of ill health , and William R. Hill of Syracuse was appointed in his place . Mr. Hill set out to make extensive changes not only in Jerome Park but at Croton Dam as well . At the latter the core wall and embankment construction at the south end of the structure , built carefully at great expense , was torn out and a masonry section was substituted . At Jerome Park masonry was substituted along Sedgwick Avenue . Mr. Hill had a committee of engineers appointed consisting of J. J. R. Croes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Elnathan Sweet , a former state engineer , and a third member , Professor Burr . This committee made an extensive series of tests of existing structures and attempted to justify some of the changes . However , it seemed to me an engineering mistake to make them , and they resulted in a large additional cost to the city without , in my opinion , commensurate gain . Mr. Craven and Mr. Gowen had also opposed the changes and were not very popular with the new chief or the contractors . The controversy was carried into the technical press and arguments pro and con appeared . Without any given reason Mr. Craven was suddenly transferred to the Croton Basin to take charge  | of certain surveys being made there , relieving Edward Wegmann who was sent to Jerome Park . Wegmann soon let it be known that he was not sympathetic to the changes at Jerome Park . Mr. Craven , feeling that his usefulness with the Aqueduct Commission had ended , due to his disagreement with the chief engineer , sought and obtained an appointment as division engineer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertaking the construction of the first rapid transit subway in New York City . On May 1 , 1900 he reported in his new position . Soon after this Wegmann was sent back to his old assignment in the Croton watershed , and Daniel Ulrich , then chief engineer of the Department of Parks in the Bronx , was appointed division engineer in charge of Jerome Park . Not long after this Mr. Gowen resigned . Before Mr. Ulrich took charge I thought it would be advisable to sever my connection , after serving sixteen years with the Aqueduct Commission , because I felt I was not in sympathy with the chief engineer or the Commission . I likewise sought a transfer to the Rapid Transit Railroad Commission . This was a wise move , as it turned out , and I have oftened wondered why I had not attempted to make the change before . I had been at Jerome Park about five years and the last two of them seemed to have been wasted . The job which had started out so promisingly fell into the doldrums and into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more behind . It had affected the morale of the engineering force . After Mr. Craven and I left , by all accounts , things got worse . There was a serious lack of cooperation between the new division engineer and the subordinates who re-  | mained from the old regime . Mr. Ulrich had difficulty in maintaining discipline . Furthermore , the Merchants Association took up the case , making charges and questioning the judgment and good faith of the Aqueduct Commission and their engineers . A number of hearings were held to which I and others were called as witnesses . Whether these controversies were the cause of it or not , Mr. Hill resigned in 1902 because of ill health . This was during the administration of Seth Low as mayor , and , tired of controversy and desirous of completing the work which had fallen woefully behind , he asked a commission of prominent engineers , including John R. Freeman , Professor Burr , and Clemens Herschel , to recommend a successor to Mr. Hill . They unanimously recommended J. Waldo Smith of the East Jersey Water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , putting new life into the work which was soon pushed to completion . By this time the need for the Jerome Park Reservoir had become less urgent because a new additional water supply had been projected . When the original decision was made in 1895 to build this reservoir as a part of the Croton system the need for it was apparent and the project was justified , but the work dragged on so much that when it was finished the Catskill project was well under way . It is doubtful now whether it would ever have been built , had it not been started previous to the Catskill project , because the Hill View Reservoir with a surface elevation of two hundred ninety-five feet ( about one hundred sixty-five higher than Jerome Park ) would probably have answered the need . It was finally decided to finish up the west basin  | only and to abandon the east one , although excavation for the latter , amounting to millions of cubic yards , had been virtually completed . That was probably the best solution under the circumstances . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original bid for both basins . It is interesting to note what became of some of the engineering staff at Jerome Park . Daniel Ulrich eventually resigned and , according to the 1934 yearbook of the American Society of Civil Engineers , was then assistant division engineer of the State Highway Commission of North Carolina . Herbert C. Alden , who came down with Mr. Craven from Carmel and who succeeded as senior assistant engineer on the work , was transferred to the borough president of the Bronx . He was bright and had he applied himself he would have advanced in his work , but field and routine duties seemed to have little interest for him . Richard Baldwin Jr. , assistant engineer , who also came with Mr. Craven from Carmel , was a most likable chap , not technically educated but liked and respected by his men . He produced good results , and in other work would have been very successful because he had a great deal of force . I will refer to him later in connection with his becoming a subcontractor on the Catskill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supply . He died a few years ago near his boyhood home in Baltimore . A. S. Nye was transferred to the Building Department of Manhattan where he may still be . He was deliberate , able , and sure in his methods , being abso " lutely reliable . Macrae Sykes secured a transfer to the Rapid Transit  | Railroad Commission about 1906 , and worked in my department until I left for the Board of Water Supply . Soon after that he was transferred to the Department of Finance where he worked until his sudden death , July 5 , 1929.  | TRANSFER TO RAPID TRANSIT WORK AS SENIOR ASSISTANT ENGINEER ON May 9 , 1900 I reported to William Barclay Parsons , the chief engineer of the Rapid Transit Railroad Commission , at his office at 320 Broadway , New York . I was assigned to the second division under my old boss , Alfred Craven , who had reported on the first of that month . I was to be his senior assistant engineer at the same pay I had received previously ? twenty-two hundred dollars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transferring to rapid transit work . With a commission free from politics ; a chief engineer comparatively young in years , of strong character and decision and full of enthusiasm , and with an excellent education ; and with a division engineer and assistant engineers on their toes sharing the enthusiasm of their chief , work became a pleasure and everyone put his best efforts into it , resolved to make it a success , and to excel in everything . This favorable interest was shared by the public in general . It was no wonder that I entered into every  | phase of the new activity with pleasure , feeling that I was learning something new every day . I was then thirty-seven years old . Until this new experience came I was feeling discouraged about the prospects for the future . It was refreshing to get rid of the staleness of the old work , which had lost much of its spirit . It put new life into me , and I put forth my best efforts to keep up with the young men working for me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The engineering department , as then organized , provided for a deputy chief engineer , George S. Rice , who had been identified with the rapid transit work in Boston , and who for some time ( 1887 ) had been deputy chief engineer of the Aqueduct Commission , doing good and honest work . He resigned his position about the same time that Mr. Fteley was appointed chief engineer . He handled civil service matters and other details . There was a designing division under St. John Clarke , a native of Virginia and an able designer , with headquarters at 320 Broadway ; his title was general inspector of designs . A division of material inspection was under W. I. Aiken . To give financial strength to the contractor the Rapid Transit Subway Construction Company had been formed with August Belmont , the banker , as president . S. L. F. Deyo , an able engineer formerly with the New Haven Railroad , was made its chief engineer ? an excellent choice . Mr. Deyo had his own staff of assistants and designing force . There was the finest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his staff , both being interested in good quality and progress . Since the contractor was required to maintain and operate the subway for fifty years , as well as build it ,  | he was naturally interested in not only getting early returns but in good work as well ? the better the job the less maintenance he would have to pay for . Two bids had been received in the earlier part of 1900 for the construction of the subway and its elevated extensions . ( The events leading up to the letting of this work are interestingly described in James B. Walker 's Fifty Years of Rapid Transit . ) The bidders were John B. McDonald of Jerome Park Reservoir fame ? for thirty-five million ? and Andrew Onderdonk , who had successfully built some difficult sections of the Canadian Pacific Railroad in the western mountain section , whose bid was thirty-nine million . There were certain features about these bids not necessary to describe here . McDonald took the work complete and sublet the construction . There was some question as to whether the Fortysecond Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or modified so as to provide a connection with the New York Central tracks at Grand Central Station . I recall a magazine article under the name of the contractor , in which the author told of his negotiations with the New York Central for a physical connection between the subway and their station , which came to nothing . He pointed out for the benefit of future observers , who might criticize those in control for not having done this apparently desirable thing , that he was not responsible for its failure . Later developments indicated that such a connection would have been a great mistake , and the judgment of those who decided against the plan was justified . James Pilkington had the credit of turning the first earth for a sewer in connection with the subway work at Chatham Square . The McCabe Brothers of Balti-  | more , whose work included the third division from Io4th Street north , opened up real subway work first . As the third division was not yet organized , the second division was sent to lay out the work for McCabe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consisted of Mr. Craven , Myers , Jacobs , William P. Gay , an axman and I. All of us took turns at the instrument and rods . We cross-sectioned a mile or more of the surface and laid out the first subway at 156th Street excavating where ground was broken with simple ceremonies ? a contrast to later high-hat ceremonies . On June i we returned to our regular work on the second division . The second division , to which I was assigned , was of the four-track type , and extended from Fourth Avenue and Forty-first Street , through Forty-second Street , up Broadway to io4th Street . Subdivision 5A of the second division was under William E. Swift , who had seen service with the Metropolitan Water Board of Massachusetts . Lawrence C. Brink , an engineer with a strong likable character , was his principal assistant . Subdivision 5B had John H. Myers as section engineer , with Bayly Hipkins as assistant at first . Hipkins was a transitman who had been transferred from some other city department . He was quick and exceedingly active , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Archie A. Sproul , who had been transferred from the borough president of the Bronx , was also a section engineer . His chief assistant was Robert H. Jacobs who had come from the Aqueduct Commission . Below the second division was the first , under Albert Carr . Above it to the north was the third , under Beverly R. Value , formerly an assistant engineer on the New Croton Dam . The fourth division and the elevated extension was under Eugene Clapp . The sewer  | division was under Calvin W. Hendrick ( a distant cousin of my friend William Gould ) . This division had charge of the design and construction of new as well as reconstructed sewers , thus relieving the other divisions of that phase of the work . The second division 's office was over Healy 's restaurant at the northeast corner of Sixty-sixth Street and Columbus Avenue ; it also served as a field office for sections 5B and 6A . Before that office was selected Mr. Craven tried to lease a taxpayer 's store recently erected at the northeast corner of Sixty-third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the owner , Wendel , found that it was wanted for the city and cut off negotiations . To my knowledge the building went unrented for several years due to this idiosyncrasy . Wendel owned much property in New York City , but would never rent , anything to the city , nor would he lease anything to a " gin mill , " I understand . At first no stenographer was assigned and Mr. Craven used Joe Banks , a rodman , son of General N. P. Banks of Civil War reputation , and a man of considerable culture , as his secretary . Letters were written in Joe 's neat longhand . Mr. Craven was an excellent draftsman and could put his ideas into as good and understandable graphical form as anyone I know . I often recall the picture of him , sitting in that office with a small two-by-two drafting board in his lap , on which were several crinkled blueprints , and on top of them a piece of tracing linen on which he was making a drawing . The blueprints were used for reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and look at it ; then put it back and go on with his drawing . When it was completed  | it was a neat , finished plan ? how it could be I never could understand . The first work on my division was begun on subdivision 5B by Naughton and Company , who had done much underground trolley construction . Their section extended from Forty-second Street to Sixtieth Street on Broadway . Having already had experience with politics on previous work I was naturally apprehensive about them as they were rated popularly as " Tammany " contractors , but a short experience soon dispelled any such feeling . They prosecuted the work with vigor and intelligence , and the quality was excellent . Any request by the engineer for improvement in quality was cheerfully carried out ? the only objection being to an order that would cause a slow-down in progress . Their chief engineer was George W. McNulty , formerly an assistant engineer on the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge , and his assistant was C. W. S. Wilson , later to become a member of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who established an excellent reputation for competency and quality . Naughton and Company first started work at the Sixtieth Street station ( Columbus Circle ) . Because of the advanced state of their work at that station it became the field for many experiments ? for example , enamel brick was tried for the side wall and ceiling finish . This was also used for the station at i loth Street and Lexington Avenue . Because of the cost of this enameled brickwork it was decided to use tiling for other stations . A notable feature of their section was the underpinning of Columbus monument ? a creditable accomplishment , particularly in view of the fact that comparatively little of such work had ever been  | done at that time . Their work was well done and they were the first contractor to complete their section . In those days the plans required the complete enveloping of a structure with fabric asphalt waterproofing . All of this asphalt work had been let to the Sicilian Asphalt Company . I remember how rigid the inspection of this work was , and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Much money was spent to repair the few leaks that were found . Examining the work after all these years I think a good job was done , and the inspection faithfully carried out . I have often . said that if concrete is seventy-five per cent to the good it will do its work , but ninety-nine per cent waterproofing will still cause a leak ? in other words , it has to be perfect to accomplish its purpose . Work on subdivision 5A was the last to be started because of the New York Central negotiations mentioned . It was sublet to Degnon and McLean , and extended from Fourth Avenue and Forty-first Street to Broadway and Forty-seventh Street . I did not know McLean , but Degnon was the active man and I learned to know and admire him . He came from Ohio and had done , and was to do , much important public work . At this time he had one or two similar contracts on division one . His chief engineer on 5A was Harry C. Sanford , who had been with McDonald at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an able and conscientious engineer of an aggressive temperament . Mr. Briggs was on a number of subway contracts . The work proved to be a very difficult task , partly due to the lack of experience in such work in a busy thoroughfare like Forty-second Street . The specifications did not require decking the streets , and much of the work was done in the open , causing inconvenience  | to the residents and property owners . For these reasons later contracts required decking of streets , which in turn necessitated the removal of gas supply under the decking and a temporary system laid in the gutters or on trestles . These features added much to the costs of both the contractor and the city , both directly and indirectly , because the work had to be done under cover instead of in the open , and the supports for the decking caused more or less interference with the operations . However , I feel sure that the decking is in the best interests of the public . Most of the excavation between Sixth and Seventh Avenues was done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not believe would be done again , experience having shown its disadvantage . An open cut was made for the southern one of the four tracks along Bryant Park and the site of the Public Library , then being built . A cableway was used for the construction . When the excavation was completed the steel for one track was erected in it . Then small drifts were excavated on the line of each bent , transversely with reference to the subway axis and steel eye beams were set in them , one end resting on the completed subway roof , the other on undisturbed ground far enough north to permit excavation to be made for the second track . This operation was repeated for the third and fourth tracks , thus completing the structure . Then the steel supporting beams and poling boards were withdrawn and the space over the subway roof filled in with hand-packed rock . Some of the temporary timber was left in place . This method did not disturb the roadway surface , except for the cut for the south track ; but its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | pletely fill the voids over the drifts , and in course of time the yellow pine timbers rotted and allowed the street to settle , not all at once but a section here and another later . Twelve or fifteen years later it was necessary to resurface the street and the tram car tracks several times at considerable expense . Whenever soft ground is disturbed by the passage of tunnel no matter with what care the voids are packed over the arch or roof , and especially when timber is left , there is bound to be a settlement unless it is thoroughly filled with grout . The use of the shield with proper grouting minimizes this trouble . Mr. Rice purchased a number of portable shanties for use as field offices for section engineers . They answered the purpose but were open to many objections , and in later work were not used . The one for subdivision 5A was located on the northwest corner of the wall enclosing the Old Croton Reservoir , and the contractor built his office near-by in Bryant Park . When the period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removal of these structures , causing great inconvenience to the engineers and contractors . The work on 5A was very comlilex . There was an express station at the Grand Central , and a local station on the sharp curve at Times Square where the line curved into Broadway . On the southwest corner of Forty-second Street the Belmont Hotel was being built where the subway comes into Forty-second Street , and the latter was designed to pass through the basement of the hotel . Likewise on the " island " at the northwest corner of Broadway the Times Building was under construction , and the steel was so framed as to  | permit the subway to pass through the basement stories . Subdivisions 6A and 6B , covering the work between Sixtieth and io4th Streets , were sublet to William Bradley , who had made a success of cellar digging . He was assisted by his brother James , experienced in building masonry . They were not used to supervision and restriction , and were testy about it . One morning I met William on the work and in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by residents along the line of his work . Resolutions had been passed censuring him for the untidy condition of the streets . Bradley met one of the leading men on the street that morning , and addressed him thus : " Say , have any of those men who passed that resolution any business to attend to ? " " Yes , " was the reply , " all are men of substance . " " Say , " said Bradley , " then who attends to their business while they are attending to mine ? " That was his size-up of the situation ! An appurtenance of the work was the laying of a forty-eight-inch water main from Forty-second Street and Seventh Avenue , south on Seventh to Fortieth Street , thence east on the latter to a connection with the existing main on Park Avenue ? all this to replace the existing main on Forty-second Street which interfered with the building of the subway . One morning in 1902 I was walking east on Fortieth Street , inspecting the progress on this main . I had passed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man with a red flag at Park Avenue facing north . I thought it strange because there was no open excavation in the vicinity . The subway work south of Forty-first Street was in tunnel with the head-  | ings far advanced from the shaft located near the west curb of Park Avenue just south of Forty-first Street . So I could not see why a signal was necessary . As these thoughts were passing through my mind a terrific explosion occurred . I heard stones and glass falling in the street . Instantly I jumped to the south side of the street fearing cornice stones of the hotel would fall on me . When I reached Park Avenue a crowd had gathered , and the man with the flag shouted to them to go back . They returned like a flock of sheep in panic . The neighborhood seemed to be a wreck . Practically every pane of glass in the Murray Hill Hotel , the Grand Central Station , and the Grand Union Hotel , was broken by the concussion . The magazine for the subway tunnel on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lying on the walk just inside the entrance of the Murray Hill Hotel were two cabmen who had been knocked down by the concussion . Their horses were also on the sidewalk , apparently not hurt . I started to go into the hotel , noting that the risers of the stairway to the foyer had been blown in so that I could see into the basement through them . One of the cabmen called me , advising me not to go in . I have always appreciated his thoughtfulness and regretted that in my excitement I failed to offer to help him , though I do not think he was seriously hurt . I saw the hotel manager , Mr. Jacques , standing near the desk apparently unconcerned , but really so shocked that he did not know what had happened . A woman guest , handsomely dressed , came into the lobby from the direction of the elevator , also looking unconcerned , but as blood was running down her face I assume that she had been cut by falling glass and was dazed . The  | entrance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magazine which had exploded . It felt the explosion most and I heard that seven persons had been killed there . Realizing that all telephones in the neighborhood would probably be out of order I hastened to the field office ( Swift 's ) on the old reservoir wall on Fortysecond Street west of Fifth Avenue and notified Mr. Craven by telephone of the explosion . He in turn notified the chief engineer , and I returned to the scene of the trouble . By this time a huge crowd had gathered and I had difficulty in passing the police lines . The magazine was located within the board enclosure for the contractor 's working plant at the shaft at the west side of the street , under the platform of the hoisting engine . Rubbish had been allowed to accumulate about the magazine and had caught fire . The hoist runner , whom I had known on previous work , heroically went down to put out the fire and was caught in the explosion and killed . It was a brave act on his part . He probably realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do what he thought was his duty . The Rapid Transit Subway Construction Company afterwards pensioned his widow ; I understand they arranged to pay her for the rest of her life the salary that her husband would have earned . This was probably the worst accident that had happened up to that time on the subway work . The contractor was Ira A. Shaler , formerly of the firm of Washburn , Shaler and Washburn at Titicus Dam . Mr. Shaler was a most particular man , and an engineer and contractor of considerable experience . His was the last work that one would expect to have had such a catastrophe . Mr. Rice was inspecting the tunnel with Shaler  | when a fall of rock occurred in the roof , striking Shaler in the back , injuring his spine . It resulted in his death a few days later , thus closing the life of this promising young man . The work was completed under the direction of his engineer , Charles E. Fraser , who later became a member of Fraser , Brace and Company , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which was done in Canada . Since those days inspection of magazines and precautions for safety have been improved and such accidents are rare . Detonators are stored a safe distance from the explosives , and both are stored in such a manner as the fire department approves . The powder is checked on delivery and the cartridges taken out are accounted for . Of course dynamite is not a thing to trifle with . Its handling is a necessary risk in all rock work , but I believe that the precautions now taken are as safe as it is practicable to make them . Someone contributed a thought in a communication to the daily papers some time ago which I like to recall . It was to the effect that nearly all the trouble in the world , except earthquakes and tornadoes , is caused by the inspector who does not inspect . And it should be remembered that the best of rules " gang aft agley " when the inspector does not do his work . Every experienced construction engineer prizes the good inspector and knows how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Bureau of Combustibles told me that in the previous year three and a quarter tons of explosives had been detonated in the city of New York daily . That was when subway construction was at its height . Certainly such an amount of explosive work requires watching !  | DIVISION ENGINEER OF THE EAST RIVER TUNNEL ONE afternoon in early March , 1903 , I was inspecting the work on Forty-second Street when a message was delivered to me from the chief engineer , Mr. Parsons , directing me to call at his office at once . Thinking that something had gone wrong , and that Mr. Craven could not be reached , I immediately repaired to 320 Broadway . Bracing myself for what might be coming , I happened to meet Mr. Parsons as he was going up in the elevator . I noticed that he did not look angry as he took me into his private office . He asked me abruptly if I would like to be division engineer in charge of the tunnel under the East River , the contract for which , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let to the Rapid Transit Subway Construction Company . I was much surprised at this unexpected offer of promotion , but retained presence of mind enough to answer that I would like to be if he would take a chance on me . He replied pleasantly that he would take that chance , and  | I went to Mr. Craven with my head more or less in a whirl . I presume my account of the interview was not perfectly clear to Mr. Craven , for when I was through he said , " But you accepted , did n't you ? " " Yes , " I replied , expressing my sincere regret that this promotion would sever my close association with him . I had worked with him for many years and my respect and admiration for him had grown steadily . I was to serve again under him , however , when he became chief engineer of the Public Service Commission . Contract two was the logical extension of the first subway , known as contract one . It was intended to carry the subway into Brooklyn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Office Building on Park Row south under Broadway to Battery Park , where a loop was designed to turn back Manhattan trains . The main line continued under the East River from South Ferry to the foot of Joralemon Street , Brooklyn , running under that and Fulton Street and Flatbush Avenue to a terminus at Atlantic Avenue , where the passenger station of the Long Island Railroad is located . Before contract two was let the Commission had diamond drill borings made across the East River on the line of tunnel to discover the position and character of the rock . Among the borings were a number which penetrated the rock to grade . This boring work was done conscientiously under the direction of James C. Meem , then an assistant engineer of the Commission . During the driving of the rock headings later I watched for the holes and found two of them . No air seemed to be escaping from them . In one of them the rock was hard and sound , in the other more or less decomposed as Mr. Meem 's notes had indicated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hole , which he prized very much . Bids for contract two were received by the Rapid Transit Railroad Commission in February , 1903 , I believe , and the contract was awarded to the lowest bidder , the Rapid Transit Subway Construction Company , at its bid of two million for the construction plus an additional million for terminals . This was approximately twenty per cent of the actual cost and the low bid was due to the desire of the company to get this operating franchise into Brooklyn , and to keep out its rival , the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company , which was the only other bidder . Their bid was eight million for construction and one million , I think , for terminals . The term of the lease was for thirty-five years with a privilege of renewing for fifteen years more . This was different from the franchise life of contract one , which was for fifty years , with renewal privilege for twentyfive years more . The contract was subdivided for construction purposes into four sections . Section i extended from 2A was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brooklyn . Section i was assigned to the first division and the contract work was " subbed " to Degnon-McLean ; sections 2 and 2A were sublet to the New York Tunnel Company , sponsored by Andrew Onderdonk ; section 3 was sublet to Cranford and McNamee , well known in Brooklyn , and builders of many of the public works . Sections 2 , 2A , and 3 were assigned to the new division of which I was to have charge . ( This was afterwards designated the fifth division. )  | I took charge on March 23 , 1903 , establishing division headquarters for the time being in one of Mr. Rice 's portable buildings that had been erected in Battery Park where William Stevenson , assistant engineer , was already established . Later we occupied one of the upper floors of the Jefferson Building , 4 Court Square , Brooklyn , which was nothing to brag of and I regretted my haste in selecting it . We could have found more dignified and convenient headquarters elsewhere , I believe , but it answered the purpose . My first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ division . I selected for senior assistant engineer , Frederick C. Noble , who was then in the designing force . He was a son of Alfred Noble , who was president of the American Society of Civil Engineers at that time and was considered the dean of civil engineers in this country . The son was a particularly able engineer and his reports and designs left little to be desired . I know but few engineers who could write as clear a report as he . William F. Stevenson was placed in charge of the Manhattan end of the tunnel and of the Battery Park loop , remaining as such practically until the completion of the work . He was a graduate of HarvardLawrence Scientific School . For Stevenson 's assistant I selected John B. Goodridge , who was transferred at his own request from the first division . His work was particularly on the Battery Park loop and he handled it with skill and energy . I had much confidence in him . For the Brooklyn headings of the river tunnel I selected James F. Sanborn , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Clarke . I had not known Sanborn before , but he came to see me at Mr. Craven 's office on the Saturday afternoon that  | I was appointed , and he applied for the transfer . I was instantly impressed with him . When I next saw Mr. Clarke I asked for Sanborn and after demurring for a time Clarke finally let him go . For the section engineer on section 3 I asked Mr. Craven to let me have Lazarus White , a graduate of Columbia University who was first assistant to Bayly Hipkins on section 6A of the second division . Mr. Craven also let me have Alex Thomson , Mr. Myers ' assistant on 6B whom I made White 's assistant on section 3 . A new man , Samuel F. Thomson , should be mentioned . He was assigned principally to the division office . He was a graduate of Massachusetts Institute of Technology , and had been with Colonel Waring of the Street Cleaning Department . He was a loyal assistant . At his own request he was later transferred to the Board of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first assistant of the division engineer on the Wallkill division . When that work was finished he resigned and for a time was employed by James Pilkington , the contractor . In January , 1907 , although a very young man he had a stroke of apoplexy which resulted fatally . The outstanding feature of the work on the division was the under-river tunnel known as section 2A . It was the first transit tunnel built under the East River . Its prototype was the Hudson and Manhattan Rapid Transit tunnel under the North River , which had been started in the late 187o 's , and after two attempts at its construction it had been brought to completion by the McAdoo interests under the engineering guidance of Jacobs and Davies Construction Company . The Battery  | tunnel was started just after the Pennsylvania Railroad tubes under the North and East Rivers were begun . The Battery tunnel consisted of two cast-iron circular tubes driven through the soft ground by the shield method under compressed air . The under-river portion extended from the South Ferry slip in Manhattan to the bulkhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Manhattan ends , for about one thousand feet of the tubes , were in rock excavation , but for most of the distance the rock cover was light . There was also a rock reef under the middle of the channel . The remainder was in earth , sand , and silt ? entirely different material from that negotiated in the Hudson River tunnels , through which the shields could be driven with the bulkhead closed , pushing the material out of the way . All of the East River material had to be taken into the shield , and removed from the tunnel through the shafts . The War Department required a depth of about forty feet at and between the pierheads , which fixed the approach grades at 3.2 per cent . These grades continued under the river to insure cover for the tubes , and were joined under mid-river by a long vertical curve . It was necessary , however , to provide clay blankets where the natural cover was not sufficient . The design of the iron lining was much lighter than is the present practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . There has been a great improvement in the design and manufacture of iron these days . For instance , the bolt holes in the Battery tunnel were slotted , not circular ? a great mistake , since the iron could not be held so well to its circular form ? and the bolts were not so heavy as at present . To save excavation the outside diameter of the iron was larger ,  | and there was a concrete lining called " baton " which merely filled up the spaces in the plates to the edge of the flanges , making it a most difficult job to place in the segments above the spring line . As this was the first East River tunnel much has been learned since that time ? the art of compressed shield tunneling has been brought to a high state of development through experience gained under the waters of New York harbor . The New York Tunnel Company had as its chief engineer , Walton I. Aims , a competent young man who had had compressed air experience in the Hudson and Manhattan tunnels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River . He was very bright and able ; but he was an individualist . There was trouble almost from the start , especially on the Brooklyn side . In the first place Aims was handicapped by the low bid of the contractor . Whoever had made the bid had grossly underestimated the cost . This was undoubtedly a constant worry when he naturally wanted to make a good showing . In the second place the contractor 's plant for the compressed air work was deficient in power , so that it was impossible to keep up a sufficient pressure at the shield , especially when going through the loose sand formation partly above and partly below water level under Joralemon Street . No attempt was made to breast the face , and not only did the air escape freely through the ground but numerous runs occurred , sometimes extending to the surface of the street . Because of the lack of air pressure there was special trouble in placing the bottom segments of the iron ring . There was so much water that it called for vigorous pumping , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the  | street and the segments of the iron to crack . It was impossible to hold the shield to grade , and it was impracticable to remove and replace the cracked segments behind the tail of the shield . Before I reported on the job Aims had received a permit to sink two construction shafts on either side of Joralemon Street , south of Henry Street , an oldfashioned , conservative , and wealthy residential district on Brooklyn Heights . By sinking the shafts there , and driving the dry headings to the east as far as the end of the section near Clinton Street , the contractor could do cheaper work and accumulate some money to help him on the under-water portion . Had it been known what this was to lead to , I do not believe permission would have been given , and the shafts would have been located near the river as was done in later projects . The dry headings progressed fairly well , but there was settlement and some runs of ground due to the fact that the faces were not breasted ? no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sinking of the shafts was a workmanlike job , but little consideration was shown for the residents . For instance , it was necessary about one o'clock one night to do some repair work on one of the shields , which required shaping and cutting of some heavy steel plates . Instead of taking this work to the river it was done in the street , making a terrific racket , and sleep was impossible . The residents were exasperated and there was no friendly feeling for anyone connected with the work . When the shafts were started toward the river there were long delays and much damage to the adjacent buildings . Shafts were finally sunk at the foot of the street over the tunnels , between Furman Street and the river . The temporary  | shaft near Henry Street was closed and the street surface restored , to the relief of the residents . While using the Henry Street shafts the contractor had leased a house on Garden Place as the " hog house . " When the sand hogs moved to the new shafts the residents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always welcome as residents in a high-grade neighborhood . The tunnel clothes and language had not appealed to the people there . But I do not know of any class of labor that works harder on the job than do sand hogs . They are ready for any emergency and do not run away from dangers inherent to the work . It is fine to work with them , even though their manners are not of the drawing-room type . After the river was reached and the shafts moved , there was not so much trouble , but plenty enough , and the job was always hampered by lack of plant . The contractor had leased a vacant lot controlled by the New York Dock Company , and erected on it his compressing plant . The compressors were working at high speed and the air pumped into the tunnel was so warm that the men worked stripped , except for overalls and shoes . Sometimes they would lie down in the water which leaked in to cool themselves . It is a wonder that there were not more cases of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and out of the air frequently on a wide open valve . I was in every day generally , and frequently on Sundays , but never suffered from the bends . Some of us took the precaution of coming out slowly as is required now . Caisson disease or the bends was not so well understood at that time . Clifford Holland later did much to establish and enforce the safety rules in this respect .  | It was our custom to have a line and grade party in the tunnel on each shift , to take the levels on the rings and to catch the tendency of the shields to go up or down . These results were immediately plotted and from them the contractor would be told how the shield should be pointed . The results on this job were very poor . The contractor claimed that the direction of the shields had been taken out of his hands , because our engineers had assumed it . This was only a subterfuge to get out of the responsibility , if possible . The fundamental trouble was the lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the face . Quite a stretch of the tubes on Joralemon Street were so much out of grade that it was necessary to reconstruct portions of them later so that the trains could operate through them . This reconstruction was done under an arrangement between the Rapid Transit Subway Construction Company and Fred L. Cranford . Mr. Cranford , with his engineering ingenuity , assisted by James Meem , did the work in places , taking out some of the broken iron segments and substituting reinforced concrete . On the Manhattan end of section 2A there were troubles enough , but things were not so bad as in Brooklyn . When I reported as division engineer the New York Tunnel Company had fenced in an area in Battery Park near South Ferry , enclosing their shaft site , working plant , and field office , and had begun the excavation of the shaft from which the river tunnel was to be started , and which was wide enough to take in its two tubes . The shaft was soon sunk to grade without special difficulty and the heading started toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open cut . Although the rock cover was evidently  | quite thin in places with possibilities of valleys dropping below the roof grade , the contractor 's chief engineer decided to go ahead without air . Under the South Ferry slip a pile was struck in such a valley , which being disturbed communicated with the river and flooded the heading ? with no loss of life , however . Blanketing the leak he pumped out the water , then installed his locks , and put the air on . After that he continued in the rock with timbered heading and eight or nine hundred feet out he drove a connection between the tubes to provide better communication , and to permit construction to go on in one without interfering with the excavation . After installing new locks beyond it , advance in the headings was resumed . At that time the rock cover was getting pretty thin and indifferent in quality only a few feet above the roof grade , and it was necessary to timber constantly . This was done with good twelve-by-twelve yellow pine sets . Fortunately on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the consistency of concrete . At twelve o'clock Saturday night work would stop for Sunday , leaving only pump men and caretakers on the job . Although the tubes were lighted by electricity , candles were used for various purposes . One Saturday night , when the gang quit , one of the men must have left a candle burning on a yellow pine timber in the north tube . Early the next morning ( Sunday ) when the pump men attempted to pass through the north lock the tube was full of acrid smoke . The candle had evidently set fire to the timber . In the open air this probably never would have happened , but with air under twenty-five pounds pressure everything burns easily and readily . Hearing of the occurrence I went down but could  | not get in the tunnel because of the smoke . The tubes were practically inaccessible . In an endeavor to ventilate them as far in as the cross cut , the contractor had built a partition in the shaft between the two tunnels , carrying the north compartment in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface of the ground . This was an ingenious idea which caused the draft to go into the south tube to the cross cut , through the latter and out the north tube to the shaft , thus removing enough smoke and fumes to enable the men to enter the tunnel as far as the locks beyond the cross cut . The air locks are set in massive bulkheads , and in this case the bulkhead was five feet thick and built of excellent brickwork designed to hold the air . I was surprised to find on the outside of it a coating of pitch like tar which had been carried by the fumes through the pores of this five-foot bulkhead , and condensed or precipitated on the outside face . There were two or three boxes of dynamite just inside the lock , and the heat made it advisable to remove them , because it was feared that an explosion would wreck the bulkhead and allow the air to escape and flood the tubes back to the shaft . " Wingy " Hawkins , a one-armed foreman , went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free air , although several of the sand hogs who had gone through the locks had had to return on account of the smoke . Hawkins knew this was a great hazard because the decompression would evidently cool the dynamite and might cause it to explode . This is an example of what these men do when an emergency comes . They take such chances as a part of the day 's work without hesitation , without expectation of reward , and sometimes receive little  | credit . We do not hear of such men organizing a lobby and going to Congress for hand-outs or pensions . The contractor lowered the air pressure , permitting some water to enter the tunnel to aid in extinguishing the fire . The water would seep through the rock into the south tube and was quite warm from the fire . It was not until Thursday that the tube in front of the lock could be inspected . Then a rowboat was passed through the " material " lock of the burned tube . By that time the water had risen to the floor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I made the trip that day with the foreman . With a 3.2 per cent descending grade the water deepened , of course , as we went on , and when we got near where the fire had been the boat was about at the roof grade and our heads were rubbing against it . About ninety feet of the roof timbering was burned , allowing the rock which it was supporting to fall and also some of the hard pan above it . Investigation of the profile showed only ten or eleven feet of unsupported hard pan between the roof and the river ? a ticklish situation . If the hard pan had not been what it was , the river would have broken in and the situation would have been very serious . The first job , of course , was to get rid of the water . When this was done the contractor started work vigorously and built timber supports on top of the debris in order to secure the roof . It seemed quite hazardous for the men to climb ten or twelve feet among those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . Again the sand hogs went at the job without fear or hesitation and made the roof secure . The fallen debris was then removed and the cast-iron lining was extended through the disturbed ground , and the voids above it were back filled and grouted without incident .  | It was a very interesting experience to have gone through . Work on section 3 in Brooklyn was delayed in starting because the river tunnel was the much longer job , but it was prosecuted vigorously afterward and the cooperation between the engineers and contractor was excellent . Percy Litchfield was the resident engineer for the general contractor on section 3 ? a man of positive and active temperament . He afterwards became a contractor and had a contract for a section of the Seventh Avenue subway , known as section 2A on contract three , in Manhattan . On the Joralemon Street portion of section 3 the stretch from Court Street to the end of the section near Clinton Street was in tunnel , and James Meem devised a novel method of excavation by using a sectional shield of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other work . Each section of the shield consisted of three six-by-twelve timbers , perhaps fifteen feet long , strongly bolted together with steel straps or plates , a half-inch-by-twelve inches , bent around the forward ends , which were shaped to form a cutting edge , and extending along the top of the timbers for their full length , and for some feet beyond to act as a " tail . " Each section of three timbers was jacked forward as a unit , the noses being kept in the undisturbed sand face to prevent a run of ground as the excavation was made . Temporary braces were used to support the forward ends of the sections and permanent timbering followed behind , being placed under the protection of the tail . Each section was advanced about five feet before the heavy timber sets were placed . The logging  | for the latter was two-inch stuff . To reduce excavation the heavy timber sets were kept inside the net outside line of concrete , and of course had to be removed when the latter was placed . The only timber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-inch logging . Excavation could be made of any width by adding additional sections of the shield . Of course the utmost care was necessary to make this method successful and it usually was in progress during the eight hour shift when Mr. Meem could be present . That the settlement of the street and adjacent buildings was reduced to a minimum reflected great credit on him and his contractor . His success with this work was in contrast to , the trouble experienced on the adjacent river approach tunnel of the New York Tunnel Company . There was a continuous line of elevated railroad columns to be underpinned on Fulton Street and Flatbush Avenue , and Meem designed an original way of holding them up by timber " A " frames and tie rods which worked very satisfactorily ; but many improvements have been made since those days , and cheaper and more positive methods are now employed . It may be of interest to mention one detail of sections 2 and 3 . The interior or " bulb angle " columns had been troublesome to paint on the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interior spaces be filled with concrete to protect and save them . This the contractor did and I am convinced that it was a good thing , but whether it was a paying proposition I do not know . Perhaps it did not improve the looks of the columns , but I think it was a good expedient . It was not , however , followed up on the later work . When the excavation was made on Fulton Street I  | noticed that the bottom would be so sandy , dry , and porous that no waterproofing of the floor would be necessary . The designs required completely enveloping the structure with asphalt fabric waterproofing . My thought was , why not omit the floor waterproofing and substitute for the roof a layer of brick in mastic , in lieu of the fabric waterproofing shown on the plans , and leave off the three-inch protective course of concrete . This was submitted to the subcontractor and Mr. Cranford agreed . I think it was a fair bargain . It saved the additional cost of the floor waterproofing and putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three-inch course of concrete on the roof . Against this was an additional cost for the layer of brick in mastic , a better waterproofing . The work had progressed a year or so on section 3 when agitation was begun for making the portion of Fulton Street and Flatbush Avenue a four-track structure . After a great amount of discussion this plan proposed by the general contractor was approved by the Commission . Much of the work having already been done , the alterations were quite difficult , and some doubt was expressed as to whether it had been wise to make the change . But the decision has been fully justified by developments . If it had not been done then , it would have had to be done in some form later , and it would then have cost more to open the street again . The two tracks of the Fulton Street subway were in the middle of the street and the change to a four-track structure required the excavation of separate trenches on each side . On Flatbush Avenue a lower level was built under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the upper level , provision being made in the plans for this complicated structure  | for turn-outs for future extensions to various streets : Fulton Street , Lafayette Avenue , and Fourth Avenue , none of which was afterwards used . In fact , from time to time portions of the lower level were cut into for other subway structures , and when the Schermerhorn Street-Lafayette Avenue line of the Independent System was built it was carried right through this lower level , cutting it in two . This is an illustration of planning too far ahead for a public utility , particularly in a growing city . So many things can happen that it is not wise to do so . When the time came to make the extensions that had been so carefully provided for they were made a part of another system . As a matter of fact , had the original plan been carried out it would have choked the Interborough System . This track could not have taken care of the trains on all the branches . I went with the Board of Water Supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lazarus White remained in charge of section 3 as section engineer until the early part of 1906 , when he obtained a transfer to the Board of Water Supply , and was assigned to me at my request . I had made no mistake in selecting him and am thankful that I had the good sense to do so . The Battery Park loop was a complicated piece of construction to lay out because most of it was on curves . The structure was built of reinforced concrete , quite an innovation from the steel bent , with concrete jack arch design , used almost universally on contract one . Plain square rods were used for the reinforcement , as advocated by St. John Clarke . It is not considered good practice today to use them ; deformed or twisted rods are preferred . Reinforced concrete structure had been  | tried experimentally on a section of the Lenox Avenue subway . The design for section 3 in Brooklyn also called for reinforced concrete , and the contractor , Mr. Cranford , seemed to prefer this type to the steel bent at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion . In later work where the plans showed reinforced concrete the design was frequently changed to steel bents at the request of the contractor , with no additional cost because in his opinion the work was easier to execute by that method . The steel frames lent themselves to a more convenient support of the street and the sides of the cut because loads could be transferred to them as soon as the steel bents were erected and riveted , whereas there was a delay when it was necessary to wait for reinforced concrete to harden . Practically all the subways since 1912 have been based on steel frame design and there was no evidence that the contractor wanted anything else . The work at the Battery was below tide level and the amount of tidewater which would flow into the cut at high tide , opposite the old barge office , was quite a source of trouble . It was estimated at three thousand gallons per minute , maximum , and the contractors and engineers deserve great credit for shutting it off so thoroughly . Overlying the rock at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erosion better than any " soft ground " I have ever encountered . Although the water came in at the South Ferry station , flowing for several months over the platform excavation and dropping four feet or so vertically to the track level , it eroded a channel not more than two inches or so in depth in that time .  | That was thirty-three years ago and every time I enter the South Ferry station I look for a leak , and am gratified not to find it . We had good inspectors on the work who were faithful and had good common sense . I was glad to have had the experience on the river tunnels . Although the work was not prosecuted in a way to get the best results it illustrated how not to do many things and the experience was very valuable . After I had transferred to the Board of Water Supply the tunnel headings had been holed through in the reef under the river , meeting very accurately . About that time the contractor 's work was reorganized . Major D. L. Hough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in construction were due principally to the original contractor 's lack of capital , and lack of cooperation of his engineers ? not lack of ability . The quality of the work , concrete and incidental , was good and it is regrettable that the compressed excavation and iron lining gave the job such a black eye . The trains have been running through the East River tunnel since 1907 , and there has been no trouble with its maintenance since that time , outside of the usual tunnel repairs necessary to such a structure . The leakage has been slight . The records for the Interborough Company 's pumping from the mid-river pump which I tabulated for many years showed a practically constant amount , about one and a half gallons per minute when I last saw it . This was the leakage of about two miles of single tube draining to the sump . The first section of contract one ? the portion from the south end of Brooklyn Bridge to 145th Street and Broadway ? was opened for operation on October 4 , 1904 , with appropriate ceremonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While it was a pioneer job with many new construction problems to work out it is surprising that its record for speed of accomplishment has not been equaled since . The contract was awarded in February , 1900 . Four years and eight months later the trains were running . In the elapsed time the job had to be organized and financed , subcontracts let , construction in the streets of a big city carried on , track laid , stations finished , intricate equipment of all kinds installed , a new type of car manufactured , followed by a period for the organization and training of the operating force . The city obtained the work at much less cost than any of the tubes constructed since , and as far as the cost is concerned it got an unusually good bargain . It was a marvelous accomplishment . On the completion of the first step of subway construction , Mr. Parsons resigned as chief engineer , effective January 1 , 1905 , and George S. Rice , the deputy , was appointed to succeed him . At the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was promoted I took the liberty of speaking to Mr. Rice of the qualifications of John H. Myers of the second division for division engineer in Mr. Craven 's place , and recommended him highly . Myers was the logical candidate , and he was appointed and served with credit to himself and to his friends for long years until he retired in 1934.  | DEPARTMENT ENGINEER OF THE BOARD OF WATER SUPPLY IN the summer of 1905 I received a message from J. Waldo Smith , chief engineer of the new Board of Water Supply of New York City . When I called at his office at 299 Broadway I was offered the position of division engineer on the new work at a salary of five thousand dollars , which was one thousand more than I was then receiving . It was intimated that I would be given the position of department engineer at a further increase in salary when the permanent organization was effected . This new board had been created in June of 1905 to provide an additional water supply for the city . I had found compressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see completion of that work and I hesitated to accept this tempting offer . But after deliberation which took into account the fact that there would shortly be a lull in rapid transit work , and that the new enterprise was of magnificent size and possibilities , I finally accepted . The Board of Water Supply appointed by Mayor McClellan was free from  | politics , and the chief engineer was relatively a young man ( but little older than myself ) with a fine reputation of accomplishment behind him . ( Mr. Smith had offered me the division engineership in charge of the Jerome Park Reservoir when he was chief engineer of the Aqueduct Commission , but I had felt obliged to decline it . ) I resigned my position with the Rapid Transit Railroad Commission on August 31 , 1905 , and the following day reported at the office of the Board of Water Supply , and remained with that board until January 14 , 1912 . I regretted leaving the unfinished work of the fifth division ( particularly the river tunnels whose headings had not yet met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineers and contractors . But I knew that the work would be in good hands because I felt sure that Fred Noble would be appointed in my place and that was done in due time . My resignation not only opened the way for his advancement , but also led to the promotion of others . The water supply of a growing city may be likened to the cottage or cabin a young farmer builds when he starts housekeeping . It is small at first but as his family grows and his needs increase he builds an addition , then another and another , until the house becomes a large one . So with the water supply . The original one is built at a time when the city is small , and usually over much opposition from those who oppose obviously needed improvements . The general public usually assumes that the original supply is sufficient to last for all time . As the city grows the supply falls short and can not be increased from time to time . It is hard to make the community realize the urgency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work on an added supply until a water famine is threatened . When the need becomes apparent and is pointed out by those who are informed in such matters , there are some who insist that politics is back of the demand , or some remedy for temporary relief is proposed . This experience is repeated each time and I suppose it will always be so . Fortunately , there are in every community , far-seeing , intelligent men , who have an unselfish interest in civic affairs , and who see to it that attention is given to such matters . This has been the history of New York from early days , as a study of the records will show . Between the time I joined the Aqueduct Commission in 1900 and my entry into service with the Board of Water Supply in 1905 the Croton River sources had been developed to practicable limits , and the city 's needs were nearing that capacity . In 1900 the Commissioner of Water Supply had retained John R. Freeman , well-known consulting engineer , to investigate the situation . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a classic . This led to the organization of the board known as the Commission of Additional Water Supply , composed of Professor William R. Burr , Rudolph Hering , and John R. Freeman , eminent consulting engineers . That commission investigated the situation , examined the available sources for an additional supply , worked up the details of a reservoir and conduits from sources east of the Hudson River , and also pointed out the availability of the Catskill region . The report published in 1903 was a valuable document , but it is worth noting that it had scarcely appeared when the legislature in its wisdom passed a law forbidding the city to develop the sources in Dutchess  | County ? thus undoing all the good work of the commission . As a commentary on this , after the Catskill work was well started a man , prominently identified with the Democratic party management in Dutchess County , came to my office in Poughkeepsie and expressed surprise that the city was going way up to the Catskills for water , when the Dutchess County streams were nearer . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be saved . He was surprised when I told him that was just what the city had wanted to do , but was forbidden by the legislature . While talk about more water was before the public a private concern advanced arguments for going to the Ramapo region which they controlled . The Comptroller received credit for opposing that scheme , as he should have . Exposure killed it , of course . The amount of water that could have been obtained from there was limited , and the idea of depending on a private supply was distasteful to the people . The matter came to a head when the new Board of Water Supply was appointed in June , 1905 . One of their first acts was the appointment of J. Waldo Smith as their chief engineer which did them much credit . In my opinion no one else could have carried that great work to completion as ably and creditably as he did . The beginning of the work of the Board of Water Supply caused a rush of young engineers as had been the case when the subway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project to be carried out in the wonderful country where the reservoirs would be located , and which the aqueduct would traverse , was an inducement to ambitious young men who were not afraid of work . Young graduates from technical schools applied , as did many of the best men on the rapid  | transit work and in other city departments . Mr. Rice called me to account for robbing his organization ; but I can truthfully say that , while I was glad to get these good men , I did not urge anyone to make a change , having no desire to cripple the other work . However , many of them did come , including Sanborn , Sproul , White , S. F. Thomson , Alex Thomson ? from the rapid transit work ? and Lawrence C. Brink , John P. Hogan , and many others from various places . W. E. Swift , who had left the subway work in 1903 to accept a position with the Bureau of Reclamation , and had recently returned from work on the Panama Canal , was likewise appointed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the headquarters of the board , the chief engineer , and of the parties working out from temporary bases in the country . The jurisdiction assigned to me was later called the Northern Aqueduct Department , extending from , but not including , the Ashokan Reservoir ? the main reservoir in the Esopus watershed ? to Hunters Brook five miles or more southeast of Peekskill , and included the Hudson River crossing . In this jurisdiction I gave Sanborn the survey work west of the river ; Sproul , the east of the river ; and Swift , the river crossing and its approaches . This was a fine staff of workers whose ability , enthusiasm , and loyalty could not be improved upon . The work of these parties , and of those of the other departments progressed so satisfactorily and enthusiastically that on October 9 of that same year ( 1905 ) Mr. Smith had the information for a report to the Board recommending that water be obtained from the streams of the Catskills with an aqueduct of a capacity of at least five hundred million gallons daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tentatively cross the Hudson in the vicinity of New Hamburgh . The estimated cost for the first step of the project was one hundred sixty-two million dollars , I believe . This report was excellent , and notwithstanding the haste with which it was prepared it was carried out in substantially all its essential features . Under the law it was necessary for the State Water Supply Commission to approve the general plan before any work could proceed ? the purpose being the conservation of the water of the state , and the reservation of certain watersheds for particular communities . Immediately after the chief engineer 's report arrangements were made for these hearings to be held in Kingston . A large wall map , showing the proposed property , aqueduct , and reservoir lines , was prepared for this purpose as well as for other necessary data , and the hearings proceeded . There were the Commissioners , chief engineer , consulting engineers ( W. H. Burr , J. R. Freeman , F. P. Stearns ) , and the principal members of the staff , as well as Corporation Counsel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of course those opposed to the project . The headquarters during these weeks were in the old Eagle Hotel which is still in existence . The principal opposition came from the Ulster and Delaware Railroad , then an independent railroad extending from Kingston to Oneonta across the middle of the proposed Ashokan Reservoir site ? which railroad is now a part of the New York Central system . The company was represented by Judge A. T. Clearwater , whose reputation at the bar was high . The chief engineer was the principal witness for the city and had to bear the brunt of cross-examination . His grasp of  | the subject , his ability to think clearly under crossexamination , and his coolness and fairness , impressed all who heard him , and gave one an insight into the working of his mind and great admiration for his character . After thorough and protracted hearings , aimed to bring out all the pertinent facts , the State Commissioner approved the city 's plan , thus permitting the Board to proceed with its studies . It was extremely fortunate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George B. McClellan throughout his entire six years of office . It was through his influence that the act creating the Board of Water Supply was passed , and his consistent backing of the Board and its chief engineer was of great help . Four sources of supply were included in the plan submitted to the State Water Supply Commission , all in the Catskills : Esopus , Schoharie , Rondout , and Catskill Creeks . The combined watersheds would furnish safely more water than the planned aqueduct would carry , but the conduit was as large as it was thought advisable to build . As constructed it can carry about six hundred million gallons per day . To this time ( 1937 ) only the Esopus and Schoharie have been developed , and they have been sufficient to supply the aqueduct . The Rondout will be developed with the Delaware project . Catskill Creek will be reserved for the present . The first development of the project , after its approval , was roughly as follows : On the Esopus Creek near Olive Bridge would be built the Olive Bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hundred twenty-seven billion gallons of water , divided into two basins . The dam structure ,  | about two hundred fifty feet high , created a reservoir of two basins , the west basin being on the main stream below the dam . At first it was thought to take the water out of the reservoirs from the extreme east end of the east basin , and locate the aqueduct along a natural ridge to a proposed crossing of the Hudson near New Hamburgh . Later a more detailed study indicated the advisability of establishing a dividing weir between the east and west basins , and locating the control or outtake of the water there . This in turn caused an investigation of the river crossing with the result that ? after careful study and consideration of the reservoir conditions and the limestone at New Hamburgh and certain disadvantages of that tentative location ? on my recommendation the decision was made to locate between Storm King and Breakneck Mountains at the upper gateway of the Highlands . Such a change in the crossing necessitated a relocation of fifty miles or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that time had been located only on paper . An application was made in 1906 to the State Water Supply Commission for a revision of the line and was approved with little opposition following a hearing at Newburgh . The Peekskill division , except the pipe siphon at Indian Brook , Sprout Creek , and Peekskill Creek , was placed under contract in 1go7 ? the first construction contracts to be let , known as contract two . ( Contract one was for the borings in the Hudson River at Storm King . The other boring contracts were less formal and were known as agreements . ) We were fortunate in having a good executive engineer like Sproul to supervise this pioneer contract two .  | Indian Brook is one of the minor tributaries of the Hudson River ? a beautiful spot and one I always like to visit . It was on the slope of that small valley that the formal ceremonies of breaking ground for the Catskill Aqueduct took place in 1907 . It was a beautiful fall day and I can distinctly recall the occasion . J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mayor McClellan , and others , made suitable addresses and the whole affair passed off very pleasantly . The party was brought up from New York on one of the river steamers , landed at Cold Spring , and transported to the site by horse-drawn buses and automobiles . Near the site of the ceremonies was a Scotch widow 's farmhouse . As the Northern Aqueduct traversed a region of scenic beauty , it was always a pleasure to go over it . Mrs. Ridgway often accompanied me on those trips , adding much to my pleasure . We would sometimes take lunch with us , or pick it up somewhere along the line . This farmhouse was one of our favorite lunch places . The elderly widow and her middle-aged daughter , Maggie , would kindly leave their work in the field and cook us some eggs . Mrs. Ridgway and I had moved to Poughkeepsie in the spring of 1 gob , residing first in a small cottage at 48 South Hamilton Street ? far from the ideal place we would have liked . Some years later we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church and South Clinton Streets which Mrs. Ridgway liked very much . But we were obliged to move the following spring because the house was sold . We then occupied a comparatively new cottage farther south on South Clinton Street , which we rented until we moved back to New York . After the second year the office was established in the new building of the Poughkeepsie Trust Corn-  | pany where it remained until I left the work in January , 1912 . The engineering work of the Northern Aqueduct Department was very diversified in character . It was approximately sixty miles in length . At least two-thirds of this length was cut-and-cover , and the rest , pressure or grade tunnel ? pressure tunnel , that is , below the hydraulic gradient , or grade tunnel at the hydraulic gradient . The construction cost was approximately thirty million dollars . Before the work began there was a feeling that the cost relation , between the tunnel and the cut-and-cover , was more in favor of the latter than was afterwards shown by actual results . In the light of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do over again , I would recommend a larger per cent of tunnel ? perhaps a long tunnel from Tongore siphon in a practically straight line to shaft one of the Wallkill siphon , cutting out all the intermediate cut-and-cover , and at other points including the elimination in favor of tunnel of the cut-and-cover on the steep sidehill back of Cold Spring . Hindsight in this case , as always , is better than foresight . The deep pressure siphon tunnels under the Rondout , Wallkill , Moodna , and Hudson valleys were the outstanding engineering features of the work in this Department . As far as I know the pressure tunnel construction was never used before , at least on such a scale . The New Croton Aqueduct , built about 18go , included a pressure tunnel under the Harlem River valley and the streets of Manhattan Island , as far south as 135th Street gatehouse , but the maximum unbalanced pressure head was perhaps one hundred twenty-five feet , whereas at the Hudson River crossing of the Catskill  | Aqueduct it was approximately four hundred feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other siphons . I was an advocate of these pressure tunnels , but it took much nerve on the part of the chief engineer to decide in favor of them ? a far greater responsibility than the design of the great dams at Ashokan and Kensico . There were a number of these steel pipe siphons on the line of the aqueduct . In the Northern Aqueduct Department there were seven ? the largest traversing Peekskill Creek valley . They were designed for three pipes with finished inside diameter of nine feet but , for economy , only the center of the three was placed in the first installation , and the other two were added after I left the work . The chief engineer had had considerable experience in steel pipe construction which stood him in good stead . Lock-joint pipes , nine feet two inches ( I believe ) , were first laid on concrete saddles for the full length of the siphon : the lock joint which was longitudinal and the cross joint , joining two successive lengths of pipe , were riveted . The pipes were " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then they were whitewashed to protect them from corrosion while in transit or while being stored . After the full length of pipe was laid and riveted it was filled with water under full hydrostatic head . While in this condition the internal pressure brought the pipe to a circular cross section ? when empty the crown would settle slightly . Then the outside casing of concrete was placed , after which the pipe was unwatered . The outside concrete held it to true form and prevented it from sagging . Then the one-inch interior lining of cement mortar or grout was put in  | behind forms , the grout being introduced through holes in the crown of the pipe , two to each joint ? one for pouring , the other for the release of air . The mortar lining insured a smooth surface and increased the hydraulic properties of the pipe . The building of the concrete aqueduct was started on several sections in each division . Of course during the cold winters concrete work had to be suspended . On a large work there is always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and such a mistake would be very serious . Knowing that , I assigned Assistant Engineer Zipser , a man with an excellent mind , to run a line of levels starting from the Reservoir Department and running through to some definite construction point in the Southern Aqueduct Department to see whether their interpretation of grades was the same as others . He was to discard the regular bench marks except to touch on them as he went through for references . He would assume , for instance , that the invert of a piece of aqueduct and the Reservoir Department was correct , and see as he went along that every stretch of invert was consistent with it . In case of grade tunnels where no concrete had been placed he would touch on some grade point and figure independently whether it agreed with his levels . This may seem like a needless precaution , and some engineers regard it so with intelligent and competent men at work . But it is where they are least expected that errors occur , with dire results . I have often been forcibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's work right , when some " brilliant " assistant , in order to save a little trouble , made a foolish mistake that led to much trouble . These pressure tunnels were so designed as to have  | an ample covering of sound rock and the profile was so fixed as to leave a low place where the pump shaft was located . This pump shaft was designed and constructed with a great deal of care , offset from the center line of the tunnel at seventy-five feet , and connected with it by a cross passage in which was located a bronze valve half-egg-shaped section opening against the pressure . The shaft was designed with an outer and inner concrete lining between which hollow tile was built in to permit drainage when the shaft was empty . The inner lining was built with four reinforced concrete guides on the inside surface ? two of them to guide the large float which was to carry one or two centrifugal pumps , the other two for cage guides , the cage intended to serve the pump gauge and the float . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pump sank with it , and riser discharge pipes were added at the surface . There was a sixteen-inch cast-iron leadlined pipe imbedded in the masonry and connected with the tunnel , so that the latter could be emptied by gravity to the elevation of the top of the shaft . These pumps were tried on several occasions and succeeded in unwatering the tunnels . Experience with them , however , would undoubtedly lead to a more practical design if more were to be built . It is to be remembered that these were pioneer tunnels , and I think that Thomas Wiggin , the chief designing engineer , deserves much commendation for doing so well in designing them . I have spoken of the depth at which they were located in the rock , and some criticism was made because the contractor thought they were unnecessarily deep . I think Mr. Wiggin was right , and in the case of City Aqueduct No. 1 , which runs for a part of the way under Sixth Avenue ( between Fifty-ninth and  | Fifty-third Streets ) , it would have been better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I doubt , however , that Mr. Wiggin was responsible for that . A rapid transit subway is now ( 1936 ) being built under it , and it will require the removal of the cover of the tunnel to a depth of sixty feet in places . The rock is none too sound for a part of the way , and it would have caused less anxiety if the aqueduct tunnel were deeper . A detail of the pressure tunnel was the junction between the vertical shaft and the horizontal tunnel . Mr. Wiggin wanted to make it theoretically correct , and the form contract by the Gillespie Company , who had the first contract on Rondout siphon , cost , I am told , twelve hundred dollars . The vertical shaft and the tunnel were both circular in cross section , but the cross section on the forty-five degree line was somewhat elliptical . The form was made in four quadrants and on account of its expense was used several times . It was loaned or sold to the Degnon Company for the Wallkill siphon . When concreting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove the form from the tunnel and hoist it up the four hundred foot shaft . The section engineer , D. W. Howes , was in the tunnel , when this was being done , with the superintendent , Frank Lee , a southerner with a rather droll sense of humor . Several Italian workmen were also there . The form was loosened from the concrete , attached to the derrick falls and the signal given to hoist it up the shaft . The section engineer said that he could hear it swinging against the concrete lining as it went up ; then as it neared the top he heard a shout and felt compression  | of the air . He said to Lee , " That form is coming back , we had better run . " " Oh no , it is simply swinging round to land on the surface , " said Lee . The compression of air continued , and Howes started to run in the tunnel away from the shaft , followed by Lee and the workmen . They had gone about seventy-five feet when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the tunnel , ripping up some of the construction track , and injuring one or two workmen . Howes shouted , " Did you see it land ? " Lee answered , " No , I was n't like that Sodom and Gomorrah woman , I did n't look back . " Which showed that he had knowledge of the Scriptures . Careful borings were taken before the profile of these tunnels was fixed , and eminent geologists , including the late W. W. Crosby of Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Professor J. F. Kemp of Columbia University , and C. P. Berkey of Columbia , were employed to interpret the borings and advise ? a very wise precaution . Parenthetically , the chief engineer was very long-sighted and wise about such things . He believed in seeking good advice , regardless of expense , and the events proved his wisdom . However , with all the care in getting the boring data and its interpretation , one could never tell what weakness there might be in the rock structure between the borings . A weaker man than J. Waldo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ siphon tunnels in favor of steel pipe lines , as a surer method though not so permanent . In his specifications for contract he wisely included provision for testing these tunnels by a hydraulic test after construction was completed . Such a test at Rondout siphon developed a leakage of about  | eleven hundred gallons per minute , indicating some sort of a break and it was advisable to make repairs . After the completion of this tunnel the hydrostatic test required by the specifications was made by filling the tunnel , the downtake and uptake shafts at the ends lined with concrete providing an accurate means of measuring the leakage . This test was made shortly after I left the job , and a pool was started among the engineers to see who could guess nearest the amount . I have forgotten what my guess was ? perhaps seven hundred gallons per minute ? at any rate I drew third , for the actual leakage was in the neighborhood of eleven hundred gallons . This was too much to leave , in the opinion of the chief engineer , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the plant provided for such contingencies , and an examination made . When the tunnel was pumped out it was found that some ruptures had occurred in the lining where the tunnel was in Helderberg limestone , due probably to cavities existing outside the prism of the tunnel , which could not be seen when the tunnel was driven . Mr. Smith decided that the lining should be repaired for about one thousand feet by placing in it curved channels ( flanges inward ) welded together , this forming practically a steel lining . The space between the channels and original lining was grouted and a light lining of concrete placed inside , hiding the flanges , thus forming a Venturi meter . When this was done a second test was made showing practically no leakage . One of the bad features of a tunnel through limestone is the presence of such cavities . The rock through which the tunnel is bored may look perfectly sound , yet within a few feet there may be a cavity weakening the rock . In pressure tunnels like those of the Catskill  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater than the original exterior pressure , it is quite important to secure sound rock for the integrity of the work depends on it . The test of the Moodna-Hudson River siphon on the west side of the Hudson River showed leakage which ran down on the West Shore tracks . The tunnel there was in a very hard and dry granite where we would not expect any weakness . The enormous pressure had lifted the rock overlying the tunnel to an extent to open cracks in the concrete lining and permit the loss of water . This seemed strange when one considered the conservatism of the chief designing engineer , Thomas Wiggin , who , in fixing the profile , insisted that there be weight enough of rock between planes extending upward from the sides of the tunnel to supply a weight at least equal to the hydrostatic pressure , regardless of any weight of earth that might be over that . I used to argue with him against this conservatism , but have since been convinced that he was right . When the above-mentioned trouble occurred the chief engineer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven hundred feet beyond the disturbed section , sink a vertical shaft an additional three hundred feet and join it to the shaft at the river 's edge , which as stated before was over eleven hundred feet deep . This additional work was done by Oscar Daniels , contractor , in jig time and the re-test proved satisfactory . While driving the tunnel under the Hudson River , which nearly all the way was in sound tight dry rock , it was found that at the depth the rock was in tension and the phenomenon of " popping rock " was evidenced .  | Immediately after a shot the roof and sides would be scaled to sound rock , but a day or two later there would be reports like pistol shots and scales of the rock would come off , so that re-scaling was necessary . Sometimes there would be an unexpected fall of ground that was disconcerting , as , for example , when a survey party was taping the tunnel a rock fell from the roof on the tape between the two chainmen . I understood from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such deep tunnels . By the route adopted , the Northern Aqueduct , on leaving the dividing weir of the dam , crossed the Esopus Creek valley by means of a steel pipe siphon and followed down the contour of the creek in a relatively short stretch of cut-and-cover , with another short pipe siphon under Tongore Creek . There were then some miles of cut-and-cover along the side hill on the right bank of Esopus Creek to the entrance of the Peak grade tunnel , through the hill of that name . The tunnel was a half mile long , debouching on the hill overlooking Rondout , a four and a half mile valley . There was another stretch of cut-and-cover to the downtake shaft of the pressure tunnel siphon below hydraulic gradient under the Rondout valley at High Falls . This siphon reached a depth of seven hundred feet below hydraulic gradient at its base on the slope of the Shawangunk Mountains . I regarded it as the most difficult piece of construction work in the department . There were eight shafts ranging from four hundred to seven hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rock , including the hard Shawangunk grit , and the very porous Binnewater sandstone . One of the shafts ( num-  | ber four ) was a very wet one ? the flow into it reaching the maximum of about three thousand gallons per minute . Twice the shaft was flooded and recovered at great expense and difficulty by the contractor . We were fortunate not only in the engineer , but in the contractor for this tunnel ? T. A. Gillespie Company , a concern of large financial strength and spirit to undertake difficult tasks . Mr. Gillespie had the reputation of amply equipping his work with the latest type of machinery , his compressor plant on the siphon is said to have cost two hundred fifty thousand dollars , probably the largest plant for its price installed up to that time . It was a steam-driven plant , then regarded as more reliable than electricity which had only just begun to come into its own . Notwithstanding the difficulties mentioned this contract was successfully completed with little ado , and for this the contractor deserved much credit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superintendent of the work , a real man whose cooperation with the engineers for securing best results attracted men to him and gained their high respect . I often recall an incident that occurred on this contract . I received a message one night that the heading at shaft four had encountered a cave in the Helderberg limestone filled with clay and other soft material , and that the contractor was obliged to stop for the time being . Going over in the morning I met Mr. White , division engineer , and R. J. Gillespie , and with hand acetylene lamps we went into the heading . As the wire had been broken by the slide the tunnel was left in darkness except for the hand lamps . Walking along we were stopped by the slide of clay which had flowed into the tunnel from the cave . The slide had left such a high  | roof that we could not see it with the light we had . It was an awesome sight . After the debris was cleared out , the cavities were thoroughly filled with concrete as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very large mass being used . Then when the filling was completed everything was carefully grouted . Another incident of this contract , illustrating Gillespie 's action in emergencies , occurred one cold day when the explosives , being thawed , exploded near the head of shaft four , wrecking the head frame so that the hoisting plant was out of business . Fortunately the headings with shaft five had been holed through so that accessibility was obtained in that way . The contractor had recently constructed a heavy bulkhead just north of the shaft , designed to resist the pressure in case the pumps could not handle the heavy flow of water that was expected from the Binnewater sandstone . A heavy timber door was provided in it , opening against pressure . When the head frame was wrecked this door was closed , making the tunnel safe . Word of the accident was telephoned to T. A. Gillespie in the morning . Before night he had a representative of the General Electric works at Schenectady with authority to order any items of machinery necessary to repair the damage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resumed . Ordinarily it would have taken two weeks to do this . From Rondout siphon the aqueduct passed through a mile grade tunnel under Bontecou Crag of the Shawangunk Mountains , the downstream portal being on the Wallkill slope of the mountain . Then it followed along the contour of that slope in cut-and-cover , and a short stretch of grade tunnel through a spur of the mountain , known as the Mohonk tunnel , about six hundred feet  | long . From this stretch of the aqueduct are inspiring views of the Wallkill valley . A feature of this cut-andcover was the Freer cut ? a deep and difficult excavation through a gap of the main ridge and an outlying spur . The west side of this cut was very heavy on account of the geological attitude of the Hudson River shale rock ? incline nearly forty-five degrees ? and when a vertical cut was made through it the rock would slide over these beds so that the excavation was , through no fault of the contractor , excessively large . The lower portion of the stretch was built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Construction Company , who had the contract for the middle of the Bonticou tunnel south to , and including , the Wallkill pressure tunnel siphon . Mr. Pilkington had an interesting record , enlisting in an Ohio regiment during the Civil War while in his teens . He saw service in that war , and following it , after some experience in the midwest , he joined the New York police force and was attached to their famous " Broadway Squad " ? all sixfooters . He subsequently took up contracting about New York and earned an enviable reputation for straight work . This aqueduct job was a losing venture for him , and each month saw him more " in the red , " but he did not complain , carrying out and completing his work faithfully . In quality I doubt whether any portion of the work was executed any better . At shaft one of the Wallkill pressure tunnel the aqueduct dropped into the Hudson River shale rock , and continued under the valley on a slightly descending grade to shaft three ? the so-called " pump shaft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the uptake shaft near Ireland Corners . Then came a long structure through relatively  | smooth country , known as the Orange cut-and-cover , because it principally traversed Orange County . There was only one break in the grade where it had to pass under the Central New England Railroad . A peculiarity of this cut-and-cover was the fact that it was generally on the " top of the country , " that is , for most of the way no culverts were required under the aqueduct , because the latter was on a summit and the drainage was away from both sides of it . This continued to the vicinity of a little hamlet known as Washington Square where a depression below the hydraulic gradient was traversed by one of the steel pipe siphons . Then it continued in cut-and-cover to the downtake shaft of the pressure tunnel under Moodna Creek valley . Moodna siphon , over four miles long , was an approach to the crossing of the Hudson River , as Moodna valley like those of the Wallkill and Rondout was far below the hydraulic gradient , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those other cases ) by a deep rock pressure tunnel . So the downtake shaft was deep , and it continued in the solid rock , mostly shale , except at the lower end where it was Hudson River granite . From the foot of the shaft the tunnel passed along slightly descending grades to the river shaft , then there was a vertical drop to the tunnel under the Hudson River . The top of the tunnel at this shaft was eleven hundred feet below the surface of the river ( mean sea level ) , and it passed under the river in granite rock , about three thousand feet in length , dropping about three feet in this length to the bottom of the uptake shaft on the east bank , making that point of the aqueduct the lowest on the line . Then it rose a little over eleven hundred feet to the surface and eventually a  | cast steel cap was placed over it , and the shaft was maintained as a pump shaft . When the upper part of the aqueduct was completed , water was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hudson River , where one of the forty-eight-inch gates was left open so that the water could waste through it into the river . ( This was some time after I left the work but Mr. Wheeler told me of the incident . ) For some reason the attendant at the east shaft closed the forty-eight-inch gate , checking the flow in the conduit , which had a water-ram effect . The shock passed back through the Hudson River at Moodna siphon about four and a half miles to the downtake shaft . The chamber over the shaft was covered with removable reinforced concrete slabs , weighing about fifteen hundred pounds each . None of the engineers was at the shaft but a native in the woods near-by noted that within a few minutes of the closing of the gates these covers went up in the air to the treetops . Then the shock traveled back to the gatehouse at the downstream end of the pipe siphon , near the village of Washington Square , and broke the windows of the gatehouse . This was surprising to the uninitiated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result . When the chief engineer was informed of it , his philosophical remark was , " Well , they had to learn what water will do " ? an illustration of his attitude of mind . About two hundred fifty feet below the river surface in this shaft the aqueduct continued landward under Breakneck Mountain , then rose vertically to the surface at a point at the hydraulic gradient . Then it pierced Breakneck Mountain at grade in tunnel . The access to  | the heading of this shaft during construction was by means of an incline railroad operated by a cable . It was always an interesting experience to go up and down on this railway ? the view at the top was inspiring and if the car did not jump the track it was always safely done . The downstream end of Breakneck tunnel terminated in a portal from which the aqueduct was carried across Breakneck valley by cut-and-cover to the portal of Bull Hill grade tunnel . A glance at the alignment would impress a critic with the idea that this line could be considerably shortened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but what was done avoided a long stretch of soft ground . Bull Hill tunnel , piercing the mountain of that name , was about a mile long , through good granite rock . The original contractor , Paterson Brothers of Pittsburgh , failed to complete the work , and the sureties had to complete it with McKibben ( afterwards on the subway and other work with Underpinning and Foundation Company ) as superintendent . George Perrine was the engineer for the sureties ; he was formerly in the design department of the Rapid Transit Railroad Commission , and later with a number of subway contractors . Perrine was a very able engineer ? diffident , never attracting attention , but always keeping his employer posted . I have a high respect for him . Only those who knew him realized his ability . Among his talents was the ability to make sketches of all sorts of things , including many humorous ones ? which surprised those who thought there was no humor in him . From Bull Hill tunnel the aqueduct passed under the Foundry Brook valley in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a stretch of cut-and-cover through rough sidehill country crossing a small depres-  | sion at Ferris Brook ( I believe ) at grade where a special construction was used for the foundation to a short granite tunnel known as Mekeel tunnel . This tunnel , which was very dry , and the adjacent cut-and-cover , were constructed by R. K. Everett and Company under a subcontract for the receivers of McNally of Pittsburgh ( the original contractors of the work from Foundry Brook siphon south to the end of the Peekskill division ) . Unfortunately for everybody McNally won the contract at an absurdly low price , and it was a troublesome job from start to finish . McNally sought the support of a certain politician in New York , thinking it would help him , but when he got into trouble he was apparently left in the lurch . He was a likable man , tall , with a firm chin , and of manly appearance and manner . He eventually went into the hands of a receiver , after trying manfully to keep up , but the sureties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lumber dealer of New York City , and ex-Governor Benjamin B. Odell . My experience with Paine was not an agreeable one . Trouble developed between him and Odell , who was very able and an experienced businessman , and Odell became the sole receiver , completing the job eventually . I saw a great deal of Mr. Odell , and my acquaintance with him developed an admiration for his great ability . Evidently McNally had had difficulty in subletting this part of the work . It was most difficult to construct , most inaccessible , and McNally 's prices had been too low . The Everett Company encountered one difficulty after another , losing money although they did their work well , and the culmination was an unfortunate explosion in the Mekeel tunnel resulting in the death  | of ten men . The suits went against the contractor , as they usually do , and Mr. Everett , losing heart , killed himself . It was unfortunate that the firm ever undertook the job . Associated with Mr. Everett was his brother-in-law , Richard Baldwin Jr. , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with me in the Jerome Park Reservoir days . From the Mekeel tunnel the aqueduct continued in cut-and-cover to Indian Brook , back of Garrison , which was crossed by a steel siphon pipe ; then in cut-and-cover to the portal of Garrison tunnel , passing through a deep cut through a minor divide . The Garrison tunnel was a little over two miles long , passing under some of the ridges of the Highlands . It received its name , for want of a better one , because it was back of the city of Garrison . It had an intermediate shaft about one hundred feet deep in a depression in the profile , and was quite inaccessible . This was also part of the unfortunate McNally contract , and an attempt to construct was made by three subcontractors , two of whom failed . It was completed under direction of A. A. Johnson , a Yorkshire Englishman , who came on with the Pearsons when they were constructing the East River division of the Pennsylvania Railroad tunnels . Johnson had all the obstinacy of his race , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability and I admired the way he did his work . I have in mind particularly the soft ground which required close and careful timbering . This was done very well . Afterwards Johnson developed into one of the leading New York contractors , and carried out a number of subway contracts . He became president of the General Contractors Association of New York , and has much influence with  | other contractors and people generally . He has made a success of his work and is now ( 1936 ) in high repute and working in broad fields . South of the Garrison tunnel is a short stretch of cutand-cover to the beginning of the Sprout Brook steel pipe siphon ? three thousand feet . In this stretch was an artist whose name , I think , was Shaffer ; he used to do much work for the trade . On inspection trips I used to visit his studio in an old barn and watch him work . He would take a piece of crayon whose color was concealed by dust and smear it on the paper . Apparently the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process , and he would work it up as sunset on the Hudson or some such thing . He had hundreds of such scenes . I never knew what became of him . Near the aqueduct line was the road which used to be the Post Road to Albany in colonial days . On it were old milestones but at this time the road was badly kept and in a wild country . Sprout Brook was one of the gems of the country along the line . It was always a pleasure to go there . This relatively deep fertile valley with high hills north and south made a picture that can not be erased from my mind . Its charm was increased by its historic associations ? for there in Revolutionary days the small Continental Army was encamped , and the group of houses was called Continentalville . Since then patriotic associations have erected a tablet at the junction of the valley and the Post Road . At the south end of the Sprout Brook siphon the aqueduct passes into Cathill grade tunnel about three thousand feet long ? hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vicissitudes , largely due to its inaccessibility , under the direction of Mike Quinn , whom I had met on the Gillespie contract at  | Rondout Creek valley . Mike was a very likable chap whom I learned to know better in later years . He came to me one day and said that he had heard that a certain inspector with whom he had had trouble , had been ill , and had been assigned to his work . He hoped this was not so because he feared that he would lose his temper sometime and unfortunate results might happen . My own experience with this inspector had shown that he was a difficult man to get along with , no matter how honest or efficient he might be . I thought it best not to assign him to Quinn , which I assumed was the right thing to do . Many troubles came from inspectors who have peculiarities of temperament , and while I would hesitate to change an inspector because of a contractor 's complaint , there is no necessity of inviting trouble by assigning a cross-grained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contractor or superintendent . From the end of Cathill tunnel a stretch of cut-andcover carried the aqueduct to the beginning of Peekskill valley pipe siphon about one and a quarter miles long . The cut-and-cover carried it through the country about five miles southeast of Peekskill to Hunters Brook where my work ended , and the Southern Aqueduct began . The Southern Aqueduct was originally under the charge of Merritt H. Smith . On his promotion to deputy chief engineer it was given to Frank E. Winsor , who completed it . As it was outside my jurisdiction I was consequently not so familiar with it in detail . But it followed down Westchester County , principally as a cut-and-cover proposition , but with a number of grade tunnels , deep pressure rock tunnels ( notably the one under Croton Lake ) , and other siphons , to the valley  | of the Bronx River near Valhalla , where a storage reservoir of thirty billion gallons capacity was built , submerging by one hundred ten feet the old and small Bronx River Reservoir , which was built by the Department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reservoir was brought to the borough of the Bronx by means of a forty-eight-inch cast-iron pipe line . ) The flow line of the new reservoir was elevation three hundred fifty-five , and the water was impounded by a concrete gravity dam across the valley , at least three hundred feet high , the face of which was later embellished by massive cut stone facings designed by the firm of York and Sawyer , Architects . This was a wise provision of the chief engineer who realized that the dam site would virtually be a part of the city 's park system in a few years . When building dams he did not consider them merely as barriers across valleys , but as structures to be merged into the landscape by garden plantings and embellished by dignified architecture . Leaving Kensico Reservoir the conduit passed the site of a possible filtration plant at Scarsdale to a distributing reservoir at Hill View in Yonkers , just above the New York city line in the vicinity of the Empire City race track . At this point the so-called City Aqueduct tunnel began . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Bronx , Manhattan , and Brooklyn , at depths from approximately two hundred twenty to seven hundred fifty feet , as dictated by geological reasons . It was circular in cross section with varying diameters , and was about twenty miles long . At the time it was built it was believed to be the longest tunnel in the world . It divided or bifurcated in Brooklyn , and extended thence to two terminal shafts , one at Fort Greene Park , the other at Schermerhorn and Flat-  | bush Avenues , where provisions were made to connect with street mains . Beyond these shafts the rock surface dropped permanently to unnegotiable depths . From the Schermerhorn Street shaft a steel main seven feet in diameter was extended south to the Narrows , under which a very heavy cast-iron pipe of special design , with special ball and spigot joints , was successfully laid connecting with the Silver Lake terminal reservoir , at an elevation where connection could be made with the street mains of Staten Island . This was a great distance to bring a city 's water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of the necessity for care and faithfulness in its execution . In this brief description no attempt has been made to give details of the features of design , many of which were of a most intricate nature , or to point out how faithlessness on the part of a number of subordinates might wreck such a project if there were not proper supervision . There were a great many visitors to the work , some of distinction , but I shall mention only a few of them . I met many fine and interesting characters through these visits because the ride over the work in an automobile afforded an opportunity of furthering acquaintance . One day I was down in the tunnel at the foot of shaft four of Rondout siphon when Dr. Dave Flynn , representing the sanitary consultant , Dr. Lederle , came down and told me that Miss Anne Morgan and a friend , Miss Frances Keller , a social worker , were on top , and he would like to have me meet them . I went up with Superintendent R. J. Gillespie and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should see the tunnel ; so they put on oilskins and boots and went down , seemingly quite interested . With me that morning was an Associated Press man from Poughkeepsie to see the work . He had been a little timid about going down the deep shaft into the tunnel , not being used to it . When he came up to meet the ladies he suggested that he take pictures of them with their oilskins on . I was too innocent to sense the fact that he was a newspaper man after news . After seeing the workings the ladies went on their way , and Howard and I returned to Poughkeepsie . Late that Saturday night he telephoned me for details of the work and announced that he had sent the story of Miss Morgan 's inspection to the city editor of the New York World . I protested against this , thinking it was not the proper thing to do , but he said it was too late to withdraw it . So on Monday morning there was a story in the World telling not only what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Morgan 's talking with the Italian workmen , and telling the engineers to treat them kindly . The story was accompanied by photographs of the party , giving a " close up " of Miss Morgan . I sat down and wrote an apology to Dr. Flynn , explaining that I was not behind the story , and asking him to present my apologies to the ladies , which he did . On another occasion Commissioner Chadwick came up with John D. Rockefeller , Jr. , and a brother-in-law , I believe . I met them at the south end of the work . We stopped at the Palatine Hotel in Newburgh for the night . I purchased newspapers for the party and distributed them at the table . Mr. Rockefeller came late and I handed him one . He asked if there was any par-  | titular news . I said , " No . " He replied , " I do n't care to see it , I seldom read the papers . " The remark struck me as interesting , for what is the use of criticizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Governor Odell once told me that when a paper attacked him he gave instant notice to stop its delivery at the executive mansion . He told a friend this , and the friend replied , " If you keep that up you will soon be limited to the Ladies Home Journal and the Youth 's Corn/banion . " On the second day with Mr. Rockefeller we proceeded over the line of Ashokan Dam , and after seeing that returned south stopping at Poughkeepsie . I had been somewhat prejudiced against Mr. Rockefeller up to that time , having read the New York Sun ridiculing him principally on account of his Sunday school activities . But I found him to be a very sensible man of character , and very democratic in his manner . This good impression has continued since I have seen evidence of his charitable work in so many parts of the world . Another time Mr. Chadwick came up with President Charles W. Eliot of Harvard , and Dean Sabin of its Graduate School of Engineering . This trip also took us over the line of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . We stopped overnight at the Palatine , and knowing that they would be interested I called up such Harvard men as Bill Hanavan and others . They sat around Dr. Eliot in the parlor of the hotel and spent a pleasant evening talking with him . Hanavan , I remember , was most enthusiastic and has often recalled that evening . Going over the work we would stop at the various shafts and get out . Dr. Eliot would meet the superintendent and mechanics , including Benny Ryan , chief  | machinist of the Degnon Company . They would talk together man to man ? no condescension on the part of Dr. Eliot , and no obsequiousness on the part of the others . Each learned from the other and I believe both benefited from the contact . During those two days Dr. Eliot asked many questions . I never heard him ask a foolish one , nor did he ask the same question twice . I had always been an admirer of Dr. Eliot , but those two days gave me a deeper insight into his character and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an honor he would have done this country had he been Ambassador to the Court of St. James .  | ASSOCIATES ON THE BOARD OF WATER SUPPLY IN THE Fair . of 1911 the construction of the Northern Aqueduct was approaching completion . I invited some of my engineering friends , including Arthur Tuttle , J. H. Myers , and F. C. Noble , to come up from New York to inspect the work with me . It was very pleasant to have them do this . While they were on this trip Noble told me that he had been asked by Alfred Craven , chief engineer of the Public Service Commission for the First District , to tell me that he would be glad to have me consider the proposition of serving with him as engineer of subway construction ? equivalent to the position of deputy chief engineer . This disturbed me as I hated to leave the aqueduct work with J. Waldo Smith , and I thought it over a long time before deciding . However , in view of the slackening of the Board of Water Supply work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my understudy , Ralph N. Wheeler , would be promoted to my place if I left ? a recognition certainly due him ? and the fact  | that the subway work was to develop into one of the largest construction enterprises of the city , and that the new position brought with it increased standing and salary , I accepted Mr. Craven 's flattering offer to become his deputy ( with the consent of J. W. S. ) . My associates of the Board of Water Supply gave me a farewell roughneck dinner at Healy 's restaurant ( Sixty-sixth Street and Columbus Avenue ) ? an affair that has lived in the annals ever since . The dinner was never finished because practically all the tables were wrecked before it was over . I often wondered what my new Commissioner ( guest of the occasion ) thought of it , because it was pretty rough . I was flattered and proud of the Aqueduct boys , and often recall that wonderful affair as I grow older . I have never ceased to be thankful for the opportunity of being a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The six and a half years that I spent on it were very fruitful and happy ones . The romantic nature of the work and the magnificence of its operation appealed to me strongly . My association with J. Waldo Smith , for whom I developed a great admiration and affection , was inspiring . I , too , felt the same joy that he so well expressed in a letter to me , when he wrote : " It is a great source of joy to me that our paths have run near together so we might converse by the way while the busy world that we live in rolls by . " The greatness of mind and the other wonderful qualities of this man were not fully appreciated by those who were not closely associated with him during that period . To him more than to anyone else , or any combination of men , is due the inception and successful completion of this enterprise that brought the blessing of Catskill water to the people  | of New York . It was by far the most magnificent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time . Quiet , far-seeing , forceful , modest , generous , a wonderful executive ? well-trained by technical education and filled with a Yankee shrewdness ? J. Waldo Smith possessed those elements that attracted men to him . He liked manliness and had no use for weaklings ; he never pampered his men . While holding his subordinates to their responsibilities he would excuse an honest mistake ; they always knew he would stand behind them in their troubles . He easily assumed the responsibilities of his executive position and never shunned his duty , no matter how unpleasant or unpopular it might be . On at least two occasions the Board was under attack , and it underwent a severe and hostile investigation with some of the influential newspapers and civic associations lending aid to the enemy . He was largely the center of the attack and his acts were scrutinized in such a close and disagreeable manner as would have broken down the nervous strength of an ordinary man . It must have been a very trying experience but he never complained . When it was over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings toward his adversaries . In fact one of his closest friendships followed an investigation in 1go7 ? of the letting of the contract for the Ashokan Dam to other than the lowest bidder ? by Commissioner of Accounts John Purroy Mitchel , who afterwards served as mayor of New York . This friendship continued until the death of the latter in military service during the World War . Some years later there was another investigation which had to do with the letting of the contract for the pressure tunnel under the Hudson River at Storm  | King . The project of the Hudson River crossing was in a critical state because of unavoidable delay , as well as natural conditions , and the letting of the contract had been retarded . Consequently it was important that the contractor be well qualified by experience and means for such a job , so that he could prosecute the work vigorously , and not hold up the project . When the bids were opened it was found that Winston , the contractor for the Ashokan Dam and other jobs , was the lowest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contractor for the Rondout pressure tunnel , was second . Winston was already tied up to some extent with contracts at the dam , the completion of which was essential . The contractor 's attention should not be distracted by another job of magnitude . On the other hand Gillespie was free , and he had the plant , means , and organization to tackle the job properly . So in spite of his unpleasant experience of 1907 the chief engineer without hesitation recommended the award of the contract to Gillespie , and it was given to him . The contractor undertook the work at once and soon had it going at full blast . But the critics got busy just as promptly ( aided it was assumed by the disappointed bidder ) and caused an investigation by the District Attorney of New York County , who was not only thorough but quite nasty in tone and tried persistently to prove all sorts of wrongful relations including dishonesty between the chief engineer and the Gillespie interests . But exhaustive investigation by experts of all kinds failed to show anything that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were exonerated but , as in nearly all such cases , the investigators were not frank enough to admit that he was right .  | But the result proved him right ? that he had done the wiser thing . The Hudson River tunnel eleven hundred feet below the river surface was finished promptly and well . It was not delayed because all the contingencies which might have arisen were foreseen and provided for . Undoubtedly such experiences took a toll of the chief engineer , who carried the burden himself , and did not unload it on others nor complain . I often wonder how much his life was shortened by the strain . One would never have known by anything he said . An evidence of J. Waldo Smith 's wisdom was the inclusion in his construction contracts of a provision that the city would furnish the cement used in the concrete ? that is , the contractor must bid on the price per barrel for all cement used . The contractor , therefore , would purchase cement as customary , and the city would pay for the actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contractor to skimp on the cement , and also gave the engineer privilege to change the mix at any time . Without this provision I question whether the concrete would have been of such good quality . As Mr. Smith was an excellent executive he placed responsibility on his department engineers , and gave them as much authority as they could carry . He did not bother about details of the work , but kept his finger on its pulse . Each one had as much latitude as could be given him under civil service regime in selecting subordinates . No one of us could say , even if we were so inclined , that we were hampered by lack of authority , or that associates that we did not want were foisted upon us . The result was a wonderful morale and esprit de corps in the force . An incident that occurred at one of the hearings  | shows the feeling that the chief engineer 's men had for him . Mr. Smith was being questioned very closely on some point , and thinking he might want some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed a smile on the faces of some of the State Commissioners , and when the hearing had adjourned the chairman said to me : " I noticed that when your chief was attacked you fellows stood right behind him . " There was a healthy rivalry between units , but as little jealousy as I have ever seen in any human organization . In fact , the chief engineer would not tolerate it . I remember his saying , " If the green-eyed monster ever appears throw him out . " He had a pleasant habit of calling a conference of the department engineers in his New York office about once a month . It was always a pleasure to attend . After the business meeting , where we were given a chance to unburden our minds on all things relating to the work , we would go to dinner together and enjoy a social time with no discussion of work . He encouraged social affairs among the force . The outings held in the country inspired friendships , and while pretty rough at times in a manly way always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seasons the whole force was invited to attend , as guests of the chief engineer , a dinner and dance at the old Terrace or Palm Garden at Fifty-ninth Street , at which the Commissioners and other distinguished guests were present . Songs were improvised by the " poets " of the force and sung with gusto . These affairs were not quiet by any means , but these fine young men could take care of themselves under any circumstances . While of course not perfect I do not believe that any  | human organization could have been more ideal , and my memories of the years I spent as part of it are happy ones . The friends I made on the work , associates , engineers , and contractors alike , were valued ones . Sometimes I find myself wishing that I could repeat the experience , but always conclude that this is a selfish thought ? that any human being should be satisfied with one such experience in his life . On June 25 , 1936 , I attended the ceremony of the unveiling of a tablet to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is a granite slab inserted in one of the walls of the triangulation tower on Winchell Hill , and the inscription was composed by Thaddeus Merriman . Mr. Smith had died a few years before and was buried in the cemetery at his old home in Lincoln , Massachusetts . About two hundred of his friends were present at the ceremony , and appropriate speeches were made by George McAneny , John F. Galvin ( who died the following month ) , and George Gillespie , president of the Board of Water Supply . Some of the old Board of Water Supply songs were sung ending with one which went thus : " Good-night , J. Waldo , chief engineer , We 've had a time that was long held dear , And as we labor , toil will seem light , As we recall our good time tonight . " The ceremonies were touching and impressive among the pine trees , and those present will long remember them . It seemed as though Waldo 's spirit was with us . One of the next of my associates on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Merritt H. Smith ,  | originally engineer in charge of the Southern Aqueduct Department ; but on the retirement of Charles L. Harrison he was appointed deputy chief , and continued as such until Mayor Mitchel 's administration when he was made chief engineer of the Department of Water Supply , Gas , and Electricity . ( Away back he was engineer of the old Department of Public Works which ran along with the Aqueduct Commission , the latter constructing the Croton Works , and the former operating them and the distribution division in the city . I knew him slightly in those days and when he was in the Finance Department . ) Merritt Smith was a leader and a man of great presence , six feet four , well built , sinewy , and sporting a Van-dyke beard . He was soldierly in attitude ? a good disciplinarian ? and had a voice that commanded attention when he spoke . He had served in the old Seventh Regiment when he was young , afterwards in Squadron A of the New York National Guard , and later he commanded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The tragic death of his son in the Plattsburg camp in 1917 , when preparing to go into the service , affected him deeply and probably helped to bring on the illness which came in France , forcing him to return home . He was a jolly companion at any gathering when he led in song , and an excellent story-teller . He rode a horse well , could play a bugle , and , in fact , could do just about everything . He and the chief engineer complemented each other and they made an effective team . The contrast between them physically was marked ? J. W. S. very short , Merritt , tall . It was amusing to hear them sing together , Merritt 's voice booming out in good time , and J. W. S. squeaking , nearly always out of tune . One of their favorite songs was , " And the  | Smoke Goes Up the Chimney Just the Same . " Merritt died after an illness of two or three months in 1926 , regretted by a host of warm friends . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and was loved so much . There is a tablet erected to his memory by his friends , located in one of the pavilions at the foot of Kensico Dam . It is maintained by the American Society of Civil Engineers . I met Alfred Flinn about the time he was connected with the Aqueduct Commission under J. Waldo Smith . On the organization of the Board of Water Supply he became department engineer in charge of the headquarters department . When Merritt Smith vacated the office of deputy chief engineer , Mr. Flinn was appointed his successor and remained as such until he became director of The Engineering Foundation and secretary of the United Engineering Society . He has retained the first office ( 1936 ) but resigned the secretaryship , possibly on account of his health . Flinn is exceedingly conscientious and a great student , eminently suited for the position he holds , and he has contributed much to his profession . Always respected , his nature was constructive . I never knew him to speak vindictively of anyone ? a sign of a great nature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stages of the work , had been associated with Alfred Noble on the construction of the Pennsylvania Railroad improvement in New York City , and before that with Silas H. Woodard , supervising the construction of the Cheesman Dam in Colorado ? a part of Denver 's water supply system . He was from Missouri and naturally fond of horses which he entered in many races ? one named " Alfred Noble " ( after his associate for whom he and many others had high respect ) , an-  | other named " Waldo , " which won the Saratoga handicap and a gold cup . After his retirement he died of a heart attack . The heart condition was presumed to have been caused by exposure to compressed air in the Pennsylvania tunnel work . As an evidence of his gameness the doctor attending him after one of his attacks tried to reassure him , but Harrison bet that the next attack would kill him , which it did . Had he lived longer and continued in his position he would have made a mark on the work . Thaddeus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor of English at Lehigh , and the original author of the Merriman Handbook . I met " Thad " on our first trip to the site of the Catskill water works in August , 1go5 , and have kept in touch with him ever since . He was made a department engineer , assisting the chief in many of the engineering problems ? a job that befitted him as he was well versed in the technical part of the profession . He was promoted to deputy chief engineer and remained as such until J. Waldo Smith retired as chief , when he took his place . The Catskill Water System was virtually completed when Mr. Smith retired and Merriman took up the study of the possibility of a new supply from the Delaware River sources . The propriety of taking water from the Delaware led to the opposition of New Jersey and Pennsylvania . Suits were entered in the United States courts to enjoin New York from diverting any of the water , as the Delaware is an interstate stream . Merriman prepared the engineering side of the case for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city in the hearing held before the Master appointed by the Supreme Court of the United States . Largely on  | account of Merriman 's good work and presentation the Master decided that the city could take the water to a maximum amount , and his report was confirmed by the court . This reflected great credit on Merriman , who worked hard , conscientiously , and intelligently on the case . He is now ( 1936 ) active as a consulting engineer on Fort Peck Dam in Montana , and other important works . Ralph N. Wheeler was appointed department engineer to act as my understudy on the Northern Aqueduct . He was a graduate of Massachusetts Institute of Technology , in the class with Thomas Wiggin and William E. Swift and others who distinguished themselves . He came from Concord , New Hampshire . In his early days he had been an assistant engineer in the Water Department of Brooklyn , I believe , and later was assistant engineer of the Rapid Transit Railroad Commission in charge of a section of work on the first division of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T. A. Gillespie Company , contractors . He was quite a " find . " Absolutely reliable , with an intelligent and earnest grasp of the work , he made an ideal assistant ? nothing could have exceeded his loyalty . He took hold of the work thoroughly , as though it were his own , and I did not realize what a nervous strain he was under until he broke down about 1910 , and had to go away for a number of months to pull himself together . I was mighty glad to have him back for his help was invaluable to me . He was fond of outdoor life ? hunting and such ? and chafed under confinement . Wheeler was much respected by his associates and his opinions carried weight . He was wonderful at drafting specifications ; a paragraph which he had drafted had but one meaning ? those who have written specifications know  | what this means . When I left the work to go with Mr. Craven , Wheeler was appointed my successor , much to my pleasure and satisfaction . He was later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Electricity , in charge of the upper Catskill works , remaining there until he retired to live in a home he purchased in Florida . I hope he will have a long and comfortable life in his retirement for he certainly deserves it . I can not express too highly my regard for him ; he was not a self-seeker or advertiser , but a thoroughly reliable and wonderful friend . Archibald A. Sproul was a Virginian ? of an old family in the valley section near Staunton . He was a graduate of Washington and Lee University . He came north and took a position with the engineering department of the borough of the Bronx , and was transferred from the Rapid Transit Commission at the beginning of the work on the aqueduct . Sproul was an excellent engineer and a man of courage and judgment . During subway days he had occasion to order the discharge of one of the contractor 's foremen , and Jim Bradley , losing his temper , blamed Sproul and struck him . Bradley weighed about twice as much as Sproul , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interference of an inspector prevented a fight . I came along the street a few minutes after this episode , not knowing anything about it , and Sproul told it to me calmly without excitement . This was the mark of a courageous man , as most men would have retold the story several times , and shown perturbation . At another time a drunken employee of a contractor attempted to strike Sproul , and I am afraid there would not have been much left of him with Sproul behind the blow , but someone interfered . Sproul was in no way quarrelsome , but he insisted on  | good work , playing no favorites . When construction began he was given charge of the Peekskill division , including the McNally contract , and carried it on remarkably well . It is pretty hard for an engineer to supervise a losing contract because , of course , he must insist on proper quality of work even if it means more loss to the contractor . When the receivers took hold , Sproul was appointed their engineer to supervise the contract , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a. reorganization , when he resigned , intending to retire to his farm in Virginia . But he was shortly taken with pneumonia and died . He left many friends , all of whom had high respect for his integrity and his likable personality . Sproul was very fond of camping , and during the preliminary stages of the work would take a small party and camp out to observe Polaris . He was an inveterate smoker of long cigars . I asked him once how many he smoked a day , and he replied : " It depends on how early I get up . " I have been blessed during my career with association with many loyal and able men among whom Sproul was in the front rank . I wish he could have lived longer to enjoy the simple things of this world of which he was so fond . William E. Swift , in charge of the Hudson River division , was a native of Connecticut , descending from colonial stock . One of his ancestors was an officer in the Continental Army under Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Institute of Technology , and a classmate of Ralph Wheeler . He served with the Rapid Transit Railroad Commission as section engineer on the second division , under Mr. Craven . Mr. Craven had a high opinion of him and once told me that he had openly expressed the opinion  | that he considered that Swift was capable of filling any engineering position from chief down . One always felt safe in leaving anything in his charge . After leaving the Transit Commission about 1903 he went with the Bureau of Reclamation when it was being formed , and he was in charge of the Truckee-Carson project in Nevada . From there he went to the Panama Canal work under Mr. Wallace , then chief engineer , and for a time was employed on topographical work before real construction began . An attack of Chagres fever incapacitated him and he returned to the States . The fever recurred from time to time for many years . Swift had a great deal of nerve ; I do not believe that he ever knew what physical fear was . I remember crossing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so thick , at Storm King where the current was swift and the depth was eighty-five feet . As we crossed the ice would crack under us and I was mighty glad to reach shore but Swift did n't seem to mind it in the least . One day , in order to cross when the ice was breaking up , he shoved a rowboat in front of him until the ice broke and then boarded the boat , rowing the rest of the way . He was as sure-footed as a cat , and I had difficulty sometimes in following him along the steep sidehills slippery with ice . Swift was tall , and Jim Sanborn was short . One day we were climbing Bonticou Crag . Working through the talus we came to a crevice . Swift with his long legs climbed over , and Jimmie wriggled through , but I had difficulty to do either . Swift worked out the details of the Hudson River crossing and took charge of the borings there . Before the profile of the gorge was found it was thought that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At first an informal contract called an agree-  | ment was let to the Cranford Company for sinking the shafts and making diagonal borings under the river . But after reaching two hundred feet they quit work on a technicality . This resulted in litigation which the city eventually won . Then it was decided to complete the shaft by day labor , Swift acting as general superintendent and engineer . Charles F. Roy was placed in charge of the shaft on the east bank and Beverly R. Harrison of the west shaft . Mr. Roy had had much experience in sinking mine shafts in Pennsylvania , and Harrison in the west on Reclamation service . One of the first things undertaken was excavation of chambers ( at the point where Cranford had quit work ) in which diamond drilling machines were installed by Sprague and Henwood of Scranton , and inclined drill holes were started while the operation of sinking the shaft was in progress . A description of the difficulty and results of the diamond drill borings is contained in a paper prepared by the assistant engineers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Proceedings of Municipal Engineers . While the shafts were being sunk the president of the Board of Water Supply had political aspirations for the candidacy for governor . He flirted with the labor element , and whenever there was the least bit of trouble at the shaft his sympathies would be with the labor delegates . This interfered with the discipline of the work and impaired progress . When Swift would urge the men to better effort they would complain that they were being driven too hard . They intimated that Swift was a slave-driver , and the decision would be against Swift , who would tell me that he could stand it no  | longer and wanted to resign . I would urge him to stay and complete the job , which he did . Swift had a difficult task sinking those shafts to a depth of eleven hundred feet under such conditions , but finally they were bottomed , by which time the borings were completed , and the profile fixed , so that the headings were turned and driven in about two hundred feet . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headings from the east shaft had been driven about two hundred feet , a blast in the heading brought in a heavy flow of water , approximately four hundred gallons a minute , and afterwards ascertained to be under full hydrostatic head . Only the temporary pumps were in position at the bottom of the shaft , and the leakage was too great for them . Swift borrowed some additional units from Dravo Corporation who were constructing the Breakneck tunnel . It was nip and tuck whether the leakage could be controlled and the water came pretty nearly to the top of the tunnel . Swift worked day and night , and finally conquered it . He then placed a concrete plug , reinforced with steel rails , against the face in which a pipe was placed and connected to the pump chamber three to four hundred feet in the shaft . There was head enough from the leak to force the water up there . I think this trouble would have conquered the ordinary engineer , but Swift was not an ordinary man . He afterwards resigned to go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Montana . With his sound judgment and good sense he straightened the matter out to the mutual advantage of the owners and the contractors . After that he became identified with Stevens and Wood of New York who employed him on various problems where his ability came into play . For  | the past two years ( 1936 ) he has been with the Reconstruction Finance Corporation in Washington . Lawrence C. Brink , who was also on the second division of the Rapid Transit Railroad Commission , came to the Board of Water Supply in its early days and was made division engineer of the Wallkill division . He was a Pennsylvanian , a graduate of Lehigh University . He was manly and likable in every way , but extremely obstinate ; when an idea became rooted in his mind no one could change it , but everyone liked him so much that they made allowances for this trait . He was a very hard worker and readily made friends with all who came in contact with him . The Pittsburg Contracting Company , a subsidiary of Booth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aqueduct contracts as engineer , and he accepted it . One of the contractors of the Wallkill division was Jim Hamilton of Elmore and Hamilton , who had the cut-and-cover work south of Wallkill siphon . Brink returned to see the work one day and complained to Hamilton about the requirements of the engineer of the Southern Aqueduct on his work near Elmsford . He remarked to Hamilton , " Now you know I never insisted on any such thing up here . " Hamilton replied , " Why , Lawrence , you were the worst of the whole bunch . " Brink continued with Booth and Flinn on City Aqueduct tunnel one until his untimely death from typhoid . Lazarus White was the division engineer in charge of the Esopus division . He had transferred from the rapid transit work in Brooklyn where he had made an excellent record . He was a Columbia graduate , and had had some experience with a corps of engineers in fortification work . He was an excellent engineer and thinker . You could rely on his judgment , and he had the  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as division engineer , but there was some question about his being given the position . This worried me a great deal because I knew how faithfully he had worked and how devoted he was to his work . After my return from a trip to the convention of the American Society of Civil Engineers in Mexico City the chief engineer assured me that White was being considered favorably for the promotion . But while I was worrying about the matter I mentioned to White that I was not sure whether the Commissioners would approve the recommendation . His reply was a manly one , " I have done my best , and am sorry if it has not met with their approval . " Nothing more . I made no mistake in recommending him . He carried out the work satisfactorily and before its completion I had the satisfaction of having him called by the chief engineer to take charge of one of the two divisions of the City Aqueduct tunnel . When the latter was nearly completed White resigned to become engineer for the firm of which Fred J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried out successfully the difficult work of tunneling the William Street subway . During the World War , still working for that firm , he supervised the construction of Camp Meade near Baltimore . Later he resigned to take up independent work as a member of the firm of Spencer , White and Prentis , and continues there ( 1936 ) . This firm has done much notable work and has a high standing in construction fields . They specialize on deep foundation work of which White is an authority . I am pleased to say that they have done well financially , and it is a great satisfaction to me to realize that my original judgment of White has been vindicated.  | John P. Hogan , White 's assistant , was a graduate of Harvard about 1903 and for a time was on the fourth division of the rapid transit work . Later he was with the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company , leaving them to join the Board of Water Supply about the spring of 1906 . There was excellent cooperation between White and Hogan , the latter becoming personnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each man complemented the other . When White transferred to the City Aqueduct Hogan became division engineer , completing the Esopus work . At its conclusion he was transferred in the same capacity to Staten Island for the work that included the Narrows crossing . Hogan knew no fear and while he did not seek a fight he never turned his back on one . A story is told of his coming down to the work on a local train when three tough young men got in , one sitting with him and two behind him . Hogan had the window open and his companion reached over and closed it . Hogan put it up ; his companion put it down and Hogan " biffed him in the eye . " Whereupon the three closed in on Hogan and there was a fight . Word got to the engine driver , who blew the whistle for the police , and when the train reached Highbridge all four were taken to the police station . Evidently the three toughs had friends at court ; when they appeared before the judge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocent young men " and they were all let off . When the United States entered the war Hogan was among the first to seek a commission , and went as captain with the Eleventh Engineers . He returned as a lieutenant colonel attached to the Second Army Headquarters , and with a Legion of Honor decoration . Hogan later became a partner of the firm of Barclay  | Parsons , who was a commander of the Eleventh Engineers . Now ( 1936 ) he has much consulting work , including the Bonneville Dam in Oregon , a project on the North Platte , Nebraska , the World 's Fair , and other work . I have a great admiration for Hogan 's common sense and judgment and hope his health will hold good for many years to enable him to do the work in store for him . Alexander Thomson , a graduate of Cornell , was an assistant engineer on the fifth division of the rapid transit work under me , and obtained a transfer about the spring of 1go6 to the Board of Water Supply . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ division engineer of the Newburgh division , the long stretch of cut-and-cover lying between Wallkill and Moodna siphons . The sameness and monotony of this part of the work did not lend itself to unusual notice . On its completion Thomson resigned and for a time was identified with the Truscon Company . After an illness he is now ( 1936 ) with a government organization located near Lockport , New York . Thomson had a good sense of humor and was always loyal in his work and to his friends . William L. Hanavan , one of Thomson 's assistants , was a courageous leader . He was formerly on the third division of the first subway , and was later section engineer on the Wallkill division of the Board of Water Supply . He sought a commission as soon as we entered the war , and was appointed a first lieutenant and assigned to the historic Ninth Infantry which did valiant work in France as a unit of the Second Division . It had more casualties than any other American division in the war . Hanavan must have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? only the humorous inci-  | dents that came to his attention . He was of Irish extraction and of course could not keep out of the war ; but resort to war would be the last thing he would think of , as he was always cheerful and of a kindly nature . He would fight for a principle , but not for love of fighting . C. Raymond Hulsart had served during college vacations in the Battery tunnel and later with the Board of Water Supply as section engineer in the Wallkill pressure tunnel and in the City Aqueduct tunnel . Still later he was a resident engineer on the tunnel division of the Public Service Commission . He also went over as a captain in the Eleventh Engineers . He was decorated with the British Military Cross and the American Distinguished Service Medal for gallantry at Cambrai on November 30 , 1917 . In that month a detachment under Hulsart was building a light railroad to carry up to the advance line which the British had established after General Byng had driven the Germans back in the victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught some of these men behind their barrage . There were some casualties and several were captured . Hulsart , aided by another officer , Sergeant Maclsaac ( son of the contractor ) , went through the barrage twice to bring out their men ? a valorous act which the British recognized by giving a citation and a military cross . This was followed by citations of the American forces . Hulsart came back a major and Maclsaac a captain . Before we entered the World War , Hulsart like many others realized what was coming and was one of the first among his fellow engineers to take up preparedness . He took the task in a very serious way , so that when the time came he was ready for a commission . He is  | now vice-president of the Atlas Lumnite Cement Company ( 1936 ) . Frank E. Winsor succeeded Merritt Smith as department engineer of the Southern Aqueduct . He was a graduate of Brown University and had had excellent experience with the Metropolitan Water Board of Massachusetts . He was simple in his habits and forwardfacing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was the greatest cooperation between us , and we have kept up our friendship all these years . On completion of the Board of Water Supply work Winsor was appointed chief engineer for the Providence Water Supply project , and he designed and supervised the construction of several earth dams and conduits for that work . He afterwards became chief engineer of the Metropolitan District Water Supply Commission of Massachusetts , constructing the great system of dams and conduits leading from the Ware and Swift Rivers . He still occupies that position ( 1936 ) . I have served with him on several commissions , and have been associated with him in reporting on engineering projects ? always with satisfaction to me , and full appreciation of his judgment and character . He is a brother of Harry D. Winsor who was my loyal and faithful assistant when I became chief engineer of the Board of Transportation . Carleton E. Davis was the engineer in charge of the Reservoir Department during the initial stage of the work and for most of the construction . He was a graduate of Massachusetts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canal work . He was a fine-looking chap , masterful and able . He resigned to become chief engineer of the Philadelphia Water Department and is now ( 1936 ) manager of the Philadelphia Suburban Water Company .  | George G. Honness , who had been a division engineer in the Southern Aqueduct Department , succeeded Davis as department engineer . He was likable and able , somewhat fiery in temper when young . I tried to get him as division engineer for one of the Northern Aqueduct divisions , but at that time he felt he could not leave his job . James F. Sanborn , a Harvard graduate ( 1899 ) , was also a subway man . He was appointed division engineer of the fifth division in 1903 . When I went with the Board of Water Supply he was transferred to me at my request . At first he had charge of investigations west of the Hudson River , helping the geologists with their work . This continued even after construction began . Meanwhile Sproul had resigned and one of his assistants , A. E. Kastl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become assistant to the State Engineer , Sanborn was given charge of the Peekskill division , and transferred to Wallkill when Brink resigned . Sanborn was an active man , popular with his associates and human in all his dealings . He had the true spirit of democracy ? a man was a man to him , no matter what his station in life . Like most of the engineers he had no physical fear and was ready to tackle any job regardless of its difficulties or danger . He had a scientific spirit and was exceedingly fond of geology . He remained on the work until it was finished , and then resigned to take up consulting work which he follows today ( 1936 ) . Sanborn was essentially a field man and I always enjoyed a trip over the work with him , for he had a point of view that always interested and helped me . He was quite tenacious of his views , but reasonable . I have only referred to those in the higher positions ,  | and could go on indefinitely with other men not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exceedingly few whom I do not regard as my friends . The Board of Water Supply was a great school , and I like to think that nearly all those who were with me advanced to higher positions at its close . There is a great pleasure in seeing men get ahead in life ; that , and seeing projects completed for the work they are designed to do are great satisfactions ? more than financial reward , although that is not to be despised . I had many friends among the contracting force ? superintendents , foremen , machinists , laborers ? and I am proud to have been associated with them . Now that the Catskill water is ministering to the needs of the city , those who use and benefit from it give scant thought to the engineers and contractors who brought it to them . This is to be expected , and we should not complain because our reward was in the consciousness of work well done ? though not perfect ? and in the many friendships we made during its progress . The morale of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent , and to that is due the fine results achieved . No task was too heavy for the individuals to undertake , and any expressed wish of the chief engineer would be obeyed with alacrity and cheerfulness . They never avoided danger , although it was sometimes surprising that they took the chances they did . Tunnel work , particularly the sinking of deep shafts , involves much hazard , but I never knew one of them to avoid taking the incidental risk . There was a rodman named Otto Feth assigned to the Esopus division on the contract of the Rondout pressure tunnel . Pump shaft five ? about five hundred feet deep ? had been sunk and partly lined , and the  | time had come to grout the lining . Otto went down on the platform about two hundred feet below surface . Bert Waite , section engineer , was with him . The grouting was to be done under fairly high pressure . Someone gave the signal to turn on the air before the hose was connected to the ejector . As a result the heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snake , and struck Otto in the face , shattering his jaw and knocking out his teeth . He was rendered unconscious , and had it not been for Waite he probably would have dropped to the bottom of the shaft . Otto was hurried to Rhinecliffe where a train took him to New York , and he was placed in St. Lukes Hospital . It was a long time before he regained consciousness and before he recovered , but he maintained his cheerfulness and did not lose his nerve . Years afterward he served with one of the copper companies in Chile for a number of years . The death of his wife there , leaving him with an infant daughter , induced him to return to the States to bring up his child . For the years past ( 1936 ) he has been with the water department of Montclair , New Jersey , serving there with credit as would be expected after his early training with the Board of Water Supply . It has been my observation in the construction of engineering works that it is more difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the job than on the sections that are regarded as most difficult . On hazardous work there is never trouble in getting men to serve and in keeping up quality . Everyone is on his toes , and is interested in all the details , and in seeing that they are done right . On the plain humdrum work men fall into the habit of thinking that everything is going right , when perhaps the standards are gradually  | lowering . It therefore behooves the engineer in charge to watch carefully the ordinary sections of his work , and to see that the subordinates are keeping up those standards . Accidents frequently occur in unexpected places where conditions appear to be normal . It is sometimes hard to make people realize that the ordinary work requires as careful supervision as that which is difficult and hazardous .  | DEPUTY CHIEF ENGINEER OF SUBWAY CONSTRUCTION I REPORTED as deputy chief engineer of subway construction to the Public Service Commission for the First District , January 15 , 1912 . The office was in the Tribune Building , 154 Nassau Street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a good-sized room unbearably hot in summer and uncomfortably warm in winter . The chief engineer was my old superior , Alfred Craven . Daniel L. Turner was deputy engineer of subway construction , and chief engineer 's aide ; Sverre Dahm was in charge of the designing division ; Jesse O. Shipman was engineer of the first division ; my old friend , J. H. Myers , second division ; C. V. V. Powers , third ; L. D. Fouquet , sewer division ; Charles N. Green , subsurface structure ; George L. Lucas , general inspector of materials . All of these engineers , except Fouquet and possibly Lucas , had been with the Rapid Transit Railroad Commission when I left to go with the Board of Water Supply . I was thrown quite intimately with Lucas and his work later on , and soon acquired a genuine affection for him , and respect for his judgment .  | During the six years or so that I had been with the Board of Water Supply the subway work had not been specially active . The so-called Centre Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some of the section being finished except for the tracklaying . It was placed in operation sometime in 1913 . Opposition to the Interborough Rapid Transit Company had developed for a number of reasons , most of them probably being the fault of the company , and an attempt was made to develop the so-called triboro system to include Centre Street loop and the subway under Lexington Avenue in Manhattan . Several contracts of the Lexington Avenue line had been let to the Bradley Construction Company in the preceding November ( 1911 ) and excavation was under way . When I joined the Public Service Commission there was discussion about the possibility of agreement with the two big operating companies ( I.R.T. and B.M.T. ) to enter partnership with the city , so to speak , to extend rapid transit . The need was great and the city was not in a position to build independent lines to compete with the other companies . There were many months of protracted discussion with representatives of the companies , and after many set-backs and sparring for wind the so-called dual contracts were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to contribute specific sums to the cost of construction and to furnish all money necessary for equipment . In consideration of this they were to receive preferential payments out of receipts ? that is , they were to receive interest and sinking fund payments on their investments , and a certain profit before the city would receive anything . Then the city was to receive its interest and  | sinking fund payments and a similar profit , after which if anything was left the city and company would share fifty-fifty . This provision was the cause of much contention among the opponents of the contract , who not only included real students of the problem , but persons who are opponents by nature , such as the socialists who wanted the city to build and operate all its transit facilities . In the drafting of these contracts the Commissioners and nearly every responsible employee had a finger . I had little to do with them , being essentially on construction , but I watched their progress with much interest . Among those active in the work was LeRoy T. Harkness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I was appointed and with whom I was thrown much in contact . He worked hard and faithfully ? sometimes all night ? and with his apparently frail physique I do not see how he stood it . Perhaps he had Scotch blood in him . I learned to know him very well , and we became good friends . He had an excellent legal mind and was honest to the core . He had moral and physical courage and was not afraid to take the stand on any question , before all corners high and low . Later he was appointed Chief of Rapid Transit , the title indicating that he was delegated by the Commissioners to look after broad details of rapid transit affairs . He was an earnest and enthusiastic supporter of Alfred Craven , and was a great help to him in any administrative affair involving the Commissioners and the public . He was intensely patriotic and when we entered the World War he received a commission as major . He was assigned to the Ordnance Department ,  | and had much to do with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Public Service Commission not only had the construction of the three hundred thirty million dollar Dual System to supervise ? a task enough to occupy its attention ? but also the regulation of the railroads , including the local rapid transit lines of the city . It was inevitable therefore that they should meet with opposition from other sources and make enemies . Then , too , since it was a public body there were those who wanted the jobs of the Commissioners . Of course the Commissioners made mistakes , as any human being in their positions would have done . The original Commission was five members , appointed by Governor Hughes in 1907 . Those whose terms expired during his administration were reappointed . Three of the members were : William I. Willcox , chairman ; Milo R. Maltbie , and E. M. Bassett . After the contracts had been drafted , but before final approval , the term of Chairman Willcox ended , and Governor Sulzer appointed as his successor , Supreme Court Justice E. E. McCall . J. Sergeant Cram , a Tammany man , a wealthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bassett . G. V. S. Williams came next . Thus the complexion of the personnel changed . Later a Mr. Wood was appointed . Judge McCall was an able man and one of rugged and honest characteristics , red-blooded and humanly disposed . He told me afterwards that he had been warned to beware of the dual contracts , because he would be attacked , if he approved them , by that portion of the press which was opposed to them . The Judge 's reply was that it made no difference to him ? he would do his duty as he saw it . He made a careful study of the con-  | tracts and expressed his approval . The Commission endorsed his action with Mr. Maltbie dissenting . They were signed March 13 , 1913 . The fare fixed in them was a flat five cents for which one could ride a distance of twenty-seven miles . When Whitman took office as Governor in 1915 there was a renewed attempt to oust the existing Commissioners . The Commission was charged with all sorts of shortcomings . Some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chairman McCall and Commissioner Cram for making a few local trips on private business in the official cars . The result of all this led to a sensational investigation by a committee of which Senator Thompson , a politician from around Niagara Falls , was made chairman . They appointed William Hayward , a picturesque lawyer of handsome physique , as their counsel . Like all investigations of its kind it was a one-sided affair , and the press gave little attention to anything but its sensational features . Hayward had a habit in examining a witness of bringing the general question at the end of the day 's session , so that the papers would get it and start people talking . The investigation was directed principally against the actions of the Commissioners , not against the engineering department , although that was affected . After many sessions the committee made a report of censure , resulting in charges to the Governor , who summoned the Commission before him for a hearing . As a result Chairman McCall and Commissioners Williams and Wood were removed , and political friends of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointees . Another appointee was Henry Hodge , a bridge engineer of considerable reputation . In place of Judge McCall , Oscar S. Straus , a man well known in  | public life , who had been Minister and Ambassador to the Turkish Empire , was appointed as chairman . The removal of Judge McCall has always seemed an outrage to me ? it may have been only a political expedient , but that could be all . During his incumbency I was thrown with him a great deal and learned to have a profound respect for his character and honesty of mind . I never knew him to play politics in his high office . He valued the services of Mr. Craven , the chief engineer , and seemed to have a real affection for him , although Craven was a Republican and made no apologies for it . He stood behind Mr. Craven through thick and thin , and seemed amused at times when the chief engineer came out in opposition to something that it would seem politic for him to favor . In my opinion the Judge was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I resented it when the public showed so little appreciation of his services . The community would be far better off if there were more like him in public life . He was very magnanimous in feeling and action . When the time came to sign the dual contracts it was made quite a ceremony . Judge McCall , realizing that his predecessor , Mr. Willcox , was deeply interested in these contracts , had asked him to sit with the Commission . After the Judge signed he turned to Mr. Willcox and said , " I 'm going to ask Mr. Willcox to do me the honor of witnessing my signature " ? which gratified Willcox very much . Of all those appointed , Travis Whitney was the most outstanding as he had honest , constructive views concerning the business of the Commission . As its secretary he was a guiding force in its affairs . He was very strongminded and inclined to be a little suspicious of people and their motives , but for some reason I seemed to  | have inspired his confidence and he was always a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case was honestly and completely explained to him and had merit he inclined favorably toward it . Paul M. Entenman was a section engineer who had worked himself to a frazzle , due to his great interest , and he developed tuberculosis ? which forced him to lay off for a long period . Paul 's financial situation was not of the best and he was not receiving any pay . His friend , Clifford M. Holland , came to me one day and fl explained the situation to me . We both went to Whitney and asked that Entenman be granted pay during his illness , which had been caused by devotion to work . In those years even sick leave did not permit continuance of salary . Whitney was convinced and gave the order that Entenman be paid . I have always remembered that about him . Entenman resigned afterwards and went to California in the hope that the climate would help him , which it apparently did , because when we entered the World War he went out making speeches for the Liberty Loan , much to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , becoming a partner of Allison . Later he married a young lady from North Carolina ? a school teacher in California . But he had trouble again from tuberculosis and for years was an invalid in his home in Banning until his death . Entenman had a good mind , and even while reclining on a couch because of illness he would make drawings for work in that region , which would have been a credit for draftsmanship if made by men without his handicap . I was very much attached to him . After the Commission had been reorganized there was a great deal of criticism of Mr. Craven . He had  | reached the age of seventy at that time , and naturally was not as active physically as in his younger days , but he still had ability and courage , and was the equal in this respect of the younger men . However , it was made so disagreeable for him that he retired from his position as chief engineer , and was made consulting engineer . I was next in line , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Mr. Hodge had his friend D. L. Turner in mind for the job , and he was appointed . Of course I was human enough to feel humiliated , but did not resign because I considered that if I did so it would be regarded as pique . I bit my lip and stayed . At that time there appeared an editorial in the Engineering News Record criticizing the Commission for not appointing me , but I was in no way responsible for this editorial . Turner was an able man , positive in his opinions , and a great student of rapid transit . He wrote many reports on it , and while I did not always agree with them they contributed much to the understanding of the problem . He was not essentially a field man , but he could get things done , not always in the easiest way but by force of his personality . While he was chief I supported him loyally . During an illness which necessitated his absence I was frequently consulted and I tried to carry out his ideas . After Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his usual way ; but as the years passed , and perhaps also because relief of executive duties diminished his interest in affairs , he gradually stayed away . When the retirement law became effective he applied and was granted his well earned retirement . He had been in city service for about thirtysix years ( since 1884 ) .  | Mr. Craven had a high sense of duty ; nothing ever swerved him from doing what was right . All who were associated with him had the highest respect for his character . That respect continued even when Mr. Craven denied any request made of him . This feeling extended to the contractors , who usually accepted his judgment . I have often remarked that he had no hinge in his moral backbone . He always took what was coming , good or bad , with courage , showing no undue elation or disappointment . About the only time that I ever saw him show any temper was on the Titicus Dam work . We were starting to build a boundary wall . Some half crazed farmer who owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoot him . This act made him furious , but he did not quail or lose his head . During the World War Mr. Craven served as a member of the Naval Advisory Board on the nomination of the American Society of Civil Engineers . It was a great privilege to have worked with him . The physical plan of the dual system was necessarily a compromise between the different views of the city 's and the companies ' engineers , with suggestions from the public ? which had to be reconciled ? so it was no one man job ; like all compromised plans it was not one hundred per cent perfect . Mr. Turner had much to do with the plan and many of the good features of it are his . Take it all in all , it was very good , and as a rule followed the logic of the situation . Contract three included the completion of the " H " system ? that is , the old subway running up Fourth Avenue was extended above Forty-Second Street up Lexington Avenue into the Bronx ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seventh  | Avenue and other streets , and under the East River into the borough of Brooklyn . With the layout of the old subway this was manifestly the thing to do . ( The work which had been let in 1911 on Lexington Avenue was included in this contract . ) Under contract four the Brooklyn company was given entrance into Manhattan by means of a tunnel under the East River at Whitehall Street , thence up Broadway through Times Square to Fifty-ninth Street , then east under that street and Sixtieth Street ; and it was intended then to go over the Queensboro Bridge . ( This contract also absorbed the Centre Street loop . ) It was evidently a mistake to include the Queensboro Bridge in this plan as the work had not long advanced before the Queens residents made a protest , demanding a tunnel instead of a bridge . They were supporting Mr. Degnon of the Degnon Construction Company , who had large property interests in Long Island City and other parts of Queens . In the interests of modification the Degnon Company offered that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred thousand dollars from the price of their contract for the line up to that point , and also agreed not to bid in excess of five million dollars for the under-river contract ? which seemed very cheap . The modification was adopted and bids advertised . It was a surprise when the Patrick McGovern Company presented a low bid of about four million three hundred thousand , which included the tunnel proper and the subway and " L " approach to the " L " line in Queens Plaza . And I believe they made money on the contract . I was heartily in favor of the tunnel scheme , feeling that the bridge plan would have seriously curtailed the usefulness of that structure . This opinion has been  | justified by developments . The rapid transit tracks would have reduced the width of the main roadway about half . Considering that today the bridge with its full width in use , with an added upper roadway , is so badly congested in the rush hour , the change in plan is more than justified . As soon as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have noticed that action , which students of a situation see is necessary , is often seriously delayed because of lack of appreciation of its need by those in authority . When this realization comes to them there is an immediate demand for action , which leads to everybody turning themselves upside down to get things going . So in this case the designing force under Mr. Dahm and his able lieutenant , A. I. Raisman , was greatly augmented , as was the field force , and the contracts were turned out at a rapid pace . As it developed later , it would have been better to have taken more time to make the plans in more detail before advertising for bids . There is no doubt that there would have been less litigation eventually . The procedure was to include in the contract drawings a general plan and profile called " A " drawings . These showed practically no details . Then there was a set of " B " drawings indicating that sewer construction was necessary . These were made in detail and , generally speaking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans . Then there followed the " C " drawings which showed the structures with typical plans longitudinally and cross sections , not necessarily covering the whole section but enough to give the bidder a good idea of the character of the work . Steel could not be detailed by the contractor from these drawings .  | Then there was issued a set of " D " and " E " drawings , showing as much as could be ascertained of subsurface and surface structures existing at the time , together with whatever borings had been taken by the Commission along the line of work . These " D " and " E " drawings were necessarily not guaranteed and the contract so stated ; they were given to the contractor for what they were worth in an effort to help him . When one realizes the tangle of pipes and other structures underlying the streets , placed there from year to year , some of them abandoned or with meager information about them available , it may be seen that the maps could not be guaranteed for correctness . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contract was let the designers proceeded to prepare another set of plans called " working drawings , " giving to the contractor the details of the structure , and from these he could make his " shop drawings . " The steel work was always sublet ; the American Bridge Company obtained most and had a skilled force capable of making the shop drawings . These were one thousand in all , and had to be checked by the Commission 's designers before the fabric of steel could be made . Sometimes it was necessary for the drawings to go back and forth several times for correction . Dimensions of the parts , spacing of the rivets , number of rivets , and all such details , had to be carefully gone over . If the working drawings could have been sent out when bids were received there is no doubt that time would have been saved , particularly during the World War . Had the Kaiser not broken loose in Europe in 1914 I doubt whether there would have been so many lawsuits , but the war raised the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard of men .  | Jobs were so plentiful and at such high wages that labor did not feel that it had to work to keep a job ? a better one could be got by quitting . That demoralized the labor market ; laborers became scarce and the contractors were bidding against each other for them ? a further demoralization . The turnover of labor was enormous . Sometimes a man would be on the job for only a few weeks , hardly accustomed to routine , when he would leave . The government placed embargoes on steel and other materials , and it was frequently necessary to go to Washington to have the embargo lifted for a particularly urgent matter . It was a serious situation . The contractors , apparently starting out with a paying job , would find that their costs were running so high that they were badly in the red every month . The result was that they were disgruntled , and began to look around for a way to recoup themselves . They hit on the scheme of suing the city for alleged delays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devise . The delay in plans of the subsurface structure restoration was a source of much complaint . Sometimes the erection of steel , or other progress , was held up , and the contractor would become embittered , blaming all his woes on the engineers . The situation was not anyone 's fault ; we must blame it on the World War . Looking back I believe it would have been good business , and very equitable , to have gotten together with the contractors and adjusted the matter ? giving them compensation for some of their extra expense caused by the war , for which they or the city were not responsible . As it was the contractors collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in litigation for alleged damages , much of it in my opinion undeserved . If a contractor  | mismanaged his work , and as a result ran up an abnormal bill of expense , he collected much of it through litigation ? to which he was in no way entitled . Most of the bids were received in the period of low prices when competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contractors would have pulled through with a profit even though no war had occurred . Of course the war complicated the matter and forced even some of the good ones to the wall . Furthermore it demoralized many good contractors , putting them in a state of mind where they felt that subway work was unduly expensive . Despite the difficulties in construction engendered by the war the subway work went on , and was so far completed that 12.01 a.m. of August 1 , 1918 was fixed as the date when the " H " system of the I.R.T. was to be placed in operation . The night of July 31 was a very busy one , because in a very short time the tracks at Park Avenue and at Times Square on Forty-second Street were to be cut and changed so as to permit the new operation . The engineering part of the work was done very efficiently by the force of the I.R.T. and the new lines were ready for operation on time . The mistake ? in my opinion ? was in not educating the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the rush hour of August 1 there was great confusion . The old route of the Forty-second Street subway going north , starting from Brooklyn Bridge station , ran up Lafayette Street , Fourth Avenue , and Park Avenue to Forty-second Street . Then it turned west with an express station in front of the Grand Central Station , continuing to Broadway , and went north under Broadway . The changes in operation by the new plan called for trains to run up from Brooklyn Bridge by the same  | route as far as Forty-second Street , where the subway turned on a diagonal line with a new express station under the present Commodore Hotel , and continued north up Lexington Avenue . The new operation on the west side , north of Chambers Street , ran under Varick Street and Seventh Avenue to Times Square , where an extension station was established , and then joined the old route under Broadway . These east side and west side subways were four-track trunk lines . The new operation left unused the old four-track subway under Forty-second Street between Times Square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the new routes were opened the people who lived on the upper west side who used to go downtown by way of Forty-second Street and Park Avenue found they could not do so , and the greatest confusion prevailed . The shuttle line was so swamped by those trying to use the old route that the Commissioners ordered operation of it suspended until the public became accustomed to the new downtown route south of Times Square . A new station had been constructed for the shuttle , with a center platform at the Lexington Avenue end of the line , but Mr. Hedley , general manager of the I.R.T. , declined to use it , saying that the station facilities were not adequate , and that he was afraid of confusion , so the station is there today and has never been used . Of course there was a great uproar , and the papers criticized the results without reasoning out the cause . The New York World came out with a humorous poem about the shuttle . Mr. Turner went away on his vacation on the morning of August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the storm was raging . However , in due  | time the public became accustomed to the new operation and liked it ; and if it were changed back now there would probably be great criticism . From time to time thereafter other portions of the Dual System were placed in operation , but later than the date which had been in mind when the dual contracts were signed because of the retarded progress of the work caused by the war . I remember the night when the Interborough was extended beyond the Atlantic Avenue station in Brooklyn , up Flatbush Avenue , out on Eastern Parkway and Nostrand Avenue . The new lines there involved a mileage greater than those of the original subway of contracts one and two , I believe . At Atlantic Avenue a considerable amount of temporary construction had to be removed in order to effect junction with the new tracks . This work was done by the force of the I.R.T. with its usual good results . I have always had a great admiration for the engineering force of that company . When they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faithfully and intelligently maintained the structure . George H. Pegram , their chief engineer , was a man of long experience , having been chief engineer of the Union Pacific Railroad before he came to the Manhattan Elevated Railroad , and then to the I.R.T. He was , and is ( 1936 ) , ably assisted by Mr. Gardner , his designing engineer , and in the field by Mr. Carpenter and Donald M. Waite . When anything happens these men are right on their jobs , and with them around one can always feel confident . I am glad to testify these things about these engineers . In conference differences in opinion might arise on many points , but we never questioned their honesty of intent or their ability . I  | value the association with them . Mr. Pegram was honored by being made president of the American Society of Civil Engineers . He has a great deal of dry humor , and is as " quick on the trigger " in repartee as any man I know . In the course of the work the New York Municipal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consolidated Railroad Company , with which contract four was made , went into the hands of the receiver and underwent reorganization . It is now known as the Broadway-Manhattan Transit Corporation . W. S. Menden is its president ( 1936 ) and before that he was general manager . Menden has been the " kingpin " for many years . When there was any issue with the Interborough , and we asked Mr. Pegram to attend a conference he came with several of his staff . When a similar conference was called about the affairs of the S.M.T. , Mr. Menden came alone . He is an able , masterful man , positive in his opinions . He knows the operation of the road from A to Z , and apparently his whole life is wrapped up in it . In any argument with him he seemed uncompromising , but the more I knew him the more I liked him . Considering the magnitude and hazardous character of the work there were relatively few accidents ? no dynamite explosions so far as I know . The invention of the nonfreezing explosive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand the inspection was far more rigid ? including that of the fire department . Under the regulations , which were strictly enforced , the detonators were stored at a distance from the dynamite , thus insuring more safety . A number of notable and regrettable accidents , however , did occur .  | In 1913 on the Bradley Company 's section eight at Fifty-eighth Street the headings had been turned at base of shaft , and the roof had been timbered although the rock did not appear bad . However , there were two incline cleavage seams hidden from view , starting about at the spring line and meeting like a hip roof over the crown . Following a blast one Saturday evening , when the gang had returned to work the heavy mass of rock below the junction of those seams fell , killing ten men . I had just returned from a minor accident farther uptown when word reached me of this one , and I hurried there , remaining all night . The coroner would not let the contractor proceed in what seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several suggestions to him , but he paid no attention to them , and intimated that he would put me under arrest . This delayed the recovery of the bodies , and I naturally reported it to Mr. Craven . In the morning I telephoned to Judge McCall who came to the scene . After being told of the interference of the coroner , in his positive way the Judge told me that if he interfered again to throw him off the work . This was said in the presence of some reporters , who published it in Monday 's papers . As soon as I saw the press notices I went to Judge McCall 's office to tell him that I had not given such information of his instructions to the press . But before I saw him I met Whitney , the secretary of the Commission , who said that the reporter had been to see him , and had asked if he had so instructed me . The Judge 's reply was , " Yes , I told him that if anyone interfered , including the Pope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whitney induced them to omit the reference to the Pope . An inquest followed shortly after and I was called back from Ottawa , where  | I was attending the convention of the American Society of Civil Engineers , to testify . The verdict of the coroner 's jury was a censure of the contractors and the Commission . In September , 1915 , an inspector telephoned me that a decking and timbering of the cut on Seventh Avenue between Twenty-fourth and Twenty-fifth Streets had entirely collapsed . Going there I found that the statement was true ? every bent of timber near Twenty-fifth Street , to where the steel had been erected and riveted just north of Twenty-fourth Street , had fallen like a pack of cards beginning at the north end , due to the lack of longitudinal bracing . This , to say the least , was very unfortunate , and reflected no credit on the contractor who was responsible under the contract . Fortunately there were no fatalities . The United States Realty and Improvement Company was the contractor , and they got to work at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energetically . Ten days later I was at a dinner of the Harvard Engineering Society at the Crescent Club , Bay Ridge , when I received word that a section of timber on Broadway at the northwest corner of Thirty-eighth Street had failed . I went at once to the scene . This was another contract of the same company . It had caused a taxi to drop into the cut , and a woman passenger was killed . This was caused by a fall of rock from the west side of the cut , knocking out some timber supports of the decking . While there was no apparent fault on the part of the contractor I realized that two accidents happening within ten days would disturb public confidence and subject the Commission to serious criticism . Judge McCall and the other Commissioners appeared  | at the scene and temporary headquarters were established at the Hotel Normandie nearby . Presently Mayor John P. Mitchel and District Attorney Whitman came . The next day the Mayor appointed a committee of engineers to make a thorough investigation of the subway cut , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be taken to strengthen street supports , and ordered that traffic be stopped meanwhile over the cuts until it was found that they were safe . I felt these accidents very keenly because they could not help but reflect on the engineering department , and I remember saying to Mr. Harkness that if anyone was to be sacrificed I was perfectly willing to take the blame . With few exceptions everyone stood by and did what they could to help . It gradually straightened itself out , but the contractor was under heavy expense for damages . Soon after this , having in mind the criticism on account of it , the new Commissioner , William Haywood , suggested that a mining engineer friend , Herbert B. Moulton , be appointed to have general supervision of the work of supporting the trenches . I could properly offer no objection and Moulton was appointed , doing good work . He had good common sense and handled his work well and tactfully , and there was little friction . We worked well together . A part of the Dual System was two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montague Streets . Fred Noble was the division engineer who was to have charge of these tunnels , and he was assigned to the task of preparing specifications and the standards of design . These specifications were made with care and everything was set to go ahead with the contracts . When they  | were let , Noble resigned and in spite of all entreaties persisted in his determination . I could not understand why he did it , but finally came to the conclusion that he did not like to face four years of " scrapping " with contractors . He was an excellent engineer with a fine mind , but he preferred research and designing to field work . On Noble 's resignation I suggested that Sanborn be made division engineer , but Mr. Craven , aided by Mr. Turner , selected the former chief engineer , George S. Rice , who was appointed . I had known Mr. Rice since Croton Aqueduct days when he was deputy chief of the Aqueduct Commission ? in the days of scamp work when he stood by the hard-pressed engineers . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compressed air work was naturally trying , and Clifford Holland , who had been Noble 's assistant , would have the brunt of the work . I recommended that the work be divided ? the land work arranged in a separate division under Mr. Rice , and the tunnel division under Holland . Holland was only thirty-two years old , and it was unusual to select a man so young . But the chief approved , as did Mr. Whitney , and Holland was appointed , taking hold with his customary vigor . When I came back to the subway work in 1912 , I met Holland for the first time and was impressed with his enthusiasm and sound sense . He had reported on the old Battery tunnel the day after he graduated from Harvard in 1906 ( when I was with the Board of Water Supply ) . He continued on that work until its completion , learning much about subaqueous work , and among other things the way not to do things . Then he had a bit of experience on cut-and-cover work on the  | Fourth Avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul Entenman . No task was too heavy for Holland , and he always kept his finger on the pulse of the job . If anything unusual happened on the work in the middle of the night he would take his little Dodge runabout and " beat it " for the tunnel . He was the boss of the job ; disputes with the contractor seldom were passed up to the chief engineer or to me , as Holland settled them on the spot . It was interesting to see a man like George H. Flinn ? masterful and impatient ? coming to Holland to find out what was wrong and to seek advice . Afterwards when the Fourteenth Street tunnel was let to Booth and Flinn , and the Sixtieth Street tunnel to Patrick McGovern , Holland was given charge of those jobs , having roughly twenty-five million dollars worth of construction under his supervision . He had the respect of the contractors always , and McGovern would confer with him as did Flinn . He had a loyal competent group of resident engineers under him , including J. B. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and later , C. Raymond Hulsart . He made a fine record for himself . His youth enhanced the interest that the people took in this man . While the work was in progress but well advanced , the New Jersey , and the New York , State Bridge and Tunnel Commissions , working jointly , were making studies for a vehicular tunnel under the North River . Preliminary plans had been made by Goethals , their consulting engineer , assisted by J. F. O'Rourke who had a scheme for making this tunnel of heavy concrete blocks . The Commissioners began to look about for a chief engineer , and they called a number of engineers into conference as well as such administrators as John  | H. Delaney . I was one of those called , and was asked if I were the appointing power whether I would select an engineer of international reputation , or a younger man without the reputation but who was experienced in subaqueous work . I sensed that they had Holland and Goethals in mind ; I replied that I could see no objection to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would soon grow out of his youth . Some time after this they appointed Holland , then only thirty-six years old ? a rare honor for a young man . He started immediately to build up his organization ? taking Snow and some others with him ? and to outline his plans . He rejected O'Rourke 's doubledeck tunnel , estimated at twelve million five hundred thousand dollars , and presented his own plan calling for two tubes , twenty-nine and a half feet outside diameter with two ten-foot roadways in each tube . Public hearings were held ( about a half dozen ) in New York and New Jersey . Holland 's plan was opposed by O'Rourke who attacked it from every angle , supported by Goethals . If Holland had been defeated that probably would have been the end of his career , as people would have decided that he was presumptuous in attacking a plan presented by such men as O'Rourke and Goethals . However , at these hearings Holland made it clear that the double-deck plan was wrong . O'Rourke designed it for three lanes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A little thought shows the absurdity of this , as three lanes would leave only a few inches between the hubs of the cars . The speed would be slow in consequence , and no doubt there would eventually be only two lanes in use . Holland 's plan was estimated to cost twenty-eight  | million dollars ? more than twice that of O'Rourke'sbut Holland showed conclusively that O'Rourke 's plan was grossly underestimated . So Holland 's plan was approved and work went ahead accordingly . Following a trip to Europe in 1921 , where he examined another tunnel , Holland recommended that his tunnel be lined with enamel tile . That and other items such as ventilation , which had not been developed for the first estimate , ran the cost up to fifty million . Holland went at the job energetically and scientifically , and , instinctively studious , he evolved the successful ventilation system used in the tunnel . But just two days before the meeting of the shields of his first tube under the Hudson River , in October , 1924 , Holland died in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following a tonsil operation . His death , was a great shock to his friends and to the Commission , and in gracious recognition of his good work the Commission voted to name the tunnel in his honor . I never go through the tunnel without thinking of him , and wondering what would have been his career had he lived . The successful completion and operation of the tunnel while he was still young would have given him much prestige . Milton H. Freeman was Holland 's assistant on the East River tunnel work . He was a graduate of the University of Michigan , and had served with Alfred Noble on the Pennsylvania tunnel work , and with the Board of Water Supply on Rondout siphon at High Falls . He had had a wealth of experience , was quiet , modest , and thorough in everything he did , and more than conscientious . If his work was anything less than one hundred per cent perfect he worried about it . He would work long hours to supervise any critical part of his  | job . His associates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were coming home at night from some social function they would frequently meet Freeman going out to inspect his work . One day , walking with him through the Rondout tunnel , a side support on one of the side forms for the inverted concrete had knocked loose . It did not affect the quality of the work in any way but had made the construction joint , where the side wall concrete joined in , awry . I casually remarked as we passed it , " That got away from somebody " ? meaning that the carpenter who placed the braces had not been overly careful . Freeman took this to heart as a reflection on his work , which was far from intended . When the Canal Street station of contract four was placed in operation leakage appeared under the Centre Street loop , because of the design which called for waterproofing of new structure to be made good to the waterproofing of the floor of the old structure above . This was practically impossible to do , and any little settlement of the new structure would be bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The new structure was almost entirely below ground water surface in more or less gravel . It would naturally settle slightly when the back fill on either side of the old subway was placed on its roof . This leakage in length of station eventually reached ioo g.p.m . The operating company complained and the public criticized it . One of the vaudeville actors remarked in a skit , " rf all the other places in New York became dry , the Canal Street station would remain wet . " After considering the method of stopping the difficult leak it was decided that grouting would be the most practical . Mr. Freeman was borrowed from Mr. Hol-  | land to supervise the work because he had had more experience than anyone else available . In assigning him I remarked that I did not think grouting would stop all the leakage ? perhaps not more than ninety per cent . Freeman quietly answered , " I think it will do better than that . " He took charge and remained with the work until it was substantially finished , watching it most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed he knew his problem and how to approach it . The inspector told me that Freeman had stayed on the work fifteen hours at a time ? all night , in fact , to see that the men used the proper density of mix , because he felt that the stoppage of the hole in which they were pumping the grout would jeopardize the success of the plan . When he finished , the leakage had been reduced to less than 2 g.p.m . This was about 1918 and the leakage has never reappeared to this time ( 1936 ) . I doubt whether any of the other assistants could have made such a success of the job . It was one of the things which justified Holland 's remark that " Freeman makes other engineers ' reputations . " When Holland went to the North River tunnel he took Freeman with him as his first assistant , and when Holland died he was made chief engineer . Unfortunately his overconscientiousness was his undoing ; he would take his work home with him and worry about it . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying about six months after his appointment as chief engineer . Following his death the Commission named the entrance plaza in Manhattan Freeman Square in his memory , but the name never came into popular use . Thus passed a faithful hardworking engineer who thought of self last and duty first . He was a noble character .  | CHIEF ENGINEER OF THE BOARD OF TRANSPORTATION IN January , 1919 , there was a change in the state administration as Alfred E. Smith had been elected Governor . Early in that year the legislature passed a law taking the construction functions away from the Public Service Commission , and placing them in the hands of a Transit Construction Commissioner to be appointed by the Governor . The Public Service Commission had been reduced to a single member by that time , and Lewis Nixon , the naval contractor , formerly of the United States Navy , had been appointed by Governor Smith as a Commissioner , assisted by one or more deputies . It will be seen that the Public Service Commission had been more or less the football of politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a regulatory body it had tacked onto it the work of building the subways . This imposed too much work on this body . It would probably have been better had it been left to such an organization as the old Rapid Transit Railroad Commission .  | Governor Smith looked around for someone to fill the office of Transit Construction Commissioner . One day a man prominent in Tammany Hall approached me with a proposition to accept the job , representing that it was mine if I wanted it . I had no ambition for a political job , preferring to stick to engineering , and I politely declined his flattering offer . A year or two after this I met Governor Smith at a public dinner . The gentleman who introduced us said , " Governor , this is Mr. Ridgway , " and the Governor replied , " Yes , I offered him a job once and he declined it " ? showing his excellent memory . I have understood that others were considered before the final selection of John H. Delaney ? an excellent choice which could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and appointed Daniel L. Ryan as his assistant . I had met Mr. Delaney more or less casually , but I did not know him well , and did not know of his good qualities , his ability for hard work , and good judgment . He was afterwards chairman of the Board of Transportation , and I will have more to say about him and Mr. Ryan in connection with that work . - Thecity government at this time was under the influence of Mr. Hylan as mayor , who was an earnest advocate of the continuance of the five-cent fare , and who favored the control of the transit system entirely by the city . As the city was not ready to embark on an extensive system of subway construction , and as the construction of elevated railroads was no longer in favor , nothing was inaugurated under the regime of the Transit Construction Commissioner . But that part of the work of the Dual System which was not completed was carried on to its finish , and many studies          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
