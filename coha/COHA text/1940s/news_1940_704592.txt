txt By the almanac and the Weather Bureau , 1:24 p. m. today heralded the arrival ' of spring . By the fur coats to be seen on the street and the reading of 34 degrees on the Boston Common weather kiosk around noon ? b-r-r-r ? it could scarcely be called the season of Maypole dances , the opening of the baseball season , twittering birds and posies , tra la . Officially , this is the first day of spring  --  the day of the vernal equinox when the sun , at 1:24 crossed the-equator on its summer run north and at that moment made days and nights of equal length . With this scientific division of time there came also customary and time-honored " signs " of less mathematical import ? reports ( verified ) of the : ' first " robin , and along Park Drive , crocuses popping up through the last trace of snow in vivid gold , white and purple . Equally dependable signs were to be found along the waterfront , where shipping men and yachts England have brought with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nesmith , meteorologist in charge of the weather bureau in Boston , repotted today . Accumulation of snows at the headwaters of streams has repeated conditions very similar to those existing at the time of the floods of 1936 . On the other hand , the melting snows are relieving the dryness of the subsoil . " The hardships occasioned by recent storms may therefore work out to the good of the general community , " commented Mr. NcsAnith on the soil improvement , , " and we enter the spring of 194 ( 1 with a prospect for a while at least of better than normal weather . " Flood . Danger Present Because of flood possibilities the weather man discouraged the natural eagerness of New Englanders for an immediate spring and a sudden thaw . He pointed out that the safest way for the snow to vanish was by continuation of the present process of gradual running off through melting by day and light freezing at night . Reviewing the closing of winter today , Mr. Nesmith noted that it had been marked by more than the usual amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the normal during every month . An extraordinary feature of the winter proved to be the absence of any zero weather during the long cold spell from Dec. 22 to Feb. 4 . It is rare that so long a dip of the thermometer does not bring the mercury down to the zero level . Up to the storm of St. Valentine 's Day , snow lagged less than normal . But with this storm and that following a week later , the deficiency was made up in less than a week . Sure sign of spring on the waterfront is the change from ocean liner to summer type of vessels on the all-water Boston-New York run of the Eastern Steamship Lines . The " white boats " came out of their winter 's exile and arc today back in service , the steamer Boston sailing from India Wharf at 5:30 p . In. today for New York , and the steamer New York sailing from New York at that same hour for Boston . They replace the Acadia and the Saint John , both of which are today preparing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lily gardens . On to Washington Another unmistakeable sign of spring on the waterfront is the start of the annual trek of thousands of high school students to Washington , some of whom.reach Washington In time for the famed cherry blossom festival . The trek this year starts next Friday when about 30 students from the Falmouth High School , come to India Wharf Boston by bus , embark on the steamer Boston , and sail for New York , en route to Washington , This group plan to remain In Washington live days , a part of the , school 's plan of an educational tour . They are the first of nearly 5,000 students that will sail from Boston during the spring and summer months on the Eastern Steamship Lines . Beginning Friday , April 5 , and 1 " : 0 Ch week-end thereafter , groups from all parts of Massachusetts , New Hampshire , Maine , Vermont , and ithode Island , will sail from Boston to take in the cherry blossom trip and , later in the spar , to visit the World 's Fair at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday at 5 p. m , for Bermuda with about 300 Greater Boston residents fur the special eight-day cruise of the Eastern . Passengers use the steamer for their hotel during the nearly live days they remain at Bermuda . A similar cruise starts the same time from New York with the Acadia . For those who were skeptical of this being spring , judging by the nip in the air , visible proof was at hand for those who had to " see " the natural phenomenon . School teachers who were able to demonstrate the sun 's change for their pupils solved a great problem . The demonstration was available to anyone who wanted to rig up a sheet of paper with a small hole In the middle on a window pane upon which the sun was shining . Through the aperture the sun 's rays traced a path in the forenoon which varied from the direction of a similar path thrnuich tie hole at and alter 1:24 p. tn . This method of " seeing " spring come in is explained by Dr. C. C. astronomer at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Associated Press : Fasten a piece of paper , Dr. Wylie says , it or 10 inches square , and with a small bole in it , at the top of a window , so that when the sun is shining , this hole will make a spot of light on the floor . Mark the path of this spot every 15 minutes for about two hours . The best hours were 8 to 10 in the morning or 2 to 4 in the afternoon . Before March 20 such a path has been a curve , a hyperbola , a figure roughly shaped like a crescent . The concave of the curve , or horns of the crescent , have been pointing north . But today the path was a straight line . The line moreover , Dr. Wylie says , points east and west . After March 20 the curve will appear again , but upside down , that is with the concave of the hyperbola pointing south . In the few days before and after the spring crossing , Dr. Wylie says the line is almost flat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction of the line is east and %VI sl.
