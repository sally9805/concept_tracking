txt THE FIRST THIRD OF THE CENTURY a Nature not outside society , but its proper basis , the chief nourisher of life 's feast ' . Its population is for him the real England ; they are the commons ' . He protests against the new habit of calling them the lower orders ' , a vile phrase he was wont to hear from the lips of tax-devourers , bankers , brewers , monopolists of every sort , but also from their clerks , from the very shopkeepers and waiters , and from the very fribbles stuck up behind the counter to do the business that ought to be done by a girl ' . Brewers figure in this list . Cobbett was a doughty champion of beer , and defended it against tea-slops ' , but the beer should be brewed by the peasant from his own barley , as was done of yore . He is for everything old . We find him trying to revive the old country sports and country dancing . Such was Cobbett . In his own day he was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hero to many more , and thirty years after his death an able man , Sir Henry Bulwer , ' who had sat with him in Parliament , wrote an interesting and in some ways a friendly biographical sketch of his career , which none the less misses the whole point of it . Bulwer can discover in Cobbett 's career no cause ' at all ; he regards it as an entirely undirected exhibition of pugnacity and self-assertion ; its motive he finds to be partly mischief , partly vanity , and partly mere sport ' . No doubt Cobbett was pre-eminently a sportsman in every sense of that Protean term , but the fact that Bulwer saw no more in him is a significant measure of the failure of Cobbett 's cause ; the cause of anti-industrialism had failed so completely that it had become incredible as the mainspring of the activities of anyone more practical than a poet or an art-critic . Yet Bulwer makes one very good point . Cobbett , he says , represented journalism , and fought the fight of jour-nalism , , against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day . Let us not forget the blind and uncal-culating intolerance with which the law struggled against opinion from 1809 to 1822 . Writers during this period COBBETT were transported , imprisoned , and fined , without limit or conscience . The contest was one of life and death . Amidst the general din of the battle , but high above all shouts more confused , was heard Cobbett 's bold , bitter , scornful voice , cheering on the small but determined band which defied tyranny without employing force . The failure of the last prosecution against the Register was the general failure of prosecutions against the Press , and may be said to have closed a contest in which government lost power every time that it . made victims . ' 1 The same writer has a striking account of the impression produced in the polite world by Cobbett 's death . His death struck people with surprise , for few could remember the commencement of his course , and there had seemed in it no middle and no decline . He left a gap in the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill , for his loss was not merely that of a man but that of a habit ? of a dose of strong drink which all of us had been taking for years , and which it was impossible for anyone again to concoct so strongly , so strangely , and with so much spice and flavour , or with such a variety of ingredients . And there was this peculiarity in the general regret ? it extended to all persons . Whatever a man 's talents , whatever a man 's opinions , he sought the Register on the day of its appearance with eager-ness , read it with amusement , partly , perhaps , if De la Roche-foucault is right , because , whatever his party , he was sure to see his friends abused , but partly also because he was certain to find , amidst a great many fictions and an abundance of impudence , some felicitous nickname , some excellent piece of practical-looking argument , some capital expressions , and very often some marvellously fine writing . ' 2 Cobbett , in fact , had failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertainment . The intellectual leadership of the rising generation fell neither to Godwin with his sky-scraping audacities , nor to // Cobbett with his immense journalistic vogue , but to an in-dustrious and pedestrian writer who , despising alike abstract rights and historic traditions , set himself to devise practical legal remedies for concrete wrongs . The future lay with Benthamism . Jeremy Bentham was born in 1748 , the son of a wealthy London solicitor , and died in 1832 . His father early detected his remarkable abilities and hoped that he had begotten a future Lord Chancellor , but before young Ben-tham was out of his teens ' he was so much impressed by the defects of the legal system he was set to study , that he deter-mined to devote his life to the alteration rather than the administration of the law . Long afterwards he related how a single phrase inspired his whole career . In a pamphlet by the scientist and radical Priestley , he came across the words the greatest happiness of the greatest number ' . It was by that pamphlet and that phrase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the subject of morality , public and private , were determined . At the sight of it , I cried out as it were in an inward ecstasy , like Archimedes on the discovery of the fundamental principle of hydrostatics , Eureka . ' Again : ( " Have I " , he asked , " a genius for anything ? What can I produce ? " That was the first inquiry he made of himself . Then came another . " What of all earthly pursuits is the most important ? " " Legislation " was the answer Helvetius . He turned it over in his thoughts ; he sought every symptom he could discover in his natural disposition or acquired habits . " And have I indeed a genius for legislation ? " I gave myself the answer , fearfully and tremblingly , " Yes . " ' i Once his course was chosen Bentham set to work , and methodically he worked away for sixty years , issuing the gospel of Benthamism in a long succession of pamphlets and BENTHAM treatises . Ample wealth set him free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest number ' . His first publication ( 1776 ) ' was a Fragment on Government which was an attack on Blackstone , whose eulogy of English Law in his Commentaries on the Laws of England was the orthodoxy of the day . But Bentham was never content merely to criticize . He had compared himself with Archi-medes , and he was first and foremost an inventor . He set himself to devise improvements in the clumsy machine of English law much as James Watt set himself to improve the rudimentary steam-engine . One of the oddest of his notions was a design for a model prison . In his enthusiasm for this device his habitual common sense deserted him . He foresaw morals reformed , health preserved , industry invigor-ated , instruction diffused , public burdens lightened , economy seated as it were upon a rock , the Gordian knot of the Poor Law not cut but untied ? all by a simple idea in architecture ' . The Panopticon , as the prison was called , must not be taken as typical either of the wisdom or of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an important aspect of them all . Its virtue resides in a commonplace material expedient , an idea in architecture ' . What a reassuring alternative to the proposals of the French and English Jacobins ' ! Bentham among the Jacobins ' is like an engineer in a community smitten by an epidemic , who , while one agitator recommends the overthrow of the government and another advocates a reform of the religion , quietly suggests a repair of the drains . Bentham 's message was in a sense uninspiring , but for that very reason it secured the confidence of a generation which had observed in France the appalling results of an overdose of political inspiration . // Bentham held that the aim of life is happiness . Here he was not far from Paley , who held that virtue is doing good .. . for the sake of everlasting happiness ' . The moral philosophy of the Archdeacon was in fact other-worldly Benthamism ' , and conversely Benthamism has been defined as Paley minus Hell-fire ' . This happiness-philosophy , utilitarianism as it was called , makes an immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common-sense ; if our aim in life is not happiness ' , what is it ? As a matter of fact utilitarianism is not only objectionable on moral grounds but also unsound as an intellectual system . If happiness , or pleasure ' , is the sole ultimate object of life , then one sort of happiness is as good as another . Bentham , who was fond of deriding what modern jargon calls ' high-brows ' , once said that if the amount of pleasure secured was equal , then push-pin was as good as poetry . We all know that many people get more pleasure from push-pin ' than from poetry , and we also firmly believe that it is not good to do so . We know that the happiness of a thoroughly selfish life is often equal in quantity and intensity to the happiness of an unselfish life , and we justify the latter by saying that it is a superior quality of happiness . But if there are higher ' and lower ' kinds of happiness , then there is a standard involved which is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goodness can not be explained simply as that which produces happiness . Thus to the sphere of pure thought Benthamism contributed nothing of any value . But Bentham was not primarily a philosopher , he was an exponent of practical legislative reforms , and in the sphere of practical legislation happiness ' is a good rough-and-ready test . We are often told that people can not be made good by Act of Parliament . That may or may not be true . There are also limits to the extent to which good laws can make them happy . But there are hardly any limits to the extent to which bad laws can make them unhappy , and here Bentham found the sphere of his LAISSEZ-FJ1IRE labours . He emphatically disagreed with the sentiment of Dr. Johnson 's couplet : Of all the ills that human hearts endure How small the part that laws can cause or cure . To the principle that legislation ought to aim at the greatest happiness of the greatest number Bentham added a second principle , much more disputable , that every man is the best judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be called laissez faire , i.e. , leave people free to act for themselves and they will act for the best . In the latter part of the nineteenth century , after the Benthamite movement had done its work and spent its force , laissez-faire became a term of abuse in the vocabulary of socialism . It indicated the refusal of government , from indifference or timidity , to intervene , in the cause of social justice , to protect the weak against the strong . Laissez-faire in fact came to be equivalent to the policy attributed to Lord Melbourne : Why not let it alone ? ' But for the early Benthamites laissez-faire was a war-cry  --   --  a call to strenuous political action . At every turn the laws of England placed obstacles in the way of the individual 's reasonable and profitable freedom of action . To Burke and Blackstone the laws of England were a garment which must be presumed to fit because it had so long and so becomingly been worn ; to Bentham they were a strait-waistcoat ' which hampered at every turn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their past history ; he asked only , what is their use to-day ? In a real sense Benthamism had begun before Bentham , when Adam Smith published his Wealth of Nations ( 1776 ) , and dismissed as injurious almost the whole of the system of elaborate regulation that centuries of commercial policy had built up for the supposed benefit of trade . Bentham held that every man was the best judge of his own happiness just as Smith held that every trader was the best judge of his own profit . He attacked all laws interfering with the free // expression of religious belief , or political opinion ; he attacked all laws that maintained the privileges of privileged classes , whether the privileges of the Church of England , or the political sinecures ( stoutly defended by Burke ) which constituted in fact a system of unemployment doles and old-age pensions for the rich and influential . He advocated the legalizing of trade unions , the abolition of the savage punishments of the criminal law , the reform of the parliamentary franchise and ? most important of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ? the reform of the actual procedure and methods of the courts of law . No one now reads his books , but he was one of those to whom might be applied the Latin tag , Si manumentum quaeris , circumspice . Practically all the legislative reforms of the middle period of the nineteenth century , a period of unprecedented activity in legislation , can be traced to his influence . Those reforms which ran counter to Benthamite doctrine , such as the Factory Acts , encountered a strenuous opposition , which would be inexplicable but for the fact that Bentham had convinced a whole generation of politicians that men ought to be left alone to pursue their own interests according to their own lights . The man himself was an amiable , unworldly , and unimpressive recluse . Though he despised poetry , which played tricks with the plain sense of words and substituted sentiment for argument , he delighted in music , in flowers , and in animal pets . Tame mice fed out of his hand , and a tame cat followed him about the roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the co-existence of cats and mice in the same establishment did not suggest to him one of the important limitations of the doctrine of laissez-faire . He knew little of the world of men , and imagined them to be much more reasonable than they really were ; the maxim that every society has the government it deserves was no part of his optimistic philosophy . He is described as boyish ' to the end of his days , and his philosophy , if unsweetened by sentiment , was richly seasoned with humour . His most notable // joke was the clause in his will directing that his body should be dissected in the presence of his friends and his skeleton presented to London University , where ( I hope ) it is still to be seen , seated in a chair , with a wax mask , and wearing Bentham 's wonted dress ' . Bentham rejected with scorn the doctrine of the immortality of the soul , but he could at least illustrate the utility of the skeleton . For long he worked with but little recognition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was only after the nineteenth century had opened that disciples , the first generation of the Benthamites , began to gather round him . The first and principal link between Bentham and the Benthamites was James Mill . James Mill was the son of a Scottish shoemaker . He availed himself to the full of the admirable educational ladder ' of his native country and , having reached the top of it , found , like other able and ambitious Scots , that the best thing in Scotland was the road to England. ! He wrote a remarkable History of India , which brought him employ-ment in the office of the East India Company . In charac-ter he was as unlike Bentham as possible . He was one of those Scots ( Carlyle was another ) who , while abandoning the religious doctrines of the Kirk , retained all its austere and narrow Puritanism . He regarded the production of pleasure as the exclusive test of right and wrong , but pleasure itself , said his son , he had scarcely any belief in . He was not insensible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth the price which , at least in the present state of society , must be paid for them . He thought human life a poor thing at best , after the freshness of youth and of unsatisfied curiosity had gone by . ' He combined in fact the Epicurean philosophy with the Stoic character ? not an impossible nor THE FIRST THIRD OF THE CENTURY an uncommon combination . Epicurus himself , the Greek exponent of the pleasure-philosophy , whose very name has given us , in epicure ' , an alternative term for gourmet , was by some accounts a teetotaller and a vegetarian who regarded cheese as one of the principal luxuries of diet . Political theorists who devote their lives to books , and rub shoulders but little with ordinary people , are very apt to imagine that ordinary people are more like political theorists than is in fact the case . James Mill seems to have fallen a victim to this error , and in a greater or less degree it is characteristic of all the early Benthamites . They believed that a wide extension of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would almost automatically produce legislative wisdom . Long afterwards James Mill 's son , John Stuart Mill , wrote : So complete was my father 's reliance on the influence of reason over the minds of mankind , whenever it is allowed to reach them , that he felt as if all would be gained if the whole population were to be taught to read , if all sorts of opinions were allowed to be addressed to them by word and in writing , and if by means of the suffrage they could nominate a legislature to give effect to the opinions they adopted . Accordingly a democratic suffrage was the principal article of his political creed , not on the grounds of liberty , rights of man , or any of the phrases , more or less significant , by which , up to that time , democracy had usually been defended , but as the most essential of securi-ties for good government . ' 1 To-day we find it very easy to criticize optimism of this kind . John Stuart Mill himself was , as we shall see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critics of this faith in the wisdom of the majority . Again , in a generation later than John Stuart Mill 's , modern psychology has taught us that reason plays but a small part in forming most people 's opinions and a still smaller part in deciding their conduct . To-day it is less necessary to criticize the faith of the early Benthamites in popular wisdom than to remind ourselves HENRY BROUGHAM that it was , after all , up to a point , entirely justified . The extension of the franchise and the development of free discussion , through education and cheap newspapers and books , did in fact promote an immense amount of indisputable legislative improvement . Among the Benthamites who were engaged in practical politics during the first third of the nineteenth century far the most conspicuous and many-sided was Henry Brougham , Cobbett 's Scotch feelosopher ' . He was not of the inner circle of the disciples , but for that reason he illustrates all the better the widely ramifying character of the Benthamite movement ; for though the central core of Benthamism was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was rapidly becoming , as the Tory domination drew to a close , the spirit of the new age . Brougham was born in Edinburgh in 1778 and from the age of twenty-four onwards contributed voluminously to the Edinburgh Review , founded by Sydney Smith and Jeffrey as an organ of political liberalism in the most general sense of the term . He wrote fluently on science , politics , literature , and the fine arts . Restless ambition carried him to London and he was called to the Bar in 18o8 . He entered the House of Commons in 181o , and rapidly became the most talkative as well as the most formidable member of the Opposition . He secured the abolition of the Orders in Council which , intended to injure Napoleon , more obviously injured British trade . He thrust himself to the forefront of the agitation which secured the abolition of the Income Tax on the close of the war . We will not pursue in detail his parliamentary activities ; suffice it to say that he took all law-reform as his province , delivering in 1828 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech of six hours duration on the subject . Canning once said of him : The honourable and learned gentleman having in the course of his parliamentary life supported or proposed almost every species of innovation which could be practised on the constitution , it was not very easy for members to do anything // without seeming to borrow from him . Break away in what direction they would , whether to the right or to the left , it was all alike . " Oh , " said the honourable gentleman , " I was there before you : you would not have thought of that if I had not given you the hint . " ' Brougham had all the qualifications of a political agitator ? a ready sympathy with every kind of grievance , unflagging industry , and an almost unparalleled capacity for the rapid assimilation and lucid exposition of complicated subjects . He had also another quality , for an account of which I will rely on the evidence of one who had often seen him in the flesh . There is a last quality ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language of books , but which Lord Brougham excels in , and which perhaps has been of more value to him than all his other qualities put together . In the speech of ordinary men it is called " devil " . What it is one can hardly express in a single sentence . It is most easily explained by physiognomy . There is a glare in some men 's eyes which seems to say , " Beware , I am dangerous ; noli me tangere . " Lord Brougham 's face has this . A mischievous excitability is the most obvious expression of it . If he were a horse , nobody would buy him ; with that eye , no one could answer for his temper . Such men are often not really resolute , but they are not pleasant to be near in a difficulty . They have an aggressive eagerness which is formidable . They would kick against the pricks sooner than not kick at all . A little of the demon is excellent for an agitator . ' ' It was characteristically Benthamic in Brougham that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the leading spirits in the movement which established the unsectarian or godless ' University College in London . He promoted Mechanics ' Institutes for working men , and founded the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge , writing its first pamphlet on The Pleasures and Advantages of Science . It was here most particularly that Cobbett fell foul of him . HENRY BROUGHAM Brougham believed intensely in all that the Industrial Revolution stood for . He thought that working men only needed to be intellectually convinced of its benefits and they would become the docile agents of the new capitalism . They would learn the truths of political economy , and cease to kick against the iron pricks of the laws of supply and demand . Cobbett warned the members of the London Mechanics ' Institute ? If you suffer yourselves to be put into the crucibles of Scotch " feelosophers " , you will make but a poor figure when you come out . ' But Brougham expected from popular education even greater things than industrial docility . He expected what Americans now call the outlawry of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' said Brougham in 1828 ; he can do nothing in this age . There is another personage , a personage less imposing in the eyes of some , perhaps insignificant . The schoolmaster is abroad , and I trust him , armed with his primer , against the soldier in full military array . ' Exactly a hundred years have passed since these words were spoken , and now that we know the schoolmaster better we have moderated our expectations of him . We have discovered that the teaching of schoolmasters is likely to reflect rather than to correct the shortcomings of the society to which they belong . After all , they are but men . By 1830 , when the Whigs took office , Brougham had secured an extraordinary reputation . He was absolutely indispensable to the new Government , but they distrusted him . Lord Althorp , who was to lead the Commons , refused to have him as a fellow-minister in the same House , so he was sent to the Lords as Lord Chancellor . If only he knew a little law , ' said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' His fame was that of an agitator ; men doubted , said Bagehot , if he would sit still on the Woolsack. ' 1 In fact the fruitful part of his career was nearly over . Lord 1 In actual fact , he used to spit from the Woolsack upon the carpet of the House of Lords . This was , no doubt , a less remarkable performance in 1830 than it would be to-day : but it was not altogether liked . 5 I THE FIRST THIRD OF THE CENTURY Brougham and Vaux , to give him his new title , played an active part in pushing his colleagues through the prolonged crises of the Reform Bill , but after that it was , as a wit said , Vaux et praeterea nihil ' . Melbourne got rid of him in 1834i and the long remainder of his career was an anticlimax marred by deplorable eccentricities . One of his eccentricities was to announce his own death in order to read his own obituary notices . But the later career of Lord Brougham , whether we regard it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with the development of the Benthamite movement . The Benthamites were ardent reformers , but their philosophy of reform , if judged by any modern standard , was confined within somewhat narrow limits . It excluded practically everything which passes under the title of social reform to-day . Indeed , on social questions the Benthamites were generally found , as the century advanced , to be the allies of the old propertied classes , and as such they became the butt of the social reformers of the Victorian epoch , as will appear in the next chapter . If the Tories believed in the defence of property the Benthamites believed in the freedom of competition , and from the standpoint of the reformer who desired the State to step in and improve the position of the poor , if necessary at the expense of the rich , the Benthamite was as bad as the Tory . Perhaps he was worse , for he defended his opposition to social reform with more plausible arguments . The negative aspects of Benthamism are imposingly displayed in the work of the classical school ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Adam Smith and not in Bentham , for Bentham was no economist . But James Mill was an economist as well as a Benthamite , and the classical economic doctrines may be regarded as a specialized and technical application of the Benthamite principle of individualism or laissez-faire . Specialized and technical studies are necessarily outside the scope of this book , and it is impossible to give more than a brief and very inade- // quate idea of the work of the economists . What follows will , however , suffice to demonstrate the limitations of laissez-faire as a principle of reform . Adam Smith was a professor of moral philosophy in the University of Glasgow , who was attracted to economic studies by his intercourse with the merchants of that rapidly developing city . When the Act of Union with Scotland first threw open to Scotsmen the trade of the English colonies Glasgow was no more than a village ; by the end of the century it was on its way to becoming what it now is , the second largest city in Great Britain . Smith 's Wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also a very miscellaneous book . Much of it is exceedingly practical and concrete , the work of an observer of facts , a student of history . But if Smith enjoyed the talk of merchants he was also , by profession , a philosopher . His work is a mixture of induction and deduction . He is inductive when he is basing conclusions upon the facts of his observation ; he is deductive when his conclusions come to him from the axioms of his philosophy . Of these axioms the most important is that Nature has made provision for social well-being by arranging that every man shall seek to better his own condition . The individual aims only at his private gain , but is led by an invisible hand ' to promote the public good . State-made laws , by interfering with this principle in the name of public interest , defeat their own end ; when restraints of trade are taken away the obvious and simple system of natural liberty establishes itself of its own accord ' . Smith was the author , so far as British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The practical side of his mind suggested many objections and limitations to the application of the theory , and if he had returned to life in the middle of the nineteenth century , he would have viewed the completeness of the triumph of his theory with astonishment and possibly with disapproval . Economic science , however , was to develop , for the next seventy years , along abstract and deductive rather than along practical and inductive lines . That was the golden age of // the now discredited , perhaps unduly discredited , classical ' economists . Seventy years after the publication of The Wealth of Nations , John Stuart Mill published ( 1847 ) his Principles of Political Economy ) . That book , though pro-fessedly a treatise of the classical school , marks the beginning of a return to the concrete and the practical . Henceforth economists would not be content to simplify their problems by assuming the existence of a society of economic men ' led by invisible hands ' ; they would attempt to grapple with the complexities of human society as it exists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mathematical demonstrations . They would realize that their studies were a department of politics rather than an abstract science . At the same time , it would be a great mistake to suppose that the ingenious analyses of the classical economists were so much labour wasted . They were , along their own lines , genuine men of science , and the history of all the sciences shows that research is not wasted even when it has led a particular researcher to a wrong conclusion . All the econo-mic schools of a later day have made use of the work of the classical school . Of the many acute and pertinacious theorists who devoted their energies to economic theory in the first thirty years of the nineteenth century , the best remembered to-day is David Ricardo . He was a Jew by birth and a stockbroker by profession . His best work was done in connexion with problems of currency , banking , and taxation , where an understanding of social conditions is not , perhaps , of primary importance . His principal contribution , however , to the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wages , he seemed to have proved , were determined mechanically and inevitably by laws of supply and demand . All attempts , by philanthropic or revolutionary agitation , to raise the standard of wages were bound to fail , and , by dislocating trade , to leave things worse than before . There is a wages THE ECONOMISTS fund ' . Nothing can add to it . It can only be divided , and the more the competitors for it , the smaller will be the shares . The wages fund ' theory was not abandoned by a professional and accepted economist until 1869 , by John Stuart Mill in a revised edition of his Principles . The actual fact , of course , is that there is no such limited fund ' . Human ingenuity and industry can increase the production of wealth , and its distribution is governed by no such iron laws as those formulated by the deductive reasoning of the classical economists . The reputation of the classical economists has suffered from the fact that their works were extremely hard to understand , and few made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quoted , out of their context , to justify all kinds of absurd or immoral purposes . In the same way , fragments of economic argument from Smith , Ricardo , and others were taken out of their context by hasty and prejudiced politicians , and used to justify , in the House of Commons , policies which the economists themselves would have derided and condemned . A notion arose that the economists were worshippers of Mammon , and hired scribes of the rich . On the contrary , many of them were humane and kindly persons who supported , in their non-professional capacity , the very reforms which their writings were supposed to condemn . The Scotsman McCulloch seems to have been popularly regarded as a particularly pitiless economist , on the strength of his professional works , yet he was very ready to support Lord Shaftesbury in his agitation to secure a legal interference with economic laws ' in the interests of women and children in factories . None the less the fact remains that the work of the classical economists reached the general public and the ordinary politician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It discouraged social reform , for social reform could always be represented as interference with economic liberty ; and to a generation which was achieving religious liberty by the abolition of tests , and politi- // cal liberty by the extension of the suffrage , economic liberty appeared to be equally desirable . It would be hard to say whether public opinion is more influenced by books or by newspapers . Indeed the question is an unprofitable one , for much of the influence of books upon public opinion is indirect and comes through the channel of newspapers . For journalists have little time to think , and are therefore the retailers of the thought of others . The foundation of our modern Press was the discovery that newspapers could sell their space for purposes of advertisement . Newspaper advertising began in about 177o , and from that date onwards the future of newspapers was assured . The French Revolution and Napoleon furnished , for over twenty years , a continuous supply of interesting news . Interesting news multiplies readers , and increased circulation means increased power and independence . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government in return for a pension of ? 600 . His successor in 1815 would have laughed at such a proposal , not because he was more virtuous but because he had acquired larger ideas . The Prime Minister , Lord Liverpool , discussed the changed conditions somewhat peevishly with his colleague , Lord Castlereagh . No paper of any character , and consequently an established sale ' , he writes , will accept money from Government ; and indeed their profits are so enormous in all critical times , when their support is the most necessary , that no pecuniary assistance that Government can offer would really be worth their acceptance . The truth is they look only to their sale . They make their way like sycophants with the public , by finding out the prejudices and prepossessions of the moment and flattering them ; and the number of soi-disant Government or Opposition papers abound just as the Government is generally popular or unpopular . ' It is not difficult to construct from these sentences the old Tory idea of the functions and duties of the Press . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the Government , and for obvious reasons . The Government // depended on the votes of the House of Commons , and nearly half the members of that House were nominated by controllers of rotten-boroughs . The Press depended on its circulation . Moreover it is always easier to make effective popular journalism on the Opposition side . John Morley , who edited a daily paper in mid-Victorian days , once asked a young journalist what was his speciality , and he replied , Invective ' . There are many such journalists , and their talents rust unused if they are employed in defending the established order and the established government . Newspapers had been taxed since Queen Anne 's reign , and in 1$15 the tax stood at fourpence a copy , the normal price of a newspaper being sevenpence . The original purpose of the tax was revenue , but there is no doubt that the Tory Government regarded the tax also as a measure of self-protection . It helped to keep newspapers accounted seditious out of the hands of the working classes . Cobbett 's Political Register @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which escaped the tax because it was not technically a newspaper . Twopenny Trash ' , as the untaxed edition was called , was a commentary on news no longer new , like our present-day political weeklies ' . Others carried on a subterraneous and illegal existence . In the panic that followed the Peterloo meeting the Government carried an Act , one of the so-called Six Acts , imposing a small tax on political pamphlets . Twopenny Trash ' came within the ambit of the new tax , and paid it , though the full story of the relations between Cobbett 's cheap edition and the revenue officers is too complicated to be followed out here . The newspaper tax , and the Government 's imperfect success in enforcing the payment of it , form part of the warfare between Government and Press to which we have referred in connexion with Cobbett . The Press was bound to win . Among the factors on its side was the progress of mechanical invention .

The Edinburgh claimed to stand for progressive ideas , but it was not at all advanced or revolutionary . It derided Bentham even though it popularized many of his policies . Of the early Edinburgh Reviewers two , Sydney Smith and Brougham , have already been described . The editor from almost the beginning until 1829 was Francis Jeffrey , a lawyer and a very amiable man who took literature as his especial province . Unfortunately he is remembered now only for the superficiality of his judgements . He opened a review of Wordsworth 's Excursion with the words This will never do ' , and declared that of all the poets of his day only Campbell and Rogers were secure of immortality .

It is perhaps a mark of the speeding-up of modern life that , by the middle of the century , the Quarterlies found that much of the influence they had enjoyed was passing to the Monthly magazines , of which the Tory Blackwood 's ( 1817 ) was one of the earliest . Long before the end of the century Weeklies such as The Spectator and The Saturday Review were passing the Monthlies as the Monthlies had passed the Quarterlies. 59 IV FIVE POETS THE brief period that began in 1798 with the publication of Lyrical Ballads by Wordsworth and Coleridge , and ended with the deaths , in rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1821-24 ) , produced more , far more , great lyrical and reflective poetry than any other period of equal length in the history of English literature . Poetry , for poetry 's sake , is not the subject of this book , and of one of these poets , Keats , we shall have nothing to say ; for Keats 's quest was beauty in itself and for its own . sake , and his poetry was not concerned with thought or opinion . But three of them , Wordsworth , Byron and Shelley , had a message to the world , and their poetry is the vehicle of that message , though it is also , of course , being poetry , something more than that . Coleridge conveyed but little message in his poetry , but after he had ceased to be a poet he became a preacher or prophet , and the burden of his preaching had a quality at once visionary and inspiring , such as only one who had been a poet would have achieved . And it will be convenient to add another poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laureate , Robert Southey . He also had something to say , and it is perhaps well that he said it in prose . All these poets , together with other poets and prosewriters , English , French , German , and Italian , not to mention artists , architects and musicians , have been grouped together in the tradition of criticism and treated as exponents of the Romantic Movement . The Romantic Movement 6o THE ROMANTIC MOVEMENT is a topic on which so much has been written that one hesitates to add even a paragraph to the vast literature of the subject . None the less it is necessary to do so . I believe that the fundamental impulse of the Romantic Movement ca.n be found in a very simple phrase ? the Call of the Wild ' . Throughout by far the greater part of the history of the human race life was rough , casual , disorderly , and adventurous , near to Nature ' as we say . In very recent times , comparatively speaking , law and order were achieved . Now law and order , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been ) , impose tiresome fetters upon the spontaneous impulses of the individual . Moreover , what our ancestors have achieved we take for granted . We forget how great an achievement it was , what an improveinent it marked on what had gone before it . Rousseau was the first great prophet of the Romantic Movement , and his books ( which were written in the middle of the eighteenth century ) are continually contrasting . civilization with ' Nature ' , to the great disadvantage of the former . Rousseau was , incidentally , very keenly alive to the beauty of wild scenery , to Nature in the visual sense , but the Nature ' of his political treatises is a kind of Garden of Eden , out of which Man has mistakenly strayed , and to which he must at all costs find his way back . The reason why the French Revolution was something more than a mere ephemeral political storm in a French tea-cup was that it was an exposition in political terms of the Romantic Movement , a quest after some mysterious Rights of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the cunning schemers who entrapped him into civilization . Of course Rousseau and his disciples did not want to return to barbarism ; they wanted , one may say , both to eat their cake and to have it . If Rousseau could have seen the result of the French Revolution he would certainly have condemned it . In fact the Romantic movement was bound to miss its ideal lit politics , however valuable its political by-products . So it passed over into poetry , art , and music , and inspired the wild dreams of 6z THE FIRST THIRD OF THE CENTURY Shelley , the sunsets of Turner and the solemn splendours of the later works of Beethoven . Wordsworth was born and grew up in the English Lake country , the most sensationally beautiful region of England , its beauty then unravaged by the amenities of holiday tourists . In those early days , he tells us , the sounding cataract Haunted me like a passion ; the tall rock , The mountain , and the deep and gloomy wood , Their colours and their forms , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love , That had no need of a remoter charm . Visiting France in 1791 in order to learn French , he was intoxicated by the French Revolution , and only financial pressure exerted from home prevented him from throwing in his lot with the Girondin party . He returned to England , and the later course of the Revolution , culminating in the aggressive military tyranny of Napoleon , completely disillusioned him . He had worshipped Nature as a source of almost sensual intoxication : he had worshipped her as a symbol of political revolution . The first was inadequate , the second utterly mistaken . ' Nature was neither a picture book nor a political will-of-the-wisp . She was the mother of Man and his true home . She was around him and within him . The secret of life was to live in communion with Nature . From Nature alone can Man win for himself that blessed mood , In which the burthen of the mystery , In which the heavy and the weary weight Of all this unintelligible world Is lightened . It was only after reaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write great poetry . There is danger of paradox and absurdity in comparing Wordsworth and Cobbett , in comparing the quietest of the greater poets with the noisiest and most pugnacious of journalists . But Wordsworth 's philosophy is at this point the spiritual equiva- // lent of Cobbettism . Cobbett stood for the country against the town as the sound and wholesome basis of workaday life . Wordsworth stood for the country against the town because , as some one said , God made the country and man made the town . Cobbett 's country , it is tr11e , is the culti-vated farm land ; Wordsworth 's is the waste and the moun-tain . But both were utterly out of sympathy with the progress ' of the new industrialism . Leslie Stephen offers an ingenious explanation of the fact that love of the sublimest scenery should be associated with a profound conviction that all things are out of joint . After all , it is not surprising that those who are most sick of man as he is should love the regions where man seems smallest . When Swift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed how absurd our passions appear in a creature six inches high : and the mountains make us all Lilliputians. ' 1 Love of Nature ? love of home ? love of country . In the series of political sonnets , begun in 1802 in conscious revival of the Miltonic tradition , Wordsworth gave the noblest poetic expression to English patriotism . In a prose pamphlet entitled Tract on the Convention of Cintra ( an incident of the Peninsular War ) he looks further afield and argues that Napoleon can only be beaten by arousing the dormant national spirit of the conquered peoples of his empire . He asserts the moral basis of nationalism as in accord with Nature , and in fact anticipates the doctrines associated with Mazzini , the prophet of Italian unity.2 Wordsworth lived to a great age , and when he died , in the middle year of the nineteenth century , he had long survived his own genius . But from the nature of his genius it was inevitable that he should grow more and more con-servative as he grew older . He ends in mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and doubting , like a Tory extremist , whether popular education will THE FIRST THIRD OF THE CENTURY not do more harm than good . Can it in a general view be good that the infant should learn much which its parents do not know ? ' He was one of those who , as Hazlitt said , missed the road to Utopia , and alighted upon it in Old Sarum . Having preached in the season of his genius the virtual identity of God and Nature , he withdrew within the fortress of the Church of England and dedicated to it a long series of Ecclesiastical Sonnets . He stopped short , however , of forming the habit of going to Church . He was of the school that have been called not pillars but flying buttresses of the edifice . But the Wordsworth whose influence grew as the century advanced was the Wordsworth of the prime . That influence was far too profound to be summarized adequately by me in a few trivial sentences . He has been the favourite English poet of many of the best and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matthew Arnold to Lord Grey of Fallodon . He gave not the first , but the deepest expression to that love of the wholesome quiet of the countryside which grows upon us more and more as life becomes more and more urbanized . A French critic of the English novelists has remarked on the pervasive influence of fresh air ' in modern English poetry and fiction . He points out how many of the greatest scenes in our classic ' Victorian novels are staged out of doors , and finds no parallel to this in the literature of his own country . The peasants of Thomas Hardy 's Wessex novels have their forerunners in Wordsworth 's Michael arid Matthew . Samuel Taylor Coleridge was the son of a Devonshire clergyman , but he was educated at Christ 's Hospital in London , and he was all his life , what Wordsworth never was , a man of books ; Wordsworth learnt his wisdom on mountains , Coleridge in libraries . He is commonly classed with Wordsworth as a Lake poet ' , but he lived only a short time in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early manhood is tarred with the revolutionary // brush , for he planned , with his brother-in-law Southey , to found an ideal Pantisocratic ( all-equal ) community in the United States . It need hardly be said that nothing came of this guileless aspiration . In 1798 he visited Germany and drank deep of the new German philosophy ; as one of the first to introduce the conceptions of this philosophy to England he was a forerunner of the Oxford school of philosophy , which we shall meet in a later chapter . The season of his poetic genius was brilliant but brief and early over , and his poetry hardly comes within the sphere of our subject . His best poems belong to the realm of pure unfettered imagination , though it would be just possible , on the strength of its final stanzas , to connect The . lncient Mariner with the humanitarian movement . In the first years of the nineteenth century he became a slave to opium , emerging , after many years of indulgence and misery , under the care of Dr. Gilman , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his death in 1834 . At Highgate the last phase of his life begins . He was no longer a poet but a sage , surrounded by a group of earnest disciples , eager to discover the secrets of his cloudy and incoherent philosophy . Carlyle wrote a biography of John Sterling , one of these disciples , and it contains a chapter from which few writers on Coleridge have resisted the temptation to quote . The chapter , however , should be ' read in its entirety . The quotation that follows is made up of passages from various parts of it . Coleridge sat on the brow of Highgate Hill in those years , looking down on London and its smoke-tumult , like a sage escaped from the inanity of life 's battle ; attracting towards him the thoughts of innumerable brave souls still engaged there . A sublime man ; who , alone in those dark days , had saved his crown of spiritual manhood ; escaping from the black materialisms and revolutionary deluges , with " God , Freedom , and Immortality " still his ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than his talk . Besides , it was talk not flowing anywhither like a river , but spreading everywhither in inextricable currents and regurgitations like a lake or sea ; terribly deficient in goal or aim , very often in logical intelligibility ; what you were to believe or do , on any earthly or heavenly thing , obstinately refusing to appear from it . So that , most times , you felt logically lost ; swamped near to drowning in this tide of ingenious vocables , spreading out boundless as if to submerge the world . The constant gist of his discourse was lamentation over the sunk condition of the world : which he recognized to be given up to Atheism and Materialism , full of sordid misbeliefs , mispursuits and misresults . The remedy , though Coleridge himself professed to see it as in sunbeams , could not , except by processes unspeakably difficult , be described to you at all . On the whole , those dead Churches , this dead English Church especially , must be brought to life again . Why not ? It was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , was tragically asleep only . Atheistic philosophy was true on its own side ; but lift the Church and it into a higher sphere of argument , it died into inanition , the Church revivified itself into its pristine florid vigour . But how , but how ! By attending to the " reason " of man , said Coleridge , and duly chaining-up the " understanding " of man : the Vernunft ( Reason ) and Verstand ( Understanding ) of the Germans , it all turned upon these , if you could well understand them ? which you could n't . ' This is ironical and depreciatory , as is Carlyle 's way . None the less , Coleridge 's theory of the Church was one which , though fantastic in the form in which he stated it , had a real significance and a real influence upon the thought of the next generation . The National Church , he held , had been diverted from its proper function . In the Middle Ages it had been an endowment for the promotion of civilization in all its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual life of man and not merely a particular variety of religion in the narrower sense . The Church // must once again be made truly national , and its energies lifted above the sectarian channels into which they had narrowed since the Reformation . Here , be it observed , is the Romantic movement finding its goal not in the mountains , nor in Utopia , nor in Old Sarum , but in an idealized Middle Ages . The goals lie bewilderingly far apart , but they have this in common , that they are all remote from modern industrial society . And what of the objection , frankly admitted by Coleridge , that much of what passed for the orthodox teaching of religion has been rendered incredible by anti-Christian critics of the school of Voltaire ? His answer is that much which seems incredible to the mere understanding ' will be justified by reason ' . These terms proved a stumblingblock to Carlyle , and in fact do violence to the ordinary meanings of the words . By reason ' Coleridge means very much what we call intuition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we call reason . It is a commonplace to anyone who has thought about the matter , that the fundamental assertions of religion , the existence of God , for example , are not capable of proof , as proof is understood in science . None the less many of the wisest and greatest are still convinced that God exists ; they would say that their conviction of it is firmer and stronger than any merely rational ' argument could make it . The strength of religion is not based on rational but on superrational grounds . Coleridge both claimed to be , and was , a Christian , but many of his contemporaries would not have admitted his claim , for his views were alarmingly liberal . He was , it appears , the first to use the word bibliolairy to denote a superstitious belief in the verbal infallibility of the Bible . Bibliolatry , he held , was the worst enemy of the Christian religion . The whole of the Broad Church school of the next generation , in all its varieties , is derivable from Coleridge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him was written by John Stuart Mill . Mill was // the son of James Mill and he had been brought up in accord-ance with the straitest sect of the atheistical Benthamites , who held that reason , and reason alone , sufficed . Yet Mill found as he grew older that Benthamism , though true as far as it went , was a painfully incomplete philosophy of life . He speaks of Bentham and Coleridge 1 as the two seminal minds of the age ' , and though he professes himself still a Benthamite , it is plain that he realized that Coleridge , however vague and unpractical his programme , reached a deeper stratum of truth than the triumphantly rational exponent of the greatest happiness ' theory , whose legislative expedients were being added almost annually to the Statute book . Robert Southey was the intimate associate of Wordsworth and Coleridge and he was also , as they assuredly were not , a somewhat ordinary man , an industrious and capable man of letters , a model of all the domestic virtues , the author of many long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nelson which is recognized as an excellent specimen of its own type of composition . We find him starting life full of revolutionary ardour , like Wordsworth and Coleridge . While an undergraduate he wrote a play , Wat Tyler , glorifying rebellion , a play which was discovered and rather unkindly published by his enemies long after-wards . By 1809 , however , he had so far passed over into the opposite camp as to be one of the founders of the Quarterly Review , and in 1813 he became Poet Laureate . His Ode on the Death of George III was the subject of a savage attack from Byron , who composed an alternative Vision of judgement which is probably the most blasphemous poem of any real merit in our literature . The outlook of the ageing Wordsworth was mere nega-tion . He withdrew into his mountains and shook the SOUTHEY AND BYRON dust of the progressive plains off his feet . One of his last sonnets is a protest against the building of the Kendal and Windermere railway . Coleridge developed an original philosophy which might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Benthamism , but was very far from being the Toryism of the Tory party . Coleridge in fact described the Tory party as a cyclops with one eye , and that in the back of the head ' . Southey was neither ' a recluse nor a philosopher . He was a practical and publicspirited man , and he found his harbour in the Evangelical philanthropic party . He combined an entire disregard for liberty , applauding the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act in 1817 , with an active support of every movement for the relief of human suffering . He interested himself particularly in Lord Ashley 's agitation on behalf of child labour in the factories , a subject which belongs to our next ' chapter . Wordsworth , Coleridge , and Southey were born in the early ' seventies of the eighteenth century . They watched the French Revolution from start to finish and their early enthusiasm for it was extinguished by what they read in their newspapers . Byron and Shelley were born twenty years later . For them the Reign of Terror was an event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , discrediting not at all the essential gospel of the revolutionists . They died young , revolutionists of a sort to the last . Byron was by far the most popular poet of his own day , and he enjoyed an immediate fame on the Continent such as has never before or since fallen to an English poet . Something of his vogue may have been due to extraneous circumstances , his noble birth , , the notorious scandals of his private life , and his heroic and sensational death as a warrior in the earliest of the crusades of nineteenth-century nationalism . But in the main his poetry was popular because it had popular qualities ; it was at once dashing and slipshod , easy and exciting , melodious and romantic . Byron holds , like all the revolutionists , that Man , that non-existent 69 6 THE FIRST THIRD OF THE CENTURY abstraction , is naturally good , and that Society and Civiliza-tion are the villains of the piece . His heroes are criminals , but their crimes are their misfortunes , for which Society must bear the guilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sixth Commandment , and Don Juan who held the record as a breaker of the Seventh . Byron has all the aristocrat 's contempt for comfortable middle-class respect-ability . He must be one of the earliest writers to poke fun at the London suburbs . Don Juan approaches London Through Groves , so called from being void of trees , ( Like luau from no light ) ; through prospects named Mount Pleasant , as containing nought to please , Nor much to climb ; through little boxes framed Of bricks to let the dust in at your ease , With To be Let ' upon their doors proclaimed ; Through Rows most modestly called Paradise Which Eve might quit without much sacrifice . Byron despised these things as an aristocrat despises them . But there is a large class below , as well as a small class above , the bourgeoisie , and Byron 's romantic contempt for everything that could be called smug , struck a chord in the hearts of the men who read Tom Paine in garrets , planned the pitifully ineffective riots and demonstrations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English revolution which would be so much better than the French . It was known that Byron 's first speech in the House of Lords had been a defiant defence of the Luddite rioters . Tory periodicals like Blackwood 's talked of Benthamites and Byronites ' as if they were much of a muchness . It is difficult to imagine two things more different than Ben-thamism and Byronism , yet both were unsettling the fourrda-tions of the Old Toryism , and Byron supplied an element that certainly could not have come from Bentham . He made discontent romantic . The mobs that frightened the politicians of both parties in the year of the Reform Bill certainly contained more readers of Byron than of Bentham . Byron was a man very well acquainted with the world , 70 the flesh and the devil ; he was a great satirist , but he was not a great poet . There is more petulance than programme about his revolutionary eloquence . He rails at kings , but after the death of George IV the sovereign ceased to be a bugbear of the dissatisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the opinion of Matthew Arnold , who disliked his poetry , an angel ' even though a beautiful and ineffectual angel ' . Moreover , he was a really great poet , and a poet who has inspired enthusiasm even more than possibly greater poets . His vogue has steadily grown , and though it is easy to admire his poetry and ignore his philosophy , it is quite certain that his philosophy has coloured the outlook of life of many people , particularly young people , who have delighted in his poetry . Shelley 's philosophy is pure revolt , unqualified by a single saving clause of common-sense . He took up the dry bones of Godwinism and with them fashioned a figure of Man triumphant over God and over civilization as we know it . Kings , priests and statesmen blast the human flower Even in its tender bud . Away with them ! Religion is a prolific fiend ' . The hero of his greatest work is Prometheus , the champion of Man against the Gods . In fact Shelley is an inspired child crying for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metaphor , we may borrow one from Emerson and say that he hitched his waggon to a star ' . In the last year of his life he beguiled himself with the hope that the Greek insurrection was the beginning of the New World . The world 's Great Age begins anew , The mighty months return ; The earth doth like a snake renew Its winter weeds outworn . And yet he knew that it was not so : Oh cease ! must hate and death return ? Cease ! must men kill and die ? 7a THE FIRST THIRD OF THE CENTURY In the striking paragraph which opens his little book on She1L7 , Godwin , and their Circle , Mr. Brailsford writes : The history of the French Revolution in England begins with a sermon and ends with a poem . Between the famous discourse of Dr. Richard Price on the love of our country , delivered in the first excitement that followed the fall of the Bastille , and the publication of Shelley 's Hellas there stretched a period of thirty-two years . It covered the dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope . It begins with the grave but enthusiastic prose 3f a divine justly respected by earnest men who with a limited horizon fulfilled their daily duties in the City . It ends with the rapt vision , the magical music of a singer , who seemed as he sang to soar beyond the range of human ears . The hope passes from the confident expectation of instant change , through the sobrieties of disillusionment and the recantations of despair , to the iridescent dreams of a future which has taken wing and made its home in a fairy world . ' And yet not altogether in a fairy world , for Shelley has become one of the patron saints of Socialism . Socialism , like Shelley 's dream , is based on a conviction of the natural goodness of man and the badness of the institutions with which he has none the less managed to provide himself . // THE MIDDLE THIRD OF THE CENTURY I THE BENTHAMITE-LIBERAL ORTHODOXY WE took as our starting-point in the first chapter the fact that the Old Tory party controlled the government of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to 1830 . The verdicts of general elections and of votes in the House of Commons give no such clear indication in the period that lies before us , roughly definable as 1830-1874 . Governments labelled Whig and Tory alternate , the Whig Governments lasting on the average three times as long as the Tory Governments . We might therefore conclude that English political opinion in the Early and Mid-Victorian periods was three-parts Whig and one-part Tory , ? a simple and uninstructive conclusion , for what in the period was the meaning of Whiggery and what the meaning of Toryism ? The fact of the matter is that the old party labels had less significance in this period than in any period before or after . In 1832 , no doubt , Whigs and Tories fought on the clear issue of the Reform Bill ; should the historic and picturesque anomalies of the ancient rotten-borough ' system be preserved , or should they be abolished in favour of a rigid middle-class franchise ? But the Reform Bill , once passed , was recognized by its opponents as irrevocable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party // delivered itself over to the leadership of the son of a Lancashire manufacturer , Sir Robert Peel , and Peel was so little enamoured of Tory traditions that he made a point of emphasizing the new name which some were applying to the Tory party . The name Conservative ' , originally borrowed ( like its companion Liberal ' ) from the political vocabulary of France , was used at the time of the Reform Bill struggle as a synonym for Tory . After the Reform Bill had become law , Peel was careful to draw a distinction . Conservatism ' accepted the new franchise and would do its best to falsify the gloomy prediction of Old Toryism . It would conserve our institutions by submitting them to careful and judicious but , where necessary , thorough reform . The classic criticism of Peel 's Conservative policy was to come , in the ' forties , from Disraeli . It was , he says , an attempt to construct a party without principles . What will you conserve ? The prerogatives of the Crown , provided they are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided it is not asserted ; the Ecclesiastical estate , provided it is regulated by a commission of laymen . ' In fact , an organized hypocrisy ' . Or again , one may quote from Coningsby , published in 1844 , a fragment of dialogue between characters who are meant to typify the political hacks of the party . " That we should ever live to see a Tory government again ! " said Mr. Taper . " We have reason to be very thankful . " " Hush ! " said Mr. Tadpole . " The time has gone by for Tory governments ; what the country requires is a sound Conservative government . " " A sound Conservative government , " said Taper , musingly . " I understand : Tory men and Whig measures . " ' This seems very ' crushing , but it really only means that Peel was prepared to read and to follow the signs of the times ; and that the Whig party were prepared to do exactly the same . // One man , and one man alone , enjoyed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles of Old Toryism from their natural stronghold , the House of Lcrds . This was , of course , the Duke of Wellington whose personal opinions in 1830 have already been quoted ( see p. 7 ) . Had Wellington attempted to rally to his leadership the scattered but still formidable remnants of the Old Tory party it is impossible to say how our political history would have developed . He deliberately refrained from doing so . Henceforth his motto was : The King 's ( and subsequently , the Queen 's ) government must be carried on . ' Again and again he threw the full weight of his authority on to the side of measures he personally detested and was known to detest . He remained at heart an Old Tory . He never became a Conservative , for he was , after 1832 , a political pessimist , whereas the essence of Peel 's creed was political optimism . He supported successive instalments of progress ' , not because he thought them progress ' but because he preferred them to revolution . Finally he came to regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique , non-party , institution . I am ' , he wrote in 1846 , the servant of the Crown and the people . I have been paid and rewarded , and consider myself retained . . . . I might with consistency have declined to belong to Sir Robert Peel 's Cabinet ' ( i.e. , the Cabinet that introduced and carried the repeal of the Corn Law ) . But my opinion is , that if I had , Sir Robert Peel 's Government would not have been framed ; that we should have had and in office next morning . ' There were , of course , Old Tories who would have nothing to do with Conservatism . John Wilson Croker refused to tarnish the escutcheon of his political consistency by standing for election to the reformed House of Commons . I for one ' , he wrote , believe that this day twelve months I shall be either in my grave or in the workhouse , and hope it may be the former . ' And there tame a time when Peel 's adaptability to new policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party might change its name. , but it was still the party of the country gentlemen , and it revolted when Peel , the manufacturer 's son , adopted the manufacturer 's policy of free trade in corn . In 1846 Peel and his personal following , the Peelites , were driven from the Tory-Conservative party . The Peelites , among whom was Gladstone , drifted across to the Whigs , and strengthened the Liberal element in that party . For Liberalism , after all , meant much the same as Conservatism . The Tory party , purged of Peelism , reluctantly accepted the leadership of Disraeli ; but it is to be noted that this party never enjoyed a majority in the House of Commons during the period covered by this chapter . Between 1 846 and 1874 the Tory-Conservative party ( distinction of terms again becoming meaningless ) enjoyed three brief spells of office , but on each occasion it was a minority government , like the Labour Government of 1924 . It could enact only such measures as secured support outside the party ranks . Moreover , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original excuse for its existence . Disraelian Toryism did not enjoy power as well as office until 1874 . Thus throughout our period the Tory party had ceased to be recognizably Tory . It may also be maintained that the Whig party ceased to be recognizably Whig . The Tory party was , by origin , the party dedicated to the maintenance of the authority of the Crown and the Church . The Whig party had been , essentially , the party of the great landed aristocracy , and Whig governments down to the middle of the nineteenth century were much less ready than Tory governments to find room in high office for men of ability who lacked both rank and inherited wealth . The Whig party had originated as the opposition to the Stuarts ; it had been mainly responsible for transferring the crown first to William III and afterwards to George I ; and its palmiest days had been the age of Walpole and the Duke of Newcastle , when , under foreign puppet- // kings , the great nobles had ruled England through a House of Commons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Whig faith in the rotten-borough system began to waver when George III showed that it could be used to advance the control of the king as easily as the control of the aristocracy over the nominally elected House . But the French Revolution nipped in the bud the democratic tendencies which the party had manifested in the days of Wilkes and Liberty ' . A large section of the party had followed Burke into the Tory camp , for Burke , the oracle of the Old Toryism in its fight with the French Revolution , had been the oracle of the Whigs when the enemy was the rebel colonists in America.i The Whig party was reduced to a mere shadow of its former self throughout the Napoleonic wars . It was an aristocratic coterie cherishing democrat and even republican senti-ments , but its sentiments often seemed more of a pose than a policy . It revered the memory of that most erratic and inconsequent of political gamblers , Charles James Fox , but it was impossible to discover an aristocrat of Fox 's vital energy and brilliant gifts among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French wars . None the less , as the years passed after Waterloo , as peace failed to entail prosperity , , and the Tory Government revealed its inability to discover any remedies for the notorious evils of that age of social and economic revolution , the prospects of the Whig party brightened almost in spite of the performances of the Whig leaders . These leaders still adhered , many of them somewhat half-heartedly , to Fox 's policy of Parliamentary Reform . Cobbett and the demoTHE MIDDLE THIRD OF THE CENTURY cratic Radicals also stood for Parliamentary Reform , and though the scheme they would have advocated was far more drastic than anything likely to come from the Whigs the Whigs were the only group that could possibly beat the Tories in the political field . Some of the Whigs , following the lead of Lord Shelburne , a very able though unpopular statesman of the previous generation , had established contact with Bentham . Others were in close touch with the Edinburgh Reviewers . At Iast the death of George IV gave occasion for a general election at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were divided , and the July Revolution which overthrew Charles X of France , proved the danger of resisting the popular will . Many of the Whig candidates at that election inserted Parliamentary Reform into their programmes as an afterthought , born of the results of the Revolution in France . With but little premeditation and beyond their deserts , the Whig leaders found themselves launched upon the undertaking which , after the Revolution of 1688 , will always rank as their most notable achievement . The Whig Government that carried the Reform Bill was , in truth , a motley coalition . At one end of the scale was the Benthamite Brougham ; at the other Melbourne and Palmerston , recent recruits from the Tory party , who regarded the Reform Bill as nothing but a disagreeable necessity , both of them much less inclined towards legislative reform in general than Sir Robert Peel . And it is to be noted that Brougham was , in four years ' time , expelled from the inner counsels of the party , whereas Melbourne and Palmerston were both of them for long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cabinet , Stanley and Graham , passed over into Peel 's Conservative party without perceptibly changing their politics . Graham , as a Peelite , passed back again into the Liberal fold . Stanley , subsequently Lord Derby , became the ally and titular leader of Disraeli in the new Tory party . Charles Greville , Clerk of the Privy Council and writer // of a Diary which is a mine of information about the unofficial opinions of politicians , records that many of the great Whig lords who figured as heroes of the Reform Bill were heartily ashamed of the whole business ' . Enough has been said to suggest that between the Whigs and the Tories of the middle period of the nineteenth century there was very little to choose . Each group of leaders was ready , at the last moment , to enact the repeal of the Corn Law , though , for party reasons , each was reluctant to do so . As Disraeli said , the Whig leaders returned the poisoned chalice ' to Sir Robert Peel . Twenty years later each competed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after 1868 , with the emergence of Gladstone and Disraeli as indisputable leaders of their respective parties , does the strife of parties become once again a strife of policies and of principles . It has often been remarked with truth , that continuous and abundant legislative activity is a distinctive feature of modern political life . The Old Whigs of the first two Georges and the Old Tories of the reign of George III were not active in legislation . Innovation was not , for them , an essential feature of government . The charac-teristically modern abundance of legislation begins a few years before the Reform Bill . It still continues , but we are now concerned only with so much of it as belongs to the middle section of the nineteenth century . The great bulk of that legislation , whether enacted by Whigs or Tories , represents the influence of a single school of thought , the Liberal or Benthamite school . The characteristics of this thought have already been described . It was Liberal in the old and proper sense of that term , in that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were capable of intelligent and useful activity ? all , let us say , who were neither children , ' lunatics , paupers , or criminals . By this means it sought to secure the greatest happiness of the greatest number . It was a policy approTHE MIDDLE THIRD OF THE CENTURY priate to an active and self-reliant nation of shopkeepers . It was indifferent to tradition , despised sentiment , and abhorred muddle and waste . A few illustrations must suffice . The Great Reform Bill of 1832 was essentially Benthamite . It was not a democratic measure , and its authors did not appeal , to democratic sentiments . Its purpose was to enfranchise property and intelligence , to enfranchise not the greatest number ' but those whose political power was most likely to promote the greatest happiness of the greatest number . Listen to Lord Chancellor Brougham as he recommends the Bill to the House of Lords . If there is a mob , there is the people also . I speak now of the middle classes  --  of those hundreds of thousands of respectable persons ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the community : for if all your lordships ' castles , manors , rights of warren and rights of chase , with all your broad acres , were brought to the hammer and sold at fifty years ' purchase , the price would fly up and kick the beam when counterpoised by the vast and solid riches of those middle classes , who are also the genuine depositaries of sober , rational , intelligent , and honest English feeling . ' He prefaces his recommendation of the proposed new electorate with an Odi profanum vulgus . He claims , it is tt ue , in his oratorical frenzy , that this mob is comparatively small and his middle class the most numerous order in the community , but that was doubtless not meant for cold print . The new electorate was but a handful , a few hundred thousands . Thirty years later a second Reform Bill enlarging the electorate had obviously become due . Why ? Had the Whig and Tory statesmen who competed to enact it become democrats ? Certainly not . The assumption underlying and justifying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and honest English feeling ' had spread further down the social scale . There is no need to demonstrate that Acts extending 8o THE NEW POOR LAW freedom of trade , and Acts extending religious equality , such as Catholic Emancipation , the admission of Jews to parliament and the abolition of University tests , are illustra-tions of Benthamite Liberalism . The same is true of a series of Acts giving individuals greater freedom in the disposal of their property , and of the Divorce Act of 1857 , facilitating divorce . At first sight the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834 might seem to represent a revulsion from Benthamism . It was much the most important 1 as it was also much the most unpopular of the Acts of the first Reformed Parliament . More than - anything else it provoked the Chartist move-ment . An Act which terminated a system of wholesale doles to the poor and substituted the workhouse , does not at first sight seem an Act for the promotion of the greatest happiness of the greatest number . But there were , it must be remembered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and waste . It stood for business methods in administration . Its interest was in the self-supporting , self-reliant individual . The authors of the Act intended to relieve such individuals , namely the ratepayers , from an intolerable burden , arid they believed that the hardships they were imposing upon the recipients of the dole would drive these unfortunates into self-reliance and self-help . The Act was also entirely in accord with the Population doctrines of Malthus , and those doctrines had from the first been accepted by the Benthamite school . The system of doles abolished by the Act had been graded in accordance with the size of the family . Some held that , as the doles were administered , it actually paid to have more children , even illegitimate children ; and over-population , according to Malthus , was the prime cause of poverty . The abolition of the doles would check population , and the workhouses would check // it still further , for an important feature of the workhouse in the eyes of all supporters of the Bill was the segregation of the sexes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parlia-ment elected by the mob ' would not have dared to administer it . More definitely on the fringe of Benthamism was the great Education Act of i870 , and one observes that it was postponed until the end of the Benthamite epoch . It followed the second Reform Bill , and carried out the advice of Robert Lowe , an opponent of that measure , when he said We must educate our masters ' . State grants to volun-tary educational societies had begun in 1833 and had steadily increased . The Act of 187o created State schools to fill the gaps left by the voluntary societies . Though it did not in fact make education universally compulsory , it was dearly an advance towards that goal . The Act was anti-Benthamite in so far as it took the money of the self-reliant and spent it on the children of those who could not or would not educate their children at their own expense . But its aim , the promotion of intelligence , was in the earliest and most orthodox Benthamite tradition . James Mill , had he been alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious teaching in State schools , but in all other respects would certainly have given the Act his whole-hearted support . The Factory Acts , on the other hand , were carried in defiance of orthodox Liberalism , and the opposition they encountered from statesmen otherwise leaders in legislative reform , such as Peel , Gladstone , and Cobden , prove that they were against the spirit of the age . They were the work of laborious and obstinate philanthropists who insisted THE EDUCATION ACT upon dragging the horrors of the uncontrolled factories and mines into the light of day . The facts were eloquent and appalling , yet even so the cry of the children was drowned again and again by the clashing cymbals of the Benthamite orchestra . Shaftesbury was not a political theorist : he was an Evangelical philanthropist devoting himself to the factory slaves of England as Wilberforce and Buxton had devoted themselves to the plantation slaves of the tropics . Yet the Factory reformers had to make a concession to Liberalism . If they had asked parliament to infringe the liberty ' of grown-up men to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing at all . They concentrated on the women and children , who could not be expected to know how to use their liberty . Even so , of course , the liberty of the employer was infringed , and his champions put up a stout fight on his behalf . It would , as anyone can now see , be very easy to defend the Factory Acts , like the Education Act , on Benthamite grounds . One need not press the argument that the best employers have found that sweated labour , like slave labour , does not pay ; for the argument , though one would like to accept it , is not universally valid . But in the national interest it is surely plain that sweated labour could not promote rationality and sobriety , and it was on the spread of rationality and sobriety that prospects of an indefinite extension of individual liberty ultimately depended . Shaftesbury , however , did not argue along these lines . He was in all respects , in his strength and in his weakness , the complete anti-Benthamite . He disbelieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized as the most important sphere of life , religion . He was scarcely more eager to shorten the hours of child labour than to prevent the opening of the Crystal Palace on Sundays . Still there were occasions when the organizir.b Leal of those Benthamites who hated muddle more than they loved liberty brought them into alliance with the Evangelical philanthropist . A series of epidemics directed the attention // of the Government to questions of drainage and watersupply . A Health of Towns Act was carried ( 1848 ) establishing a Board of Health , with powers to investigate local conditions and coerce local authorities . At its head was placed Edwin Chadwick , an ardent Benthamite who had accumulated a great store of unpopularity by the ruthless efficiency with which he had administered the New Poor Law , and Shaftesbury was one of his colleagues . The objects of the Board were admirable and its energies exemplary , but it only lasted six years and its abolition was enthusiastically applauded . The Benthamism of bureaucratic organization had overshot the mark and was defeated by the more popular Benthamism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , says its leaderwriter , to take our chance of cholera and the rest , rather than to be bullied into health . . It was a perpetual Saturday night , and Master John Bull was scrubbed and rubbed and small tooth-combed till the tears ran into his eyes , and his teeth chattered , and his fists clenched themselves with worry and pain . ' In exactly the same spirit Macaulay , a few years earlier , dismissed some of the schemes of philanthropic organization suggested by the poet Southey , who combined , like Shaftesbury , an ardent humanity with a complete indifference to liberty . He conceives ' , says Macaulay , that the business of the magistrate is to be a jack-of-all-trades ? architect , engineer , schoolmaster , merchant , theologian , a Lady Bountiful in every parish , a Paul Pry in every house , spying , eaves-dropping , relieving , admonishing , spending our money for us , and choosing our opinions for us . ' Shaftesbury and Chadwick would gladly , for different reasons , have undertaken all or most of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way to being State Socialists , and the age of Socialism was not yet . Perhaps the most remarkable achievement of Benthamit Liberalism was that , for a whole generation , it secured the allegiance of the leaders of the industrial working-classes ; the Scotch feelosopher 's ' policy was for the time being // crowned with success . That generation begins not in 1832 , but somewhere between 1840 and 1850 , and its conversion was promoted by an event more convincing than any argument , the setting in of the great mid-Victorian prosperity , which followed close upon the hungry ' ? that is , the early ? ' forties , and lasted until the middle ' seventies . The causes of that prosperity , in itself one of the essential features of what we call Victorianism , were many . Free-traders attributed it to free trade , and it certainly killed protectionism . Perhaps the principal cause was the develop-ment of the railways and steamships , which enabled transport to keep pace with productivity . Throughout the first half of the century Labour was in a state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new conditions of industry , but against the new conditions themselves . The first genera-tion of the factory workers was homesick for the green fields , and the immense vogue of Cobbett was based , at least in part , upon the fact that when he wrote for the towns-man he remained at heart a countryman . The revolt expresses itself in its crudest form in the machine breaking of the Luddites in the closing years of the French war . The crude early socialisms of Spence and Owen 1 derived such attractions as they possessed from the fact that they were sketches of Utopia . The Chartist programme of the ' thirties with its parliamentary democracy defined in Six Points seems to be more substantial , but the famous Charter presented only the most superficial aspect of Chartism . The Chartist leaders were never agreed as to what they wanted nor as to how they should set about getting it . Chartism was simply an attempt , doomed to failure , to organize a general discontent . The complete failure of the Chartist Movement has committed to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these leaders were very far from confining themselves to the Six Points ' and the repeal THE MIDDLE THIRD OF THE CENTURY of the Poor Law . One of the most active in the industrial North was James Raynor Stephens , a Nonconformist minister who had quarrelled with the Wesleyans and founded a sect of his own . In 1838 he gave notice to the mill-owners in the following terms : If they do not reform , they shall have the revolution they so much dread . We shall destroy their abodes of guilt . . . . If they will not learn to act as law prescribes and as God ordains , so that every man shall by his labour find comfortable food and clothing . . . we have sworn by God , by heaven , and by hell , that we shall wrap in one awful sheet of devouring flame the manufactories of the cotton tyrants and the palaces of those who raised them by rapine and murder . ' Stephens and his friends ? they formed only one section among the Chartists ? were the heralds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swayed by the passions of an age which , if not past , was rapidly passing . By the middle year of the century such language could nowhere have been heard in England . The Chartist Movement was beaten off the field by the Anti-Corn Law League which , organized by manufacturers , sought to persuade the working man that the cause of his troubles was neither his exclusion from the franchise nor his inclusion in the factory , but the artificially created expensiveness of his daily bread . The successful co-opera-tion of master and man in the work of the League may be taken as the beginning of conversion of the working classes to the new industrialism . At the same time the worst tyrannies of the factory system were being curtailed by the Factory Acts , and another group of Acts , less familiar to the general reader , were soon to make those tyrannies less necessary to the mill-owner ) . Acts of Parliament of 1855 and 1862 legalized the Limited Liability Company , BENTHAMIZED LABOUR the form of company , that is to say , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his investment , however great may be the debts of the company in which he has invested his money . Before this type of company was legalized the manufacturer had been hard put to it to find capital for building up his business . Often his own savings were the only resource he could draw upon , and he was tempted to save at all costs , particularly at the cost of his employees . Henceforth the entrepreneur as economists called him , the enterpriser in business , could draw much more freely upon the savings of that great sleeping partner the general public , for the general public was much more ready to lend under the new safeguards . The workman began to be better paid and could now be encouraged to save and invest , and enjoy for himself what economists called the rewards of abstinence ' ; hitherto his abstinence had been enforced and unrewarded . Henceforth the organization of thrift began to take the place of the organization of revolt . Two years before the final fiasco of Chartism on Kennington Common in 1848 there was founded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its members ' purchases . Friendly Societies for working-class insurance were already developing , and the Government , cordially approving of such enterprises , established a Registry of Friendly Societies , which certified the businesslike management of such Societies as submitted their accounts for registration . There was also founded in 1846 the Permanent Building Society to advance money to working men for the purchase of their houses . Trade Unionism developed among skilled craftsmen ? and the distinction both in work and in wages between skilled and unskilled labour was vastly greater in those days of comparatively primitive machinery than it is to-day . These trade unions of the new model ' , such as the Amalgamated Society of Engineers , provided their members with unemployment , sickness , and superannuation benefits , and were consequently averse from strikes . In the ' sixties a // group of able trade union secretaries established close contact with one another and with sympathetic professional men in the ranks of politics and journalism , among such being the barrister , Tom Hughes , the old pupil of Dr. Arnold of Rugby and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade union secretaries has been called the Junta . They were eminently moderate men , and as firmly convinced of the inevitability of the capitalist system as any employer could be . Their aim was to secure from all employers the conditions of labour already granted by the best . In fact a thoroughly Benthamized aristocracy of labour ' , imbued with middle-class ideals ' , had developed itself , and was ripe for enfranchisement by the second Reform Bill . The outlook of the Junta was as far removed from that of the Luddites of fifty years before as it is removed from the left-wing Socialists of fifty years afterwards . Self-help was the ideal of the day , and in 1859 Samuel Smiles published the book which bears that title . It had an enormous success , twenty thousand copies being sold in the year of publication and 130,000 more in the next thirty years . Other volumes followed in the same vein from the same pen ? Thrift , Character , Duty , and a series of Lives of successful inventors and industrialists . Self-Help is an amiable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sermons on industry and honesty , enlivened with innurn  - -  erable anecdotes from the lives of the virtuous and successful . A sample from the Table of Contents gives an accurate notion of the book . Any of its thirteen chapters would do equally well , and I select at random : CHAPTER IX . MONEY-USE AND ABUSE The right use of money a test of practical wisdom ? Economy necessary to independence ? The improvident classes helpless ? Importance of frugality as a public question ? Words of Richard Cobden and John Bright  --  - Independence within reach of most working men ? High purposes // of economy ? Advice given to Francis Horner by his father ? Robert Burns ? Living within the means ? Wasters  - -  Running into debt ? The debtor a slave ? Haydon 's debts ? Fichte ? Dr. Johnson on Debt ? The Duke of Wellington on Debt ? Washington ? Earl St. Vincent ?

The power of money over-estimated ? Joseph Brotherton ? Respectability , its highest standard . ' Matthew Arnold had a very pretty gift of parodying a phase of public opinion by selecting a ludicrous example of it . The Gospel according to Samuel Smiles he found compressed into a nutshell in the beautiful sentence Sir Daniel Gooch quoted to the Swindon workmen , which I treasure as Mrs. Gooch 's Golden Rule , or the Divine Injunction " Be ye Perfect " done into British ? the sentence Sir Daniel Gooch 's mother repeated to him every morning when he was a boy going to work : Ever remember , my dear Dan , that you should look forward to being some day manager of that concern . ' Among the greater writers of books two have been accepted as exponents of the Benthamite or Victorian-Liberal phase of thought , Thomas Babington Macaulay and John Stuart Mill . Both were sons of eminent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allies of Wilber-force in his anti-slavery crusade , and was reckoned the austerest member of the Clapham sect . James Mill we have already met as the most rigid and indefatigable of the Benthamites . Zachary Macaulay detested the atheism of James Mill and James Mill despised the superstitious enthusiasm of Zachary Macaulay , but they were really very similar men , ardently industrious and public-spirited Puritans . Both were extremely stern fathers . We may // carry the parallel further , though it becomes a parallel with an element of contrast . Macaulay wrote essays attacking the Utilitarian philosophy , yet he was in all essentials a fairly complete embodiment of Utilitarian or Benthamite thought . John Stuart Mill was carefully trained to be an apostle of Utilitarianism , and he never ceased to call himself a Utilitarian , but his creed developed so far from its starting-point that he became in effect one of the principal critics of the cruder doctrines of the school in which he was enrolled . John Morley , writing shortly after both had died , says that Macaulay and Mill were the two principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : It might perhaps be said of these two distinguished men that our public writers owe most of their virtues to the one , and most of their vices to the other . If Mill taught some of them to reason , Macaulay taught more of them to declaim ; if Mill set an example of patience , tolerance , and fair examination of hostile opinions , Macaulay did much to encourage oracular arrogance , and a rather too thrasonical com-placency ; if Mill sowed ideas of the great economic , political , and moral bearings of the forces of society , Macaulay trained a taste for superficial particularities , trivial circumstances of local colour , and all the paraphernalia of the pseudo-picturesque. ' 1 From all which it appears that Morley preferred Mill to Macaulay : he had been , in fact , Mill 's devoted friend and disciple . It is amusing , then , to note that the style of this passage , with its smart antitheses and slapdash judgements , is very reminiscent of Macaulay 's weaker moments . Macaulay was one of the few who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his back on public life and preferred to be as man of letters . He was consumed with a passion for histor , particularly the history of England , and in his Essays , republished from the Edinburgh Review , and in his great unfinished History he did more than any Englishmah has ever done to popularize , for his MACAULAY own generation , the study of English history . The extent of his success is half forgotten to-day . Morley was , as we have seen , no great admirer of Macaulay , yet in 1881 , more than twenty years after Macaulay 's death , he could write : If we are to talk about " popular histories " , the writer who distances every competitor by an immeasurable distance is Macaulay . . . . His Essays have done more than any other writings of this generation to settle the direction of men 's historical interest and curiosity . From Eton and Harrow down to an elementary school in St. Giles 's or Bethnal Green , Macaulay 's Essays are a text-book . At home and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible . ' We have , then , to ask how he presented his subject . He cared nothing for the Middle Ages , and wrote little on any period before " the Reformation . He detested Roman Catholicism , distrusted kings , despised mobs , abhorred Jacobins , and glorified parliaments . His heroes are Pym and Hampden ( but not Cromwell , whom he dismissed after the fashion of his day as a hypocritical schemer and tyrant ) , William of Orange , the Pitts , and Burke , though the Burke of the Reflections on the French Revolution is a lost leader ' for him . His most popular Essays were devoted to Clive and Warren Hastings ; he is enthralled by the splendour of their daring patriotism , but refuses to overlook or condone ( in fact he unintentionally exaggerates , in the case of Hastings ) their high-handed improprieties . His great events are the Reformation , though he despises the subtle and scholarly Cranmer ; the Long Parliament ? he is brutally contemptuous in his treatment of Charles I and Laud ; the Glorious Revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' is Egypt ; the Reformation is the Exodus ; and the passage of the Great Reform Bill is the entry into the Promised Land . There is of course no single Moses , though at a critical stage in the journey William III assumes a stature worthy of that patriarch . But of the whole it would be true to say that the British Israelites of Macaulay 's 9x THE MIDDLE THIRD OF THE CENTURY history need no monarch . The English People directs its own destinies , and People ' in Macaulay must generally be understood to mean the parliamentary classes . Macaulay in fact fixed firmly in the popular mind what some now call the Whig legend ' of English histcry , and as such are seeking to demolish . Like most good legends it contains a great deal of truth , and the pulling down of Macaulay 's legend has , in recent years , often meant no more than the setting up of another . ' Politically Macaulay was a Whig rather than a Bentham-ite . He was the kind of reformer who approved the reforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fascinated by the prospect of a future of unlimited social and industrial progress . In natural progress ' he is an enthusiastic believer . If ' , he writes , we were to prophesy that in the year 1930 a population of fifty millions , better fed , clad , and lodged than the English of our time , will cover these islands , that cultivation , rich as that of a flower garden , will be carried up to the very tops of Ben Nevis and Helvellyn , that machines constructed on principles yet undiscovered will be in every house , that there will be no highways but railroads , no travelling but by steam , that our National Debt , vast as it appears to us , will appear to our great-grandchildren a trifling encumbrance , which might easily be paid off in a year or two , many people would think us insane . We pro-phesy nothing : but this we say : If any person had told the Parliament which met in perplexity and terror after the crash in 1720 of the South Sea Bubble that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The drift of the argument is plain , J. S. MILL 'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY and the rest of this admirably balanced sentence of a hundred and sixty words can be found near the end of the Essay on Southey 's Colloquies . Macaulay , though his literary career covered thirty-five years ( 1825-1859 ) , remained all his life , as has been said , a man of 1832 . His views were moderately advanced ' in the ' twenties , and somewhat old-fashioned in the ' fifties , but they were the same views . The times had moved and he had not . John Stuart Mill , on the other hand , was a theorist whose theories would not stand still . His mind was not proof against the assaults of new ideas , and his works are a record of intellectual transition . Autobiographies are proverbially interesting , and in the records of nineteenth-century thought there are few books more significant than the brief Autobiography of John Stuart Mill . If it were not a singularly conscientious record of fact one might suppose it was a biographical allegory designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule of life . At the conclusion one is left wondering how far James Mill had succeeded and how far he had failed in the task he set himself , of forming the perfect Benthamite . Certainly he set about his task in no half-hearted manner . John Mill began Greek at three years old ; by the age of seven he had read most of the standard Greek and English historians . Thereafter he was introduced to Latin , algebra , chemistry , philosophy , economics , etc . At the age of sixteen his formal education was complete . He joined his father in the India House ( the office of the East India Company ) , and became a regular contributor to Radical publications . In many respects the education of John Mill had been a signal success ; he had been braced by a training of extraordinary severity , to which the minds of most youths would certainly have . succumbed . Yet it soon began to appear that for John Mill Benthamism was not enough ' . At the age of twenty he found himself confronted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all your objects in life were realized ; that all the changes in institutions and opinions // that you are looking forward to , could be completely effected at this very instant , would this be a great joy and happiness to you ? " And an irrepressible self-consciousness distinctly answered , " No ! " At this my heart sank within me : the whole foundation of which my life was constructed fell down . All my happiness was to have been found in a continual pursuit of this end . The end had ceased to charm , and how could there ever again be any interest in the means ? I seemed to have nothing left to live for . ' 1 Mill found his salvation in the things that his education had omitted as of no account ? in poetry , and particularly in the Nature poetry of Wordsworth . From the poetry of Words-worth he passed to the philosophy of Coleridge , and we have already mentioned the celebrated essay in which Mill ex-pounds Coleridge as the seminal mind ' whose teaching was the necessary complement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an essay had the daring and the paradox of a defence of Voltaire in the columns of the Evangelical Record . Mill never ceased to be a leader of the Benthamites , but he led them a very long way from the point at which he found them . Trained as a sworn foe of aristocracy and privilege , he concludes with an eloquent warning against the tyranny of democracy ; trained as an individualist , upholding laissez-faire and freedom of contract in all departments of economics , he makes , as years pass on , many concessions to the school of thought which promoted the Factory Acts and prepared the way for Socialism ; trained as an advocate of the orthodox Benthamite hedonism , i.e. pleasure ' as the end of life , he transforms it into something not far removed from a philosophy of self-sacrifice ; trained as a free thinker , he reaches at last a position which , though it is not dogmatic Christianity , is probably the position held by many who are prepared to call themselves Christians . Each of these four transformations must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mill published the most popular and eloquent of his books , the Essay on Liberty . It occupies in our nineJ . S. MILL teenth-century literature the place occupied by Milton 's Areopagitica in our seventeenth-century literature , as a plea for freedom of thought and , within the utmost practicable limits , of action . And the tyrant to be feared is no longer a monarch or an aristocracy , but the tyranny of conventional public opinion , which hates and fears originality and the defiance of its prejudices as bitterly as any Inquisition or Starchamber of old . He who lets the world , or his own portion of it , choose his plan of life for him , has no need of any other faculty than the ape-like one of imitation . ' Sometimes the conventional majority will enforce its will by actual legislation , but it is equally dangerous when it exercises no other pressure than that of social disapproval . He finds an obvious example in the Puritanism of his day , which condemned innocent and admirable recreations such as dancing or the theatre . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be peculiar to a later period , the tyranny of trade unions . It is known that the bad workmen who form the majority of the operatives in many branches of industry , are decidedly of opinion that bad workmen ought to receive the same wages as good , and that no one ought to be allowed , through piecework or otherwise , to earn by superior skill or industry more than others can without it . ' As an extreme example of the evil he glances at the experiments in prohibition already being made by certain States of the American Union . ( ii ) In 1847 Mill published his Principles of Political Economy . It rapidly became the standard English treatise upon the subject , and was still the one set book ' on economics in the Oxford History School twenty years ago . One of its most significant chapters is the final one on The Grounds and Limits of the Laissez-faire or Non-interference Principle ' . Laissez faire , says Mill , should be the rule , but he proceeds to enumerate and defend a surprisingly long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and compel parents to send their children to school . It should control the authority of parents over their children and of men // over animals more completely than it does at present . It should be prepared to disannul certain types of contracts between individuals , when the contract is clearly undesirable and the result of the folly of one of the parties . It should control hours of labour , and assist emigration . It is a notable fact that the list of exceptions to laissez-faire grew in successive editions of the book from comparatively small dimensions in the 1 847 edition . Indeed it has been said that the English Fabian Socialists of the 183o 's , advocating socialism by instalments ' , should be regarded as disciples of Mill rather than of Karl Marx . But we shall return to this subject in the next chapter . ( iii ) In a little book called Utilitarianism 1 Mill makes his famous distinction between higher ' and lower ' pleasures . The higher ' pleasures are to be preferred and regarded in fact as more pleasurable pleasures ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the quality as well as the quan-tity of the articles must be taken into account . The higher pleasures may be called happiness ' , and happiness rather than pleasure is the end of life . This view , he tells us in the Autobiography , he never abandoned , but he found that happi-ness was only to be attained by those who set their hearts not on happiness but on something else , ? ' on the happiness of others , on the improvement of mankind , even on some art or pursuit , followed not as a means ( to one 's own happiness ) but as an end in itself . ' This is excellent but it is certainly not Benthamism ! It is , in fact , as Richard Holt Hutton , the editor of The Spectator , remarked , a paradox which should suggest to utilitarians the deepest possible suspicion of the truth of the fundamental idea of their philosophy . That the true end of life should be always in the position of the old gentleman 's macaroons , which he hid about amongst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyed them so much more when he came upon them unawares , J. S. MILL than he did if he went to the cupboard avowedly to look for them , is surely a very odd compliment to the true end of life . The old gentleman did not regard the macaroons as the true end of life ; and as a rule , unquestionably , what we do regard as the true end of life will bear contemplating and working for as such . ' 1 ( iv ) Immediately before his death Mill was engaged on writing Three Essays on Religion , and when they were posthumously published they met with much disapproval among most of those who had accounted themselves his disciples ; and indeed it is not hard to imagine what Bentham and James Mill would have thought of them . Not only does the apostle of rationalism recognize the Utility of Religion ' but he holds in the last essay ( though not in its predecessor ) that the best religion is one involving a Personal God . It can not be questioned ' , he writes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Being who realizes our own best ideas of perfection , and of our being in the hands of that Being as ruler of the universe , gives an increase of power to these feelings ( i.e. aspirations towards goodness ) beyond what they can receive from reference to a merely ideal conception . ' It is true that in the remainder of the essay he expounds the almost insuperable difficulties in the way of such a belief , but , Iike Clean in one of the best of Browning 's poems , he would fain believe it . Mill was not a great thinker ; his superstructure of thought was too ill-fitted to its foundations . But he was a very influential thinker , and a very admirable man . Gladstone , who detested rationalism , spoke of him as the saint of ration-alism ' . He did as much as any freethinker to persuade simple-minded religious people that it is possible to be both an atheist and a good man , and he did this more by his life than by his writings . It was characteristic of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without author 's royalties , in order to bring the hook as much as possible within reach of the purses of working men . That so dry a writer THE MIDDLE THIRD OF THE CENTURY should have been so widely read is in itself a testimonial to the seriousness of his age . To-day the work of elucidating economic and political theory is in the hands of one set of people and the work , more highly remunerated , of serving it up with humorous sauce for popular consumption is in the hands of another set . Perhaps Mill 's most distinctive contribution to national life was his advocacy of the rights of women . His little book The Subjection of Woman was the most important tract on the subject for a whole generation , and during his brief career as a member of parliament he introduced , as an amendment to the second Reform Bill , the first proposal of legislation in favour of Woman Suffrage to be debated in the House of Commons . 98 II THE EVANGELICAL ORTHODOXY AND ITS RIVALS WE have shown the Old Tory domination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energetic optimism of the Utilitarian or Benthamite school of thought . In the same way and at about the same date the authority within the Church of the old High-and-dry school , with its complacent tolerance of worldliness and indolence , was effaced by the ardour of the Evangelicals . They never , perhaps , secured a majority on the episcopal bench , but they provided something more important than bishops ; they provided religion . Benthamism was a Euro-pean movement of thought ; we could find its equivalent under other names in France and Germany . But Evangeli-calism was peculiarly English , and it is therefore the more instructive to take foreign evidence upon it . Halevy , whose great History of the English People in the Nineteenth Century is already , though uncompleted , recognized as a standard authority , finds in Evangelicalism the principal ground of difference between our own modern history and that of other countries . He writes : It was during this critical year , a few months after the passage of the Reform Bill , that English Evangelicalism may be said to have reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preaching , and in their hatred of Catholics and Latitudinarians the Wesleyans were draw-ing closer to the Church from which they were sprung .
