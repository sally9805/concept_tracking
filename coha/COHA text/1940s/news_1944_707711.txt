txt When It Really Does Hail Your editorial in today 's TIMES on Memphis hail brought to mind a statement by C. E. P. Brooks , D. Sc. , in his book " Climate " ( Berm , London , 1932 ) . On page 150 commenting on the climate of South Africa he says , " Hail is remarkably frequent , occurring on 105 day ? a year in the Cape Province and 106 in the Transvaal ; hail storms are most frequent in summer . On the coast precipitation takes the form of soft hail , but true hail occurs in the interior . In the most severe storms some of the hailstones may be as big as cricket balls and weigh up to one and a half pounds ; they pierce corrugated iron roofs like paper , penetrate plowed land to a depth of two or three.inches , and kill sheep and cows . Fortunately . they are not usually accompanied bt wind . " FRED C. Winn , Geography Department , Dickinson War College . Carlisle , Pa. , March 28 , 1944.  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
