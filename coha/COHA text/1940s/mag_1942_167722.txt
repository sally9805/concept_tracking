This is the story of Lieut . General Joseph W. Stilwell 's trip from Burma . It was cabled to TIME early this week by TIME 'S Correspondent Jack Belden , who was with " Uncle Joe " Stilwell through the whole Burma campaign and the long march to India . <P> Marching at a dogged , fixed pace of 105 steps per minute , which became known to us as the " Stilwell Stride , " the iron-haired , grim , skeleton-thin General walked into India with tommygun on shoulder at the head of a polyglot party of weary , hungry , sick American , British and Chinese Army officers , enlisted men , Burmese women nurses , Naga , Chin and Shan tribesmen and a devil 's brew of Indian and Malayan mechanics , railwaymen , cooks , refugees , cipher clerks and mixed breeds of southern Asia . <P> Stilwell , showing no signs of wear except gradually thinning cheeks , led the untrained party of civilians and soldiers through the elephant trails and teakwood forests and jungles of northern Burma , across the Chindwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head-hunting tribesmen to final safety in India , only a few days ' march ahead of the Japanese , without losing a single member of the party . <P> The Chinese Army units under Stilwell 's command were one day 's march behind us when we crossed the Chindwin , but we have had no news of them since then . We have reason to believe that the greater portion of the Chinese Army , except the unit left in the hills of the Shan States at the time of the Jap drive toward Lashio , are safe . <P> For three exhausting weeks Stilwell led our undisciplined , untrained party through a maze of crisscrossing paths , alternately coaxing , urging , commanding them to hurry as we sought to escape the jaws of the gigantic Japanese encircling movement . On the second day of our trek our radio was destroyed and thereafter as far as information went we marched almost blindly . <P> Along the main northern roads in the ebb tide of British Empire our progress was blocked by a leaderless , directionless stream of helpless , pleading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort and aid to reach India . At other times , at the orders of Stilwell , we plunged into the thickest jungles , striking across unknown trails where the only sounds were the screaming of hordes of unseen monkeys and the slitherings of the brightest green poisonous snakes . Alternately scorched by terrific heat under which several of our party faint ed , and drenched by tropical rains , our ranks were affected by dysentery , malaria , heat , exhaustion . Some had sores from infected blisters ; others were suffering from lack of sleep . But all of us were safe . <P> Our inadequate rations were augmented by Karin Kachin , Burmese girl nurses who , under the direction of Major Gordon Seagrave , Burma-born mission doctor , picked berries and vegetables , made stews complementing the small rice diet . Our ofttimes drooping morale was also kept alive by these girls , all of whom were between the ages of 17 and 22 , singing Christian hymns , ancient American jazz , as they marched barefoot downstream through heat-scorched thickets and over rocky trails toward India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male members of the party , to whom at the end of each day they gave medical treatment-piercing blisters , bandaging infections , soothing bruised spirits in as romantic a setting as Hollywood ever conceived .
