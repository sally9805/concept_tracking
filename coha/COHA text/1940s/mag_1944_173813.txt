Ottawa 's bureaucracy was not amused last week when a 15-year-old schoolboy satirized Canada 's red-taped National Selective Service ( the Dominion 's version of the War Manpower Commission ) . Donald Sim , son of a Government official , wrote that he visited Selective Service headquarters in Ottawa and told a functionary : <P> " I 've found a job for the summer and I 'd like the necessary permits to take it . " <P> The rest of the interview , as recorded by Donald for his high-school annual : <P> " For answer the man pulled out a pad of very official forms . . . and stiffly replied : ' You mean you want a permit to look for a job . ' <P> " ' No , I do n't . I 've already found the job . ' <P> " ' According to the laws of Canada , ' he warned , ' you have n't yet . But by following His Majesty 's orders you will be permitted to look for one . Sign here ! ' <P> " ' Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll give you a permit to accept it , ' the man said . ' After a week , when you have your job , come back . ' <P> " ' But I 've got the job now . ' <P> " ' Now , take it easy , son . This is the Government . You do n't understand it and I do n't understand it . The only difference between you and me is that you 're trying to understand it and I 'm not . I 've given up ' ! <P> " So I left Selective Service . For the next week I did nothing . A week later I ... found another boy ... had got my job . " <P> When Ottawa newspapers seized on Satirist Sim 's story , Selective Service officials complained to his teachers . Donald Sim had to appear before the assembled student body , read a prepared retraction . The students who heard him preferred to believe his first story . When he mentioned Selective Service , they burst out laughing .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
