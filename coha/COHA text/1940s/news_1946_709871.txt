txt Col. Robert R. McCormick has come out from behind Tribune Tower to take over the driver 's seat of the Republican Party of Illinois . Colonel McCormick always has exercised the power behind the throne in Republican Illinois politics ; now he is exercising his power openly in front of the throne . He is doing it for a reason  --  for several reasons  --  and the reasons are these : The Chicago Tribune publisher is out to acquire complete , undisputed control over the vitally important 58-member Illinois delegation to the Republican National Convention in 1948  --  and there is no doubt he 'll have it to do with as he wishes . He is acting to establish his political authority so conclusively that any Republican presidential aspirant ' or any Republican presidential nominee would have to do business with McCormick or face the possibly irreparable loss of the largest electoral bloc of any midwestern State . Colonel McCormick , one of the most strident , unyielding , implacgble isolationists in the Republican Party , is seeking to find new means of fastening his views upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national G. 0 . P. leaders to listen to him not merely as the editorial voice of the Chicago Tribune but as the single , authoritative spokesman of the Republican Party in Illinois  --  not alone as the voice which can deliver the editorials but as the voice which can deliver the votes . Finally , the Tribune 's Colonel is out to get a decisive say in picking the 1948 Republican presidential candidate . At best , he wants the most reactionary , isolationist nominee he can get . Probably none would be as conservative or as isolationist as he would like . He has said he would be satisfied with Senator Taft or John W. Bricker , and would consider Governor-Warren . At the least , he is determined to veto the nomination of any liberal internationalist . And Colonel McCormick is n't vague about it . If he can have his way , Governor Dewey , Senator Vandenberg , and Harold E. Stassen are out . /-Today Colonel McCormick sees his opportunity to accomplish all these things . He sees the Kelly Democratic machine , which helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago and Cook County . Consequently , he is letting his informal but long-standing truce with Mayor Kelly  --  as a result of which Colonel McCormick never fought him personally or vigorously in Chicago ? run out . Instead , he is readying for a knock-down battle in the mayoralty election next spring , for he knows that if he can rout the Kelly machine from Chicago 's City Hall , he will emerge as the unchallenged Illinois political dictator . From this position , as he would put Associated Press Col. Robert R. McCormick it , those " money-mad millionaires " of the eastern seaboard who now " rule the G. 0 . P. " would have to pay attention to his counsel . In ending his long truce with Mayor Kelly , Colonel McCormick has fashioned a new relationship with Republican Gov . Dwight Green , with whom he often has been at odds . It is sort of a marriage of political convenience in which , it appears , Governor Green is allowed to live in the same political house with the Colonel as long as he stays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Governor Green aims to fill it . Governor Green 's stake in this mutual arrangement ? to the extent that it is mutual  --  is that he naturally wants to step up onto the national political stage ? a vice - presidential nomination would n't be reiected  --  and he needs unwavering McCormick support for any move in that direction . Colonel McCormick , in his debut speech as the avowed Republican leader of Illinois and M a subsequent interview , has stated that his main mission is to save the Republican Party from " British imperialism " and to keep Vandenberg , Dewey , Stassen , and the like from making the United States a " vassal to some world state . " Dewey he terms un-American , and Stassen a renegade westerner . Under Governor Green in 1944 , the Illinois Republicans were ahead of the convention in helping to promote Governor Dewey 's nomination : Under the new McCormick - Green deal , Illinois wo n't go for Dewey or anybody like him in 1948 , and the Tribune 's Colonel will have a more influential voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  than ever before .
