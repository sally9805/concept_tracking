Adolf Hitler 's chief copy writer was not at his typewriter last week . Scented , elegant , pseudo-intellectual Doktor Alfred Rosenberg ( not to be confused with Jewish Rosenbergs ) had a new job which made him one of the biggest of big Nazi executives . He had become the Reich Minister for the East . As such he stayed in his Berlin offices , but he let his ingenious mind range over the whole 615,000 square miles-thrice the area of Germany in 1937-which Adolf Hitler had conquered in Soviet Russia and now were his to administer . <P> Doktor Rosenberg had as yet had little time for real administrative action . But for months his experts had been planning the economic exploitation of the conquered farms and factories . And certain social innovations might be expected . They were implicit in Doktor Rosenberg 's nickname-The Jew Gobbler . <P> For administrative purposes the vast terrain was divided into two parts : the Ukraine and Ostland ( Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania , White Russia ) . Doktor Rosenberg enraged many Ukrainian nationalists , who for years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by handing two big chunks of the Ukraine to others-Eastern Galicia to the Government of Occupied Poland , the great seaport Odessa to Rumania . <P> It was a proud , almost unbelievable week for the Jew Gobbler . Ever since boyhood he had dreamed dizzying dreams of holding great power in Russia . Now that they were coming true they made his role as Hitler 's copy chief seem small indeed . <P> Rosenberg 's Rise . Yet no copy writer has ever been able to pump more wordy gas into a factual vacuum than Doktor Alfred Rosenberg . Born 47 years ago in Rakvere , Estonia , he was the son of an Estonian mother and a German father who sold leather to shoemakers . Young Alfred went to high schools in Tallinn and Riga , developed a high admiration for - and a profound social inferiority complex about-noble Baltic families descended from medieval Teutonic Knights . Even at this early period it entered Alfred 's head that if one can not be born into an aristocracy , one may at least try to create an aristocracy of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alfred was studying architecture in Moscow . He disapproved of the Russian nobility , who , unlike the Baltic nobles , were occasionally cordial to Jews and other social inferiors . He despised the Communists . After they took power , he had returned to Tallinn to teach drawing and preach antiSemitism . In 1919 , when the Communists approached Estonia , Alfred took his leave . <P> Dandified Alfred Rosenberg , 26 , perfumed and wearing yellow suede gloves , turned up in Munich where he sought out the tiny German Workers Party , which also disliked Jews . He talked all one night in a beer hall with one of the Party members , another middleclass , unsuccessful artist-30-year-old Adolf Hitler . <P> Rosenberg did most of the talking , and Adolf Hitler had never heard anything like it . He talked of a superpeople modeled on Nietzsche 's " blond beasts " who would despise such feeble Christian virtues as humility and tolerance , who would glorify fighting strength and conquer the world , who would , obviously , be the reanimated German people .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
