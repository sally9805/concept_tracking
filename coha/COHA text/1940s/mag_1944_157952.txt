DDT , the wonder insecticide ( TIME , June 12 ) , was last week credited with the most crushing blitz of its career . <P> Three months ago Pennsylvania 's Department of Agriculture decided to try the deadly chemical on the gypsy-moth cater pillar , one of the worst tree-stripping pests in eastern U.S. forests . From an airplane , entomologists sprayed five pounds of DDT per acre over 20 acres of timberland near Scranton . <P> Within a week , despite rains that would have washed out normal insecticides , the caterpillar population was liquidated with out a trace . Entomologist C. F. Campbell thereupon gaily offered a dollar bounty ( out of his own pocket ) for every live caterpillar found in the treated area . By last week he had not lost a dollar . <P> Nor was that all . Entomologists who went hunting in the blitzed acres found that the DDT spray had also wiped out the entire population of leaf-eating insects , black flies and mosquitoes.                @ @ @ @ @
