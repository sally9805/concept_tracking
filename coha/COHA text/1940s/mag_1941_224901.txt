With prices popping around him like popcorn in a fire , busy Leon Henderson last week : <P> &gt; Put a ceiling on hides of 15 a lb. , 2 below recent highs . <P> &gt; Stabilized quotations on several paperboard products . <P> &gt; Started an investigation of silk prices . <P> &gt; Asked Standard Oil of Ohio to postpone a proposed - a- gal. rise in Diesel , tractor and furnace oil prices . <P> &gt; Asked Ford , Studebaker , Chrysler , Nash and Hudson , who raised prices $10 to $53 a car last fortnight , to rescind their decision . He scolded them for not consulting him first . <P> It was possible this week that the oilmen and the automen might not comply . This would be the first direct challenge of the authority behind Henderson 's price ceilings , which he himself describes as mere " jawbone control . " If his jawbone ceases to control , Henderson will go to Congress , ask for specific price legislation , expects to get it .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
