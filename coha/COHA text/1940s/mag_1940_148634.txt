Q. Did Adam and Eve remain faithful to God ? <P> A. Adam and Eve did not remain faithful to God , but broke His command by eating the forbidden fruit . <P> Q.

Adam and Eve , on account of their sin , lost innocence and holiness , and were doomed to sickness and death . <P> Most young U. S. Roman Catholics learn about Original Sin from these questions &; answers in the " Penny " or " Baltimore " catechism , first published in 1885 .

But this is not good Roman Catholic doctrine : Adam , as father of the human race , bore the blame for Original Sin ; Eve , only for her own sin . Last week , at a convention in Kansas City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connell revealed that in the revised U. S. catechism which long has been in preparation ( TIME , Oct. 17 , 1938 ) , Eve will be clearly exonerated . The central question &; answer will probably be stated as simply as in the catechism of the late Cardinal Gasparri ( translated and edited at the Catholic University of America ) : Q. What do we call this sin which comes down to us from Adam ? A. We call this sin which comes down to us from Adam Original Sin .
