Bill Batt let one welcome cat out of the bag last week . He had just been through the first important U.S. tin smelter , he said , and it looked good to him . " I think it will be able to handle all of the Bolivian tin supply , " he continued . " And another thing-in 1940 we felt that this smelter might not stand on its own feet in peacetime ; I concluded that it would . " <P> That Jesse Jones 's Texas tin smelter was at last actually ready to run was good news indeed . Tin-scrimping manufacturers , who had seen nearly two long years elapse since that " emergency " project first hit the headlines , had almost forgotten there was such a thing in prospect . If it is really going to stand on its own feet after the war it will have to be a wonder of low-cost smelting efficiency , for the Bolivian ore it will handle is strictly grade B , and the British-Dutch tin cartel is no mean competitor . <P> Bill Batt 's good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news from Bolivia . Now that the Japs have cornered 90% of the world 's tin supply Bolivia has regretted the 50 a lb. delivered price that looked so good before Pearl Harbor . Bolivia is now talking 60 at the embarkation point . Before the war high grade Straits tin was 50 to 55 . <P> Nothing Bolivia and Jesse Jones 's smelter can do can solve the U.S. tin shortage . Though the U.S. has " a sizable stockpile , " Batt pointed out , it can look forward to no more than 18,000 tons a year from Bolivia-about one-fifth of the nation 's normal peacetime consumption . Ergo , said Batt , " glass and fiber containers are going to have to replace tin to a large extent for civilian use . "
