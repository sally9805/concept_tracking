As the third day of the country 's greatest educational walkout ended , school officials reported at a special meeting of the Board of Education that further attempts to keep the schools open would be dangerous for both children and non-striking teachers . Both the board and Mayor Bernard J. Dowd called upon the State Commissioner of Education to enter the case and help restore the schools to normal . In a letter to Dr. Francis T. Spaulding , State Education Commissioner , Mayor Dowd said that the teachers were in revolt against the city , axid that only direct action by Albany could , solve the unprecedented - situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Education , said last night that he had not received any letter from Mayor Dowd asking his department to intervene in the strike . He said that he would give Mr. Dowd 's request very careful attention when it is received . Report Children Molested The Board of Education heard a warning by Dr. Robert T. Bapst , Superintendent of Schools , that the strikers had been successful ts disrupting the school instruction . Since Monday , when the strike of 2,400 teachers began , the city has kept two high schools and eighteen elementary schools in session . This afternoon fifteen principals presented a first-hand , graphic picture of what was taking place in their schools. , Rarely before in educational history has such a dramatic , and at the same time depressing , account been related . The principals reported children molested by roving gangs of older boys playing " hooky " ; they told // of teachers being abused and heckled , a discipline completely disrupted , of the safety of the pupils endangered . Officials of the Buffalo Teachers Federation , spearheading the strike , greeted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the city had become a farce , the federation called upon " responsible authorities " to make a move that might end the unprecedented strike in the state 's second largest city . $1,025 Increase Sought The teachers are seeking new salary schedules , which would mean annual increases of $1,025 . At present elementary teachers get from $1,775 to $2,575 , and high school instructors receive from $2,175 to $2,975 . They seek a salary schedule for elementary teachers of $2,400 to $3,600 , and for high school teachers from $2,400 to $4,000 . The city has indicated that it does not have sufficient taxing powers to provide this additional sum . With the closing of the schools seventy-two thousand children will get an enforced holiday , and 2,968 teachers will be outpf work . If the strike continues for any length of time , it will mean that school may have to be kept in session during part of the summer vacation to meet the state 's minimum requirement of 190 school days .

Pointing out that the city was financially helpless to raise more taxes for the schools , the Mayor charged that the crisis , far from being a local issue , was fundamentally a state problem . Denouncing the " open revolt against the Government " by the teachers , Mayor Dowd said that everything possible to provide funds for an adequate cost-of-living adjustment was being done . A settlement could have been reached , he declared , without resort to a strike . Offered Full Charge " With reference to the threat of the striking teachers to remain away from their duties until they receive assurance , by the state or city that their demands will be satisfied , you are in a better position than I am to judge the ability or disposition of the state to find money for further increases in teachers ' salaries , " Mr. Dowd wrote to the commissioner . " On behalf of the citizens of Buffalo , and particularly the 70,000 school children denied the right to pursue an education , I appeal to you as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools to intervene in this revolt against the duly constituted state educational " authority . " With all the earnestness at my command , 1 ask you to assume through your office and your designated representatives full charge of and responsibility for whatever negotiations are to be carried on between constituted authority and the striking teachers . " Support for the teachers came from various sources during the day . An open letter to the Board of Education , signed by eight prominent local clergymen , urged the city to settle the strike as rapidly as possible . Pointing out that education is important in our society , the clergymen declared that funds could be found to pay teachers adequately and to provide the children with the best in public education . Although the strike is deplorable and tragic , it is not a " crime , " the religious leaders held . Tells of Roving Gangs " Roving gangs of boys have been running through my school , " Miss Helen Weis , principal of Public School 45 , told the board . " My children seem shocked . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was closed . They were told to chew gum in class and make the teachers earn their money . " " Today a teacher collapsed in the classroom , " Albert Myers , principal of Public School 39 , said . " She 'll probably be out the rest of the year . It 's just wrecking the teachers to ask them to work under such conditions . " " Children in my school are on the picket line , " Miss Elizabeth Matson , principal of Public School 74 , remarked . " They are carrying placards which read : ' We want our own teachers back . ' Teachers are met with a barrage of snowballs and are called bad names . " Similar stories were heard from more than a dozen school heads . The total impression was one of a completely disorganized , disrupted and paralyzed school system . " The recital of these events weigh heavily on me , " Dr. Bapst said , breaking in on the steady stream of reports . " They are the result of the hysteria that la a natural outgrowth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
