As midnight drew near , crowds jammed the Senate galleries like spectators at a dance marathon . The House had finished its work with a comfortable margin ; its members were lustily singing barbershop chords and happily contemplating a five-month vacation . <P> But in the Senate one bitter speech followed another . Texas ' white-maned Senator Tom Connally shook a trembling finger at Michigan 's Republican Senator Homer Ferguson , accusing him of pouring out " the vomit of his hate , prejudice , rancor and ambition . " While Bob Taft pleaded with him , Idaho 's banjo-playing Democratic Senator Glen Taylor cunningly piled books on his desk as though he was preparing to make a long harangue . He sent a note to the press gallery : " Do n't worry . . . I 'm not going to make a speech . I just want to drive Taft to distraction-senatorial term for nuts . " <P> Midnight ( supposedly the deadline ) passed . The battle went on .

The first Republican Congress in 16 years had done its work in an atmosphere supercharged with politics . With a Democrat in the White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxygen . The Both had committed its share of sins , and demonstrated the normal leaning of Congress toward mediocrity . It also had had moments of decision , restraint and even greatness . <P> U.S. history held few more dramatic demonstrations of national unity than the 80th 's record on foreign affairs . For that record , Arthur Vandenberg was largely responsible . And Congress had demonstrated resolution in some of its handling of domestic affairs . The Republicans had begun the session by refusing to seat Senator Theodore ( " The Man " ) Bilbo , Mississippi 's evangelist of racial discrimination . In passing and then re-passing the Taft-Hartley labor bill over the President 's veto , Republicans and Democrats both ( but mainly Republicans ) had ignored the clamor from labor and also from the extreme right . The 80th had re-established the sovereignty of the legislative process . <P> It had quickly silenced the hubbub over portal-to-portal pay suits . It had voted for unification of the armed services . It had managed to reduce appropriations from $1.2 billion to $2.5 billion ( rival Democratic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault that income taxes were not reduced . They had tried .
