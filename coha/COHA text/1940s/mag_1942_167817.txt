Brazilian workers mourned a decomposing head and two half-devoured arms-the dubious remains of a national hero . <P> Manoel Olimpio Meira , called " Jacare " ( Alligator ) after his natal village , became the modern hero of Brazil 's jangadeiros , half-starved " sharecropping " fishermen , last autumn when he and three mates sailed their flimsy jangada ( sailing raft ) Sao Pedro on a 61-day , 1,650-mile trip to Rio de Janeiro to tell President Vargas the fishermen 's troubles . From Getulio Vargas they won full union rights-and pensions . Their story ( TIME , Dec. 8 ) so kindled Cinema Director Orson Welles ( Citizen Kane ) that he flew Jacare and his mates to Rio again , to enact their feat for his camera . <P> Jacare took to his new task with simple dignity . He had always idolized a legendary jangadeiro called " Dragon of the Seas " who kidnapped slaves , hid them safely from posses in the hinterland . If the Dragon could free slaves from slavery , figured Jacare , he could free the jangadeiros from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Last fortnight , the luck ran out . During the filming of a shark-octopus battle , Jacare was spilled from the tricky jangada . Though he managed to swim away , he was caught in a treacherous current and , like his fisher-father before him , swallowed by the sea . <P> But last week , when a 440-lb. shark caught off Barra da Tijuca was opened , there rolled out a human head , two human arms . Jacare 's own comrades , examining the teeth , were doubtful it was Jacare. though expert criminologists , judging from the skull formation and skin color , were sure it was from Jacare 's region . In any case , it was another poor jangadeiro . <P> Deeply moved , Orson Welles revised his script , now dedicated throughout to " An American Hero . " Inspired by Jacare 's feat , four messenger boys of the Telegrafo Nacional planned to walk the same distance from Fortaleza to Rio to ask President Vargas for a better wage . But what would have pleased Jacare most was that the first pension won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nine children .
