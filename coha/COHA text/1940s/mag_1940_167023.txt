To the defense of public morals in Istanbul rushed one Ibrahim Hakki Konyali , a Turk of doubtful learning but steely ethic . Haled into court at his insistence was the publisher of the first Turkish translation of Aphrodite , by Pierre Louys , for 50 years a classic of carnality among Frenchmen and U. S. undergraduates . Istanbul bubbled like a hookah . Enlightened Turkish newspapers were highly incensed with Ibrahim Hakki Konyali . Then on Istanbul book stalls appeared a new Aphrodite , adorned with a photograph of a sculptured nude , billed as " the book everyone is talking about . " The author : Ibrahim Hakki Konyali . <P> Content of this little come-on was merely an attack on the Pierre Louys book , but Self-Publicizer Konyali soon got it in the neck . The real Aphrodite was acquitted of obscenity charges , Konyali and the Public Prosecutor were both flayed in Cumhuriyet ( The Republic ) , Turkey 's leading daily . Last week the Prosecutor , fuming , had brought suit against 19 separate newspapers .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
