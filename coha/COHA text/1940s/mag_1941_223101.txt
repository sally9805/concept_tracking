No such machine tool had ever been built before . It took 1 7 months to set up , cost $25,000,000 , spread over 3,000 acres , now takes 10,000 men to run it . This Brobdingnagian tool is the ' Navy 's great new air station at Jacksonville , Fla. - " Jax " for short . Last week , as it spun into full speed , out came its first sample products-three young Ensigns in the U.S. Navy 's air arm . <P> In six months this raw civilian material - an ex-coxswain of the Harvard crew , a Yale-and Virginia-weaned son of a Manhattan broker , a Rollins College tennis player - had been ground and polished into finished products . Their juts of individualism had been smoothed off , the working equipment of an aviator , the military mold and manners of an officer , fitted on . <P> Last December , as these three entered the gates of the air station , the machine tool was still abuilding . On the right were dozens of pearl-grey barracks with colonial facades , long mess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hangars skirting the vast bare landing field . Now , just six months later , the arid newness is gone . Grass grows beside the streets , palm and pine spot the once dusty table land . The 200 cadets who stream in each month from the odds &; ends of civilian life see a brisk hustle of officers and trainees in their khaki service uniforms or bright whites . That first look shows them that they have come into a new way of living . <P> Skin Off , Skin On . Intense is the word for Jacksonville 's training . The Navy makes it coldly clear from the start that no dime-novel fliers are wanted . New cadets are greeted with the warning : " Re member that you are Naval officers as well as Naval aviators . " To show that these are no idle words , the Navy spends the first six weeks of its precious training time schooling the novice cadets in its traditions , odd jargon and technical functions . Before a cadet can pin on the silver bar of a Second Classman - the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must bone up for many a long , hot and sleepy hour on the rudiments of engines , aerodynamics , aerology , gunnery , navigation , the dit-dit-dahs of radio code . <P> By the time Jax turns a fledgling loose in a " yellow peril " ( primary trainer ) , the Navy has fashioned him into the rough framework of a seagoing man . He says " Knock off the chatter " when he means shut up , " shove off " when he means leave , calls the floor " the deck , " tells you to " bear a hand " instead of hurry up , describes things as " squared away " when they are in order . From 5 a.m. reveille to 9 p.m. taps , he takes orders and gets little thanks . He learns not to resent the peremptory nature of commands , comes to see that brusqueness and military efficiency go together . <P> As he begins to shed his thin civilian skin , the Jacksonville cadet finds his existence pretty comfortable . There are the six tennis courts , a swimming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where tax-free Tom Collinses sell for 20 . Outside his hard-driven hours he has no responsibilities . With $75 a month to fritter away on weekends or payments on a car , he seems to have ample funds for his brief periods " ashore " - Saturday nights and Sundays .
