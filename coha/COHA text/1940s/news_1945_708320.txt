txt Governor Dewey opened the door today for an increase in the State 's contributions for the education of elementary and secondary school students by appointing a committee of five to study revision of the Friedsam formula and to make recommendations for setting up technical institutes at State expense to provide vocational training . The committee , which has been charged with preparing its recommendations in time for action at the legislative session which begins tomorrow , will consist of Senator Benjamin F. Feinberg , President pro tempore of the Senate ; Oswald D. Heck , Speaker of the Assembly ; George D. Stoddard , Commissioner of Education ; John E. Burton , Director of the Budget , and Charles D. Breitel , counsel to the Governor . It will have the assist-1 ance of a technical staff in making its studies and drawing up recommendations . In announcing the appointments Governor Dewey said : " The future of our State rests with the children . To the extent that adequate education is supplied to those children , they grow to full developed maturity and good citizenship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the immediate present it is second to no objective except that of the war effort . Revised State Aid an Objective " The primary purpose of our educational system is to improve the quality , character and preparation of our people . After an extensive study by members of the State Administration I am of the opinion that if we are to- continue adequately to meet this purpose over the State as a whole , the system of State aid must be altered and liberalized . " The Friedsam formula devised in 1926 needs revision to recognize the many developments since that time . We must not alter in any way the local management of the schools . We must enable the local authorities to develop and train their children in accordance with modern standards : " The committee will also report on a detailed program for the technical institutes which were authorized by an act of the Legislature in 1944 . " In order to expedite action , I have appointed a committee of the leaders of the Legislature and members of the Administration to weigh and appraise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendations be made adequately before the end of the coming session of the Legislature . " Rise in School Costs Is Cited The demand for revision of the Friedsam formula which governs the apportionment of State aid to school districts arises from the fact that under present conditions it would materially reduce the amount which the State contributes toward meeting educational costs . State aid , under the formula , is based on the average daily attendance at public elementary and secondary schools and is adjusted to take account of differences in the tax-raising abilities of local communities . When the formula was adopted , the minimum cost of maintaining a single elementary class was computed at $1,500 a year and a high school class at $1,900 a year . Since 1926 , mandatory salary // schedules have been increased by legislative action and many new educational services have been required , such as instruction in agricultural , home economics , music , art and vocational subjects . The minimum cost of an elementary class has been computed now at $3,000 a year . Another objection to the formula is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adult education classes in computing average daily attendance . State Aid at Peak in 1940 State aid for education reached its peak under the formula in 1940 , when a total of $118,300,000 was paid out . Actually the total should have been $120,600,000 had the formula been met , but the Legislature refused to make such a large appropriation . In 1941 the amount required by the formula dropped to ; 115,000 , - 000 . Last year the amount called for by the formula was $106,300 , - 000 , but $107,800,000 was provided . Were it not for a law enacted last year pegging the amount which each district is entitled to receive , it would drop this year to $102 , - 440,000 . Including the amount needed for pegging it will be $108,200,000 unless the formula is changed . The substantial drop is caused primarily by declining school attendance . This decline has been sharpest in secondary schools since 1940 , reflecting the induction of boys over 18 years old into the military services and the lure of high wages in industry for others . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school attendance in the cities dropped from 443,820 to 367,735 . In the same period , because of the lower birth rate of the Nineteen Thirties , average daily attendance at elementary schools in the cities dropped from 894,333 to 805,970 . Attendance Declines Listed Average daily attendance at all city , village and rural school , including elementary and secondary grades , dropped from 2,168,757 in the school year 1940-41 to 1,658 , - 785 in 1942-43 . The difficulties in which local educational , officials find themselves today arise from the fact that they can not curtail teaching , maintenance and administrative staffs and debt charges at the same ratio as the drop in attendance . In making its recommendations for setting up the technical institutes , the committee will be asked to decide whether the institutes should be open to high school graduates only or whether students who have completed some high school work but not all should also be admitted . The question whether the technical high schools in New York City can be fitted into the program and on what basis , so far , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned , will also be considered .
