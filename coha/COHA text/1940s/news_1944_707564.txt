txt President Roosevelt stepped directly into the Congressional controversies and deadlocks over service ( men 's voting programs today , and in a bluntly worded message branded the " States ' rights " measure passed by the Senate last month and now awaiting action in the House as " a fraud on the soldiers and sailors and marines . " He endorsed the new Green-Lucas compromise bill now under consideration by the Senate , and its companion , the Worley measure , which sponsors are seeking to force to a record vote in the House as a substitute for the bill which the Senate has set out to displace . Of the **38;1520;TOOLONG bill , now awaiting House action , the President stated : " I consider such proposed legislation a fraud on the soldiers and sailors and marines now in training and fighting for us and for our sacred rights . It is a fraud upon the American people . It would not enable any soldier to vote with any greater facility than was provided by Public Law 712 ( the 1942 act ) under which only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wants Congress on Record The message noted a possibility that record votes might be avoided in Congress in a showdown test between a Federal and a State ballot program . " This is solely a legislative matter , " the message said , " but I think most Americans will agree with me that every member of the two houses of Congress ought to be willing in justice ' to stand up and be counted . ' " In the House , as the clerk read the " fraud " passage , members on the Republican side of the aisle booed . Laughter broke out from the same quarter as the President stated that , as Commander in Chief of the armed forces , he was sure he could express their wishes and their resentment against " the discrimination which is being practiced against them . " There was more laughter when the President asserted that he could speak " as an interested citizen . " The message provoked expressions of resentment in Democratic as well as Republican ranks on both sides of the Capitol . The charge of fraud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 of twenty-four members of the President 's own party appeared to bite most deeply . Some Senators and House members denounced the message as a fourth term instrument and an unwarranted intervention . The Senate was about to receive a new " State 's rights " substitute from Senator Robert A. Taft , Republican of Ohio , when the message was read . " The legislation which I just offered is very much the same legislation of which the President has just said was ' a fraud ' and was ' meaningless , ' " Senator Taft said . " I , as one of those who proposed the State voting method , resent the designation by the President of the United States that the action I propose to take is a fraud . " It is no fraud . In my opinion it is the proper way to provide for the soldiers to vote , and it will provide for voting by the soldiers and the House bill will provide for voting by the soldiers . " In fact , I think it was most unfortunate that the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , in this intervention to use language which is a direct insult to the members of this body and a direct insult to the members of the House of Representatives . " At a later time I will deal with the various statements which were made in the President 's message , some of which I think are not true , others of which are , of course , argumentative and I think unsoundly argumentative . " Even beforehand , the ranks of the Southern Democrats who had supported the " States Rights " bill last month began to break with the disclosure that several intended to support the Green-Lucas compromise . Senator Stewart of Tennessee later took the floor to support the Federal ballot plan . " I think it was exceedingly unfortunate , " he said , " that the President should accuse members of the Senate of fraud . ' I am going to support the Green-Lucas bill , but 11 voted for the bill passed by the Senate in December , and I do n't consider that I perpetrated a fraud on the American people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraud . " Senator Barkley , the majority leader , said he was satisfied that the President was speaking only of the effect of the legislation and not , of the action of the individual members . " I thank the Senator for his explanation and I hope it is correct , " Senator Stewart said . Senate consideration of the voting measures will be resumed tomorrow . In the House , apparently in response to the passage declaring the members should he willing to " stand up and be counted , " Joseph 1W . Martin , the minority leader , prose and said the Republicans had been waiting to act for a month . He ( asked unanimous consent for immediate House action on the pending " States Rights " bill . Speaker Rayburn said he had not recognized Mr. Martin for that purposse . The House bill , originally scheduled for consideration yesterday , has been withheld until Tuesday to give the Senate a chance to make its decision first . The message went into detail regarding the difficulty , with various State laws , or lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress was told that a vast majority of the 11,000,000 members of the armed forces here and overseas could not vote for President , Vice President and members of Congress unless adequate legis ' lation was enacted , while thus far the only measure passed by either House was " meaningless " and only proved by its recommendations for amendment of State election laws the unworkability of existing State laws . " Our men can not understand why the fact that they are fighting should disqualify them from voting , " the message said . " The need for new legislation is evident if we are really sincere ? I and not merely rendering lip service to our soldiers and sailors . " It appeared to him , the President said , that the Green-Lucas and Worley bills would provide the machinery required through the distributions of the blank Federal ballot now , with identifications of the candidates to be sent by radio and wire to the armed forces after the conventions and primary elections . These measures , Mr. Roosevelt asserted , would not violate States ' rights " any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial majority of the Congress in September , 1942 , and which specifically provided that no member of the armed forces had to register or pay a poll tax in order to vote in a Federal election . " " It is no more violative of States ' rights , " he added , " than the Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act , iwhich the Congress passed In October . 1940 ? more than a year before the war began .
