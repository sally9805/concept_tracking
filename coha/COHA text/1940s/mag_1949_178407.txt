THE STORM ( 508 pp. ) - Ilya Ehrenburg - Gaer ( $3.50 ) . <P> In the ' 20s , when Paris was at its gayest and Novelist Ilya Ehrenburg took orders only from himself , he would sit hour after hour at a table in the Caf de la Rotonde . There he scribbled ironic novels needling Russian bureaucrats and told his friends he had become a complete skeptic . Then Ilya changed his mind , became a devout big wheel in Stalin 's propaganda machine . He was Russia 's No. 1 war correspondent , later wrote a war novel , The Storm , that pleased the Kremlin as much as his bitter assaults on the " decadent capitalist democracies . " <P> The Storm , published in the U.S. for the first time , has a little of everything : the fall of Paris , the defense of Stalingrad , the disintegration of the German army . But it is a dud compared to some of the panoramic novels that have preceded it , e.g. , Norman Mailer 's The Naked and the Dead and Theodor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is just another conventional multi-decker , patterned after the Europe-in-decay sagas of Jules Romains and Robert Briffault . By scraping off its party froth , a clever U.S. editor could fairly easily tailor it for his circulating-library customers . <P> Last Villains . The Storm has three kinds of characters : heroes , villains and Parisians . Heroes are usually laconic Red Army supermen : a soldier who is praised by his general and then wonders what was so exceptional about his heroism ; a tight-lipped officer who hears his sweetheart has been killed by the Germans and then , without saying a word , prepares to attack enemy positions . In real life there were , of course , plenty of Russian heroes , but they could not all have been such sententious prigs as Ehrenburg makes them seem . <P> Most of the villains are Germans : a brutal soldier called " Cockroach , " a jelly-spined anthropologist who begins by feeling superior to the barbarian Hitler and ends by dying miserably in the barbarian 's army . Toward Storm 's end there is a switch , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if they had just stepped out of a Daily Worker cartoon . Captain Mackhorn brags childishly about U.S. dollars ; Major Smiddle , defending segregation , asks a Russian if he 'd let his daughter marry " a man of an inferior race . " How these ninnies passed the I.Q. test to get into the Army , let alone O.C.S. , Ehrenburg does n't bother to explain . <P> First Love . Only when writing about Paris does Ehrenburg drop his didactic monotone and show some winning tenderness and gaiety . He seems honestly to love the Parisians ( " They could make a dead man laugh " ) and draws effective sketches of a collaborationist 's daughter who joins the underground , a scientist who suffers from the French disease of skepticism , a businessman who vacillates between Petain and his memories of Verdun . Paris ( " the lusterless enigmatic Seine . . . the lugubrious gaiety of the crowds " ) and not the Kremlin sounds like Ehrenburg 's first and true love . <P> Yet Ehrenburg never leaves his readers in doubt about who his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can hear the voice of Stalin day and night . " Ehrenburg writes as if he , too , never gets the voice out of his ears .
