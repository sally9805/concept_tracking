All U.S. imports were put in a strait jacket last week . Starting July 2 , practically nothing can be imported from anywhere without express authorization of the War Production Board . Primary and only ostensible purpose of the new order was to make sure that no precious shipping space is wasted on imports the U.S. can do without . Secondary but studiously unmentioned result is to give the Government an important new weapon of economic warfare . <P> In Washington there was not even a whisper about what the new order could do to recalcitrant Argentina . But everyone who wanted to look could see two interesting sidelights to U.S. import control : 1 ) agricultural Argentina has relatively little to export that the U.S. really needs ( mostly hides , flax , linseed oil ) , and of all good neighbors , she has the most that the U.S. can do without ; 2 ) Argentina also has an important merchant fleet of her own , has to that extent been independent of U.S. ships and control . With full U.S. priorities on imports , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she will have to use them for what the U.S. wants .
