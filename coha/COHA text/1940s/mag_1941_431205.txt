The greatest American inventors alive today are organizing a country-wide search for a secret weapon . It may come from a tiny workshop in a country lean-to . It may come from the benches of a great research laboratory . It may be the brain child of an already-famous scientist , or the ugly duckling of an unknown inventor . It may be the result of long , painstaking experiment , or the result of an accident . It may concern a rocket ship that will change all aviation ? or a cheap , light substitute for lead that can be as readily cast and as easily bent . To find that priceless idea ? to mobilize American genius in the development of all ideas that will make this country a more formidable adversary ? the United States Government has created the National Inventors ' Council . Its business is to stimulate , find , and appraise suggestions , ideas , and devices that may be useful in time of war To a greater extent than ever before , war has become a contest of inventors . Fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first war planes and the submarine blockade , has now become an accepted fact ; it is still so new that nobody yet knows what developments may change it completely . A single idea may bring victory to one side or another . That is where the National Inventors ' Council comes in . American inventive brains are recognized as the best in the world . Americans were the first to fly , first to build seagoing submarines , first to put armor on warships and change the navies of the world , first to put armor on automobiles and create modern tanks , first to " fix " nitrogen , first in mass-production methods . Every inventor in this country , amateur or professional , is being urged to send in to the Inventors ' Council whatever designs he  | has been experimenting with , whatever devices he has already worked out , that may be valuable from the standpoint of defense . One may have found a way to keep metal from heating rapidly , that can be used in the manufacture of rifle barrels . Possibly another knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscular strength in an emergency . The National Inventors ' Council , at the Chamber of Commerce Building , Washington , D. C. , can make them available for the whole country . The N.I.C . will not pay for ideas , nor have anything to do with their being patented . It has no connection with the United States Patent Office . Nor will it give advice as to whether or not an idea should be patented ; that is the sender 's business . But suggestions or devices found useful will be turned over to the Army or Navy , or whatever government department may decide to use them , and will then be negotiated or paid for in accordance with the regular custom and rate of that particular department . No suggestions will be considered that do not relate to defense . All suggestions must he in writing , in English , each one separate , supplemented by drawings if necessary . Senders are advised to keep duplicates of their suggestions , signed and dated , preferably in the presence of witnesses . Models , and materials of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forwarded to the Council only if requested . A certain amount of data is also necessary : Sender 's name and address . Is the suggestion in use , or merely an idea requiring further development ? Has it been patented ? Has a patent been applied for ? Is the sender the sole inventor ? Has he assigned any rights ? Is he acting as owner or agent ? Has the idea been divulged to any foreign government ? Nothing should be sent in that has already been submitted to any other government department . Ideas that state only objectives , instead of a means of accomplishing something , are not wanted . " A bomb that will follow an airplane around until it hits it " is no use to anybody unless the sender tells how it can be done . Also , ideas concerning things of which the sender is ignorant will , obviously , be worthless . A device that works all right on a table might be useless on the wave-swept deck of a battleship . Creators of ideas outside of their own lines of knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that field , whom they can trust , before submitting them . There is no time to be lost . Production of next year 's airplanes is already under way ;  | ideas that may be submitted now for improved planes , tanks , listening devices , explosives , guns or submarines can not get into production for months or years ahead . The idea of protecting automobiles with armor and mounting guns on them was already seven years old in 1914 , but the first tanks did not make their appearance in actual battle until near the close of the war . Before the armistice in 1918 , devices for the radio control of torpedoes and even aerial bombs were being experimented with , but they 're not perfected yet . A lot of people have realized the value of getting American genius to work in these days of world upheaval . Among those who discussed the matter last summer ere Lawrence Langner , prominent New York patent attorney , and his friend Thomas Midgely , inventor of ethyl gasoline . They went to Conway P. Coe , United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three of them went to Harry Hopkins , then Secretary of Commerce , and with the President 's approval e Inventors ' Council was hatched . Men outstanding ability and character , whose name and achievements alone inspire cononce , were called in . Charles F. Kettering accepted an appointment as Chairman . Commissioner Coe , Langner , Dr. Midgley , Dr. Fin Sparre , Orville Wright , Dr. William D. Coolidge , Dean Frederick Feiker , George Baekeland , Fred M. Zeder , Watson Davis , and Dean Webster N. Jones of Carnegie Tech agreed to serve with him . These dollar-a-year topnotchers are not merely a " front . " Each is the head of a technical subcommittee in the field of his own special knowledge . That means a lot of work . Two high-ranking officers are also serving with the council : Rear Admiral Harold C. Bowen , representing the Navy , and for the War Department , Major General J. O. Mauborgne , Chief Signal Officer of the Army since 1937 . If the danger of our going to war is finally averted , or if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other side , the Inventors ' Council may become a tremendous force for the advancement of civilization . Just as nitrogen can be used either for explosives or for fertilizer , nearly all devices suitable for war can be doubly effective for peace . Instead of using mosquito planes for dog-fights , we may be hopping into them , as we do into autos today , to visit the neighbors.  |
