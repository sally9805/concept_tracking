Soon , to each door in succession rolled a school bus . " Rusty , " the bus driver , marched in , picked up a small passenger , carried him to a seat in the bus . His passengers were going to Denver 's new School for Crippled Children . For many , it was their first school day . <P> Most crippled children never go to school , get their lessons from visiting teachers at home or hospital . The man who made Denver 's school possible was famed , 88-year-old Capitalist Charles Boettcher ( beet sugar , cement ) , whose grandson , Charles II , was kidnapped seven years ago , ransomed for $60,000 . The Boettcher family put up $193,000 , enabled Denver 's Board of Education to get a PWA grant and build a $384,000 school . Designed in pale green concrete and glass by famed Architect Burnham Hoyt , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U. S. <P> As pupils with canes , crutches , wheel chairs arrived at their new school at East 1 9th and Downing Streets , next to Denver 's Children 's Hospital , five teachers and a nurse ushered them in . The children sat in its red leather chairs , hobbled up its ramps ( just for exercise , the school had a few stairs to its observation tower ) , found handrails along every wall , adjustable chairs and tables , two lavatories , a drinking fountain and a grassy outdoor playground next to each classroom . Other equipment : arts &; crafts shops , sewing machines , two model kitchens . <P> A progressive school , the School for Crippled Children organized small classes from kindergarten through high school , planned to teach its pupils how to make a living . Because many a sensitive crippled child hates school hustle &; bustle , Denver 's teachers were not surprised that most of their school 's 250 seats were still empty the first week . But they expected that pupils would find the school such fun that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School for Crippled Children is free to Denver children , will admit out-of-town pupils for $300 a year . <P> Last week , as old Charles Boettcher took his daily stroll to work down 17th Street , Denverites stopped him in the street , warmly shook his hand .
