Medically , a man may be only as old as his arteries . But an airplane pilot has more complicated problems as he begins to get older . He has to worry about his " functional age . " Last week Psychologist Ross A. McFarland of Harvard 's School of Public Health told the Gerontological Society in Manhattan that a pilot is as old as his vision , or his " motor skill , " or his general ability to adjust to the demands of his job . No exact age limit should be set for pilot retirement , McFarland said , but life in the sky certainly does not begin at 40. * <P> If a time for retirement must be set for figuring pensions , McFarland suggests a sliding period somewhere between 45 and 55 . That age group , his study of military , commercial and private pilots shows , includes most of those who had trouble meeting physical requirements . <P> The most damaging effect of age on a pilot is trouble with his eyes . Only rarely is hearing poor enough to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry about , said McFarland , who is 47 : " The extent of the decline in such functions as ability to learn , memory , reasoning and judgment is much less than generally believed . " As long as the pilot had a good brain to start with , and his interest in his job continues , no " significant adverse trends in mental performance " should be expected up to 55 or 60 . As a " morale builder " for older fliers , he suggested creating the job of " command pilot " on larger planes ; command pilots would not have to meet active pilots ' strict physical standards . <P> In military aviation , McFarland found , accidents decline up through the 30-34 age group ; then there is a slight increase , and finally a better record after 40 . In general , " increasing experience makes the pilot safer " ; a 50-year-old pilot who is mentally and physically alert is " much safer " than a younger pilot of less intelligence and poorer coordination . Among transport pilots , lowest records for accidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate went up . Probably , thinks McFarland , the oldsters suffer from overconfidence . <P> No matter what a man does for a living , getting old may come to him one day as a terrible shock , Manhattan Geriatrist Martin Gumpert , 51 , told the gerontologists . " The recognition of aging , " Gumpert explained , " is perhaps the most profound shock of our life span-next to dying . " He advised patients to develop intellectual curiosity and independence , and " a well-cultivated faculty of giving up the old and assimilating the new . " Doctors , Gumpert said , should treat the " shock " of aging as carefully as any other form of shock . A patient who is getting on should be made to understand that he is no longer a stripling ; otherwise , the inevitable shock , when it does come , will be greater , perhaps disastrous . The patient , thinks Gumpert , should be told what he can do and can not do safely-and even ( if the doctor can guess ) how long he may expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make him live long and like it . <P> *Of 7,237 airlines pilots holding medical certificates from the CAA in 1946 , only 9.7% were 40 or over , 3.2% were 45 or over , 1.3% were 50 or over .
