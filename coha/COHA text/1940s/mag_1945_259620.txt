The old ghost town of Tombstone , Ariz , was having a minor boom . The boom was due to arthritis , asthma and sinus trouble , all of which are still medical mysteries . <P> The boom began last August , when Dr. Peter Paul Zinn , 52 , a onetime doctor for copper-mining Phelps Dodge Corp. , came over from Bisbee and started a medical center featuring inhalations of chlorine gas . <P> Man in the Mountain . Dr. Zinn got the idea from Father Roger Aull , 61-year-old retired Passionist priest who lives in the mountains near Silver City . Father Aull once had an abscessed lung which got well after chlorine treatments . Father Aull had studied medicine before entering the priesthood ; he bought a machine that would make safe , weak chlorine gas from salt water , and gave the treatments to others . In spite of clerical and medical criticism , he has been doing it for some ten years . Most doctors regard a chlorine treatment as hocuspocus : no one has explained how it can possibly act against disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until his own wife and mother-in-law , who had arthritis , were helped by Father Aull . Then he began to make careful before- &-after; bone and blood checkups on other Aull patients . Finally he was convinced . Dr. Zinn bought 14 chlorine machines , hired the abandoned Bank of Tombstone building . <P> People in Town . Nobody knows how big Tombstone was in the early ' 80s , when silver mining was at its height . Some say 12,000 . By 1940 , the population was down to 800 . The citizens mined a little , published the weekly Epitaph , lived mostly in the past , lolling against the boarded-up false fronts . A few were guides who showed visitors around the adobe Bird Cage Theater museum ( tour : 25 ) , a combined variety house , saloon , gambling house and brothel , where Sheriff John H. Behan and friends used to sit on the right and Marshal Wyatt Earp ( who wanted to be sheriff ) and his cohort sat on the left . <P> Nobody knows how big the town is now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but all the habitable houses are full and so are two new tourist courts with a capacity of 200 . Many arthritics , unable to find room in Tombstone , motor the 72 miles from Tucson or the 20-odd miles from Bisbee and Benson to take the treatment . The old Crystal Palace Bar is in full swing and sick people wander around visiting the site of the OK Corral and gawking at Million Dollar Stope , a caved-in mine near the middle of town . <P> The treatment is simple . Patients all sit around in one big room and breathe chlo rine from individual tubes , regulating the strength by moving the tubes to &; from their faces . People with arthritis and sinus trouble take it strong ( along with coughs , sneezes and watery eyes ) ; people with asthma get it mixed with oxygen . <P> Medical experts are dubious about the value of the Tombstone treatment , as far as the patients are concerned . But it has certainly revived Tombstone .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
