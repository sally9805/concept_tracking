txt The FBI and Civil Liberties Dr. Beard Seeks Senate Investigation of Some Recent Charges TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In his column of March 26 , Arthur Krock drew my name into his defense of Frank Murphy and J. Edgar Hoover against charges- of improprieties in office . So I venture to ask for a little space in which to coniment on Mr. Krock 's remarks about what he calls efforts to " smear " these gentlemen . Mr. Krock says that " the important charges " against Mr. Hoover " were quickly disproved , and the lighter insinuations reduced to their proper level . " Thus , with an airy touch , the whole business is dismissed as beneath the notice of intelligence . Now what are the important charges against Mr. Hoover ? f shall list a few Of them . 1 . Mr. Hoover is accused of setting up a political bureau in the Department of Justice not only for the detection of crime-but also for the purpose of indexing and spying upon persons charged with holding objectionable but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaging in activities of which he does not approve . Hoover Testimony Cited What is the basis of this charge ? It is partly the testimony of Mr. Hoover himself before the House Appropriations Committee on Nov. 30 , in which he stated that he had organized a " General Intelligence Division " in Washington for the purpose of indexing , among others , persons engaged in what he calls " subversive activities * * * or any activities that are possibly detrimental to the internal security of the United States . " Additional evidence respecting the probable nature of Mr. Hoover 's intentions arid methods is provided by the historical record which shows him operating as an official in the Department of Justice during the raids , persecutions and hounding of innocent persons in the days of A. Mitchell Palmer . Will Mr. Krock give the evidence showing that this charge has been dis-proved ? 2 . After arresting the alleged plotters of the Christian Front in Brooklyn last January , Mr. Hoover held them incomunicado and denied them access to counsel until after they were taken into court , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which leading journals called fantastic  --  stories  --  gravely injurious to men as yet convicted of no crime . For evidence , any one can consult the extensive accounts of the affair in the New York press , including THE TIMES . Will Mr. Krock give the evidence showing that this charge has been dis-proved ? 3 . In February , 1940 , the FBI , of which Mr. Hoover is head , raided the homes of persons in Detroit at an early morning hour ; arrested ten persons accused of having aided in the enrollment of volunteers for Loyalist Spain , held them incomunicado for more than nine hours , and denied them that free access to counsel which is a constitutional privilege of the worst criminal . For evidence , see " FBI Detroit , " with a foreword by Dr. Henry Hitt Crane , pastor of the Central Methodist Church in Detroit . Will Mr. Krock give the evidence showing that this charge has been dis-proved ? 4 . Mr. Hoover has in some cases engaged in wire-tapping , although , the Communications Act forbids it in interstate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the press as of March 13 , and the report of the Attorney General on March 17 to the effect that he had ordered wire-tapping stopped by the FBI . Will Mr. Krock give evidence showing that this charge has been disproved ? Murphy Position Questioned In one respect Mr. Krock is right . I did highly praise Mr , Murphy 's speeches on civil liberty . I now want to know whether his actions as Attorney General squared with his noble words . Is it true that Mr. Murphy deliberately and personally singled out Detroit and started action against a few persons accused of aiding in the business of recruiting soldiers for Spain ? If so , on what ground did he , at so late , a day , attack just these persons in a single city , when it was notorious that recruiting had been going on all over the country ? As Attorney General Jackson properly said in dismissing the charges : " Unless we are to proceed with all the cases arising during that period ( 1936 , 1937 and 1938 ) , it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is distressing to me to find Mr. Krock apparently treating all criticism of Mr. Hoover as unworthy in motive , as springing from the love of " smear . " Surely he must believe in the bottom of his heart that , with the frightful example of what has happened to civil liberty in Europe before us , we should err , if at all , on the side of emphasizing too much , rather than too , little , the rights of persons under the law . Even a little unintentional injustice to Mr. Hoover would not be as bad for the decencies of American life as a revival of the A. Mitchell Palmer outrages by the new " General Intelligence Division . " With another war threatened , the Judiciary Committee of the United States Senate should investigate the FBI before Mr. Hoover begins to round - up progressives and other independent citizens as " possibly detrimental to the internal security of the United States . " CHARLES A. BEARD . New Milford , Conn. , March 29 , 1940 . Mr. Krock Replies To THE EDITOR OF THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " we should err , if at all , on the side of emphasizing too much rather than too little the rights of persons under the law " ; and r think I have reflected this viewpoint constantly as well as recently . I was unaware that Dr. Beard has ceased to hold the high opinion of Mr. Murphy 's public Performances which he expressed in his eulogistic introduction to the pamphlet containing the justice 's speeches , " In Defense of Democracy . " ( " He has patiently observed the precepts which he expounds. * * * He has suffered abuse without resorting to re- crimination , " etc . ) Had I known this , I should not have mentioned the eminent historian in the article to which , he takes exception . Answering his specific questions as to J. Edgar Hoover : 1 . The President by executive order and himself used the phrase " subversive of Sept. .6 , 1939 , directed this activit , activities . " Also the Budget Bureau approved the appropriation and so dic both branches of Congress . Mr. Hoover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were arrested at 9 P. M. Saturday and there- ; 1 fore could not be arraigned next day . ) All arrests were made on Federal war- , rants , and fifteen bombs were found in the house of one of those arrested . 3 . None of those arrested in Detroit asked for counsel until about 1:30 P. M. , 1 I am advised , and they then had access ' to counsel prior to their arraignment. ; I presume they were arrested in thei early morning because that was the ; best time to round them up . It is not ' necessary to approve these arrests ' lc : defend Mr. Hoover from the general ? attack that has been made on him . 4 . The records disclose that Mr.1 Hoover was the first Federal official to ; oppose wire-tapping , in 1928 , and he has ! never in court used evidence so gath-i. ered . After the Supreme Court decision in the Nordoni case he asked his superiors for a ruling and was informed thee wire-tapping. to obtain leads on criminality was not banned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attorney General Jackson , and I am in-i formed that Mr. Hoover conformed to ; instructions in both instances . I do n't think such criticism as Dr. ' Beard 's comes under the head of " smearing . " He is a patriotic and a ; wise champion of democracy . But I do ' know there has been " smearing , " and Ia do think the important charges /level been disproved . ARTHUR KROCK . Washington , April 2 , 1940 . Real Directors Advocated Corporation Boards , It Is Held , Should Actively Control Business TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The thought that corporate directors , should really direct , expressed last year . by Justice Douglas , then chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission , and more recently put into some-. what more concrete form by Richard C. Patterson Jr. , in an article in THE NEW YORK TIMES Magazine and in a speech . at the Harvard School of Business , goes to the root of a situation badly needing reform . The theory of the democratic process as applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneficial owners of the enterprise , after due deliberation , select representatives quailfied by training , experience , ability and , character as directors , who , in that capacity , rule the destinies of the corporation . The theory is based on two assumptions , one of which is usually , and the other often , false in practice . Ordinarily the selection of directors is not a free choice by the stockholders , based purely on merit , but a cut-anddried ratification of a list of names chosen , in fact , by the management of the corporation . Too often the proceedings of the board ; itself are equally cut and dried , and are nothing more or less than the ratifica- ' tion of a fait accompli by the manage- : ment , which , in theory , is under the or- : ders of the board , but which , in fact , ' issues orders to it . The obvious cure for this condition seems to be to go back to the demo- ' cratic theory of corporate organization , in actual practice  --  to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " by the stockholders of their background and to insist that boards of directors ' really exercise their own judgment and , ; in fact , direct the affairs of the cor- ; poration . The first branch of this cure is ; touched on in Mr. Patterson 's articlei and speech . The second is considered ? at length , and in the " creed " for directors which he has prepared is given-a concrete form which , while placed on , : a high plane , is by no means imprac. : , ticably high . A logical corollary of placing real in- , stead of merely nominal duties upon , directors would seem to be the payment= of real and not merely nominal compen- " : sation for their work as directors . This ; corollary Mr. Patterson advocates . The public discussion which has been given to this subject is timely and fortunateand should lead to a sound solution of this difficult problem . PETER GRrm-ra . New York , April 1 , 1940 . Bishop McConnell Not ' Assailed ' To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of , March 31 , dealing with the Emergencyl ; Conference to Save Spanish Refugees , / was essentially correct but erred in serting that speakers criticized Bishop Francis J. McConnell , chairman of the Spanish Refugee Relief Campaign . Not a single speaker at the conferences " assailed " Bishop McConnell . There has never been any question concerning the sincerity of his interest in the welfare of the Spanish refugees . It should also be pointed out that nine6 members of the national executive boardi who endorsed the conference are still members of that body . The story incor-1 rectly stated they " withdrew recently , " K and refers to three of them who spoke at the conference as " former members . " ? JOSEPHINE TRUSLOW ADAMS , GEORGE R. STARR .
