The Allies think they are finding a way to win the war . <P> Axis strategy has been to divide enemy forces and demolish them fragment by fragment . Allied strategy , which became obvious the moment the Americas fell into the war , is to prevent any further division . The Allies , possessing the great land masses of the world and the great sea bastions between them , must temper their chain and let no link be broken . Then , with unified , coordinated action , they must use the chain to beat the enemy down . <P> Fittingly enough , the strategy of unity was first proposed by the first victim of Axis aggression , China . In Chungking Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek last week suggested the immediate formation of an Allied High Command . Britain responded by directing General Sir Archibald Wavell to further British cooperation with China . Anthony Eden flew to Moscow to find out exactly how far Russia would go in joint action . In London and Washington both military and civil authorities of all the Allied nations conferred . President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very nicely . <P> This week 's activity apparently resulted in a decision to hold a conference of Allied powers in Washington to be attended by highest officials of participating Governments . <P> The Allies ' front line now encircles the globe . It is hinged on a half dozen great naval fortresses : Britain , Gibraltar , Suez , Singapore , Pearl Harbor , Panama . These fortresses are the key points in the Allies ' mobility , vitally necessary if the Allies are to continue helping each other fight on farflung battlefields . By breaking any two of those key points ( see below ) , the Axis could virtually cut hemisphere from hemisphere . <P> If the Allies are to win the war , they must not only defend their strongholds ; they must , sooner or later , attack Axis power in such a way that it is no longer capable of threatening the strongholds . <P> This will call for consummate timing . Priorities of effort will have to be assigned . Each ally will have to sacrifice a modicum of its own advantage for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great statesmanship . But they must be arranged for victory .
