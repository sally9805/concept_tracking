txt I am quoting from THE NEW YORK TIMES of June 18 : " House upholds rent rule , 163 to 73 ... " House sustains President Truman 's tax veto , 268 to 137 . " On the basis of these figures , the following is noteworthyi On the same day one bill ( tax veto ) records 405 votes , 93 per cent of the full membership ; one bill ( rent ) , only 236 , 54 per cent of the membership . One must conclude that the bosses can and do compel the attendance and the votes of members when the bosses wish to do so . In other words , they can and do prevent members from dodging their duties and responsibilities ; those members who , for reasons of their own , fear or can not stand tip and he counted , as in the case of the rent bill . The record on these two bills alone justifies the designation so often applied to many of our legislators : rubber stamps . An affirmative vote of 163 men decided the rent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent of the membership . Can that be called an example of democracy ?
