After Allied bombers got through with Milan 's famed La Scala in August 1943 , all that was left was the stage and four walls . Last week La Scala had been put back together again ( at a cost of $350,000 that a lot of Italians felt could have been better spent on bread and shelter ) . To its reconstructed podium stepped little , white-haired Arturo Toscanini , 79 , who had scored some of his greatest triumphs there . <P> Toscanini , voluntary exile from Italy since 1938 , had flown to Italy at his own expense , to conduct six concerts without pay . He had obviously been homesick for his native land , but when he got to his family home in the green Po Valley , he soon seemed homesick for the U.S. He sighed to friends of New York 's climate and California 's wines , and whispered wistfully over a dish of spaghetti : " But you should taste the spaghetti in the United States . " <P> When Toscanini entered rebuilt La Scala for the first time , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an echo came loudly from the rebuilt dome . " Yes , " the maestro said , " it is the same . " The no-piece orchestra was not quite the same at first ; Toscanini drilled them firmly , but with none of his usual wrathful outbursts . On opening night they played as they had not for years . Toscanini had chosen an all-Italian program ( Rossini , Verdi , Puccini ) of the kind of kettledrum-banging bravado that he likes . When he played Verdi 's Te Deum , the audience got to its feet and shouted enthusiastically . <P> Most of the 3,600 people in the audience were U.S. or British officials , or rich Italians who had paid scalpers up to $100 a seat . But outside , in the public squares , more than 10,000 Milanese heard Toscanini 's music over loudspeakers , stayed to argue about it for most of the night . Many of them wanted for bread ; but for a night they had their circus .               @ @ @ @ @ @
