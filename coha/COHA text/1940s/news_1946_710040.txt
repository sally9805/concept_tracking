txt Edward P. Terry , former private secretary to Senator Theodore G. Bilbo , Democrat , of Mississippi , was held in contempt today by the Senate War Investigating subcommittee before which he was testifying . The ruling came when he refused to disclose the names of individuals in New York City from whom he said he had received $15,000 to use against Mr. Bilbo in the Mississippi Democratic primary last spring . Senator James M. Mead , Democrat , of New York , chairman of the subcommittee , likewise announced that a transcript of Mr. Terry 's testimony , in which he was alleged to have committed perjury , would be transmitted to the Attorney General for possible criminal action . Mr. Terry had previously requested the committee to excuse him from appearance , on the ground that the lives of himself , his wife and his daughter would be endangered if he testified publicly . He had previously appeared before the committee in executive session . Questioned About $15,000 When he appeared today in response to the subcommittee 's subpoena , he was accompanied by Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preliminary skirmishing , in which Mr. Dillon tried unsuccessfully to establish that a private secretary 's relation with his employer is in the same privileged category as that of a priest , a doctor , or a lawyer , Mr. Terry testified fully and freely about many matters concerning Mr. Bilbo . When Senator Homer Ferguson , Republican of Michigan , began to question him about an item of $15,000 which had been found in the records of his bank account at Jackson , Miss. , he balked . His attorney maintained that $15,000 item had nothing to do with Senator Bilbo , or with war contracts , and that the committee had no right to question him about it . After this plea was overruled , Terry reluctantly told the story of having received the money in September , 1945 , in cash , from Simon Liberman , of 1133 Fifth Avenue , New York City . He ' said it was to be used , along with another $10,000 Mr. Liberman agreed to supply , to promote the candidacy of Governor Tom Bailey of Mississippi against Mr. Bilbo in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once Soviet Adviser Mr. Liberman , who died last Jan. 5 , was a former leader of the Spcial Democratic party in Russia , where he was born . After the revolution of 1917 , he stayed on as business adviser to the Soviet Government until 1926 . He came to the United States in 1938 , and was naturalized about a year ago . Last autumn , a book of his called " Building Lenin 's Russia " was published by the University of Chicago Press . The publisher described him as " the only capitalist in the Kremlin in the early days of the Soviet regime . " Mr. Terry admitted that he was still Mr. Bilbo 's secretary at the time he took the money and entered into the plan to help Governor Bailey as his employer 's opponent . However , Governor Bailey finally , decided he was not in sufficiently good health to make the race . By that time , Mr. Terry had resigned his position with Senator Bilbo . He tried to get Walter Sellers , Speaker of the Legislature , to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that " the people " in New York told him to keep the money to back whatever candidate ran against Mr. Bilbo in the run-off . There were five candidates in the first primary , but Mr. Bilbo won a clear majority over the other four and no second election was necessary . He was certified as the nominee of the Democratic party , which is tantamount to election in Mississippi . Money Returned , Says Terry Being unable to put the money to its intended use , Mr. Terry told the subcommittee , he withdrew $15,000 in cash from his bank - in Jackson on July 16 , 1946 , and returned it . He added , in reply to questions from Mr. Ferguson , that there were no written records of the transactions nor any witnesses when Mr. Liberman handed him the money or when he returned it to Mr. Liberman . At this point , the subcommittee took a short recess . When it resumed the hearing , Mr. Ferguson brought out by questioning that Mr. Liberman had been a lumber dealer in France as a member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that the late Senator Pat Harrison of Mississippi had helped Mr. Liberman get into the United States . Mr. Ferguson then attacked Mr. Terry 's earlier testimony in which he left the impression he had repaid the $15,000 to Mr. Liberman in July , 1946 . Mr. Ferguson had learned , during the recess , that Mr. Liberman died last January . Mr. Terry said he had been confused , and had meant to say he had given it back to " the people . " Mr. Ferguson asked him to identify the individuals to whom he referred . It was when he said that " I wo n't involve other people " that Mr. Mead and Mr. Ferguson held him in contempt . Before the impasse was reached Mr. Terry identified A. B. Friend , one of the contractors who built Key Field at Meridian , Miss. , and twice a campaign manager for Senator Bilbo , as the man who threatened his life . He told the subcommittee that Mr. Friend had told him , at dinner at the Lamar Hotel in Meridian in the early part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part in this campaign or tell what you know of Senator Bilbo you 'll be killed . " Warned Later , Witness Testifies Two additional warnings came from an unidentified speaker over the telephone on subsequent occasions , Mr. Terry said .. Mr. Ferguson asked him if he now feared bodily harm . " I do for my family , " he replied . " As far as I am concerned , it does n't matter to me . " He added that his wife was staying in Washington and that his daughter was in Mexico . Mr. Terry told the subcommittee that Senator Bilbo had told him , about July 14 , 1940 , it was agreed that the $3,000 loan from Abraham L. Shushan of New Orleans was not to be paid back if Senator Bilbo was able to help Mr. Shushan in his difficulties with the Federal Government . The Shushan loan was made in 1939 , according to yesterday 's testimony , and . the money was used to make up the $21,000 divorce settlement made with Senator Bilbo 's former wife . At that time Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he settled for around $120,000 . In 1940 Mr. Shushan was charged with mail fraud . Mr. Terry said today that he recalled going with Senator Bilbo to the Department of Justice to see a Mr. , whom he described as Assistant Attorney General at the time and as a Federal judge now on Mr. Shushan 's behalf . Mr. called in a Mr. Rogge , who had charge of the case in New Orleans , and Mr. Rogge told the Senator nothing could be done to help Mr. Shushan . Senator Is Quoted Mr. Terry also told the subcommittee that Senator Bilbo expected the expenses of his primary campaign in 1940 to be reimbursed to him by the contractors who have been mentioned during the present hearings . On one occasion , Mr. Terry testified , at breakfast in the Senate Office building , the Senator told him : " Be calm , do n't say anything to these boys until they get well on the way with their contracts . " At this time Mr. Friend was participating in the construction of Key Field . F. T. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with the construction of Keesler Army air base near Biloxi . As Mr. Terry pictured his post with Senator Bilbo , it was no sinecure . He said he worked fourteen to sixteen hours a clay , either in Washington or at Mr. Bilbo 's campaign headquarters in Jackson . He paid out money for office and campaign expenses and had great difficulty getting it back . On several occasions , he said , he threatened to resign , as " I was out a lot of money and working myself to death . " As time went on , he testified , the contractors began to come forward with financial help . On occasion the money would be sent through Forrest B. Jackson , Mr. Bilbo 's , attorney . Testifies He Was Repaid He estimated he had spent about $4,350 for.Mr . Bilbo 's account t ' durino. his employment , but added that it had all been paid back to him from one source or another except possibly an amount of ! ; ; 500 , of which he was not sure . Mr. Terry said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had not paid but he was ready to pay back . Mr. Newton , recalled to the stand , said he could not remember the transaction . Mr. Newton 's contracting firm is now in bankruptcy . " The bankruptcy court will certainly be glad to learn he owes me , " Mr. Newton observed . A similar amount of $3,750 received from Mr. Knost , Mr. Terry said , was in payment of a gambling debt , and should have been $5,000 . The witness told of being treated in Vicksburg by Dr. A. J. Podesta . He said the doctor told him , during his stay there , that a drug addict named Carr had given him $1,500 to pay Senator- Bilbo to secure from Dr. Anschlinger , of the Bureau of Narcotics in Washington , a permit by which the addict 's doctor could prescribe drugs for him .

At the testimony about the alleged drug deal , however , he flushed angrily and whispered to his attorney . At the first break Mr. Jackson requested , on Senator Bilbo 's behalf , that the subcommittee ? subpoena Dr. Podesta to appear with al* his records regarding Mr. Terry 's treatment and care . Senator Mead agreed to take the request under advisement.
