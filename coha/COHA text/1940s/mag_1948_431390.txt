 | Sixty-five years ago next February 13 Richard Wagner died . In these sixty-five years ( with the exception of two seasons during the first World War ) his operas have never been absent from our opera houses . Only Beethoven outranks him in concert popularity . Not only is his music popular , but the man is still so newsworthy that after-dinner controversies about him are possible . Thousands of copies of his most recent biography , the great work by Ernest Newman , published in four huge volumes , have been sold . Hitler cited Wagner 's scriptures for his own purposes , so that in this past war Wagner became a ghostly but nonetheless dangerous Nazi ally . Did this do Wagner 's music any harm ? How do people feel about him today ? And what does he , the murky philosopher , mean to those people who , though they like his music , have no desire to study or probe it , considering music only entertainment ? We must attempt to answer these questions three ways . Usually a biography consists of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more complex , must be sketched in a triple picture : the man , the theorist , and the musician . As to the man , we probably know more about Wagner than we do about any other composer . For he was from the start thoroughly conscious of his importance . Wagner believed , long before he had any real right to , that he was destined for a top position that would make him immortal . Therefore , he minutely recorded , for posterity , all the details of his life . I happen to own an important letter of Wagner 's . I bought it many years ago , with practically the first spare money I had . This letter , more than a thousand words long , was written when Wagner was twentyeight and living in Paris . He was so poor that he a 11 ' 111 had to give up even the few pupils he had manage to find ; he could n't scrape together enough money fc carfare or for having his shoes mended , so he couldn walk to his lessons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embossed with an elaborat crest and his monogram . In the letter he begs , it pleads with the Dresden stage director to use his ir-fluence to have Rienzi performed . It is the epistle c : a desperate man ; but when Wagner wrote it , he probably thought it would be preserved and would someday be worth something , so the stationery had to h durable . Everybody knows that Wagner was not a mod ' for schoolboys . that he could be petulant , prejudiced , rude , dishonest , despotic . Some people belie , that , had he lived in our time , he would have bee . a Nazi . This I doubt very much , for , in spite of h : - Germanity ? or should I say Ger-mania ? ? his min was too universal , too broad , too humorous . Be:g what difference does it make now ? Wagner 's cha acter and his views on subjects other than music a matters that ended February 13 sixty-five years ag As his music , with its tenderness and love , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today of purely anecdotal interest . But here he ran : - high in fascination . Indeed , a true Life of Wayne contains more entertainment than many novels . Fc here is a real character , more daringly contradictor ; more intense in good and evil , than most characte , conceived by novelists . Wagner believed the won owed him a living . Failing to obtain this living unt King Ludwig II went to his rescue , he borrowed u : : - scrupulously and promiscuously . If anybody refuse : . he was promptly banished , for was it not a privile to give money to Richard @#  | Wagner ? He used this money not only for the necessities of life but for almost Oriental luxuries ? satin wall hangings . handmade underwear , velvet housecoats. liberal supplies of champagne and perfume ? which were to him necessities . Yet he need not have been oppressed by debts . He could have earned money had he been willing to continue to compose successful operas like Rienzi instead of the " impossible " works he created . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performances of his operas . But this he would not , he could not , do . For in music he was completely and uncompromisingly the idealist . He was passionately fond of reading aloud to his friends . As soon as his poems were finished , he had to have an audience . Let anybody be absent from these reading sessions , even for a good cause ? as happened once when a friend 's child was sick ? Wagner was furious . But let things go well , there was no end to his charm . his graciousness as a host , his love of fun , and the ebullience of his discourse , which might range from vivisection to Shakespeare . His mental and physical forces ? which , in spite of adverse conditions and frequent sickness , sustained him so he might create his masterpieces ? were equally amazing . When he was fifty-eight years old , he would stand on his head or climb up a tree just to show off his good spirits . Though he was not handsome ? he had a large head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was small ? he cast a spell over women almost to his dying day . And his heedless , frantic love affairs are one reason people read biographies of him and shake their heads in amazement . WAGNER the theorist is something else again . As a philosopher he is not to be taken seriously . As an author he is dreary . As a reformer he was limited . He wished to use the theatre as an instrument of education and moral uplift . He wanted to create a folk theatre in which the myths and sagas of the people would be portrayed in noble form . The plain people , of whom ( in theory ) he was so fond , were to be the new , breathlessly attentive audience in this theatre . But he learned that tickets to expensive entertainments have to be priced high , and that people do not go to the theatre or opera house for education , but for amusement . His failure is wider than the cleavage between the ideal and the practical . for he conceived everything in only one way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art . He had absolutely no understanding of anything that would not fit in his scheme . He dismissed Verdi 's work contemptuously . He thought Mendelssohn merely a salon composer . As for the music of Brahms ? his dislike for the man blinded him to any virtue in the music . He saw all art as a mystic allegory . His philosophy was largely balderdash . But now we come to his music , and here is the third part of the man , the enduring and infinitely valuable part . His music is completely alive today . Of the thirteen operas , eight are still sure-fire attractions . His vast popularity is still growing . It grows in direct proportion to the interest in all music . Why ? Because there are nobody and nothing like Wagner for the great emotion and the melting mood . There is @#  | hardly an emotion , indeed there is hardly a human situation , that has not found beautiful expression in his music . When he makes Siegfried climb the mountain to awaken Brunnhilde , he takes us in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ god through the loud and eerie flickering of fire to a sunlight that is silent and wonderful . He is such a magician that he can put before us a play in which virtually nothing happens , and yet we do n't care , we just want to go on listening . Wagner can show us with equal conviction the death of a whole world and a holiday dance of a few apprentices . Sometimes the philosopher gets in the way ; he talks too much . But during these occasional stretches we are willing to coast along , because we know that around the corner , after Wotan gets through telling the story of his life , which we already know , we are to hear some of the most overwhelming love music that ever has been sounded . OUR relation to Wagner 's music has undergone a certain change . Remember that it has been popular for a long time . It was hotly debated and viciously attacked during his lifetime , but even then it fascinated people . As long ago as sixtyfour years , in the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's was played , and New York underwent a Wagnerian craze of high intensity . At that time and for some time afterward , you had to be introduced into the mysteries of the Wagnerian drama ; you had to study the music and the philosophy behind it , and particularly you had to learn the names of the motives from which his symphonic web is spun . If you did n't know what was the sword motive and what the fealty motive , you were an ignoramus . This analytical game has ceased . Today most of the millions of people who listen to Wagner 's music can not tell one motive from another . They are moved by the music as a whole , by its poetry and its power . This is as it should be , of course , for all music must stand on its own feet without explanatory crutches . Today Wagner is a favorite composer among children . They like his fairy tales and his exciting sounds . I wonder what he would say if he knew that his music , which baffled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of young people ! For young and old , the Metropolitan Opera this year is restudying and restaging the entire Ring ? Das Rheingold , Siegfried , Die Walkiire , and Gotterdammerung . You will have an opportunity to listen to some of it over the air . Liszt called Wagner a Vesuvius . You will be able to convince yourself anew that this volcano , though he brought forth some slag , still flames with the most glorious fire .
