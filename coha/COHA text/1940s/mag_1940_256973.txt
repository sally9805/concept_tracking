Three weeks ago , when Baseball Tsar Kenesaw Mountain Landis freed 91 players from Detroit ( TIME , Jan. 29 ) , rival major-league club owners let 90 of these uncaged Tiger cubs amble back to cover , but put out hell-for-leather after the gist : 22-year-old Benny McCoy . <P> Benny was scarcely three months old in the major leagues , but his batting average ( .302 ) in the 55 games he had played with the Tigers convinced most observers that he was the McCoy himself . Within 24 hours of his freedom , Rookie McCoy had bids from ten major-league clubs . Washington offered him a bonus of $20,000 to become a Senator . The Giants hiked it to $25,000 , the Dodgers to $35,000 , the Pirates and Reds to $40,000 . <P> Last week , much-sought-after Benny McCoy ( who got $15 for his first season in organized baseball and thought his $5,000 last year was big money ) proved he could count . He accepted the Philadelphia Athletics ' offer : a $45,000 bonus , a two-year contract at $10,000 a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye of old Cornelius McGillicuddy ( Connie Mack ) . His was not only the biggest bonus in baseball history ( $20,000 more than the previous top , given Rick Ferrell by the Browns in 1929 ) , but it made Rookie McCoy the highest-paid baseballer of the year . His 1940 income of $55,000 will be more than the salary of Joe Di Maggio , Jimmy Foxx or Hank Greenberg .
