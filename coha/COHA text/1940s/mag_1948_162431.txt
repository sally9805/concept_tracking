THE PATCHWORK TIME ( 323 pp. ) - Robert Gibbons-Knopf ( $3 ) . <P> <P> This is the story of an Alabama town named Pineboro , a place of " tasseled pink-shaded livingroom lamps and bare kitchen bulbs . " <P> Its major achievement is that Robert Gibbons makes his overdrawn characters credible . He has a sharp eye for the commonplaces of small-town life , a good ear for common speech , an unsparing fidelity in recording the stupidities and the brutalities of the townspeople . The imagination revealed in his characterizations , the lopsided half-caricatures that still talk a recognizable native language , indicate an emerging talent of the first importance . The defects in the book are consequently all the more glaring . <P> Its leading characters are Johnny Somers , history teacher ; Crow Johnson , a hard-eyed , mean , man-about-Pineboro ; Bill Boone , onetime football star ; and Blackie Boone , his wife- " ask anybody in Fillmore about her . " The portraits have the hard authenticity of those notices that are put up in post offices of people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspects in Author Gibbons ' police lineup , blinking in the limelight , not quite sure of what they are charged with . <P> Mistrust . What they are charged with is ( among other things ) a lack of faith . They all have the same insincerity , the same distrust of anyone else 's sincerity . They have the same raw ambition , the same bitter kiss-my-foot contempt for each other . They all have the same childish fretfulness of mind . <P> The trouble with the first 50 pages ( and with the book ) is Johnny Somers , the sole exception to the pattern . Johnny , the hero , is 21 , shy , inexperienced , friendly , the sort of person to whom good-natured drunks confide their life histories , because he is too reticent to relate his own , too sympathetic to shut them up , and too polite to razz them . Like Eugene Gant in Look Homeward , Angel ! and like a thousand other intellectuals in American fiction , he thinks in a scrambled poetic prose-The memory of her face had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Bill Boone and his wife enter the story they run off with it . Bill is short , stocky , cocky , with " a good-looking squarish face , " now somewhat puffy , always getting in fights , which he always loses . He is an expert with dice , and has a pathetic eagerness for a respectable job that makes him vulnerable to his wife 's malice . Bill is dragged out of a bar , sobered up , and hired as Pineboro 's only salaried fireman . Some day he plans to be fire chief . The turn of the screw is that his brother-in-law ( who has seduced Bill 's good-looking wife ) merely wanted to ruin Bill once &; for all . With stupefying smalltown cunning , he calculated that some day Bill would be drunk when there was a fire . <P> His wife Blackie is as amoral as Bill , but far more intelligent , moving from Bill to his brother-in-law , from a happily married man to Johnny Somers , and from innocent Somers to a rural Machiavellian , Crow Johnson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or rejoicing in such gothic scenes as an embrace beside a corpse .
