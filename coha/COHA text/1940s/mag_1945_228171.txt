Some visitors to Manhattan 's slick Museum of Modern Art have been amused , annoyed or otherwise aroused by some contraptions made of tin , wire , roots , glass , cardboard and broken oddments , teetering , swaying , jiggling and bobbing in the breeze . These " mobiles , " along with " stabiles " which do n't jiggle , have been Alexander ( " Sandy " ) Calder 's principal claim to artistic fame . <P> Some like them but do n't think they 're art ; others concede they might be art but do n't want any . A few have paid from $50 to $1,200 to take one home . <P> Not seen so often are Calder 's paintings - once his chief interest . Last week in Manhattan 20 new paintings by Calder went on display . <P> They were big , ebullient abstractions done in black &; white and bright poster colors . Far less baffling than Calder 's mobiles , they included hodgepodge silhouEttes of shapes , plus moons and melted creatures reminiscent of Joan Miro , and echoes of Picasso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they had a kind of damn-it-all gaiety all their own .
