txt Chester C. Davis , Food AcirninibtLator , announced today an immediate advance of 5 cents a bushel hi the ceiling price of feed corn , increase of the recently announced support price for live hogs from $13.25 per hundredweight to $13.75 and plans to import feed from Canada and Australia . He warned that procedures for placing ceiling prices on hogs were being worked out in case the support price program plus slaughtering restrictions and meat rationing did not reduce the price from its present level of nearly $16 a hundred pounds to the $14.25 to $14.50 required to place it in accord with the ceiling prices on pork . It was emphasized that hog ceilings were- still strictly on an " if and when " basis . Concerning live cattle prices , it was stated that administrative problems did not permit quick action on them , but that alternative methods of establishing effective readjustment were being considered in case existing measures did not bring them down to a level commensurate with the ceilings on beef .

The cuts range from 14 to 50 per cent and become effective tomorrow night . Livestock Hard to Grade The Agriculture Department and the Office of Price Administration have been reluctant to impose price ceilings on livestock and have been criticized for it . The reason for the reluctance is that , while it is easy to grade meat ; it is difficult to grade hogs before , they are slaughtered and almost impossible to grade live cattle . The agencies expect to be driven to trying it eventually in obedience to the President 's anti-inflation order , but , as one official remarked today : " The trouble caused by our failure to put ceilings on livestock will be as nothing compared with the trouble that will ensue when we nave to impose them . " The 5 cents a bushel increase in corn prices will increase the price to $1.07 per bushel on a Chicago basis . Under the former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 and , as a result , producers have been holding their corn .

Seizures Threatened , Feed will also be imported in sufficient volume from Canada and Australia to supplement supplies from the Northeastern , Southeastern and Southwestern corn areas and , if necessary , outstanding corn loans in tins country will be called . If these measures did not make available sufficient supplies of corn for immediate industrial requirements , including the making of ' alcohol , present commercial stocks of corn would be requisitioned for use by essential war industries , Mr. Davis announced . Mr. Davis advised hog producers not to increase breeding for 1943 Fall farrowings by more than 15 per cent above last year 's level .

Self-grading , it was stated , had led to serious abuses as rising prices of livestock had put pressure on ceiling , prices of dressed meat . Today 's OPA action led to speculation whether it would institute grade labeling for canned goods , which has long been a bone of contention littween its officials and the canning industry . Pressure on Labeling The House today adopted a resolution authorizing an investigation of policy of the OPA and the C. I. 0 . ' s United Automobile Workers , the American Association of University Women , the National Council of Catholic Women and a dozen other labor , consumer and women 's organizations telegraphed to the OPA demanding either - that it establish grade labeling or fix one standard price for each product at the standard grade of that product .

A delegation of eighteen members of the National Agricultural Mobilization Committee , which represents farmers not belonging to the " big four " farm organizations , strengthened the hand of Price Administrator Prentiss Brown today when they pledged their support to keep farm prices stable . The delegation , which was headed by Ralph Brown of Ohio , contended that its committee , which was organized at a recent meeting in Des Moines , represented the views of the majority of American farmers . The membership of the Nation Grange , the National Farmers ' Union , the American Farm Bureau Federation and the National Cooperative Council , it said , comprised only a minority . Other Actions on Food Other developments on the food front today included the following : The Department of Agriculture removed restrictions on the sale of milk in. less-than-quart size containers for consumption in factories , schools , offices , on playgrounds and similar places ; prohibited stores , restaurants , hotels and similar establishments from refusing delivery of milk or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to return milk or cream already delivered to them ; liberalized the requirement of deposits- on bottles used in the home delivery trade where the requirement would effect no economy , and exempted rural areas and incorporated places of less than 5,000 population from all the restrictions of the order . The WPB announced that thirtytwo Rural Electrification Administration projects which it stopped last July had been reinstated to provide electric service to 6,700 farms and materially increase the production of ? such critical food products as dairy items , poultry and meat . The cost of the projects will be $2,600,000 and the construction will involve 2,861 miles of line . The board also enabled farmers eligible for electric cutility connections to obtain necessary materials for " on-the-farm " wiring by a simple certification . Further , it summoned seventeen Industry Advisory **25;143;TOOLONG various segments of the agricultural implement industry to meet in Washington between April 12 and 27 " to make recommendations and assist in planning for the proper integration of their industry in the over-all food , production program .

The OPA pointed out that producers and distributors , of rationed meats - and fats at all trade levels would enter the second phase ' of the new rationing program in the coming week . The House Small Business Committee accused the OFA of having " for many months flagrantly violated the clear and unmistakable mandate of the Congress that normal channels and functions of distribution must be maintained and that nothing shall be done to prevent their survival .
