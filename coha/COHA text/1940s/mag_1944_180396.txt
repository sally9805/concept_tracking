But the use of beef blood is not new : doctors have long known that it could replace human blood plasma-if every trace of certain beef substances poisonous to man were removed . <P> Last autumn a U.S. blood expert , Julian Herman Lewis , announced that he had made beef plasma safe by treating it with alkali . Last week 's real news was that Dr. F. Ronald Edwards of the University of Liverpool has figured out a way to purify it with heat . If one of these methods can be used for mass production , the plasma supply will be almost limitless-a 1,000-Ib. steer is 7% blood . <P> Research to find a substitute for human plasma does not stop with beef blood . Some substitutes that work : coconut milk , casein , isinglass ( fish gelatin ) , pectin . But doctors still reserve their real enthusiasm for safe human plasma or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood plasma by a newly perfected process . The albumin goes six times as far as an equivalent amount of plasma , is now being made for use by para troopers , small naval units , other troops with little room for luggage .
