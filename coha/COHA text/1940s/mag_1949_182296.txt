THE PRICE IS RIGHT ( 316 pp. ) - Jerome Weidman-Harcourf , Brace ( $3 ) . <P> Nobody can roast tiger ( two-legged , money-hungry variety ) with the searing yellow flame that Jerome Weidman uses . In his first novel , I Can Get It For You Wholesale , and a sequel , Weidman barbecued some of the pin-striped denizens of Manhattan 's garment district . In his latest ( and sixth ) novel , the tiger wears tweeds and its hunting grounds are the knotty-pine fastnesses of a Madison Avenue newspaper syndicate ; but when the price is right , the beast still shows its breed . <P> Henry Cade was pushing 30 , apparently only mildly restless in his second-drawer job at Vinnaver &; Jaxon . Then he got his break : the syndicate rights to a rising young columnist named Wally Pohl . In return for the rights to " Pohl 's Apart , " V. &; J. made Henry a full partner . Then Henry realized that " you could no more want a little success than you could want a little love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> The story of how Henry went after everything and got nothing wears such a high polish that readers may scarcely realize it is essentially an old shoe : the same kind of satiric article Frederic Wakeman tried to fit on the advertising business in The Hucksters . Weidman 's is the better fit . His boardroom oratory and office memoranda strike the ear with just the right sound of bursting fruit , and he can nail his types with the deftness of a bartender spearing a cherry with a toothpick . Says one of his newspaper executives , nodding toward his wife and suggesting another round of drinks : " I have an old beat-up legman here , or legwoman , rather , who helps me with odds and ends around the house , such as bearing children , finding collar buttons , and making drinks for guests . How about it ? " <P> Parallel with the satire in The Price Is Right , Weidman tries something bigger ; he appears to offer Henry Cade as a sort of modern Macbeth , a surrogate for all men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains strictly from Madison Avenue , and one side of the street at that .
