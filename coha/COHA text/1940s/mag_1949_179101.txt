Nebraska became the first state to abolish rent ceilings under the new federal rent-control law . The one-house legislature last week passed the law over the veto of Governor Val Peterson , who was against rent control too , but wanted it to last until April i , 1950 to avoid the hardship of rent boosts and evictions during the rugged Nebraska winter . The new law left landlords free to charge whatever rents they please after Nov. i for the 91,000 houses and apartments in Nebraska that are now under federal controls .
