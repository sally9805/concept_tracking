" Personally , " said Edgar Bergen , " I never thought entertainment so damn important , but I changed my mind after we toured the Army posts in Alaska . " Like Al Jolson before him , he declared the boys up there had taken the zest out of him for entertaining civilians . Last week they were backed up by Bob Hope , the hardest-traveling Army-camp trooper of them all . The Aleutian circuit , he declared , comprised the greatest audience in the world . Back home , both Bergen and Hope were geysers of zestful anecdote in proof of their claim . <P> Booked for a six-day tour and 25-minute shows , Bergen &; friends Charlie McCarthy and Mortimer Snerd stayed twelve days , did 51 shows of 45 minutes each . At Dutch Harbor , where Charlie got the biggest laugh , he gave 13 straight shows . " Hello , stinky , " Charlie would chirp from inside his floppy sheeplined coat &; hat , and Bergen would reprimand him for his discourtesy to men in uniform . Thereupon Charlie would crack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That was enough to split the sides of the soldiers . But what really spilled them into the aisles was Charlie 's comment as an unidentified plane zoomed overhead : " Here they come , fellows , " cracked Charlie , " those yellow-belly bastards . I 'll mow ' em down ! " Posing behind an advanced gun emplacement , Charlie observed : " I ca n't see any Japs , but I can smell ' em ! " <P> Bob Hope , who flew 16,000 miles on his Alaska junket , took along Jerry ( " Mustache " ) Colonna and Singer Frances Langford . " They never went rough on Frances , " he said . " But a few of them took a look at her and wept in their hands . " He added : " I guess you can take care of sex with saltpeter . But you ca n't keep a man from reading his mother into any girl who shows up in a spot like that . " <P> The only thing bigger than the troops ' appreciation of entertainment , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of an Alaska private he had known in Los Angeles . The general arranged for them to meet in his office . " My friend walked into the general 's headquarters , " said Bob , " and before he even saluted he stooped down and felt one of the few rugs in Alaska , and said : ' Gee ! a rug . ' Then he straightened up and said , ' Hello , General . ' " In Alaska , declared Hope , superbly disciplined privates and respected generals " all live the same life , and no one is sirred or saluted to death . " <P> " And , boy , " reminisced Hope , " are they quick on the trigger . " Once , toward the end of an all-night show , he propagandized his soldier audience : " The United States needs you . " Quick as a wink , a voice shot back : " We need the United States . " Hope had no comeback to that one .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
