txt There are two distinct aspects of the meat problem : the adequacy of total supply and the distribution of that supply among civilians . Recent programs have been directed mainly to a solution of the first problem . The Vinson program , however , does attempt to improve the distribution by shifting some Government orders to plants located away from large consuming centers . While this measure will help somewhat , it does not go far enough . The separation of meat rationing from other products is required . The House Food Investigating Committee , Mayor La Guardia and Senator Taft are among those who have called for this change . In this connection Price Administrator Bowles testified recently : We thought about it last year , but we did not want to face the red tape , and grocers were all opposed to it . We did not think it would help any . We thought it would introduce new complications . It is a very compelling idea to every person when he first looks at it . It is also a very compelling idea upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only country in the world which has combined meat , butter , fats , cheese and canned fish in a single rationing system . If Mr. Bowles ' argument of red tape were a valid one , it would follow that different ration coupons should ' not be used for sugar and canned goods , or for coffee when that was rationed . OPA argued in support of the adoption of the combined ration that " in dealing with the production of meats and fats we do not have two distinct supplies but a single total or overall supply , which is , to some extent , divided into meats and fats according to the conditions of demand . " By this test , fuel oil and gasoline should also be rationed together . As can be seen from this analogy , there is nothing intrinsically good or bad about a combined ration . The proper system depends upon the products involved . Major products such as meats and fats should be rationed separately . Important reasons for this separation include better price control and a fairer distribution of available supplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notorious . It is bad enough when people pay above ceiling prices for supplies in excess of the allotted ration . But to be forced to pay above price ceilings for items bought with coupons is a national scandal . Under an appropriate rationing system , such price ceiling evasion could be substantially reduced because the consumer would have no incentive to pay illegal prices . Since meat is now combined with other products , there obviously are more coupons which can be used to buy meat than there is meat. - Thus if any community buys more than its share of meat , other communities will get less ? and New York City is in the latter category . One important factor determining whether an area receives more than its share is the relative prices set . Price instead of ration coupons directs the flow of supplies . Under these conditions some people do not obtain their fair share . Although a change in the rationing system would not , be a cure-all for the maldistribution of meat , it would help to improve a bad situation .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
