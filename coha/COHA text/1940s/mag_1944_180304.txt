Shocking headlines announced last week that Chase National Bank , the nation 's biggest , had been indicted under the 26-year-old Trading with the Enemy Act . The details were less appalling . In 1940 , under authority of the act , President Roosevelt froze the U.S. funds of all citizens of nations invaded by the Axis . Chase 's alleged offense was that it had allowed a refugee Dutch diamond merchant named Leonard J. A. Smit* to withdraw $264,000 from his accounts . Smit , it was charged , had then proceeded to buy industrial diamonds for sale to Japan and Axis-dominated countries . <P> The Department of Justice conceded that Chase had been persuaded to " unfreeze " Smit 's funds on his representation that his companies were actually British , not Dutch . But the bank , said the Department , later had both time and opportunity to learn that Smit was not telling the truth . In reply , the bank cited the enormous job of meticulously checking the 45,500 applications it has received since April 1940 to unfreeze accounts . Cried Chase Chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense . . . . All the acts complained of happened before Pearl Harbor . . . . The indictment alleges that the bank conspired to aid the Axis . This is ridiculous . . . . " The bank pleaded not guilty , and prepared to fight . <P> Attorney General Francis Biddle hailed the indictment as " shutting off one of the worst leaks of strategic materials . . . to the enemy . " But what mystified many a plain citizen , as well as financier , was : Why had the Justice Department waited two years to plug the " worst leak ? " <P> <P> * Not to be confused with J. K. Smit &; Sons , Inc. , one of the world 's greatest industrial diamond companies . Leonard J. A. Smit is no relation , nor has he any connection with the company .
