" Here 's a pretty state of things ! Here 's a pretty how-de-do ! " - The Mikado . <P> There were so many reporters ( 300-odd ) scrambling around the battleship Missouri in Tokyo harbor last week that they spilled over their assigned space on the ship 's deck . Dozens of the U.S. newsmen were looking for Joe Blow , the local boy who made good . Aboard one destroyer transport , the squawk box ordered all New York men to double to the fo'c'sle to meet the New York Times 's representative . He turned out to be the Times 's general manager himself , Brigadier General Julius Ochs Adler . Lesser reporters , many with the names of their papers lettered on their uniforms hunted down boys from their home towns . <P> Ashore , U.S. photographers crouched side by side with Domei 's lensmen , shooting the big shots . One Domei cameraman had carrier pigeons to fly his pictures back to his office . U.S. and Jap reporters elbowed each other at press conferences . Jap reporters obligingly gave out interviews , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they agree that the bombing of Japanese cities was horrible ? ) The U.P . came up with an eyewitness description of atom-bombed Hiroshima from its onetime Tokyo office manager , Honolulu-born Leslie Nakashima , who went there to look up his mother . Wrote he : " I was dumfounded at the destruction before me . The center of the city . . . was razed and there was a sweeping view to the foot of the mountains . ... I found my mother safe . She had been weeding grass in a field about two miles southeast of the city when she saw the flash . . . threw herself face down on the ground . " <P> American reporters went into Tokyo ahead of the U.S. Army , simply taking a suburban train like thousands of other commuters . ( Said an obliging fellow from the Jap Information Bureau : " When young gentlemen wish go Tokyo ? Trains every half hour . " ) They dropped in at Domei , looked over the busy newsroom , were photographed chatting with the editors . A woman guide ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . She said she was n't Tokyo Rose : that was two other girls from Los Angeles . At the Imperial Palace one newsman got as far as the Emperor 's foreign secretary , who told him politely that Hirohito was not yet accessible for interviews . <P> Domei continued to pour out propaganda stories , one of them accusing U.S. soldiers of raping Jap girls . At week 's end , U.S. reporters discovered that Domei , far from being put out of business , had signed an agreement with the Chinese Central News Agency to transmit its news to China on the regular Domei propaganda broadcast . <P> Newsmen trying to find their bearings in the topsy-turvy world were reminded of another key to the Japanese in The Mikado : <P> " Our attitude 's queer and quaint-you 're wrong if you think it ai n't , oh ! "
