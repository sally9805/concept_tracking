Some churchmen cheered when the Supreme Court ruled ( Si ) for Agnostic Vashti McCollum in her suit against religious education on school property ( TIME , March 22 ) . Others , however , were not so sure there was anything to cheer about . Among them were 28 top Protestant leaders , including Bishops Angus Dun and William Scarlett , and Reverends Reinhold Niebuhr , Harry Emerson Fosdick , Henry P. Van Dusen and Douglas Horton . They issued a statement deploring the Supreme Court decision , believed that it would " greatly accelerate the trend toward the secularization of our culture . " In the current issue of Christianity and Crisis , Professor John C. Bennett of Union Theological Seminary tells where he thinks the significance of the McCollum and other high court decisions really lies . Writes Bennett : <P> " As a nation we are moving from the idea that the State should be neutral as between the churches or religious faiths , to the idea that the State should be neutral as between all positive forms of religion on the one side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> " The one common form of aggressive secularism ... is the tendency to make the institutions and assumptions of American democracy into a religious faith or into a substitute for religious faith . . . So , gradually we may find ourselves a nation in which the conviction-forming agencies of all sorts which are aided by the State will count against rather than for religious faith . That would be the opposite of the intention of many who have contributed to the result , including those Protestants who fail to discern the full meaning of the current interpretation of the Constitution .
