 | The Mystery of John L. Lewis Condensed from Common Sense Victor Riesel and Paul Sann THE NAME is Lewis ? John L. " Thus the miners ' leader once announced himself to an NRA caring board . An earlier John L. , named Sullivan , always added , " and I can lick any alive . " John L. Lewis does n't waste breath on such idle bragging . He believes it is implicit in his case . He is disdainful of all criticism . His reaction to a recent Fortune Survey of Public Opinion is typical . The question was , " Are there any prominent individuals in this country who you feel might be harmful to its future unless they are curbed ? " And 70.6 percent of those who thought there were such harmful individuals named John L. Lewis as their No. i choice . Fortune concluded somberly : " It is possible that a big group of people regard Lewis much as they regard Hitler . " Lewis , lolling in an overstuffed leather chair before the huge fireplace in his office in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we referred to it . He said he did n't care what the world outside the UMW thought of him ? and this was during the fourth wartime coal strike , when the " world outside " was in full cry against him . When it was pointed out that newspapers everywhere were denouncing him as a fascist , that American soldiers overseas were calling him a traitor , Lewis was n't disturbed . He smiled , and asked , " What fascism is involved in trying to get $2 a day for the miners ? " John L. Lewis ? combining remarkable self-assurance with a very thick skin ? was standing pat on his demands . The public be damned ; his miners were for him . It has been so ever since the very beginnings of his power , when he led the 1919 coal strike . That November , the nation 's fuel supply was so low that Detroit closed its schools for lack of heat , Pittsburgh trolley cars were stalled for want of power , and factory owners everywhere were warning of impending mass layoffs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would yield to pressure  | and call off the strike . They expected to find him surrounded by lieutenants , busily outlining his strategy . They found him quite alone , reading Homer 's Iliad . The same unfailing serenity marked the man in the recent crisis . Steel plant blast furnaces were being shut down . People faced a very uncomfortable winter because strikes had cut coal production by 4o , ooo , ooo tons . But John L. Lewis talked to us about the Bible and Shakespeare . Why not ? The miners were for him . Then he recounted some of the things he had done for the miners . His union had pioneercd the eighthour day , the sliding wage scale , government regulation of industry ( the Lewis-inspired Guffey Act 's Bituminous Coal Commission ) . His union 's gold , under his dispensation , had organized the unorganized into the CIO , turning a slumbering labor movement of 3 , ooo , ooo into a powerful force of 12,0oo , o0o ( if only the boys could get together ) . He , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and automobile industries . What care he for sticks and stones ? In the past 24 years , Lewis has won every national strike he has called . He has never agreed to a lowered wage scale . He has never yielded a major point to the operators . This last detail is important . In a crisis he deals not with the nation 's coal operators but with its Presidents . Woodrow Wilson settled the 1919 strike ? " We are not yielding to the operators ; we are yielding to the greatest government on earth , " Lewis said . Calvin Coolidge had to deal with Lewis in the 1925 strike . And now Franklin D. Roosevelt has acquiesced in a pay increase which exceeded the Administration 's preciously guarded Little Steel wage ceiling . No other labor leader employs this lofty strategy . It is gambling for high stakes , but Lewis can take chances . The Government ca n't . Coal is the nation 's prime need in war or peace ? and Lewis is coal . Few in the United States will dig coal without his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal judge issued an injunction ordering the miners back into the pits . Lewis , ever the one to comply with the law , publicly " called off " the strike . The next day , not a single miner went back to work . The men knew what Lewis wanted . John L. points proudly to the fact that 530 , ooo men quit work on November 1 ? last of the 1943 strikes ? without any communication from UMW national or district headquarters . In July the men had been told not to work November 1 unless a contract had been signed by that time . No reminder was necessary . This discipline is not at all a measure of the miners ' devotion to Lewis personally . It reflects their devotion to their union ; their solid belief in collective action , a belief grounded in more blood and sweat than any other labor group has had to expend to better its lot . They follow Lewis because Lewis is the union . His own explanation varies from this view . The men , he told the writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pledge to them ; they know he will never sell them out . As a stern critic of his once said , " John is interested in collecting power , not in  | selling it . " Even his enemies grant that his word has been good . When he told the Government that he would send his men back on such a date , he did so . When he pledged industrialists that there would be peace in the coal fields , there was peace . When he promised to cooperate with the Communists ? his traditional antagonists ? in the initial CIO drive , he went down the line with them . When Lewis took office in 192o miners were earning $18 a week . Now they come closer to $55 . They are no longer clay pigeons for imported company thugs and coal-town deputy sheriffs . With improved safety regulations they have a better chance of coming out of a mine alive . In 1925 two miners were killed daily and " 6o were carried home on stretchers , " in Lewis 's words . Today , despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and the daily toll of injured is 25 . Lewis kept the union alive through the depression , when unemployment stripped its dues-paying membership from 3oo , ooo to 115 , ooo . He fathered NRA 's section 7A , that made collective bargaining the law of the land and paved the way for Lewis ? gambling the last $75 , ooo in the UMW treasury on a whirlwind membership drive ? to hike his rolls up to 515,0oo . Lewis cherishes the prestige deriving from such illustrious deeds . When he starts out to get $2 a day for the miners he brushes aside all other considerations . The editorial writers , the columnists , the polls , yes , even the boys in the foxholes , just do n't matter . The $2 a day matters because the $2 a day is continuing prestige . Those who view Lewis 's power with alarm often attack him as a menace . Lewis turns such attacks to his own advantage . Menace , is he ? Well , when he walks into a room to negotiate a contract , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the limitless daring and insatiable ambition with which his detractors cloak him . Add to this his fearful countenance , his flowing gray mane and over-publicized brows , his complete command of the utterly crushing Biblical reference or Shakespearean quotation , his perfect sense of the dramatic ? and you have John L. Lewis not only as the cartoonists see him but as the men on the other side of the table see him . Lewis , as a two-fisted bargainer , couples this stock-in-trade with his " crust of bread " formula . It has served him splendidly , time after time . Witness this incident from the 1925 anthracite strike : President Coolidge ordered Secretary of Labor James J. Davis to bring together Lewis and Sam Warriner , the obdurate mine boss . Davis inveigled Warriner from his seat at a Thanksgiving Day football game at Philadelphia . The peace session got under way in a nearby hotel . " All I ask , " Lewis began , " is a few dollars for my people . All I want is a stale crust of bread for every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crust of bread to celebrate Thanksgiving . " Before Lewis was through Warriner yielded . " I knew I should n't have seen that man , " he told Davis . " He can argue water from a stone . " Last March , Lewis strolled majestically into a wage conference at the Hotel Biltmore in New York and  | his first words were , " The coal miners of America are hungry . " He went on , coupling his crust-of-bread device with an assault on the Roosevelt Administration . " When the mine workers ' children cry for bread , they can not be satisfied with a Little Steel formula . When illness strikes them , they can not be cured with an antiinflation dissertation . " The crust-of-bread formula may have its ludicrous aspects , coming from an impeccably tailored , barrelbellied gourmet flourishing a Havana cigar . It may sound trite on the tongue of a labor leader who drags down $25 , ooo a year in pay and another $25,000 in expenses ( " The miners , " says Lewis , " pay me to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter what occupation 1 chose to pursue " ) . And talk of miserable miners ' shacks may sound a trifle insincere from a man who occupies one of the finest colonial homes in Alexandria ; sends John L. , Jr. , to an exclusive Virginia prep school and then to Princeton and Johns Hopkins ; smiles benignly on daughter Kathryn 's buying of costly antiques . But behind the colonial mansion ? way , way behind it ? is a ramshackle cottage in the Lucas , Iowa , miners ' patch where John Llewellyn Lewis was born in 188o . And behind his chauffeured limousine is the open-top coal car from which John , as a boy . pilfered coal to keep his family warm . Lewis 's father and mother were from : poor Welsh mining families . Lewis attended high school in Des Moines until he had to quit and go to work as a pick-and-shovel miner With five sons , the Lewis family needed extra dollars so desperately that for a time Mrs. Lewis herself worked by her husband 's side . Lewis saw his father die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he took to the road , working in numerous states . In 111inois he became active in the miners ' union . In 19o9 the Illinois miners chose him as their legislative representative . He quickly prevailed upon the state legislature to pass several miners ' safety laws , including a workmen 's compensation act . His prestige rose steadily and in 1916 he was chairman pro tern of the UMW 's national convention . The machine Lewis immediately built up won him the UMW vicepresidency in 1917 , and when the union 's president fell ill Lewis took the helm to lead the 1919 strike . He won a 27 percent wage increase , largest in UMW history . The following year he was elected president by the biggest vote on record . Despite the opulence developed during his years in the UMW saddle , Lewis has n't forgotten : He dug coal I1 hours a day for $1.6o . He helped carry out the crushed and twisted bodies of 4oo men killed in the big 19o5 cave-in . He saw his family 's livelihood imperiled when his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least-known side of John L. Lewis 's tumultuous life ? the part played by Myrta Edith Bell , the gentle , retiring schoolteacher whom he married in 19o7 . Few know of the infinite , almost childlike devotion Lewis lavished upon her , nor of the prodigious influence which this woman , Quaker and daughter of a country doctor , exerted over him . When Lewis met her in Lucas , he  | was a six-foot miner , rough and aimless , who prided himself on having floored a mule with one blow of his fist . Myrta Bell weaned him away from the dime novels which , weary from the day 's labors , he had taken to reading . She guided him in a self- education so monumental that he can now say he has " read tens of thousands of books , everything worth reading in biography , history , the classics , even the books people are talking about currently . " She encouraged his interest in labor and political affairs . She coached him in public speaking . He leaned heavily on her advice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did n't ? " Mrs. Lewis was n't interested , " he told reporters . Once he was offered a post as czar of the coal industry at a fabulous salary ? " Mrs. Lewis was n't interested . " President Coolidge offered him a Cabinet post as Secretary of Labor ? " Mrs. Lewis was n't interested . " Lewis dropped out of public life almost entirely in 1942 because of his wife 's fatal illness . Not even the one big public incident he figured in during that year ? the violent final break in his 3o-year friendship with Philip Murray ? could keep him from her bedside long . That 's the tender , considerate John L. Lewis . The public knows an implacable , relentless , untiring Lewis . And rival labor leaders dwell on the Lewis of the silver-tongued rejoin-ders : Leaving the AFL , he tells William Green , " Your lament is that I will not join you in a policy of anxious inertia . I am temperamentally incapable of sitting down with you in sackcloth and ashes , endlessly intoning , 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. Hurley at a wage hearing , he excoriates this old friend and ex-mule driver as a " Judas who betrayed the union of his youth for 3o pieces of lousy silver. : When a bitterly protesting Hurley demands an apology , he turns to the official reporters and says , " All right , strike out lousy . ' " He sits down with the nation 's . President , or a board chairman of its largest trust , U. S. Steel , and deals with them in a manner so imperious as to proclaim that his power is at least as great as theirs . He does n't come into the presence of the mighty ? political or industrial ? hat in hand . He does n't ask ; he demands . When he put up $5oo , ooo of UMW money to help re-elect President Roosevelt in 1936 it was because a friendly Roosevelt could do the miners some good . He was n't interested in the broader fact of Mr. Roosevelt 's liberal economic and social philosophy . Nor was he impelled by any highflown motives when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money behind the CIO 's drive to organize the unskilled in America 's mass-production industries . He did it out of a firm conviction that labor 's stake lay in forming itself into an organization that could wield tremendous political and economic power ; power to put friendly administrations in office ; power to forestall such disasters as befell the unions in the depression years . This ability to make bold and imaginative moves has turned Lewis into labor 's biggest egotist ? and one whom the nation most fears as a potential troublemaker ,
