For three months , a U.N . Commission has cooled its heels in Seoul , trying to arrange a national election and dodging Communist snipers . The Russians had flatly refused to admit the commission into Korea 's Russian-occupied northern zone . Exasperated , the U.S. finally decided to schedule for May an election of its own in Korea 's U.S.-occupied southern half . The Communist radio in northern Korea promptly denounced this as an imperialist plot to split Korea , called for financial contributions to support a " merciless and fierce " guerrilla campaign against the Americans . " This way , " said one Communist broadcast , " the blood-boiling , brotherly sympathy and devotion of the people of North Korea ... is blooming . . . . " <P> Last week , the blood-boiling sympathy bloomed even brighter . Along the border between the U.S. and the Soviet zones , Russian soldiers were digging trenches . The Communists called a convention for April 14 , to form a " Korean People 's Republic , " i.e. , an all-Korean Communist regime . Anybody was welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans or the free elections they proposed to conduct . U.S. occupation authorities did not restrain any Korean politicians who wanted to accept the invitation . Said one U.S. spokesman : " It might be a good thing for them to go north and find out for themselves how the Soviets operate on the home grounds . " <P> Chief among the politicians invited was Kim Koo , Rightist chairman of the Korean Independence Party . Few party-liners were prepared for this proposed alliance . On the day the Communists issued their invitation , Manhattan 's Daily Worker referred to Kim as " the notorious old terrorist Kim Koo who is without any following among the people . . . . "
