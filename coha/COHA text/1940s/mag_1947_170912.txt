" If we can continue to spread the benefits of a constantly increasing productivity in the U.S. , we can go on to economic and cultural heights as far-and farther-above those of today as those of 1947 are beyond the imaginings of our great-grandfathers back in 1840 . " <P> These measured words last week introduced a highly optimistic and monumental ( 500,000-word ) report on the U.S. economy ( America 's Needs and Resources ) by the Twentieth Century Fund . Probably the most comprehensive ever made on the subject , the study was completed last week-when some optimism was sorely needed-after three and a half years of fulltime work by a staff of 27 economic experts . <P> Chief of the staff was conservative , scholarly Dr. James Frederic Dewhurst , 52 , ex-professor and onetime head of economic research for the Department of Commerce . The report 's most important conclusion is that the U.S. , for the first time , is close to having the tools , workers and know-how to nil the basic needs of its population . This hopeful prospect is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal long-term trends of U.S. growth-in population , wealth , consumption , demand , spending , etc. , and the assumption that the U.S. will not be plunged into a catastrophic depression or war . <P> Plenty of Elbow Room . Unlike " mature school " economists , the Twentieth Century report finds that there is plenty of room for dynamic expansion in the U.S. economy . Thus the report estimates that in 1950 57,000,000 will be employed . They will be working fewer hours ( an average of 41 a week ) to produce a gross national product of $177 billion ( in terms of 1944 prices ) - nearly double the best prewar year . The U.S. economy will then be short only some 13% in goods &; services of maintaining the entire population at a satisfactory standard of living . By 1960 , some 60,200,000 people will be working an average of 38 hours a week to turn out goods &; services worth $202 billion . <P> These estimates are based on demand and not need , between which the report draws a sharp distinction . " Witness the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pie to a better-balanced diet . Too many of us drink milk dutifully , but highballs gladly . " If the U.S. were to try to supply all needs ( minimum standards of health and decency for everyone ) as well as all demands ( all the goods which the wealthier want to purchase ) , then the estimates would have to be raised . The U.S. would have to turn out goods &; services worth $200 billion by 1950 and $219 billion by 1960 . <P> Plenty of Elbow Grease . The key to whether the U.S. will reach these goals is productivity-the combination of labor efficiency and technological improvement . A startling example of what improvement in productivity means : national output in 1940 was 27 times larger than in 1850 , though the labor force was only nine times greater and worked only 43 hours a week instead of 70 . If such productivity continues its average rate of growth since 1850 ( 18% a decade ) , the U.S. will easily meet the estimated demands for 1950-60 . If it grows at the rate which prevailed in. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would nearly meet estimated needs as well .
