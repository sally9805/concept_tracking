" In addition , the realization of an inward call and his own will to take upon himself the responsibility weighed with the statesman Adolf Hitler when he resolved to be his own generalissimo . <P> " The course of this war has more &; more confirmed recognition of this fact , but it was fully shown only when the campaign in the east assumed proportions which exceeded all past notions . . . . " Adolf Hitler was doubtless concerned by the turn of events in Russia . <P> At worst , he may have feared that his Army , suffering simultaneously the numbing sensations of cold and defeat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least , he could not forget that it was not the State but the Imperial German Army which , in 1918 , decided that enough was enough . Adolf Hitler would never have enough . <P> Like Hitler 's appeal to his people through the voice of Joseph Goebbels ( see p. 2j ) , Hitler 's appeal to his men on assuming his new command showed the full measure of his uneasiness . <P> He said : " Germany 's battle is now approaching its culminating and turning point . " He alluded to Japan as a " comrade in arms " and said : " The present war is now entering upon a new and favorable stage for us . " Because of the sudden onset of winter , he said , the armies in Russia must now be brought from " mobile progress into a stationary front . " Adolf Hitler 's Army was on the defensive . So was he .
