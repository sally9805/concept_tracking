 | The most important key to understanding personality is the fact that every human being begins in infancy to form a mental picture of himself . From birth the baby gathers impressions about how important or unimportant he is and what he can or can not do . These impressions make up his mental image , which he believes to be a true one . Simple illustrations are the boy who has been nagged and scolded and so often called a bad boy that he accepts the role , and the girl who has been so much praised that she becomes unbearably prissy . Such mental pictures are as imperfect as the self-portrait of an unskilled man . But what is psychologically significant is that the individual feels that his mental image correctly depicts him . This inaccurate picture is called the Ego . Its importance can not be overexaggerated , for every individual tends to play the part of the person he thinks he is . The Ego explains behavior . There are four basic Ego patterns , which we call Nero , Clinging Vine , Star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Four cases , taken from life , will illustrate these typical personalities . Mrs. Nero is a puzzle to those who know her ? and , at times , to herself . People are charmed with her friendliness . As a hostess she displays unusual tact and graciousness . By pleasing tactics and thoughtfulness she always wins her guests . But when the last one has gone home , she often sheds her graciousness with her party gown and becomes an exacting , faultfinding person , storming at her husband and threatening to spank her young son . Her club activities were typical . As long as she was striving to become president , she was sweet to everyone . She went out of her way to ask for the most timid woman 's opinion and to act upon it . After she was elected , however , she began to reign as a monarch , deciding everything herself . Strangely enough , she did not realize how her behavior had changed until the members openly rebelled . Then she was startled and indignant and , apparently for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered uncomfortably if she might not be a Jekyll and Hyde . Mrs. N. is not mentally sick or even unusual . To understand her personality , we must have a reasonably clear insight into her Ego . To do this , we must go back to the experiences of her earliest years . She was the oldest child in a rather large family . Her father , disappointed because she was not a boy , showed her little attention , especially in comparison with the affection he lavished on her brother , born when she was seven . Also , he was a stern disciplinarian . Her mother was a rather weak person , who did so little for her daughter that the child felt that she , too , was estranged . But soon the girl learned to bully her . The child felt that both parents were against her ; but she could get her way with one of them . These family experiences Mrs. N. could not , as a child , analyze . She was in an unfriendly world and must get her way by controlling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early feelings into her adult years ? though not everyone does ? which explains the strange inconsistencies of her adult behavior . Back of her tyranny at home and her charm abroad is a common purpose , unconsciously born of her feeling about the kind of person she is and what she can do . That purpose is to have her own way . So she bullies her husband and son , and is ingratiating to her club associates because as a child she had found that she sometimes could win favor by being nice . Nero personalities do not all act alike , of course . A small boy who dashes a broken toy to the floor betrays his Neroistic attitude . A schoolgirl may lack interest in subjects in which good grades seem doubtful , because she wishes to dominate . An extremely capable man might like to become a political leader , but , Nerolike , refusing to occupy an inferior position , he can not make the humble beginning necessary . An attractive woman may refuse many offers of marriage , ostensibly for good reasons , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to marry a man she can not dominate . The Clinging Vine Ego is illustrated by a man who happens to be Mrs. N. 's brother . Though professionally capable , he made a bad first impression because of his retiring bearing . His closest friends said that he wore the pants in the family all right , but his wife told him which pair to wear . Because of his outstanding position in his profession , he was often asked to head committees or take other responsibilities . But it was hard to get him to serve , as he found it uncomfortable and difficult to make decisions . When he was about forty he had trouble with his wife , which brought on a nervous breakdown . His friends could not understand how a man who had tried to please everybody could not get on with his wife . It might be supposed that Mr. C. V. would have much the same personality as his older sister , Mrs. Nero , because of similar heredity and environment . Actually he did not have the same environment . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her Nero pattern of superiority . Moreover , he was the pet of his mother , who pampered and spoiled him . So the boy felt helpless and incapable compared to his father and sister , because they were demanding , strict , and seemingly mer-@#  | ciless in their discipline . From his mother he learned to cling to someone for protection and the satisfaction of his needs and wishes . Thus , as a boy , he had , without being aware of it , formed a false mental picture of himself . His timid bearing reflected his inner sense of helplessness ; his troubles were due to his indecisiveness and dependence . His wife was somewhat like his sister . And his Clinging Vine tendencies made it possible for him to live comfortably with her as long as he could satisfy her love for power and dominance by being obedient and submissive . But one day she wanted him to become aggressive , to protect her against someone who threatened her rule . And he could not . He suffered cruelly before he realized that she protected him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clinging Vine , truly without a tree , straightaway had a nervous breakdown , which secured again the attention and succor he needed . Many persons develop this type of Ego . A Clinging Vine child becomes expert in the use of suffering to win sympathy and get his way . Yet this is no deliberate trick . Whenever he feels afraid , looks pale , starts crying , some soft-hearted helper rescues him ? first his mother , then the teacher , later an older friend . As a man , when debts press too hard , he relies upon a pitiful hard-luck story to extricate himself . Mr. Star represents another familiar Ego pattern . He is a middle- aged man , who occupies an influential place in his community . Often he is asked to head committees ? because of his ability and also , as those who know him well realize , because he is jealous of his prestige and , if slighted , becomes deeply offended and antagonistic . Once a newcomer , wishing to organize a Scout Council , did not ask Mr. S. to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. S. opposed it , saying the time was not ripe . Two months later , however , he himself promoted successfully a similar campaign . Of course , Mr. S. has accumulated many enemies . The things they say about him , their indifference , their ability to ( Continued on page 95 ) @#  | outwit him disturb him greatly . Outwardly he is serene ; but inwardly he is full of misgivings and fear that his reputation will suffer . Mr. S. was the only child of doting parents and the only boy in the families of several aunts and uncles . Admiration and attention were lavished on him . Such a person develops a Star Ego and acts as if he were really the important person he feels he is . He wants to be the center of attention and fears appearing at a disadvantage . That is why Mr. S. has been chairman of many committees , president of many organizations . That is why , without realizing his unconscious motive , he opposed the Scout project . He had been left out ; no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the spotlight . Mrs. Nero and Mr. Star may seem to have the same thirst for power . But she seeks power for the joy of using it ; he seeks a position of power for its glory ? he is entirely willing to let someone else exercise the power . %4ISS GABY , the fourth example , is 11 in her thirties , employed in the filing room of a large firm . She does her work methodically and well ; but it is a simple routine , and any change upsets her , for she fears she can not handle it . She seems to have no interests ? goes to movies rarely , pays no attention to men , dresses plainly , never gossips with her fellow workers . They ca n't understand her , but are sorry for her because she is so timid . Miss G. sometimes wishes she were like them . Her childhood was unhappy . She was the youngest child ? nearly ten years younger than the next oldest ? and her parents had n't wanted her . Her brothers and sisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt herself , she was scolded instead of being cared for or comforted . When company arrived , she was sent upstairs . If children came to play , she was frightened and ran away . Although her basic feeling was like Mrs. Nero 's " others are against me , " she did not learn how to get her own way . So she felt : " Others are against me , and I am so helpless I ca n't do anything about it . " This is the basic factor in the Gaby pattern of Ego . Miss Gaby has done the only thing a helpless person can do in an unfriendly world ? renounced everything she can . Clothes , men , appearance mean nothing to her . She tries not to attract attention ; she is afraid of disturbing others ; she wants to be left alone . She has little confidence and is frightened by change . Fortunately , few persons conform so much to this Ego pattern . The feeling of helplessness is more often confined to a few things or relationships . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a small boy , and feels a Gabylike helplessness about water . Helen , a Gaby at horseback riding , once was i kicked by a horse . The fact is that no person conforms completely to any one Ego pattern . We all display mixtures in varying degrees of two or more of the basic types , with one pattern more or less dominant . Besides , each Ego type has its strengths . The Nero can bear hardship ( provided it is not failure ) ; is self-possessed in the 1  | presence of danger ; is aggressive ( too much so ) ; understands much about managing people . The Star has tact , politeness , graciousness , and , like the Nero , is often highly energetic and efficient . The Clinging Vine has much sound sympathy , tenderness , consideration for others , and is not quick to jump to conclusions . The Gaby is patient and capable of enduring failure . But none of us , whatever our mixture , has developed the strength of the other types . And we all have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to achieving the goals of our Ego . Pursuing such goals causes everyone , sooner or later , discomfort , because the goals are false . Our aim should be objective living , with genuine concern for the well-being of our fellowmen . Mrs. Nero , for example , seeks ? as no one should ? mastery of others . Failure causes her unnecessary distress : anxiety , fear , discouragement , bitterness , resentment , which she suffers because of her false expectations of life . So she feels under great pressure ; life appears to bear down upon her . This is the inevitable experience of all types or mixtures of types of egocentric living . The Nero usually regards this pressure as a wrong inflicted by an unkind world or an unjust God . He feels sorry for himself , rebellious against God and man . He is wrong . For pressure growing out of false demands upon life should be welcomed ; it may be a great boon . It is life 's way of telling us something is wrong within us and of giving us a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest opportunities for self-improvement come when life brings enough pressure to make us wish to escape it by finding and rectifying our errors . PRESSURE may be a minor discontent , which prompts us to make some small improvement , or tragic suffering , which forces us to realize that our whole way of life must be changed . In either case , there are general principles to follow . Although these principles may seem to be mere common sense , actually they are the best applied psychology . Self-improvement can not be achieved overnight or without hard work . The application of these principles ? especially the first ? is bound to be difficult and sometimes discouraging . These are the major prin-ciples : I. Learn how to face criticism . The more criticism hurts you ? the more it makes you want to strike back in defense ? the greater is the probability that it contains some truth . When a criticism attacks a mistake that is a vital part of your Ego ( which you unconsciously believe to be your real self ) , you rush to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticism should be coolly examined and tested for its true value . It should never be rejected ? especially if , after its first normal sting , it causes resentment , anger , or discouragement . Nor should it be accepted at once . II . Always be on the lookout for sound advice . Do not delude yourself into believing you are wise or strong enough to work out all your problems by yourself . Take criticisms or other disturbing or perplexing matters to someone who can help you see things impersonally ? a trusted friend , your pastor , a psychologist , family friend , or someone else with common sense and a sound philosophy of life . But do not expect the helper to make your decisions . Do not let him . Do not accept his opinion too readily . It , too , must be tested by your best thinking and , perhaps , by the opinion of someone else . III . Lose yourself objectively in a good cause . As far as you can , replace the conscious and unconscious efforts to serve your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration for your family , more active effort in behalf of your fellow members in a church , club , union , or other group . Be sure that you are " not merely seeking to advance indirectly the interests of your Ego . ( Mr. Star , remember , does many things for good causes ; but he does them because they bring him praise or recognition . ) IV . Seek new experiences in fields in which you are most underdeveloped . Be content to make small gains before you try for larger and larger ones . Everyone should seek to enlarge his experience by doing the things that are most difficult for him . J'ERE are a few practical suggestions HERE illustrate the application of this principle for the four Ego types . For the Nero type : 1 . Learn to refrain from putting to death , figuratively speaking , little things that do not work to your satisfaction . Do n't fling the leaky fountain pen into a corner , for instance . Instead , think carefully about what caused the difficulty . 2 . Refuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to postpone the picnic because of a shower . Readjust your plans instead of raging over your frustration . 3 . Cultivate flowers or raise animals . This will compel you to respect the law and nature of other beings , and you may learn patience and lose some of your imperiousness. 4 . Force yourself to accept the will of the majority when outvoted in your organization , thus learning that you need not be the deciding power . For the Star type : 1 . Mingle with others at a reception or elsewhere without dressing conspicuously or otherwise trying to attract attention . 2 . See people when you do not appear to the best advantage ? for example , when your hair is in curlers . 3 . Listen to a discussion without saying anything , even if you think you know the answer to the problem being discussed . 4 . Imagine that someone has been given credit for a splendid idea of yours , without resenting the injustice but being glad the idea will be carried out for the benefit of a group . Live this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , live it in reality . 5 . Learn to play a game , even if you do n't do it well enough to win often . For the Clinging Vine type : 1 . Every day make even trifling decisions by yourself , not according to public opinion , custom , or what someone advises . 2 . Learn to tell disagreeable truths . Do it kindly and carefully , but do it . Criticize your protector , superior , or employer ? calmly and modestly , but tell him the truth as you see it or why you disagree with his plans or ideas . 3 . Examine many things in a store ; but do not be talked into buying something you do n't want . Take back what you bought yesterday and exchange it ? three times , if really necessary . 4 . Try to help yourself . Make up your mind to face disagreeable situations and do so alone ? for example , asking a sullen landlord to repaper the house . 5 . Take responsibility not only for yourself but for others , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book . Do not accept the blame if others act on your advice and are not satisfied . Be prepared to argue that it may be their fault . Gaby individuals find it especially difficult to seek new experiences . But progress will come if they follow these sug-gestions : 1 . Overcome your laziness . Get up early , even if you do n't have to . 2 . Go to see someone , even if you do n't like him , and try to be pleasant and entertaining . 3 . Do things you do n't want to do , especially for others . 4 . Take responsibility ; start a task , a job . a plan , and see it through , even if unforeseen difficulties arise . By such means , difficult and slow though they may be , you can correct the mistakes you have unconsciously built into your Ego pattern . Then you will achieve a more abundant , more satisfying life than you have ever imagined . So study yourself ; make a courageous Ego analysis . After pain and hardship and triumph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strengths . Not only do I more clearly see my weaknesses . but I know how to master them . And I will : "
