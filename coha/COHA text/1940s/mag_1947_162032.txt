Nowhere in the world were there meatier , tastier ducks than those which the Emperor Tung Chi raised in the Imperial aviaries at Peking , China . In 1873 a Connecticut Yankee named James E. Palmer contrived to bring three of the Emperor 's ducks and one indispensable drake to the U.S. This quacking quartet hatched an industry . <P> On Long Island , which now raises five to six million Pekin ducks a year-about half the total U.S. supply-duck farmers last week were half-wishing the Emperor had kept his ducks . Their feed costs were the highest ever , but the price of ducks had dropped 13% in a month . Now , at the peak of their season , Long Islanders are shipping some 200,000 ducks a week to market . But wholesale prices have fallen to 26 a pound , 2 below the old OPA ceiling . <P> Long Island 's production comes from about 76 farms . In one half-mile stretch on Big Seatuck Creek alone , nearly 1,000,000 ducks are being raised this year . It all started when Farmer W. W. Hallock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pekin " ducks . The ducks thrived on the sandy soil and the tidal streams . Quack Farmer Hallock soon had plenty of rivals . <P> Russell Hallock , his grandson , now runs the Farmers ' Commission House Inc. in Manhattan , which buys 60% of all Long Island ducks , processes and freezes them to sell to the big packers . <P> As ducks do not have much sense , a dog 's bark or a floating feather may scare them into piling up in great heaps in which the bottom ducks smother . Sometimes dive-bombing seagulls frighten them into drowning . Diseases may wipe out whole hatches . Yet when the Long Island Duck Farmers ' Association recently hired a retired physician to conduct research into cures , he had difficulty getting information from tight-lipped quack farmers . During the prosperous war years , duck farmers netted anywhere from $7,000 to $50,000 a year-thanks partially to the 90 a pound they got for duck feathers for airmen 's vests . <P> The farmers simply measure their profits by money in the bank ( or sock ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them borrow at the start of the season ) . Last week , most of them thought they were losing money , but none knew for sure . This much they did know : a duck eats 25 pounds of feed in the nine weeks it takes to reach the five-pound-plus marketing size . At $100 a ton for feed , that is $1.25 for a duck which now brings around $1.22 at the commission house .
