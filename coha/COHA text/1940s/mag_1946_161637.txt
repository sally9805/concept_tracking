Into Jefferson City , Mo . last week surged a motorcade of 350 Missouri veterans demanding a special session of the legislature to vote them a $400 cash bonus . When they reached the ornate capitol , square-chinned Governor Phil M. Donnelly invited them inside , sat them down on the hard marble floor . Then he gave them a piece of his mind : <P> " You come down here by number and by force , if you please , and expect me to decide a debatable question . . . . We do n't have a government of threats or intimidation or of trying to stampede the governor into some proposition your own organizations are n't agreed upon . . . . There is no occasion to call a special session of the legislature and I do not intend to do so . " <P> The abashed bonus seekers packed up their pup tents and silently stole away .
