" If Mr. Roemer has read history at all he should know that there has been a temperance movement of one form or other in this country since the days of the ' Protestant Thomas Hooker , and there probably will be one " until the roll is called up yonder . " If Mr. Roemer thinks he can " put an end to it , " he is doing a disservice to the wets and , moreover , is showing a lack of understanding of his country , PETER DECKER , New York , March 30 , 1943.
