Last week the President took a long step toward economic warfare . When he froze the U.S. assets ( and future financial transactions ) of the 16 remaining unfrozen European countries ( see p. 13 ) , he did not merely lock the stable door too late . Though the big horse was gone , several ponies still fed in the U.S. stall . Dividends and patent royalties due Germans have been piling up in the U.S. , providing dollars that could easily be used to finance the Gestapo in this Hemisphere as well as at home . Some of the newly frozen neutrals , notably Switzerland , have been financial servants of the Axis . The President 's order locked these ponies in for good . <P> By including neutral nations in his order , the President finessed the problem that most worried the State Department-slapping the Axis alone . But in an accompanying statement , he showed an inclination to be more lenient with the Governments ( and citizens ) of Finland , Portugal , Spain , Sweden , Switzerland and the U.S.S.R. than with Italy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations , he indicated , might avoid freezing control through general licenses permitting financial transactions " upon the receipt of adequate assurances . . . that the general licenses will not be employed ... to evade the ( anti-Axis ) purposes of this order . " <P> But there were more cogent reasons than pure diplomacy for including neutral nations in the order . This was clear from an SEC report to Congress earlier last week . After four years of study , SEC admitted it could not discover who controlled the American I. G. Chemical Corp . originally sponsored by I. G. Farbenindustrie , but since 1939 called General Aniline &; Film ( textiles , dyes , Agfa Ansco camera equipment ) . SEC revealed that the original U.S. directors of the firm , including Standard Oil of New Jersey 's Walter Teagle , had no idea who controlled it either . The trail ended in Switzerland , where a number of long-named banking firms were holders " of record , " but not " beneficially , " of over 75% of the company 's voting stock , for principals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well have been due to the ancient banking principle ( nowhere more grimly adhered to than in Switzerland ) that bankers do n't tell on their clients . The fact remains that many business transactions that look Nazi from the U.S. side , wind up in a dead end somewhere in Switzerland . It is a safe bet that Switzerland , willingly or not , has been acting as Germany 's banker since the war began , as she did before the war . <P> The other chief U.S. source of German income is patents . Royalties due to German firms for patents licensed to U.S. companies ( including Standard Oil 's right to produce synthetic rubber by the buna process ) have not all been sent out of the U.S. , but they were a prime source of capital for Nazi propaganda and espionage here . Now , the best that is likely to happen to their legal claimants is that their royalties will be held for them until the war is over . <P> Another hole the order can plug : Nazi purchases of U.S.-held German securities , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already have run into millions . Besides saving a lot of money for Germany , this repatriation had propagandized Germany as an honest nation , eager to pay its debts .
