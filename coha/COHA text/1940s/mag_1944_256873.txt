With robomb speed the news swept feminine Britain-hips will henceforth be streamlined , busts will again be budgetable . By edict of the nine middle-aged men who sit on the Corset Advisory Board , Britain 's " austerity " corset ( TIME , Aug. 7 ) has gone the way of the bustle and the hoopskirt . No more will the cotton-and-cardboard stays bulge in the wrong places , snag up in coils where curves should be . There will now be unlimited steel for buckles , hooks , , studs ; rubber for suspenders ( garters ) ; bone for busks ( rigid frontal supports ) . For foundation and trimmings , there will be lace , plush , velvet . Britain 's long-suffering women , plump from their starchy wartime diet , hailed the new order in corsets : it would uplift both midriff and morale. * <P> * For other news of uplifted midriffs , etc. , see ART .
