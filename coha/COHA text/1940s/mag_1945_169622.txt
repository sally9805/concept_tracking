At the end of last week the President looked tired . He looked forward to getting out of Washington and out among the people . <P> First he had a promise to keep to an old Missouri friend , portly , bald Bennett Champ Clark , his appointee to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals and a former Senate colleague . In a century-old Episcopal church at Berryville , Va. , the President stood as best man as Widower Clark and British-born Actress Violet Heming were married . Best Man Truman , the only participant not in formal rig , seemed to be the calmest person in the church . He delivered the ring at the right moment , stood through the ceremony , then stepped back into a pew with Mrs. Truman and daughter Mary Margaret , both in street dress . The President did not kiss the 50-year-old , misty-eyed bride . <P> After a reception and a 90-minute drive back to Washington , the President was off on a five-day holiday . It looked for a time as if rainy , foggy weather would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sacred Cow " transport plane put him down 795 miles away , in front of a cheering crowd at Blytheville , Ark. ( pop . 10,652 ) . <P> There the President made a tour of the town , dropped in to visit relatives of Reconversion Boss John W. Snyder , who was with him . Then there was a 25-mile drive through the swampy cotton lands to Caruthersville ( pop . 6,612 ) , in the southeast " boot " of Missouri . When the President arrived at the Majestic Hotel 's packed lobby , his face showed deep lines of weariness . <P> And Pie la Mode . The ladies of the Methodist Church had cooked up a typical country dinner-baked chicken and dressing , candied sweet potatoes , cranberry jelly , salad , apple pie and ice cream . The 42-room hotel 's " banquet room " was hung with pennants . Against the printed wallpaper were a Kiwanis Club shield , a Junior Chamber of Commerce emblem , a War Bond campaign thermometer . <P> Harry Truman began to have fun . He yelled gibes at newsmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neal Helm , an old Caruthersville friend who sat to his right . He was completely at home , and everybody in the room was at home with the President . Just before the pie la mode , a grey-haired woman announced that the President " has consented to play Paderewski 's Minuet . " <P> Harry Truman arose , motioned to the others to keep their seats . At the piano he turned to remark : " When Stalin heard me play this he signed the protocol at Potsdam . " The piano was not in good tune and Harry Truman was not in his best musical form . He confessed that he had finished the Minuet with a few bars of a Mozart sonata . Then there were autographs to sign-from a toy bear to a WAVE 's leave papers . <P> <P> Early to Rise . At 7:15 next morning-45 minutes before breakfast-the President strolled out of the hotel . The lines of fatigue had vanished from his face . He was chewing gum . He did what most visitors to a small town do when there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad station . Then he went on down to the Mississippi River bank and performed the local rite of spitting in it . He dropped in at the telegraph office . He met a friend , the postmaster , and talked crops and swapped gossip with him .
