Man of the Year <P> Sir : <P> Time and TIME will both prove in the near future that the Man of the Year is and should be Dwight Eisenhower . <P> EARLE GRUESKIN Evanston , Ill . <P> <P> Sir : <P> We of the Broadmoor Businessmen 's Association have nominated Mayor deLesseps S. Morrison our " Man of the Year . " <P> <P> LEWIS A. ROSSI <P> New Orleans <P> Sir : <P> ... I think the cover of TIME should be left blank , for two reasons : <P> In the first place , it is representative of what the mind of man has accomplished this past year . <P> Secondly , it is also representative of the tremendous vastness of the universe , and how little a part man has played in the scheme of things . <P> CHARLES PORTER HOCHSTADTER Cincinnati <P> Sir : <P> May I nominate a fearless fighter in a blundering world . . . Columnist and Newspaperman Drew Pearson . <P> <P> ( MRS . ) W. H. MORRIS <P> Akron <P> Coincidence <P> Sir : <P> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's providential . <P> I refer , of course , to the make-up of your Nov. 17 issue , pages 34-35 , wherein the Goodyear ad picturing Macy 's Thanksgiving Day Parade is in apposition to the photo of the Bolshevik 30th Anniversary Parade in Moscow . <P> If one picture is worth a thousand words , two such contrasting ones are worth a million in showing the gap between totalitarianism and democracy . <P> <P> WALTER D.

For the sake of my peace of mind and the self-assurance and relief of hundreds of diabetics , please note that : <P> 1 ) The miracle of insulin by Nobelist Banting and his colleague Best is still the greatest single contribution to stretching the diabetic 's life as long as the non-diabetic 's . <P> 2 ) ! did not intend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of insulin or diabetic therapy . <P> 3 ) The magnificent discoverers of insulin have actually so lengthened the diabetic 's life that he is now eligible ( in a well-regulated case ) for life insurance . <P> 4 ) A complication of diabetes such as arteriosclerosis is no different from the nondiabetic except it appears somewhat sooner . <P> 5 ) Solving the problem for the diabetic may therefore help the far greater number of nondiabetics from the complications of arteriosclerosis . <P> 6 ) I personally do not fear gangrene because I feel that the progress of medical researchers will finally conquer this heretofore neglected disease ( arteriosclerosis ) . <P> 7 ) And , finally , as a diabetic , I feel proud for the fun of working and living-the privilege of all diabetics since Banting and Best . <P> ROBERT A.
