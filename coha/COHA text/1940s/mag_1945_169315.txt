Harry Truman showed that he knew how to step up and take on a fight . Over the wrathful objections of Senate President Kenneth McKellar , he nominated David E. Lilienthal for another nine-year term as chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority . <P> The President coolly announced the appointment only 24 hours after beet-nosed Mr. McKellar and his Tennessee colleague , Senator Tom Stewart , had called at the White House to try to head it off . Said McKellar : " We protested with all the vigor and zeal we have . " <P> Loud-mouthed Kenneth McKellar had been roaring against businesslike , liberal-minded TVAman Lilienthal for several years , had carried on a patronage feud with him with all the passion of a home-state mountaineer . But last week McKellar discovered that , despite his new power in the Senate , he had been boxed in . Good friend Truman had already enhanced the McKellar prestige by inviting him to attend Cabinet meetings ; the Senator from Tennessee could ill afford a last-ditch patronage row at the very start of the Truman Administration . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress , but it looked as though McKellar would have to be content . Politician McKellar was in the hands of a man who knew the business too . <P> The Payoff . If Harry Truman could act with political acumen and courage , he could also act like an old-line party man . Day after he nominated Lilienthal , he just as coolly paid off a political debt to the late ex-Convict Tom Pendergast , who had sent him to the U.S. Senate . <P> The President sacked the man who had sent Boss Pendergast to the penitentiary : Maurice M. Milligan , U.S. Attorney for western Missouri . For this post . Truman nominated Sam M. Wear , Springfield attorney and Democratic State chairman of Missouri . <P> Once , on the Senate floor , Truman had brought blushes to the faces of other Senators by a violent attack on Milligan . Only a few weeks before Franklin Roosevelt 's death he had tried to block Milligan 's reappointment . Senator Harry Truman had never forsworn his allegiance to his old and disreputable boss , nor his grudge against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
