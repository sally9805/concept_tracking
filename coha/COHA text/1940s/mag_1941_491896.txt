U SING an Orson Welles technique , the Department of the Interior loosed by radio in 1939 a frightening picture of an America without oil . Four days after the last broadcast , a bill written and sponsored by the department and calling for Federal control of the $14,000,000,000 oil industry was introduced by Rep. William P. Cole , of Maryland . Led by Secretary Ickes , who had been oil czar in NRA days , the Administration forces made two additional broadcasts in October and December , 1939 . In the H. G. Wells style of fearful things to come , the programs dramatized an alarming prophecy of the consequences of oil waste . They portrayed a doctor unable to reach a dying woman because filling stations bad no gasoline ; a burning schoolhouse , and fire engines unable to move ; trains unable to leave stations ; airplanes grounded ; steamers stopped in midocean ; our Navy and guns useless for defense ; factories shut down ; people without light and cooked food . The " seeds for such a calamity already have been sown and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partment of the Interior spokesman declared . Oil men were portrayed as laughingly enjoying the burning of gasoline while housewives , railroad engineers , bootblacks , filling-station attendants and politicians were angrily protesting oil-industry practices . Listeners were urged to insist to their congressmen that the Department of the Interior be given power " to fight the waste of oil for us . " Such unprecedented use of radio by a Government department to influence legislation resulted in strong language in Congress when the Interior Department appropriation bill came up in March , 1940 . An amendment was adopted providing that no portion of the appropriation " shall be used for radio programs designed for or calculated to influence the ! J , ssage or defeat of any legislation pending before Congress . " The broadcasts ' effectiveness can not be measured , but proof that they at least had the appeal of a Lone Ranger program was given by Secretary Ickes in an address to George Washington University alumni , when he read as a typical letter received in his office , " Dear Uncle Sam : I am only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil that is going on is terrific . And I depend upon you to help us citizens to stop it . " Oil men suggested Ickes could further marshal young America to his aid by promising to send handsome " Junior Conservation Officer " badges in return for any letter condemning the industry . They expressed their opinion of Ickes in language no less vituperative than his own in regard to them . Most recurrent of their charges is that /ekes ' desire is to be " oil dictator . " The Secretary publicly denied such charges in March in an address before the Kilgore , Texas , chamber of commerce ; the occasion being the tenth anniversary of discovery of the East Texas oil field , largest in the world . In attacking Cole Bill opponents , he said , " To fight this ewntially patriotic bill  --  yes , I consider it patriotic to defend the resources of our country  --  its opponents have dragged out an old and smelly red herring . The governor of Oklahoma , for instance , told the American Petroleum Institute that the Cole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and that ' collectiviam ' is ' the bone and sinew of vommunism ' ! I hope that the learned governor held his nose while flailing oily collectivism with his putrid red herring . " Both Administration and oil-industry forces have indulged in nose holding , and many " red herrings " have been dragged under the public 's nose . On one side , the New Deal passionately appeals to the citizens ' patriotism . America 's oil must be conserved for national defense by Government control . On the other side , the oil industry cries warningly of destruction of states ' rights and the establishment of Government dictatorship of all industry if Federal oil control is permitted . The Petroleum Picture H OWEVER , behind the sound and fury is a significant story . The European war has made Americans more conscious than ever of the importance of oil in the world picture . Next to munitions , oil is the most vital war necessity . Once a country 's oil line is broken , the end is not far . But daily headlines of oil 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world 's proved oil reserves lie within our borders and our wells produce 60 per cent of the world 's oil . In war , European belligerents ' greatest problem would never be America 's . Of equal importance is the fact that oil is America 's second largest peacetime industry . Control of this industry is seat- ? tered among thousands of producing , refining and marketing companies , large and small , who submit only to the authority of such rules and regulations as the twenty-three oil-producing states see fit to prescribe . For the past seven years the Administration has been conducting an antagonistic series of investigations into In unrestricted If linois wells are drilled so close together that one may step from one rig floor to another . the industry . Oil men accused the Government of seeking an entering wedge for Federal control . Then , during the summer of 1939 , two related things happened  --  European developments seriously portended war and the Cole Bill was introduced . The Government had found its excuse to urge control openly . The Cole Bill accuses the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to endanger petroleum reserves for military and civil needs in national defense . It provides for establishment of a Department of the Interior petroleum-conservation office , giving its commissioner power to determine what is and is not oil waste and to remedy the situation by such rules and regulations as he wishes . No appeal from his decisions is provided . America 's oil war was on . Immediately upon outbreak of war in Europe , Secretary Ickes spoke to the nation . " Almost as much dentrue , tion could be brought to our national resources through internal exploitation as if we were invaded by a foreign nation , " he said . " I am apprehensive that there will be the usual effort made by petroleum interests to rape our natural resources for the sake of war profits . " Government trust buster Thurman W. Arnold followed with a warning to oil men that his office would make generous use of the criminal indictment to break up wartime " profiteering . " In November , 1939 , the Cole committee opened hearings in Washington which were to last through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became apparent that in its haste to tie control in with the war , the Department of the Interior had not carefully prepared its case . Instead of presenting proof of waste , Government technical men praised the industry for the methods it has developed . Secretary Ickes hurriedly announced that he had asked directors of the Geological Survey and the Bureau of Mines to make " full reports " on present and recent avoidable waste instances . He then sent employees of these two units around the country with orders to " find waste . " Three months later he submitted results . Typical example was the report on the Oklahoma Bird Creek field , developed thirty-four years ago . Five wells now produce eleven barrels of oil a day , and investigators said tanks in which oil is stored are in poor condition , permitting oil to soak into 200 feet of surrounding ground to a depth of five inches . Then John W. Finch , director of the U. S. Bureau of Mines , refused actively-to support the bill and was abruptly fired from his job . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . H. A. Stuart , naval petroleum-reserves director , and Col. Harry K. Rutherford , planning-branch director of the War Departmeat . Admiral Stuart said present naval reserves are " far from sufficient " for future needs , and expressed grave fears of our oil future if present oil production rates continue . Both said our wartime consumption would be approximately 15 per cent , above normal . Our annual consumption being 1,000 , - 000,000 barrels , consumption would increase by 150,000,000 barrels in war . Neither pointed out that current production is curtailed by the states to around 3,500,000 barrels per day . Maximum war needs would not amount to more than six weeks ' curtailed production and it would simply be a question of opening up valves for the states to raise the allowable production to compensate for the war demand . Mr. Ickes created a highly controversial issue by stating , " I do not think there ought to be any powers to fix prices under this bill or do anything that would have that effect .. To do so would discredit the whole conservation theory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still carry front the famous 1937-3S Madison , Wisconsin , trial , where a farmer jury convicted thirty executives and sixteen major companies on charges of antitrust violation brought by the Department of Justice . This trial , held hundreds of miles from oil territory , was based on charges that oil men and companies conspired to fix gasoline prices . The defendants maintained that their actions had been encouraged by the Government and specifically by Ickes during NRA days , in order to stabilize the market by removing " a competitive evil  --  distress gasoline . " Judge Patrick Stone dismissed indictments against ten individuals and one company , granted new trials to fif teen individuals and three companies , and fined twelve companies and five individuals an aggregate of 565.000 . The Department of Justice filed an appeal against the dismissals in the U. S. Circuit Court at Chicago , which upheld Judge Stone . The Department of Justice then appealed to the U. S. Supreme Court , which in November , 1939 , decided the case against the Government . In the meantime , the U. S. Circuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies and five individuals and granted them new trials . The Justice Department appealed this reversal to the U. S. Supreme Court. , which in May , 1940 , handed down by a five-to-two vote a far-reaching decision sustaining the conviction of the twelve companies and five individuals . The ruling makes price-fixing agreements illegal , no matter whether they eliminate competitive abuses or evils or reasonable prices result . This decision tuts given all industry concern , as price-fixing agreements resulting in reasonable prices are in practice in many fields . Oil men pointed out , and were upheld by Alfred G. White , chief economist of the Petroleum Economics Division of the Bureau of Mines , that it is impossible to regulate production without fixing prices . The economics of this is simple . if oil is produced in excess of current demand , prices go down , If less oil is produced than there is demand for , prices go up . If production and demand approximately balance , prices remain stable . If the Government should regulate production , it , would automatically enter into price-fixing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than resulting from natural relationship of demand to supply , a delicate situation may ensue . Producers want higher prices ; consumers want lower prices ; labor wants higher wages : stockholders want bigger dividends ; oil companies want more profits . With all interested parties bringing political pressure on a Government department , regulation of oil production would become a political as well as a conserve-I ion problem . The Conservation Question Mr. Ickes calls overproduction waste . Yet ho condemned as price-fixing the measure used by six states , producing three fourths of the country 's oil , to solve an overproduction problem tlu'eatening to demoralize the industry in August , 1939 . Six states shut down all oil production for two weeks when crude-oil prices were cut twenty cents a barrel by Sinclair interests , and other major companies followed . Oil stocks were depleted by 30,000,000 barrels in two weeks . When normal production resumed , former prices were restored . The states contended that the shutdown was conservution , as it protected stripper wells , which comprise three fourths of the country 's oil wells and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A stripper well averages only a few barrels a day  --  sometimes only one barrel . It is the fag end of a once flush oil well . Operating costs are so high that the margin of profit is slender . A cut in crude prices forces the operator to abandon the well . Once these wells are abandoned , water creeps in , flooding the oil sand , and the remaining oil is irrecoverable . If 18 per cent of the nation 's reserve should be lost in this way , it could well be called waste . The two weeks ' shutdown saved stripper wells , since prices were restored and they were able to continue to operate . But Mr. Ickes saw no " conservation " in the measure . Congressman Cole seriously objected to the states ' action . The six states produce three fourths of the nation 's oil , but the remaining forty-two states , which had no voice in the mutter , consume three fourths of the nation 's gasoline . He called this a matter of " real concern . " ? Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or proposed to handle conservation by methods other than those already developed and used by the majority of the industry , they rightfully made great capital of two glaring examples of the need for regulation  --  Illinois and California . Oil men can only hang their heads when these two states are mentioned . Neither has laws regulating production , and all efforts toward conservation have been repeatedly defeated . With California the seeand largest oil-producing state and Illinois third , both combined producing 27 per cent of the nation 's oil , the industry 's argument that the oil states properly can deal with conservation is weakened . These two states indulge in the industry 's disreputable early-day practices . Illinois is the worst offender , as there has been a voluntary agreement among most California producers . Illinois wells are allowed to run wide open , quickly exhausting gas pressure , so that . quantities of oil can never be recovered . Wells are drilled as closely together as pins on a completely filled pincushion , thereby draining an oil pool too quickly and ultimately losing oil that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which practice and support conservation in other states hypocritically produce to the utmost in Illinois and California . The private citizen has been playing the same game in Illinois . Small tracts  --  sometimes only an acre  --  set aside for school lands , but never used , are leased . The lessee goes to the oil company operating surrounding properties and announces he intends to drill several wells on his acre . This would necessitate operators of surrounding properties drilling five to seven unnecessary wells . To avoid such expense , the operators buy the lease at the lessee 's price . One company paid $50,000 for such a one-acre lease . Roadways marked on old plats , but never laid out , are similarly used . One company paid $450,000 for a lease on a tract of land seven feet wide at one end , twenty-three feet wide at the other , and only half a mile long . Church lands , railroad rights of way , county and state drainage ditches are all used for the same pay-off game . Sometimes they are actually drilled , which results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other fellow from getting all the oil . Most of the other oil states practice conservation in some form or other . and , on the whole , produce oil in orderly and scientific fashion . They suffer from the Illinois-California situation , as oil men and companies naturally go where the quickest profit is to be made , neglecting drilling in other states and buying Illinois and California oil , which sells under market prices . Illinois ' unrestricted and increased production , combined with the sharp decline in European exports since the war , is responsible for the industry again facing a serious overproduction problem with a resultant price-cut threat . As usual , the other oil states are the ones that not only are suffering the consequences of Illinois ' greed but that must find some way to cope with the problem without Illinois ' co-operation . These states have made drastic cuts in monthly production and are discussing shutting down all oil production for a short time , just as six states met a similar crisis in August , 1939 . While these states are holding meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign to increase production . Although Illinois in spectacular fashion jumped from 12,000 barrels daily production at the end of 1936 to a peak of 550,000 barrels daily in 1940 , its production is now declining , because of the noneonserving method by which oil has been produced , and the flashy type of production discovered . The flurry of new drilling is duo to the state 's greedy determination to keep the 550,000-barrel-daily market it has built up at the expense of other states . Midnight Oil in . The Cole committee made field trips only to Illinois , California and LouisiaMthough Louisiana , fifth largest oil-producing state , has conservation regulations , among its other scandals is flagrant violation of the Connally Hot-Oil Act , which made the shipment in interstate commerce of oil produced in excess of state regulations a Federal offense . The commission made no studies in states or areas where conservation is honored and scientifically practiced . The Government has capitalized on other weaknesses in the industry . Texas , producing two fifths of U. S. oil , has a far from clean conservation record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run . A typical example of hot-oil operations is given by an Oklahoma oil man . Driving through the famous East Texas field during the summer , his radiator boiled over . In search of water , ho climbed over a lease fence posted with KEEP OUT , ABSOLUTELY No TRESPASSERS signs . A pumper ran out , ordering him off the lease . The oil man explained ho needed water , but that made no difference to the enraged pumper . As the oil man retreated , the pumper called , " Hey , wait a minute ! Are n't you Mr. ? ? " Upon admitting he was , the pumper , suddenly all smiles , reminded him that he had formerly worked for him in Oklahoma . The pumper produced water and conversation . Finally he told the oil man that the reason he had ordered him off the lease so discourteously was that they were running hot oil . " During the daytime , " he explained . " we run our allowable ( the amount of oil state regulations permit a well to produce daily ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and runs a thousand barrels of hot oil . But at two A.M. the gauger comes back alone , and he and I run a thousand barrels . But you know , the so-and-so 's who buy the oil pay the boss sixty cents a barrel for his , but they 'll only pay the gauger and me forty cents a barrel for ours ! " Another industry weakness is the perpetual fight between independent operators and major companies . Although the two groups are unanimous in opposing Federal control , independents presented much testimony before the Cole committee accusing major companies of monopoly practices prejudicial to small operators . Major companies set industry policies , and little fellows are forced to follow . Lacking big capital and unable to absorb losses through varied activities , the small operator has a tough time . Yet the independent plays a vital role , as it is he who discovers 86 per cent of new oil pools . Independents go prospecting into new areas in the best traditions of romance , gambling with Mother Nature . If they get a dry hole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Out of 1939 's 287 new oil pools discovered in thirteen states , 224 were found by independent producers ' and wildcatters . The wildcatter goes where everyone else says there is no oil , uses all science available , manages by a thousand different ways to finance a well , and finds oil . Due to the independent wildcatter , reserves continually increase . One of Secretary Ickes ' arguments for Federal control is that we are exhausting oil reserves so fast that an oil " scarcity " is imminent . Oil men argue that Federal control would put the wildcatters out of business and consequently so reduce oil discoveries that there then would be true cause for worry . Strict Federal regulations and red tape would increase the independents ' financing problems and destroy the incentive of quick profits on discovery by selling holdings to major companies for reserves . At present , discoveries far exceed demand . In 1939 new proved crude-oil reserves totaled twice the amount of oil produced , raising total reserves to a record high of 18,483,012,000 barrels . Scientists agree that an oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ' hearing , the oil industry presented vast amounts of technical testimony , showing methods by which oil conservation is practiced in various areas . This testimony was overwhelming in quantity and tediousness . The industry then attacked the constitutionality of the Cole Bill . But its case was argued most effectively by the oil states themselves . As it takes fire to fight fire , it takes politicians to fight politicians . All the oil states went on record as unalterably opposed to any form of Federal control . Nine belligerent , governors descended upon Washington in a body to express their views to the President , Secretary Ickes and the Cole committee . Led by fiery , red-headed Gov . Loon C. Phillips , of Oklahoma , chairman of the Interstate Oil Compact Commission , the governors of Oklahoma , Kansas , Montana , New Mexico , Arkansas , Wyoming , West Virginia , Georgia and Pennsylvania raised the most vociferous protest of encroachment on state rights that has been heard since the South seceded . Governor Phillips asked the embarrassing question , " Can we expect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bettor than its agricultural efforts have been in Oklahoma ? In our state , the small farmer has been driven from the land to WPA rolls . Can we point with pride to Government regulation of railroads ? Shall we shut our eyes to the fact that they are now almost wholly dependent upon advances by the Government ? Do the results of governmental regulation of the coal industry tempt us to favor Government control of oil ? " King of the Golden River All the governors bitterly opposed establishment of the bill 's " dictator " commissioner . When Mr. Ickes was " oil czar " during NRA , he appointed as oil-administration-hoard chairman , Nathan R. Margold , present Interior Department solicitor . Everything relating to oil had to be taken up with Margold , whose sole oil experience consisted of being an attorney from New York . Three oil executives claim that Margold showed them a work sheet for oil-industry control with himself as head of a bureau with an annual pay roll of approximately 83,000,000 . Appointment of the Cole Bill oil . commissioner again rests with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industry finished testifying , they had presented so strong a case that the chances of the bill 's enactment seemed alight . An informal poll of the Senate and House membership did not disclose a member , even Congressman Cole , who would declare himself flatly in favor of the bill . The latter had conducted a fair hearing . lie was well grounded , having been chairman of the original Cole committee which investigated the oil business in 1934 . At the bearing 's conclusion in late March , oil men were confident they had won their fight and that the legislation would be killed in committee , They underestimated the determination of Government forces . On April first , Mr. Cole made public correspondence between President Roosevelt and himself concerning the bill . In a letter dated March fourth , Mr. Roosevelt reminded the representative that he had asked him to introduce the bill and that ho " endorsed fully " its objectives . Mr. Roosevelt added that , as the committee had virtually completed hearings , he was " hopeful " that suitable legislation would be framed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will give due recognition to the views expressed at your hearings by the officials of the oil-producing states and representatives of the oil industry . " Cole quickly replied that the committee wondered whether Mr. ROCISDvalt 's request to give " due recognition " to such attitudes suggested any approach to the problem different from the Cole Bill . Mr. Roosevelt answered that he would n't suggest any different approach from a legislative viewpoint , but only from the viewpoint of " modification of enforcement procedures . " He suggested that standards of production should be set up by the Federal Government , but that they should be enforced only when states failed to pass laws to enforce them or failed to enforce state laws . This letter was hailed in news stories as a " compromise " indicating that the Cole Bill would be revised to take care of only those states which had no conservation  --  Illinois and California . This Rooseveltian strategy was to quiet opposition from other oil-producing states and possibly enlist the support of producers now losing their markets to uncontrolled Illinois production . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saving our resources for national defense , and not treading upon too many toes in the process . Close examination of Mr. Roosevelt 's proposal shows it , however , to be the same boy in a different overcoat . The same sort of " Federal agency " would be established ; the Government would be the sole prescriber of standards of production ; the Government would decide whether these standards were being " properly " enforced in states with conservation regulations ; the Government would be the law enforcer ; in short , the bill would still mean Federal oil control as complete as the present Cole Bill provides . Washington 's Big Stick Further evidence of the Administration 's determination was given by introduction of a Senate resolution calling for the investigation of the sale and distribution of natural gas and oil ; announcement from Thurman Arnold that the Justice Department proposes fifteen major investigations this year relating to oil ; and the beginning of an investigation by the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee of matters affecting the transportation of oil and its products by tankers , due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of most serious import is the dilemma in which oil men have been placed by the Administration 's attitude toward the industry in the accelerated national-defense program . The industry is adequately prepared to meet all oil and fuel demands . Production can be immediately increased to meet any demand by merely opening up already producing but substantially curtailed oil wells . Refining capacity exceeds by 1,000 , - 000 barrels daily the amount of oil now being produced . The industry is fared with no problem other than the management and method of co-operation with the Government  --  which is where the rub comes . The industry is afraid that cooperation with the National Defense Advisory Commission will violate the antitrust laws and it will be penalized even more than it was in the Madison trial for co-operating with a Government agency . The grounds for this fear are given by the attitude of Attorney-General Robert H. Jackson . Some members of the National Defense Advisory Commission feel that it will be necessary to amend the antitrust laws relieving from all penalties co-operating industries that act under commission instructions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws , on the ground that he has the authority or power to grant immunity to co-operating industries . This is a complete reversal of the position he took during the Madison trial when he argued that no Cabinet officer or Government official could grant immunity from the terms of the antitrust laws and consequently oil men could not be excused from their pricefLxing activities in the recovery movemerit by their contention that they acted under the supervision and approval of Secretary Ickes . Last July , Jackson and Arnold were ready , after many months of preparation , to file an antitrust suit against the industry , which was to be one of the biggest cases in antitrust history . Twenty-two major oil companies and their several hundred subsidiaries were to be sued to " disintegrate " the companies so as to separate transportation and marketing from production . The suit also was to seek to prevent what the antitrust division claimed to be " existing abuses in the oil industry in-chiding price-fixing , discriminations and all practices which tend to restrain or prejudice the independents in the industry or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson and Arnold agreed to hold up filing the suit until the National Defense Advisory Commission could determine how far it would affect the national-defense program . After careful study of the proposed suit the Defense Commission submitted its report . It stated that the " existing organizational structure of the oil industry is well adapted to the defense program " and that " it simplifies problems of supply and reedit:stem the making of firm and long-range commitments . " If the oil companies were forced to divest themselves of their marketing and transportation facilities , loss of technical management and efficiency , complications , delays and curbs on capital expansion could be expected . Of vital importance would be the adverse effect upon Army and Navy plans and negotiations with the oil companies for national-defense purposes . Both the Army and the Navy are negotiating with the oil companies to have the companies build pipe lines from the Texas and Mid-Continent oil fields to the East Coast states to eliminate the long haul by tanker around Florida and up the Atlantic coast , which in time of emergency might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service . This would also release tankers to handle essential products such as Navy fuel oil , which can not be handled in crude oil or gasoline pipe lines . These proposed pipe lines would also afford exceptionally desirable locations for Army and Navy reserve stocks of aviation gasoline due to low-cost deliveries and immediate availability in time of emergency . The commission stated that if the suit . were filed all these plans would have to be discarded . Furthermore , it stated , disintegration of the companies might increase the diffieulty of the Army and the Navy in obtaining supplies , would lead to increase of cost to tho Government , would give refiners difficulty in meeting Government-contract commitments , and would intensify the problem of financing additional crude-oil pipe-line construction considered necessary in time of emergency . Also , if the suit were to be filed it would mean that the Maritime Commission and the Navy would have to end present negotiations with the oil companies in regard to supplying tankers to the Navy in time of emergency . This strong presentation caused Jackson to eliminate this particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was not abandoning this phase of the suit by any means and that the antitrust division simply does not seek " at this time " to compel the oil companies " to get rid of " transportation and marketing facilities . The revised suit , which the antitrust division filed on last September thirtieth , seeks to dissolve the American Petroleum Institute , the research organization of the industry ; to restrain the oil companies from various activities which the Government claims constitute price-fixing and discrimination against independents in the industry ; to prevent the oil companies from acquiring crude-oil reserves when the purpose or effect is restraint or monopoly of trade ; to prevent concerted activities of the companies which have the effect of reducing the amount of crude oil produced or the amounts of petroleum products manufactured . The oil companies contend that through this last objective the Government seeks to prevent them from practicing healthy conservation . The National Defense Commission stated in its report that " sound conservation is of the utmost importance to any adequate defense program . " The Defense Commission pointed out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities has been the organization of a newly developed oil field on a unit basis . The proposed suit would apparently prohibit such activities , many of which are now carried out under the supervision of the Department of the Interior . These unit plans are deemed a major force in conservation since they reduce the number of wells to be drilled , conserve gas or hydrostatic pressure and otherwise conduce toward scientific production . This , of course , means lower investment costs per barrel of ultimate production and insures generally lower production costs and higher ultimate recovery of oil . " The Horns of a Dilemma Jackson ignored these findings . Instead , the suit seeks to make illegal the conservation measures which have been approved and instituted by the various oil-producing states and the Department of the Interior , and to prohibit any further efforts at conservation on the part of the oil companies themselves . This would seem highly illogical if it were not for tile fact that the Cole Bill seeks to take over control of the oil industry on the ground that it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit would see to it that the industry would not he allowed to practice conservation on its own . This is indicated by Jackson himself in a letter concerning the antitrust suit to Sen. Guy M. Gillette , of Iowa , in which he urged Gillette to press congressional legislation in regard to oil conservation and stated : " Only Congress can protect the future economic life of this country by protecting oil reserves in the ground . It has made several efforts to do so , some of which have failed . I believe more comprehensive plans could be devised now which would be successful . " The oil industry sees itself facing the possibility of the old pincer play  --  if it practices conservation on its own it is violating the antitrust laws ; if it does n't practice it the Government has the grounds to demand Federal control . As many oil men see it the Administration is using the national-defense program to provide additional minimnition for war on the oil industry .                @ @ @ @ @
