txt Consideration for Canada Urged I have just read something that has moved me to great admiration . In spite of what United States Senators say to make others believe Canada 's outpour. ing of life and treasure is only a " cash on the barrel head " gesture , Prime Minister Mackenzie King told Parliament at Ottawa yesterday that he would ignore the misrepresentation and trust to the intelligent people in the United States to correct statements that might be construed as slurs on his country 's patriotism and war effort . I wonder how many Americans know that in paying interest on all the millions they have borrowed from this country , Canada with its young men gone overseas in great numbers and its citizens shouldering heavy taxes is yet obliged to dig up 15 cents extra of their own money for every dollar they turn over to their American creditors . It does seem as though the men in Washington could have a little more consideration for the feelings of a courageous and honorable neighbor . PALn . V. D. HOYSRADT .
