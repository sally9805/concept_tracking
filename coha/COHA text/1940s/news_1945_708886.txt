txt Burned , blasted and seared , Nagasaki looked like a city of death today as this Flying Fortress brought newspaper and radio reporters to see at low level for the first time the effects of the atomic bomb dropped on this Japanese port of 253,0000 . An interior section of the city was literally disintegrated from the impact of this secret weapon , which was used against this urban industrial center on Aug. 9 ? one day before the Japanese Government broadcast its offer to surrender . This is destruction of a sort never before imagined by man and therefore is almost indescribable . Block after block of buildings , which were jammed together so closely that Nagasaki looked from the air in peacetime like a sea of roofs , has disappeared . The area where the bomb hit is absolutely flat and only the markings of the building foundations provide a clue as to what may have been in the area before the energy of the universe itself was turned loose to destroy the industrial potential of Japan . When we first came over Nagasaki this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living thing to be seen in the area along both sides of the Urakami River DEAD NAGASAKI IS SEEN FROM B-17 // where the bomb damage was con ..... entrated . We have now been flying over the city for nearly an hour at such a low level that the curiosity of the Japanese residents in the outlying sections has been aroused and they are pouring into the streets by the hundreds to watch our circling plane . Down in the harbor area , well beyond the area of danger of impact from the atomatic bomb , there is an Allied prisoner of war camp and in it we can see scores of demonstrating prisoners , some of whom are waving the tricolor of the Netherlands . We have just dipped in low and dropped some cigarettes to them . We would like to land and get from these prisoners their reaction to the atomic bomb that exploded so close , but unfortunately there is no airfield near by where this B-17 could be set down . A National Broadcasting Company correspondent on the flight over Nagasaki said two prisoners ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any effects of the atomic bomb blast by mountains that surrounded them . Damage Exceeds Russian Cities This trip , arranged by the United States Army Strategic Air Forces , is the first opportunity news men have had to see at first hand the destruction wrought by the atomic bomb . This correspondent , who has seen the worst damaged cities of Russia and of Poland , was stunned by the sight of Nagasaki below him . About 50 per cent of the town I seemed to have been completely wiped out , and the destruction in that area was worse than any the writer had seen in Stalingrad or Warsaw . , An arms factory is nothing but ' a mass of twisted girders . The wooden tinderbox houses which were jammed eve to eve have disappeared and all that remains are fragments that from the plane look about the size of match sticks . It is obvious that the flash when the bomb went off was great and covered a large area . On the sides of a rugged , treecovered hill that is close behind Nagasaki whole sections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River flows almost exactly through the center of the destroyed area . It was clear from the view we have had today that it was no barrier to the spread of fire and destruction . We have as yet no accurate re port on the number of persons who were killed and injured in the atomic bomb blast , but there is no doubt that industrial . Nagasaki was completely wiped out by the single bomb . Ridge Saved Part of City OKINAWA , Aug. 26 UPI  --  Lieut . Col. Clay Tice Jr. , of Phoenix , Ariz. , reported today that street cars were running in part of Nagasaki yesterday even though much of the Japanese city was flattened by the atomic bomb dropped on it Aug. 9 . Colonel Tice and Flight Officer Douglas C. Hall of Anamosa , Iowa , Fifth Air Force pilots , made forced landings on Kyushu Island yesterday and became the first Americans to land on Japanese home soil since hostilities ceased . Colonel Tice said he flew over Nagasaki at 1,500 to 2,000 feet . " I flew over another Japanese city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in France that looked as bad , " he reported . " Part of Nagasaki was completely flattened with one area bare , even of rubble , like an open field  --  probably where the main bomb blast was felt . But part of the city is protected from that area by a high ridge and in that part I could see street cars operating , school buildings standing and people moving on the streets . " Tice and Hall were on a reconnaissance mission when Flight Officer Hall 's P-38 developed fuelsystem trouble and they had to land at the Mittigahara airstrip on Kyushu . A B-17 flew in gasoline for Hall 's plane and all returned safely to their Okinawa base . " Radioactivity " Discounted The reports by ' the correspondents on the B-17 flight and by Colonel Tice regarding activity seen in the Nagasaki areas that were not directly affected by the atomic bomb blast , indicated that Japanese accounts last week of continued fatal " radioactivity " from the atomic bombing might have been somewhat exaggerated , observers here noted last night .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
