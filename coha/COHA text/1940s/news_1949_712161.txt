txt An eighth of a mile of Staten Island 's industrial waterfront was swept by a fire that set up a spectacular curtain of smoke over New York Bay yesterday afternoon . The fire , which did an estimated 3500,000 damage , was the island 's first five-alarm blaze since the St. George ferry house burned three years ago , to the day , with a loss of two lives . Two firemen received hospital treatment yesterday  --  one for burns and the other for smoke poisoning  --  and five others were treated on the scene for inhaling of smoke . Starting on an open pier , about one-qUaxter mile northwest of the St. George ferry terminal , the flames quickly consumed a car float , twelve coal cars and a boxcar , then spread . to two floating car bridges and set afire a floating hoist and two barges , which were towed blazing into the harbor . Sparks showered upon the roof and north wall of the warehouse on the Baltimore &; Ohio Railroad 's 1,000-foot Pier Six , providing a serious challenge to the firemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the freight pier , but streams from fireboats and constant wetting down by land-based firefighters removed that danger . Shifting winds sent great spirals of smoke , sometimes white and at other times black , around the island . Thousands of persons jammed the ferries from Brooklyn and Manhattan to get to the St. George hill for a. closer view . Staten Islanders who climbed the terraces brought the spectators to 35,000 during the two hours the blaze was at its worst . The fire started on the Baltimore &; Ohio 's coal pier . It was noticed by a woman in a terrace apartment who called the police at 3:07 P. M. The first fire call was a two-alarm , automatic for a waterfront blaze , bringing ten of the island 's twenty fire companies and one fireboat . By the time the first firemen arrived from Tompkinsville , at 3:15 , the flames had made such headway that a third alarm was sounded . The fourth and fifth alarms were sent at half hour intervals after that . as the conflagration threatened to get out of control . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen Manhattan companies , six from Brooklyn , and four more fireboats . Coast Guard cutters and picket boats and police launches raced to the scene , ready for rescue operations . A Coast Guard crew set up its portable pumper alongside the burning rail cars . Five B. &; 0 . tugs towed barges away from the area , and ten tugs of other companies veered from their courses in the Kill Van Kull and the Upper Bay to render aid . After the two burning barges and the hoist were towed into the Kill Van Kull , tugs stood by , pumping water into them , while the fireboats were occupied with the more urgent task of preventing the shoreline blaze from spreading . Fire Commissioner Frank J. Quayle , on the scene with Chief Peter Loftus and Assistant Chief of Staff William J. Hennessy , said at 4:30 P. M. that the fire was under control .

The two huge floating bridges , used for loading railroad cars onto floats , were buckled into fantastic shapes by the heat as their woodwork burned . Harry I. Walton , B. &; 0 . general superintendent in the New York district , estimated the loss at $500,000 . Mr. Walton said the fire may have started from spontaneous combustion in some soft coal on the pier , which is more than forty years old . There was no official determination of the cause , as there has been none of the cause of the ferry house fire of three years ago or of the blaze that destroyed the Pier Six warehouse on Jan. 21 , 1946 .
