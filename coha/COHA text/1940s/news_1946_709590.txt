txt FARMERS VIOLATING the " must sell " wheat order are n't likely to be prosecuted . This regulation requires that a wheat grower , within 15 days after he puts his grain in a public elevator , must sell half of it . Farmers are depositing their wheat in elevators ? then just not showing up to sell when their 15 days expires . Nothing is done about it . While Agriculture Department officials ca n't say so " on the record , " they are content to let farmers wait until Congress settles the price control ceiling question . Once that 's done , they believe , the grain will roll in. enabling them to quietly " dump " the unpopular order . But even if higher prices do not cause farmers to sell , it is doubtful that the ? must sell " edict will be enforced It LT more likely that some new " inducement " plan will be evolved to " jar the wheat loose .

BUTTER SCARCITY is likely to remain even if dairy products price ceilings go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creameries can make higher profits from selling their cream than from churning it into butter . Should dairy products be exempt from price control , Government butter experts estimate , butter would have to jump to about a dollar a pound to overcome the price advantage of cream now existing . And if . as the experts consider likely , fluid cream prices should advance simultaneously , butter would have to go above the dollar-a-pound level to keep its advantage . Consumer resistance to prices that high would discourage heavy volume production . the experts think .
