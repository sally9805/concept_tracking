From the War Production Board last week came an alarmed report : U.S. stocks and importations of tin are so low that they may be nonexistent by the end of 1946 . Since tin is vital to a host of industries , this might hobble reconversion . So WPB intends to keep a tight control over tin until large-scale importations from the Far East are resumed . <P> In its report , WPB explained that on last July 1 the U.S. had a total tin stockpile of only 95,572 tons . ( 1944 consumption : 89,500 tons . ) During the first six months of 1945 , tin was disappearing at " an even greater rate . " War 's end did not help : as military demand lessened , civilian demand soared . Warned WPB : unrestricted consumption " might easily reach a 120,000-ton rate and exhaust reserve stocks in a very short period . " <P> Actually , WPB may be painting the picture blacker than it really is . Its dire predictions are based on the still unproved belief that there is little possibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Far East ( Malaya , Burma , Siam , The Netherlands East Indies ) for two years-the time it takes to build , ship and set up dredging machinery . Tin experts think that hidden stocks of tin and Jap machinery still may be found there .
