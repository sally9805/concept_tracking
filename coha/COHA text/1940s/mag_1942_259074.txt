Nearly everybody else had already had his say on Admiral Jean Franois Darlan , when last week the Admiral decided to have a say for himself . He took great pains to repair his reputation . At the exotic Palais d'Et in Algiers he received correspondents individually and en masse . The Admiral was wearing sharkskin civvies with a white shirt , a brown polka-dot tie and black shoes . His grey-green eyes peered brightly through his horn-rimmed spectacles . Tiny veins threaded his florid cheeks . His grey hair was trimmed close . He sat behind a glass-topped work table in a dusky room hung with maps of Europe and Africa . Said he : <P> " In 1940 I believed an Axis victory was possible . In 1941 I believed no victory could be achieved by either side . But for several months now I have been convinced that Germany would lose . " <P> " Ptain and I. " In his new state of conviction , Admiral Darlan , granting that he had once publicly espoused collaboration with Hitler , said : " When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' in the sense that Marshal Ptain used it - namely , ' economic collaboration . ' Owing to the German occupation of France , no other policy was open to us . For , if we had refused such collaboration , all the workers of France would have been put out of their jobs and left to starve . Ptain and I never favored anything but economic collaboration , and then only under conditions then prevailing . But in military matters both Ptain and I absolutely refused to collaborate at all times . " <P> Admiral Darlan claimed no direct credit for scuttling the French Fleet at Toulon ; he did not pretend in this interview that he had ever thought of handing it to the Allies before they entered North Africa . Said he : " After the Armistice the Fleet had orders to scuttle their ships before allowing them to fall into alien hands . So long as I was in command , the order stood and was renewed from time to time . The current Laval government opposed that order . Therefore it was probably the Admiral Jean de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sink the ships . " Admiral Darlan agreed with British authorities ( TIME , Dec. 14 ) that the scuttling had immobilized most of the Toulon fleet . <P> Could the Germans ever persuade French sailors to take any salvaged ships into combat against the Allies ? Snapped Darlan : " Definitely not ! " <P> " Give the Weapons . " Last fortnight the official Radio Morocco proclaimed Admiral Darlan " Chief of State in French Africa . " Last week , using the more modest title of High Commissioner , he said : " The people of North Africa feel that America will liberate them from the Germans . They believe the coming of the Americans will mean a happier life for them . Our armed forces are anxious to fight against the Germans again . But they do not want to fight under conditions that prevailed in 1940 . They need tanks , planes and modern equipment . It would be in the best interests of the United Nations to give the weapons President Roosevelt said he would deliver . <P> " There is no question that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again on the side of the United Nations-on one condition . "
