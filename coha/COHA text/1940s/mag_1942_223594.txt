The U.S. citizen , a song in his heart and Pollyannery in his head , had a good laugh at Horrible Harold Ickes last year . Ickes huffed &; puffed and spread the alarm , but the filling-station pumps were always full . Oil-shortage talk , after fooling nobody , finally subsided . The U.S. told itself once again that there never could be an oil shortage , and thought it would be a good idea for Mr. Ickes to resign . <P> Even last month , when OPA announced gasoline rationing , nobody jumped . The first headlines were scary with predictions of 2-5 gallons a week . But this time even Horrible Harold rushed into print with reassurance . Sure , there would be rationing , but nothing like that . <P> This week 10,000,000 Eastern Seaboard motorists lined up to get gasoline-ration books and the terrible truth . Things were not just as bad as they looked ; they were worse . A third of the 10,000,000 , who did not need their cars for business or to get to work , got " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a little more . Even these rations were good only until July 1 ; then the amounts may be revised . <P> This time , when Leon Henderson called the three gallons for the nonessential motorist " a damned sight more than he 's entitled to , " nobody laughed . The song faded from the heart , Pollyannery from the head . Now the citizenry learned again the truth about total war : no matter how bad the experts say things are going to be , they turn out worse . <P> Goodby , Uncle Joe . It was the same with rubber . When Washington announced that there would be no new tires , it had softened the blow with quick talk of recaps . When it took away recaps , it talked about synthetics . <P> Last week real alarm crept up the citizen 's veins . Seven officials went before a Senate committee , painted a picture so black that it was veiled in military secrecy , and asked for power to requisition private tires and cars . <P> The bill was no joke . Said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a million tons of rubber on our highways now . That must be conserved . . . . Wasteful use of rubber will soon be a memory . The automobile petting parties will have to go . ... Our situation can become critical if the Sunday trips to see Uncle Joe are continued . I agree . . . that we must hold our tires as a public trust . " <P> Background for Pain . Washington had not been trying to kid the consumer-although unquestionably few officials could resist a little sugar-coating on hard facts . The plain truth was that nobody had foreseen the awful truth . <P> Oil estimates were knocked out by U-boats prowling the East Coast . The East normally uses 1,600,000 bbl. a day , 90% shipped by tanker ; now tankers would carry only a fraction of the load , and there was no way to fill the gap . The railroads , working valiantly , got last week 's shipments up to 640,000 bbl. a day ( see p. 73 ) . Pipelines and inland waterways added only 175,000 bbl. a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East was out of luck . Even under this week 's rationing system , the East will still use some 1,400,000 bbl. a day , including 250,000 bbl. a day required to replenish its low reserve stocks .
