Franklin Roosevelt 's oval second floor study had a festive air . Vases of white gladioli and chrysanthemums stood on the mantel . The big marble fireplace was banked with greens . Tall American Beauty roses stood in vases on his mahogany desk . As the hands of the old-fashioned French clock on the mantel neared noon , the President moved to a seat at the right of the fireplace . There he sat , while the 44 wedding guests arrived . <P> Into the flower-decked room came gaunt Harry Hopkins , his hair freshly trimmed , his blue business suit unwrinkled for the occasion . With him was the Rev. Russell J. Clinchy . In a hall the orchestra began the Lohengrin wedding march , dramatically stopped after the first four chords . Quick-smiling Mrs. Louise Macy entered on the arm of her brother-in-law , Navy Lieutenant Nicholas Ludington . She wore a simple deep-blue frock , with a matching halo hat that trailed a dark , waist-length veil . Her bouquet was purple orchids and delphiniums . <P> Dr. Clinchy , opening his Bible , stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little semicircle of 44 guests . Close by stood Hopkins ' ten-year-old daughter , Diana , wistful and pretty in a cocoa-colored crepe dress and a brown straw hat . While Harry Hopkins put a gold-rope wedding ring on his bride 's finger , little Diana held her new stepmother 's bouquet . <P> Nervous Harry Hopkins missed no lines , dropped no ring , scuffed no shoes . At 18 minutes after twelve , by the mantel clock , the ceremony was over . Franklin Roosevelt took " Louie " Macy Hopkins ' hand , kissed her on the cheek . <P> The guests crowded around to shake hands . Seven were relatives of the bride . Four were the children of Harry Hopkins by his two previous marriages , and Son David brought along his wife . There were 23 members of the White House staff . The only other guests : Mrs. Clinchy ; Playwright Robert Sherwood , who often lends a hand on White House speeches ; Presidential Adviser Samuel I. Rosenman ; General George C. Marshall , Admiral Ernest J. King . <P> At 12:30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House gold-and-silver service flashed in the noon sun . Tables were spread with platters of jellied salmon , jellied vegetable rings , hot chicken sandwiches , roast beef , a mountainous wedding cake frosted with signs of the Zodiac , doves and a big American eagle . Corks popped from magnums of champagne . President Roosevelt made a little speech . <P> The chicken and jellied salmon disappeared . The Meyer Davis orchestra , which has played dance music for every President since Woodrow Wilson , played tunes the bridal pair had requested . Bandleader Davis had even composed a new tune , A Song of Happiness , for the occasion . <P> Just before 2:30 , the President moved to his private study . The wedding celebration was over . The guests filed out . " Louie " and Harry Hopkins started on their honeymoon . <P> The White House wedding , fanciest of the day , was reported by brief communiques . The papers had plenty of space left to report other glamor weddings of the same day-notably : <P> In the glittering air of Colorado Springs , Count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married Mrs. Margaret Drayton , great-granddaughter of Mrs. William Astor herself .
