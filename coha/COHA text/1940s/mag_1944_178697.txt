The U.S. Army Air Forces thought it had the last word in quick surfacing for airfield runways when its engineers developed perforated steel mats . They have been installed on battlefronts all over the world , proved serviceable under almost all conditions . But their cost was terrific : a 5,000-by-150-ft. runway required 1,150 airplane ( C-47 ) loads of steel , 6,000 man-hours of labor . <P> Last week Air Forces engineers were glad to announce that they had a new emergency runway material with the essential advantages of steel mats . Known officially as PBS ( Prefabricated Bituminous Surface ) , it consists of a layer of cloth between two layers of tar-soaked paper . It can be carried in one-tenth the airplane space and laid , by machine , almost twice as fast . Spread over a rolled earth surface , the durable , water-repellent covering sustains the heat and shock of landings with little damage , bogs down only when subsurface moisture is extreme . <P> Developed by the Royal Canadian Engineers and improved by U.S. engineers , PBS was tried for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vital factor in the remarkable speed of air supply in France . By Sept. 1 , it had been used successfully on some 30 forward fighter and transport fields .
