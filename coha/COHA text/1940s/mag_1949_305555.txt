Japan 's Kabuki or People 's Theater is nowhere near as stuffy as the ancient and stylized No drama , but in 300 years , even the Kabuki has become a bit hidebound . Back in 1931 , Japan 's top Kabuki player , jut-jawed Actor Chojuro Kawarasaki , decided to liberate his art . <P> Like many a Broadway and Hollywood contemporary , Actor Kawarasaki had a tickling Marxian social conscience . He organized a new Kabuki troupe called the Zenshinza ( Forward-Looking Theater ) , set up shop in a sleek , modern playhouse outside Tokyo , defied tradition by hiring women actors to play female parts and began mixing Western dramas with the Japanese classics . When V-J brought democracy officially to Japan , Democrat Kawarasaki was ready with a full-fledged production of John Drinkwater 's Abraham Lincoln ( TIME , Feb. 25 , 1946 ) . <P> SCAP officials beamed in approval and Actor Kawarasaki followed this triumph with Lillian Hellman 's Watch on the Rhine and Shakespeare 's Merchant of Venice . Both were popular successes and financial flops . What with high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we still have to put on plays which , flatter the people who come . " <P> Last week Kawarasaki had a new audience to flatter . In the presence of fire-eating Party Secretary Kyuichi Tokuda ( who presumably had promised to foot the bills ) , Kawarasaki and 71 Zenshinza players joined the Communist Party . " After all , " explained the ex-emancipator , " Lincolnism and Marxism are not exactly the same , but they have many similarities . "
