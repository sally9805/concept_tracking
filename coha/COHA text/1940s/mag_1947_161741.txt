Oaxaca , dotted with old Spanish churches and circled by yet older Zapotecan pyramids , was a troublous city . Businessmen , with support of the people , had struck against the state government . Last week not a shop was open ( except for druggists and undertakers ) . The Institute of Arts and Sciences had closed its classes . A thousand federal troops patrolled the streets , blockaded roads leading into the city . Most of the 35,000 inhabitants-with women &; children in the van-paraded the streets in the sort of protest against local political bosses that was sweeping Mexico like a grass fire . <P> The flames had flared first last year in Leon , where trigger-happy soldiers killed 27 citizens demonstrating against a municipal government that had been " imposed " by bosses . Nationwide indignation drove the governor and mayor from office . Fire blazed again on New Year 's Eve when police killed ten demonstrators at Tapachula. on the Guatemalan frontier . There the governor took hasty leave of absence . <P> Underlying cause of it all : discontent with oldtime governors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the revolution , political support to the regime in Mexico City , but rule their own states for themselves and their relatives . The rise of a new type of governor interested in being a good public servant , in pushing good roads and building schools , has compounded the impatience . <P> Smart rightists-the tough , gutter-smart Sinarquistas and the smooth , book-smart Action Nationalistas-have made the most of it . They have jumped on the bandwagon , talked loudly about morality in government , have urged more popular participation in civic affairs . Presumably they have also egged on at least some of the public uprisings . In Oaxaca last week the crowd uncovered when orators spoke the name of Pornrio Diaz , president-dictator ( with a four-year break ) from 1877 to 1911 , and to many Mexicans a symbol of reaction and exploitation . <P> Washout . For President Miguel Aleman , the troubles posed a political dilemma . Whatever his lack of regard for the oldtime bosses , he still needed their support . Besides , he could not let the rightists make political hay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dec. 30 ) had paid off ; firmness in a political crisis like that at Oaxaca might pay dividends also . <P> Oaxaca 's title-loving Governor Edmundo Sanchez Cano ( who usually signs himself **29;11705;TOOLONG ) had been no administrative paragon . Examples : the road he built for President Avila Camacho 's 1946 visit had washed away with the first rains ; Oaxaca 's streets were in terrible shape ; enemies charged that tax revenues had vanished without trace . Last week Snchez ' police shot and killed five demonstrators at Etla , just outside Oaxaca . Aleman acted swiftly , sent his Minister of Interior to investigate . Sanchez resigned . In six other states , governors who were having their troubles shivered in their cavalry boots .
