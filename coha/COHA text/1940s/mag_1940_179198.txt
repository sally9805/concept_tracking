Fifteen years ago the State University of Iowa was an ordinary prairie university . Today it is climbing toward top rank among U. S. colleges . And last week the new Iowa got a new head . To succeed Eugene A. Gilmore , who retired last July at 69 , the State Board of Education elected as the University 's president a shy , handsome Chicago corporation lawyer named Virgil Melvin Hancher , 44 . <P> Virgil Hancher was a dark-horse candidate , but no stranger to lowans . Born on an Iowa farm , he got his A.B . and law degree at the State University , where he was a high scholarship man and president of his class , two years ago was president of the Iowa Alumni Association . He also went to Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar , got an M.A. there . No educator , he gave up a better-paid law practice to take the $12 , - ooo presidency , was chosen to give Iowa an efficient business administration . <P> Many an educator envied Mr. Hancher his job . Through the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River . The University buildings are on a gigantic scale : its field house contains a full-sized practice football field ; its indoor swimming pool is one of the largest in the U. S. On the river banks stand a Rockefeller-financed Medical College , a Rockefeller-financed theatre , a Carnegie-financed art building . Even more famed is Iowa 's Child Welfare Research Station . <P> A change in Iowa 's fortunes took place eleven years ago when famed Psychologist Carl Emil Seashore , grand old man of the University , decided that Iowa should go in for creative arts . In came Humanist Norman Foerster to head the School of Letters , Artist Grant Wood to teach in the School of Fine Arts . They believed that the way to learn about art was to produce it . Soon Iowa 's husky pupils were enthusiastically painting , sculpting , writing , acting , composing . Scornful of second-hand scholarship , Iowa 's teachers let students win their degrees by substituting for a traditional thesis an original novel , a painting , a performance in a play , a musical composition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Iowa City is the Athens of America . " <P> Last week lowans anxiously wondered how much help and encouragement President-elect Hancher would give to the University 's arts program . Mr. Hancher would only say : " It is my personal opinion that creative effort has a proper place in a balanced fine arts program . " Old Carl Seashore croaked : " A very fortunate appointment .
