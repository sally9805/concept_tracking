To answer some of the questions subscribers are asking about how TIME gathers , verifies , organizes and writes its news <P> There are a lot of new names among TIME 'S editors over there in the next column-and perhaps you would read the stories they write for TIME with a more personal interest if you knew something about them . <P> Some of these newsmen come to us with quite impressive records in the special fields they have been reporting . <P> For example , one of the newest writers in our Army and Navy department was for five years aviation editor of the Associated Press-for four years President of the Aviation Writers Association-has been in and out of practically all the big U.S. plane plants and training fields . He is a licensed pilot-and has flown more than 150,000 miles on assignment-to Alaska and Europe and all around the rim of South America . Probably he brings to his job a wider background knowledge of aviation-both in the flying field and the factory-than any writer in the country . <P> Another was in charge of music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Walter Damrosch 's closest associates . He wrote the music section of the Book of Knowledge and authored several distinguished books on music appreciation in his own right . His " Approach to Music " was described by Critic Leonard Liebling as " definitely the most understandable and useful thing of its kind . " <P> A recent addition to TIME 'S team of Business writers was for five years news editor of Business Week , played a major part in developing its original editorial plan-and has contributed regularly to the Saturday Evening Post and the Reader 's Digest for many years . . . . TIME 'S Science and Medicine departments now draw on the wide knowledge and experience of a journalist who for years was head of the chemistry and physics departments at one of the best known State universities in the country-who was Director of Science and Education at the World 's Fair-who edited a famous six-volume textbook series on the sciences . <P> Another of our new writers ( who speaks six languages and was educated in four countries ) was a foreign correspondent for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Economics in Washington before he came to TIME . And still another was with LIFE for five years , interviewed all the 1940 presidential candidates for TIME 'S sister publication , worked on some of LIFE 'S most famous feature stories , including those on the Windsors , Juan Trippe , Eugene Grace , etc . <P> I wish I had space to sketch the background of some of the other editors who have started to write for TIME in the past few months , but these will serve as examples of the kind of men and women TIME continues to attract . <P> The anonymity of TIME 'S group journalism often makes it hard for you to know just who writes what ( even TIME 'S Managing Editor sometimes ca n't tell ) . But I hope you feel that the end product of their work as it appears in TIME shows they are reporters who can think with authority in their chosen fields-and interpret that authority in cogent , succinct newswriting . <P> Cordially ,               @ @ @ @ @ @
