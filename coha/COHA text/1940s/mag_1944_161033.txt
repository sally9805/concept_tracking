Chicago 's Saddle &; Sirloin Club , famed hangout of U.S. meatpacking executives , got a notable gift last week . The gift : the 1 by 3 ft. original sketch of Rosa Bonheur 's nobly galumphing Horse Fair . The donor : doggy Mrs. M. Hartley Dodge , niece of John D. Rockefeller Sr. <P> The Saddle &; Sirloin is a luncheon club whose members still enjoy the best that the war has left them of their club 's world-famed steaks . The club also owns the world 's greatest collection of meat tycoons ' portraits . On its somber , paneled walls hang some 240 sumptuously framed , vigorously extroverted , mostly three-quarter-length portraits of the biggest breeders , killers , packers , meat sellers in the history of U.S. beef . <P> Bristles , Blood and Bones . There is Philip Danforth Armour , burnsided , frock-coated and wing-collared , an impassioned believer in human perfectibility who is supposed to have said : " I like to turn bristles , blood , bones and the insides and outsides of pigs and bullocks into revenue now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and girls who were supported by Armour funds , and they will go on forever . " There is curly-haired , German-Jewish Nelson Morris , who got his start by investing his savings in pigs whose legs had been broken in transit and who is supposed to have the best cattle-buyer 's eye in history . This is hotly disputed by admirers of Gustavus Franklin Swift , who is also prominently hung . There are gentler people like Wisconsin University 's goateed Dr. Stephen Moulton Babcock , to whom dairymen are forever grateful . He refused patents or profit on his butterfat-measuring Babcock Test . There is Herbert Hoover ; he was hung for his veto of legislation which would have hurt livestock men . <P> On other walls portraits of distinguished cattle share honors with the cattlemen . Among them : the Duke of Northumberland , " the best Shorthorn bull in all England in 1839 " ; a charming oil of a Guernsey cow with dainty pink nostrils and eyelids . There is a two-foot bronze sculpture of a Belgian horse by Rosa Bonheur 's gifted brother , Isadore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sirloin Club was founded in 1901 , to extend recognition to men who had made outstanding contributions to the livestock industry . Recognition , the founders decided , should take the form of a portrait of each member . The original portrait artist was James R. Stuart . He was followed by Arvid Nieholm . Most of their portraits were destroyed in the stockyards fire of 1934 , and Robert Grafton was commissioned to redo the lost canvases . After completing 100 portraits in two years , Artist Grafton dropped dead . Saddle &; Sirloin 's current portraitist is Othmar Hoffler . He has been at it for seven years .
