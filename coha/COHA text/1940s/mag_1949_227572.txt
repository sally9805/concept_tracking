More than half the population of the U.S. , about 77 million out of an estimated 148 million , are enrolled church members . In the 1949 edition of the Yearbook of American Churches , published last week , the Federal Council of Churches calls this the biggest such proportion in U.S. history . But Council Secretary Dr. Samuel Cavert ruefully notes that only 30% of the total membership-i.e. , 30% of the 46,000,000 enrolled Protestants , 25,000,000 Catholics , 5,000,000 Jews , 1,000,000 Eastern Orthodox-go to church with any regularity . " On the surface , at least , " says he dryly , " the U.S. appears to be a religious country . " <P> Stand Firm <P> Around a crude wooden table in an austere schoolroom sat nine men : an Englishman , a Dutchman , an Indian , a Norwegian , a Czech , two Germans , and two Americans . Their debate was on a major matter : What should the Protestant churches do about the Communist attack on religious freedom in Eastern Europe ? ( For the Vatican 's stand on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been appointed from among the 63 delegates to the first meeting , in Chichester , England , of the World Council of Churches ' central committee . Five of the nine were front-line veterans of the fight against totalitarianism . Pastor Martin Niemller had spent eight years in a Nazi concentration camp ; Norway 's Bishop Arne Fjellbu was a leader in his country 's wartime underground ; Dr. Hendrick Kraemer was a member of the Dutch resistance movement ; Germany 's Bishop Otto Dibelius , who fought the Nazis for ten years , is now fighting the Communists in the Eastern part of his diocese ; Dr. Joseph L. Hromadka of the Jan Hus Faculty of Theology in Prague , the only delegate from behind the Iron Curtain , is now walking an East-West tightrope . <P> Claims on the Whole Man . All agreed that the Protestant churches should speak out against Communist encroachments . The problem was , what could a group representing practically all of non-Catholic Christianity agree on saying ? <P> Bishop Fjellbu ( pronounced fyellboo ) warned against any " attempt to pass judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church , he said , should condemn " only a totalitarianism which makes claims on the whole man and seeks to restrict his religious freedom . " Bishop Dibelius , who referred to Western Berlin as " a fortress amid the Red Sea , " wanted strong language . <P> Prague 's Joseph Hromadka tried to explain that the situation in Eastern Europe is " both wider and deeper than the question of religious liberty . " These countries , said , are going through a total social , economic , and political transformation , and the churches " could not serve as a shelter for those who wish to retreat to the old social order . " In short , " the judgment of God lies upon the churches for having failed to meet the needs of the broad masses of people throughout the world . "
