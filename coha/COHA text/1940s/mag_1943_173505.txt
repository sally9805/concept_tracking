What kind of medical care does Ivan Ivanovich get if he is wounded ? Outside Ivan Ivanovich 's Russia , few facts on this subject were known until last fortnight . Then 1 ) a seven-man commission of U.S. and British doctors began to tell what they saw on a visit to the Soviet Union last summer , and 2 ) the first issue appeared of the American Review of Soviet Medicine , a bimonthly which will translate and digest Russian medical literature . <P> No Pampering . The doctors , four from Britain , two from the U.S. ( Colonel Elliot Carr Cutler and Colonel Loyal Davis ) , one from Canada , visited hospitals in Moscow and at the Vyazma front , talked with surgeons and patients . They were enthusiastic about Russian medical efficiency , though for diplomatic reasons all refused to be quoted directly . But highlights from their trip have been reported in their speeches and interviews and in the Lancet and the British Medical Journal : <P> &gt; Russia , which was once short of ambulances , now has mobile hospitals at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &gt;The Russian system often makes it possible for one doctor to follow a case from the operating room all the way to its cure . ( But , the Russians explain , a switch in surgeons usually causes no trouble , as surgical procedure has been standardized in a series of Red Army handbooks . ) <P> &gt;Soldiers get medical discharges from the Red Army with very little red tape . <P> &gt;Red doctors manage to function even behind German lines , secretly patch many guerrillas . <P> &gt; The Red Army 's inspector general ( with the rank of brigadier general ) is a woman . <P> &gt;Russian nurses have to be able to turn their hand to almost anything . The commission saw some of them putting up a new hospital ward in their spare time . One nurse fitted a window frame while they watched . <P> &gt; Mental casualties are almost unknown in the Red Army . The doctors claim that this mental health is due to lack of pampering of the wounded , high morale among the unwounded . <P> No Ineptitude , No Magic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ineptitude nor magic in Russian surgery . Russians , they said , excelled U.S. and British doctors in some respects , were not so good in others ( " We all observe the same principles and differ only in the details " ) . Some of these " details " from the doctors ' reports and the new Review suggest that Russia 's doctors have few inhibitions : <P> &gt; Russian surgeons use more whole blood than plasma for transfusions . They can do this because the blood-giving population is near the front . The blood is preserved by a special underground storage method , is thrown away if unused within three weeks . <P> &gt; Most surgeons in other countries are chary of interfering with a wound more than ten hours old , but Red doctors do not hesitate to operate even if a wound has gone ten days or so . They merely make sure to keep it open .
