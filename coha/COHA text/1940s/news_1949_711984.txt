txt The anxious and compassionate vigil which millions throughout the nation , personally and through thoughts and prayers , had kept for two nights and days for 3-year-old Kathy Fiscus came to a sorrowful end tonight . At 8:53 P. M. ( 11:53 New York time ) , after a doctor had been lowered to the 90-foot depth of the abandoned well shaft into which the child fell while playing Friday afternoon , it was announced that she evidently had been dead since soon after her fall . According to The Associated Press , it was stated that death was from drowning and the man who first reached the body said it " was upright and covered with water . " A formal statement from the parents . Mr. and Mrs. David Fiscus , declared : " There is nothing we can say to thank the people who helped by their many sacrifices . " At 9:50 , an hour after an announcement that she was dead , rescue worker William Yancey brought Kathy 's body to the surface and it was taken away in a hearse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought to an end one of the most intensive and widely watched rescue efforts ever conducted . Working with a battery of heavy equipment that half covered the six-acre vacant lot where the tragedy occurred , the volunteer rescue force of about seventy-five men ranging from high-salaried engineers to unemployed sandhogs had toiled with complete selflessness against heart-breaking natural obstacles , to undo the cruel fluke of fate . Their efforts , repeatedly frustrated by cave-ins , flooding and other difficulties , reached a climax at 6 o'clock tonight . As sorne.5,000 silent , and earnest onlookers pressed against the fences and police lines surrounding the tragedy 's site , two of the workers , 0 . A. Kelly and Homer Blickensderfer , working in . a cramped chamber at the bottom of a two-foot-wide rescue shaft , holed through the cast-iron lining of the old well shaft and sighted the little girl 's form . Hope surged , only to sag over the next few hours as her body was found to be too tightly wedged to extricate . Relays of Men Baffled Relay after relay of two-man teams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , descended the rescue shaft without success . Finally , at 8:20 , Dr. Robert McCullock , who had stood by throughout the fifty-hour rescue operation , was lowered to the bottom to examine the girl . A half hour later , after he had communicated by telephone with the surface , and with Dr. Paul Hanson , another family doctor whip had delivered Kathy , Dr. Hanson walked over to the Fiscus home twenty-five-yards away and presently returned to announce over an amplifier to the crowd : " I am not only the Fiscus family doctor but also a ? close friend . Kathy is dead and apparently has been ever since she was last heard speaking Friday ( about 6 P. M. ) . " The family has been notified and now we are notifying you . Dr. Robert McCullock has pronounced Kathy dead and is assisting in the removal of the body . " For the sake of the family , which has held up so gallantly through this ordeal , and for all the people who have aided so magnificently , we ask you to please leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . P " If : his had been your child I am sure you would not want a crowd remaining at the scene of the tragedy . " The statement was received in hushed and saddened silence by the throng , which through the hot days and chill nights had waited in tense silence and hope , reflecting the sympathy of a nation . The people started slowly walk- ing away into the night , with slumped shoulders and bowed heads . At 7 P. M. , an hour after rescue workers had holed through ninetyfive feet underground into the fourteen-inch abandoned well shaft into which the little girl fell while playing , Raymond Hill , the engineer supervising the operation , announced that the girl had been reached . She was wedged tightly in the shaft , however , so that it was impossible to extricate her immediately and Mr. Hill had no word on whether she was alive or dead . A sling seat , like a bosun 's chair , was lowered by crane down the 24-inch rescue shaft paralleling the well shaft , but in a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretcher was lowered , only to come up a few minutes later , likewise empty . Suspense and anxiety mounted to an almost palpable tautness among the thousands of onlookers crowding against fences and police lines which encircled the dusty , sun-baked area throughout a torrid day and into the coolness of the evening . Water Seepage Slowed Work The rescue effort , although pressed feverishly throughout last night , was retarded by technical difficulties for hours until almost noon today . Water seeped into the cramped 5-foot by 3-foot chamber at the bottom of the rescue shaft where members of the rescue force spelled one another . The shaft walls kept caving in . But the problem ultimately was solved by shoring with heavy timbers and lowering of the water level by means of pumps a quarter of a mile away . In mid-afternoon the rescuers dug through to the iron pipe lining the old well shaft and began a three-hour operation of cutting a " window " in it with pneumatic saws and drills . Working at the bottom were Mr. Kelly and " Whitey " Blickensderfer , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening Mr. Blickensderfer , who had toiled throughout the rescue effort , was taken to the hospital with the " bends . " For the most part as the work went on the people stood silently in a manner which could be described only as " reverent . " But there was cheering and applauding when successive two-man rescue teams , relieving one another in the grim and arduous underground work , were pulled by a crane from the mouth of the rescue shaft 's casing , which towered some fifteen feet in the air . Like miners , they were lowered and raised in a bucket , or occasionally in a parachute harness . On the lot were three extra cranes , a waiting ambulance , several oil pipe trucks , an air-compressor unit , two television trucks and radio cars . The brown sedan in which Kathy 's parents had spent much of the long vigil disappeared from the lot at midday as their family doctor ordered them to rest in bed in their home near by . Under a shade umbrella a man cranked away hour after hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to where the little girl lay . Under another group of umbrellas was a first-aid station , where the rescue workers , as they emerged from the shaft , rested on stretchers on the ground and were treated with cold compresses . Abandoned was the yawning 75-foot hole which marked the first rescue attempt . From this shaft a " window " ? was cut in the well casing yesterday to provide the first glimpse of the child . This window was at the 57-foot level , The new narrow rescue shaft was close beside this and immediately adjacent to the original old well shaft . Under an umbrella reporters huddled around an amplifier connected with the microphone at the bottom of the rescue shaft . Over this speaker could be heard clearly the work and remarks of the men at the bottom . First there would be sounds of hammering and drilling , then a silence . Then would come distinctly words like : " Hello up there  --  send the bucket down with the other set of tools in it * * * where is the chuck wrench for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drill about every two inches * * * please send down the other bucket of tools * * * " The sounds from the deep rescue pit boomed intermittently across the lot also from a loudspeaker in the cabin of the main crane where operator Nick Phillips , who put in twenty straight hours digging the first unsuccessful rescue hole , was back at the controls . Western Union messenger boys filtered among the swarm of observers , delivering telegrams of encouragement and advice which poured in from at least forty states . The messages were addressed to rescuers whose names had become known through news stories . Attention of those at the scene was focussed on " Whitey " Blickensderfer , grizzled unemployed construction worker who cut the first unsuccessful " window " into the well shaft yesterday from the rescue pit later abandoned . Under the only clump of shade trees on the lot the American Red Cross chapters of San Marino , Pasadena and Altadena served thousands of sandwiches , cold drinks , cups of coffee and candy bars to those working within the police lines .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
