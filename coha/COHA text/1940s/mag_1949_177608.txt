As commencement speaker at the University of Miami , Editor Ralph McGill of the Atlanta Constitution was filling an uneasy role . " I am not sure I approve , " he said , " of the tradition which calls for a commencement address ... It has sometimes been my idea that instead of a speaker offering sage advice , it would be a far better idea to place before a graduating audience a fine symphony ... or a magnificent ballet , and when this had been completed , to say ; ' Ladies and gentlemen , life can be very lovely or very sad . It probably will be a mixture of both . . . Goodbye , and God go with you . . . ' " <P> Many Americans would agree with Editor McGill that there was really little more that a commencement speaker could say , but last week , at graduations all over the U.S. , noted men &; women were trying . Luther Evans , Librarian of Congress , feared that his speech would seem " the final discipline , the ultimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to Atlanta University 's class of ' 49 .

For other speakers there were other worries . What to say in the face of so uncertain a future ? " The ruins are plain to behold , " cried President John S. Kieffer of St. John 's College .

" <P> Another fear bothered U.S. Senator Frank P. Graham , speaking at , the University of North Carolina ( of which he was president until he went to the Senate last March ) . The fear of Russia , he warned , could lead Americans " to subvert our free institutions ...
