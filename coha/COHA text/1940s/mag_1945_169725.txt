Internationalism 's grand old man , Jan Christian Smuts , had evidently pondered the recent upsurge of British pity for defeated , miserable Germany ( TIME , Nov. 5 ) . Last week , in a speech at Capetown , Field Marshal Smuts said what pitying British M.P.s had neglected to say in their House of Commons debate : <P> " You see today a ruined Europe . If tomorrow you hear of suffering , disease , starvation and death on a large scale unknown before in times of peace , remember that that was in the first place the curse of Hitler and in the second place the dreadful responsibility of the German people who allowed such a monster to become their master . <P> " The dreadful responsibility rests on us to do all we can to save what can still be saved . But do not forget where the chief responsibility lies . "
