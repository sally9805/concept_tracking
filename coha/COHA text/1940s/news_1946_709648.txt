A smaller number , who consider themselves more farsighted , see at least this advantage : That Germany stands to gain later through becoming the subject not merely the - object of international policy . Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav M. Molotov 's reference to " no peace of revenge " is naturally a phrase which was ' eagerly seized upon by the defeated people , and one need not be a prophet to say it will be much , heard in speeches of politicians during the coming months . Germans Bewildered At the same time , the Germans are bewildered as to which particular members of the Big Four are out for such a Carthaginian peace .

That this German unity means territorial unity within a Germany from which the Soviet Union already has secured all it wants in the way of frontier rectification is generally realized  --  though it would be a mistake to imagine the Germans have forgotten the loss of their eastern provinces to Poland . Concerning reparations , the Germans feel that today they are in such a hopeless financial and economic situation that it is immaterial what sum is fixed . They conclude that , as after World War I , the rest of the world somehow or other will have to do the paying . " Why worry about this $10,000 , - 000,000 for which Russia is asking ? " one German economist frankly declared . " The French and Czechs and the rest will also have colossal claims to make . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
