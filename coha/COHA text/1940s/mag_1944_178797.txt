Flying over southeast Asia , Major Walter V. Radovich began to think about his 18-months-old son - and also about God . The Major was a crack fighter pilot . He had shot down four Jap planes , had flown through a defile not much wider than his plane 's wings to blow up an enemy munition train , had won the Distinguished Flying Cross . But there was something on the Major 's conscience which would give him no rest . <P> In Manhattan last week U.S. Attorney John F. X. McGohey told the rest of the story : Radovich finally went to his commanding officer and confessed that he had once accepted bribes to save two other soldiers from duty overseas . Radovich was only half a jump ahead of an investigation already under way . But he was obsessed with the idea that God would punish him by punishing his son , he said . He made a clean breast of it . <P> These were details of Radovich 's wrongdoing , by McGohey 's account : <P> In February 1943 , when Radovich was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mitchel Field to organize a unit for the China-Burma-India air war . There he became acquainted with two brothers , Samuel and Elias Bayer and their nephew Jerome Usdan , thread manufacturers of New York . Samuel Bayer 's son Martin , 22 , and Usdan 's brother Morris , 21 , were both privates at Mitchel Field . <P> Radovich was wined &; dined , presented with tailored uniforms and gifts for his wife and son , $7,000 which he invested in war bonds . Twice he saved Martin and Morris from being sent overseas by having them temporarily transferred to his own unit . In January , Radovich himself went overseas ( though he had to persuade his commanding officer to overlook a minor leg injury ) and played a hero 's role in the CBI until his conscience overtook him . <P> Sent home , the remorseful Radovich sold his war bonds and gave the money to the Army . Last week he was under detention at Mitchel Field . Martin Bayer was still in the U.S. in spite of everything . Cousin Morris was overseas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspiracy to corrupt an Army officer , FBI agents were looking for Samuel and Elias Bayer , wanted on the same charge .
