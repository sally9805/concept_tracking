txt Mayor O'Dwyer assailed last night as " unconscionable " a statement by G. Howland Shaw , president of the Welfare Council of New York City , listing various social and health needs of the city . While admitting " there may be deficiencies which require correction , " the Mayor made public a point-by-point answer citing the accomplishments of his administration in health , welfare , hospital and recreation services . Earlier the Mayor had announced that four of his commissioners had resigned from the board of directors of the Welfare Council . They were Edward E. Rhatigan , Commissioner of Welfare ; Dr. Edward M. Bernecker , Commissioner of Hospitals ; Dr. Israel Weinstein , Commissioner of Health , and James B. Nolan , Sixth Deputy Police Commissioner . A denial that his enumeration of " some twenty well-known problems W. POTTER in the welfare and health field " was intended as criticism or blame " of any individual or group , public or private " was made by Mr. Shaw promptly after the commissioners ' joint letter of resignation had been received at the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters to the commissioners Mr. Shaw appealed to them to reconsider and in a letter to the Mayor he urged him to use his " good offices in helping to adjust this unfortunate misunderstanding and to promote continued cooperation between the city authorities and the Welfare Council . " The Mayor issued his statement and answer after receipt of Mr. Shaw 's communication . Accepting the Shaw statement , which had been reported in Monday 's newspapers , as - an attack on his administration , the Mayor said he was " astounded by the failure of the Welfare Council to recognize the substantial progress that has been made under my administration in improving these conditions and the plans which are under way to effect still further improvements . " " The Welfare Council is well aware of these facts , " the Mayor said , " and for a responsible organization to issue a one-sided statement on these matters instead -. of submitting a balanced portrayal of the total picture in the City of New York is , to my mind , unconscionable . " The Mayor cited figures to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hospital and Park Departments this year total $193,320,725 , compared with $131 , - 865,400 in 1944-45 , before he took office , a rise of 46.6 per cent . In their joint letter to Mr. Shaw , the four commissioners characterized his statement as it appeared in the " TIMES and other daily papers " as " outrageous and unconscionable " and said they were resigning and had ordered all their department staff members to take no further part in the council 's activities . For a person in the position of leadership inherent in the office of president of the council to make no recognition of the " vast strides " made in Mayor O'Dwyer 's administration in health and welfare was , they said , " irresponsible . " They could no longer feel justified as public officials in continuing to be members of an organization " which pursues such a reckless course , " they wrote . Shaw Denies Criticizing City A letter from Mr. Shaw , who was in Washington yesterday , was sent promptly to the commissioners . Mr. Shaw wrote that his remarks had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start a new unit in the council 's organization . The letter said : " There was no thought throughout the proceedings of criticizing or blaming any individual or group , public or private . Full recognition was given at the outset of my remarks to the extent of the welfare services of the city . Far from being an original and irresponsible pronouncement , as you seem to have been led to believe , every one of the problems I mentioned has been mentioned before and was lifted from reports of official departments , Welfare Council Committee reports and other authentic sources of information . I am prepared to place before you or before nyone else the documents to which I refer . " I am reluctant to believe that the mere enumeration of some twenty well-known problems in the welfare and health field in the City of New York , as in part reported in the press , is sufficient to lead ' some of the highest officials of the city to resign from the board of an organization , the purpose of which is to inform the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together public and private agencies in a common effort to find solutions . " Papers Quoted Release The meeting to which Mr. Shaw referred was held last Friday at the Gramercy Park Hotel , called for the organization of a central coordinating committee . The newspaper reports he referred to , however , were based on a press release sent out by the office of the Welfare Council . That release contained a paragraph favorable to the city and the Administration , as follows : " Mr. Shaw said that while there is no real cause for alarm at the public 's complacency about social conditions , it must be remembered that New York stands high among American cities in its organization of social and health services , public and voluntary . " On returning last Monday from a speaking engagement in Topeka , Kan. , Mayor O'Dwyer asked Commissioner Rhatigan for a detailed report on Mr. Shaw 's statement as reported in the day 's newspapers . After newspapers reported this action by the Mayor , Mrs. Richard J. Bernhard , first vice president of the Council , wrote letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " unfortunate that a statement which assessed no blame on any public or-.private social agency " should have been " misconstrued as an attack on , the New York City Administration . " " No such attack was intended or implied , " she wrote . Mrs. Bernhard said last night that the story of Mr. Shaw 's statement in THE TIMES of Monday was accurate and . had not misinterpreted its meaning . She said the headline , " Welfare Council Sees Laxity in City , " might . Je " misconstrued . " Denies Family Break-Up Point In his report to the Mayor on the Shaw statement , Commissioner Rhatigan , in reply to the point that ' families are breaking up because of the housing shortage as parents request placement for their children , said that no family is sepa- , rated because of the housing shortage and that the city had gone to the unusual expense of hiring hotel rooms until more permanent arrangements could be made . On the point that hospitals reported there were no plans for the care of one out of three unmarried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge was unwarranted , as the Welfare Department was prepared to help such mothers to find a home for provide shelter-care . On the point that relief allowances &re; below minenum decent living standards , he said that in addition to monthly relief checks families received complete medical service , clothes and other special grants . Allowances were increased 30 per cent last year . On the charge that public assistance cases have increased sharply , the Commissioner said he was proud the administration 's policy was to take care of every person in need . On the point there was no place where a homeless or unattached boy , 16 to 20 years old , could be sent for a night 's lodging except to jail , he said there was no satisfactory place to send them , but that the situation had been aggravated by the recent closing of two private shelters . Probation Officers ' Pay In reply to the charge that pro-1 bation officers have a starting salary of $1,800 , or $200 less than the minimum for sanitation workers , he said this was " unfair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was $2,460 . Admitting that the deaths of twelve teen-age boys in gang street fights was " tragic , " he said the administration has expanded its juvenile delinquency program . He said the administration had no accepted Mate funds under the- State Youth Act because there was no assurance the state would continue its program . More summer camps were needed , he said , but pointed out this had been a recognized function of private philanthropy . The rise of venereal disease cases was attributable to the war , he said , adding the city spends over $750,000 on such cases . On the desperate need for psychiatric resources for all age groups in all parts of the city , he said this was true , but that it would take many years to provide such facilities . The care of mentally defective children was the responsibility of the state government , he said . Deaths in tenement fires are due to a need for more low-cost public housing . Discrimination in employment is a state problem , and lack of family case workers in Brooklyn is a responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
