 | SYDNEY flashed fighting spirit as war exploded the Pacific harbor . Never before had an enemy rocked this cradle of the continent . Sneaking along the darkened water front of Australia 's largest city , Japanese suicide squads of the deep approached objectives like stealthy sharks . Alert harbor patrols bore down and blasted them . Four midget submarines from Nippon submerged for the last time ( opposite page ) . A torpedo fired from one of the invading craft sank a naval depot ship . Houses on the battle front shook ; windows were shattered . Searchlights and tracer bullets split the sinister backdrop of night . With crashing suddenness detonations from depth charges and guns roared war to Sydney . To me , and to thousands of others who first heard explosions booming up from the harbor and saw frantic flashes of high-powered lights , it all meant simply ' practicing again . ' ' Few of us had really felt that a hostile attack so far south was imminent . Sydney Harbour a Focus of Pacific Strategy Sydney Harbour has a strategic position on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipping on an enormous scale , plus naval dockyards . Also , it is the focal point of a wide-reaching railway network . Already a leading world haven for sea and aircraft in peacetime , Sydney seethed with increasing wartime traffic to and from the United Nations . Its central location in an area of vast , heavy industries stimulated its own manufactures . Commercially and financially , Sydney was to the cities what sheep were to the country . Yet , until recently , its growing population of more than a million and a quarter , including refugees from China and the Philippines , Malaya , the Netherlands Indies , and north Australia , thought of Sydney as the " Pleasure City of the South Seas . " Twice by steamship and half a dozen times by train have I arrived in the capital of New South Wales . It always excited me the way New York did . It was big ; it was busy ; it was expensive . I last returned four months after Pearl Harbor . Driving from station to hotel , I found myself saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a war on . " Some characteristics of Sydney the playground could never change . But with Japanese war birds hovering in the near north , swooping on Darwin , and fluttering over Townsville in the next State , the fun-loving metropolis began a transformation. * The middle-aged assistant manager of the hotel paused before leaving the room . " If there is anything I can do for you in the next two days before I must report to a military camp . . . " and he closed the door quietly behind him . Under the glass top of my bureau glared brown-out notices , how-to-act-in-air-raid advice , and a statement that night shoe-cleaning service was discontinued because of shortage of staff . Many of the hotel employees had gone to camp . Giant Australia Grew Up in 150 Years Little more than 150 years ago Australia was virtually unknown territory . In 1788 Capt . Arthur Phillip , R.N. , with eleven sailing ships landed at Sydney Cove one of many bays and baylets in Port Jackson ? to found the first permanent settlement in the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the British Home Secretary , for whom he named the cove , I have had the satisfaction of finding the finest harbour in the world . " Actually , Capt . James Cook arrived in Australia 18 years ahead of Phillip , but he did not linger . He sailed into Botany Bay , ten miles south of Sydney Cove , in April , 1770 , and took possession of the eastern part of the continent . Sighting the bay which is now Sydney Harbour , but not pausing to explore it , he called it " Port Jackson " in honor of the then Secretary to the Admiralty . Today this name means little save to cartographers and nautical-chart readers . Since Governor Phillip 's early settlement , his diminutive group of huts has grown into a modern metropolis , second in size only to London among the " white " Imperial cities : and , even before the war , fifth port of the British Empire . Circular Quay , fringing Sydney Cove where Phillip landed , is the heart of the port , the home base of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22 square miles or skirt nearly all of its 188 miles of shore line . Harbour Bridge , the world 's heaviest and widest of the arch type , was opened to traffic in 1932 ( Plate IV ) . It accommodates four lines 362 The National Gec  | of electric railway , six lanes for vehicles , and two footways . The colossal causeway , which resembles a gigantic coat hanger , can handle 138 trains , 6,000 automobiles ( from moving vans to baby Austins ) , and 40,000 pedestrians in one hour . To understand the growth of Sydney , imagine in the beginning large land grants on the city 's borders . With the increase in population , these grants , subdivided and sold , became villages . They , in turn , grew into municipalities , eventually suburbs , and finally parts of Sydney . The metropolis occupies an area of approximately 120,000 acres ? nearly three times that of the District of Columbia . In gangling youth , growth sometimes takes a crazy course . Looking at Sydney 's twisted , narrow streets , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason for the crooked streets is that bullock carts hauling building stone could not take grades head on , and home and businesshouse construction was too urgently needed to wait upon straight-line transportation . Up from the very harbor water rise private homes and apartment houses , interspersing peaceful parks and just plain " bush . " Except for necessary wharfage to accommodate an endless cavalcade of world-wide shipping , much of the populated waterside is residential . Even in wartime it seemed to me natural for 30,000 Sydneyites to gather at a race track , swamp the bookmakers , and storm the totalizator . Over week ends I have watched fleets of trim , bright pleasure yachts , full sails gleaming in the sun , breeze past dull-toned destroyers , camouflaged cruisers , and troopships ghostly as fog . So common were football matches in the parks that on a walk I passed them by to watch elderly men at bowls . And , despite the approach of winter , I met youths swinging bathing suits and towels , bound for one of several magnificent beaches close by . Families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gardens , or lounging in the sun . At the hotel I marveled at the throngs gathered merely for congeniality . Aside from men and women in uniform , the only reminder that Australia was at war came with an airraid test ; and that seemed not to interfere noticeably with life in this city of pleasure . The change from untroubled ease to intense war awareness came overnight , affecting people , factories , and transport ; small shops , big department stores , and homes : leisure , labor , and living conditions ; even university education . Most telling , yet quietest , was the swing of many industries from wholly commercial enterprise to all-out war production . Through a high officer of the Chamber of Manufactures I received entrees into factories working for war . " What industries , if any , would you call peculiar to Sydney ? " I asked . " None that I know of , " he replied . " The city 's industries are generally like its population cosmopolitan . " Until this war Australia had been concerned principally with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For her finished goods she relied to a great extent on England . The Commonwealth now has her own airplane factories , and plants for turning out guns and ammunition . She makes Bren gun carriers , Army trucks , and other vehicles for armored units . Shipyards are busy . Some factories specialize in the manufacture of precision parts and the assembly of delicate detectors used for defense against sea or air invasion . Sydney stays in step ( page 361 ) . Falling into military line , a manufacturer of tennis rackets , tennis balls , and golf clubs switched to stock butts and all the woodwork that goes into standard service rifles and Bren guns . The tennis-ball rubber was diverted to civilian gas masks , and the former golf department followed through with sturdy wooden cases for Bren guns . I have seen the same turnover from commercial to war production in numerous other businesses . A factory formerly concerned with meters , electric refrigerators , fans , etc. , now makes airplane predictors of 20,000 parts each , cartridge-gauging machines , primers , parts for Beaufort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shell exploders , metal elements for training planes , and a dozen other little things like carburetors , magnetos , and genometers . The plant has also taken over an annex for the manufacture of a new type of armorpiercing bullet . Sydney Cloth for Yankee Uniforms Using the clip of half a million sheep in one year , woolen mills I visited produced 750,000 yards of cloth for military , naval , and Air Force requirements . Each week this firm furnished thousands of pounds of yarn for Army sweaters , socks , underwear , puttees , bunting for naval flags , and fingering wool for Red Cross use only . I even watched men sort fleece specifically for American soldiers . At a hat factory I appreciated for the first time that rabbits were , after all , of some value  | to the country in which they have created such a national problem for graziers . The real " Digger " hat ( the Australian soldier is nicknamed " Digger " ) , most distinguished feature of the Aussie 's uniform , is made of rabbit fur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; yet the hat sells for only 10 shillings . For a peacetime hat fewer skins are needed . War has turned profit into loss ( page 365 ) . I had a morning in a boot factory which had ceased altogether stitching and heeling for civilians . It concentrated on 4,000 pairs of marching models a week for Imperial forces in India alone . I happened to be at an auto-assembly plant when Mr. William S. Wasserman , leader of the Lend-Lease delegation to Australia , arrived . Turning to me , the firm 's manager of war production excused himself . Hurriedly he left the office where we had been talking in terms of 25-pounder guns and the 110 military vehicles that rolled off the assembly line every day . In his haste he forgot , I thought , to put on his suit coat . When the manager returned , I asked whether he had intended to go down in his shirt sleeves to meet the distinguished visitor . " Why , certainly , " he said simply . " There 's not enough time these days to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The work that 5,000 employees were accomplishing at another factory which supplied all fighting services with radio transmitting and receiving equipment was impressive enough in itself . To think that the company had absolutely eliminated civilian commercial enterprise since the outbreak of hostilities reveals even more . And to know that some of Sydney 's best air-raid trenches and shelters on the premises could accommodate a complete shift 4,000-odd workers ? shows how seriously industrialists were taking this war . Women Do Their Part But how did Sydney people react generally ? An ever-increasing number of men in uniform was to be expected . The situation struck home to me when I was summoned to report for military medical examination at an Australian depot . I learned that I was of little use with a broken leg . To keep abreast of mobilized manpower ,  | women have volunteered magnificently . Apart from enlisting in the W. A. N. S.* or W. A. A. A. F. , f becoming military nurses , working for the Red Cross , or joining the land armies , they established canteens and clubs all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Down near Circular Quay women operated a Navy Club wholly on a voluntary basis . From 11 o'clock in the morning to 11 at night the building welcomed any Allied sailors . A restaurant on the ground floor was open to the public as well as seamen ; but Navy men paid less , and only they could take advantage of recreation rooms upstairs . Looking around one of their club restaurants , I saw American , Australian , English , and Dutch , Free French , Indian , and Javanese sailors and soldiers . Civilians were there also . When dishes , dining room , and kitchen were in order , the women moved upstairs to entertain the sailors , who often liked to speed things along by assisting with the general clean-up below . Singing , playing cards , or dancing , all nationalities passed the evening together . Once a month the club staged a grand party ; the girls in fragile frocks danced with anyone in a briny blouse ? dark Hindus or fair-headed Dutch . In a poorer section of the city I passed an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factories and shops , mothers entrusted children , aged one month to 6 years , to a permanent staff of 20 women , plus a variable number of volunteers . Nursery attendants supervised rest and play periods ; instructed in such simple occupations as drawing , painting , cutting out , weaving ; fed and washed as many as 100 infants a day between 7 a. m. and 6 p. m. ( page 363 ) . As ever greater numbers of men vacated civilian jobs to serve the military , women filled their places . Everybody Eager to Do His Bit Recently , newspapers have printed articles about the requests of women to take on jobs of railway porters and streetcar conductors . And I have seen uniformed messenger girls on motorcycles , looking as much at home in their saddles as they would in party frocks.  | I did not have to follow bread carts through factory districts , or motorcycles up and down heavily trafficked Pitt and George Streets to appreciate the transformation of Sydney . At Government House Mr. Peter Lubbock welcomed me into the First Family of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Wakehurst , Governor of New South Wales . Lady Wakehurst was Peter 's sister . As official air-spotter for Government House , Peter passed hours each day on the crenelated roof of the Tudor-style mansion , his binoculars alert for enemy planes . In the event of a raid , he had to stick to his post with telephone at hand to advise ground forces where fires broke out , etc . He told me he did n't at all mind the job ; but he did object to not being issued a steel helmet . When he was on the verge of searching the viceregal kitchen for a sturdy basin to serve the purpose , a friendly American Army officer stationed in Sydney arranged with a U. S. quartermaster to provide a tin hat . The British nobleman is thus under American " protection . " At the University of Sydney I found a group of premedicos digging slit trenches in front of the main administrative building . " Just about every student ? man and woman ? is an active member of our Air Raid Precaution unit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And most of the women , " he continued , " are doing some sort of war work within the University ? Voluntary Aid Detachment , Red Cross , first aid in general , fire fighting , camouflage netting , and knitting . " " So far this year , " said Sir Robert Wallace , Vice Chancellor of the University , " more than one-third of the men have dropped out to enter military services ; and they are still dropping . Even some of the women abandoned university careers for war work . In normal times we have 4,000 students , 3,000 of them men . " Even a Macquarie Street masseuse , after arranging my injured leg for a phase of shortwave induction , settled down to the weaving of a camouflage net . Those crowds I first saw on returning to Sydney would no longer reflect in unprotected shop windows . Virtually all stores , large or small , have thrown up board fronts , removed glass altogether , or applied nonshatterableglass coatings or tape stripping ( Plate V ) . Walls of sandbags have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and office buildings have barricaded their doors and lower windows with solid brick . Barbed wire on beaches snarls at the breakers ; rocky headlands bristle with pickets . Piers on the coast have been blown skyward and seaward to eliminate stepping stones to invasion . Tank-trapping thoroughfares thoughtfully display " Road Closed " signs . The yachts with full sails still gleam in the harbor ; but now they are sailed by members of the Air Force going through routine training . The boats have been volunteered by private persons for the purpose . Double-decker buses big as bungalows and fuel-tank trucks long as locomotives have shed bright red paint for coats of camouflage like that on military vehicles . The bridge at night hangs over the harbor like a threatening storm . I approached it by ferry ; could not see the structure until almost directly beneath . Like thunder in black clouds , traffic roared overhead . And lights on crossing trains , trams , and autos were dim as distant flicks of lightning . Sydney Can Feed Itself In the suburbs posy-loving folk uprooted roses to plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The American Consul General replaced his terraced flower garden with vegetable patches . No starving in Sydney , but chain smokers suffered enough missing links to seem almost abstemious . You just could n't buy tobacco unless you had a friend who was the friend of a friend who . . . etc . Petrol petered out for civilians at the crack of the gun ; it remained the favorite lament of wartime rationing . Two-car tycoons took to trams . Austin owners pushed or coasted wherever possible , despite the little engine 's reputed 40 miles to the gallon . Most delivery trucks did not deliver . Taxis , if at all , taxed the gentlest patience ; you stalked the rare and furtive things like wild game , whistling matey calls as you 'd bugle to a moose ; and other hackney hunters shared the kill with a triumphant , " I 'm going Double Bay way , too ? do you mind ? " To give an impartial cross section , I have divided cab fares with an M.P. , American and Australian soldiers , a trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camouflage worker , U. S. marines , and Dutch refugees . Australia Misses Its Tea Counting out tea leaves to ration one ounce a week to a person perpetrated depression dismal as drought . After all , liquidating a national beverage " soaks " many . But the majority coped with the curtailment with humor , and even switched to drinking coffee ! In one shop I stood behind customers three rows deep at the counter . A large sign dryly declared , " Tea completely sold out . " Teathirsty Australians waited patiently for coffee . Patience turned to panic when clothes rationing became imminent . A local impression pictured two shopgirls crouching behind a counter as a mob of material-maddists stormed the already ransacked ramparts . " Wave a white rag , " suggested one of the besieged in desperation . " Oh , no , " said the other . " Someone would buy it ! " Exactly one week after the submarine attack in the harbor , enemy U-boats offshore shelled Sydney at midnight . In man-made setting of thunder and lightning I heard Sydney 's coastal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wardens of London , National Emergency Service personnel jumped to their jobs . The people kept calm as deadly explosives whistled overhead to fall on houses in the suburbs . This was not a case of " practicing again , " and most people knew it without the warning wail of a siren . The enemy shells did slight damage , but they tore open a new chapter in local history . To Sydney Harbour the preceding raid had brought war ; the second onslaught carried the conflict into the very homes . For the first time in its life , Australia 's oldest city was on the receiving end of enemy gunfire . Sydney stood its initial test of tangible , active warfare ; it could take the shelling , and return it , too . More significant than battery barrages , however , boomed the fighting spirit of a sporting people born to healthful pleasure in a natural playground ? but a playground which had worked for the time when it should burst forth a battle station .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
