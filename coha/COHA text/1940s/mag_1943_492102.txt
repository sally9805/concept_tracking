' F ET Eleanor Roosevelt put in a word with her famous husband , suggesting a new idea or slant for some New Deal agency , and likely as not hell pen another note to a certain fellow named Smith : " What 's my policy on this ? " Harold D. Smith doubles for the President in vital Government action nearly every day in the week , but is as little known as a Hollywood star 's stand-in . He is the leading paradox of wartime Washington . He is never spectacular , but has been the architect of more internal earthquakes than any other official within memory . He is not a politician , but his forte is gently knocking politicians ' heads together and making them like it . His title is Director of the Budget , which means he figuratively breakfasts on billions , yet finance has become the least important part of his job . He never hurries . With a large , scholarly head that thrusts forward almost abnormally between heavy shoulders , he walks , talks and grins slowly , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball of fire . And yet in less than four short , swift years he has risen from nowhere to become the adviser and personal agent , the business manager and efficiency expert , the messenger boy and , when necessary , the muscleman of Franklin D. Roosevelt . Not long ago a bigwig from Kansas City dropped in on Vice-President Wallace . He had something to get across at the White House and it was urgent . He had seen the President , but his proposition was too complex for a snap judgment ; it had to be sifted and analyzed . But the bigwig was worried because he thought the President had given him a brush-off . " He told me to put it up to a fellow named Harold Smith , " complained the visitor . " Who 's he ? " The Vice-President looked up quickly . " Smith ? " he said . " You 're lucky . He 's the most important man in this Administration . " Henry Wallace knew whereof he spoke . As Secretary of Agriculture , he once got into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Treasury Morgenthau . A gentleman farmer , Morgenthau thought the Government 's agricultural policy should be changed . Wallace considered this an unenlightened invasion of his bailiwick . Neither hesitated to say so . The President likes his friends and likes them to like each other . He is disturbed and grieved by squabbles within his official family . Nor does he enjoy stepping in to settle them himself . That job , almost invariably , goes to Harold Smith . In this case , subsequent events would indicate , he told Smith to get Wallace and Morgenthau in a room and not let them out until they had settled their differences . Smith got the two Henrys together , and at the end of several hours they shook hands , though a bit coolly . Smith kept working , the immediate issue dwindled , and now the two Henrys are as good friends as ever , or better . This role of presidential peacemaker is only one of many spots in which he pinch-hits for the President . With Judge Sam Rosenman , he lays out the blueprint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies or n shift in power among administrators . When someone must be tactfully fired or kicked upstairs , when a new man is needed to fill a difficult executive post , Smith often is called in . Since he has no ax to grind , and is valued by the President for his objective , unbiased judgment , public figures whose names are household bywords flock to comparatively unknown Mr. Smith for help in putting across ideas with the " Boss . " Sometimes this works in reverse . So legendary has become Smith 's influence among those really in the know that he sometimes is blamed by Cabinet officers for presidential actions which they do not like , of which he has no advance knowledge . Some time ago , Mr. Roosevelt startled his official family by virtually charging at a press conference that the Government was a refuge for draft dodgers . He did not put it quite that way , but he implied as much , so Congress and the executive departments thought , by specifically forbidding draft deferment for any Government employee unless his individual status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once flew into n high state of excitement . Senators who had had nothing good to say about the President in years heartily agreed with him , and chortled . In the top echelons of Government talk buzzed : What had got into Smith ? Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox wanted to know what the blankety blank he was trying to do ? Did n't he know it was as important to make a gun as to fire it ? Irreplacenble men were quitting Navy arsenals to enlist . Army officers had the same complaint . The Bureau of Standards began to lose highly skilled chemists of long and invaluable experience , who were now rushing to get commisaiona or become buck privates . The War Manpower Commission was in a ferment . A conclave was hurriedly called in the office of Paul V. McNutt . The boys were loaded , not for bear but for Smith . Incredulously , his colleagues heard the budget director say he knew nothing about the order . They later reported that he seemed as disturbed as they . In a Bort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be changed , which be didat the next press conference . Nu one yet has been able to discover who , if anyone , suggested the subject to the President . Only Smith 's own obviously turbulent state of mind absolved him of suspicion . Vice-President Wallace . who has had many opportunities to watch Smith work at close quarters , describes him as a " supremely constructive " public official . His greatest interest , " nays Wallace , " is to create a Government machine capable of handling the great problems of the day smoothly and efficiently He steps aggressively into all sorts of situations , views them from an over-all global standpoint , and tries to weld conflicting viewpoints and pressures into a single intelligent and energetic Government policy . In these days . public agencies inevitably battle each other continuously . Smith sits in as umpire , acting for the President . All sides to every dispute know that he will be utterly fair about it . Everybody has confidence in him . " Smith 's penchant for stepping into situations " from the global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most forceful and aggressive men in the country . But though his friends say of his deliberate , plodding tempo , " Harold has just one speed  --  low gear , " he manages to get quick and cohesive action . When the Army took to the Budget Bureau estimates for equipment expenditures for the fiscal year , Smith insisted that before such mammoth drains on the nation 's manpower and material resources could be approved , certain basic , and incidentally long overdue , decisions had to be made . How large an Army ? If the military demand for 7,500,000 men in the Army and 9,700,000 in all services were approved  --  the figures then asked  --  would there be enough manpower left fur war production and civilian essentials ? What sort of mensuree and how drastic , would have to be taken to channel workers now on nonessential kilts or millions of women not ens-played at nEl into war jobs , so that the vast military power could be built ? How long could military Selective Service and civilian manpower management continue , in entirely separate operations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide-open , unrelated spigots ? The President has ordered the building of enough " flying artillery " for an unprecedented knockout smash of Hitler from the air . Was n't it about time aircraft began getting first priority on all materiels ? How would this affect production of previously favored ships , tanks , ordnance and other items ? Would it leave enough metal to equip that 7,500.000-man Army ? Smith had an answer to each of these questions and a general outline for the ( Continued on Page Se ) ? // ( Continued ( roe , Pogo 251 great issue into which they all merge  --  how to mobilize most effectively for quick victory . He urged unification of manpower control under civilian leadership . He not only helped get aircraft first priority but his staff did an efficiency study of the whole Army Air procurement system so that , among other things , all the bomb hays from now on will fit the bombs . He had his opinions on the proper maximum size of the Army , the handling of materials and related issues in the War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of too-great encroachment of military authority into civilian life , all of which he transmitted to the President . What those opinions were is not so important as the fact that , in great measure , it was Smith who focused attention on what had to be decided . He provided the President with March 27,1943 facts and data to help him make the decisions , and urged action now . Smith would he the last to claim that he or his staff handled any of these problems exclusively . Rut when the Army expense estimates went to Smith . none of these transcendently vital decisions had been made . By the time the budget reached Congress they all had been made . When someone storms the White House with his blood pressure up , Harold holds the ice pack that soothes him , and often he 's holding several at once . But he is neither immune from nor allergic to getting into the family scraps himself when he thinks an issue is sufficiently important . Last March , Smith submitted a crisp , alarming note to the President , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if effective means were not immediately taken to block spiraling wages and prices and to absorb the inflationary gap between money in consumers ' hands and goods available to buy , the national economy was riding hull-bent for an explosion . It came back with a penciled notation : " O , l ( . Work fast . F. D. R. " Smith at once gathered the men on whose economic judgment the President leans in such matters  --  the Unofficial Economic Cabinet . To a series of meetings came Wallace , Morgenthau , Federal Reserve Chairman Marriner Eccles ! , Leon Henderson and Claude Wickard . With a single exception , the group reached quick agreement . The time had come when war sacrifices had to be required of civilians . Uncle Sam had to get tough with all income groups . He had to lower income-tax exemptions or establish a system of compulsory savings , or both , as well as put firm ceilings on wages and all prices , including food prim ! Morgenthau alone dissented . He insisted that compulsory savings were not necessary , that many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was all enthused about his budding War Bond drive , and confident it would absorb enough of the extra dollars . Smith . Eccles and the others raised the roof , but Morgenthau would not agree , and since the President is reluctant to take rough action unless completely convinced it is necessary . Morgenthau was successful in getting most of the program put off . It has since been revived , but as it was put in mothballs for the summer , Smith announced grimly that " this sounds like one of these conferences where everybody applauds objectives and principles and then will go off and do nothing . " Morgenthau did not like this even a little , which did not worry Smith . But since the President does not like to have his boys fight , and especially since one of Smith 's natiomerits is to keep them from fighting , the budget director and the Secretary of the Treasury have buried thehatchet , although every once in a while something sharp seems to be discernible , still slicking out of the ground . One day the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President . " What do you think of moving the Immigration Bureau from the Labor Department to the Justice Department ? " " It ought to be done , " Smith replied . " Can you give me an executive order to that effect by tomorrow noon ? " " Yes , " was all Smith said . He could have had it across West Executive Avenue in five minutes . Such an order had been waiting in his upper-left-hand drawer for weeks . When Harald Meets Harold Many conflicts in Government policy which give the impression of ill-managed confusion in reality spring from conflicting pressures in our social or economic Fabric . One of Smith 's principal headaches is to iron these out as rapidly as possible . Recently , for example , McNutt was transferring farmers off marginal farms to higher-production farms to save manpower and increase food production while the Farm Security Administration was financing them to stay where they were . Wickard , with Smith 's help , is launching a drive to get business as usual off the farms , where subsidized groups still insist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dinner-table products of which we are short . Smith 's dogged insistence on scraping barnacles off the ship of state irrespective of personalities made him target for some of Secretary of Interior Ickes ' choicest epithets . " What in hell do you mean , " once demanded the hot-headed Ickes , " by barging into town on the eight-o'clock train and tearing loose agencies that have been here for a hundred years ? " Smith amazed Ickes by sticking out his jaw with the retort , " If they 've been in one rut for a hundred years . maybe it 's about time to make a change ! " The result : He and Ickes ravenously consume noontime sandwiches together in Ickes ' office regularly every ten days . Michigan Apprenticeship Mr. Smith came to Washington four years ago . In the middle of the second New Deal term , he was in Ann Arbor , Michigan , doubling in brass is a college professor and professional government uplifter  --  from the outside . His first and only plunge into politics had been his elec-tion. as a Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1936 . Of course , Smith was no ordinary county supervisor . For ten years he had been director of the Michigan Municipal League . writing city charters . imprnving municipal buying systems , pitching in on the pro-public side before a gerry-mandered legislature , building a na-tional name in his chosen profes-sion , the science of government . In that period . Smith became director of the Bureau of Government at the University of Michigan . chair-man of Republi-can Governor Fitzgerald 's Wel-fare Study Com-mission , consult-ant for several national organizn-tiona , president of the American Municipal Associ- ! diem and twice a representative of theAmericanGov-ernment in Eu-rope to study in-ternational mu-nicipal problems . When Democrat Frank Murphy , later President Roosevelt 's Attorney General and now emaciate justice of the Supreme Court , became governor of Michigan on January 1 , 1937 , he invited : smith to he his budget director . But with his career staked out in the reform field , Smith said " No " ? twice . On the third occasion the silver-tongued Murphy really went to work on his balky friend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded , did he expect to accomplish more by standing outside and arguing about it . or getting inside and doing it ? Murphy wanted Smith to revisie and modernize the budgeting and accounting system of Michigan . Three official statements of the state 's financial position came out each year  --  from the state treasurer , the state auditor , the administrative board . Occasionally they agreed . " He gave me something I could bite into , " Smith explains , " and I took it . " Smith was born on n Farm near Haven , Kaman* , in 1898 . Both of his grandfathers fought in the Civil War on the Northern side . His father 's parents were Scotch and Irish , whose forebears went to Indiana from Virginia , where , in prerevolutionary days , they had migrated from North Carolina . The Pennsylvania Dutch of his mother 's side also traces back to the Revolution and beyond . Harold 's parents , James William Smith and Miranda Elating , met in Indiana and migrated to Kansas . He was the oldest of five , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work . As a boy he got up before five in harvest season to renew the fire in the old-fashioned wood-burning threshing machine which served all the farmers in the district . Harold was its chauffeur and mechanic . Harold 's upbringing was strict and religious . At the University of Kansas , he became president of the college Y. M.C.A . and planned to go to China as a scientific missionary . But in his senior year Smith was the prize student of Charles M. Fassett , former mayor of Spokane , Washington , then teaching government at Kansas . An inspiring leader of youth , Fassett convinced the earnest young man that he could accomplish more by devoting his missionary ambitions to attacking the incompetency and crookedness which pervade so many segments of our political system . Attending with Fassett a Kansas City meeting of the international city-manager movement , then a rallying point for the enemies of entrenched machines , Smith met Prof. Thomas H. Reed , who WAS starting a course in municipal administration at the University of Michigan . He offered an assistantship at $900 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours of class ... work , and a masterof-arts degree in public administration . Smith grabbed it . But hack in Kansas there was unfinished business  --  especially his former classmate , tall , dark and strikingly pretty Lillian Mayer . And besides , to repay his father for financial help at college , he wanted to build him a home in Lawrence . " I think I fell in love with Harold , " recalls Mrs. Smith . now the energetic mother of four . and a top-flight golfer , " while he was hanging by his knees from a rafter . I was working et the college at Lawrence , and every day I walked by the house he was building . That really was an admirable thing to do for his family , and not many men could have done it He drew the plans , laid the drainage and foundations , put in the plumbing , wiring and everything else , including the roof , with his brothers ' help . Well , as I passed , he was usually in some funny position that made me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He really has a wonderful voice . You know , one of his suppressed desires has always been to be a grand-opera singer . " This latter revelation Mr. Smith denies as a canard , but he admits falling speedily in love with Miss Mayer and bringing her hack from a trip to California in 1926 as Mrs. Smith . The Road to Washington has pre.ohnbly built more things with his hands and has greater mechanical aptitude and experience today than a majority of the nation 's industrial executives . He is not only n competent carpenter but a first-class plumber , n cobbler and an electrician . He still cuts the hair of his fourteen-year-old-son . Lawrence , and in the hasement of his home in Arlington , Virginia , lie has built more than half of the family tables , bookcases and porch furniture . His Arlington home Smith originally rented because it was convenient fur Lillian , right across the street from the first fairway of the Washington Golf and Country Club . He soon found it had been a headache to the owners . Nobody could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor the plumbing . So Smith bought the house for a bargain , fixed the heating , plumbing and wiring himself , built on new back porch and has already refused much more than he paid for it . That is typical . If he can find a twenty-two-dollar suit that looks like eighty-five dollars , he 's proud of it . Once , long before rationing , he took off a shoe and said , " What do you think I paid for that ? " It looked like about eight-fifty or ten dollars . " Noise , " said he . " Ran into a sale . A dollar ninety-five . I bought all they had  --  four pairs . " Back in 1918 , when Mr. Roosevelt was Assistant Secretary of the Navy , he outlined to the Naval Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives his ideas about the proper functions of a budget bureau . Those ideas have never changed . That was hack in the days before there was any executive budget at all  --  when every department got its own stack of chips from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little more to say about who got what than the city clerk of Pocatello , Idaho . Idealistic young career politician Roosevelt told the startled congressmen that a budget bureau should have complete control over compiling and supervising Government expenditures and that the top man in such an outfit should he no politician but a professional administrator . In his first seven years in the White House , Mr. Roosevelt did not get around to carrying this idea through . The administration of soundly conceived reforms suffered as a result . The Budget Bureau , since its formation in 1921 , had had the hybrid status of being in but not of the Treasury . It reported through the Secretary , but was responsible to the President alone . With his first budget director , Lewis W. Douglas , Mr. Roosevelt had one of his few open breaches , since healed . His second director was Daniel W. Bell , a fine civil servant , who preferred to be Under Secretary of the Treasury . By 1939. the President would wait no longer for his long-overdue personal staff . He ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specifications . The list came hack with Smith 's name ranked at least 50 per cent higher than any other . Bell called him to Washington without saying why . " So you 're the Smith I 've been hearing about , " was the President 's hearty greeting when Bell took him in . " Now that I see you , you pass muster . " Bell told the President that Smith was reluctant to take the job , having too many bridges to burn in Michigan . The President picked up a packet of matches and handed them to Smith . " Start burning your bridges , " he said . When they got outside , Smith asked , " Did he offer me a job ? " " Sure , " said Bell . When Smith took over the Budget Bureau , its total appropriation was $187,000 , which included some $40.000 for printing the document . That meant the bureau could do little more than add up estimates submitted by departments , and try , by hostile or seductive cross-examination , to force them into a confession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the futile hope that if the Budget Bureau kept its expenses at a starvation level , so would everyone else . The Watch on the Potomac Smith 's not large enough but extremely efficient staff today plunges into estimates , not on the old irate-prosecutor basis but in an atmosphere of mutual search for the answer to : Aqua will balance the human budget of the United States ? The five branches of the bureau have spread far beyond fiscal estimates into a sweeping breadth of function . With no defensive interest in any agency , they prepare for the President staff reports on any issue . They propose new policies and draft , analyze and criticize all aorta of programs . Every bill passed by Congress goes to the Budget Bureau for study and a report to the President recommending approval or veto , and why . All legislation going to Congress from the executive arm must first clear the Budget Bureau , so individual bureaucrats , including Cabinet members , can no longer run to Congress asking for taws in conflict with the President 's policies . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Executive Reorganization Act and continuing through NDAC , OPM , OPALS , OPA , OEM , SPAB , WPB , WLB , OES , WMC and the rest , the spadework was done in the Budget Bureau , with Smith and Rosenman usually getting together on 1Conlinucct on Page . 581 // ( Continued from Popo 56 ) the final executive order that went to F.D.R. As it studies departmental estimates , the bureau is constantly getting ideas for cutting red tape , combining , expanding or contracting agencies , or moving them out of war-swollen Washington . ? Meanwhile , Smith is throwing his weight on labor policy , military policy , industrial , fiscal and economic policy , handling Washington 's delicate distinctions and touchy , jealous , powerful prima donnas with confident realism and a dry sense of humor . A member of the last Congress , having in mind that American life was increasingly controlled by executive orders , half seriously puts it , " We grant the power and Harold Smith writes the laws . " But Smith himself , sitting literally at the nerve center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the iConlinuod from Poge 3 ) moneybags and the other on the President 's knee  --  the living answer to the question : " What sort of men really pull the strings in Washington ? " ? is principally impressed by his success as a scientist , rather than his status as Mr. Roosevelt 's Mr. Fix-it . " We consider the budget as an integrated social and fiscal program , " he says . " We go into the economic interreiativities of various proposals . We serve as an agent of the President in coordinating operations . No budget office , if it is worth a damn , can run counter to the social forces of a democracy . In peace or war , management lies at the core of democratic government . " Smith leans forward earnestly and adds , " I 've never thought I was very smart , but I do think I can make a contribution . We are trying to implement good government and stifle bad . This is my contribution . "             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
