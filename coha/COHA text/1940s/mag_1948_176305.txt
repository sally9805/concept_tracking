In sunny New South Wales , as in Southern California , it is near-perfect tennis weather all year long . Oswald William Thomas Sidwell liked to play tennis as much as the next youngster , but figured that his real sporting future lay on a golf course . Then the war gave Billy Sidwell a chance to play tennis against G.I.s in Britain . He did so well that he decided to stick to the game . Last week all Australia had reason to be thankful . <P> At Longwood Cricket Club in Chestnut Hill , Mass. , Australia was matched with Czechoslovakia in the Davis Cup interzone finals . After 27 countries had been eliminated , the survivors were fighting for the right to challenge the U.S. ( last year 's winner ) next fortnight . Missing were the top 1947 Australian Davis Cuppers : Dinny Pails had turned pro , and John Bromwich ( who hates airplanes ) had refused to fly to the U.S. Australia was counting on overage ( 35 ) Captain Adrian " Quist , the national singles champion . <P> Dogged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cernik , with little trouble , 6-2 , 13-11 , 6-0 . Then wiry little Billy Sidwell , 28 , went up against Jaroslav Drobny , 27 , Europe 's best . Billy 's backhand was in perfect control , and he tantalized the left-handed Czech with frequent line placements on his left side . Between sets , Sidwell sat down to catch his breath , keeping Drobny waiting , and picked himself up with great deliberation whenever he slipped on the dewy grass . Uncharitable spectators figured that the Australian was just grandstanding ; but insiders knew that Sidwell had to take things easy after a nervous collapse from overtraining early this year . Only a hundred spectators were still-around when Sidwell won , 6-3 , 6-2 , 9-11 , 14-12 . <P> The Czechs , now behind 2-0 , came back to win the doubles . Playing his second singles , against Jaroslav Drobny , Adrian Quist had a chance to clinch the matches . But age told : he got off to a good start , only to lose , 6-8 , 3-6 , 18-16 , 6-3 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands of Billy Sidwell . He polished off Czech Cernik in straight sets , 7-5 , 6-4 , 6-2 . That spelled victory for Australia , 3-2 . <P> Who would represent the U.S. in the Davis Cup matches ? Now that Jake Kramer had turned pro , the first rank of U.S. amateur tennis was a pretty lackluster lot . At Newport , R.I. , last week , in the Casino Invitation tournament , the old familiar faces went through their old familiar paces in a last unofficial singles warmup before Forest Hills . This week the Davis Cup committee , to nobody 's surprise , picked Veterans Ted Schroeder , Gardnar Mulloy , Frank Parker and Billy Talbert to represent the U.S. against Australia . But the real news at Newport was made by youngsters whom the committee did not consider ripe enough for the team . <P> Philadelphia 's fast , rangy , young ( 24 ) Victor Seixas ( rhymes with gracious ) , a University of North Carolina senior with a cannonball service and a neat drop shot , upset top-seeded Schroeder in the quarterfinals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing in the semifinals . It was the second tournament defeat in a row for Schroeder , who just was n't in shape .
