" Due to crowded conditions and in the interests of safety , " President Wyatte Dawson Guthrie of Long Island 's Roosevelt Field fortnight ago ordered no more flying there in training planes weighing less than 1,500 pounds . His order provoked a crisis in four flying schools which were training 135 college boys and girls as part of the Civil Aeronautics Board 's nationwide pilot-training program for U. S. youth . Safair Inc. promptly grabbed National Airport at nearby Hicksville for its 60 students . The other three schools pooled their resources , graded , reconditioned , and in record time christened the East Meadow Auxiliary Field .

S. <P> By last week the CAB program , adopted by 435 universities and colleges from Harvard to Hawaii , had become one of the biggest Government-subsidized enterprises in the history of U.

Flight instruction is farmed out to some 700 private flying schools , to which CAB pays $325 a student for the elementary course . Most schools use tan dem training planes with a cruising speed of 70 m.p.h. , but the Stanford unit is experimenting with a spin-proof plane equipped with tricycle landing gear and other safety features . Its first year completed with only one fatality , CAB was rewarded by a 30% reduction in premiums on the insurance it now carries for every student ( $3,000 life , $500 hospitalization ) . <P> CAB airmen are chosen from students ( and a few nonstudents ) aged 18 to 26 . Girls are limited to 3% of each class .
