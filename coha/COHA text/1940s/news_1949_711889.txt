txt A lot of manufacturers of trailers  --  the kind you can reside in  --  are wondering what sideswiped them . They were rolling along high-production highways , thinking how far they had come in so short a time , when suddenly they found themselves off the pavement If you 'll wait while a few repairs are made , they say . you may see them humping along again . Last year 's pace was something trailer men are proud of . They turned out a record 85,000 homes on wheels , more than double their yearly pre-war production . Even more impressive , their output was about three times that of the prefabricators , whose houses wo n't budge after moving from factory to foundation . Indeed , trailer statisticians figure their industry 's production was a tenth as large as the-number of all non-migratory homes built to sell for less than $10.000 . About nine out of ten coaches are used for year-around hying , nowadays , and " low price is the big reason , " according to Harold D. Platt- He runs the Platt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Trailer Coach Manufacturers Association which is holding its thirteenth annual show here . Says he : " Trailers cost less than half as much as any other form of housing . The average delivered price of those sold last year was 63,000 ? including furniture and such major appliances as ranges and refrigerators . " The New Slackness Prices this year run about 10% lower than last , and firms that have n't cut prices have mostly added extra equipment , such as air conditioning units , at no increase . Bragging about their " bargains , " trailer makers are somewhat baffled by the new slackness in demand . La Salle Coach Co. , also of Elkhart , says its output has been cut back to " below normal " even for this slow season of the year . Raymond Products Co. of Saginaw , Mich.t reports that at the end of 1946 it was making nine Travelo trailers a day ; since then it has cut back to three a day . E. H.

Bartholomew says his Indian Trailer Corp. , Chicago , one of the oldest firms in the business , has been operating at only 25% of capacity ever since November 1 . While November is the start of the slow season and model changeover time , he declares that 60% of capacity now would be more nearly normaL The industry has its optimists . They Include some of the larger companies such as MidStates Trailqr Corp. , of Chicago , which sold 2,600 trailers last year and has plans for making 3,600 this year , and even a few of the smaller ones like Pacemaker Trailer Co. of glIchart . Ind. , which asserts it will step up output to four a day from two daily . But most in the industry agree that vigorous action will be required to remedy their dip in sales . The Repair Program And vigorous action is what they have in mind . Besides cutting prices , they are teaching their dealers how to sell , backing them up with a sizable ad campaign , improving their products and adding innovations , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thousand dealers showed up at this-year 's show  --  twice as many as last year . They were drilled at a sales clinic . which pounded such themes as the proper approach to customers , display arrangement , and advertising . The salesmen got good advice from experts of such firms as General Motors . They were exposed to reels of movies on selling methods . Helping to maintain the 1949 market for trailers will be the industry association 's ad budget of $200,000 , up 14% from last year and double the 1946 fund . It will promote trailer living and park ownership through space in national mass-circulation magazines and trade publications . The fund comes from dues paid by 57 member manufacturers , based on volume of production . Getting enough good parking sites for trailers is vital to the industry , the manufacturers believe . At present there are only about 8,000 " parks " where a family can roll its home into a lot , hook up to public utilities and settle down . More are needed , the Industry believes , and many existing ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some 4,000 parks and found just 2,200 worthy of certificates of approval . Such a certificate rewards adequate sanitary , laundry , recreation and electrical facilities , proper appearance and size . During 1949 the association will inspect many more parks and continue to recommend changes . A Diplomatic Corps It wIll.also try to interest private capital in creation of new parks ? " as important to us as hard roads were to the auto industry . " The association offers a counseling service , free blueprints for layouts of buildings , lots and sanitation facilities . And it offers the services of a diplomatic corps to convince doubtful communities they should accept the burdens these parks impose on schools , sewers and other services . Officials cite Springfield . Mass. , as a city at first reluctant to permit a trailer park ; T.C.M.A. and local trailer dealers got together with town officials , showed their plans , and won their Case .

There are also connections for phone and electricity . these are metered and billed jo the occupant just as in an ordinary house . Trailer stoves use " bottled " gas This park has a recreation area and boasts it is the first trailer community in the nation to be granted door-todoor mail service . Are They Here in Sta3 Some builders of traditional-type dwellings think the heyday of trailers is over- - that the only reason so Many people ( over a million ) have been living in them in recent years is that they could n't find any other roof to put over their heads .
