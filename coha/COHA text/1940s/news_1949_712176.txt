txt Sir Stafford Cripps , Chancellor of the Exchequer and Britain 's economic chief , confirmed to the House of Commons yesterday reports that there had been a serious drain on the gold and dollar reserves of the so-called " sterling area " during the second quarter of 1949 . This is the group of countries , inside and outside the British Commonwealth , which is loosely associated by a homogeneous exchange policy and of which Britain is the leading member and central banker . These countries pool their gold and dollars in London , and they have long considered $2,000 , - 000,000 to be the minimum for such reserves consistent with a state of assured and continuing solvency . At $1,884,000,000 , the figure was well below that level as far back as the end of March . Since then , it now appears , the members have taken out $260,000 , - 000 more than they have put in , with the result that the reserve now stands at $1,624,000,000 . This fall in the dollar holdings of Britain and her neighbors in the sterling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which much has been heard in recent weeks . Whether the term crisis is justified is , perhaps , a matter of opinion . Certainly Britain is confronted with a serious problem . But , as Sir Stafford observed yesterday , any comparison with the " convertibility crisis " of July and August , 1947 , would be entirely misleading . British production today , he pointed out , " is at a record level in the whole of our history , " and her exports are " as high as they have ever been , and half again as high as in mid-1947 . " The specific problem reflected in the decline of dollar holdings , as the Chancellor of the Exchequer told the Commons , is that of adjusting Britain 's economic program to meet the new requirements of a seller 's market throughout the world , and particularly in the dollar area . So long as the world was suffering from a general war-created shortage of goods , and so long as the post-war inflationary boom prevailed in the United States , there was an almost unlimited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy dictated was one of all-out production , without too much thought of whether costs and prices were or were not excessive . That post-war phase , however , is now a thing of the past . The present world situation places a premium , so far as Britain is concerned , not merely on production , but on efficient production ? production which will enable that country to win and hold export markets on the basis of price , quality and service , especially in the dollar area , where it has a chronic deficit . Sir Stafford has no illusions about all this . " We must , " says he , " get our export prices down to a point which enables us to improve our position in these markets , and the rather easy methods resulting from the unlimited demand of the last ten years must go . " As far back as mid-June , the Chancellor revealed yesterday , the Government had twisted tighter the tourniquet that it had already applied to prevent the drain of dollars . Instructions had gone out to all purchasing departments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the maximum extent practicable . " Existing contracts and commitments will remain in force , but specific authority will be required for any new dollar purchases , " and will be given only when a clear case of na ' =nai necessity has been established . " But Sir Stafford does not regard this order as in any sense a " solution " of Britain 's difficulties , however essential it may be as a stop-gap measure . While this " stand-still " arrangement is in force , he told the Commons , " the Government will press on with every practicable method of increasing our export trade ; above all , the sales of goods and services for dollars . " This newest development with re- spect to Britain 's world trade position is certain to mean a renewal of the demand in some quarters for the devaluation of sterling . That expectation was anticipated by the Chancellor in yesterday 's address . " British Treasury officials , " he told his listeners , " have not the slightest intention of devaluing the pound . " Whatever may be said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in general , and sterling in particular , Sir Stafford , it seems to us , is thoroughly consistent in rejecting it as a panacea for Britain 's present ills . Indeed , the case for it even as a supplementary policy is very dubious . Those who argue for reducing the parity of the pound contend that this would stimulate British exports to the dollar area and thus produce additional dollars with which to rebuild the sterling area 's reserves . That would be the case only if it resulted in an increase in purchases more than sufficient to counterbalance the reduction in sterling . There is no magic in devaluation , even on the export side , for devaluation is essentially a disguised subsidy which tends to impoverish th , country which engages in it . So far as Britain is concerned , moreover , it would operate to deflect attention from and lessen the demand for action on the real problem , which is that of more efficient production . But what of the import side ? Britain purchased more than twice as much from the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importing three times as much . Devaluation would , of course , raise the cost of her heavy imports , and through them her cost of living at a time when the country is committed in every aspect of its program to planned disinflation . One may argue that disinflation is unsound ( though devaluationists rarely do ) , but one can hardly argue for a policy that is half disinflation and half inflation .
