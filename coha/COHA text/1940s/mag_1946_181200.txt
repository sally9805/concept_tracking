How did Hermann Goring kill himself ? How did he manage , in the midst of defeat and humiliation , to become a hero and thus virtually to destroy the positive psychological effect of the Nrnberg trial ? From Nrnberg , TIME Correspondent John Stanton cabled : <P> It happened because the Army had placed in charge of the prison a pompous , unimaginative , and thoroughly likable officer who was n't up to his job . Colonel Burton C. Andrus loved that job . Every morning his plump little figure , looking like an inflated pouter pigeon , moved majestically into the court , impeccably garbed in his uniform and highly shellacked helmet . His bow to the judges as they entered was one of the sights of Nrnberg . He loved to pen little notes : " The American Colonel invites the distinguished French prosecutor and his staff to accompany him to a baseball game . " <P> He had spent long hours with his staff planning every last detail of the prisoners ' life . He arranged anti-suicide cells in which even the tables were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posted 24-hour guards before each cell and insisted that the prisoners sleep with hands outside the blankets . He required prisoners to take exercise periods during which their cells were searched . He had designed interview booths in which prisoners and visitors could converse with one another without being able to touch hands . All seemed well , but Andrus forgot that a pattern had been set , and with men like Gring , just to see the pattern was to see ways to break it . <P> Blossoming Theories . Security became a joke . One man pasted a dog 's picture ever his own and went in &; out of the courthouse for days . On sentencing day itself a woman reporter moved by all the guards and reached the courtroom , to discover that she had forgotten to take a .38 caliber revolver out of her handbag . She could have leaned over and shot Gring - or the Chief Justice . But Colonel Andrus puttered about , occasionally stealing a dentist 's tool from the prison dentist 's office , just to see if it would be missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , elaborate theories blossomed . Samples : the poison capsule was hidden in his pipe stem , in a small abdominal incision , in a tooth , in the binding of a book . Dizziest theory of the lot was that Gring faked the gurgling sounds of pain which first attracted the guard to his cell ; thereupon the guard summoneJ the doctor , who then administered the poison . <P> But elaborate schemes were not necessary . The number of people who had opportunity to give poison to Gring were legion . There were German doctors , cooks and laundry workers . While working in the prison they were forbidden to go outside , but they had contact with people from outside . Then there was the courtroom itself : during recesses throngs of people milled about the dock and papers were passed back &; forth . Not since the day Gring entered Nrnberg prison was he forced to submit to a rectal examination . Other parts of his body ( his ears , for instance ) went unexamined .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
