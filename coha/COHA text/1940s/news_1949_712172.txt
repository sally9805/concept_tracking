txt Many hoped the cramped quarters would shorten debate on the treaty , whose ratification by a two-thirds vote is assured . It is pointed out that there is practically nothing new to he said on this issue after months of preliminary debate . Neither of these reasons . however . necessarily limits Senate speeches . In the background of the present situation , as Senator Tom Connally ( D ) of Texas , chairman of the ' Senate Foreign Relations Committee , presented his unanimous , bipartisan committee endorsement of the pact , is the whole difficult world situation . Senators did not really debate the Atlantic Treaty so much as peripheral issues , These include : 1 . How far is the United States morally bound under the treaty if one of the Atlantic nations is attacked ? 2 . Does treaty ratification imply approval of the military-aid program which the administration is preparing to submit ? 3 . How much Marshall Plan aid shall the United States send ? 4 . What steps should the United States take toward the deepening European dollar shortage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look The foregoing are really the subjects of discussion as the pact debate begins , The treaty is the vehicle for a new look at America 's whole international position . Senate debate could hardly have started under less auspicious physical circumstances . " The North Atlantic Treaty . " said Senator Connally. , " is a flaming sign to any aggressor , to any nation that contemplates armed attack upon a peaceful and law . abiding nation ? ' Do not enter ' the North Atlantic area . " The pact and the arms export program , he declared , are not " Siamese twins . " He gave a " categoric no " to charges that the treaty involves an automatic war commitment . On the other hand he solemnly warned the country not to " avoid cold reality by searching for escape clauses . " Historic Senate Senator Connally with his hair worn long in back and his senatorial attire seemed to fit into the historic old chamber that once held the Senate . It was here that legislators wrangled over the Monroe Doctrine . Senator Connally looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debate . Washington 's summer jungle heat has settled in . The new room where the Senate finds itself is too small in most respects , ( Absence of spectators ' galleries . on the other hand , might be conducive to shorter speeches . ) The legislative situation is jammed . From time to time the treaty debate will be temporarily interrupted to consider some overdue appropriation bill . Finally . senators . like everybody else in the capital . want to get away for a vacation . Meanwhile , business recession at home makes Congress more prepared to count the pennies of foreign aid and defense . This situation , however , does not reduce the importance of the great decisions which Congress must make , Basically , this comes down to a problem of how fa ? the United States is prepared to go in continuing postwar help abroad complicated by the problem of Russia 's intransigeance . Rarely have greater world problems come before a Congress more disposed to hurry through and get home . War Scare Ebbs The whole matter of relations with Russia is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears to be subsiding as it is increasingly felt that the Soviets are in no mood or condition for a war at present . This " scare " was always largely psychological , it is felt , but its influence on foreign legislation was crucial . Again and again it helped get through Truman aid programs . To the degree that there has been a slackening of tension it may be more difficult to enact current bills affecting world affairs . Congress failed to reenact the reciprocal trade agreement program which officially expired July 1 . The administration will bring it up for renewal when the pact is out of the way , it is expected . Republicans Nvill resist it as they generally have in the past . This will further complicate legislative matters . Expenses Tallied Europeans Nvill watch the Atlantic Pact discussion closely , not so much to find out the result , which is discounted , but to catch . the latest mood of America . Above all , they want to see if there has been a slackening of America 's postwar internationalism and retreat into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has been a prevailing American mood on occasion in times past . The big cost of overseas aid is bound to he emphasized . One estimate puts such costs $t 57,250.000.000 in the fiscal year just closed . This included Marshall Plan aid . ** relief in Germany and Japan , $1,200,000,000 ; aid to China , 5850 , - 000,000 : Greek-Turkish aid . 5300 , - 000,000 : other countries , $200,000. - 000 : the balance went for administering the foreign-aid programs and membership in various world groups . Before Senator Connally opened the pact debate a number of opponents had fired last-minute blasts . In a letter sent to all Senators Henry A. Wallace denounced the treaty and charged that " economic blockades " with eastern Europe are costing many jobs . Lift such blockades . Mr. Wallace said , and there will be " a million more jobs in America within six months . " Pact Held Dangerous He continued : " But if we persist in imposing economic blockades , if we persist in adding the military and political barrier of the pact to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million less jobs in this country within the next six months . " Senator George W. Malone ( R ) of Nevada , also declared opposition to the pact . He said : " The pact is dangerous . Under it we no longer will be the sole judge of whether our peace and safety is threatened . That independent decision will be taken from us . " Informal polls indicate not more ? than a dozen or so senators opposing the treaty .
