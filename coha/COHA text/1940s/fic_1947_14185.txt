SCENE : At Mrs. TOWER 'S , Hyde Park Gate , London . A hall-like living room with French windows at the right leading into a lovely English garden . Mrs. TOWER is constantly redecorating her house ; she lets off steam by doing it . At the moment the left wall is made entirely of antique glass in panels . When MRS . TOWER looks at the wall , as she frequently does to fix her face or touch up her hair , she gets a wavering , merciful , Melissandish reflection . For the rest , the room is furnished with gaiety and charm . There are flowers everywhere , and in one corner and elaborate bird cage containing MRS . TOWER 'S canaries , which she feeds intermittently when she has nothing better to do . TIME : September , 1937 . AT RISE : ANN TOWER , a lovely young girl , comes in with PETER CREWE . PETER is twenty-three , negligently dressed , with a sensitive , scholastic face , a humorous mouth , and keen eyes . As soon as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TOWER ( A little breathless ) I hope my father has n't arrived yet . PETER CREWE Are you very anxious to see him ? ANN TOWER To tell you the truth , Peter , I 've always been rather a little scared of him . But he is my father and I have n't seen him in two years . ( WILSON comes in ) Oh , Wilson , has Mr. Tower been here ? p. 3 WILSON Not yet , Miss . ANN TOWER ( Very much relieved ) Oh , good ! Is Mother home ? WILSON She 's out , I believe , Miss Ann . ANN TOWER Thank you , Wilson . WILSON Tea , Miss ? ANN TOWER No , thank you , Wilson . Mr. Crewe would prefer a whiskey and soda , I believe . I 'll get him one . WILSON Very good , Miss . ( He goes out . ) ANN TOWER ( Pouring drink ) Well , you have n't said anything about Father 's play yet . Did n't you like it ? PETER CREWE Though the program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a period piece . Beautifully written though  --  a perfectly articulated fossil . ( She looks hurt ) Forgive me , darling . ANN TOWER Peter , I 'm going to say something very brazen to you . If you were n't already married  --  would you marry me ? PETER CREWE ( With humorous tenderness ) No , I do n't think so . ANN TOWER Why not ? p. 4 PETER CREWE I do n't think it would be a very sensible thing for you to do . ANN TOWER I do n't want a sensible marriage . I want a love marriage . PETER CREWE We have love now . Why not let well enough alone ? ANN TOWER I feel so frustrated . I ca n't even enjoy the luxury of hating your wife . I feel so sorry for her . Where is she now , do you suppose ? PETER CREWE Hard to say . When I last heard from her she was in Vienna . Maybe she 's there . Maybe she 's in a concentration camp somewhere . I ca n't find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful of you to marry her  --  just to give her a passport . PETER CREWE Unfortunately it did n't work . ( A moment . ) ANN TOWER ( Sighs wistfully ) I wish you 'd marry me  --  to give me a passport  --  a passport to happiness . ( This makes him smile ) Why do you always laugh at me ? PETER CREWE It 's that phrase  --  it makes me laugh . It has the charm of the long since bygone . ANN TOWER Do n't you believe in happiness ? p. 5 PETER CREWE Oh , darling Even if I did n't believe it , you would have proved to me that it still is possible . ANN TOWER Peter , I love you . PETER CREWE I love you , too . ( She kisses him ) Your mother ca n't bear me . ( He chuckles . ) ANN TOWER But I can . PETER CREWE Although you 'd never know it the way your mother and her friends go on , we 're sitting on top of a cauldron . Any moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we 're all going down the drain . As soon as it happens I shall enlist . And you talk about happiness that lasts forever ! ANN TOWER I 'll never marry anyone else . I 've told Mother that . PETER CREWE From her point of view , you know ANN TOWER Well ? PETER CREWE Your mother 's a very silly woman , but from her point of view I can perfectly understand her antagonism to me . I 'm a semi-employed journalist with an uncontrollable passion for writing poetry . Terrible secret vice ! ANN TOWER One day it will become public . p. 6 PETER CREWE Well , I ca n't accuse you of being pessimistic , anyhow . ANN TOWER ( A little helpless ) Oh , dear ! PETER CREWE ( Rallying her ) You know , Ann , sometimes I 'm tempted to tell your mother I 'm married  --  just to see the effect on her . ANN TOWER ( Alarmed ) Oh , please do n't do that , please ! It would give her too much satisfaction ! It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ann , through the underground of the unemployed in Fleet Street I heard of a job in Manchester . ANN TOWER Manchester is so gloomy ! ( Desperately ) There must be something here in London  --  there must . You write so brilliantly ! PETER CREWE ( Dryly ) I quite agree with you , but you and I are the only ones who seem to know it . ANN TOWER ( Suddenly struck with a wonderful idea ) Peter  --  I say ! PETER CREWE What ? ANN TOWER Lord Frobisher ! Why not get a job with Lord Frobisher ? p. 7 PETER CREWE What as ? Valet ? ANN TOWER No . On one of his papers . He is a great friend of Mother 's . In fact PETER CREWE What ? ANN TOWER It is popularly supposed that he broke up Mother 's marriage . He owes Mother something , would n't you say ? The least he could do in return is to give you a job . PETER CREWE But , darling , he 's on the wrong side of everything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . PETER CREWE He 's done awfully well being on the wrong side . I 'm afraid not . ANN TOWER Well , I 'm going to try . I wo n't hear of your burying yourself in Manchester . If you do  --  I warn you  --  I 'll follow you ! PETER CREWE That would make Manchester far less gloomy ! WILSON ( Comes in and announces ) Mr. Tower . ( WILLIAM TOWER walks in . The actor who plays WILLIAM TOWER will do well to study the portraits and read the works of W. Somerset Maugham . It will be particularly helpful to him to read The Summing Up by this writer . TOWER wears a monocle on a broad black ribbon with which he habitually fixes people. ) p. 8 ANN TOWER ( Rushes to her father ) Dad ! WILLIAM TOWER Hello , Ann darling . It 's lovely to see you again . ( They embrace . ) ANN TOWER This is Peter Crewe , a great friend of mine . WILLIAM TOWER How do you do ? PETER CREWE How do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and a poet . WILLIAM TOWER Fascinating combination . Hovering between fact and fancy . PETER CREWE Sometimes the poetry is the fact , sir , and the journalism is the fancy . WILLIAM TOWER I suspect that when I read the London papers  --  especially Lord Frobisher 's . ANN TOWER Well , Dad , you 're looking grand . How 's Africa ? WILLIAM TOWER Enormous ! ( There is an awkward pause , which TOWER does nothing to mitigate ) ANN TOWER ( A little desperately ) Peter was saying the other day how much he envied you . WILLIAM TOWER ( With no flicker of interest ) Really ? Why ? p. 9 PETER CREWE ( To help ANN out ) Er  --  your knack for lucrative travel . I mean to say , office in your head . You want to go to San Francisco  --  you go to San-Francisco . Impulse toward Siam  --  you go to Siam . And where-ever you go , you write your stuff and the editors gobble it up . Ideal life  --  really  --  ( As he gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes  --  well , Ann , I 'm sure your father wants to be left alone with you . WILLIAM TOWER ( Corroborating ) I have n't seen Ann for a couple of years , you know . ANN TOWER Peter is coming back in any case to take me to dinner . ( To TOWER ) Perhaps you 'll join us . WILLIAM TOWER Thank you very much . I 'm dining out . But perhaps we can lunch tomorrow ? ANN TOWER Lovely ! Good-bye , Peter darling . See you in a minute . PETER CREWE Good-bye , Mr. Tower . WILLIAM TOWER ( Has already dismissed him ) Good-bye . ( PETER is amused at TOWER 'S willingness to be rid of him . He expects it and understands it . He goes out , blowing a kiss to ANN , which she returns , behind TOWER 'S back ) Well , Ann ! p. 10 ANN TOWER You were n't very cordial to my young man . WILLIAM TOWER Oh , is he your young man ? ANN TOWER He is indeed ! WILLIAM TOWER Journalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a profession at all . It 's a luxury . Can Mr. Crewe afford it ? ANN TOWER Have n't changed a bit , have you , darling ? WILLIAM TOWER Thank you . Or perhaps you did n't mean it as a compliment . ANN TOWER You know , you do have a knack for diminishing people ! You 're supposed to be heartless , cynical . WILLIAM TOWER ( Very kindly ) Your mother always used that word to describe me without in the least understanding its original meaning . It 's fashionable to confuse skepticism with cynicism . Now , Ann dear , do n't take on your mother 's patter . Develop your own . It 'll be equally shallow , but at least it wo n't be borrowed . But tell me , has n't your mother altered all the furniture ? ANN TOWER Oh , you have n't seen this , have you ? Everything that Mother could pickle , she pickled ; and what she could n't pickle , she painted . WILLIAM TOWER ( As he takes in the room ) Everything harmonizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; after a moment ) How long will you be in London ? WILLIAM TOWER About a month , I expect . ANN TOWER Where do you go then ? WILLIAM TOWER India . ANN TOWER Is n't it funny , Dad ? I admire you enormously and I 'm very fond of you and proud too and yet WILLIAM TOWER Yes ? ANN TOWER I 'm shy with you . WILLIAM TOWER Well , when it comes to that , perhaps I am with you . ANN TOWER I 'm sure you are . I feel I do n't know you at all . Your writings are lucid but you personally , you 're somewhat WILLIAM TOWER ( Helps her out ) Opaque ? ANN TOWER Yes . That 's it ! You know , I often wonder why you do n't marry again . Is there any one on the horizon ? WILLIAM TOWER Even if there were I should n't marry it . ANN TOWER Why not ? WILLIAM TOWER One reason is I ca n't afford to marry again because your mother gets most of my income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhappy with her to give up so much . WILLIAM TOWER ( Rather grimly ) Your mother drove a hard bargain , but , had she known it , she might have driven an even harder one . ANN TOWER ( She is watching him , decides to try him out on a little plan of her own ) Guess who 's coming today , Dad . WILLIAM TOWER Who ? ANN TOWER Allan Frobisher . WILLIAM TOWER ( Very amiably , rather pleased , in fact ) Oh , really ? How is the old pirate ? ANN TOWER If you wait long enough , you 'll probably see for yourself . He generally drops in for a drink about this time . WILLIAM TOWER That 's still on , is it ? ANN TOWER I have a feeling . ( She stops , embarrassed . ) WILLIAM TOWER What , dear ? ANN TOWER That Allan and Mother  --  will get married one of these days . WILLIAM TOWER Speed the day ! p. 13 ANN TOWER What do you mean ? WILLIAM TOWER Simply that if Allan married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declining years . ANN TOWER Have n't you forgiven him yet ? WILLIAM TOWER For what ? ANN TOWER ( A bit awkwardly ) Well . now really , Dad . I 'm sure you . WILLIAM TOWER Oh , that ! My dear Ann , you do n't suppose that was in the least Allan 's doing ! ANN TOWER You 're very tolerant . ( MRS . TOWER comes in . She is chic , gay , assured , and her devotion to calisthenics has kept her willowy . She has a springy walk and knows that she moves well . She is therefore almost constantly in motion . At the moment she is very much upset over the contents of a telegram which she has picked up in the hall and has just read . She is not too surprised to see her former husband , as he is always dropping in from far places . ) MILLICENT TOWER Hello , Willie ! Well , it 's very nice to see you . WILLIAM TOWER Thank you . MILLICENT TOWER I say , he looks splendid , does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful to be a man . You can keep a vestige of your looks without devoting all your life to it . Oh , but my darlings , I 'm really upset . Ann , what do you think has happened ? ( She waves the telegram in the air ) I 've just had this telegram . She 's coming ! She 's coming again ! p. 14 ANN TOWER Who , Mother ? MILLICENT TOWER Who ? Who would put me in such a state ? Jane , of course . Jane Fowler . It really is naughty of her . I have so many engagements , I really do n't know where to turn . WILLIAM TOWER Jane Fowler ? I seem to remember the name . ANN TOWER ( Smiles ) Jane is Mother 's cross . MILLICENT TOWER ( Tragically ) She 's coming tomorrow ! WILLIAM TOWER Jane Fowler ? Is n't that your sister-in-law and does n't she live in Liverpool ? MILLICENT TOWER Not enough ! I never saw her after Harry and I had that row . But when he died Jane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living relative and she makes a fetish of it . ANN TOWER But Mother , she is kind . She does bring you tea-cozies and doilies . She knits them with her own hands . MILLICENT TOWER She 's worthy , she 's dowdy , she 's provincial . She looks twenty years older than I do and she 's perfectly capable of telling anyone she meets that we were at school together . When she comes to London it never occurs to her to stay anywhere but here  --  she thinks it would hurt my feelings  --  and she stays for three or four weeks . Entertains all her Liverpool friends here  --  just as dowdy as she is . Thank God it 's tomorrow and not today . p. 15 WILLIAM TOWER I should think , Millicent , that a woman with your social experience would find a way to deal with a situation like this . MILLICENT TOWER But do n't you see , Willie , I have n't a chance . Jane 's so unbearably kind . She bores me to death , but I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of thing you could do , but I could n't . WILLIAM TOWER I have never believed in encouraging bores . MILLICENT TOWER I know . You retire behind that mask . WILLIAM TOWER ( To ANN ) Shall I lend your mother my mask ? MILLICENT TOWER Tomorrow ! Of all days ! Just when I 've asked dozens of people to dinner . WILLIAM TOWER Everything goes on quite as usual , does n't it ? MILLICENT TOWER ( With some asperity ) I hope , dear , you do n't think life stops in London just because you choose to go to Africa . This is all I needed ! And she 'll expect to see her tea-cozies ! She 'll expect to see her doilies ! WILLIAM TOWER Ca n't you just put them on to grace her visit ? MILLICENT TOWER I 've burnt them ! p. 16 ANN TOWER I do n't care how funny she looks  --  I adore her . She has a heart of gold . MILLICENT TOWER I ca n't bear people with hearts of gold . If this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TOWER ) Jane will force me into going back to Africa with you . WILLIAM TOWER ( To ward off such a possiblity ) I 'm going to India . ANN TOWER ( Laughing ) You frightened him , Mother . MILLICENT TOWER ( Wryly ) Is n't Africa big enough for both of us , Willie ? ANN TOWER Nice to have Dad back in London  --  is n't it , Mother ? MILLICENT TOWER ( Weighing it judiciously ) Well , Id rather have him than Jane . WILLIAM TOWER From the avidity with which you are awaiting this elderly frump from Liverpool , I may take that as a superlative compliment . MILLICENT TOWER Elderly ? She 's not elderly . She 's my age . Am I elderly ? WILLIAM TOWER I 've never seen you look more handsome . ANN TOWER Mother does look well , does n't she ? p. 17 MILLICENT TOWER Oh , the art it takes ! The craft it takes ! When Jane 's here it all goes for nothing . She 's perfectly capable of saying to a full dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me Millie , which I loathe  --  " Millie , dear , do n't you think at your age  --  you should n't do quite so much ? " She 's always telling me that I do too much . After a week of Jane I 'm psychologically ready for a wheel chair , a hot water bottle and a cup of Ovaltine at night . WILLIAM TOWER Is she well off ? MILLICENT TOWER Oh , very . She and my brother built up the largest department store in Liverpool . When he died , Jane sold it for millions ! WILLIAM TOWER ( This clarifies it for him ) Ah ! MILLICENT TOWER Why do you say " Ah " in that cynical way ? WILLIAM TOWER ( Innocent ) Did I say " Ah " ? MILLICENT TOWER You certainly did ! What good does Jane 's fortune do me ? Jane 'll live forever . They always do in Liverpool . And she takes care of herself ! God , how that woman takes care of herself ! She 's in bed every night by ten . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , Dad . ( Kisses the top of his head ) I expect to see a lot of you this time , my fascinating , remote father . p. 18 WILLIAM TOWER As much as you like , my darling . ANN TOWER Wonderful ! ( She goes upstairs . ) MILLICENT TOWER Well , Willie , you 've come in the nick of time . WILLIAM TOWER To meet Jane ? MILLICENT TOWER No . To do something about Ann . She 's your responsibility , too , you know . WILLIAM TOWER What 's wrong with Ann ? She looks very well and seems reasonably happy . MILLICENT TOWER It 's that awful young man she 's involved with . WILLIAM TOWER You mean Peter Crewe ? MILLICENT TOWER Oh , you 've met him . Of course . He 's always here . I simply ca n't bear that boy . WILLIAM TOWER He seems very nice . What 's wrong with him ? MILLICENT TOWER ( Venomously ) He 's so arrogant ! WILLIAM TOWER ( Tolerantly ) That will pass when he has something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penny ! WILLIAM TOWER That is more relevant . p. 19 MILLICENT TOWER Of all the people we know that Ann should pick on him . He has n't even got a job . He ca n't possibly marry her . WILLIAM TOWER Then what are you worried about ? MILLICENT TOWER He 's keeping her from marrying anyone else . It 's high time Ann married and married well . You must see to it , Willie . Exert your authority . WILLIAM TOWER I never heard such nonsense . I am sure the moment I told Ann to give up Peter Crewe it would automatically make permanent what otherwise might be a fleeting attachment . MILLICENT TOWER Oh , I do n't mean that you should forbid her . Nothing as crude as that . Just disparage him . No one in the world is half as good as you at general disparagement . Deflate him . She thinks he 's profound . Make her see that he 's shallow . WILLIAM TOWER In order to deflate this young man I should have to see him , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TOWER Selfish as ever ! Your devotion to yourself amounts to a cult . WILLIAM TOWER I find it as diverting as any other cult . MILLICENT TOWER ( Abruptly ) You have n't said anything about my hair ! p. 20 WILLIAM TOWER ( Looking at it ) You 've done very well by it ! MILLICENT TOWER I do n't know why it is , but gray hair in a man always looks distinguished . In a woman it 's hideous . ( Looks into the mirrored wall ) So I dyed mine . When it 's entirely gray I shall cease to dye it . Then people will say what a young face I have . WILLIAM TOWER They may say so now . MILLICENT TOWER Oh , I never made a secret of my age . I fully admit to forty . WILLIAM TOWER ( Dryly ) Candor could go no further ! MILLICENT TOWER People add five years automatically , so it 's more of an admission than you think . You know , Willie , I do n't think it 's any compliment to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though the experience was so devasting that you dare n't risk it . WILLIAM TOWER It works both ways . Why do n't you ? MILLICENT TOWER ( A bit sentimental ) You were the most maddening and unsatisfactory of husbands . But the fact is  --  after you  --  all the men I meet seem tame . WILLIAM TOWER ( Rallying her ) Still Allan Frobisher is coming today , is n't he ? p. 21 MILLICENT TOWER Yes . He comes every day . I warn you , Willie . WILLIAM TOWER What about ? MILLICENT TOWER Allan is trembling on the brink ! WILLIAM TOWER ( Calmly ) I think I may trust you to push him over . MILLICENT TOWER Oh , well  --  I suppose the time will come when he will tire of all these actresses he runs around with and want to settle down . He 's very impulsive . ( In a dream of romantic speculation ) I wonder what I should say if he suddenly asked me to marry him . WILLIAM TOWER I should articulate , as clearly as possible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ induce me to marry Allan . He 's always rushing off to Birmingham or Manchester or some place to buy a newspaper . His appetite for newspapers is insatiable . WILLIAM TOWER So with all his appetites ! MILLICENT TOWER You know , Willie , it 's not easy to forget you . Your books keep reminding me . I know you so well  --  I see you in all of them . WILLIAM TOWER Why do n't you simply not read them ? p. 22 MILLICENT TOWER I have n't got your self  --  control . I wish I had ! WILSON ( Enters and announces ) Mrs. Fowler ! MILLICENT TOWER ( Horrified , almost screams ) Jane ! ( JANE FOWLER comes in . At first sight she is , indeed , an odd bundle ; one gets the impression of a vital little middle-aged lady activating a mass of old-fashioned and excessive clothing . She wears , over everything else , a cloak that oddly combines severity with fussiness , under it a long dress of heavy stuff , voluminous as though she wore under it innumerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nineteenth century rather than the twentieth . And yet , on closer inspection , one notices first an extraordinary freshness of complexion and clear eyes that look at the world with candor and benevolence . JANE 'S movement and gestures are at variance with the heavy armament of her clothes ; they are lithe , clear cut and direct . She has a winning and lit-up smile . Except sartorially , one gets the impression , oddly , of youth , vitality and clarity of outlook , even eagerness . ) JANE FOWLER ( Fondly ) How are you , Millie dear ? ( They embrace and kiss. ) p. 23 MILLICENT TOWER But Jane ! I was n't expecting you till tomorrow ! JANE FOWLER So Wilson said . But if you looked at the date on my telegram you would have seen that I sent it yesterday . Have you got the telegram ? It said : " Arrive tomorrow . " That 's today . Where is the telegram ? MILLICENT TOWER It does n't matter . I 'm very pleased to see you . JANE FOWLER ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TOWER ( Still recovering ) Oh , this is my . you know . my former hus . JANE FOWLER ( With pleasure ) Is this William Tower ? ( Goes to him ; extends her hand ) I am so pleased to meet you ! WILLIAM TOWER ( Taking her hand ) How do you do ? JANE FOWLER I 've always wanted to meet you . But when you and Millie were married my husband was still alive and we never left Liverpool . We were far too happy to care to travel . MILLICENT TOWER Wo n't you have some tea , Jane ? ( She pushes button on wall. ) p. 24 JANE FOWLER Oh , yes , please . If it would n't be too much trouble . I 'll just take off my mantle . ( She takes off her cloak , which TOWER holds as she turns her back to the audience , revealing a black cardigan sweater she has on underneath . She takes off the scarf around her neck . She then takes her cloak from TOWER ) Thank you . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of the sofa and sits . She does n't remove her hat . Around her neck is a fairly large silver locket on a black ribbon ) There ! That 's a bit more comfortable . Have you found my telegram , Millie ? MILLICENT TOWER It does n't matter now . JANE FOWLER But I want to show you . WILLIAM TOWER ( Takes telegram from desk ) Here is the telegram . JANE FOWLER Ah ! Thank you . ( With a hint of triumph ) There , you see , Millie ! It is dated Liverpool , the seventeenth . And it says , " Arrive tomorrow "  --  that is today  --  the eighteenth . Always look at the date at the top of the telegram . That is the most important thing in a telegram  --  the date it was sent . You remember that . MILLICENT TOWER ( Fuming ) I 'll try ! p. 25 JANE FOWLER How is my darling Ann ? MILLICENT TOWER Oh , very well . She 'll be down in a moment . JANE FOWLER Has she found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish she had n't . JANE FOWLER What do you mean by that , Millie ? MILLICENT TOWER He 's a left-wing maniac who wants us to go to war over Czechoslovakia ! Imagine ! War again ! Where is Czechoslovakia , Willie ? WILLIAM TOWER Do you really want to know , Millicent ? MILLICENT TOWER Not passionately . ( WILSON enters with tea table , followed by maid . They put small tea tables in front of the sofa on which JANE and TOWER are sitting , and in front of chair in which MRS . TOWER is sitting . ) JANE FOWLER Tea ! How wonderful . I am so thirsty . ( To the MAID ) The train was twenty minutes late . ( The MAID gives her an incredulous look and follows WILSON Out ) Wo n't you sit beside me , Mr. Tower ? WILLIAM TOWER ( Complying ) Thank you . p. 26 JANE FOWLER I must tell you straight off I have n't read one of your books . Now I shall . WILLIAM TOWER It is n't compulsory . JANE FOWLER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-read the old ones . WILLIAM TOWER Excellent idea . JANE FOWLER I have seen several of your comedies , though , when they played in Liverpool . They were very interesting . But the characters were strange to me  --  like foreigners . They always seemed so nervous . ( MRS . TOWER rises and serves them with cups of tea ) They made things so hard for themselves . MILLICENT TOWER Why , Jane , what an odd comment ! WILLIAM TOWER It 's perfectly justified . It 's the modern character , Mrs. Fowler . It lacks serenity . JANE FOWLER There was one I remember in which the heroine  --  I suppose you 'd call her the heroine , though her conduct was anything but heroic  --  suddenly took it into her head to have an affair in a pergola . Such an odd choice ! So drafty . So visible ! But it was all very amusing just the same . We enjoyed it very much . WILLIAM TOWER I 'm glad . p. 27 WILSON ( Comes in ) Excuse me , Madam , Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dine but will drop in for a cup of tea . MILLICENT TOWER Thank you , Wilson . ( WILSON goes out . ) JANE FOWLER Lord Frobisher ? That name is familiar . MILLICENT TOWER ( Brushing it off ) Canadian by birth . Ca n't stop buying newspapers . JANE FOWLER Is that Allan Frobisher ? MILLICENT TOWER Yes . Do have some of these cakes , Jane . They 're really very nice . JANE FOWLER Of course . Allan Frobisher . WILLIAM TOWER Do you know him ? JANE FOWLER No . Only through Millie 's conversation . There was a period a few years back , was n't there , Millie , when you simply could n't keep Mr. Frobisher  --  he was n't a lord then  --  out of your conversation ? You were always telling me how wonderful and fascinating he was . I remember thinking such enthusiasm odd in a married woman . Especially ( Turns and smiles at TOWER ) as you already had a husband who was both those things . p. 28 WILLIAM TOWER Thank you , Mrs. Fowler . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Enjoying himself ) I quite agree , Mrs. Fowler . A married woman should have only one enthusiasm  --  her husband . JANE FOWLER ( Literally ) Oh , I quite agree . I remember saying so to Millie . ( Turns to MRS . TOWER ) But wo n't it be rather awkward entertaining Lord Frobisher with Mr. Tower here ? WILLIAM TOWER ( Dramatically ) I shall disappear . JANE FOWLER You must n't do that . Now that I 've just met you , I want to get to know you better . WILLIAM TOWER If you wish me to , I shall stay . JANE FOWLER Thank you . I find you very sympathetic . ( To MRS . TOWER ) What have you done with the tea-cozy I gave you last time ? Do n't you use it ? MILLICENT TOWER ( Puts teapot down guiltily ) Oh , Jane , we used it every day . Unfortunately , we had an accident with it . It got burnt . JANE FOWLER But the last one I gave you got burnt . p. 29 MILLICENT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Smiles forgivingly ) It does n't really matter . I shall enjoy making you another . I 'll go to Liberty 's tomorrow and buy the silks . WILLIAM TOWER ( Noticing the locket she is wearing ) What a lovely locket ! JANE FOWLER Do you like it ? WILLIAM TOWER Its very pretty . JANE FOWLER I 'm so glad you like old things . My husband gave me this when we were married . It contains his photograph . Would you like to see him ? WILLIAM TOWER Very much . JANE FOWLER ( Snapping it open and displaying it ) There he is . WILLIAM TOWER Very handsome . I love that cravat and those mustaches . So masculine . So flamboyant . JANE FOWLER ( Snapping locket back ) And he was as good as he was handsome . Millie was at the wedding . ( Turns to MRS . TOWER , who is drinking her tea ) Do you remember , Millie ? MILLICENT TOWER Oh . yes . vaguely . p. 30 JANE FOWLER It will be thirty-one years ago next Wednesday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember because the next day was Millie 's birthday and I saved her a piece of the wedding cake . Do you remember that birthday party , Millie ? It was your twenty-first MILLICENT TOWER ( Cutting in quickly ) Do have one of these cakes , Jane . They 're really quite delicious . JANE FOWLER ( Munching one ) U-m-m . They are good . WILLIAM TOWER ( Sadistic ) What an excellent memory your sister-in-law has , Millicent ! MILLICENT TOWER ( Acidly ) Yes . Has n't she ? JANE FOWLER When you live quietly and do little you remember more . I always think Millie does too much . You would n't think , to look at us , would you , Mr. Tower , that Millie and I were at school together ? But of course I 've lived a very quiet life . WILLIAM TOWER Millicent , your charming sister-in-law has a gift for innuendo . JANE FOWLER ( Genuinely inquiring ) What do you mean by that , William ? May I call you William ? p. 31 WILLIAM TOWER Certainly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between us . MILLICENT TOWER ( Witheringly ) He is known , by those who fancy themselves his intimates , as " Willie . " JANE FOWLER That is much too informal for an author as famous as he is . I shall call you William . ( Smiles at TOWER ) That 's how I 've always thought of you . When you and Millie were married I used to say in my letters to her " Give my love to dear William . " Did n't she ever do it ? WILLIAM TOWER Invariably . And I was always so happy to get your love . JANE FOWLER Thank you , William . ( But she never lets slip a point ; she fixes TOWER with her clear , steady glance ) What did you mean just now when you said I had a gift for innuendo ? WILLIAM TOWER ( Sincerely ) Forgive me ! JANE FOWLER Why ? It would be a very nice gift to have . I have n't got it , I 'm afraid . ( A considerable pause . JANE is enjoying her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TOWERS benignly ) Is n't it nice not to have to talk ? One can do that only with relations who understand each other and who love each other . p. 32 WILLIAM TOWER When I 'm stuck in a conversation I always flatter . That 's always the safe thing . JANE FOWLER ( Rather shocked ) Flatter ? WILLIAM TOWER Yes . Nearly everyone 's vain , do n't you think ? JANE FOWLER I suppose so . Still , if you will forgive me , William , I do n't quite see that . If the person that you flatter is intelligent he knows what you 're doing . If he is n't , why do you want his good opinion ? WILLIAM TOWER I do n't want his good opinion . I just want to fill in those awful pauses in conversation . JANE FOWLER Oh , I love a pause in a conversation . It always gives me time to collect my thoughts . ( There follows a pause in the conversation  --  quite a longish one . JANE is making a hearty tea . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one , Mrs. Fowler . Are you collecting your thoughts ? JANE FOWLER You must call me Jane . WILLIAM TOWER Jane . Are you collecting your thoughts , Jane ? JANE FOWLER Yes . I have some news which I am getting ready to tell you . p. 33 MILLICENT TOWER News . What news , Jane ? JANE FOWLER I am so glad you are here , too , William , so that you will hear it as well . Although I have only just met you I do look upon you as one of the family . MILLICENT TOWER Is n't that nice ? That 's just how Willie loves to be looked on . JANE FOWLER ( A little severely ) After all , he is Ann 's father . I still think of him as related to you , Millie . MILLICENT TOWER ( To TOWER ) Jane sets great store by relations . JANE FOWLER When all else fails us we have them . WILLIAM TOWER But what is your news , Jane ? I am agog to hear . JANE FOWLER I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) What ? WILLIAM TOWER My congratulations . JANE FOWLER Thank you , William . MILLICENT TOWER Jane , you 're not serious . JANE FOWLER One dos n't marry if one is not serious . That is why I came just at this particular moment . I 'm going to be married tomorrow morning . You shall come with me to the Registrar 's , of course . And you too , William . p. 34 WILLIAM TOWER I am going to India . JANE FOWLER Tomorrow ? MILLICENT TOWER Tell us all about it . Who is it ? Who 's the lucky bridegroom ? JANE FOWLER I have asked my young man to come here to meet you . You 'll see him very soon . MILLICENT TOWER ( Chuckling ) It 's too sweet to hear you talk about your young man ! JANE FOWLER You must n't expect anyone too old . You would n't want me to marry some decrepit old man with one foot in the grave , would you ? ( She giggles . ) MILLICENT TOWER Oh , Jane , how wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in Liverpool ? JANE FOWLER No . My young man 's profession requires that we live in London . MILLICENT TOWER ( A horrid chasm yawns before her ) Oh ! JANE FOWLER So you and I shall be able to see a lot of each other . Wo n't that be lovely ? MILLICENT TOWER Yes , heavenly ! JANE FOWLER And I hope we shall see a lot of you too , William . p. 35 WILLIAM TOWER Unfortunately I am going to India . JANE FOWLER Yes , I know . So you said . But surely not tomorrow . I insist upon your being a witness at our wedding . My young man is such a dear ! I do hope you 'll like him . MILLICENT TOWER I 'm sure we shall . I ca n't wait to meet him . JANE FOWLER He 'll be here any minute . If you will excuse me . ( She rises , as does TOWER , and starts taking her things off sofa . TOWER helps her ) I shall go upstairs and get out of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TOWER Yes , dear . JANE FOWLER You 're not going right away , are you , William ? WILLIAM TOWER Certainly not . Not till I 've met your " young man . " JANE FOWLER ( With a shy , winning smile ) I see you do n't believe in my young man . Is Ann in her room ? I must look in and tell her . ( She stops a moment at the stair landing ) I 'm so pleased to have met you at last , William . I always thought you 'd be rather formidable . You 're not a bit . You 're , if I may say so , you 're quite  --  cozy ! ( She goes upstairs. ) p. 36 MILLICENT TOWER ( The moment JANE has gone , pounces on TOWER ) Well , my cozy boy , what do you make of that ? WILLIAM TOWER I 'm certainly curious to see what he 's like . MILLICENT TOWER Ca n't you imagine ? Very big and massive , with an enormous gold chain across an enormous tummy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILLIAM TOWER Did you notice when she spoke of her young man her voice got a bit funny and tremulous ? MILLICENT TOWER Yes . It made me want to laugh . WILLIAM TOWER I found it rather touching . MILLICENT TOWER Do n't be sentimental , Willie . It does n't become you . WILLIAM TOWER I am rarely accused of being sentimental . I insist  --  in view of what Jane 's young man probably is  --  I found it touching . MILLICENT TOWER Do n't you love the way she treated us like a happy family quivering with the joy of reunion ? Really , Jane is unique . Can you imagine that such people still exist ? WILLIAM TOWER If she knew us better she might find it hard to believe that we exist ! p. 37 WILSON ( Enters and announces ) Lord Frobisher ! ( ALLAN FROBISHER is in his early fifties , medium-sized but so instinct with success and power that he seems , somehow , a bit larger than life . He is crusty , sadistic , humorous , aware of his reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He has discovered that people who have , on their own , achieved the success in life that he has can be overbearing and brutal and that it only serves to build up the popular picture of them as salty characters . ) MILLICENT TOWER Oh , Allan . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER Hello , Millicent . And Willie ! Quite like old times . How are you ? WILLIAM TOWER Very well , thank you . ( They shake hands ) I need n't ask you . Obviously , you are flourishing . MILLICENT TOWER Oh , Allan 's a miracle of survival ! LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( A glance at MRS . TOWER ) There 's a sting in that somewhere . But I do n't mind a bit . ( To TOWER ) Why , Willie , I wake up every morning feeling that life is a new adventure . Resent sleeping . WILLIAM TOWER How do you keep so young ? Is it those grubby newspapers ? p. 38 LORD ALLAN FROBISHER Women ! Try them . WILLIAM TOWER ( To MRS . TOWER ) Allan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER You have n't changed a bit , have you , Willie  --  which is rather regrettable . MILLICENT TOWER ( To FROBISHER ) Do n't think you can make up for canceling dinner by just dropping in for tea . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER European situation looked a bit sultry . Thought I 'd better stay close to the office . MILLICENT TOWER Nonsense ! I 'm sure it 's a glamour girl . I 'll ring for some more tea . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER Do n't bother . I 'll have a whiskey . ( He goes to liquor table and pours himself a drink . Addresses TOWER ) When I was young  --  I do n't in the least mind admitting it  --  I was notoriously unsuccessful with women , and now I 'm making up for lost time . When I first barged in on London from Canada , I was very poor and considered insufferably brash . Now that I have money and power that same quality passes for strength  --  rugged strength . WILLIAM TOWER I still call it brash ! p. 39 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What I like about Allan is his innate vulgarity , do n't you , Willie ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER As my father was a blacksmith and my grandfather an indentured servant , I 'm under no obligation to be refined . Everybody loves women secretly . Everybody is polygamous  --  secretly ; I am  --  openly . MILLICENT TOWER Allan 's perpetually in love with someone . I find it very tiresome . WILLIAM TOWER Not in love , Millicent . That implies a spiritual quality that Allan lacks . It 's simply that he is frightened by what the doctors call " the atrophy of disuse . " LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( Chuckles ) You 're right , Willie . " Never stop " is my motto . Once you stop  --  you 're done for . When I go to these boring public dinners and hear these great swells spout their hollow abstractions  --  I 've done it myself  --  have to in my position  --  as I look around the room at their pious expressions I think : " What women are they really thinking of ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TOWER How crowded your brain must be ! LORD ALLAN FROBISHER Teeming ! p. 40 WILLIAM TOWER You know , Millicent , I should like to devise a coat of arms for Allan : all the actresses in London " couchant " and he over them , brandishing a limp sword of papier mch . MILLICENT TOWER Willie , you 're wicked . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER He 's jealous , that 's all . WILLIAM TOWER How 's your asthma ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER I rise above it . I say , Willie ! While you 're doing nothing , why do n't you go to work for me ? Biggest circulation in London , you know . WILLIAM TOWER I know your circulation is big , Allan , but can it read ? JANE FOWLER ( Coming down stairs ) Millie , was that my young man ? ( She has changed to a black dress of a style belonging to the early 1900 's . Her hair is parted in the middle , covering her ears . She has a narrow black ribbon tied around it . ) MILLICENT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Jane , this is Lord Frobisher . Allan , this is my sister-in-law , Mrs. Fowler . JANE FOWLER ( Rather primly , she disapproves of him ) How do you do ? p. 41 LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( He rather squints at the apparition of JANE ; he has no taste , unlike TOWER , for that sort of thing ) I 'm very well thank you . JANE FOWLER Why do you stare at me ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER Do I ? Sorry . JANE FOWLER We , at home , consider it rude to stare . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( His back up a bit ) Stared ! Of course I stared . When she came down I thought it was Queen Victoria . Now by God I see I was right . MILLICENT TOWER ( Idiotically ) My sister-in-law lives in Liverpool . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER That explains it . ( Moves toward JANE , still staring at her as though he were in a zoo ) I 've just bought a paper there . JANE FOWLER Yes , I know you have . The Star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wretched newspaper . We never take it . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER I 'm afraid you 're in a minority , Mrs. Fowler . WILLIAM TOWER ( Enjoying himself ) Has n't Allan improved it ? p. 42 JANE FOWLER Not a bit . Before he bought it , it was quite easy not to read it . Now Lord Frobisher has filled it full of the most sensational photographs and it is really very difficult not to look at it . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( Chuckles ) That effect , dear , dear Mrs. Fowler is not uncalculated . JANE FOWLER ( Blandly ) I am sure , Lord Frobisher , that that is true of most of your effects . ( Turns to MRS . TOWER ) But where is my young man ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER Is your son as original as you are , Mrs. Fowler ? JANE FOWLER I have no son . I am referring to my fianc . MILLICENT TOWER ( Simply floundering ) It 's a happy event , Allan . Jane has just announced her engagement . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER My congratulations ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prince Albert ? JANE FOWLER ( With benign mildness  --  to MRS . TOWER ) It amazes me , Millie , that you could have left a mature man like my dear William for an elderly adolescent like Lord Frobisher ! ( FROBISHER glares . MRS . TOWER totters . Only TOWER is in ecstasy. ) p. 43 WILLIAM TOWER Allan , my dear sister-in-law has a gift for epitaph . " Elderly Adolescent ! " That will be written on your tombstone . ( He sinks on his knees before JANE ) Millicent , will you remarry me so that I may once again be Jane 's brother-in-law ? MILLICENT TOWER Do n't be absurd , Willie . JANE FOWLER ( Blushing a little ) Do get up , William . But I think you should remarry Millie . I shall bless the reunion . WILSON ( Enters and announces ) Mr. Gilbert Dabney ! JANE FOWLER ( Rises , but TOWER still holds her hand ) My young man ! Gilbert ( GILBERT is about thirty , slight , tallish , attractive , with a deprecatory , half-humorous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his knees before JANE . ) GILBERT DABNEY ( With mock consternation ) What , Jane ? Already ? JANE FOWLER ( A little disconcerted ) Get up , William ! GILBERT DABNEY I had n't expected this sort of thing till after we were married . p. 44 JANE FOWLER It 's only my brother-in-law . He 's been to Africa and he 's going to India . GILBERT DABNEY ( Easily ) Well , that explains it . ( TOWER finally lets go of JANE 's hand , sits back on his heels , contemplating the phenomenon . ) JANE FOWLER Millie , this is my young man . I do hope you like him . GILBERT DABNEY How do you do ? ( But MRS . TOWER is so boulevers she can only make her lips move in greeting . ) JANE FOWLER And this . ( Turns and sees TOWER still on his knees ) Oh , get up , William ! ( She helps him rise ) And this is William Tower , Millie 's ex-husband . He 's like one of the family . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TOWER shake hands . ) WILLIAM TOWER ( In seventh heaven ) I 'm singularly happy . JANE FOWLER ( Indicating FROBISHER with a faint asperity ) And this is Lord Frobisher . GILBERT DABNEY ( Catches JANE 's attitude and shares it ) How do you do ? ( FROBISHER is transfixed ) Why do you stare ? Is my tie on wrong or something ? p. 45 JANE FOWLER Do n't mind him , Gilbert . Lord Frobisher has n't learned , evidently , that it is rude to stare . MILLICENT TOWER ( Finally finding speech ) Jane ! Really . JANE FOWLER ( Looks at her , concerned ) What 's the matter , Millie ? You have an unusually high color . MILLICENT TOWER ( Gasps ) I probably put on too much rouge . JANE FOWLER Oh , is it rouge ? I thought it was natural . Otherwise , I should n't have mentioned it . ( Gives GILBERT a shy smile ) You know , Gilbert , Millie and I were at school together . GILBERT DABNEY ( Out to captivate MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Tower , Jane sets such store by you  --  I have been quite tense about meeting you . I 'm so afraid that if you do n't approve of me Jane will drop me . So please approve . MILLICENT TOWER ( Off her social balance for once ) It 's a bit early . GILBERT DABNEY ( Smiles at her ) It may be worse later . ( To FROBISHER ) It 's so nice to like people right off  --  from the beginning , do n't you think ? It may be the only chance to really enjoy them . ( But FROBISHER is still in aspic ) Yes . ( He gives up there and turns to MRS . TOWER ) After that , things are apt to get a bit frayed , do n't you think ? p. 46 MILLICENT TOWER ( Trembling , venomous ) Well , there is a certain disparity of age between you ! WILLIAM TOWER Shall you be in London long , Jane ? While you 're here I want to see as much of you as possible . JANE FOWLER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TOWER ( To GILBERT ) Do you expect to be away long ? GILBERT DABNEY I have arranged with the office to stay away for two months . JANE FOWLER It will be such a treat for him . He 's never had more than a fortnight 's holiday before . MILLICENT TOWER Why not ? GILBERT DABNEY I 've never been able to afford it . MILLICENT TOWER ( Putting volumes into the exclamation ) Ah ! WILLIAM TOWER Millicent , did you say " Ah " ? MILLICENT TOWER ( With asperity ) Yes , I did and I meant every word of it . GILBERT DABNEY ( To TOWER ) Jane hoped I would make a good impression on her family . Am I succeeding , do you think ? p. 47 WILLIAM TOWER You 're succeeding with me all right . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( He has had enough ) Well , thank you , Millicent for a most diverting afternoon . MILLICENT TOWER I 've hardly seen you at all . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER I 'll ring you tomorrow . You must get your sister-in-law over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm seeing your play tonight and taking Muriel Kerr to supper afterwards . Wo n't you join us ? It 'll be a big thrill for Muriel to meet the author . WILLIAM TOWER Thank you very much but unfortunately I 'm busy . MILLICENT TOWER It 's Muriel now , is it ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER I hope it will be . WILLIAM TOWER ( Eager to whip things up ) You know , Jane , Lord Frobisher is the most expert philanderer in London . JANE FOWLER ( Objectively ) At his age ? Is it becoming ? WILLIAM TOWER ( Keeping the fire going ) He has a sort of vintage boyishness , do n't you think ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( Nettled to open attack ) Your sense of decorum is extremely acute , Mrs. Fowler . You are very critical of other people 's indulgences . Does n't it  --  in the circumstances  --  ( He looks from her to GILBERT ) show a lack of humor ? p. 48 JANE FOWLER ( With dignity , takes GILBERT 'S hand ) Gilbert and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALLAN FROBISHER ( Helpless ) I give up ! WILLIAM TOWER ( Simmering with delight ) This is the second time I 've seen Allan so frustrated . JANE FOWLER ( Not above wanting instances ) Really ? What was the first time ? WILLIAM TOWER The first time was when he was staying with me in my villa in the South of France . A highly respectable American lady novelist was staying with me also . Allan came down to the swimming pool stark naked . She did n't bat an eyelash ! JANE FOWLER ( Gravely ) I hope she managed to conceal her disappointment . WILLIAM TOWER ( With mock disapproval ) Now that , Jane , quite literally , is hitting below the belt ! LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( Can take no more ) Good-bye , Millicent . Another ten minutes with your sister-in-law would permanently undermine my confidence . ( He goes out. ) p. 49 JANE FOWLER ( Reflectively ) Millie , dear , how could you have made such a mistake ? To have abandoned my dear William . MILLICENT TOWER ( She can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! WILLIAM TOWER Jane has an acute sense of values , Millicent . MILLICENT TOWER ( Savage ) Willie ! I want to talk to Jane . JANE FOWLER What are we doing now ? MILLICENT TOWER Willie , take Mr. Dabney into the library . WILLIAM TOWER But I 'd much rather stay here and deepen my acquaintance with Jane . JANE FOWLER We shall have plenty of time for that , William . You go along . I promise to tell you everything that Millie says . WILLIAM TOWER On that condition I will . ( To GILBERT ) Come along , young man . GILBERT DABNEY ( As he starts to go with TOWER into the library ) Stiff upper lip , Jane . WILLIAM TOWER ( To GILBERT ) How do you feel on the eve of your great adventure ? p. 50 GILBERT DABNEY Well , I 've been all through it once before , you know . WILLIAM TOWER Have you , really ? Well , come in here and tell me all about it . ( They go , closing library door after them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone ) Jane ! Are you crazy ? What makes you want to marry this young man ? JANE FOWLER Partly because he wo n't take " no " for an answer . MILLICENT TOWER And why do you suppose he wants to marry you ? JANE FOWLER I amuse him . MILLICENT TOWER Amuse him ! JANE FOWLER So he keeps telling me . MILLICENT TOWER Where did you meet him , anyway ? JANE FOWLER I advertised for him . MILLICENT TOWER Oh ! In Cupid 's Column , I suppose . JANE FOWLER No , in the Times . I advertised for a young architect , without an expensive reputation , to re-do my house in Liverpool . And Gilbert came . MILLICENT TOWER He 's penniless and you 're rich . You ca n't be such a fool as not to see that he 's marrying you for your money ! p. 51 JANE FOWLER I do n't think he is , you know . I think he 's very fond of me . MILLICENT TOWER You 're an old woman , Jane . JANE FOWLER I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TOWER I 've never let myself go . I 'm very young for my age . No one would take me for more than forty . But even I would n't think of marrying a boy twenty years younger than I am . JANE FOWLER Would n't you ? MILLICENT TOWER Do you mean to say it 's possible for a young man to fall in love with a woman old enough to be his mother ? Oh , now really , Jane , I always thought you were a sensible woman . You 're the last person in the world I should have ever thought likely to fall in love with a boy . JANE FOWLER But I 'm not in love with him . I 've told him that . MILLICENT TOWER If you 're not in love with him , why do you want to marry him ? JANE FOWLER ( Calmly ) I 've been a widow a very long time . I thought I 'd like a change . MILLICENT TOWER If you want to marry for the sake of being married , why do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JANE FOWLER No man of my own age has asked me . In fact , no one has asked me at all except Gilbert and he had to ask me five times . ( She chuckles . ) MILLICENT TOWER ( Increasingly furious ) Do n't laugh , Jane . Really , you must be out of your mind . ( Begins to weep suddenly ) It 's dreadful ! JANE FOWLER ( Regards her with composure ) Do n't cry , Millie . MILLICENT TOWER ( Into her handkerchief ) You 're going to be so dreadfully unhappy . JANE FOWLER I do n't think we are , you know . We 've talked it over very thoroughly . He was married once before to a girl of his own age . MILLICENT TOWER He 's certainly going to the other extreme . JANE FOWLER She ran away from him to marry a rich American . She made him very unhappy . He told me so . MILLICENT TOWER How much money has he persuaded you to settle on him ? JANE FOWLER I wanted to settle a thousand a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . MILLICENT TOWER He 's more cunning than I thought . p. 53 JANE FOWLER Millie dear , you do misunderstand him . MILLICENT TOWER I am too upset to go on . I must look a fright . I must go and restore my face , if possible , to it 's original condition . We 'll talk it all over in the morning . JANE FOWLER I 'm afraid that wo n't be convenient . Gilbert and I are going to be married in the morning . MILLICENT TOWER You 're hopeless . JANE FOWLER Millie dear , I 'm so fond of you . MILLICENT TOWER Do n't be emotional . I 've got people coming to dinner . ( Opens door to library ) Mr. Dabney , you can come out now . I want to talk to Willie . ( She goes into library , leaving door open . ) GILBERT DABNEY ( Enters from library , closes the door ) Jane ! Why , Jane darling , we seem to have caused a sensation ! ( Takes her hands ) It 's very agreeable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soberly ) I had n't realized , till I saw the effect on my family , what an odd thing it is , apparently , that we 're doing . GILBERT DABNEY The only one who did n't seem to mind a bit is Mr. Tower . p. 54 JANE FOWLER He enjoyed it because it made the others uncomfortable . GILBERT DABNEY Of course ! How shrewd you are , Jane ! JANE FOWLER They think I 've exercised a hypnotic spell over you . Have I ? GILBERT DABNEY Of course you have . The vampire of Liverpool . The Lorelei of the Mersey ! JANE FOWLER You know , they make me feel as if . GILBERT DABNEY How do they make you feel ? JANE FOWLER As if instead of marrying you  --  I should adopt you ! It 's obvious they think you 're marrying me for my money . GILBERT DABNEY I 'm sure they do . Oh , Jane , what fun we shall have ! JANE FOWLER You have one more chance , you know . GILBERT DABNEY For what ? JANE FOWLER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late . GILBERT DABNEY I 'll wait till it 's too late . JANE FOWLER Are you quite sure ? GILBERT DABNEY Perfectly ! JANE FOWLER You know  --  I have told you  --  that although I could n't be more fond of anyone than I am of you  --  I am not in love with you . p. 55 GILBERT DABNEY ( With mock conceit ) That 's because you only know me superficially . As you become more familiar with the beauty and the depth of my character , you will gradually fall madly in love with me . JANE FOWLER ( Fondly pats his cheek ) Oh , Gilbert , you are sweet ! GILBERT DABNEY With your directness and my subtlety we 'll strike a perfect balance . JANE FOWLER We are quite different , you know . GILBERT DABNEY I know we are . That 's the fun of it ! JANE FOWLER I am mature and deliberate . You are young and impulsive . Therefore , I think we ought to make it clear at the outset . GILBERT DABNEY Yes , Jane , clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood between us that if either of us wants our freedom  --  the other will put no obstacle in the way of his getting it . GILBERT DABNEY ( Quite misunder standing her ) You do n't really believe in my love for you , do you ? JANE FOWLER Yes , I do . GILBERT DABNEY Then why do you want this ridiculous proviso ? p. 56 JANE FOWLER ( Demurely ) Well , it works both ways , does n't it ? I said : if either of us wants our freedom . GILBERT DABNEY ( Persists in his misinterpretation ) You 're the most gallant creature in the world ! Of course , you shall have your proviso . But if I ever take advantage of it , it will mean that I have lost entirely the little good sense that I flatter myself I have . JANE FOWLER I think we have protected ourselves in every way possible , do n't you ? GILBERT DABNEY Yes , vampire . JANE FOWLER ( Moved , utters a little prayer ) Bless us ! GILBERT DABNEY ( Equally moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment ) Shall we go for a little stroll in the garden ? It 's spring in the garden . I 'd like to show you Millie 's roses . GILBERT DABNEY ( Rises , takes her hand and leads her to French doors ) I 'd adore to see Millie 's roses . I 'd prefer it , frankly , to seeing Millie . JANE FOWLER You must n't say that , Gilbert . She is my dear husband 's only sister . p. 57 GILBERT DABNEY ( As they stop at garden door and face each other ) Well , she wo n't be by this time tomorrow . Oh , Jane , what fun we shall have ! JANE FOWLER Yes , Gilbert  --  I have no doubt  --  we shall have fun together ! ( Arms locked , looking tenderly into each other 's eyes , they go out into the garden . After a moment MRS . TOWER comes in from the library , followed immediately by TOWER . She goes to French doors as he goes to liquor table and pours himself a glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become of the young couple ? MILLICENT TOWER Do n't joke , Willie . It 's not funny . WILLIAM TOWER Well , half of them is a young couple , anyway . MILLICENT TOWER You 're enjoying this far too much , Willie . It 's a tragedy . That 's what it is  --  a tragedy ! WILLIAM TOWER Why ? They seem very fond of each other . MILLICENT TOWER Fond ! Fond ! You do n't think he 's marrying her for anything but her money , do you ? WILLIAM TOWER Well , if it does n't work out you 'll at least have the consolation of saying : " I told you so . " p. 58 MILLICENT TOWER Jane ! Can you imagine ! So old and dowdy and dull ! WILLIAM TOWER Are you quite sure she 's dull ? MILLICENT TOWER What else is she ? WILLIAM TOWER What she does say is very much to the point . MILLICENT TOWER Nonsense ! I 've never heard her make a joke in my life ! Well , Willie , how much do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six months at most . ( With a twinge of jealousy ) Fancy  --  finding a young man like that in Liverpool ! And she advertised for him ! Would you believe that Willie  --  she advertised ! WILLIAM TOWER Well , why do n't you do the same , Millicent ? In one of Allan 's papers . I 'm sure he 'd give you a reduced rate . MILLICENT TOWER Oh , Willie  --  you 're maddening ! ( She hits him with her floppy straw hat and walks away from him . She is out of sorts with everything ) So is Jane ! So is everybody ! TOWER sips his sherry happily as the curtain falls. @x At Rise : WILSON shows in TOWER . TOWER looks around the room . He picks up a copy of Punch and is glancing at it when MRS . TOWER comes in from the garden in gardening hat and carrying large shears . MILLICENT TOWER Willie ! When did you get back ? WILLIAM TOWER This morning . ( They kiss lightly . ) MILLICENT TOWER After six months you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stroll in St. James 's Park . Did you have a good time in India ? WILLIAM TOWER Fascinating . MILLICENT TOWER ( Enviously ) You always have a wonderful time , do n't you , Willie ? WILLIAM TOWER You do n't exactly wear a hair shirt yourself , Millicent . You 're looking lovely . MILLICENT TOWER I do n't feel lovely . I 'm in a state . WILLIAM TOWER What about ? MILLICENT TOWER Everything . WILLIAM TOWER How is Ann ? p. 60 MILLICENT TOWER She 's one of the things I 'm in a state about . WILLIAM TOWER What 's wrong ? MILLICENT TOWER It 's that awful Peter Crewe . WILLIAM TOWER Is that still on ? MILLICENT TOWER On ? It 's incessant . She might just as well be married to him for all the attention she pays anyone else . WILLIAM TOWER Ann usually runs through them faster than that . MILLICENT TOWER ( As if it were a personal affront ) He 's actually had a book of poems published . WILLIAM TOWER Has he ? Have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I 've looked at it . The critics all raved about it but personally I could n't make head or tail of it . Not a rhyme to hang on to . WILLIAM TOWER What else are you in a state about ? MILLICENT TOWER Well , do you remember my sister-in-law whom you met the last time you were here ? WILLIAM TOWER Oh , yes  --  that quaint , elderly frump from Liverpool . Of course I do . MILLICENT TOWER ( Bitterly ) Yes , well , that quaint elderly frump from Liverpool is now the reigning social success of London . p. 61 WILLIAM TOWER Nonsense ! MILLICENT TOWER Wait till you see , Willie , wait till you see . You 're going to get the surprise of your life . WILLIAM TOWER Am I ? I 'm scarcely likely to meet her . MILLICENT TOWER She and Gilbert are both living here . WILLIAM TOWER That marriage still on ? I remember you gave it six months . MILLICENT TOWER I 've taken an extension . WILLIAM TOWER As it 's lasted so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it would n't last and I still say it wo n't last . It 's contrary to human nature . WILLIAM TOWER Human nature is often contrary . MILLICENT TOWER There 's something very mysterious going on between Allan and Jane . WILLIAM TOWER Allan ? I should n't think Jane was in the least Allan 's dish . MILLICENT TOWER Perhaps he 's changed his diet . They quarrel all the time . God knows what about . WILLIAM TOWER That sounds very ominous . And Gilbert MILLICENT TOWER He 's bound to leave her . It 's inevitable . He 's such a charming , attractive young man . p. 62 WILLIAM TOWER Why are they living here ? MILLICENT TOWER They 're staying here till Jane 's house is ready . She 's taken a long lease on a house in Belgrave Square and Gilbert is redecorating it for her . WILLIAM TOWER I must say it 's very generous of you to have them here . MILLICENT TOWER You do n't know , Willie , you do n't know . WILLIAM TOWER What do n't I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's house . He 's reupholstered Jane ! WILLIAM TOWER Really ? MILLICENT TOWER Really . It 's galling to think that people who never came here before now come here on account of Jane ! She 's become a sort of fad . WILLIAM TOWER Really ! MILLICENT TOWER Really ! Cabinet ministers  --  royalty  --  film stars , even ! And the extraordinary thing is they all think she 's so amusing . WILLIAM TOWER People can never resist those who make them laugh , my dear Millicent . MILLICENT TOWER I do n't think she 's a bit funny . Of course I laugh when I see other people doing it because I do n't want to appear a perfect fool . But I 'm never in the least amused . p. 63 WILLIAM TOWER You always liked notorious people . Just relax and enjoy it . Gather ye rosebuds while ye may ! MILLICENT TOWER I do , but I resent it . Every rosebud . I ca n't wait for Jane 's house to be ready so she can pack up and get out of here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your breath away ! WILLIAM TOWER For instance ? MILLICENT TOWER Last week I gave a lunch party and Lady St. Earth was here . Everybody was talking about Eden 's resignation over that nonsense in Ethiopia . As if anybody cared about Ethiopia ( She pops some birdseed in to her canaries . ) WILLIAM TOWER Well ? MILLICENT TOWER Well , Lady St. Earth was saying that Eden was like a servant who quits because he knows he 's going to be kicked out anyway . And what do you think Jane said ? WILLIAM TOWER I ca n't imagine . MILLICENT TOWER In that maddeningly innocent little voice of hers , I was horrified to hear her say : " Perhaps , Lady St. Earth "  --  I could n't believe my ears  --  " perhaps , Lady St. Earth , you understand a servant 's mentality better than you do Mr. Eden 's ! " ( TOWER laughs ) It 's no laughing matter , Willie . Lady St. Earth was out of the house in five minutes and has n't been back since . p. 64 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be grateful to Jane . MILLICENT TOWER It ca n't go on much longer . There 's bound to be a blow up . WILLIAM TOWER I hope to be present when it occurs ! MILLICENT TOWER And when it does I hope you 'll assume your responsibilities and do something about Ann . But instead of that , I suppose you 'll be popping off to Afghanistan at any moment . WILLIAM TOWER Tibet . MILLICENT TOWER What ? WILLIAM TOWER ( In the interest of accuracy ) I am not going to Afghanistan . I am going to Tibet . MILLICENT TOWER While you 're playing around with all those lamas ( TOWER laughs ) What are you laughing at ? WILLIAM TOWER My dear Millicent , the lamas are rather exclusive . You ca n't play around with them . MILLICENT TOWER Well , while you are playing around with whatever they have in Tibet , I suppose I shall be left here wrestling with Ann 's problems . Oh , dear , life is difficult ! WILLIAM TOWER It 's practically impossible . The moment you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( One of her abrupt transitions ) Jane prophesies that you and I will remarry . WILLIAM TOWER ( Interested ) Does she ? MILLICENT TOWER ( Tantalizing ) Yes . Do you believe in prophecy ? WILLIAM TOWER ( Laconic ) I believe in free will . MILLICENT TOWER In your stories people are always swallowed up by a destiny they ca n't escape . WILLIAM TOWER I never read my stories . MILLICENT TOWER ( Still in pursuit ) Jane says if you 're not careful you 'll let yourself in for a lonely old age . Are n't you afraid of that ? WILLIAM TOWER My dear Millicent , I do not have to wait for old age to know loneliness . I have known it since I was a child . MILLICENT TOWER ( Frustrated ) I ca n't cope with you . WILLIAM TOWER ( With a charming smile ) Is n't it nice you do n't have to ? MILLICENT TOWER The truth is you 're vindictive . Sometimes I think you took advantage of the incident with Allan to leave me high and dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the charming room ) Many people would n't mind being left high and dry in these surroundings . MILLICENT TOWER You 're such a materialist ! You worship success . WILLIAM TOWER ( Quiet but accurate in aim ) If my worship were unrequited , you might be even more bitter . MILLICENT TOWER Let 's drop the subject . WILLIAM TOWER With happiness . ( GILBERT comes down the stairs , dressed in tails . ) GILBERT DABNEY Oh , Millicent ( Sees TOWER , is pleased ) Oh , hello , Mr. Tower ! WILLIAM TOWER The bridegroom ! ( They shake hands . ) GILBERT DABNEY I 'm not a bridegroom any more . I 'm a settled married man . WILLIAM TOWER Where is the bride ? I 'm longing to see the bride . GILBERT DABNEY She 's upstairs changing . Do you know how she spent her afternoon ? I invited her to come round and see what I 'm planning for the old house in Belgrave Square . Do you know what she preferred to do ? p. 67 WILLIAM TOWER What ? GILBERT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend to see an exhibition of modern art . Can you imagine spending an afternoon observing those horrors ? Those detached eyes swimming in tomato sauce , those curves copulating with angles ? MILLICENT TOWER ( Touching herself up at the glass wall ) Gilbert , do n't be so vivid ! GILBERT DABNEY I must say , Millicent , if I could be annoyed with Jane , I should be at this moment . MILLICENT TOWER Why ? GILBERT DABNEY I 've just been round to see Lady St. Earth . You know I was going to do her new house for her in Park Lane . Well , it 's off ! MILLICENT TOWER ( Pleased ) I should think it would be . GILBERT DABNEY Jane 's unfortunate remark to her cost me an important commission . MILLICENT TOWER Why do n't you shut Jane up ? GILBERT DABNEY That 's a tall order . ( With a note of petulance not wasted on TOWER ) Well , the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away . MILLICENT TOWER ( With melting sympathy , to GILBERT ) You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband as gifted as you are , she 'd do all she could to further your career  --  not to antagonize your prospects . I think it 's outrageous ! p. 68 WILLIAM TOWER How considerate of you , Millicent , to point it out ! Always thinking of others . MILLICENT TOWER Of course you 'd sympathize with Jane . You 're both such egotists . ( To GILBERT ) I do n't think they know how talented you are ! ( To TOWER ) You should see his plans for the new house , Willie . They 're brilliant . GILBERT DABNEY ( To MRS . TOWER as he surveys the room ) I 'd like to do this one over for you some day . MILLICENT TOWER Oh , well  --  when Willie writes his next best-seller , you can . WILLIAM TOWER You put a premium on failure . MILLICENT TOWER And , Gilbert , when you do start disciplining Jane , you might ask her to stop encouraging that awful Peter Crewe to think that my daughter  --  yes , and your daughter , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have never denied my share in Ann 's paternity . Is there something I do n't know ? MILLICENT TOWER It 's easy to laugh . Most convenient . I 'll go up and see what 's happened to Ann . ( To TOWER ) It 's cook 's day off . You might take me out to dinner . p. 69 WILLIAM TOWER I 'll be delighted . ( To GILBERT ) Will you and Jane join us ? GILBERT DABNEY I 'd love to and I 'm sure Jane would , too . We 're going to the opera afterwards . MILLICENT TOWER ( With malice ) And while you 're about it , Gilbert , you might invite Lady St. Earth . I 'm sure she 'd love it . GILBERT DABNEY Please do n't rub it in , Millicent . MILLICENT TOWER I must say , Gilbert , you have the patience of Job  --  and you 're far more attractive . ( She goes upstairs . ) WILLIAM TOWER Congratulations , Gilbert  --  on being more attractive than Job . GILBERT DABNEY Thank you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) It 's very nice to see you again , Mr. Tower . WILLIAM TOWER Thank you . GILBERT DABNEY ( Indicating glass ) How about you ? WILLIAM TOWER No , I think I 'll stick with sherry , if you do n't mind . GILBERT DABNEY Jane and I have never forgotten how sympathetic you were on the day we first burst the bombshell on the family . I must say I was glad you were here that day . p. 70 WILLIAM TOWER So was I. GILBERT DABNEY ( Lifts glass , toasts him ) Cheers ! WILLIAM TOWER Cheers ! ( In this scene TOWER probes GILBERT . He is curious about GILBERT and JANE . GILBERT senses that he is being quizzed , rather enjoys it . ) WILLIAM TOWER May I say GILBERT DABNEY Anything at all . WILLIAM TOWER May I say that I think it is very sensible of you to have married a woman older than yourself ? One of the wisest of men , Benjamin Franklin , advised it . GILBERT DABNEY Did he ? WILLIAM TOWER Yes . He lists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ? WILLIAM TOWER Well , as I remember , he says that making a young wife unhappy is apt to make her bitter , whereas making an older one GILBERT DABNEY Yes ? WILLIAM TOWER Is certain to make her grateful ! Is Jane grateful ? GILBERT DABNEY We 're both grateful . We 're very happy . p. 71 WILLIAM TOWER ( Puts scalpel in a little deeper ) No rift in the lute ? GILBERT DABNEY Not a rift . WILLIAM TOWER You 're luckier than most married people . Well , Gilbert , you have confounded the prophets who said your marriage could n't possibly last . GILBERT DABNEY Only sensible thing I 've ever done . WILLIAM TOWER ( Taking a different tack ) I 've been wondering what it is that Jane 's peculiar gift consists of . GILBERT DABNEY Ca n't be defined . It 's just  --  er  --  Jane WILLIAM TOWER I should like to be a little more precise than that . She is not given , thank heaven , to epigram . Nor does she get off brilliant repartees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DABNEY Well  --  as I say , it 's just WILLIAM TOWER ( Coming in quickly ) Do n't say that again , Gilbert , it 's not scientific . GILBERT DABNEY Sorry . WILLIAM TOWER The explanation is very simple . She just tells the truth . And in our world this is so unusual that people think it 's outrageously funny ! p. 72 GILBERT DABNEY ( With a hint of bitterness ) Jane certainly does n't mind telling the truth . WILLIAM TOWER It was very thoughtless of her , was n't it , to cost you an important commission for the dubious luxury of being honest with Lady St. Earth ? GILBERT DABNEY Yes . You see , in my profession connections are everything . I have become ambitious . In a world of opportunities , I am an opportunist . WILLIAM TOWER You will go far . GILBERT DABNEY I have . I shall go farther . WILLIAM TOWER How very odd it is to encounter a completely happy man . ( Delicately ) In every way ? GILBERT DABNEY ( Knows what he means , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . GILBERT DABNEY I find Jane all-sufficient . She is adorable and amusing . In fact , she is all I could possibly want . WILLIAM TOWER More and more you sound like Benjamin Franklin . GILBERT DABNEY If that is so , then I am prepared to accept your estimate of him as a wise man . ( JANE comes down . It is a new JANE . Her iron-gray hair is cut very short and clustered thickly round ber well-shaped bead in tight curls . She has made no attempt at youth ; she wears very little make-up and her face looks remarkably fresh and clear-skinned . She wears an audacious evening-dress ; on anyone else it would have almost the appearance of fancy-dress ; on JANE it somehow achieves the inevitable simplicity of nature. ) p. 73 JANE FOWLER William ! I had no idea you were back . It is so nice to see you . Oh , I am delighted . WILLIAM TOWER ( Amazed at her transformation ) Jane ! Is this my Jane ? JANE FOWLER Of course it is . We 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Millicent tells me that London regards you as a humorist . Were you a humorist in Liverpool , Jane ? JANE FOWLER Ah , but , William , Liverpool is much more difficult to impress than London . WILLIAM TOWER Why ? JANE FOWLER In Liverpool they are not afraid of being depressed . It is their birthright . But in London they are so eager to laugh that they meet you more than half way . They think just coming from Liverpool is funny ! WILLIAM TOWER Now you mention it , Jane , it has a decided comic aspect . GILBERT DABNEY By the way , Jane , we have to decide about the week-end . We have four invitations already . JANE FOWLER Gilbert can never resist an invitation . GILBERT DABNEY No . I 'd like to accept them all . Here 's one from Lord Duffield . p. 74 JANE FOWLER That 's horses . WILLIAM TOWER ( To JANE ) How do you get on with the horsey set ? JANE FOWLER They 're rather simple . I talk to them about easy books and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants us too . WILLIAM TOWER The effervescent historian . How do you get on with him , Jane ? JANE FOWLER I simply let him bubble . He is dazzled with his own identity . GILBERT DABNEY ( To TOWER ) Anson 's crazy about Jane . He 's dedicating his new book to her . He tells everybody she 's brilliant . JANE FOWLER He thinks me brilliant because I never interrupt him . GILBERT DABNEY ( Flipping another invitation in his hand ) Lord Shillinghurst is most anxious . He 's got a lovely place . Let 's go to him . JANE FOWLER He is a problem . WILLIAM TOWER Why ? JANE FOWLER He is a Labor peer , and he is very self-conscious because he has never been a workingman. p. 75 GILBERT DABNEY By the way , Jane , I 've been around to Belgrave Square today and got a lot of new ideas . I 've been working like mad on the plans . I 'm dying to show you . Why do n't you pick up with Tower where you left off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? JANE FOWLER All right . GILBERT DABNEY When I first saw you two together Tower was on his knees before you . WILLIAM TOWER I still am . JANE FOWLER Thank you , William . GILBERT DABNEY None of that , now . Remember , I am very jealous , very possessive ! ( He goes upstairs . ) JANE FOWLER Well , William ! WILLIAM TOWER Well , Jane ! For a moment I did n't know you . JANE FOWLER I knew you at once . WILLIAM TOWER But I have n't changed my tailor . May I say that your shoulders are beautiful ? JANE FOWLER ( Glancing down at them impersonally ) Was n't it clever of Gilbert to see their possibilities ? WILLIAM TOWER You are unique , and you are radiantly happy . Are n't you ? p. 76 JANE FOWLER I must tell you , William  --  since our last meeting I have read you . Millie has all your books and I have plowed through every one of them . WILLIAM TOWER I do n't care for the expression " plowed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what I meant to convey was that I should n't try to pretend to you because I can see from your books that you understand women too well . WILLIAM TOWER Does that mean that you are going to confess to me ? JANE FOWLER Only partially . One thing I have discovered  --  the young have no conversation . WILLIAM TOWER I have just been talking to Gilbert and he is extremely glib . JANE FOWLER He has no silences . WILLIAM TOWER And yet you seem radiantly happy . JANE FOWLER I am . I 've been enjoying myself no end . It 's very different from my life in Liverpool . WILLIAM TOWER Do I sense a reservation ? Is there a rift in the lute ? JANE FOWLER If there is , it is n't Gilbert 's fault . WILLIAM TOWER Is it yours ? p. 77 JANE FOWLER There is something , you know , William , about the difference in ages . We can learn to speak the language of the young , but we do n't really understand it . WILLIAM TOWER Millicent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FOWLER Peter is more adventurous than Gilbert . WILLIAM TOWER And are you ? JANE FOWLER It seems odd to say it , but I think I am . Gilbert is a dear , but he 's a bit a bit WILLIAM TOWER Well ? JANE FOWLER Old-fashioned . WILLIAM TOWER Why do n't you bring him up to date ? JANE FOWLER He is very set in his ways . But I am so glad you came at this particular moment . I want to talk to you about Ann . WILLIAM TOWER Oh , yes . Millicent takes a poor view of your friendship with Peter . JANE FOWLER I know she does . Yet Ann loves Peter and it will last . I must say I love him , too . And , William , you must get to know him . WILLIAM TOWER Why does n't he break loose and marry Ann ? JANE FOWLER Because he is already married . p. 78 WILLIAM TOWER ( Startled ) What ? JANE FOWLER It was a passport marriage . He married this girl in Austria who was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TOWER Did it work out ? JANE FOWLER No , they caught up with her at the last minute . WILLIAM TOWER Where is this girl now ? JANE FOWLER In a prison camp . I saw her . WILLIAM TOWER How on earth did you manage that ? JANE FOWLER Through Lord Frobisher . He arranged it . It was very kind of him because personally he can not bear me . WILLIAM TOWER But Millicent JANE FOWLER She must n't know . She 'd only get hysterical and that would n't be at all constructive . WILLIAM TOWER What about Ann ? Under these circumstances  --  what possible future has Ann ? JANE FOWLER Ann 's future is with Peter . It is the only future she wants . And if our plans come off WILLIAM TOWER What plans ? p. 79 JANE FOWLER I do n't want to tell you because if they do n't come off you 'd only laugh at me . WILLIAM TOWER I promise you I wo n't do that . ANN TOWER ( Comes running downstairs ) Father ! I 'm so sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old must learn to wait upon the young . You 're looking lovely , darling . JANE FOWLER ( Bluntly ) Ann , I 've told him . ANN TOWER ( A bit scared ) About  --  Peter ? JANE FOWLER Yes . ANN TOWER ( Quite tense ) Well , how did he take it ? JANE FOWLER Not too badly . WILLIAM TOWER Do n't exaggerate , Jane . I 'm not happy about it at all . ANN TOWER Neither am I. But if Peter had n't done what he did , he would n't be Peter . JANE FOWLER Ann , I have a feeling that if you take your father into the garden and have a nice cozy talk with him ANN TOWER Have you softened him up ? p. 80 WILLIAM TOWER I am very much surprised at you , Jane , encouraging my daughter in this extra-marital alliance . ANN TOWER ( To JANE ) Does n't he make it sound sordid ? WILLIAM TOWER That 's exactly what it is , young lady . Even if it is surrounded with a murky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the garden . ) JANE FOWLER ( Goes to the telephone ) Temple Bar 60 double 6 , please . May I speak with Lord Frobisher , please ? This is Mrs. Dabney Is this Lord Frobisher 's secretary ? I was wondering whether Lord Frobisher received my message Oh , he did Oh , he is . Thank you very much . Good-bye . ( She hangs up . GILBERT has come down during the conversation ; he carries a set of blueprints . ) GILBERT DABNEY What do you want with old Allan ? Badgering him about Peter again , to give him a job ? You are far too preoccupied with Peter . Far too much . He is n't worth it . I 'm just dying to show you those plans . Millicent was most enthusiastic about them . JANE FOWLER Was she ? GILBERT DABNEY She said it made her mouth water to think of all the wonderful parties she could give in a house like that . Now come here  --  relax . I 'll take you around from room to room ; you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducted tour . ( GILBERT spreads plan out on floor and gets down on his knees to show her the details ) Oh , Jane , this is going to be a wonderful setting for you . You see this exquisite circular staircase ? p. 81 JANE FOWLER It 's charming . But who will walk up those stairs ? GILBERT DABNEY Crowds . JANE FOWLER An endless succession of what William calls notorious people . GILBERT DABNEY The notoriouser the better ! JANE FOWLER ( Laughs ) And I 'll have to receive them ! GILBERT DABNEY Of course you will ! JANE FOWLER What will I do if , instead of receiving them , I feel a tremendous impulse to say : " Please go home ! " GILBERT DABNEY You 'll say it and they 'll only laugh and walk right in . JANE FOWLER I may disappoint you Gilbert-and them . GILBERT DABNEY What nonsense ! You 're the rage of London . JANE FOWLER What does it mean to be the rage of London ? To amuse mildly a lot of people one does n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any better , whom one does n't , in fact , care very much about . GILBERT DABNEY What difference does all that make , as long as it 's fun ? JANE FOWLER It has been fun . p. 82 GILBERT DABNEY Then what are you quibbling about ? JANE FOWLER It 's the sort of fun that ca n't last forever . GILBERT DABNEY Why not ? JANE FOWLER I 'm not talking only about us , Gilbert . Do n't you know what is threatening England today  --  the world today ? Do n't you read the papers ? GILBERT DABNEY Oh , I read the theatre and society columns once in a while , especially if we 're in it . Also the real-estate transactions . Jane , put this nonsense out of your head and let 's get back to our house . It 's going to be a dream ! JANE FOWLER What shall we do in our house ? GILBERT DABNEY Well , what does anyone do in a house ? Live in it ! Entertain ! We 'll give such wonderful dinner parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll be so chic that the arrivistes wo n't feel they 've " arreeved " till we 've " inveeted " them . ( Chuckles at his joke . ) JANE FOWLER Gilbert ! Can it be that you 're a bit of a snob ? GILBERT DABNEY ( Astonished that she should ask ) But of course I am . What else is there to be ? I mean , who is n't ? p. 83 JANE FOWLER Peter is n't . GILBERT DABNEY I 'm perfectly sure he is . In his own grubby circle , I 'm certain he is . Every class has its snobs . It 's just a question of scale . JANE FOWLER So all this is enough for you ? GILBERT DABNEY Superabundant . JANE FOWLER Do n't you think it 's possible that one day you will want more ? GILBERT DABNEY Why not cross that bridge when we come to it ? JANE FOWLER Would that be quite fair to me ? GILBERT DABNEY Fair ? JANE FOWLER When the day of bridge-crossing comes you will have most of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to outstay my welcome . It 's a good Liverpool rule of life . GILBERT DABNEY Look  --  what is all this about ? JANE FOWLER I do n't want to go on with the plans for our house , Gilbert . I 've thought better of it . GILBERT DABNEY You 're not serious ? JANE FOWLER Yes , I am perfectly serious . GILBERT DABNEY But , Jane p. 84 JANE FOWLER I must tell you , Gilbert . You are very ingenious , but not even you can demolish time nor the necessities of age . I always used to tell Millie she did too much . And now it 's I who am doing too much . When I look at those plans of which you 're so proud  --  when I think of the endless succession of dinner parties and supper parties that you are so eagerly anticipating  --  it 's then I think longingly of those evenings in Liverpool , when I sat before my fire in my dressing gown and slippers and read Jane Austen over and over again . GILBERT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up then ? JANE FOWLER ( Sighs ) Yes . GILBERT DABNEY This is the second commission you have cost me today ! JANE FOWLER The second ? GILBERT DABNEY Did you also have to ruin me with Lady St. Earth ? JANE FOWLER Have I ? GILBERT DABNEY You know very well you have . I was to get a handsome commission from her and that stupid remark you made about Anthony Eden killed it ! JANE FOWLER I 'm sorry . GILBERT DABNEY Did you have to go out of your way to insult her ? p. 85 JANE FOWLER I did not go out of my way . She made a silly remark about a brave man who had just done a very courageous thing . I told her I did not share her point of view , that 's all . GILBERT DABNEY ( Very hard ) Well , it cost me a commission ! JANE FOWLER I 'm so sorry . I had no idea . I 'll make it up to you somehow . GILBERT DABNEY ( His voice rises ) I am perfectly aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I married for money . Well , this commission from Lady St. Earth , which incidentally would have led to others , would have made me independent of you financially . JANE FOWLER What alternative had I ? GILBERT DABNEY The alternative of keeping quiet . JANE FOWLER Am I to suppress everything I feel for fear of offending those who might offer you commissions ? That 's a pretty strict censorship . Do you care to exercise it ? GILBERT DABNEY There are other topics . Ca n't you discuss them ? JANE FOWLER Just now in England  --  there are no other topics . GILBERT DABNEY Then you might maintain a distinguished silence ! p. 86 JANE FOWLER That 's odd . When we first met , my directness-as you called it-seemed to amuse you . It amuses you less , I see . GILBERT DABNEY The trouble with you , Jane , is you 've never outgrown the mentality of Liverpool . This is London . Why ca n't you take your cue from Millicent ? She amuses people without antagonizing them . JANE FOWLER Millie is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a larger circulation . WILSON ( Comes in and announces ) Lord Frobisher ! JANE FOWLER ( Gets up to greet LORD FROBISHER ) Allan ! LORD ALLAN FROBISHER Jane ! JANE FOWLER How nice of you to come so quickly ! GILBERT DABNEY Shall I find Millicent for you ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER I came to see your wife , as a matter of fact . Had to tear myself away from a cocktail party , where I was having a very good time . But when I make a date I keep it . JANE FOWLER You 're a very kind man . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER That 's a base libel . WILLIAM TOWER ( Comes in from the garden ) Allan ! p. 87 LORD ALLAN FROBISHER Hello , Willie ! Back again ? WILLIAM TOWER How 's the elderly adolescent ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER What a memory you have , Willie-for the wrong things ! And what a lucky fellow you are ! We stick here in London undergoing crisis after crisis , while you wander over the world having adventures ! And getting jolly well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ? GILBERT DABNEY He did his laundry in the Ganges . WILLIAM TOWER As a matter of fact , I did have an adventure in India . A profound adventure . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER Who was she ? WILLIAM TOWER You woud n't in the least understand it , Allan . It was entirely spiritual . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER When anybody talks to me about " spiritual adventures , " I always think : " What woman have they been turned down by ? " WILLIAM TOWER ( To JANE ) Is n't he gross ? JANE FOWLER ( Smiles warmly at FROBISHER ) His bark is worse than his bite . WILLIAM TOWER I adore you , Jane . You embrace a clich with the headlong passion of first love . p. 88 JANE FOWLER ( Unperturbed ) So often a clich expresses exactly what I mean . Why strive for something new ? WILLIAM TOWER How 's your asthma , Allan ? ( Explains to JANE ) Allan always has asthma . JANE FOWLER ( To FROBISHER ) I have a most wonderful cure for it . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent to you . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER Thank you very much . JANE FOWLER As a matter of fact , I think I might have it upstairs . My dear Harry suffered from asthma and we found this formula worked wonders . Gilbert , would you mind going upstairs and looking for it ? GILBERT DABNEY No , not if you can give me some idea , however vague , where it is . JANE FOWLER I think it 's in that morocco case . GILBERT DABNEY That morocco case is as big as a vault , but I 'll try . ( He goes upstairs . ) JANE FOWLER Thank you . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( Hypochondriac ) What did your husband die of , Jane ? p. 89 JANE FOWLER ( Placidly ) Asthma . ( TOWER laughs . ) LORD ALLAN FROBISHER Says a lot for the remedy , does n't it ? WILLIAM TOWER You know , Jane , I 've known Allan for nearly thirty years . And he does n't seem to change a bit . I find it extremely irritating . How do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two devotions  --  my body and women . I pay infinite attention to the requirements of both . WILLIAM TOWER Often , I imagine , simultaneously ! ( To JANE ) Do n't you think it 's shocking , Jane , for an old man like Allan to go on like that ? JANE FOWLER ( Smiles at FROBISHER ) I do n't get an impression of age from Allan at all . WILLIAM TOWER Do you know how old he is ? JANE FOWLER I never think about people 's ages . They either seem young or old to me . WILLIAM TOWER How do I seem to you ? JANE FOWLER Timeless . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER I believe that if the will to live is strong enough it can surmount anything  --  even your asthma cure , Jane . I feel immortal . ( He coughs. ) p. 90 WILLIAM TOWER When you say that , Allan , do n't cough . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER One thing I got from the English  --  the cult of sport . WILLIAM TOWER You got a good deal more than that  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I earned the one and paid for the other . WILLIAM TOWER There 's a lot to be said for living as you do , Allan . In youth one 's body is the perfect valet  --  obedient , unobtrusive , instantly responsive , a perpetual source of gratification . But at our age one becomes conscious of playing a cat-and-mouse game with it . You have constantly to outwit it . It becomes your enemy . It lies in ambush for you . You dodge , you seek cover , in books , in music , in fantasy , in alcohol . But you always know it 's there , constantly sniping at you . And one day , any minute in fact , the invisible marksman will get you . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER Well , my body is still my valet . WILSON ( Enters , announces ) Mr. Crewe . JANE FOWLER Oh , Peter . You remember Mr. Tower , do n't you ? PETER CREWE Yes , of course . WILLIAM TOWER Nice to see you again . ( They shake hands. ) p. 91 JANE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you do , sir ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER This the young feller you spoke to me about , Jane ? JANE FOWLER Yes . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER I 've read some of your things , my boy , in those bloody Socialist papers . You would n't do for me at all . PETER CREWE ( As if it were the ultimate compliment ) Thank you very much , sir . WILLIAM TOWER ( Delighted ) Yes , you 're quite right to take that as a compliment , Peter . PETER CREWE I do appreciate your efforts in my behalf , Jane . But actually the last thing I want to do is to work for Lord Frobisher . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( Piqued ) Why not ? PETER CREWE I have read your editorials , sir , and I find that you have an unerring instinct for the wrong conclusions . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( To JANE ) I am quite familiar with this form of attack . He thinks it will provoke me into hiring him . He 's mistaken . p. 92 PETER CREWE ( To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the garden . PETER CREWE Thank you , Jane . Excuse me , please . ( He goes out to the garden . ) LORD ALLAN FROBISHER Insufferable brat ! WILLIAM TOWER But I think he is sincere . I really believe he would n't work for you , Allan  --  which does indicate a kind of taste . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER One day , Willier , your voglie will end and no one will buy your books or produce your plays . It happens to all you fellows . Then you 'll be glad to come to me for a job . WILLIAM TOWER Then I 'll be glad to ask you for one . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER And then I 'll refuse . WILLIAM TOWER Then I shall burst into tears . JANE FOWLER And now , William , you can go away . WILLIAM TOWER Dear Jane , you are so indirect . You must be awfully anxious to be alone with Allan . JANE FOWLER I am . I adore Allan . WILLIAM TOWER I do n't know what it is that Jane wants , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on guard ! If you find yourself in a tight corner , one sharp , piercing scream will bring me in from the garden . ( He goes out. ) p. 93 JANE FOWLER ( After a moment , to break the ice ) Have you noticed about William 's books ? They have everything in them but joie de vivre . They have wit , they have wisdom , they have pity even , but no joy in just living . Have you noticed that ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER Do n't read him . JANE FOWLER Really ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER He writes far too much and I 'm too damn busy . JANE FOWLER I think he 's quite an unhappy man . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER I say , do you mind if I pour myself another drink ? JANE FOWLER Of course not . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER Thank you . JANE FOWLER Allan , the more I get to know you the more I realize how little people deserve their reputations . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER Why do you say that ? What 's my reputation ? JANE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I enjoy it . JANE FOWLER I know you enjoy it , but you do n't deserve it . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER Do n't butter me up . I see through it and I do n't like it . Now tell me what it is you want and let me go . I 've got a date . p. 94 JANE FOWLER You always have a date . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER I hope you do n't mind . JANE FOWLER Not a bit , but it amazes me how in your long life you 've avoided matrimony . How have you done it ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER Really do n't know how , to tell you the truth . Somehow all the women I 've ever been attracted to were already married  --  or else they were actresses . JANE FOWLER Two interesting groups ! Why does a man like you take pride in so many conquests ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( Tries to answer honestly ) Well  --  one wants constantly the assurance that one is still attractive . JANE FOWLER There must be another reason . The quantity test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? JANE FOWLER It must be easier to conquer many than to constantly reconquer one . There , one can not rely on novelty . It 's much more of a test , do n't you think ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER Perhaps too much of one ! ( Drinks . ) JANE FOWLER ( With finality ) There 's no doubt about it . Men are lazy ! p. 95 LORD ALLAN FROBISHER Lazy ? I go to a lot of trouble just to be lazy ! JANE FOWLER ( Involuntarily ) Poor Allan ! LORD ALLAN FROBISHER Why do you say that ? JANE FOWLER I find it very touching  --  that you have never been loved . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( Irritated ) I do very well . All the girls I want . JANE FOWLER ( Mildly ) I suppose the girls do very well , too . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( Nettled to a degree ) I find you extremely irritating . I want another drink . JANE FOWLER Do you think it 's good for you , at your age , to drink so much ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiff one ) Whether it 's good for me or not , I 'm going to do it ! JANE FOWLER Oh , dear ! I seem to have antagonized you ! And I did so want you in a friendly mood . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER You have n't got the knack . Tell me what it is you want and let me go . ( Looks at his wrist watch ) I 'm late now . But I warn you in advance  --  whatever it is  --  I am unlikely to grant it . The plain truth is , Jane  --  I do n't particularly care for you . p. 96 JANE FOWLER I know you do n't . That is why it was so kind of you to help me the first time . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( His curiosity gets the better of him ) What on earth did you want to visit that prison camp for , anyway ? JANE FOWLER A friend of mine is in it . And now , Allan , I want you to do more . I want you to get her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chore . JANE FOWLER Of course it 's a chore . That 's why I 've come to you . You 're the only man in England I know who has the energy , the connections and the power to do it . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( Flattered ) Is she pretty ? ( JANE laughs ) Somehow it 's easier to do things for a woman if she 's attractive ! JANE FOWLER She is attractive . In fact , she meets all your requirements in a woman . She 's lovely , she 's an actress and she 's married . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER To whom ? JANE FOWLER I 'll tell you , but I do n't want it to go any further . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER Naturally . ( Drinks. ) p. 97 JANE FOWLER She is married to the young man I just introduced you to  --  Peter Crewe . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER I thought he was Ann 's beau . JANE FOWLER He is . He was never in love with this girl . Now they both want a divorce so they may go their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her out . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( Mulling it over ) There are instances where it 's been done . Those mighty Herrenvolk are corrupt as hell . Might cost you a bit of money ! JANE FOWLER I am ready to supply all it will cost . It will be so wonderful of you to do this for me  --  especially as you do n't like me very much . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER You 're pretty cool ! JANE FOWLER ( Smiles at him bewitchingly ) At our age we should be cool , do n't you think ? I mean  --  if not at our age  --  when ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( Backs away ; in a kind of rage of despair ) Damn it all , Jane , you 're the only woman I know who makes me feel I 'm on my last legs ! JANE FOWLER Nonsense ! You 're in an excellent state of preservation . p. 98 LORD ALLAN FROBISHER My God ! ( Makes for liquor table again . ) JANE FOWLER I do wish you would n't drink so much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill yourself with drink . I know all about your condition . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( Pitifully ) My condition was wonderful  --  till I came here ! JANE FOWLER You forget about your asthma . My dear Harry had it and he never touched a drop . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( With desperate defiance ) Your dear Harry died and I do n't intend to die ! JANE FOWLER We 're all mortal . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( Turns on her in homicidal rage ) I wish you to know that I came here bounding with vitality , full of the joy of life . Now , thanks to you , I feel something like rigor mortis ! ( He sinks down on the settee , afflicted by a morbid hypochondria . ) JANE FOWLER I did n't mean to be depressing . It 's just that I do think at our age we ought to be careful . There 's no reason why you should n't live to be a hundred . Unless , of course p. 99 LORD ALLAN FROBISHER Unless what ? JANE FOWLER Unless you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laziness . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( Completely sunk and a bit maudlin , pleading ) Jane . JANE FOWLER ( Brightly ) Yes , dear ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER Jane , would you do something for me ? JANE FOWLER ( Co-operative ) Oh , anything LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( Sepulchral ) Would you take charge of my funeral arrangements ? JANE FOWLER ( Laughing ) Oh , that 's a long way off . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER I 'm sure you 'll do it admirably . Admirably . JANE FOWLER Certainly , if you will undertake to do the same for me . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER What the devil are you laughing at ? JANE FOWLER I was just thinking  --  if that regrettable event did occur  --  what I 'd put on your tombstone . p. 100 LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( Mutters wildly ) Still at it  --  writing my epitaph ! Well , let 's have it . What is it ? JANE FOWLER Here lies Allan , Lord Frobisher . Died of acute  --  laziness . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( Continues shouting ) And a good way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't ask for better . JANE FOWLER You 're the most determined rake I ever met . It must be very exhausting . And I 'm not at all sure it 's good for your asthma . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER I wish you to know , Mrs. Dabney I wish you to know that I 'll go on living as I have been living . Do you mind ? I 'm far too old to change . JANE FOWLER Are you as old as all that ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( At bay ) Yes , I am ! JANE FOWLER I 'd hate to be too old to change . Look at me . Look how I 've changed . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER I wo n't do it . I will not do it ! JANE FOWLER What ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER What you asked me . I could do it , probably , if I put myself out . But I wo n't . And do you know why I wo n't ? Because you asked me . I wo n't do a damn thing about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Your kind heart will make yo  --  when you are sober . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( Thrashing about ) And do n't you write me any more letters . The next letter you write me I 'm going to throw right in the waste-paper basket . JANE FOWLER This one good deed which you are going to do may be the most comforting thing in your life to look back on  --  your immortality . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER I do n't give a good God damn for immortality ! JANE FOWLER Do n't be blasphemous . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER Not a damn . I live for the moment , do you hear ? I do n't give a hoot what comes after me . I sha n't be here to see it . You can decide in your calm way whether you 'll have azaleas or calla lillies at your funeral . But I do n't give a damn ! At my funeral they can have ragweed for all I care . Let them bloody well sneeze their heads off ! WILLIAM TOWER ( Comes in from garden ) Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your newspapers ! You 're frightening the birds in the garden . They 're all atwitter ! JANE FOWLER ( Apologizes for him ) Allan has had one too many ! p. 102 WILLIAM TOWER What outrageous demand have you made on him , Jane ? And  --  I am curious to know  --  did you get it ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER She did not get it ! She will never get it ! MILLICENT TOWER ( Comes down in full evening dress ) Allan ! How nice to see you ! No one told me you were here . WILLIAM TOWER ( With malice ) Allan did n't come to see you , Millicent . He came to see Jane ! MILLICENT TOWER ( Annoyed ) I hope I 'm not in the way . JANE FOWLER He came to see me on business . MILLICENT TOWER Business ? What business could you possibly have with Allan ? ( To FROBISHER ) What 's the matter , Allan ? You look rather down in the mouth . WILLIAM TOWER Allan is swimming in alcoholic melancholy . Did you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wanted ? JANE FOWLER Allan is a very good man ! LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( Clinging to his villainy for dear life ) I am not a good man ! I am a bad man ! p. 103 JANE FOWLER I know better . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER Jane , this is my last word to you . If you think you 're going to make a do-gooder out of me you are very much mistaken . I 'm getting no girls out of prison camps  --  ( JANE is aghast ) and especially not for you ! MILLICENT TOWER Allan , what are you saying ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( Points to garden ) That young bounder 's wife MILLICENT TOWER What do you mean ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER Your daughter 's beau . He 's got a Czech wife in a prison camp and Jane 's moving heaven and earth to get her out ! ( Confronts JANE ) Well , I wo n't get her out . If that young whippersnapper wants her out , why does n't he do it himself ? Why does n't he storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want her out . This is my last word to you , Mrs. Dabney ! Good day ! ( He strides to the hall . When he gets there he meets GILBERT , who has come down with the prescription in his hand . ) GILBERT DABNEY Here you are , Allan . I 've found dear Harry 's prescription . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER I no longer need it . Your dear wife has already buried me without it . ( He points to an imaginary plot of ground and is consumed by alcoholic pity as he contemplates his gravestone ) I 'm lying there-right beside Harry ! ( He goes out. ) p. 104 MILLICENT TOWER ( Recovering her senses ) What did he say ? What did he say , Willie ? Did he say wife ? WILLIAM TOWER He certainly said wife . MILLICENT TOWER My God ! Peter is a bigamist . That 's why he would n't ask Ann to marry him ! Because he is a bigamist ! WILLIAM TOWER My dear Millicent , if he were a bigamist he would have asked Ann to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane , you knew it all the time . JANE FOWLER Yes . I 'm afraid I did . MILLICENT TOWER I always knew there was something wrong with that young man  --  right from the beginning . Who knows how many wives he 's got ? And this one a jailbird , too ! Where is he ? Let me just Where is he ? WILLIAM TOWER In the garden with Ann . MILLICENT TOWER A cad like that has the effrontery to be in my garden ! WILLIAM TOWER My dear Millicent , if you 're going to start a campaign to eliminate cads from gardens , you will have your hands full . JANE FOWLER Millie , dear p. 105 MILLICENT TOWER Do n't call me that ! I see a lot of things now your insulting my best friends your peculiar ways I 've had about as much as I can stand . You are my guest JANE FOWLER I am more than your guest . I am your sister-in-law ! MILLICENT TOWER That 's not enough ! ( Turns to GILBERT ) Gilbert ! Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! GILBERT DABNEY I must say , Jane , that I 'm entirely on Millicent 's side . JANE FOWLER Yes , I know you are . GILBERT DABNEY Moreover , I 'm in no mood for the opera . I simply could n't cope with all those Rhine maidens tonight ! ( To TOWER ) You know , Mr. Tower , I 'm beginning to think that your friend Benjamin Franklin is vastly over-rated . WILLIAM TOWER Why ? GILBERT DABNEY He said  --  they 'd be grateful . My God ! Grateful ! ( He goes upstairs in a pet . ) MILLICENT TOWER What did he mean by that ? Is Mr. Franklin building a house , too ? WILLIAM TOWER Not this season , Millicent ! p. 106 JANE FOWLER Millie , dear , I know that you 're very angry with me . MILLICENT TOWER That 's putting it mildly . JANE FOWLER But I 'm going to ask you to do something for me . I know Gilbert has set his heart on going to the opera . It 's an opening night and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you make him go with you ? You 're looking so lovely and you 'll see all your friends in the intermission . And when Gilbert comes home he will have forgotten how upset he is with me . MILLICENT TOWER You do n't deserve it ! ( Abruptly ) Where are the tickets ? JANE FOWLER Here . ( She gives them to her . ) MILLICENT TOWER I do n't know why I 'm sacrificing myself for you . JANE FOWLER Because you 're an angel . MILLICENT TOWER I suppose that must be it . I must confess , Mr. Richard Wagner gives me the fidgets-but the intermissions are rather fun . ( With a twinge of martyrdom ) Still  --  think what you have to go through to get to them ! ( She goes upstairs . ) WILLIAM TOWER Millicent seems to have completely forgotten that she was to dine with me . May I take you to dinner , Jane ? p. 107 JANE FOWLER That would be lovely . I 'm very hungry . WILLIAM TOWER To borrow your favorite word-it will be cozy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off stage ) All right , Wilson , you need n't announce me . ( He is back again . ) JANE FOWLER Why , Allan  --  what have you come back for ? I thought you had a date . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER I did . Thanks to you I 've missed it . You not only ruined my afternoon  --  you 've ruined my evening ! Willie , I 'd even go to dinner with you ! WILLIAM TOWER I 've asked Jane to go to dinner with me . Wo n't you join us ? ( Ca n't resist the final barb ) With you around , Jane will appreciate me all the more . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( Defiantly ) I 'll take my chances ! JANE FOWLER ( As she looks from one to the other ) Oh , it will be such a relief for once WILLIAM TOWER What ? JANE FOWLER ( As the two men flank her she links her arms through theirs ) To spend an evening with two men of my own age ! They start off gaily as the curtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wearing glasses , is propped up on pillows on the settee reading PETER 'S poems . TOWER comes in . WILLIAM TOWER Forgive me for disturbing you , Jane . JANE FOWLER You do n't disturb me in the least . I 'm just reading Peter 's poems . Have you read them ? WILLIAM TOWER Yes , I have . JANE FOWLER What do you think of them ? WILLIAM TOWER One day he will write excellent prose . JANE FOWLER I must say they 're a bit over my head . They 're so full of Greek and Latin phrases . How many languages that boy knows ! WILLIAM TOWER Eventually he may even conquer English . JANE FOWLER Now William , you must n't be bitter . He 's going to be your son-in-law . WILLIAM TOWER It is that I came to see you about , Jane . JANE FOWLER ( Sits up ) I ca n't see too much of you , William . You always give me a fresh point of view . p. 109 WILLIAM TOWER I 'm afraid that the point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventional , in fact . I find that as a father , I am conventional . JANE FOWLER Oh , you come as a father ? WILLIAM TOWER Yes . As a father , I feel about the same as any other father . I want Ann to make a reasonably good marriage . JANE FOWLER I feel sure that Peter has a future . WILLIAM TOWER Perhaps . It is his present that worries me . You 're a practical woman , and you know as well as I do that there are very few calamities in life in which the possession of money is not a mitigation . JANE FOWLER I believe in Peter . If one ca n't believe in the possibilities of human nature , what can one believe in ? WILLIAM TOWER I am a skeptic , not a believer . JANE FOWLER The more I get to know you , the more I understand why in your stories the wives are always murdering the husbands . WILLIAM TOWER You do me an injustice . Often the husbands murder the wives . But to return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time , I appeal to you to help get her out of this impossible situation . p. 110 JANE FOWLER I do n't think it is an impossible situation . WILLIAM TOWER Is n't it obvious that so long as Peter 's wife remains in a prison camp there can be no possible future for Ann ? JANE FOWLER I 'm taking steps to get her out . WILLIAM TOWER And what if she does get out ? What happens then ? JANE FOWLER ( After a moment ) I am going to adopt Peter 's wife . WILLIAM TOWER ( Stares at her ) Adopt her ? Why ? JANE FOWLER For one thing , it will make it easier for her to stay in this country . And for another , I have n't any children of my own . So why should n't I ? WILLIAM TOWER Good God ! Wo n't that make Ann 's position even more anomalous ? JANE FOWLER Peter will get a divorce . WILLIAM TOWER ( Testily ) You are a really determined matchmaker , are n't you ? JANE FOWLER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILLIAM TOWER ( After a moment 's reflection ) But Gilbert ? How will Gilbert enjoy all this , do you think ? p. 111 JANE FOWLER I do n't know . I have n't told him yet . WILLIAM TOWER If I know Gilbert he wo n't care for it one bit . You might lose him . JANE FOWLER ( Tranquilly ) I have anticipated that also ( TOWER is extremely interested in this ) Gilbert is bound to leave me sooner or later . I never expected this to last forever . WILLIAM TOWER ( With quick revelation ) So that 's the way the land lies ! I see ! JANE FOWLER What do you see ? WILLIAM TOWER It 's happened already , has it ? JANE FOWLER What ? WILLIAM TOWER Gilbert is leaving you . JANE FOWLER ( Quite content with this interpretation ) Millie always predicted it , did n't she ? WILLIAM TOWER Poor Jane ! My sympathy ! JANE FOWLER Thank you , William . WILLIAM TOWER What will Gilbert do ? JANE FOWLER I hope he will marry again  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy . p. 112 WILLIAM TOWER It seems to me you are amazingly calm about it ! JANE FOWLER Since it 's inevitable , why fret ? WILLIAM TOWER You appear to be an extraordinary mixture , Jane , of the Oracle of Delphi and Dale Carnegie . WILSON ( Comes in ) Excuse me , madam . Mr. Peter Crewe on the telephone for you . JANE FOWLER Thank you , Wilson , I 'll speak to him from my room . ( As she goes to stairs ) You 're not going right away , are you , William ? WILLIAM TOWER No , I want to see Ann . JANE FOWLER ( From stair landing ) Good . I do so enjoy talking to you ! I know dimly who the Oracle of Delphi was-but Dale Carnegie Was n't he an American who spawned libraries and did n't he hate books ? ( She goes up . ) MILLICENT TOWER ( Comes in from library ) Well , Willie  --  did you get anywhere with her ? WILLIAM TOWER I 'm afraid not . MILLICENT TOWER ( Bursting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible for this whole wretched affair . She 's got Ann under her spell . And what infuriates me to madness is that she acts as if everything were milk and honey between us . I have n't spoken to her for weeks . But she pays no attention . She 's got no pride . I never met a woman with so little pride . p. 113 WILLIAM TOWER ( Ca n't resist having a little fun ) Still , Millicent , I have a bit of news that may interest you . MILLICENT TOWER ( Long-suffering ) It ca n't be good news and I ca n't stand any more bad news . What is it ? WILLIAM TOWER It 's about Jane and Gilbert . MILLICENT TOWER ( Avid ) What about Jane and Gilbert ? WILLIAM TOWER ( Doling it out slowly ) Your prediction has come true , I 'm afraid . MILLICENT TOWER ( Quivering with joyful anticipation ) What prediction ? You mean that Gilbert will Now do n't tantalize me , Willie ! What is it ? WILLIAM TOWER ( Crisply ) Gilbert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) No ! Willie ! No ! WILLIAM TOWER ( With Mephistophelian glee ) Yes ! Sad , is n't it ? MILLICENT TOWER ( Ecstatic ) It 's happened ! It 's happened at last ! p. 114 WILLIAM TOWER Do n't be so depressed about it . MILLICENT TOWER Did she tell you ? WILLIAM TOWER I nudged it out of her . MILLICENT TOWER ( A freshet of joy ) What did I tell you , Willie ? It was inevitable  --  I said so from the beginning . And now it 's happened ! It 's happened at last ! WILLIAM TOWER Always pleasant to have a prophecy fulfilled , is n't it ? MILLICENT TOWER ( Now feels she can be generous ) Poor Jane ! She 'll be heartbroken ! Is she heartbroken ? WILLIAM TOWER I did n't make an anatomical examination , but superficially she appears to take it quite philosophically . MILLICENT TOWER ( Dramatizing to the hilt ) Abandoned ! Abandoned at her age ! You must be very nice to her . WILLIAM TOWER I shall lift gallantry to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) But for who , Willie ? Jane  --  for who ? WILLIAM TOWER Millicent , your melancholy is playing havoc with your syntax . p. 115 MILLICENT TOWER You know perfectly well what I mean . Obviously Gilbert is leaving Jane for somebody  --  but for who ? WILLIAM TOWER Jane did n't tell me . MILLICENT TOWER ( Aggrieved ) Did n't you pump her ? WILLIAM TOWER I did n't wish to compound her grief . MILLICENT TOWER ( The crusade of her life ) I 'll find out . Leave it to me . I 'll find out . WILLIAM TOWER I leave it to you with confidence . MILLICENT TOWER If she wo n't tell me , Gilbert will . ( GILBERT is coming down the stairs ) I 'll find out from Gilbert I 'll ( GILBERT comes in , headlong in flight . MRS . TOWER is forced to stop abruptly ) Oh  --  Gilbert ! GILBERT DABNEY Hello , Millicent . Delighted to hear my name in your conversation . MILLICENT TOWER ( Brimming with consolation ) Dear Gilbert ! GILBERT DABNEY What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't been bereaved  --  not that I know of . p. 116 MILLICENT TOWER Dear Gilbert ! GILBERT DABNEY ( Mystified ) I say ! Is somebody dead ? Anyone I know ? WILLIAM TOWER ( Mischievous ; determined to exploit the possibilites of the situation ) On the contrary , Gilbert , far from anyone 's having died , someone is about to come to life . My congratulations ! GILBERT DABNEY On what ? WILLIAM TOWER On the forthcoming addition to your family ! GILBERT DABNEY What ? MILLICENT TOWER ( Transfixed with horror ) What did you say , Willie ? WILLIAM TOWER ( Casually ) Just what I said , Millicent . There is to be an addition to Jane and Gilbert 's family . GILBERT DABNEY What do you mean ? MILLICENT TOWER How do you know ? WILLIAM TOWER Jane just announced it . MILLICENT TOWER ( Shrieks ) It 's a trick ! It 's a contemptible trick  --  to hold you , Gilbert . p. 117 GILBERT DABNEY What on earth are you talking about ? MILLICENT TOWER Is n't that just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now she 's desperate ! At her age ! Gilbert , how could you ! GILBERT DABNEY This is very odd , you know MILLICENT TOWER It 's madness ! At her age ! She 'll never survive ! You should have thought of that , Gilbert . Do you mean to say you did n't know ? GILBERT DABNEY I did n't and I still do n't . WILLIAM TOWER ( Solemnly ) You soon will , Gilbert . Jane is going to tell you . MILLICENT TOWER Obviously you ca n't leave her now . You 're sunk ! GILBERT DABNEY ( Confronts TOWER ) Willie , did Jane tell you that I was going to leave her ? WILLIAM TOWER She did . MILLICENT TOWER If there 's one thing in the world I despise , it 's a woman who has a baby in order to hold a man . WILLIAM TOWER ( Wickedly ) It did n't succeed when you tried it , Millicent , but perhaps it will with Jane . p. 118 MILLICENT TOWER Willie ! Did Jane tell you this or did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is one thing Jane does n't do it 's lie . MILLICENT TOWER There you are , Gilbert . What about it ? GILBERT DABNEY It 's absurd ! Jane knows my views on the subject of babies . I 'm a Malthusian and babies are wasted on me . MILLICENT TOWER Ca n't a Malthusian have a baby ? What 's a Malthusian anyway ? GILBERT DABNEY I believe that the human race invariably does the wrong thing and therefore I do not believe in adding to its numbers . There are far too many people in the world now . MILLICENT TOWER There 's going to be one more ! GILBERT DABNEY Willie , have you been pulling Millicent 's leg ? WILLIAM TOWER In the interest of accuracy  --  Jane did tell me there was to be an addition to your family . But she did not say that she meant to provide that addition personally . She means to adopt it . MILLICENT TOWER ( Her head swimming ) Adopt ! GILBERT DABNEY Adopt ? p. 119 WILLIAM TOWER Adopt . GILBERT DABNEY Who ? MILLICENT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to answer first ? GILBERT DABNEY Who ? WILLIAM TOWER ( Simply ) Peter 's wife . GILBERT DABNEY ( Sees the whole thing now ) Of course  --  Peter 's wife . MILLICENT TOWER Peter 's wife ? MAID ( Comes down stairs ) Excuse me , sir , Miss Ann would like to know if you can go upstairs to see her for a minute . WILLIAM TOWER Certainly . ( As he goes  --  to GILBERT ) I 'll say this for Jane  --  with you for a husband and a girl of about your age for a daughter , you 'll make a most engaging family group . ( He goes upstairs . ) MILLICENT TOWER ( Wastes no time ) Are you going to stand for this , Gilbert ? GILBERT DABNEY I never heard anything so high-handed ! To fasten this grubby girl on me along with everything else p. 120 MILLICENT TOWER Then why do you stand for it ? GILBERT DABNEY This time Jane has gone a bit too far ! MILLICENT TOWER Gilbert , do n't you think you ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TOWER That you and Jane do n't speak the same language . She 'll never belong to our world . Never ! She 's a foreigner ! GILBERT DABNEY I 'm beginning to realize that . As a matter of fact , I knew it all the time but I never let myself face it . Still  --  if I do leave Jane it will give me a feeling of being left rather high and dry . MILLICENT TOWER Nonsense ! You have all the attributes of success . Great success ! You 're young and attractive and clever . You 're an artist . GILBERT DABNEY You are so kind . You are the kindest woman in the world . MILLICENT TOWER It is n't kindness to do things for someone one 's fond of  --  for someone as beguiling as you . You know there has always been an unexpressed sympathy and warmth between us . GILBERT DABNEY ( Who begins to see a new haven ) That night we went to the opera  --  was n't it fun ? p. 121 MILLICENT TOWER Heaven ! I enjoyed myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . That 's what I say ; we speak the same language . Why , even Allan , he 's not GILBERT DABNEY I thought you adored Allan . MILLICENT TOWER I used to , but he 's just a habit  --  a crude habit . Now , you  --  you 're sensitive . I love sensitive people . They make me blossom . GILBERT DABNEY Dear Millicent MILLICENT TOWER You will be the most welcome guest in this house . And I 'll see that you get all the commissions you want . I see no reason why you should n't design my dresses for me  --  for as long as Willie can afford to pay for them . ( She laughs at her own wit ) But there  --  I expect Jane will get you back no matter what I say . GILBERT DABNEY Not this time , she wo n't . I promise you , Millicent . MILLICENT TOWER Oh , yes , she will . She 'll twist you around her meddlesome little finger . ( JANE is coming downstairs unseen by them ) She 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and harps JANE FOWLER ( As she comes in ) Why , Millie  --  you make me sound like a little symphony ! p. 122 MILLICENT TOWER ( Turns and sees her ) Dear Jane JANE FOWLER Dear Millie MILLICENT TOWER Oh , Jane ! My heart goes out to you ! JANE FOWLER Does it ? Why ? MILLICENT TOWER I do n't really know why , but it does . I can understand people being shocked by the unexpected  --  but why when it 's inevitable ? But do n't say I did n't warn you . Thank God , my conscience is clear ! ( She goes upstairs . ) JANE FOWLER ( To GILBERT ) What have you been telling Millie ? GILBERT DABNEY I have n't been doing the talking . You have . JANE FOWLER I have ? GILBERT DABNEY Yes , to Willie . About this crazy idea of yours to adopt Peter 's wife . Are you serious about it ? JANE FOWLER Perfectly serious . GILBERT DABNEY It seems to be your fixed determination to make me ridiculous . JANE FOWLER Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age . Wo n't it seem a bit odd ? p. 123 JANE FOWLER If I can stand it  --  you can . GILBERT DABNEY Look here , Jane , when I married you I thought you were sensible . I had no idea your head was full of sentimental , outmoded ideas . JANE FOWLER Such as ? GILBERT DABNEY Such as that idotic journey you took on our honeymoon . Suppose you do get that dreary girl out ? There will be millions left . Are you going to adopt all of them ? JANE FOWLER ( Quietly ) One does what one can . GILBERT DABNEY The drug of altruism . Very satisfying to the ego . JANE FOWLER ( Studying him anew ) You 're hard , are n't you ? GILBERT DABNEY I 'm realistic and not sentimental . JANE FOWLER You 're selfish , are n't you ? GILBERT DABNEY That word is also ridden with sentimentality . Of course I 'm selfish . Everybody is selfish . It 's a contradiction in terms to say that one is not selfish . Look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one 's self . Well , one 's self is all one has and all one knows . Can one get out of one 's self ? Only by dying . The use of the word as a term of reproach makes me sick . Anybody who says he is n't selfish is either a liar or a hypocrite . It 's the slogan of the reformers who use it to satisfy their own self-esteem ! ( She remains silent . He looks at her a moment ) Jane ! What 's the matter ? ( She says nothing ; she is staring ahead of her ) You are in a trance . Jane ! What 's the matter ? p. 124 JANE FOWLER I was just wondering GILBERT DABNEY Yes ? JANE FOWLER Never mind . GILBERT DABNEY But  --  tell me though JANE FOWLER I was just wondering if GILBERT DABNEY Well ? JANE FOWLER If you 're not too old for me ! ( TOWER comes down . ) GILBERT DABNEY ( Ca n't believe his ears ) If I 'm what ? ( Aware that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jane , I think you 're probably quite right . ( With a glance at TOWER on stair landing ) And as you find me too old for you , you are now perfectly at liberty to marry someone younger ! ( He goes out through hall . The outer door slams . ) WILLIAM TOWER That sounded very final . JANE FOWLER It is . WILLIAM TOWER Are you unhappy ? JANE FOWLER No . I think I 'm rather relieved . Poor Gilbert  --  I ca n't blame him . He 's given me so much gaiety and fun . He 's shown me a kind of life I have never known before . I 'm very grateful to him , really . p. 125 WILLIAM TOWER Then Benjamin Franklin was right after all . WILSON ( Comes in and announces ) LORD Frobisher . JANE FOWLER Allan , I 'm so glad to see you . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( Very down in the mouth , disagreeably ) Thank you , Jane . WILLIAM TOWER What 's the matter , Allan ? You look liverish . LORD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jane , what 's wrong with that husband of yours ? JANE FOWLER Why ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER As I got out of my car he bounded out of the front door , stared me straight in the face and said : " My God ! Too old for her ! " WILLIAM TOWER Allan , you must be very tender with Jane . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER Why WILLIAM TOWER ( Dramatically ) She is bereft , abandoned . Gilbert is deserting her . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER Serves her right . JANE FOWLER ( Mildly ) Allan that 's not very gallant . p. 126 LORD ALLAN FROBISHER On you , Mrs. Dabney , to exercise gallantry would be like singing madrigals to a deaf-mute ! WILLIAM TOWER You know , Jane , Allan is so rude I think he must be very taken with you . JANE FOWLER I would like that to be true , because , as a matter of fact , I 'm very taken with Allan . WILLIAM TOWER ( Carrying on the stiuation he sees developing ) And now that you 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is n't it ? I was just thinking  --  it might be very amusing to be married to you , Jane . It would certainly keep one on one 's mettle . ( JANE and TOWER exchange looks . Now that he has thrown out the hint , TOWER can not resist exploring its possibilities . JANE plays along with him . ) JANE FOWLER Thank you , William . I can return the compliment . It would be fascinating to be married to you . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( To JANE ) Marry Willie ! Last man on earth for anyone to marry . JANE FOWLER Why , Allan ? WILLIAM TOWER Why , indeed ? I feel a reckless impulse to propose to you , Jane . p. 127 JANE FOWLER Why suppress it ? WILLIAM TOWER But I ca n't propose to you in front of Allan . JANE FOWLER Why not ? It might give him some idea of how it 's done . It 's the one form of approach in which he 's had very little experience . WILLIAM TOWER ( In complete cahoots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would you ? JANE FOWLER ( A glance at TOWER , then a look at FROBISHER . She nudges FROBISHER farther along on the sofa to make room for TOWER . ) Let 's talk about it ! ( TOWER edges himself in beside her . The three sit in a row very close together ) Now , William  --  why not ? WILLIAM TOWER For one thing , Allan 's scarcely housebroken . JANE FOWLER ( Demurely ) That would give me something to do . WILLIAM TOWER I could offer you a more advanced form of occupation . JANE FOWLER Could you , William ? What would it be ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( Very jealous actually ) I hope it happens ! You deserve each other . The coldest man in England p. 128 JANE FOWLER Oh , I think you 're wrong there , Allan . I think William is very emotional , really . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( Scornfully ) That 's a joke ! JANE FOWLER You , Allan , are passionate . William is emotional . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER You deserve each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head off ! WILLIAM TOWER Pagliacci ! ( To JANE ) Obviously he is so annoyed at the prospect , he must really be interested in you . His is not an original mind and the fact that I 'm involved makes him feel that perhaps there are possibilities in you he had n't suspected . ( He takes JANE 'S hand . ) JANE FOWLER You are naughty , William . Do n't mind him , Allan . He is a dramatist and he can not resist what he considers a " situation . " WILLIAM TOWER ( He gets up ) I certainly ca n't resist this one ! I 'll give you exactly five minutes , Allan . Get rid of your business with Jane , during which time I shall collect my thoughts in the garden . Then I shall return and propose to Jane with consummate grace and ultimate efficiency ! ( He blows her a kiss and goes into the garden. ) p. 129 JANE FOWLER ( At once ) Now , Allan  --  any news ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER Yes . I 've done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moved ) Really ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER In fact she arrives in London at seven o'clock this evening . Once I get started I work pretty fast . That 's what I came to tell you . Somebody 'd better go to Croydon to meet her . JANE FOWLER ( Her hand on his arm ) Bless you ! LORD ALLAN FROBISHER Jane , I wish to make one thing very clear . ( He removes her hand ) I did not do this for you ! JANE FOWLER Well , whoever you did it for LORD ALLAN FROBISHER In fact , last time I left you I was determined not to do it . Absolutely determined . JANE FOWLER What made you change your mind ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER It was that bloody German Ambassador . He got my back up . JANE FOWLER I ca n't thank you enough . I sha n't attempt to . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER Since I did n't do it for you , you 're under no obligation to thank me . ( Awkwardly ) May I crave your indulgence and pour myself a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've earned the right to all your indulgences . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( With bitterness ) I may have earned the right  --  but thanks to you  --  I 've lost the knack ! JANE FOWLER What do you mean ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER When I look back at my life before I met you , it seems like the Green Pastures . JANE FOWLER Were you really happy , Allan , or were you just busy ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER I was happy ! Damned happy . ( Pitifully ) Jane , please let me keep the good times I had in the past . JANE FOWLER Of course , Allan , if you cherish them . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( Brooding into his glass ) Ever since you made that first remark JANE FOWLER What remark ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER About my being an elderly adolescent JANE FOWLER I 'll never say it again . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( Angrily ) But you think it ! You damn well think it ! p. 131 JANE FOWLER No , I do n't . I think you 're the sweetest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fury ) For pity 's sake , Jane , do n't drown me in the milk of human kindness . I 'm a selfish , egotistical , sadistic , malevolent man . I am vulgar and sensual and ambitous . And I enjoyed it all  --  till I met you . I wish to God , Jane , you 'd go back to Liverpool and your tea-cozies ! JANE FOWLER Actually , that is exactly what I am going to do . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( Feels a twinge at this but turns on her to cover it ) You 're a menace ! JANE FOWLER A menace ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER You 've undermined me ! JANE FOWLER Undermined you ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER With girls . I 've lost my knack . JANE FOWLER Perhaps you 've just lost the impulse . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER I have as much impulse as ever . ( Bridling ) What are you suggesting ? JANE FOWLER I 'm putting the most charitable interpretation on it . p. 132 LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( Indigo ) Lost my confidence . Called up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had another date ! Never happened before . I 'm self-conscious . I think now when I call ' em up JANE FOWLER What do you think ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER I think " Bloody old fool , what do you think you 're doing ? " It 's you , Jane ! It 's you have done that . I 'll never forgive you for it ! JANE FOWLER Dear Allan . Perhaps you 're growing up . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( Piling up the indictment ) And not only that JANE FOWLER More ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER Yes , more . What you said the other day JANE FOWLER What did I say the other day ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER That the girls were only interested because I did well by them . That I 've never been loved for myself alone . JANE FOWLER I could n't have said that . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER But you did  --  you did say it . JANE FOWLER Well , if I did I was mistaken or I was lying . ( With tenderness ) Because you are loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that better than I do . ( He has no comprehension of what she means by this. ) p. 133 LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( Vindictively ) Still , you 're getting a bit of your own back , are n't you ? JANE FOWLER How ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER That young bounder 's deserting you . Married you for your money and now he 's quitting you . He 's leaving you high and dry . What are you going to do now , All-Wise , All-Seeing Jane ? What are you going to do now ? JANE FOWLER Marry someone of my own age  --  if I can find him . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( This starts a new spiral of suspicion ; he backs away a step ) If you can find him JANE FOWLER Yes . I 'd have to find him first , would n't I ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER I see . ( Backs away another step . ) JANE FOWLER What do you see ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER I know you well enough to realize that when you announce a hope , it 's probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry someone of your own age ( With a quick look toward the garden ) Oh , my God ! Of course  --  Tower ! How stupid of me not to realize it before how stupid ( He laughs uncontrollably ) Now I understand why he 's here all the time . Why did he come back from India ? p. 134 JANE FOWLER I imagine when you 're in India , there comes a moment when you leave it . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER You 're too shrewd to let Gilbert go without having somebody to go to . JANE FOWLER I dore William . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( In a jealous dither ) Obviously . JANE FOWLER ( This is all playing beautifully into her hands ) He 's the most fascinating man I 've ever met . Imagine going to Malaya and all those remote places and seeing them through his eyes . Still , he 's rather complicated . Perhaps it would be safer to marry a simple man  --  like you ! LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( Aghast ) Oh , my God ! JANE FOWLER What if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALLAN FROBISHER Now I do want a drink ! ( He runs to liquor table and pours himself a quick one . ) JANE FOWLER ( To his back ) It 's true I 'm not an actress but I am married . Does n't that appeal to you , Allan ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER Please , Jane , do n't say that ! p. 135 WILLIAM TOWER ( Returns from the garden , watch in hand ) Clear out , Allan . Your five minutes are up . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( Goes quickly to him in a kind of panic ) Willie , you 're always going some place . Where are you going this time ? WILLIAM TOWER Tibet . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER Will you take me with you ? WILLIAM TOWER I 'm afraid you 'd be bored . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER I might be bored , but I 'd be safe ! JANE FOWLER Really , William , for a professional Don Juan , your friend Allan is the most easily frightened man I 've ever met . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( In extremis ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my club for a drink . JANE FOWLER ( To TOWER ) Also , your friend Allan drinks too much . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( Shouting defiantly ) Also , Mrs. Dabney  --  I am going to call up a girl ! ( He rushes out . ) JANE FOWLER ( Calling after him ) Good luck ! ( The front door slams hard ) Poor Allan ! p. 136 WILLIAM TOWER Why do you say that ? The old reprobate 's done awfully well for himself with his photographs , his undigested editorials and his peculiar buffoon-like charm . Undeniably , he has charm . JANE FOWLER He 's no fool . He knows what people think of him . He 's sensitive . WILLIAM TOWER He 's vain . JANE FOWLER You do n't like him , do you ? WILLIAM TOWER The odd thing is , I do . I do n't expect people to be better than they are . JANE FOWLER You have an extraordinary detachment . WILLIAM TOWER So have you , Jane . That 's what attracts me to you . JANE FOWLER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there really no hope for you and Millie ? WILLIAM TOWER I have made very serious mistakes in my life . Many of them have come from my abnormal inability to cause other people pain . The truth is , my marriage with Millicent was no good the moment it occurred . WILSON ( Comes in ) Excuse me , Madam , Mr. Crewe is here . JANE FOWLER Oh , yes , I sent for him . Come on in , Peter . ( PETER comes in. ) p. 137 WILLIAM TOWER Peter , I have done everything I could to discourage Ann from going on with you , but I have to acknowledge complete failure . PETER CREWE Well , sir , you have so much success in other fields . WILLIAM TOWER Do n't be contemptuous , Peter . I have read all your poems , even if they are almost unreadable , and I detect something in them that may one day make you a success . PETER CREWE ( Pleased ) Awfully glad you think so , Mr. Tower . ANN TOWER ( Comes downstairs ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FOWLER Wonderful news ! Peter , your wife 's in England ! ANN TOWER Jane ! PETER CREWE I ca n't believe it . It 's impossible ! WILLIAM TOWER Not for Jane . JANE FOWLER I did n't do it . Lord Frobisher did . PETER CREWE Really ? JANE FOWLER I know you put Lord Frobisher under a reactionary label . But in spite of his political opinions , he can respond to a human situation . PETER CREWE I suppose that 's the essential difference between us and the dictators . Even if we disapprove of someone we allow them to live . All right , Jane , you win . As you say he is kind , I shall allow Lord Frobisher to live . p. 138 WILLIAM TOWER I congratulate you on your tolerance , my boy . ( He solemnly shakes hands with PETER . ) JANE FOWLER Thanks to Allan , your wife arrives at Croydon at seven o'clock this evening . You must go to the airport to meet her . Both of you . PETER CREWE I 'll never forget what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JANE FOWLER She is about to become my daughter , is n't she ? Hurry along . ANN TOWER Good-bye , Jane . We 'll telephone from the airport . ( As they start out , TOWER calls ANN back . ) WILLIAM TOWER Ann ANN TOWER ( Returning ) Yes , Dad ? WILLIAM TOWER Will you accept my blessing ? And you , Peter ? Will you accept it , too ? ( Holds out his hand to PETER , who takes it ) Can you find it in your hearts to be generous to the defeated ? ( TOWER embraces ANN . ) PETER CREWE ( Simply ) Thank you very much , Mr. Tower . Please do n't think me superior ; because , although I could n't afford to admit it to my own advanced circle , I do admire you very much . ( A moment and then PETER pulls ANN 's hand ) Come on ! ( They go out . TOWER looks after them. ) p. 139 JANE FOWLER ( Her eyes on TOWER ) William , I believe you are quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They do n't know what 's ahead of them . We oldsters are moved by them because we do know . We remember our own youth , our hopes , and how life has slaughtered them . JANE FOWLER Rubbish ! You have n't done so badly . WILLIAM TOWER That remark , my dear Jane , is superficial . But I was n't joking just now when I said I thought Allan was attracted to you . As a matter of fact , I believe he 's in love with you . JANE FOWLER I think he is  --  but he 's terrified . WILLIAM TOWER Shall we knock him out of his panic ? JANE FOWLER ( Looks at him fondly for a moment ) Shall we ? ( Impulsively puts her arms around TOWER and kisses him ) I adore you , William . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( Bolts in , sees this ) Quite lovey-dovey , are n't you ? I wo n't have it , Jane ! You ca n't do this to me ! JANE FOWLER What ca n't I do to you ? LORD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ! p. 140 JANE FOWLER What happened to that girl you went to telephone ? Was she out ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( In deep depression ) She was in . JANE FOWLER Well ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( Sepulchral ) Lost my knack ! JANE FOWLER Do n't be depressed , Allan . Call up another one . You know so many . WILLIAM TOWER ( Starts in at once ) Allan , your coming in this minute is most inopportune . I was just about to propose to Jane . Will you please go into the garden and wait ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( Savage ) I will not go in the garden . I have hay fever and gardens are death to me ! WILLIAM TOWER It 's very difficult with you prowling about . ( To JANE ) How can I do a polished job with that morose buffalo sitting there ? JANE FOWLER Never mind him . Rely on your own technique . I 'm sure you 'll do a very good job . ( Takes pillow and throws it in front of TOWER for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courtesy ) Thank you . I 'll try , but do n't expect my best . ( He starts to kneel down but the joint in his knee pains him and he winces ) Oh ! ( JANE assists him to his knees ) Now Jane , my career is the victory of character over circumstance . So in a sense is yours . Shall we merge forces ? p. 141 JANE FOWLER Together we might have too much character . Do n't you think we ought to distribute some of it ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( Morosely ) I pity those that get it ! WILLIAM TOWER Allan , I must ask you please not to interrupt . ( Resuming , to JANE ) You remember , Jane , I once told you that as I 'm walking on one side of Bond Street I am irked by the wish to be on the other ? I think that with you ( Takes her hand ) I would be content to remain on your side of Bond Street . JANE FOWLER Dear William , I must warn you if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cross the street . WILLIAM TOWER But , Jane , it is I who am proposing to you , not Allan . LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( Out of his befuddlement ) Jane , do you think it is dignified at your age jumping in and out of marriage like this ? JANE FOWLER I do n't really know , Allan . It seems when you 've been married more than once it gets easier . WILLIAM TOWER Jane , you simply must concentrate on my proposal ! MILLICENT TOWER ( Coming down from upstairs , sees them ) What is this ? What is going on ? p. 142 LORD ALLAN FROBISHER He 's proposing to Jane . MILLICENT TOWER What is he proposing ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER Marriage . WILLIAM TOWER ( In fabricated anger ) Well , I would if I could get five minutes to myself ! MILLICENT TOWER ( Hysterical ) Marvelous ! Perfect ! Is n't it just like Jane  --  coming between husband and wife like this ! WILLIAM TOWER Millicent 's time-sense is defective . MILLICENT TOWER Not that I want you back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TOWER ( Mock anger ) No man ever proposed under such unfavorable conditions . Jane , where was I ? What point had I reached ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( Surly ) You were telling her how much character you had . I wish to God , Willie , you 'd go to Tibet . WILLIAM TOWER ( With exaggerated romantic flamboyance ) Jane  --  dearest Jane  --  wo n't you come with me to my villa in the South of France ? There , with the Mediterranean at your feet and the starry canopy of sky overhead p. 143 MILLICENT TOWER ( Cutting in ) Sounds very reminiscent JANE FOWLER It 's beautiful , William . But I 'm going back to Liverpool . WILLIAM TOWER ( Rises , picks up pillow ) I withdraw my offer . MILLICENT TOWER Thank goodness ! ( To JANE ) But what will you do with your house in Belgrave Square ? JANE FOWLER I shall give it to some charity . What do you think , Allan ? A home for wayward girls ? WILLIAM TOWER Admirable ! Allan will fill it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane and I will fill it ! We 're going to live in it ! MILLICENT TOWER Allan ! What are you saying ? LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( Ignores her ; to JANE ) You owe it to me . You 've robbed me of my confidence . You 've got to give it back to me . MILLICENT TOWER If this is a joke , it 's in very poor taste . WILLIAM TOWER It 's not a joke , Millicent . Allan is in love  --  calf love . p. 144 MILLICENT TOWER ( Completely bewildered ) Allan in love with Jane ? ( To JANE ) What about those habits ? What will you do with those habits ? JANE FOWLER I shall domesticate them . ( TOWER , his object achieved , feels he can relax . He lies down on the settee and covers his face with a pillow . ) MILLICENT TOWER ( To JANE ) You 're running such a risk . And for what ? JANE FOWLER For a very old-fashioned reason , Millie . I love Allan . MILLICENT TOWER Love ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She snaps the pillow from TOWER 's face ) Did you hear that Willie  --  love ! WILLIAM TOWER ( Sits up ) Yes , Millicent . Surely you 've heard of love . It 's been so much written about ! MILLICENT TOWER But it 's impossible ! LORD ALLAN FROBISHER ( On his feet , militant ) Why is it impossible ? What 's wrong with me ? MILLICENT TOWER I 've never heard anything so grotesque , so fantastic , so unbelievable ! p. 145 LORD ALLAN FROBISHER Why do you say that ? Jane marrying me for love Why is it unbelievable ? JANE FOWLER ( Goes to ALLAN and stands beside him ) Perhaps , dear Allan , it is unbelievable because it is the truth ! ALLAN , his confidence restored , takes JANE 'S hand , lifts it to his lips and kisses it as the curtain falls .
