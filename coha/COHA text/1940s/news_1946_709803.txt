txt Wage increases and adjustments aggregating $17,463,830 annually for 33,000 operating employes of the New York City Transit System and a collective bargaining system that would open the door to further increases each year were recommended yesterday by Mayor O'Dwyer 's Advisory Transit Committee . The group sent in a formal report to the Mayor at City Hall . Upon the appointment of the committee on Feb. 26 the Transport Workers Union , CIO , rescinded the strike call it had issued . The CIO union also withdrew its demand that it be designated as the exclusive bargaining agent for the transit system . Under the labor relations policy recommended by the Mayor 's committee , the TWU becomes the dominant labor group in the transit system , while the American Federation of Municipal Transit Workers , Local 21193 , AFL , is relegated to a secondary role . The committee 's recommendations would raise the average hourly pay of operating personnel from $1 to $1.20 , against the $1.25 sought by Michael J. Quill , international president of the TWU . Pay Increase Recommended " The hourly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all hourly rated employes , " the committee said . " Accordingly , the committee recommends that all hourly wage rates of the New York City Transit System should be increased by 20 cents . " Adoption of the committee 's wage recommendations , according to its report , would mean a subway deficit for the year ending June 30 , 1947 , of $75,000,000 . This figure includes the $17,500,000 of recommended wage increases and debt service of $57,000,000 . The 1946 passenger revenue of about $125 , - 000,000 is expected to remain at the same level in 1947 . The $75 , - 000,000 deficit thus will be 60 per cent of gross passenger revenue , or an average deficit of 3 cents on every 5-cent fare paid . " The basic cause of mounting deficits is not difficult to find , " the committee reported . " Giving effect to the committee 's recommendations , labor costs will increase 66 per cent in 1947 over the 1941 level . Other costs have advanced even more , and total operating expense will be up almost 70 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is 95 per cent of total revenue , will have increased only 12 per cent . " Mayor O'Dwyer had no comment on the report yesterday , saying he had been so busy with the truck strike that he had not had time to read it . Charles P. Gross , chairman of the Board of Transportation , said he would not comment on the report until he had read it . The committee recommended that its proposed wage increase be made retroactive to July 1 , 1946 . " The problem of an increased fare is not before the committee , " 1 the report said . " The city 's policy of supplying a partly free ride may , or may not , be preferable to the policy of a self-sustaining fare . But , whatever its justification , the city 's policy is the direct cause of the increasing deficits of the New York City Transit System . The city 's gift to its transport passengers should not be borne by its transport employes . " Bernard G. Brophy. president of the AFL transit local , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was " not at all satisfied " with the report . " It is definitely a Transport Workers Union report , " he said . " They got every single thing they asked for . Our organization has been shut out of the IRT Division right along , and the report still keeps us shut out because we canI not use shop stewards there . We intend to file a memorandum with the Mayor 's committee opposing the recommendations in their present form . " Austin Hogan. president of Local 100 of the TWU , said his union was grateful to the Mayor for the report and asked that its , salary recommendations be put into effect at once , retroactive to July 1 . In the field of labor relations as distinguished from wages , the committee declared that " the greatest degree of collective negotiation should be provided in public employ that is compatible with the maintenance of the essential attributes of the civil service system . On Bargaining Representatives " The Mayor , acting on advice of the Corporation Counsel . " it continued , " rejected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employes of the Board of Transportation . We , too , are of the opinion that exclusive recognition for the entire system should not be granted . " The committee favors the adoption of a system whereunder a majority , of the employes in an appropriate unit may select an agent to act as exclusive representative in collective negotiation for all employes in that unit . We refer to this system of recognition and collective negotiation as ' sole negotiation ' in the remaining portions of our report . We further recommend that collective negotiation , regarding wages , hours , and working conditions , be conducted yearly as is the general custom in private industry . " In an appendix to its report , the committee estimates that the first year costs of its recommended increases will be approximately $17 , - 463,830 , while the annual average increase for the years 1947-51 would be the lesser amount of $17 , - 292,531 . With collective negotiation recommended each year , the report apparently assumes that the employes will negotiate annually for about the same wages that they enjoy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on " sole negotiation , " the committee recommends that the city obtain special legislation from Albany to legalize the practice . It rejected compulsory arbitration , and declared that " joint negotiation " was impractical . It urged that an election be held as soon as possible to determine the sole negotiators , under the supervision of the State Labor Relations Board . The committee denied requests for a closed shop and a mandatory check-off of union dues , but favored a valuntary dues check-off authorized by the individual employe . Would Bar Strikes On the right to strike , the committee said : " Every strike of public employes challenges the authority of Gov ' ernment and thus tends to endanIger the safety and welfare of all the people . Whether or not a strike against the city by its transit workers would be illegal , we are certain that such a strike would b morally indefensible under the system of collective negotiation which we have recommended . A strike of the transit workers must be prevented by every means that the board and the city have at their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can impose on individual strikers , it can also refuse to negotiate with any union that authorizes or threatens a strike . We recommend that the board make clear that it will not tolerate strikes , and that strikers , individually and collectively , will strike at their peril . " It may be argued that effective collective negotiation is not possible without either the right to strike or the right to secure legally binding arbitration . The integrated demands of 33,000 men , however , represent a considerable force . When to this force is added the persuasion of advisory review with its impact on public opinion , collective negotiation will , in our judgment , operate effectively even though the final step of trial by combat is denied . The right to strike has been labor 's most potent weapon . The board 's denial of the right to strike and the board 's obligation to its employes are complementary . " The committee said it could not recommend payment of prevailing rates to 8,100 maintainers because it would increase their pay 70 per cent , but it conceded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without recommending a specific amount . Rise tor Operating Employes For 2,800 operating employes paid annually instead of on an hourly basis the committee recommended an additional $480 a year in salary . It Said the board could grant increases in whatever amount it considered proper for twenty-seven employes earning $6,000 a year or more . However , it denied recommendations for increases to 2,269 annually rated administrative employes on the ground that their present pay was in harmony with the scale for 100 , - 000 other civil service employes . The 500 transit police should get salaries within $100 a year of those paid to comparable grades in the Police Department , the committee said , It recommended further study of the pension systems to eliminate inequalities . Arthur S. Meyer was chairman of the committee , other members being Mrs. Anna M. Rosenberg , Edward P. Mulrooney , Samuel I. Rosenman and Theodore W. Kheel.
