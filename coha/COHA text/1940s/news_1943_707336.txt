txt merit of the armistice negotiations story from the Brigadier who participated in the meetings as one of General Eisenhower 's representatives . I remember reading that E. Phillips Oppenheim used to dictate his novels of international intrigue to a stenographer . But the real life story that the Brigadier dictated to a woman sergeant stenographer out-Oppenheimed anything that the old master ever dreamed up . On Split-Second Schedule It has everything except Joe Palooka disguising himself as the Emperor of Japan . After the interview the rest of the day was arranged on a split-second schedule . We rushed over to the airfield at 12:15 p. m. , and climbed aboard a B-25 that Marshal Tedder had assigned to us and to two Army photographers . The pilot and copilot , Lieuts . J. E. Terrett of Canton , Ohio ; and D. E. Ballard of Nashville , Tenn. , looked awfully young to me  --  about , old enough to be getting their first bicycles for Christmas . We had exactly an hour to fly out and look at one of the great scenes in recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrendering at sea . The ships were stretched out over five miles of sea in three perfect columns headed by two British battle wagons and six destroyers Behind them were the Italiar ships , the dreadnaughts Vittoric Vencto and Italia , five cruisers and four " cans . " We had expected to see three battleships , but we learned later that the Roma hat been sunk by German planes ofl Sardinia . One of the Italian ban 's wagons was trailing a big oil such from damage caused by Germar bombs , but she was keeping her place . The British battleship WarspitE challenged us with light signal : whereupon Lieutenant Ballard signalled me to pull the trigger of the Very pistol in the top of the cabin and shoot off our identification flares . The photographers snapped theft pictures and Lieutenant Terreti opened up the engines of the B-25 It was my first ride in the type 01 plane and it certainly is a beautiful ship , steady , dependable and easy to fly . We sat down oh the airport at 1:29 p. m. , just one minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tent . An RAF officer wanted me to sign in for the plane . But I told him it was n't my airplane . I 'd never seen it , before and had no idea where it was going . Ther we ran over to a Royal Navy limousine driven by a British Marine with a red band around hi : hat . We got down to the docks and aboard the British destroyer Hambleton just before it cast off lc take Sir Andrew Browne Cunningham and General Eisenhower to , see the Italian ships . The General and Admiral had just come from the daily war council of the Allied chiefs . Apparently the news from Italy was satisfactory because they were smiling as they went up to the crowded compass platform on the destroyer ' : bridge . Reviewing the Ships The destroyer kicked up 25 knots as it chased out of the harbor and within a half hour we were passing down the outside column of ships . When he noticed me standing on the bridge General Eisenhower said , " I thought you were up in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown and myself over and introduced us to Admiral Cunningham who had been fighting for three years to get the Italian fleet out of port and at this moment was realizing his ambition . Here stretched out before his eyes was a force that , suddenly added to our side , altered the whole global balance of sea power . Admiral Cunningham pointed out the Warspite and told me , " Be sure and put her in your story because she had a big part in bringing this about . She is flying the flag of Rear Admiral Bisset . " Then he corrected himself . " No , she is wearing the Wag of Admiral Bisset , that 's the way we say it now : ' Referring to the fact that the Italian fleet was more of a potential threat than a hard-hitting enemy during the three-year battle of the Mediterranean , Admiral Cunningham several times repeated the expression , " Ali , a fleet in being , you know , a fleet in being . " Apparently that is A naval axiom , and I was expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it must be something like a fleet in being requires a fleet hi watching , The camouflage of the Italian ships was very much like the British , basically dark gray with black streaks . Many of the designs of the recently painted Italian vessels were long triangles like the spaces on a backgammon board . None of the cruisers had any planes aboard , but there were two on the after catapults of the Vittorio Veneto and one on the Italia . General Eisenhower kept himself in the background . He gave me the text of the statement . " The Italian battle fleet is anchored under the guns of Malta , " and emphasized , " that 's not from headquarters but from the Admiral . This is his Dartv . " Message of Congratulation do n't you think it would be a good idea to send him a message of congratulation ? " General Eisenhower agreed ant dictated a telegram congratulating Admiral Cunningham on his victory over the Italian fleet it the Mediterranean . Then he changed the word " Italian fleet " to " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their promises and he did not want to hurt their feelings . Then he said , " Oh , why not : It was the Italian fleet . Put that back in . " Later I took the message back to headquarters and gave it to General Eisenhower 's aide to send to the Admiral . The big moment in the review of the captured ships came when we passed astern of the entire formation after Admiral Cunningham had warned the destroyer 's captain , " Do n't turn too sharp now and scare them . " The three long lines of mighty ships stretched out nearly to the horizon and General Eisenhower whistled and said , " That 's the way you see them in the movies . " asked General Eisenhower If he had formally congratulated the Admiral . " " There 's no formality between us , " he replied . " But have you told him it was a swell job ? " General Eisenhower laughed . " He knows it 's a swell job without my telling him . " I was beginning to look and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the history books , General ,
