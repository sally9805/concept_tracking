Dr. Robert J. Moon is a Chicago physicist who worked on the famed Manhattan Project . Thus , he knows a lot of " classi fied " ( secret ) facts about how Jo make atomic bombs . Last week he came to the rueful conclusion that his knowledge was threatening to be a bar to professional advancement . <P> Before and after his service on the Man hattan Project , 36-year-old Physicist Moon worked on atomic research at the University of Chicago . Last year McMasters University at Hamilton , Ont. offered him a job as head of its physics department . <P> Professionally , it was an attractive offer and a big step up . Bespectacled , talkative Dr. Moon jumped at the chance . He went to McMasters across the border and de livered one lecture . <P> Then his father , a Missouri lawyer , and Professor Ed Levi , of the Chicago Uni versity Law School , began to tell him that he might be heading for trouble . The Atomic Energy Act ( which Levi helped to write ) is vaguely phrased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For one thing , the Act threatens with the death penalty anyone who transmits U.S. atomic secrets to a foreign nation . <P> No Promises . Moon began to get cold feet about his nice Canadian job . He hur ried to Washington for a ruling from the Atomic Energy Commission . He got sym pathy and consideration , but in six months of asking , he got no specific ruling . Last week he decided to tell his troubles to the press . <P> In Washington , the commission ex plained that it could not forbid Dr. Moon to teach in Canada ; but neither could it promise forgiveness for everything he might do or say in future . If he divulged official secrets during lectures in Canada , he would certainly be in bad . Furthermore , he had better keep away altogether from Chalk River , Canada 's Government center of nuclear research , and he certainly could not continue as a consultant on U.S. <P> atomic projects . But if he used good sense in choosing his lecture subjects , he could probably keep out of trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was not the clearcut ruling that Physicist Moon wanted and it was not the clarification that many an other U.S. scientist had hoped for . Nuclear physics includes a bewildering mass of facts , figures and principles . Some are " classified " and known only ( the AEC hopes ) to scientists in its confidence . <P> Others have been declassified ; they were discovered before the war , or have been recently discovered by independent scientists . No physicist who possesses secret information can be entirely sure what is safe to talk about . If he talks to foreign agents ( or even to Americans not approved by the FBI ) he might conceivably be risking the death penalty . <P> Dr. Moon and his fellow physicists are still hoping that the AEC ( or Congress ) will eventually tell them where they stand . Until they get the word they can stand safely only in classes in U.S. schools , before classes of U.S. citizens , teach only what the Atomic Energy Commission marks unclassified.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
