Letters to The Times Milk Subsidy or Price Rise Withdrawal of Former Is Held to Mean Higher Cost to Consumer TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your editorial , " Dairy Subsidies , " in the Sept. 22 issue , emboldens me to call to your attention some related aspects of the problem . You conclude the editorial by saying : " If we are determined to eliminate wartime subsidies , the time to start is now . " I am very definitely of the opinion that , since the public ultimately pays the subsidy , through taxes , the public wants this problem resolved  --  fairly , intelligently and promptly . According to a recent study by Dr. Leland Spencer , Professor of Marketing at Cornell University , entitled " Wartime Economies in Milk Delivery , " " The milk subsidies ( in the New York milk shed ) *. * * will amount to approximately 1.8 cents a quart in 1945 . " These subsidies are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the equalization pool maintained pursuant to the provisions of the Federal-State milk marketing orders or by direct payments . Higher Prices Forecast If these subsidies are eliminated , as you suggest , there is the almost certain possibility that their discontinuance will be followed by a request , probably justifiable , on the part of producers for an increase in the price for Class I or fluid milk established by the marketing orders . Such increases as may eventually be granted will most certainly have to be passed on to consumers . I make that statement categorically because Dr. Spencer 's study shows that the average net profit , in 1944 , after taxes , of six leading milk companies , was only 1% cents per dollar of sales . Their profit , after taxes , on a quart of standard milk delivered to homes in New York in 1944 was .0033 cent and on a quart of standard milk delivered to food stores in New York .0006 cent . In the light of this profit position , it appears conclusive that any increase in producer prices as a result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have to be passed on to consumers in a higher price for milk . Consumers , however , and particularly those who purchase milk delivered to their homes and apartment houses , now have an opportunity to exercise a choice which will have the effect of preventing even higher prices than those which might become necessary as a result of elimination of subsidies and consequent increases in prices to producers . This choice consists of a determination on their part whether milk shall be delivered to them every other day or daily . The Spencer report , making certain assumptions , calculates that " the cost of delivering milk to retail customers would be increased by 1.3 cents a quart if the pre-war type of delivery services were reinstated . " In other words , if the producer subsidies of 1.8 cents a quart were to be replaced by increases in producer prices of an equal amount , and if consumers determine that they desire milk delivered every day to their homes and apartments , retail home-delivered milk prices will , of necessity , be increased at least 3 cents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumers in the New York-New Jersey metropolitan area of approximately $22,000,000 a year . Delivery Cost a Factor As the spokesman for twenty-three milk companies in New York City and Westchester County  --  companies which distribute at wholesale and retail over 75 per cent of all the milk and cream sold in the area  --  I know that it is not the desire of any one of these companies to increase the price of milk either at wholesale or at retail . This is indicated by the decision , announced last Friday , that the major milk companies plan to continue every-other-day delivery of milk even after Nov. 1 , when the Office of Defense Transportation delivery order is scheduled to be terminated . In the long run , however , the decision whether the wartime economies will be retained will be made by the consumer . Organized labor also will influence this decision . Far-sighted labor leaders will , I am sure , recognize the accuracy of the conclusions to be drawn from the Spencer report that retail routemen will work harder and receive less pay if a return is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long run , there are likely to be more retail routes and more jobs for routemen if every-other-day service and other economical practices are perpetuated . " To conclude : The discontinuance of the subsidies and the abandonment of wartime distribution economies may well cause an increase in the price of milk to consumers in this area of at least 3 cents a quart . Consumers can , however , insure themselves of a 1.3-eent-a-quart saving by demanding that there be no abandonment or discontinuance of the war-effected economies . While the return to every-day delivery might result in a temporary increase in the number of retail routemen employed , such action will eventually mean a shift of consumers from retail delivery to purchases at the stores and will ultimately mean that fewer retail routemen will be employed . The choice is before the public . EDWARD 0 . MATHER , Executive Director Milk Dealers Association of Metropolitan New York . New York , Sept. 27 , 1945 . National Strength Needed TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your editorial , " We Can Lose the Peace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national strength to meet the perils of peace . Between relatives with men in the services and those who wish to keep their own out there is real danger that Congress may I be stampeded into enacting measures calculated to weaken the nation in its international relations with the consequent danger of another bloody conflict . Congress should be made aware that there are at least as many of us with kin in the services or liable to draft who back your plea to resist all pressure to weaken our national defense , despite our yearning to have our loved ones with us . GEORGE HAHN . New York , Sept. 25 , 1945 . War Memorial Design Ready It Is Suggested That the Late George Gray Barnard 's Work Be Finished To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES Mr. Mertin 's letter , published Sept. 10 , wherein he objects to Mr , Moses ' ideas for war memorials , is very well expressed and I heartily agree with his view upon the subject . There can be no doubt that all the various projects suggested by our Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need hospitals , playgrounds , etc. , etc. , in ever-increasing numbers , but their connection with and symbolization of great and stirring events in our recent terrible conflict are , to say the least , extremely vague and quite beside the point . If we would glorify our valiant fighting men and wish to commemorate their splendid deeds of courage , tenacity and unselfishness , let us cast aside all utilitarian considerations and concentrate on the production of some great work of art which will fix forever in the minds and hearts of our people not only the terrible consequences of war but the immensely greater necessity for a lasting peace . To this end the late George Gray Smyth ' conceived and dedicated a magnificent work which he called a peace monument , and in which he hall expressed in a most splendid and original manner his profound belief that only by the constant reiteration and presentation of the peace idea will men learn to detest and eventually banish the image of the War God from a sorely troubled world . Barnard , with all his great talent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our midst , but his superb and final sculptural creation yet remains in plaster form and could and should be carried to completion as a marble monument of extraordinary distinction . If ever there was an appropriate time to execute this beautiful work it exists at the present moment , when the thoughts of all intelligent men and women are vitally concerned with the future welfare of every citizen of the great republic . CHAS . R. KNIGHT . Wood's-Hole , Mass. , Sept. 27 , 1945 . Historic Events at the Battery To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The appeal to preserve the Battery 's noted landmark , Castle Clinton , deserves approval not only in respect to the historic building but because of the memorials affixed to its walls . The disappearance of these tablets would remove reminders of historic value and their importance in awakening and preserving civic pride . The main tablet , in addition to the record of its various services beginning in ' 1807 , records the visits of General Lafayette in 1824 , President Jackson in 1832 , Kossuth in 1851 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lind began her famous song recitals in 1850 . Near by is the John Wolfe Ambrose Memorial , which , in connection with an engraved map , commemorates " the vision , scientific knowledge and indefatigable courage of John Wolfe Ambrose in making New York the greatest seaport in the world . " A third tablet marks the site where the Salvation Army 's flag was first unfurled March 10 , 1880 . ALBERT ULMANN . New York , Sept. 20 , 1945 . Advantage Seen in Idleness To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In your editorial yesterday , " Jobs and Job Insurance , " you stated that many workers doubtless ask theme selves , " Why work for $32 a week when you can get $21 for a long time by not working ? " You overlooked the fact that the $32 a week employe has 20 per cent withheld , while the person receiving compensation insurance for not working gets the full amount . As a practical result , if the Administration 's efforts to make $25 the amount to be paid for unemployment insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying income tax would be better off not working and receiving $25 net . And this is exactly what is happening in many places right now . WILLIAM V. Maus . Passaic , N. J. , Sept. 27 , 1945 . St. Augustine Has Surreys To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : There are still surreys in St. Augustine . They have fringed tops and orange or red wheels and curtains for a rainy day . They are trimmed with bright tissue paper rosettes and bows and are drawn by one or two sleek and lively horses . The drivers are Negro gentlemen of magnificent poise , who give a continuous historical lecture as they drive about town . PEARL E. YOUNG . St. Augustine , Fla. , Sept. 25 , 1945.
