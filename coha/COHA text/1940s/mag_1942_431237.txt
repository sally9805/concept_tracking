WHENEVER anyone asks what effect the war is going to have on engineering progress , I think we should remind ourselves that it is going to have exactly the effect we permit it to have . The war-born shortages of critical materials and skilled labor are going to bring us face to face with new problems never dealt with before . If we permit these problems to discourage us , engineering progress will come slowly to a standstill . But if we attack them with the same vigor and determination that have characterized American engineers in the past , we are going to enter into an age of opportunity and development such as we never experienced before . We must understand that war can be either a green light or a red light to progress . And which it becomes depends entirely on us . We set the signals . Some work must be stopped to get the materials for war , but we do n't have to mentally stop our work and dig in for the duration . We must take advantage of the great impetus which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the universe in which we live . The answer we make to this question is extremely important to the young men who are going to be running the industries of tomorrow . It is one of the most important questions we face today . We are building the future now ; the opportunities and hopes of millions of young people are in our hands . What are we going to do about them ? A great many people today are asking , " Has science ruined the world or is it saving it ? " You can get on both sides of a question like that . Not long ago I happened to attend a meeting at which the toastmaster was an economist . He said , " The scientists are dragging the world to chaos . No stable civilization can exist as long as inventors continue . " In the course of the meeting I had an opportunity to reply to him . I told him that no one was forcing him to use any of the things that science had produced . All he had to do was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | stop . Then it would be easy for him to go back to the optimum and live happily . Only a short while later I was thrown in contact with the same man when he was extremely ill . He had a streptococcus infection , and his doctor had told him that he did not have much chance to recover . The sulphone compounds had just been discovered at this time , and I happened to know several doctors who had already acquired considerable experience in using them in the treatment of strep infections . I told him , You can save yourself , but you will need the work of some scientists to help you do it . " " Please do anything you can , " he said , " I do n't care how much it costs . " Within a week he was cured . Now he has had a complete turn of heart , and I have not heard him say once since that time that he would like to stop scientific progress . It ca n't be stopped because we know so little . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , we had better recognize the fact that progress is n't something that can be started or stopped by turning a spigot on or off . There is no standing still in nature . Either we move forward or we slip backward . Americans have always prided themselves on being a progressive people . Our inventors and engineers are the finest in the world . We need their services now . This is not the time to attempt to stop progress . If we are going to win the war , and we most certainly are going to win it , we must have an " all-out " scientific contribution . Now , more than ever before , we must keep our laboratories running and our inventive minds busy . We have two great problems . First , we must win the war . Second , we must have something to do after the war is won . Most of us retain a very clear picture of what happened after the last war . We entered into a period of depression and prosperity and ' then depression once more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and materials such as no country in the world had ever had before . Our problem then was to find some profitable employment for our excesses . Today our problem is one of shortages , but eventually we are going to have to face that problem of excesses again . I am perfectly willing as a representative of our so-called researchers and inventors to take full responsibility for that condition . The only way I can see that we could have excesses of men , money , and materials was not to have enough projects , and it is the duty of the researcher and inventor to develop new things so that we can have enough projects to provide employment and a decent standard of living for everyone . This is a mechanized war , and the new things that are going to come out of it will be simply amazing . In the automobile industry alone , we are already changing many of our old ideas . When the war is over , we are going to have new fuels and materials such as we hardly dared even to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build vehicles for types of service that would wreck any ordinary car in less than an hour . The other day I was talking to a group of men who asked , " Why is it that the Army ca n't use the same kind of trucks we use in industry ? " The simplest answer to that is the fact that industry 's trucks are made to run on highways , while the Army has to run theirs on everything but the highways . They ca n't get the enemy to come down to the road , so they must be able to chase them through fields and over gullies . That is why we have four-wheel drives and six-wheel drives . It 's not a thing that we should complain about . For the boys who are doing the fighting , it 's a a matter of giving them the best fighting equipment we know how to build . For those of us who are doing our job in industry , it 's an opportunity to obtain a lot of valuable experience in doing something which is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . If we are fighting a mechanized war , we might as well understand what it means . I would like to take the cellophane wrapping off of that word " mechanized " and see exactly where we fit into it . We have been in the automotive business so long that I sometimes think we forget what we are  | doing . Automotive simply means self-moving . The automobile is a power vehicle , and the automotive industry is a power industry . When we talk about mechanized war , we are talking about power war . The installed power of all the central stations in the United States now amounts to about 40,000,000 horsepower . Grand Coulee Dam , which has been under construction for several years , contains enough materials to fill a double row of freight cars from New York to San Francisco and will develop 1,500,000 horsepower when completed . That is a lot of horsepower in anybody 's lan guage , but it is less than one third of the monthly produc tion of aircraft engines in the United States before the war broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horsepower every thirty days . There are now about 32 , - 000,000 vehicles on the American highways . If we rate each of these at 50 horsepower , which is considerably less than the advertised value , we will find that there are 1,600 , - 000,000 horsepower installed in automotive transportation alone . Now our 40,000,000 horsepower does n't look so terribly big any more , and the 1,500,000 horsepower at Grand Coulee is hardly worth mentioning . In other words , the automotive industry is the greatest power-producing industry in the world . There is still a lot of room for improvement , however . The automobile is very inefficient in the use of fuels . Except in the case of the Diesel , we rarely get more than a ten-percent thermal efficiency from the engines and fuels we now have , and we can not continue that sort of wastefulness forever . The reason I say it can not continue is not that we are likely to run out of fuels , but that some bright young fellow is going to come along with an idea which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the things that are going to come out of this war . In the last World War , the best gasoline we had was 50 octane . With this gasoline we were able to run the Liberty engine , which was almost the same size as the modern Allison engine , at about 450 horsepower . Now we have 100-octane gasoline and are able to develop 1,200 horsepower or better from the Allison engine . The only thing that prevented our building an Allison engine in 1916 was the fact that we did n't have gasoline good enough to run it . Today we need all of our 100-octane gasoline for aircraft fuel . For commercial engines , we are going to have to go back to lower-octane fuels than the 70 to 80-octane gasoline we were using when the war started . We are going to have to learn what we must do to run our engines on these poorer fuels , and when the war is over and we have all the 100-octane gasoline we need , we are really going to go to town . By that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have engines built to use the large quantities of 100-octane fuels released from wartime use . The efficiency of all engines will be much higher than today , which will result in more miles per gallon . That may sound like a very rash prediction , but it is altogether possible . If someone had opened a travel office thirty-eight years ago and tried to sell tickets for an airplane flight across the ocean , he would probably have been considered crazy . It was only thirty-eight years ago that the first flight was  | made . That was on December 17 , when the Wright Brothers set the world 's first nonstop record of 120 feet in 12 seconds . You would think a feat like that would have made headlines in every newspaper in the country . But , as a matter of fact , when the brothers telegraphed to their sister Catherine in Dayton an account of the flight . she could n't find a single reporter willing to use the story . She rang up one of the local papers on the telephone , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until finally one fellow answered it and said , " Well ? " This is Catherine Wright , " she replied . " and I have just received a telegram from my brothers . It says : ' We have just made the first flight in a heavier-than-air machine and will be home for Christmas . ' " After she had finished , the fellow said . " Well , I 'm glad to hear the boys are going to get home for Christmas . " That is a true story told to me by the reporter himself . " I would have been crazy if I had said anything else , " he explained . " In the first place , we had all been taught it was impossible to fly a heavier-than-air machine . Anyone who thought he could fly was crazy . Whether or not a thing like that is crazy depends on which way we have our sights leveled , forward or backward . People of limited vision have decried the practicability of every invention in the history of man . Still the human race has progressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that progress , we must maintain our laboratories intact and encourage our inventors . The emergency of war is going to provide a great impetus for scientific research . In many ways , this is an era of unrivaled opportunity for the individual inventor . We need never fear our running out of problems or opportunities . The progress of the human family is like the old story of the man who went out to slay the dragon with a hundred heads . He was given a charmed sword and was told , " This sword will cut off any head that the dragon has . There is just one catch to it . Every time you chop off one head , two more will grow in its place . " Every time we solve one problem , two more grow in its place . That is the reason why I say we need never fear our running out of opportunities in the future . Our problems today are our opportunities tomorrow . There will never be a shortage of problems .  |         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
