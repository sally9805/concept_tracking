" It 's too bad , " grumped Trainer Jimmy Jones . " Why could n't a fellow have these two horses in separate years ? " The two wonder horses-Citation and Coaltown-were the same age ( 3 ) , had the same daddy ( Bull Lea ) and the same owner ( Calumet Farm ) . Apparently , each was the other 's only competition : it seemed a sheer waste of horsepower to put both of them on the same race track . <P> Last week the Jones boys ( Jimmy and father Ben ) were spreading their horsepower around a bit . Jimmy took Citation down to Camden , N.J. , to run in the $50,000-added Jersey Stakes . Father Ben was back at Belmont Park saddling Coaltown in the $25,000-added Withers Stakes . <P> The Goose . Coaltown was a horse the horseplayers really loved . A walnut-brown with a pert personality , he had been beaten only once ( by Citation in the Kentucky Derby ) . His admirers were certain that it could never happen again . Because he ran with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they called him " The Goose . " At the post , his odds were 1 to 7 . <P> He broke like a shot and led into the stretch . Then 41,877 fans saw a sight they had trouble believing . Instead of pulling away , Coaltown was staggering . Vulcan 's Forge caught up and passed him . A stunned audience had to wait for a photograph to make sure The Goose had finished even as well as second . <P> The Gangbuster . It was a different story at Camden . Jockey Eddie Arcaro ( TIME , May 17 ) , who came down to ride , said of Citation : " It 's fun . I did n't have much confidence in him the day he won the Derby . Now I play a little game-I let those other horses sneak up pretty close , then I cluck to him . Wow ! You can feel the power . What a gangbuster ! " <P> As a gangbuster , Citation is an unspectacular mahogany bay . When he moves from behind , he seems to draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on slowly . When Citation sets the pace ( he runs just as well that way ) , he looks lethargic and uninterested . Once he gets in front , the jockey has to keep reminding him that he is in a horse race . With the odds 1 to 10 , Arcaro played his little game again with Citation , to the delight of the fans . He let other horses sneak up on him , then clucked . The gangbuster won by ten lengths-clipping if seconds off Garden State 's mediocre mile-and-a-quarter track record . <P> If there had been any real question about which horse was king of Calumet , the question was answered . There had never been any doubt in the mind of wise old Ben Jones . Says he : " Unless he has a bad break , I believe you may see the greatest horse of all time before Citation is through .
