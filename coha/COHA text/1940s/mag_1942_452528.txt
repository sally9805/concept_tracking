months before the war broke out 1 bought this house on the water 's edge , looking northeast up the two miles of the Carrick Roads . It was then my intention to leave London for good . The railroad company calls our region the Cornish Riviera , but that year there was precious little Riviera about it . I was writing a novel called Fame Is the Spur , and when the war came I left London in order to finish it here in peace . There was emotional impetus enough to carry me on , and the work was ended by January 1940 . Now , I thought , I could get on with something new . I lied in my mind three themes for long novels and a theme for a tale that would need only a couple of hundred pages in the telling . I would rest now , I said to myself , for a few months after the long labor of Fame Is the Spur . Then in the summer months I would easily knock out the little tale : it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming of the next winter I would take another long novel in hand . Nearly eighteen months have passed since then , months loaded with destiny , heavy with hopes and fears , with few triumphs and many disasters : months that have conjured up words which will never die out of hearts now living , old words with new dramatic outlines ? Norway , Dunkirk , Libya , Greece , Crete , Vichy , Coventry , London , Plymouth . And as these old names , crusted with terrible contemporary significance , rose up week by week and month by month , 162there seemed no end to the possibility of their extension ; there was no peep vouchsafed round the corner of the future ; and , for me at all events , everything that had made work possible faded and shriveled till I was faced with the inescapable fact that , so long as these clouds lowered over us , I was done for as a writer . I have never agreed with the saying ? was it Stevenson 's ? ? that easy writing makes hard reading . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are writers who write easily and there are writers who write with blood and tears , and , confronted by a page of each , you would n't know which had done which , for both the pages would be good finished work . And similarly , two men writing , one with ease and one with labor , will each produce a result as dead as mutton . A writer writes as lie writes , and that is all there is to it ; and many a writer will tell you that his best work has been done with a blithely flowing pen . Certainly in my own case , for what the result is worth , the work has been easy . I could sit down to my daily piece of writing with the knowledge that it would be done . There was no fluttering invocation of the goddess of fiction , whoever she may be . I liked the look of a clean sheet of paper ; I liked the actual physical business of taking up a pen . In a word , I enjoyed my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an American who , of all things , was a priest of the Jesuit order . Americans write to authors far more often than English people do , and their letters , as a rule , are more naive than English letters . This correspondent said he had been reading My Son , My Son ! and he went on , ' I am anxious to write a best-selling novel myself and would be very grateful for any advice you could offer me . ' I could not answer this , because when I was writing My Son , My Son ! I did not know I was writing a best-selling novel : I knew only that I was writing a novel . I rely very much on what Mr. Somerset Maugham has called ' the amiable and useful little imp that dwells in your fountain pen and does for you all your best writing . ' There is sense in Mr. Maugham 's conclusion : ' The prudent writer gives him his head , and , if the little fellow has a mind to write something quite different from what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to yield . After all , it is to this wily sprite that is due whatever merit the ignorant ascribe to the unimportant instrument who holds the pen . ' Never have I cast myself more completely upon the winds of chance than I did in my first novel , Shabby Tiger . Here , for a long time , I did not know where I was going to , much less how I was going to get there . I had for a long time promised myself that I would write a novel , but no grand theme , no imposing canvas , presented itself to my imagination . And I was very lazy . I was working on the staff of the most easygoing newspaper in the world . I did not appear in the office till half an hour after noon . Well , one did n't work in the mornings . One read the newspapers and did this and that , and time slipped pleasantly by . At one o'clock one knew what the day 's work was to be ; and then there was lunch to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a game of dominoes . It was not often that one returned to the office much before three , and then there was always someone waiting there for a game of shove-ha'penny on the excellent board which had recently been brought into the office . The public houses shutat three ; there was just time to take the board to one in order to polish it before the game began . No self-respecting shove-ha'penny board is polished in any other way than by allowing beer to flow over it and then rubbing it dry . It was necessary , of course , to keep the board company , and one returned to the office in a benevolent if unworkmanlike frame of mind , to find , when the shove-ha'penny game was over , that it was high time for tea and muffins . Another game of dominoes was now a matter of course , and if , between this and seven o'clock , one 's daily offering of prose fit for the eye of the world 's most exacting editor was made ? why , one was then prepared to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'clock : time for the nightly consortium in a near-by bar , where leader writers coming on duty and reporters going off could fittingly begin or end their respective endeavors . Then , at eight or half-past , dinner at home in that physical and mental state called mellow , averse from vigor , inimical to effort , admirable for smoking a pipe as one perambulated the suburb in summer or read a book in winter . So the weeks went by , and the months and the years , filled with good company , admirable conversation , a creeping paralysis of the will . There are times when , if a man is to be saved , he must be taken by the scruff of the neck , hustled out of his greenhouse , and dropped into cold water . This salutary miracle was performed on my behalf . II I do not think I have a pennorth of superstition in my make-up . I am a pragmatic sort of person who takes things as he finds them and tries to judge them as they are . I have met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been visited by intimations from outside sense ; and I have never believed a word that they have told me . What happens to us , I think , is explicable wil hin the confines of reason , if only we could get hold of the facts . Two things completely inexplicable have happened to me , but they do not alter my rational outlook . When I was a child of five , my family moved from one small house in Cardiff to another . There was not much to move , and my father , with a hired handcart , did the job in a number of journeys . On one of these , towards the end of that winter day , he took me and my brother , a little older than me . We trotted to the new house alongside the handcart , and my father left us there when he went back for more things . He sat us side by side on an armchair in the kitchen . On our right was the lighted fire . Facing us was a window , uncurtained , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for darkness was now come . There we sat , and I at least was scared to the very marrow of my bones . The strange house , the blackness beyond the window that might conceal ? what ? ? the creaking of the stairs , and then , suddenly , the banging of a drum and a great shout , ' The blood ! The blood ! ' ? all this left me trembling with fright . The drum and the shout , I learned later , belonged to the Salvation Army , but at the time there was no knowledge to comfort me . It was , no doubt , in consequence of this that during the years when we lived in that house I was visited again and again by a nightmare . Always it was the same . I would be sitting in the chair , with everything as it had been : the firelight , the darkness beyond the window . It was a small window of four panes , and in my nightmare I gazed , with the hair rising in horror on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that something would materialize there out of the darkness . Presently the top of a head would appear , and I was aware of someone kneeling on the ground , his fingers clutching the window sill , raising himself with infinite slowness to gaze into the room . Bit by bit , the face appeared , till it was all there , fixed and unmoving , a horrible face , white , with staring bloodshot eyes . After a while , it would begin to disappear as slowly as it had come . On the right of anyone kneeling as this apparition was kneeling there was a door leading into the scullery , and this scullery opened into the kitchen where I sat . In my nightmare , I knew that now this ghastly visitor was passing through the scullery door , that it was only a matter of time before the door between the scullery and the kitchen would open , and he and I would be face to face . Now my eyes turned to this door through which he must come , and my heart was wrung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have since known , asleep or awake . The latch would silently lift , and a hand would come into the room : a long white cruel hand that I was destined never to see attached to a body . For at this point , sweating with horror , I always woke to hear my heart pounding in the darkness and to feel the comfort of my brother 's body in the bed beside me . It is many a year since this nightmare last troubled my sleep , and , looking back on it now , it is easy to explain the whole matter by referring it back to that first night when a small nervous child shivered in darkness , in an unknown house . But here is the point of the matter which I can not explain . I told no one of this recurrent horror till many years later . We had left the house ; my brother and I were young men whose lives were filled with multifarious activities . One day we were speaking of our childhood , of that strange frightening first night in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nightmare that had been its consequence . I had only opened the story when he took me up . ' And then this happened . And then that . ' And with perfect accuracy of detail he described the experience from beginning to end . ' I , too , ' he said , ' had that nightmare again and again while we lived in that house . ' A nightmare of vague terror , arising from an experience shared , I could understand coming to him as to me ; but I can not understand this duality of incident in those points which were not comprised in the experience itself : the horrible face , the slowly rising latch , the strangler 's white fearful hand . So I must leave it at that : a record without comment . The second inexplicable thing that came to me came now while 11 was enjoying that lotus life in Manchester , watching the years slip by , watching my sons grow up , careless , happy-go-lucky , with old ambitions slowly stifling like flames beneath a bonfire too thickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our suburb of Didsbury there lived a woman who was often to be found telling fortunes at local church bazaars and suchlike functions . She did it ' for fun . ' She was not taken very seriously , and I do not know whether she took herself seriously . Towards the end of the summer of 1931 ? just ten years ago from this time when I write ? this woman met my wife in the street . ' Oh , Mrs. Spring , ' she said , ' I have a message for you . Your husband 's career is about to have a great change . He 'll stay in journalism , but there 'll be a great change ? a great change . ' We had a hearty laugh over that . We were contented where we were . Life was pleasant , moderately prosperous , and , as for change , at least I was not seeking it . I had been asked more than once why I did n't try my luck in Fleet Street , and always I made the same answer : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . ' Within a couple of months Fleet Street had asked me , and after a lifetime spent in provincial journalism I found myself in London . I was forty-two years old . III Let me pause for a moment to speak of my ' addiction ' to pictures . It is difficult to believe that twenty years have passed since I bought a picture from George Russell ( X ) . ' I hope , ' he wrote from 84 Mcrrion Square , Dublin , ' that it will not prove too tiresome a possession . ' Well , it has n't done that , though I do not think so highly of it as I did twenty years ago . It is a picture of a group of girls , some swimming in the sea , some diving from the rocks , with a dawn sky making a cool blue-gray background . It is , perhaps , a little sentimental , but I have never regretted buying it . Russell sold his pictures literally by the yard . When I asked him how much this picture cost , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This picture is small but a masterpiece , and this one is big but not very good , " so I paint on three sizes of canvas , and charge accordingly . ' He was a most prolific painter . The Dublin drawing-rooms were full of his work . He had two styles : one the presenting of things seen , like the picture I bought from him ; the other the presenting of things imagined . These were a figuring in paint of the strange thoughts that crowd his book , The Candle of Vision . Creatures all flame glowed on the canvas , and , in recollection , they seem to me to have been not without splendor . I wish I had one of them , to represent to me the other side of this dual man , so practical and so apocalyptic . Russell 's office , from which he conducted the business side of his life , was on the first floor of the house in Merrion Square . He had painted the walls ? every inch of them ? with the tumultuous creatures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his spectacles gleaming , his large foul pipe ejecting coltsfoot fumes from out of his large beard . One never , on calling upon him there , got the sense of intrusion . He was there to talk , and I imagine he would consider it a bad day if a disciple or two had not come and sat at his feet . But such a day he must have known rarely . He would sit in a big easy chair in the midst of the untidy disheveled room , himself untidy , kindly , careless-looking , and the soft alluring Irish voice would run on and on . It is a pity some young Irishman did not constitute himself Russell 's Boswell . He would not have lacked matter . One day , I remember , a young Indian who had come to Europe to study agricultural methods called while I was there to talk to Russell about his cooperative creameries . But the conversation ? if conversation it could be called ? did not stay with the creameries for long . Soon Russell was on the subject of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his caller was not deeply versed in them . He proceeded to enlighten him . Exposition and quotation flowed out of him , ceaselessly , remorselessly . It was a remarkable moment to observe : as though some learned Indian sage , finding a young Englishman who did not know his Shakespeare , had taken up the task of education . Russell once told me that he had given up reading and pondering on the Hindu scriptures because they had taken him into deeps which he felt to be dangerous . His was a strange life ? " twixt the mount and multitude . ' It is a long time since I last saw Merrion Square . I do not know whether it has survived in the charming form I knew , or whether Dublin has been as reckless with its things of beauty as London was . Certainly Merrion Square was a thing of beauty , and in later years as I walked through the London squares with my ears deafened by the hammers of the housebreakers , as I watched Berkeley Square disintegrating and St. James 's Square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in time to come pupils in architecture would go to Merrion Square in order that they might see with their own eyes what a Georgian square in London had looked like . Now that German bombs have reduced to dust and ashes so much that was lovely in London , I hope we shall be more inclined to treasure what may chance to be left . We raise a ready outcry about the aerial vandals who have spoiled or destroyed so much of our cultural heritage ; but we were destroying it ourselves hand over fist . Let us hope this will make us call a halt . The old squares , during the ten years I lived near London , were savaged ? there is no other word for it ? with a ruthless disregard for amenity and propriety . Now that so much has gone in the flame of war , what would we not give to have Nash 's regency crescent once more in Regent Street ? And , as we look at the wreckage of the Wren churches , does a blush visit our cheeks when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them were in the market ? They were ' superfluous . ' No regard was had to beauty then . Treated like so much brick and stone and mortar , standing on so many sites , they were there to be bought by any merchant who cared to raze them and build a concrete warehouse . These metropolitan monuments were not all . In the twenty years between the two wars we ran riot , trampling and ruining the irreplaceable monuments of our past . Quiet village streets were smashed overnight by the march of arterial roads . A cinema had but to ask for the site of a manor , and there was no one whose business it was to say , No . There are some things in England that money ca n't buy . ' Money , in those days , could buy anything , destroy it in an hour , and cause to spring up , where some beauty of our race had been , the cheap and spurious simulacrum , common to cheap and spurious men everywhere . Our woods and forests were cut down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smeared with houses whose ugliness was an offense to earth and heaven . There 's one good thing about all this bombing . It 's clearing away rubbish that ought to have been cleared long ago . ' True enough ; but it 's an expensive method of slum clearance , and not a kindly one to the slum dwellers ; and it makes a queer comment on our vested interests ' when something so cataclysmic as this is needed to do what should have been done without it . But most ironic of all to me is the thought that we have , for the last twenty years , been destroying the loveliest country in the world in order to cram upon it the sort of building which , in measurable time , will belong to this class which we now thank God for destroying by the scourge of war . If we had gone about it with brains in our heads , we might have devised a method of cleaning up Limehouse and White-chapel without destroying the Temple . The last time I saw George Russell was on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For years Irishmen , united against the English , had waged the fight that opened on an Easter Day during the Great War . The shame of the Black and Tans ' had been loosed on the country . It was not so much warfare as a murder campaign on both sides ? vendetta , revenge . Men were surprised and shot in their beds . Masks and disguises played a greater part than uniforms . Arson , sudden death out of the night ? this had gone on for years , engendering feelings more bitter than any that are created in the confrontations of warfare . And now there were those who said it was time to make an end , to come to an accommodation with England . A treaty had been drawn up , and on this January night Dail Eireann , the Irish Parliament , was to decide whether or not to ratify it . It was the last day of many days of bitter wrangling and debate , there in a great hall of the new Irish University buildings . I watched them throughout , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon , unsated with warfare , were to turn their arms upon one another . Not many of them were notable to the eye . Beyond a certain bluff emphasis of character in Michael Collins , who had the masterly physique that boys love , ? a big burly body , a massive head adorned with plentifulblack hair , ? and a subtle blend of loving-kindness and relentlessness in Eamon De Valera 's face , there was nothing to raise any one of them to the distinction that calls for a second look . Charles Burgess , who had been De Valera 's War Minister , was the most implacable and unpitying figure there . Unlike Collins and De Valera , he had no gift of speech . His words were halting , and pitched on a single unsonorous note . He was a small man with a face that became impressive from its lack of expression . You looked at him the first time , and your glance wandered on to find something more interesting . But watch him , as I did , through a morning and an afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there began to be something uncanny in the masklike immobility of his features . They seemed to me to be like a portrait which you would n't mind seeing occasionally in the house of a friend , but which would make you scream if you had to live with it . The face was extraordinarily dry and empty of emotion . The skin was dry ; the very hair had the dry sapless look of a wig . Arthur Griffith was there , short , stocky , bulldoggy , his pince-nez gleaming as he defended the treaty-makers against incessant assault ; and Erskine Childers , the Englishman who had given his life to Ireland , a thought-haunted gray wreck of a man , so physically weakened that not long before this I had seen him fall off a bicycle in Merrion Square . There they were ? these and so many others ? in that big room which became , as the days wore on , so hot with the public breath , so foul and stale with tobacco smoke , all trying patriotically to speak in Erse and finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were at home . There they were , with doom and death hanging over so many of them once the final rupture had come , once the treaty was accepted , and those who would not accept it turned in a madness of civil strife upon those who did . In measurable time now this phlegmatic little Charles Burgess will fall , riddled with his old companions ' bullets , as he runs from a blazing hotel ; Collins will be shot mysteriously as his car makes its way through the Irish countryside ; Childers , who gave so much to Ireland , will face an Irish firing squad that will relieve him of his remaining tenuous vestige of life ; Arthur Griffith will die in harness . But we do not see their doom that January night as we wait for the voting on the treaty . It was accepted by 64 votes to 57 ? a margin too narrow , too narrow by far , for safety . I shall not forget the great hubbub that broke out when the figures were declared , or the sight of De @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head buried in his arms , or of Michael Collins standing dominant and erect , looking about him with flashing eyes ? Collins who was soon to be so low , De Valera who was soon to be so high . It was in that moment that I last saw 2E . We were jammed together in a great press of people passing out into the night . He was very deeply moved . ' We have opened a door , ' he said . Yes , indeed ; and it was opened upon strange things whose end is not yet seen . ' I am sure you will be in Ireland again , ' YE wrote to me soon afterwards . We are hardly the spiritless folk who make no history to interest our neighbors . But I hope the history that brings you will not be military history . ' Now At has joined so many others who were ' in ' at that historic moment . What history will take Englishmen back to Ireland is not yet apparent . But , to a discerning eye , the outlines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long way from the interest in pictures with which I began . By a coincidence , that very morning when I began to write about pictures an exciting-looking flat parcelarrived from Manchester , and I knew before I opened it that these must be the drawings by L. S. Lowry that I had asked a Manchester friend to send on . I have long been fascinated by the work of this artist , and shall use this chance to pay him tribute . Manchester has produced greater artists . They leave the city and go away in quest of color and clients . Lowry has chosen to stay in Lancashire , and if he is not Manchester 's greatest artist , he is at any rate the one who can evoke the drab streets , the hard-beaten patches of earth called crofts ' on which the children play , the gray smoke-filled sky with the mill chimneys soaring against it , the street-corner pubs , and the pale pathetic artisans as no artist , to my knowledge , has done before . More than this : his pictures evoke for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Revolution clamped upon the land . All that men and women have been defrauded of , all that they are not , are here implicit in the stark statement of what they have and are . Here it is , whether you like it or not ; here it is , the stricken field on which the fight for Britain 's industrial supremacy was fought and won . And those who most often tell us they do n't like it are those who benefit daily from its existence ; as Karl Marx , building his vision of a new world , was helped to keep body and soul together by Friedrich Engels , toiling here amid the immediacy of Lancashire grit and grime . These are the matters of Lowry 's paintings and drawings . He crowds his pictures with small human figures after the fashion of Brueghel , but how different is the emotional impact of a picture by Brueghel and of a picture by this faithful delineator and interpreter of the contemporary industrial scene ! A Brueghel picture always fills my heart with joy and hope at the infinite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? skating , shooting , working in the fields , walking down their village streets ? are distinct and individual . Each one has a quirk and a twist , a humor , something to cheer and enlighten his brief days under the sun . But Lowry refrains from bestowing upon his people any vestige of individuality . They are , almost always , flat silhouettes , moving against their drear background with the automatism of mechanic men . I know that in Lancashire you will find as much individuality as can be come by anywhere on . earth . It is a county that has thrown up more than its share of comedians and singers , artists and writers , to say nothing of many unknown men who are all compounded of wit and oddity . Was there not one Manchester business man who proceeded from home to office on roller skates , wearing a topper with the best of them ? Nevertheless , Lowry is right in depicting anonymous men , men without faces , men crushed and obliterated ; for thus he expresses with a sure instinct the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the machine as master . We have good reason today to know what the individual may hope for when matched against the machine . I am but an amateur and dabbler where pictures are concerned , and I am prepared to be told by the learned that my notions are nonsense . Nothing has ever surprised me more than to be asked to open an exhibition in the Manchester City Gallery , where so often I have beguiled an hour with beauty . The reason was a rather strange one . The invitation came from a man who had read my first novel , which has a painter for its chief character . He convinced himself that this painter was based upon observation of a well-known Manchester artist , and he argued that a man interested enough in a painter to make him a character in a novel would be interested enough in painting to assemble the few platitudes necessary for ' opening ' an exhibition . From the painter in my book he went on to deduce a whole gallery of Manchester identifications , thereby making me tremble with apprehension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no one in that book , there is no one in any book I have written , who is ' taken from life .

A man with any eye for the human comedy can not exist long in this world without being aware of fathomless resources of character and incident . There is an alphabet of passions and obsessions , fears and hopes , loves and hates , that can be endlessly combined , competently by most of us , and into startling new-minted form by the masters . True , there are those who lazily dip into their immediate shoals and eddies , with no refashioning , or too little ; and these arc they whom the voracious seize upon and wring through the mangle of the libel laws .

My morning newspaper , day after day , has letters from authors and clergymen and what not , all denouncing Mr. Wodehouse and some vowing never again to read his books . The whole hullaballoo seems to me to be nonsensical and wrong-headed . Naturally , we should all prefer that Mr. Wodehouse should do nothing to help our enemies ; but which of us can confidently declare what he would do with a revolver at his head or a knife at his neck ?

There I met him , waiting in the lounge , with those somewhat prominent front teeth , that wave of hair which then , towards the close of his life , was nearly white . He was well dressed , and there was something big , solid , and , above all , dignified in his appearance and bearing . I found him of an exquisite courtesy , treating a provincial reporter with a consideration that reporters do not always receive . We had tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading , of the plays and films he had been seeing ; and he talked sensibly , with no great-man assumptions , seeking my own opinions and receiving them as though they were worth listening to . After tea , he said he would like to walk about the town a little , and invited me to accompany him . We perambulated , he with a slow heavy dignity , for three quarters of an hour . Then he said that he was tired , and I saw him back to the door of his hotel . Nothing momentous had been said on either side ; but that brief contact remains curiously sharp in my memory . I have never before or since had so strongly the sense of being in the company of a man above the ruck of his fellows . How could either of us guess that afternoon that within a couple of years he would be dead and I should have succeeded him as the writer of the Evening Standard book page which he had made so famous ?
