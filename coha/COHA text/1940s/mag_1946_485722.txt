Here first the duties of today , the lessons of the concrete , Wealth , order , travel , shelter , products , plenty ; As of the building of some varied , vast , perpetual edifice , Whence to arise inevitable in time , the towering roofs , the lamps , The solid-planted spires tall shooting to the stars . S 0 WALT WHITMAN . But this original lover of Mannahatta does not translate too well . Else he .. et might have made some things clear to the delegates to the United Nations Assembly who recently decided to build their headquarters in a derelict area along the East River . He gives sounder advice than the delegates received from their technical commission of expert planners . Or from the daily papers . The best thing an editorial writer in the New York Times could find to say about this site was that it had plenty of rock under it . On the first page of the Times a more objective account noted the abattoirs , warehouses , parking lots , and Dead End kids : But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find on the site today . All that can be scraped clean . They are interested in getting down to the virgin rock and deciding what can be built there . Having accepted , on the recommendation of the United States government and with the cooperation of the city of New York , the East River site offered by John D. Rockefeller , where does the U. N. go from here ? The headquarters building must now be planned to accommodate all the U. N. 's many and varied activities . Only a Radio City type of development can fill the bill , a city of skyscrapers . But the U. N. city will stand within a city that already exists , and in one of the worst parts of the city . What limitations does this impose ? The site , offers no possibility of expansion ; and the U. N. , we hope , is to be a growing organization . The site is too small to give much opportunity for an architectural setting , and space 756 for many of the supporting services must be provided in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the French call donbielasce  --  the lack of a suitable atmosphere , a congenial environment . In our language we have neither the word nor the idea . The previous owners of this site , who assembled it with the idea of creating another and larger Radio City , appear to have relinquished their plan because the cooperation of the city was necessary not only to enable them to acquire some remaining small segments of property and to preempt space intended for a municipal park but to assure the construction of a loop subway line to the area . Quite a lot more will be expected of the city by the new owners . In the highly professional report of the Headquarters Commission we find an analysis of the U. N. 's requirements . The housing needs of the U. N. community are set off against a bleak and cheerless summary of New York 's housing situation . With 7,000 employees and their dependents , 4,000 transient visitors , and the necessary service population , this community is estimated to total 52,530 persons . On the five and one-half city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no such numbers can be accommodated . The employees of the U. N. , 40 per cent of whom earn less than $2,500 per year , will be fortunate if any housing is provided for them on or off the site , and the U. N. must begin to count on a permanent upward revision of the quota of American nationals it employs . The eighteen acres of land along the East River will meet only the barest requirements of the United Nations . The General Assembly must have a hall seating 1,000 persons with space for 3,000 more in balconies ; it must also have seven large committee rooms accommodating 400 persons , and ten smaller rooms for 30 to 100 persons . The Security Council will need its own chamber for 200 , with space for 2,000 in balconies , and with seven large and two or more small committee rooms . The Economic and Social Council and the Trusteeship Council will share a third hall seating 175 , with 500 in the balconies , two large committee rooms , and five small ones . Nine specialized international agencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2,500 , for which room must be provided . An estimated seventy permanent missions will have staffs totaling 1,875 persons . Offices for the secretariat itself form of course the largest item . These will require 1,675,000 square feet . Two small halls for lectures , films , and so on will require 15,000 square feet each . A library of a million volumes , various restaurants , bars , and lounges , and radio and communication facilities complete the main features of the plan . With Radio City in mind one need not doubt that this array of buildings can be erected on the chosen site . Some may even find encouragement in the fact that The NATION buildings so like their model will have a high degree of convertibility and a good resale value . Should the U. N. disintegrate , or be replaced by another and more effective form of world government , no embarrassing monument like that at Geneva need stand empty to remind us of our failure to create the Parliament of Man . Whether New York City can bring about a. sufficient measure of urban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site is an open question . Few city planners will take a cheerful view of the possibility . New York real estate , patticularly in Manhattan , is very sick . Despite the current false health of post-war conditions , it suffers from a chronic disease caused by ke widespread movement toward metropolitan decentralization and over-inflated realty values . U. N. delegates , most of whom come from cities a good deal smaller than Buffalo , whose administrations have a large measure of control over land , may be forgiven for miscalculating the importance of this factor . But our own representatives have a heavy responsibility . It is too early to say that we have sold the U. N. a gold brick . But it is beginning to look that way . Robert Moses apparently believes the U. N. will be satisfied if he rezones a fringe a block wide around the site . He can also be prevailed on , as a disciple of Baron Haussmann , to plan some monumental approaches to the U. N. headquarters . But corridor streets and pre facades are not enough . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly controlled ' building plans are called for . Fifteen years have passed since the last skyscraper of any consequence was built . The U. N. skyscrapers will undoubtedly be the last we shall erect . In what now seems an ironic proposal Lewis Mumford , our most distinguished student of architecture and city planning , recommended last summer that the United Nations select some portion of a great metropolis and redevelop it as an example for war-shattered cities . The distinguished French technical representative on the Headquarters Commission , M. Le Corbusier , has boldly championed the idea of the " vertical garden city " ? a skyscraper solution to the U. N. 's site problem . Are these brave conceptions to be mocked ? In constructing the **25;634;TOOLONG of U. N. the technical abilities of American architects and engineers will be put to the test . Building technicians of other nations can not seriously compete in manipulating this essentially American - building form : No other engineers are qualified by training or experience to deal with the complex questions of heating , ventilating , air conditioning , elevators , escalators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . The only architectural expression admissible will be a tight and economical functionalism not materially different from the rent barracks of Manhattan . The possibility of December 28 , 1946 an international architectural competition is an absurdity . Since American architects will inevitably determine the form of the buildings , the U. N. Headquarters Commis-sion might be well advised to place the design problem-in the hands of the Public Buildings Administration . The recently retired supervising architect of the PBA , George , - 1- lowe of Philadelphia , is admirably qualified for this .. c task by his experience in designing for the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society a skyscraper more modern than 757 any in New York . Or the PBA might make use of the experience of New York 's outstanding exponent of skyscraper design , Wallace K. Harrison , codesigner of Radio City , who has for months been at work on the development of this very East River area for Webb and Knapp . With such designers , and a determined effort on . the part of the New York City Planning Commission , it may yet be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a building that can speak to the world .
