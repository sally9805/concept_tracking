txt Amputation of the left leg was ' performed yesterday on Miss Olga Trapani , 28-year-old victim of the " camera-gun " shooting plot that reached its culmination on Tuesday morning with a shotgun burst on a crowded subway platform in Times Square . While Miss Trapani lay in Roosevelt Hospital in what physicians now termed a " critical " condition in a fight for life , her assailant , Miss Pearl Lusk , 19-yearold salesgirl , tearfully pleaded in General Sessions Court that it was 1 as the innocent dupe of Al Rocco , ' discarded husband of Miss Trapani , that she had fired the weapon in the belief it was a special camera I concealed in a gaily wrapped Christmas package . Shortly after 8 o'clock last night detectives al ; the West Thirtieth Street station , which is responsible for the investigation of the crime , ' disclosed that they were questioning there a Brooklyn taxicab driver who was described as an acquaintance of Rocco 's . They said the cab driver had told them he had not seen Rocco in " several months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's whereabouts . As the crime shifted from the bizarre to the tragic , police intensified their search for Rocco , whose criminal record on further study unfolded details of earlier brushes with the law that displayed ingenuity and cunning in a series of automobile thefts . Police maintained this bolstered their acceptance of the accusation that Rocco had masterminded the grotesquely clever scheme to inflict injury or death upon his former wife while she unsuspectingly walked the subway platform . Miss Trapani , whose left thigh was torn by the blasting pellets of a 12-gauge shotgun fired from a distance of three feet , spattering blood on Miss Lusk , was rushed to the hospital and her condition then was announced as - " critical . " On Wednesday it was given as " serious . " The operation was performed in the early afternoon and I she reportedly lapsed into a " critical " condition . The hospital au thorities declined to confirm or deny the operation had taken place , but police and prosecuting officials affirmed it . This was the second time Miss Trapani had been wounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by her to a vengeful and rebuffed former husband . On Nov. 1 , last , shortly after their marriage was annulled , she was wounded in almost the same spot by a shot fired through an open window while sitting in the kitchen of her home at 1434 Fifty-seventh Street , Brooklyn . A witness in the subway shooting reported he heard her say , " Well , he got me this time . If he wants me now he can take me . I 'm crippled . " During Miss Trapani 's confinement to the hospital police have taken precautions against Rocco 's making another attempt on her life by assigning a continuous guard at her bedside , consisting of a uniformed patrolman and a policewoman . Asks Court Hold Girl Jacob Grumet , assistant District Attorney in charge of the Homicide Bureau , brought Miss Lusk into General Sessions Court before Judge Francis L. Valente on an application that she be committed as a material witness in the case of the People versus John Doe . Police had indicated that they doubted criminal intent could be proved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case to the court , asserted his belief that Miss Lusk was " cooperative " and " telling the truth " and then denounced the fugitive Rocco as an " arch fiend . " Police already had labeled Rocco as a " diabolical genius . " ' Judge Valente set bail at $10,000 and directed that Miss Lusk be continued in custody at the Florence Crittenton Home , 307 East Twelfth Street , under the sur ervision of Miss Rachel Newlin , ** of the home , who accompanied Miss Lusk to court . Judge Valente stressed to Miss Lusk that she was not a prisoner in the home on any charge and directed that she be brought any of her clothing or personal effects she wished to have . Sobbing loudly , Miss Lusk , who has said over and over again to her interrogators , " How could I have been so stupid ? " declared in court , " The only thing that I can say is that I knew nothing about this ; I had no idea that this woman was his wife ; I never knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and was seated on a front bench with Miss Newlin while the court papers were drawn up . A study of Bronx County Court records disclosed that Rocco , who police said was sentenced to a year in jail on grand larceny charges on June 21 , 1938 , had been arraigned as Alphonse Ruocco , alias Al Rocco , alias Frank Olivia . He was sentenced as Al Rocco . A. Bellevue Hospital report in connection with the case described Rocco as a man of " average intelligence , not insane and not mentally defective . " The records showed that he was accused of stealing an automobile from Schmidt 's garage at 46/ East 189th Street , the Bronx , next door to a garage where he worked as a handy man for $10 a week and slept on the premises . It was reported he sold the car to a relative for $500 , but the relative was short of cash and Rocco accepted a $50 deposit . Alleged Confession Reported According to the court papers , Rocco " confessed " to a relative , who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all and that he employed an ingenious ruse whereby he purchased a set of license plates in the name of Frank Olivia and altered automoa bile registration forms to conform with the plates he possessed , on several occasions boldly accompanying purchasers of his stolen cars to the registration bureau for the transaction . Mr. Grumet and the police discounted yesterday the likelihood that the young men who disrobed on the beach near Coney Island Wednesday morning and swam out to sea was Rocco . They had investigated the possibility as a " shot in the dark " as the swimmer 's physical description tallied with that of Rocco . The clothing left on the beach was not identified by any of the principals in the case . Police were still checking every angle of Miss Lusk 's story that she knew Rocco as Allen Larue and that he told her he was an insurance adjuster trailing " stolen jewels " that were being carried by his former wife under her clothing .
