MEGSY A Story MURRAY DYER T o-nAv I heard the latest story of " Megsy " Winthrop . To understand it you have to know some of the earlier ones . To begin with , " Megsy " was not always his name . On the night of the last day of our first term at the School he was still just Winthrop . We were in the dormitory getting ready for bed , Winthrop , Armitage , and myself . We were the new boys in the dormitory that term . So on this first " last " night we naturally drew together , not knowing that links stronger than steel were being forged . In our cars still rang the School Song . It almost seemed as though we could still hear the thunder of the chorus as the school sang it : What though the world 's three corners led by all the powers of Night , Come against us in their fury we shall shock them left and right , For the Chieftains stand a-watching by the Way . We were to hear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fifteen times in the next five years . On the last day of every term it was always sung in the Big Schoolroom , a room hung with the shields on which were inscribed the university honors of those who had gone before us  --  a room in which on nearly every desk was a name carved surreptitiously with a penknife and which afterward was famous . The first time you heard that song as a new hoy you knew it was something very important , although you never could have explained why . The last time you heard it , the night before you left , after your course through the School had been run , it was with a vow . After the School Song everyone went to the dormitories . There on each bed was a copy of the school magazine with its record of the term just ended . On the last pages were two lists of names . The first list , under the heading " Salvete , " was the list of new boys . That night in our dormitory Winthrop , Armitage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stark record of our entry : " Salvete : Charles Edward Armitage Harold Mortimer Winthrop . " And my own name . There were other names too of course , but we three had landed in the same dormitory . Farther on down the page was another heading : " Valete . " And in this list were the names of those who were leaving , together with a record of the things they had done for the School . Leading the list was the name Kyle . Arthur Wyndham Kyle . And after the dates of his birth , admission , and leaving : Captain of the School ; Captain of Games ; Captain of the Eleven ; Captain of the Fifteen ; Prefect ; Company Sergeant Major , Officers ' Training Corps ; First-class shot ; Secretary , Debating Society ; Secretary , Musical Society ; Curator , Field Club ; Conyngsby Scholar ; Mathematical Scholarship , St. Catherine 's College , Cambridge . . The list went on , fourteen lines of it in small type . Each of us read it and looked without comment at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a few minutes he would order lights out and go down to join the company of Old Boys who always returned at the end of the summer term . Kyle had run his course well . There were other names of course , each with its list of honors won , records broken , and scholarship achieved . On that night the three of us , new boys , were very small fry indeed . Winthrop did not receive the nickname which was to stick with him closer than a brother until the next term . He was christened in the Big Schoolroom one wet , windy afternoon with a southeaster rattling the window panes , driving against them stinging drops of salt-laden water from off the Channel . Several of us had been sitting on the radiator for warmth in the absence of any seniors . We thought we were committing to memory seventy lines of The Lady of the Lake , a weekly task . Actually we were listening to Winthrop defending Little Women . It was probably the first time in the history of the School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the names which gleamed on the shields in the gloom . There was something of sacrilege about it . Little Women  --  a girls ' book . And not only mentioned but discussed in a room where men like Shelby , who played cricket for England , had sat ; where men like Wilkinson , who had his Blue for Rugger , had swotted ; where men like Paget , who had won a V. C. in the first World War , had read the Strand during prep , tucking it conveniently inside the covers of a school Bible . Yet we had to listen because Winthrop knew , even then , what he was talking about . The character of Meg occupied him chiefly . He knew exactly what she was like . For one thing she was like his sister . An admission you simply did n't make , even if true , which we doubted , because Winthrop was a gentleman , and so was his father . What was worse his father was a famous explorer who would , we were sure , have been as shocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an American woman , probably half Indian . We listencd in stunned , pained , yet fascin , s , silence . Those of us who heard hint knew beyond doubt that he understood what was talking about . What was worse he made it interesting . He sat on the radio for pipe , his bony knees hunched up to h. : chin , his dark , nearly black hair , un ? combed , falling across his spectacle ; Much of the time he was talking his wide mobile mouth kept breaking into an wet . tious grin , sometimes even a wild , gyp rattling laugh which was not like the hon. est guffaw of , say , Armitage . He finished his argument and looked round at tu . Not one of us dared admit we had been forced to listen . His eyes , brown and lively , snapped behind the lenses of his glasses . " I wish I 'd met Meg , " he finished . " She could probably tell me why my sister went to Bedales instead of Sherborne . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet infectious laugh that had a lilt in it . Armitage yawned loudly . Then he got up slowly , stretched himself , and said , " Well , Megsy , what about the Lady of the Lake ? Have you got another sister like her ? " We laughed loudly and ribaldly to cover our feelings . " Megsy , " we shouted with delight ? " Megsy . " And Winthrop was christened , even as the door burst open and crashed back against its stop with a bang as a crowd of seniors came pouring in from the Changing Room . With the acquisition of his nickname , Megsy 's character at school began to take on shape . It began to be clear that he was one of those who could never be made part of the Pattern . By the same token , therefore , he could never become an accepted leader . Nevertheless he had qualities of his own which compelled respect . In his field , for instance , English and later English literature and history , he was supreme . At weekly Repetition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Old Man to repeat from memory the lines set for the week , Megsy was never stumped . Start him in the middle of the line and he would finish it , and sometimes , taking the bit in his teeth , he would go on beyond the ten lines allotted d roll out the cadences of Scott with a : 6 ? ish that to us , bred to the tradition that only girls like poetry , was allied to indecent exposure . He was forgiven only because at times he made up for it by comments outside the scope of the prescribed courses . As when , for instance , in the Upper fifth , during a course on Wordsworth he discovered with delight the lines to " The Green Linnet , " which he promptly retitled " The Green Limit . " After our shout of approval had died down , Paton , the English master , demanded of him as penance a lucid exposition of his views on Wordsworth as a major poet . Megsy took ten minutes to give them . And as usual , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but well-annotated comment ending with some pointed sentences concerning the influence of Wordsworth 's love affair in France upon his later development . Two minutes after he started , the corners of Paton 's mouth began to twitch and his hand went up to his mustache to cover the evident sign of his amusement . Paton listened in silence , then , when Megsy had finished , looked at him as one equal to another and said : " 0 cuckoo , shall I call thee girl , or but a wandering voice ? " The reading Paton gave to the line , his delicate underscoring of the word " cuckoo , " and his allusion to Winthrop 's nickname brought forth a burst of laughter , led by Megsy 's own half-apologetic , foolish , lilting laugh . Before this sort of incident could happen , however , Megsy had some heavy going to weather . In his early days at the School he was , because so obviously a nonconformist , always in danger of becoming a butt . There was for example the night when all of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Pilkington , late of the Coldstream Guards . Tired of the army , Pilkington had left it and taken to teaching . What he taught nobody seemed to know . He was down to teach simple mathematics to the lower forms . But there is no record that any of us who went through those forms ever discovered that he did . On this particular night wiegsy put up his hand and said : " Please , 1k ' , may I leave the room ? " There was only one reason for wanting to leave the room during prep but Pilkington evidently wanted it labeled . So he asked , " Why ? " " I want to go across the yard , sir , " said Megsy . If pressed this was the standard euphemism , since the School 's plumbing facilities were , literally , across the yard . But Pilkington had not been at the School long enough to appreciate this , so he repeated : " Across the yard ! Why do you want to go across the yard ? " By this time no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Megsy . " I just want to go across the yard , sir , " said Megsy uncomfortably . " Why across the yard ? " said Pilkington , puzzled . " What 's across the yard ? What do you expect to see ? " There was a roar of laughter and Armitage put up his hand . " We all have to go across the yard , sir , " he explained , an all-but-imperceptible tone of contempt in his voice . " It 's the way they built the School . " Suddenly it dawned on Pilkington and he grew red in the face . To cover his confusion he got up , put his hands in his pockets and said : " Oh , yes ! Yes of course ! Across the yard ! By all means . How interesting ! " This would have happened of course to whoever first put up his hand with the request . But , as the years went on , it seemed that it was always Megsy 's fate to be the first to put up his hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a touch of scorn , that Megsy 's requests were entirely proper . You might make fun of Megsy and often did . ' But you did not make fun of Armitage . And if Armitage ruled that what Megsy said or did was all right that ended it . A strange relationship was slowly growing up between Megsy and Armitage . Armitage already was showing signs of the course he would run . He would finish as a brilliant example of the Pattern at its best . Level-headed , direct , sure of the validity of the tradition to which he belonged , he was marked as a coming man and he could have had the friendship of anyone in the School . Instead , he stuck to Megsy ; with resignation , with amusement , with now and then distinct irritation . But still he stuck . He had other friends too of course . But Megsy knew him best . And on the rare occasions when Armitage opened his mouth about anything , Megsy knew about it first . Nobody could understand this , least of all Megsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loyalty , even though , while he was at the School , he never quite learned why he could be so irritating . There was , for instance , the night when the three of us were in the sick room , recovering from bad colds . We were in fact practically well . It was June . That night we had gone to sleep at lights-out quickly and efficiently as healthy young animals will . But the energy stored up by a week in bed made us sleep lightly , so at three in the morning we woke when a car door slammed outside . We heard a deep voice say " goodnight . " It was Mackenzie , the Senior Master , returning from a Masonic dinner . We got up and went to the window and then , seeing the beauty of the morning , we stayed , leaning on our arms , looking out . We had been at the School long enough by this time to have absorbed the things it had to give that made it ours . One of those things was the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chieftains stand a-watching by the Way . That Way was the ken Way , the old Roman road that began in Dorset and wound over hills and across valleys to London . A part of it ran through the School , and gave us a deep and abiding sense of continuity . By leaning well out of the window and looking to the left , we could see where , seven miles away , the Way climbed the Ridgeway hill . It was an abandoned road up the hill . Later engineers had veered from its uncompromising and direct course straight up , to build a highway that climbed in curves a horse and van could negotiate more easily . Yet still the white chalk gash in the hill persisted , so well and truly built by the Romans that even time had not been able to cover their handiwork . Hard by the Way , and running along the summit of the downs that fell away to the southeast , was a line of barrows , burial mounds of Stone Age chieftains who once lived in Dorset . Winter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That morning as we leaned out of the window the world we saw was very beautiful . We heard the whisper of the Channel tide rolling lazily up the beach . We saw the lavender that bordered the old stone walk that led to the labs . Far off was the moor , misty now in the summer dawn . Beyond , perched on a cliff ledge above the sea , stood the Coast Guard cottages . Behind it all the downs . The sun was not yet up , but the old horse that pulled the mowing machine around the cricket field was having his breakfast , quietly munching away in the corner where he was staked . We said nothing , even after we had seen Mackenzie let himself into the main building . Then suddenly Mcgsy spoke : 0 we speak not overmuch Of the strange things we have seen ; Our eyes were nut for such Over-keen . The fairest thing we knew In a land of gaudy flowers , Was a daisy tipped with dew , English , ours . It was Armitage who turned slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Back into bed , Daisy . This was worth getting up for until you thought of that nonsense . " Not for a good many years would Megsy admit that he had spoiled that dawn , not so much by having read those atrocious lines as by being young enough to remember and quote them . By the time another spring had come we were old enough to appreciate the moor . It was a wonderful place . Summer migrants and birds of many kinds nested in it . Plovers , herons , owls , reed warblers , swans . Collecting eggs was a hobby most of the school took up at one time or another . To pursue it well called for an intimate acquaintance with the vast , uncertain , watery stretches of the moor . Across it diagonally ran an old cart track . Crisscrossing it ran dykes . Here and there , on patches of firm ground , copses flourished . It was in the copses that the herons nested . It was in the wild tough grasses of the open stretches that the plovers laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When plovers see anyone coming they get off their nests and run through the grass before they rise into the air . Their nests are never where you see them get up . All the while you are in the vicinity they circle above , crying mournfully . But when you actually come within a few feet of their nests the cry changes to an almost heartrending sob . When you hear that change you know that you must look carefully , that you must pass no tuft of grass by without looking under it . It was a rule that no nest must be broken up . Only one egg could be taken . Since plovers lay clutches of four , that meant three for the mother to come back to . Grossing the moor in spring was an art . The dykes were swollen , the cart track hidden , and the level stretches covered with the overflow from the rains . Large expanses gleamed blue in the April sunshine , dotted with green shining tufts of turf . Gradually you came to know these tufts . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used as stepping stones , but they sank beneath you if you paused on them . Still others were delusions nothing but green fronds of grass floating on water . On these , if you stepped , you sank at once into cold , mold-colored water , in places up to your neck . For this reason those who went out to collect eggs always wore running clothes : a shirt , shorts , and rubber shoes , and carried a bag for the eggs . Those who knew the moor best could roam across it at will , never getting wet above the ankles , so thoroughly had they absorbed their knowledge of the dykes and various tufts . Megsy was one of these . It was about this time that a law was passed making it illegal to collect eggs of summer migrants . A conservation measure that was undoubtedly good ; nevertheless the School sent up a howl , for the moor had been considered school property . What matter that the law was meant to apply to the whole of England and not just to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a provision allowing eggs to be collected for museums and bona fide field clubs under proper supervision , and the School had a field club . Inevitably there was some poaching . It was the duty of the local constabulary to prevent this . Obviously if a boy was caught coming off the moor with half a dozen eggs of onespecies , he had taken more , far more , than the field club needed . He therefore was liable for a trip to the magistrate 's court and a fine of one pound sterling for each egg , charged to his father on the bill at the end of the term . It was of course a point of honor not to abuse the privilege of egg-collecting on the moor . however abusing the local constabulary was quite another matter . And after the heavily uniformed members of this force had stopped several boys corning off the moor , and examined their bags instead of merely taking their word , it was felt that the value of a gentleman 's honor was being called in question . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policeman waiting on solid ground near where you were coming off the moor you merely returned into the watery wastes , picked your way quickly across the grass , and came off a mile farther up . The police genially let it be known they could handle this problem . Their men would come into the moor after their quarry . Unfortunately they were heavily laden and their boots and uniforms were not adapted to a fast , one-hundred-yard sprint over sinking tufts of grass . To say nothing of the fact that those who knew the moor like Megsy invariably led them into the center of a watery waste where one misstep meant immersion , and then , since that misstep was always forthcoming , stood by and offered comment on the stupidity of policemen trying to collect eggs when in uniform . " If you want to collect eggs , " Megsy one day told a constable floundering in water up to his middle , " you ought to dress as we do . Now you 'll have to walk home with all those wet , heavy clothes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you realty want to collect eggs why do n't you let me do it for you ? " Human nature being what it is , of course the constable , after his bath , first explained just what he proposed to do when he caught his quarry , overlooking the handicap of boots and sodden uniform against running clothes . Eventually , in return for being led safely out of the moor , he promised to refrain from any laying on of hands , but never would he promise not to look inside the bag . And always when dry land was reached he solemnly inspected the eggs collected to see if there had been any violation . There was never any question of running away before that inspection was made . Anyone who did that would have been taken down by the whole school to the constable concerned . It was simply a game which the constabulary seemed to like to play with the School during the spring term . However it was bound to pall on them in time . In fact it palled the minute one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thereafter policemen rode round the moor on bicycles and watched the egg-collecting through glasses . It was Megsy who discovered how to play this game out . He would simply make sure he was being watched , then bend over a nest and pretend to take all the eggs and transfer them to his bag . When a complaint came in to the School , Megsy 's innocence was outraged . " No , of course I never took more than one . . . he could n't have seen me . . I picked up several to see which one had the best markings . . . " But it was no good . The Old Man had the last word . Law and order had to be upheld . And besides , the Old Man was renowned for being able to see through brick walls . " Well , Winthrop , what have you to say about this complaint ? " " Well , sir , I thought . . " " Ah . . . I see . You thought . Winthrop , there are two rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , sir . " " One is to think . The other is not to think . The difficulty , my dear Winthrop , is to know when to apply them . I 'm going to cane you . " " Me , sir ? " Megsy 's tone was both complimentary and chagrined . The only thing he had overlOoked was the Old Man 's well-known ability to solve knotty problems . " Yes . Bring that chair over and kneel up , will you ? " " But , sir . . " " Winthrop , " the Old Man 's tone was crisp , " would you rather I caned you or put the moor out of bounds to you for the rest of the term ? " Megsy was caned while we , our ears glued to the keyhole , counted the strokes . Eventually the day came when Megsy had to be made a school prefect . He was in his last year now at the School . It was dangerous of course . After all , Megsy had not conformed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He would do brilliantly at Cambridge . But as a prefect the School would never do more than tolerate him . Would he be able to keep order ? The Old Man must have spent an anxious week making up his mind , but in the end he put up the notice which announced that Megsy henceforth was one of the elect . Characteristically he then took his hands off the reins and gave Megsy his head . Although nearly five years had passed since that winter term when Megsy first came to the School he had changed little . He was taller and no longer wore glasses but his hair was still wild and unruly , and if anything he looked more loosely knit and disjointed than ever . Still he had made the Rugby Football Fifteen . That helped . Among other duties which prefects performed was the taking of morning prep before breakfast . And new prefects dreaded the first time . On how they got through it depended in no small measure the degree of authority they wielded thereafter . If the School thought it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on first mornings . The morning Megsy took it the School was quiet . Everyone was at his desk . There was not a murmur . This was more ominous than if there had been muttering and shuffling . Megsy came through the big door , in his usual hurrying walk . His hair was tousled , his tie carelessly put on , his collar crumpled . He walked up to the desk to call the roll . On the desk was a hat . Megsy did just what the School had banked on his doing . Instead of calling one of the boys over to put it away he picked it up himself . Under it , neatly arranged , were a pair of military hair brushes , a comb , and a bottle of brilliantine . The School laughed . With the hat in his hand Mcgsy looked up uncertainly . And the laugh swelled to a roar . Then the shuffle started . Every foot in the room began to rub backward and forward under the desks . Someone thought of opening a desk lid and letting it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fell with a thunderclap . The uproar now was so terrible that no voice could have been heard above it . And there , on the dais , facing the School , stood Megsy , the hat still in his hand , his face set and unsmiling as he faced them steadily , but not knowing what to do to stop it . It was at this moment that the door banged open as it had that day five years ago when Megsy had been christened . Only this time , instead of a crowd pouring in , only Armitage stood there , his face like a thundercloud . So heavy had been the crash as he threw back the door that even over the uproar the School heard it and turned to see who it was . One look at Armitage was enough . Armitage was now Head Prefect , Captain of Games , Captain of the Fifteen , and Head of the School . And he was obviously angry . Very angry . You did n't argue with Armitage when he was angry . As though a wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then to absolute silence . Slowly Armitage looked round the room , then finally up at the dais where Megsy stood , the hat still in his hand . He took it all in . Then he began to walk up to Megsy . Looking at him you could not tell what he was thinking . Halfway to the desk he spoke . " Winthrop " ? his tone was friendly , warm ? " I came in to ask you something about Rugger next term . Would you mind letting the roll go this morning ? " " Of course , " said Megsy . And he signed for the door to be closed , signal that prep was to begin . " Thanks , " Armitage said , and he leaned over the desk , dropping his voice so that all you could hear was a murmur . For five minutes he stayed . And by the time he left , the School remembered what it had forgotten  --  Megsy and Armitage were friends . It was inexplicable , but there it was . And Armitage was a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the School could put up with him , too . Back in his study , Armitage raged to the three of us who shared it with him . " I never saw such a bloody fool , " he stormed . " Standing there with that damned hat in his hand , looking at those hair brushes as if he expected them to bite . I might have known something like that would happen . " He might have added that it was only because he knew so well it would happen that he 'd taken the trouble to be on hand that morning to back Megsy up . However if you had said that , Armitage would have laughed in your face and said that he did n't give a damn for Megsy . It was the prestige and authority of his position as a prefect that were at stake . Megsy wrote his last page at the School as he had his first  --  with Armitage . It was the last day of the winter term and the Rugby football match against the Old Boys was nearly over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold and raw , gray clouds hanging low over the field . Huddled in overcoats , the School thronged the touch lines . It was a close game , very close . For more than three-quarters of an hour now neither side had scored . And the ball was in enemy territory . Suddenly one of the opposing forwards got the ball at his feet and started to dribble . " Fall on it . . fall on it , " shouted Armitage . Megsy was running across and hesitated . And the chance to stop the movement was lost . The ball was picked up and whipped along the threequarter line to Stratton , wing three-quarter for Cambridge and reputed to be the fastest man with a ball in England . Already Stratton had it and was moving down the touch line toward the School goal posts . So sudden and clean-cut had been the movement that no one stood between him and the goal line . A groan went up from the School .. Nothing could stop Stratton now ; all he had to do was run down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diagonally was Armitage . Both men had about the same distance to run to where their paths would intercept . Armitage , fast though he was , could never hope to beat Stratton , yet Armitage kept coming . There was silence and immobility over that whole field now except for the two pounding figures of Stratton and Armitage . Stratton was still a yard to the good  --  he flashed by and was ahead  --  the School groaned  --  and then the groan changed to a shout . Even as Stratton passed him , Armitage had plunged , his left arm had shot out , groped , gripped and hung on to Stratton 's ankle . With a thud that was heard all over the field , Stratton was down . Armitage was first on his feet . Stratton had been winded slightly and the ball wrenched from his grasp by the fall . It rolled into touch so it was the School 's ball . Armitage had it . As though a button had been pressed the field was in motion again . In the forefront of the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant flash of recognition between him and Armitage . Armitage drew back his arm and threw in the ball . " Take it with you , " he roared and the bail spun up into the air to drop toward Megsy . Megsy leaped ; his loosely knit arms seized the ball ; in that strung-out formation there was no weight ready to stop him . He burst through the enemy forwards as Armitage shouted again : " At your feet . . . at your feet , Megsy . Bunch and push him through . " The one advantage the School had over the Old Boys was that it had played as a team . Now at Armitage 's words it functioned as a team . Megsy had the ball at his feet and was dribbling it down the field . Behind him were the forwards , giving the Old Boys no time to get in front and block the dribble . Armitage 's tackle and Megsy 's dribble will live in the memory of all who saw that game that day . For eighty yards Megsy dribbled so well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who fell and tried to stop him found he had fallen too late . Twenty yards from the goal line Armitage yelled again , yelled as Potter , the opposing fullback , came in to fall . " Kick it , Megsy , " yelled Armitage , " kick it on . " And Megsy kicked , kicked it by Potter even as Armitage came rushing up from behind to gather it in one swift , graceful sweep of his arm and race over the line to score . In the thunder that rose from the field Armitage and Megsy signed their names to their day at the School . They hadcrossed all their t 's and dotted the final i 's . It was a superb Valete and a promising Salvetc for their to-morrow . That evening in the Big Schoolroom they sang for the last time as members of the School the song that closed each term . The chorus thundered into the night and was lost in century-old echoes along the Way . . What though the world 's three corners , led by all the powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock them left and right For the Chieftains stand a-watching by the Way . Few if any foresaw how soon and almost literally the world 's three corners would be coming in fury and that in truth they would be shocked  --  in the air , on the ground , and upon the sea . In the New Year Megsy went up to Cambridge . Armitage went into the army . More than a year passed before they met again . When they did it was in a pub over a beer . There had been a dinner in London and several of us had met at it . We had gone to the pub afterward . There was a show running on the stage at the time which was very popular . In the last act the chorus shook off its garments and danced as nearly unclad as the censor would permit . Minders , always a rather unpleasant person , had seen it only three nights before . He was still licking his lips over the final act . Although we had all seen it too , he insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " I must say it bores me to sit and watch women taking off their clothes . I know quite well how to do that sort of thing myself without having to be shown in public . " Megsy laughed , the same foolish laugh . Nettled , Minders remarked , " Well , it does n't bore me . I like it . " " You seem to , " said Winthrop . And Minders , angry , retorted , " Well , what do you expect after having been cooped up in a monastery for five years . Have you ever slept with a woman , Megsy ? " If it had been anyone else but Mcgsy the question would have been ignored . But Megsy had never learned what things not to talk about and that night he was mellow . He looked round at us , a foam-ing tankard in front of him . He was slouched down in his seat so that only his eyes gleamed over the foam . " No , " Megsy answered , " I have n't , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Armitage . " Thought about it ! " said Minders in scorn . " It was in Portsmouth , " said Megsy reminiscently . " One of those places on the way to the Dockyard , I suppose , " said Armitage carelessly . " Yes . I heard about it from a friend of mine . He said you could go in and for a shilling an article the girls would undress for you . " " Did you go in ? " asked Minders . And his pornographic little mind was already busily at work . " Yes , " said Megsy , laughing foolishly again , " but I did n't stay . I took one look and slapped five bob on the table and ran . " " But what excuse did you give ? " asked Armitage . " After all , you had to tell her something . " Mcgsy put down his tankard and looked round at all of us . " I just said : ' I do n't like your shape . " ' The group burst into a roar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? We leaned back and guffawed . Megsy was priceless . Now I come to the latest story of Megsy . When the war came he was an English master but he immediately offered his services . Since his father had been very well known , not only for his scientific explorations but also as a big-game hunter in Africa , and since Megsy himself had spent many of his holidays in Africa as well as his early life , he found , somewhat to his surprise , that he was roped in by Intelligence and sent to Cairo . For a long time he languished there , polishing up his Arabic and making friends on his own account with men who had known his father . Meanwhile the traditional mills of the gods went to work . In London a group of men discussed D.C. The letters stood for de Chamber-tin , who had a villa outside Algiers . " You see , " one of them said , " if only we knew D.C. was behind us , we could take the risk . " " Why do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second member of the group suggested . The rest laughed . " D.C. " said the first speaker , " is first of all French . He would do nothing unless he knew precisely what cards we were giving him to hold . If we told him that , and he refused , the job 's finished before it begins . I think he 's with us . But I 'm not sure . " " He used to he a friend of Winthrop 's . " The man who spoke was tanned and spare , and his uniform looked as if it had been in the same sort of weather that had darkened his face . " I thought of that , " was the reply . " Unfortunately , Winthrop 's dead . " " On the other hand , D.C. is a man , we know , who stands by his friends . And he 's cosmopolitan . " " No Frenchman is cosmopolitan . He 's French first . " " Perhaps . " The man in uniform was very sure of himself . " But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once that for a friend  --  a real friend  --  D.C. would do anything , go anywhere , keep any confidence . " " Well , " said the first speaker again , and this time shortly , " Winthrop 's dead . And we do n't believe in miracles . " " He had a son , I believe . . " The man in uniform looked round the group . " Well ? " The question was almost a challenge . " For the son of his best friend D.C. might do a great deal . " " It would mean telling the son everything . That might be worse than the risk of going to D.C. direct . " " It might . But we could find out . If we can trust the boy  --  he must be a man by now  --  D.C. would see him for his father 's sake . " " That still does n't answer what we 're to do if D.C. says no . " " D.C. would be told only if he agreed either way to keep quiet . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might , for the sake of Alan Winthrop . " The first speaker leaned forward over his desk and looked hard at the man in uniform . " Do you know something snore than you 're telling us , Gregory , that makes you so sure ? " " Yes , " Gregory Havant answered . " I do . It 's a good risk . " " Very well . " And the order he got was : " Find Winthrop 's son . " So the wheels were set in motion and the search protracted until at last , as is the way , aftcr a great deal of looking in far places Megsy 's name was discovered in the files two floors below the office where Havant had sat , and two doors down the corridor . Some weeks later , at the Semiramis Hotel in Cairo , Havant and Armitage sat waiting . " The man you 're going to be responsible for , " Havant was saying , " will be all right , I think . We 've had to tell him everything ; as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been coached and trained in every detail . We could n't put it on paper . He 's had to commit it to memory . He 's not even to talk to you about it . And you 're not to question him . You have purposely been kept in the dark about this and you 're to remain in the dark . When you get to D.C. you 're to stay with him only until you know whether de Chambertin will agree to hear what we want to tell him . If he will you 're to leave the two of them alone . The reason 's obvious in view of what I 've told you previously . " There was a knock at the door . Havant said , " Here he comes now . " And in walked Winthrop . Armitage stood up . " Megsy , " he said . And then again : " Megsy ! Good God , it would have to be you . " Havant looked at them . " You know each other ? " " We were at school together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just now that you thought the man I was to take in would be all right . I can tell you now that whatever you 've told him is safe . At the same time , sir , in view of the orders you 've given me , I must ask if I can be relieved of the responsibility of accompanying him . " Gregory Havant looked perplexed . " You were at school together ? " he repeated . " Yes , " Armitage said . Winthrop looked puzzled as he stood waiting . His hair , Armitage said later , was still asdisgraceful as ever and his uniform looked as though he 'd slept in it for a week . For a time Havant looked out of the window at the Nile and across to the Pyramids . Finally he spoke . " I understand perfectly , Armitage , why you want to be relieved . It 's very proper . Under normal circumstances you would have to be relieved . There is not time now , however , to replace you . I do not think the action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But if it does you have your orders . You must carry them out . You will both leave to-night from Alexandria . " " Very good , sir , " Armitage answered . There was nothing else he could say . " Winthrop . " Havant looked at Megsy , who saluted . " There 's just one final question . How , when you get to D.C. , can you be sure he 'll see you ? You said you 'd be able to work that out by this afternoon . Have you ? " " Yes , sir , " Megsy replied . " All I have to say is : ' The son of the man who stood with you at sunset on the rocks above Abu Simbel wants to see you . ' " " And he 'll see you ? " Havant smiled . " Yes , sir , " said Megsy . " He 'll see me . " " Interesting , " Havant muttered . " I knew I was right that day in London . Can you tell me what that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I will when I come back , sir . I 'd rather not now . " " Very good , " Havant said . " When you come back will do . And good luck to both of you . " This is how it came about that several nights later a submarine nosed quietly to the surface in the Mediterranean off the coast just west of Algiers . Armitage and Winthrop were dressed like Arabs . " Remember , " the submarine captain said , as he prepared to put them ashore , " for the next three nights be here waiting for you . All you have to do is signal and I 'll send a boat in and pick you up . " When dawn came , Armitage and Megsy stood outside the villa where de Charnbertin lived . Behind them the cultivated plain reached to the Mediterranean . It was already hot on that plain . But as they Waited outside the villa after Megsy had sent in his message , a breeze came down off the mountains and cool , green , inviting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the plain . Less than an hour later several shots cracked in the stillness . Almost immediately Armitage galloped alone out through the gateway and headed for the mountains . What happened during that hour he told me one night months later in New York . Steel-ribbed and armor-plated as he was , I think Armitage was glad to tell me . It was a confession . Although he knew he had carried out his orders , still he had to put in words to someone what those orders had been and why he had left the villa alone . Here is the story of that hour as Armitage told it . Both he and Megsy were taken directly to D.C. as soon as Winthrop sent in his message . De Chambertin , dressed in riding clothes , was in the gun-room , a cool , low , stone-floored room which faced the mountains . It opened onto a terrace . D.C. 's first words were a surprise and an unpleasant shock . " I have been waiting for you , " he said . " And , " Armitage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew something had gone wrong somewhere . There had been a leak , and I did n't like it . " De Chambertin was a magnificent-looking specimen  --  tall , weather-beaten , quiet . Coffee was brought in and , after that one disturbing greeting , D.C. did not speak for some time . He looked uncomfortable , as if he had something on his mind . Then he walked over to one of his gun cases . He 'd been studying Mcgsy for some minutes . " You have your father 's sensitivity , " he said to Megsy as he opened the glass door . " I can see that . But I do not think you have his love for danger . Although that is not important so long as a man handles himself well when danger is present . " He took out a gun which he lifted carefully and obviously with affection . Automatically he broke the breech before passing it to Megsy . " This is the gun I was holding , " lie continued , " that night at sunseton the rocks above Abu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night he gave it to me . " Megsy took it , held it for a few moments , then passed it over to Armitage . " You know more about guns than I do , " he said , " but I know this : you 'll never handle a finer piece of work . " He turned to de Chambertin . " Sir , " he said , " you spoke as if you knew of my coming . . . " D.C. interrupted him . " My son , I knew someone was coming from the English . I did not know who it would be . But I might perhaps have guessed , for the English are careful at times like this . And since you are here I will guess again . Gregory Havant , I think , is the man who thought of you . " Armitage looked up at de Chambertin but he and Megsy were standing as if they were the only people in the room . " Gregory Havant is the man , " Megsy answered , " but I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for anything less than my country . And , in the long run , for your country . If I tell you why I am here will you keep all that I say to yourself , whether your answer is yes or no ? " There was the stamp of boots outside on the terrace and two men walked into the room with revolvers in their hands . " It is too late , " D.C. said sadly and in heavy tones . " Too late . " Looking at the three of them , the senior German officer bowed stiffly and put his revolver back in its holster . " You are my prisoners , " he said , bowing again to Megsy and to Armitage , " but there is no need to hurry . You may finish your coffee . " Turning to de Chambertin he said , " You have done well for France to-day . " What followed Armitage told me tonelessly , in staccato sentences , speaking like a man who is cutting from his mind , one by one , the straps that bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the thing Ilavant had sent me to stop . Megsy knew too much to become a prisoner . I shot him . Those were my orders . When Havant gave them to me in Cairo he said the Germans now had a drug which made you tell everything you knew . That was why I had to know nothing , and why someone had to cover the man who knew everything . Then I shot at the Germans . But I was running through them for the door when I fired . I had to get back to tell Havant . Those were my second orders . " I had seen de Chambertin 's horse in the courtyard when we came in . I jumped on it and galloped . I picked up the submarine the third night " For a long time there was nothing to say . Then , because one of us had to speak , I said : " So the plan failed . Havant was wrong about de Charnbertin . " Armitage looked up . " No , " he answered . " No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in touch with him later . Megsy 's death in his own gun-room hid hit himpretty hard . He sent Havant a message : For my friend , and the son of my friend , who also knew how to gamble , I will listen to what you want to tell me . ' " " And the rocks at Abu Simbel ? " I asked . I could n't help it although it did n't really seem important just then . Armitage , his voice once more normal , took up the question matter-of-factly , as if it had no connection with Megsy . " Yes , " he said , " I 've wondered about that too . Havant has an idea , but of course he 's not going to tell me . I do n't know . One day perhaps I 'll meet D.C. again . If I do I 'll ask him . He 'll have to talk to me . Just as I had to talk to you . " Armitage got up and walked out . Valete : Harold Mortimer Winthrop . Block That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many a sentence that we find in incoming manuscripts these days is a construction like that of this sentence which you are now reading . Accused by some people of devising and popularizing this curious construction is the magazine Time . Insisting that Time is not guilty , however , are many people who say that the habit is too widely spread to have sprung from the rhetorical eccentricities of a single magazine . Facing the students of American journalistic style is therefore the problem of deciding who is responsible and what shall be done to him . Suffering from nausea at the construction meanwhile , and wincing at using it even for purposes of admonition , are the editors of this Magazine. - w - -  George R. Clark
