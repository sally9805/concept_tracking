txt MONETARY ACCORD RATIFIED IN FRANCE Assembly Approves Bretton Woods , American Loan , Franc Devaluation By LANSING WARREN BY Wireless to THE NEW YORK rims . PARIS , Thursday , Dec , 27 ? Establishing a new value for the franc at 119.107 to the dollar , the National Constituent Assembly ratified the Bretton Woods accords early today and approved the French Government 's agreement for a purchase credit with the Export-Import Bank . The ratification measures were voted by a show of hands without opposition , while the recorded ballot on the law revaluing the Bank of France 's gold reserves , which consummated the devaluation , was 506 for and 44 against . President de Gaulle , addressing the Assembly just before the votes , said that approval of the accords and the realignment of the // French currency was required by economic necessities . He drew a pathetic picture of France ill equipped , weakened by the war and lacking the means of production , having gained political freedom and now being obliged to fight for her economic liberty . " To make this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ export . To regain a balanced budget we must renounce new expenditures and not suppress any receipts ; and over and above all we must produce . This is a task in which the entire nation must join . " He said that the task would be the final test of France 's democracy . Vote Devoid of Enthusiasm The measures were voted without enthusiasm but as inevitable consequences of France 's position after many speakers had adjured the Government to press an overall economic plan to enable France to win her economic peace . One deputy expressed the fear that the French colonies , with a different rate of exchange , would later be estranged further by events . Another mentioned the solidarity loan , or capital levy , which all French property owners must pay in January . The franc law includes a provision that Frenchmen having funds or property abroad must declare them at the new valuation of the franc . An effort to make an exception for Basques with property in the United States failed of passage . During the debate , Finance Minister Rene Pleven issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France had come through the war with her gold reserves intact , At the start of the war , he said , the reserves in gold and in divisen represented $3,200,000,000 . Today , he said , they are not more than $1,800,000 , - 000 . The difference resulted , he said , from expenditures for goods abroad before and after liberation and from the restitution of Belgian gold seized by the Germans . Private gold holdings , he declared , might be estimated at $1,000,000 , - 000 , of which part could be liquidated only with difficulty . Cites Export Program He pointed out that France 's import program for 1946 amounted to $2,500,000,000 . " France can not recover by either her gold stocks or holdings abroad , " he said . ' ' She must draw largely on foreign credits , notably in dollars , and without these credits our convalescence will drag on and we run the risk of vegetating in autarchy . " France , impoverished by the war , the Assembly was told , can not hope to undertake her reconstruction without economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To obtain this she must share in the Bretton Woods agreement , which , if imperfect , is the first attempt at organizing international trade co ' operation . If she surrenders part of her sovereignty in monetary matters , she will stand to gain other advantages , it was argued . M. Pleven declared that the new rate for the franc , in the opinion of all the members of the Government , could be defended , and he urged the necessity of hard work and French solidarity for increased production if the operation were to succeed . In this connection he indicated that French luxury products should be reserved exclusively for export to assist France in paying for her imports . Many ' speakers indicated the view that the United States should give assurances of purchases of French products as well as finding a market here for her production . The Bourses were closed to prevent speculation as the Assembly debated the new parity for the franc-119.107 to the dollar  --  the ratification of the Bretton Woods accords and the credit agreement with the Export-Import Bank . The session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ministers of Economy and Production and the rapporteurs of all the chief economic committees . It was prolonged far into the night . Exchange Rates Listed The Government 's order fixing the new franc value was published in the journal Officiel , and laid down prices for buying and selling foreign exchange by the French equalization fund at the following rates : Dollar cash  --  Bought , 118.90 francs ; sold , 119.30 , Dollar banknotes  --  Bought , 117.50 francs ; sold , 119.30 . Pound cash  --  Bought , 479.70 francs ; sold , 480.30 . Pound banknotes  --  Bought , 475.50 francs ; sold , 480.30 . As a consequence of the decrees the gold price was set at 131,900 francs per fine ounce . This revalues the gold reserves in the Bank of France to bring them up 118,000,000,000 to 183,000,000,000 francs . The decree stipulates that this surplus must be utilized for several specific purposes , including the cession of 400 tons of fine gold to the stabilization fund , and the liquidation of a certain number of Treasury bonds providing an exchange guarantee for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The residue , it is provided , will be placed to the credit of the Treasury 's account with the Bank of France , which has fallen to 9,000 , - 000,000 francs . The new valuation puts the gold price at 197 francs for the gold dollar . Army Exchanges Shut One unexpected effect of the measure was the closing of the United States Army 's , postoffices and post exchanges in Paris , a cessation of Army pay and a general blocking of prices for all goods sold to American troops in francs on the dollar rate . This means that the new prices for things purchased from the Army will be higher in proportion to the changed value of the franc . At the same time , the 850-franc " bonus " paid since September to American soldiers by the French Government to compensate for the unfavorable exchange will vanish . Black-market trading in the franc was reported to be unaffected and transactions were understood to have taken place at rates considerably higher than that established today . Presumably , such transactions were to provide Frenchmen who lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or were accepted by those expecting another devaluation . M. Pleven told the Assembly that he had received the endorsement of both the British and the American Governments for the rate chosen . Letters from Secretary of the Treasury Fred Vinson and Hugh Dalton , Chancellor of the Exchequer , were made public . Mr. Vinson 's message was interpreted as encouragement for French hopes for American financial aid in the immense reconstruction program .
