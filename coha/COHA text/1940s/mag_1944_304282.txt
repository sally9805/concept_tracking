Months of jungle misery had made G.I.s in the China-Burma-India Theater a sensitive audience . Mere days of it also had their effect on some already sensitive big-name cinema stars . By last week the resulting strain was enough to rupture the CBI Theater 's U.S.O. circuit , send sparks flying from New Delhi to Hollywood . <P> First sign of trouble came fortnight ago when Roundup , CBI 's official , irrepressible G.I. weekly , complained that all too many soldiers were being disappointed by needlessly broken entertainment schedules . Citing cases , Roundup said that Joel McCrea , " large , husky , over-six-foot male , " called off his announced 60-day tour in Cairo when he heard that " CBI is tough . " Paulette Goddard left the theater six days early when she " reportedly was taken ill . " Pledged to 120 days on the CBI circuit , Joe E. Brown " suddenly remembered a previous engagement in North Africa . . . decamped after 37 . " <P> The final straw was added , said Roundup , when Ann Sheridan came home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever want to go back . Her reason : " It 's too rough . " <P> Prior Commitments , Enceinte Wives . Declaring that soldiers have a right to grumble " when entertainers show up with hammy routines that would get yawns at a free-dish matinee in Springfield , Ohio , and then dog it after a month or six weeks , " Roundup 's editors did so : <P> " These selfless patriots who , incidentally , are well fed , clothed , housed , transported and paid by the Army and the U.S.O. , discover in a couple of weeks that CBI is hot , wet , full of mosquitoes and they suddenly develop prior commitments , serious ailments , enceinte wives . . . spend , in the case of Sheridan . . . &; Co. , a total of 35 days out of a promised minimum 60 , pick up a little money and a lot of publicity and sneak back to the United States to recuperate from the whole horrible ordeal . " <P> Hollywood Howl . When the complaint reached the U.S. last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . Actress Goddard insisted that she had " played all but three days when I was ordered to bed by the Army physician . " Comedian Brown , who has an outstanding record of devotion to soldier entertainment and whose soldier son was killed in a plane crash , angrily retorted that he " did all a 53-year-old man could do . " The Hollywood Victory Committee blamed broken promises on Army snags , added that Ann Sheridan and Joel McCrea had both been , held up by lack of transportation . <P> Taking up for herself , Actress Sheridan went even farther , offered to " fight boy fashion , no holds barred , " with anybody who thought she had dogged it . In a letter to Roundup 's editor , she claimed that her tour was made at considerable personal sacrifice , added : " I 'm wondering if your wife , sweetheart or sister has bucket-seated her way 60,000 miles . . . at better than a thousand miles a day , playing even two bad shows , eating C-or K-rations more often than hot groceries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's littler girl's-room time , go down to the men 's toilet and wait till it 's cleared so that the girl troupers may use it . <P> " And by the way , " she added , " how long has it been since you left that swivel editor 's chair to ride the Hump ?
