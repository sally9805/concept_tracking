Egyptian newsmen wanted answers . What are America 's intentions in the Middle East ? They had watched staffs of British and American planners growing in their land , far beyond military needs ; had seen British and Americans begin juggling for air transport supremacy . But while British intentions were clear , how about the U.S. ? Was the U.S. preparing to remain in the Middle East-politically , economically , militarily-at war 's end ? <P> James M. Landis , new U.S. Economic Director for the Middle East , skittishly skirted these questions last week at his first Cairo press conference . Said he gravely : " U.S. policy is ' achievement of the objectives of the Atlantic Charter . ' " Egyptian newsmen fidgeted . To them , the Four Freedoms already sounded as stale as " Making the World Safe for Democracy " did after Versailles . Egypt was safe , so to them the war was over . Egyptians are fighting the peace . They wanted more specific , realistic answers to the suspicions of Syrians , Iraqians , Persians , Egyptians , Palestinians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slip : <P> " All policies must have long-range objectives , and these go beyond immediate war objectives into a period of peace . " <P> Egyptians thought , they understood : the answer was yes , the U.S. was in the Middle East to stay . And they were ready to give Landis all the rope he needs , either to help them , or to hang himself-and U.S. interests with him .
