Leyte was declared secure . Now the job in the Philippines was to build up Allied forces , especially in the advanced outpost of Mindoro , for the big push on Luzon . The Japs knew it , and reacted in familiar fashion : they sent down a task force of surface ships to blast the soft-shelled beachhead with heavy guns . <P> It was late afternoon when the enemy task force was sighted , steaming in from the South China Sea , by a Navy search Liberator piloted by Lieut . P. F. Stevens of Joplin , Mo . Stevens reported his find : a battleship , a cruiser and six destroyers . Then he made a beeline back to Mindoro , gassed up and had his plane armed with four 500-lb. bombs . While other strikes were being set up , he flew back to the Jap task force 's course , picked out the battleship as his target . A low-level run with his flying boxcar in the face of concentrated ack-ack resulted in two misses , two direct hits . But the 500-pounders were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy force drove on . <P> Unnerved Gunnery . Stevens retired beyond ack-ack range and hung around to plot the Japs ' course for the Mitchell medium bombers and Thunderbolt fighters then taking off from Mindoro . At 7 p.m. the air-sea battle was on . U.S. air attacks spoiled the Japs ' gunnery and left them with no stomach for slow bombardment runs which might have inflicted serious damage on Mindoro installations . Instead , while being chivvied from the air , the Japs steamed up &; down the coast , taking pot shots as they went , doing negligible damage ashore . <P> PT boats darted out from Mindoro to join the battle , but had to be recalled because U.S. planes were attacking them , mistaking them for Japs in the fitful moonlight . The Mitchells sank the lead Jap destroyer , then the next , finally a third . The cruiser had been damaged . By 1:30 a.m. the enemy ships made a 180 turn and ran back , trailing oil , to the South China Sea . <P> Night after night , Jap planes came down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night after night U.S. ack-ack and Black Widow night fighters took a heavy toll . Day after day U.S. bombers roared over enemy-occupied bases on Luzon , destroying 144 planes in three days . It was an aerial war of attrition , before the next push could begin . <P> Last week , a big U.S. convoy ( the Jap said 30 transports and 20 escorting cruisers and destroyers ) ploughed through three days of enemy air attacks in the Mindanao and Sulu Seas . At first the jittery Japs feared it might be headed for Luzon , but the convoy put in at Mindoro . The buildup was proceeding along with the attrition . Soon enough Luzon would be the target for other convoys .
