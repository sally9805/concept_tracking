In Manhattan last week the U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed what many a plain citizen has long suspected : that most popular songs sound pretty much alike . Jack Darrell , author , decade ago , of a not very successful ditty called Does Anybody Want a Kewpie ? , had brought suit for plagiarism against Al Sherman and Abner Silver , whose It Happened on the Beach at Bali Bali was a hit five years ago . Darrell showed that the same eight-note theme recurs in each song . But the Circuit Court dismissed his complaint . Said its three learned judges : although there are plenty of combinations of notes , there are only a few which meet " the infantile demands of the popular ear . . . . Recurrence is not , therefore , an inevitable badge of plagiarism. "
