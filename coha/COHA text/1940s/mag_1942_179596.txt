( See Cover ) <P> Semion Timoshenko , the peasant from Bessarabia , had seldom seen a better stand of wheat . It was high and golden , ripening in the sun , nodding with the blue cornflowers in the summer winds which swept the valley of the Don . The grain , his peasant eyes told him , was almost ready for harvest when the Germans came . <P> The tanks rolled through the grain . Their treads crushed the food of Russia into the Russian earth . Or , where the Russian scorchers were quick and thorough-and they were usually both-fire curled through the grain . The print of the tanks was harsh and clear in the stubble , and the smell of the burning was bitter in the nostrils of the retreating armies . Many Russians fell in the fields , and the hot , black ash which should soon have been bread pressed into their mouths , their wounds , their souls . <P> The peasant from Bessarabia did not forget . <P> Face of the Earth . Semion Timoshenko was a peasant before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the defender of the Don . The chances are that his parents could read nothing but the skies and fields , the winds and weathers of Bessarabia when he was born , 47 years ago , in the village of Furmanka . He was 20 , long out of the village school and hardened to the farm , when the last Tsar 's armies drafted him in 1915 . He was a hardening young trooper in the cavalry when he went over with his regiment to the Red Revolution in 1917 . <P> Now only four other soldiers-and Stalin-rank with him or above him in the Red Army scale . Between the cap of an officer and the starred , medaled tunic of a Marshal , his face is still a peasant 's face . It is heavy , broad and brooding , cruel and kind , the face of Soviet Russia and the Red Army . In his face , in the whole person and history of Timoshenko , are the qualities by which Soviet Russia must now live or die . <P> Hate is the Banner . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all Russia that Stalin , the man with the superlative Russian face , spoke last May Day : " They Red soldiers , sailors and airmen have learned to hate the German fascist invaders . They know it is impossible to conquer the enemy without learning to hate him with all their souls ' fibers . " <P> It was of that face and soul , common to soldier and worker alike , that a Moscow trade-union secretary , Mme. Nikolaeva , spoke when she cried to women in the mills : " All work in the rear is being done under the banner of hatred . " <P> It is a defensive hatred , and the Red Army is a defensive army , which has never yet been outstandingly successful on the offensive and is now learning whether defense can be enough . It is to that hatred that Moscow 's communiqus appeal , forever stressing the killing of Germans , the destruction of German tanks , guns , planes . These communiqus sometimes seem to be deliberately deceptive , recounting the deaths of a few hundred Germans in battalion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Russians it is not deception ; it is the feeding of the Russian conviction which a Moscow writer expressed to Correspondent-Author Maurice Hindus : " The loss of territory is never much in Russian wars , so long as our armies make it a graveyard for German soldiers .
