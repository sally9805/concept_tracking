When France fell last spring , in what to many observers seemed a spiritual as well as a physical collapse , one of the first American reactions was to look anxiously to our American resources of resolution and courage , lest they too be found wanting . This impulse was as inevitable as that of a man who slaps his pockets when informed that his neighbor 's wallet has been stolen . Many Americans promptly found their countrymen , and especially their younger countrymen , lacking in a fighting conviction of the rightness of democracy , justice , and freedom . Archibald MacLeish attributed this to the authors who had been so intent upon showing up the abominations of war that they had disillusioned their juniors . Among many manuscripts submitted to Harper 's on the temper of America we selected for publication one by Roy Helton , who attributed its shortcomings to an over feminized culture , and another by Mortimer 5 . Adler , who was especially concerned over what he regarded as the indifference and apathy of the college generation , attributing it to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy . Since then our mail at Harper 's has been heavy with replies and counter-attacks . They have been so wide-ranging that , instead of selecting a single article for publication , the Editors have decided to present two short ones and quote from a number of others . In no other way can we give any adequate idea of the diversity of the defense without devoting a whole issue of Harper 's to the debate . First we present a representative of the younger generation itself , Irwin Ross , graduated from Harvard last June : rutERE is a widespread notion that I American young people are cowardly , cynical , and indifferent to the fate of their country . Let us look at the facts . It is generally agreed that the first peace-time conscription bill in the history of this country was enacted because the American people suddenly recognized their danger and understood the need for resolute action . No shortsighted isolationism , little specious immunity here . Naturally , if American youth were wan-dering in the pacifist fairyland one would expect them to bridle at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Gallup 's American Institute of Public Opinion conducted a nation-wide survey of youth 's opinion of conscription . He asked : " Do you think that every able-bodied young man should be made to serve in the Army , Navy , or air force for one year ? " Young people 15 to 20 years of age answered " Yes " to the tune of 67 per cent , while those between the ages of 21 and 29 favored conscription to the tune of 62 per cent . The older people were polled on the same question . Interestingly enough , they favored conscription in the same proportion as the 15- to 20-year group-67 per cent . When passage of the conscription bill became imminent the youth of the land were interviewed once again . This time the question was : " If the draft law is passed , will you , personally , have any objection to spending a year in some branch of the military service ? " Of the men 21 to 24 years old , 68 per cent had no objection . Those between the ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 81 per cent were quite willing to serve , only 19 per cent demurred . Two years ago the American Youth Commission published a survey of 13,528 Maryland young people between the ages of 16 and 24 . This sampling was so selected as to be an accurate cross-section of the 21,000,000 American youth in the same age group : the same percentages of farm and city , negro and white , rich and poor youth , were interviewed . The poll covered a variety of subjects ? family background , employment , education , church attendance , attitudes on contemporary problems ? and is without doubt the most complete inventory of facts about American youth that we possess . The Maryland youngsters were asked what action they would take in case of war . Of the boys , 76 per cent replied that they would volunteer or fight if drafted . Another 12 per cent would answer the call only if invasion threatened . Eleven per cent would refuse under any circumstances . The remainder could not make up their minds . If we remember that this poll was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academic to many people , we must agree that anti-war propaganda had had scant success in promoting conscientious objection . If the great majority of young people are not indifferent to defense and express a willingness to fight when called upon , why all the alarm ? Is it because they apparently do not favor entrance into the European war ? ( " Apparently " is used advisedly , since nobody has taken a poll on the subject . ) Even granting a 90 per cent objection to a war declaration , such a feeling is strongly seconded by the older generation . According to Dr. Gallup as of mid-October , only 17 per cent of the American people favor entry into the war ; the other 83 per cent are resolutely opposed . In common fairness , youth can not be whipped and the oldsters left beyond the range of the birch rod . Perhaps the objection is not to youth 's disinclination to fight in Europe , but only to a suspected disapproval of aiding England . The American people , there seems no doubt , are in favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only young people who circulate petitions with any frequency seem to be college students . One day fifteen hundred Yale undergraduates denounce aid to England , the next day another fifteen hundred petition for such aid . Curiously enough , a few individuals sign both petitions . Or perhaps the oldsters are distressed by the fact that while American youth is still willing to do its duty , the old bravado and full-throated enthusiasm have departed . Few youngsters , apparently , really want to fight for fighting 's sake ; the old itch is gone . When Dr. Gallup asked the young men if they favored conscription the affirmative responses were without exception nonbelligerent and merely stressed the need for preparedness : " So if we had a war they would n't be greenhorns . " " We would not be caught the way others were if we are trained . " " So as to preserve the United States as a democracy and a dominant world power . " What causes surprise is not that 81 per cent are willing to serve in the armed forces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscription . The 19 per cent are very vocal too . But for this very reason , the rumpus they make can easily promote an exaggerated estimate of their numerical strength . For young isolationists , particularly of the left-wing variety , have mastered the technics of modern propaganda . They make good copy and the girls are quite photogenic . The American Youth Congress , in search of an anti-conscription gag , selects an auburn-haired beauty from Rockford College , puts her on a white horse , dubs her Miss Pauline Revere , and parades her through the streets of downtown Chicago . Newspapers all over the country display the young lady . Harvard students don gas-masks and picket the classroom of a rather belligerent history instructor . A Committee for the Recognition of Classroom Generals accuses five prominent professors of war-mongering and sends them tin soldiers ; when a professor calls the students " yellow pups " the students rebut heatedly and the alumni back in Oshkosh cancel their checks for the new library . At Cornell undergraduates trundle a wooden tank around the campus , gathering signatures for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up recruiting booths all over the college , to enlist students in a " crusade for diplomas , not bayonets . " Undergraduates at Ohio State are believers in direct action . They sponsor a well-publicized person-to-person call to President Roosevelt demanding that he keep us out of war . The newspapers are very co-operative since these pranks provide endless opportunities to tag the students as reds . A similarly distorted picture is often given of innocuous youth conferences . The Communist delegates to these gatherings always view them as battles of more than verbal decisiveness . Organized in a " faction , " the Communists confer before each session and plan strategy , coaching speakers and stationing them in different parts of the hall , so that when they arise to speak the urge will appear spontaneous and the resultant near-unanimity of opinion will be all the more impressive . Non-Communists , who are untutored in these tactics , too often retreat into a bewildered silence . Frequently if they overcome their diffidence and do rise to speak , a Communist partisan in the chair will embroil them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy of the Communists give an unwarranted prominence to whatever view they momentarily espouse . This would be equally true if the party suddenly shifted to interven- tion , a likely eventuality when and if Russia enters the war against Germany . Then the news from the campus would be of students beating the war drums . The truth would probably be that the fellow-travelers were beating the war drums in the name of the American students . But while the radicals indubitably monopolize the headlines , it is also true that a large segment of intelligent youth opinion is isolationist : pro-Ally , but hesitating to lift a hand to help lest such generosity draw us into war . From this undeniable fact too many of our older generation of democratic stalwarts jump to the conclusion that at least these youths are non-believers in democracy and the American heritage , indifferent to moral values , cynics before their time , a callow and heartless lot . The truth , by contrast , is that the leaders of isolationist youth opinion are almost without exception idealists and fervent believers in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicholas Murray Butler demonstrate their faith in a precious , if passing , folk custom of the American people . At the University of Michigan the luxury of free speech has already cost fourteen students their education . Three years ago hundreds of American boys volunteered for service in Loyalist Spain . Young people all over the country felt the call and battled with their consciences ; the proportion who finally packed their bags is large in view of our distance from the conflict and the extent to which the issue was befogged . Equally misunderstood are the progressive and quite commendable mainsprings of much of this isolationism . It is not an isolationism of inertia , retreat , or plain lack of perception . Shortsighted it may be , yet it is worthy of respectful consideration . True-blue pacifism of course commends itself to only a small group of young people ; but none of these even can be accused of a lack of idealism . They are courageous to a fault , as witness the eight Union Theological students and two socialists in New York who braved five-year jail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious groups preach nonviolence as a way of life and are quite zealous in keeping their ranks free of individuals whose convictions are less hardy . When the Fellowship of Reconciliation sponsored an anti-conscription march in New York City on registration day no one was allowed to participate who was not experienced in the tactics of nonviolent action and would not be certain to " turn the other cheek " to provocation . The majority of isolationists do not have these scruples about fighting . They merely object to participation in a war whose outward aspects do not present to them an unblurred picture of black and white . Mistrust of England is an understandable , if unjustifiable , hangover from pre-Churchill appeasement days . Subsequent events have shaken the faith of many in the democratic pretensions of the Allied cause . Similarly with the defense effort of the United States . These young men and women believe they see business obtaining countless concessions as the price of its grudging co-operation , while labor is constantly stepped on . While democratic oratory reaches new heights of eloquence , they see drastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minority parties are ruled off the ballot , religious sects are persecuted , alertness to the fifth column verges on anti-alien hysteria . Looking beyond our frontiers , they see us talking of a good neighbor policy andthen putting the screws on Mexico ; planning to win the Western Hemisphere for democracy and simultaneously supporting what look to them like native fascist regimes in South America . Our actions belie our words , they argue : is this a war for democracy ? Finally many young people are dubious about defending a society which in peacetime has no need for them . If they are asked to fight they want to enjoy the privileges as well as the liabilities of American citizenship . That means jobs , educational opportunities , as well as the other recognized amenities of our civilization . The American Youth Commission reports that there are 4,000,000 unemployed young men and women between the ages of 15 and 24 . Of these , only about 750,000 have emergency work provided by the National Youth Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps . The Maryland survey previously mentioned found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One has only to attend a meeting of a group such as the American Youth Congress in order to experience the reality of these soulless figures . There are many things that can be said about the Youth Congress , but one fact which can not be gainsaid is that this obstreperous group manages to bring together a sectionally and economically representative body of young people , which is intelligent and articulate to boot . Whatever the political predispositions of its leaders ( I distrust them as much as anyone ) the fact remains that when the American Youth Congress attracts 4,000 youngsters to a Youth Citizenship Institute in Washington , as it did last February , there are enough genuine Americans to counterbalance the sealed-and-delivered consignment of youthful Communists . I attended the Youth Institute , held in the ornate gold-plated Interdepartmental Auditorium , and I watched a long stream of boys ? packing-house workers from Chicago , shipping clerks from New York 's garment district , Negro sharecroppers from Missouri , farm hands from Idaho ? file up to the platform , murmur their hopes and frustrations into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great auditorium . The common denominator of their testimonies was that they were unable to make a living , that they wanted to work , that the chance to work was denied them . The Welfare Council of New York recently published the results of a survey of one million New York City young people between the ages of 16 and 24 . ( McGill and Matthews , The Youth of New York City , The Macmillan Co . ) The same cross-section sampling was employed as in the Maryland study by the American Youth Commission . The interviewers asked if the depression interfered with marriage plans ; 32 per cent of the young men , 21 per cent of the young women , over 21 , replied that it did . " Things were too bad and my girl refused to wait any longer , " one chap said . Another was blunter : " We broke off ? no money . " An economic silver cord was revealed by a third : " My money was needed at home , so I gave my girl up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I ca n't get a guy -- I do n't have the clothes to go out in . " Another recurrent note : " Since moving to a poor neighborhood I wo n't invite people . " If one bears these facts in mind , does there not seem something insensitive in the plea that the young people get tough , tighten their belt-lines , put aside the luxuries of an effete society ? Roy Helton wrote in the September issue of Harper 's : " We indulge our children illimitably . Instead of rearing a race of lusty , weather-conditioned sons and daughters of democracy , we exhaust our private purses to buy gasoline for our racing youth , and strain the resources of our schools and colleges to erect stadia unparalleled since the days of degenerating Rome . " One wonders how many of our four million unemployed youth enjoy the luxury ofa private car or can afford $3.85 to witness a big-time football snatch . The sacrifice of these inessentials would be little to ask if the gain were the strengthening of democracy . But when words like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discipline " arc so vaguely bandied about , the unsophisticated can only conclude that not alone our upper-and middle-class youth are being discussed , but our entire younger generation ? a spoiled and pampered lot , who should forthwith be denied the extravagances of NYA and CCC . Talk such as this will gain few recruits for democracy and runs the risk of alienating many still loyal . According to Dr. Mortimer J. Adler , youth has no faith in the moral verities , since these are not susceptible of scientific proof . As a consequence , young people will believe in democracy only if it works ? if it provides material benefits ? not because it is morally correct . Dr. Adler offers scant evidence to support this thesis . But granting its validity for argument 's sake , the solution he proposes revamping our all-pervasive educational philosophy , chucking out decadent " scientism , " and enthroning moral intuition  - -  seems unrealistic in the extreme . There is insufficient time to save democracy merely by persuading people of its moral soundness . If Americans are essentially pragmatic , as Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground : make democracy work . ' There is one trustworthy specific : give youth a stake in the country ? jobs , hope in the future . Youth does n't ask much . Dr. Gallup recently polled young people on their chief ambition in life ; few were extravagant . Only about 11 per cent of the boys and girls agreed with the 20-yearold Kentucky youth who wanted to " accumulate wealth " or with the 23-year-old clerical secretary in New York whose greatest desire was to be " a lady of leisure . " Over two-thirds merely wanted to improve themselves in a modest fashion . One 23-year-old girl who was a cashier in Nebraska wanted to be a stenographer ; another wanted to be a nurse ; a third , a typist in a Minnesota department store , said she " hoped to live a happy life , " but gave no specifications . The males were similarly undemanding . Typical responses were : a parking-lot attendant in California : " I 'd like to be in the Marine Air Corps " ; an unemployed Virginian , eighteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Pennsylvania youth of 24 , now working in the lithography business : " To be comfortable , secure and to do some good in the world . " The National Youth Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps have made a start in the right direction . The CCC semiannually takes 250,000 young men off the streets of the nation , feeds and clothes them , builds up their bodies , develops their manual abilities . The out-of-school work program of the NYA has been expanded , by virtue of a recent appropriation of $32,500,000 , and now accommodates 500,000 young people , who work on projects that provide an elementary kind of vocationaltraining . They do not learn a specific trade , but they get enough experience at different tasks so that they are not green when they secure a job in private industry . NYA and CCC , however , care for only 750,000 of the 4,000,000 unemployed youth . Much , much more is needed . Last spring President Roosevelt proposed a youth-training program which would have enrolled 2,000,000 boys in the service of the nation . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compulsion was unnecessary . Let jobs be offered and the youth will flock to them . But the President 's plan had the merit of recognizing that a large-scale effort was demanded . It may be true that the youth problem can not be solved apart from our general unemployment problem . If that is so , and alienation of youth 's loyalties is feared , there is all the more reason to doctor our ailing economy . One way or another , jobs must be provided for the vast multitude of unemployed youth . It is the only solution . Next we present Dr. Margaret Mead , anthropologist and author of Coming of Age in Samoa , who from the vantage point of more maturity addresses the middle and older generations : WHEN I left the United States in 1931 people were talking about adolescence , a malady that afflicted all our boys and girls , our young men and women , our undergraduates . When I returned in 1933 people were talking about Youth , and it was spelled with a capital letter . The younger generation were no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to maturity and temporarily afflicted with inconvenient growing pains , which all of theirelders had been through and all their juniors would have to go through . The younger generation had been frozen into a named minority group , with the dubious right which all minorities win of being spelled with a capital letter . Adolescence was a state through which individuals passed ; Youth was a group of individuals , who might be indicted and discussed , accused , challenged , defended , bullied , protected , as a minority . Like most vocal minorities , Youth was promptly discovered by friends , advocates , warm-hearted and quick-brained members of our society who realized what a mere quarter of a loaf ? how often no loaf at all ? was being allowed to those who grew up in the nineteen-thirties . At conferences and congresses the plight of Youth was discussed as if it were somehow special and different from the plight of human beings ( except of course for Old Age , which Dr. Townsend had likewise endowed with capitals ) . I remember remarking , at a Progressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term Youth as it was being used by Youth 's friends invariably carried connotations of unhappiness , deprivation , frustration . To-day , on every side , we are seeing the second phase , the inevitable development of this movement , this friendly attempt to consider Youth as a minority with potential pressure-group rights . For minorities and emergencies seem to possess a natural negative attraction for each other . Just to the extent that people are frightened , uncertain , panicky will they attempt to explain and solve the difficulties which beset them by blaming someone . In these days of mass movements it is no longer possible to blame an individual ; it is necessary to find a whole group who may be represented as large enough and strong enough , either to have betrayed us ? if a past defeat depresses our spirit ? or to be on the point of betraying us ? if it is the prospect of future defeat that makes us toss in our beds . Furthermore , democracy can not logically make use now of a large number of historically available scapegoats ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a decent pretense of not doing what they do . They persecute the Jews , the dissenters , the intellectuals , Masons , Catholics , etc. ; so we can not . And yet a great many of us have as much panicstricken despair and humiliation to work off over the present state of America as the Germans had over the treaty of Versailles . And so , sure that Democracy is doomed , we , prophets of disaster , are already searching for those who will have betrayed us , taking their photographs and writing their biographies , like the enterprising editors of newspaper " morgues . " We realize that in America democratic feeling has been weary and jaded . Democracy has come to mean to too many people either the mask worn by the exploiter or else a set of negations for which no one would bother either to live or to die . We realize that we need a national moral inventory . But there are two ways to take such an inventory . Either we can seek to find out what has been lacking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A great many current speakers and writers are taking the latter course ? and Youth is becoming the national scapegoat for our moralizers . In the October Harper 's , for instance , Mr. Adler said of the present college generation : " They seem to have grown up without any allegiances that could be betrayed , without a moral philosophy to renounce " ; and he commented upon the barrage of commencement orations last Tune which lamented " the prevalent materialism , the single-minded self-interest of the college graduate 's aim ? to take care of himself and let the rest go hang ! " In the Atlantic Monthly for August , in an article addressed to Youth , Arnold Whitridge said , " Your distrust of ideals frightens me . ... You are disgusted more than our generation realizes by any sort of moral appeal . " Note that the accusation is pat . It is our moral stamina , our willingness as a nation to stand up to the task of making Democracy mean something , which we seriously doubt . And so we accuse Youth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have engaged in these tirades are no doubt experts on the crass stupidities and vulgar pseudo-science of the Nazi racial theories ; they can provide chapter and verse from history , sociology , and anthropology to show what nonsense the Nazis have talked . It does not , how-. ever , seem to occur to them that they may be talking just as arrant nonsense . For what is " a moral sense " ? A moral sense is a primary emotional conviction that it matters whether a line of conduct is right or wrong . A moral sense is not identical with good conduct , it is merely identical with the recognition that the issue between right and wrong is infinitely important . Now a moral sense is not an inalienable aspect of humanity ? as some scientists assume ? nor a special attribute of certain " chosen " individuals ? as some theologians assume . The majority of the peoples of the earth do not have what we call a moral sense at all . They may be generous , industrious , responsible , self-sacrificing , truthful ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the issue of right versus wrong is a primary one . For a moral sense ? as we use the word , and as it is necessarily used by all who write within our linguistic and cultural tradition is based upon a certain system of child-rearing , in which the parent stands to the child as the ideal of conduct . When this parent says to the child , " If you do as I do will love you and approve of you and reward you . If you do not do as I do I will not love you , I will punish and deprive you , " a mechanism is set up in the child which lasts throughout the child 's life . To do wrong means to have the love and approval of the parent withdrawn . The mere thought of doing wrong brings back to the child 's mind the terrible dread and misery of the times when he did wrong and mother turned away her face , when father lifted his heavy hand or lashed out with his potent tongue . Doing right , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of security and content which a tired boy experienced after a long day of being good , when his head rested against his mother 's shoulder or when his tall father held out a hand into which he could slip his own . As the child grows up he will learn that father and mother were not perfect , not the moral giants which our society decrees they must appear to be ; but by that time it does not mailer , for he has new within him a view of the world , which we call conscience . All his life when he fails to live up to the impossibly high standards which he was set he will feel guilty ; he will experience in phantasy the punishments of childhood . And as the standard is impossibly high there are always enough individuals in our society pushing on toward some lofty goal to give us that very special culture-trait called " progress . " Bringing children up thus to have a moral sense is a special invention , characteristic of European-American culture and very seldom found in other parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have we a record of any primitive people who have brought their children up in this way . The American Indian child was reared to be afraid of what people would say . The Balinese child is reared to be indiscriminately afraid of doing anything different from those of his own sex , caste , age , and village . He never asks the question , " Is this right ? " He asks , " Do I dare or do n't I ? " and if the act being considered is new or strange , he invariably concludes , " I do n't . " On the Sepik River in New Guinea , Iatmul children are concerned with one simple problem : " If I do this , will somebody hit me ? " Their secondary problem is : " If I can get away now without being hit , will they still be angry enough to hit me to-night when mosquitoes and hunger drive me reluctantly home ? " As the present maligned younger generation were brought up in our society by parents who were members of our society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest that they have none is as unscientific and nonsensical as to suggest that they do n't speak the American language . A moral sense is not something that one loses or acquires as an adult , like a Southern accent or a taste for pie a la mode . It is the inevitable concomitant of the American family and the American way of life . Because we have a moral sense we are becoming profoundly disturbed and miserable , as the present emergency forces us to take stock of ourselves . It remains to be seen whether we have the moral guts to shoulder the blame or whether we are too weak to stand it , and so must project it upon the next generation . The present generation of children in totalitarian countries are not being reared with this kind of moral personality ; under the new totalitarian state , another kind of personality is being substituted for it , of a sort which is technically called paranoid ? each individual achieving perfection in his own eyes by projecting all evil on others ? a sort of personality which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our Democracy lies , not in those who are just growing up , but in all of us and because we have a moral sense . Are we going to find this moral overhauling of our national and civic and personal lives so unbearable that we too have to take refuge in paranoia , in a phantasy of perfection , in which invasion becomes " counter-attack with pursuit " and arrest becomes " protective custody " ? In the councils of the middle-aged and elderly , as they fume and fret over Youth , part of this basic issue is being decided . " These young people are n't the only ones who have had to face troubles and sacrifices , " they mutter , and refer to the unemployment of the nineties . But these younger people of to-day are the only ones ; they are the only generation in our history who have been exposed to just this special combination of parents who dreamed a material dream and children who grew up to find that the material dream had melted away , leaving them not even those things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents ? the right to work , the right to marry , and the right to have children . They are the only ones who have first been taught it was moral to work hard for success , and then have been given nothing to do . Moral as they were and are , they are placed in a position in which they can not do what they have been taught is right . And they have been carefully brought up to feel miserable and guilty unless they do do right . We , the American Democracy of the thirties , placed our young people in a moral dilemma which is without precedent in our history . And we can not escape from our responsibility by calling them names . But , tragically enough , we can seem to escape from it by making a scapegoat out of Youth . We can keep a temporary self-respect for ourselves ? and lose Democracy . It will be very simple to Lose Democracy this way . We have only to go on telling our young people that they are Selfish Youth , Cynical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as prodigal sons . Now prodigal sons , historically , sow their wild oats and go home . But what do you do if you are prodigal sons through no fault of your own , because your father kept nothing but wild oats in his barn ? What do you do if you have never left home , and fathers and elder brothers begin calling you names ? You do n't like being called a prodigal son . You 'd like to prove that you have a moral sense , that you are capable of idealism , sensible idealism which is n't excuse for laziness or exploitation or indifference or greed ! So there is nothing left to do but leave your father 's house and find a new house where there will be much rejoicing over the new arrival ? the camp of the totalitarians . People under thirty in this country have a moral sense just as people over thirty do , just as both age groups speak the same language , wear clothes , and know how to answer the telephone and read a newspaper . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel guilty , but not strong enough to make us criticize ourselves , we may drive the next generation , who also have a moral sense and also want to be right ? at least part of the time into the fold of totali-tarian leaders . The totalitarian leaders will not make the mistake of blaming and blackening those who by an accident of age are going to have to take it on the chin . They will praise them , encourage them , and give them work to do . To save our democratic system will require a lot of idealism ; nobody doubts that . And it will require the idealism of those who happen to be young even more than the idealism of those who happen to be old . But idealism is a plus value . True , it presupposes a moral sense ; so all American young people have the capacity for it . But to act idealistically you must first be allowed to act . No matter how nobly soldiers may have fought and frozen in a battle in the snow , when they come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbed hands and feet before they start out on their next march . If some young people 's verbalizations about ideals and Democracy seem a little stiff and unpracticed , remember they have been out in the cold ? doing nothing , not fighting for ideals , because they had no chance to . Give them a chance to warm up a little , give them a chance to participate in the exciting task of making Democracy matter , and their capacity for idealism will be found quite intact . After all , none of it has ever been put to the test . We supplement the articles by Irwin Ross and Margaret Mead by summarizing , with a few quotations , the arguments presented in bushels of manuscripts and letters defending the young people and replying to Messrs . Helton and Adler . A number of our correspondents , including both older and younger writers , join Mr. Ross in denying that American young people as a group are soft , selfish , easygoing . Marian Castle , for instance , insists that one could just as readily collect evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleges in her own Stale , Colorado , and writes : . . . As I did so , it seemed to me a pity that so much . publicity had been given the young exhibitionists who attend youth congresses , when the real leaders of to-morrow are too busy putting them selves through college to attend to anything but their own business . Apparently , these latter have never heard that The Frontiers Are All Gone or that The Government Helps Those Who Wo n't Help Themselves . The placement director of one of the State colleges repeated my question in surprise : " Are they willing to work ? They beg for it . Any kind of work at all . If you eat in one of our downtown restaurants just watch for the ' best ' sorority pins on the girl waitresses .

" " No , " he said sadly , " each year a lot of conscientious , well-qualified young people , especially from the farms , write in to ask us haw they can come to college , earn all their own way , and help their parents too . We have to tell them it ca n't be done . " I sat silent . " And help their parents too . " I thought of a certain well-paid public servant in my State who let his mother collect an old-age pension .

The other boy , above average scholastically , worked at a night club as a bus boy ; during the fall he sold Christmas cards ; in the winter he took care of a furnace ; and all year round he delivered rental library books . " She paused apologetically . " I ca n't seem to recall his other jobs . " I heard the same story at all the other colleges and universities in the State ? of young people eager to work and unafraid to work and persistent in hunting work . And they are student leaders too , not the obscure , forgotten members of the student populations . At one university every president of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least a part of his way . My State is only a sample of the nation 's youth . Who can call them soft when , according to the Department of the Interior , in a study of 50,000 recent graduates from 31 colleges in 20 States , it was found that two-thirds of the men and almost half the women had earned part of their way ; and that of this 50,000 , only one and one-half per cent had ever been on relief ? I made a trip clear across my State to a little sagebrush college . It is no Berea , no Antioch , no experimental school ; it is simply a small ( the student body numbers 450 ) State teachers ' college , a typical example of decentralized education . About two-thirds of the entire student body earn part of their way . No graduate in the past five years has been on relief . Extensive loan funds are administered without losses . And above all , here it is fashionable to work . The official who guided me round said regretfully : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in so small a college and so small a town . NYA aid , as you know , is limited to somewhere around a tenth of the enrollment ; and nearly seven-tenths of our young folks must work . Last year our student president worked nights in a garage , greasing and washing cars ; sometimes he 'd be a little sleepy in his first class . But he 's coming back this year for his Master 's . His chum is janitor in the Community Church . Of course you can overdo this matter of self-support . " " Overdo it ? " " We noticed that one girl seemed listless . We finally discovered that she had n't been able to get enough work , so she 'd been living on stale bread from the bakery . Said she could eat on ten cents a week . It 's not a good diet for a nineteen-year-old , " he said soberly . No , I thought , nor is it a diet for softies . Again and again in our correspondence the older generation are blamed for whatever shortcomings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and not by younger writers alone ) , set the pattern of selfishness , cynicism , evasion of public duty ? The young people , we are told , are now asked to be cheerfully ready to offer to the nation all they have : their lives . Their elders have not been asked in recent years to offer their lives , but they have been confronted with emergencies in which the American people needed their money and their loyalty to the common good . How eager have they shown themselves to make sacrifices ? Have they paid their taxes without complaint ? Have they shown none of the " gim me " spirit ? What generation held out for the Bonus , for the Townsend Plan , for Ham ' n ' Eggs ? By way of a variant on this attack on the elders , a number of our younger correspondents say in effect , " It is you elders of ours who have taught us to be skeptical , to be tolerant , to be wary of believing propagandists . Now you find some of us too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As one young man puts it : We youth have had hammered into us for the past fifteen years that War Does Not Solve the Questions It Is Fought to Solve . We have been introduced to the machinations of war-minded diplomats and war profiteers and propaganda machines . We have heard ministers proclaim that they would never again be induced to turn militarist as in 1917 . We have been told that history repeats itself . Do you wonder that , having learned these lessons well , some of us become cynical now ? Another writes , with bitter irony : The real fraud upon my generation , however , lay ? deeper than the teachings about war itself ? in the liberalism instilled in us . Sociological thinking must now keep pace with the advances of physical science , we were told . Commencement speakers admitted that our elders had botched the job ( sometimes we remember that ) ; but we were to be the light of a new civilization . The schools had kept us clean of the narrow ideas and ugly prejudices of earlier genera ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work decent hours for decent wages . We would believe in adequate relief for the poor , friendly care for the old and decrepit , modern hospitalization for the sick and insane , and good housing for everyone . And because we would be unselfish , these benefits would be given regardless of race , nationality , or creed . The Jew , the Negro , the alien " Wop , " and the " heathen Chinee " would not be cut out from sharing like brothers . That was the youthful idealism of my generation . But , ah , what a dangerous line of thinking it proves to be if you follow it conscientiously . For you are just as apt as not to get the subversive idea that you should be brotherly towards a Nazi German . Unlike many of my fellows , I had the additional misfortune of a solid Christian upbringing . This gave my ideas of brotherliness a root in Christian ethics , and makes it that much harder to discard them now . I learned the memory verses : " Love thy neighbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do good to them that hate you , and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you . " Somehow I got the foolish notion that these were practical rules for living and should be applied . As if anyone meant you should go to the cross or a concentration camp for " loving thy enemy , " be he a laboring man , Jew , alien , or some kid in a foreign uniform ! As if to point Dr. Mead 's argument , a young New Turku who objects fiercely to war and everything military declares that he does so not because he lacks ideals , but because he lives by them and from the tone of his letter there is no denying his deep sincerity . More representative , however , than the arguments of these objectors to war , who after all speak for a small minority , is that of William Lytton Payne , who takes issue with Mr. Helton 's contention that America has unduly softened and spoiled its young people . ( A great many readers , including incidentally Airs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over feminized ; but we are here discussing simply his comments on the young people of to-day . ) Surely , says Mr. Payne , Mr. Helton knows that these young people are taller , heavier , and healthier than their grandfathers were ; that they do not sit all the time in stadia but engage in more active sport than their grandfathers did . Surely he would agree that they have been taught by better-trained teachers , in better-equipped schools , and by more intelligent teaching methods which make children actually enjoy going back to school in September . And if most of our young people have enjoyed a more comfortable childhood than their grandparents , since when have we suddenly come to the conclusion that those comforts which we have always regarded as marks of an advanced civilization are debilitating ? On the contrary , says Mr. Payne , the trouble has been that the comforts have not been widely enough distributed . And he concludes : Hitler " put strength into his nation " ? yes , the strength which springs from despair . Who will arise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through despair ? The fate of France , says Mr. Helton , was that of a country which behind a barrier of arms enjoyed a delicious respite . Not so , Mr. Helton : France was rotten to the core with disaffection nurtured on years of unemployment and hopelessness for its people , its youth , its soldiers , and its statesmen . Just there , Mr. Helton , we too are sick , and growing more so at a frightful pace . If we are to survive to the year 2000 we must be tough , writes Mr. Helton . Behind those words is a world of thought . Does he mean a people who can go hungry , jobless , and hopeless that they may have the guns to protect their right to go on being hungry , jobless , and hopeless ? France thought that , and in the foreboding Iull of the Iong winter months her soldiers , her youth , weighed that concept and in the spring found it not worth the candle . If it is a sign of softness to want gadgets , cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for God 's sake let us be soft ! For then we 'll he tough enough for all comers ! We 'll have something to be tough for !
