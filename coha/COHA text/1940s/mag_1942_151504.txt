Pearl Harbor came too late for Colonel Demas T. ( " Nick " ) Craw of the U.S. Army Air Forces . Congenitally unable to wait for war , he took his fighting when &; where he found it as a ( " neutral " ) military observer in the Middle East and Europe . <P> Once he climbed into the bombardier 's seat of a big R.A.F. plane . Over Nazi supply trains at Sofia , Bulgaria he let a stick of bombs go . Nick 's dark eyebrows still twitched with excitement when he got back to Greece . " The train went up with a tremendous smash , " he said . <P> When the Germans took an R.A.F. airdrome in Greece , they caught Nick with his pistol emptied . " You ca n't do this to me-I 'm an American officer ! " he yelled when the Nazis herded him with the captured British . They let him go . <P> When the Axis entered Athens some U.S. officials stayed behind . One day Nick 's car brushed the fender of another carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his car , slapped Craw . Again Nick did not wait for a declaration of war ; the beautiful Italian uniform flopped in the dusty street . A German officer pulled Nick off the two privates . <P> At Casablanca last fortnight , Nick Craw volunteered to go ashore , try to persuade the French commander to surrender . After one fruitless trip , Nick tried again . Machine-gun bullets sang overhead . It was the excitement Nick liked . Then the bullets thudded into his body . <P> A brief A.P . dispatch from North Africa recorded the perfect epitaph for Nick Craw : " He was born for war . "
