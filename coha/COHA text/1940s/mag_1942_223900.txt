In the ornate Paz family crypt in Buenos Aires ' comfortable La Recoleta cemetery , honors came thick last week to the late Jos Clemente Paz , founder of Argentina 's La Prensa . The Argentine Government issued a special commemorative postage stamp . Nationwide collections were taken to erect a monument . U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull sent a laudatory cable , as did many another foreign notable . It was the 100th anniversary of the birth of Argentina 's most famous journalist . <P> Although Don Jos has been dead for 30 years , the newspaper he founded 73 years ago has not changed much . La Prensa is THE Argentine newspaper , is one of the world 's ten greatest papers . <P> Polish , Curiosity , Comics . A cross between the London Times and James Gordon Bennett 's old New York Herald , La Prensa is unlike any other newspaper anywhere . In its fine old building the rooms are lofty and spiced with the odor of wax polish , long accumulated . Liveried flunkies pass memoranda and letters from floor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-speed hydraulic tubes whip copy one mile from the editorial room to one of the world 's most modern printing plants-more than adequate to turn out La Prensa 's 280,000 daily , 430,000 Sunday copies . <P> Argentines are minutely curious about the world . Although newsprint ( from the U.S. ) is scarce , La Prensa usually carries 32 columns of foreign news-more than any other paper in the world . Four years ago most was European-today New York or Washington has as many datelines as London . <P> La Prensa 's front page is solid ( save for a small box for important headlines ) with classified ads . So , usually , are the following six pages-one reason the paper nets a million dollars or more annually . Lately La Prensa has made some concessions to modernity : it now carries two comic strips , occasional news pictures . <P> Deliveries , Duels , Discussions . La Prensa will not deliver the paper to a politician 's office ; he must have it sent to his home . It will not call for advertising copy . No local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalism is more hazardous than the North American brand . La Prensa 's publisher and principal owner , Ezequiel Pedro Paz , Don Jos 's son , has twice been challenged to a duel . Because he is a crack pistol shot , neither duel was fought . Now over 70 , Don Ezequiel shows up at the paper punctually at 5 p.m. for the daily editorial conference with Editor-in-Chief Dr. Rodolfo N. Luque . Present also is his nephew and heir-apparent , handsome Alberto Gainza ( " Tito " ) Paz , 43 , father of eight and ex-Argentine open golf champion . Significantly , La Prensa 's owner-publishers visit their editor-in-chief and not vice versa.
