NO INDIVIDUAL man can any longer cope with the Presidency of the United States . No individual man can any longer even campaign effectively for the Presidency . For the number and variety of problems with which a President , or even a nominee , has to deal is so prodigious that only a diversified group of men can produce the words and actions that go by his name . The Brain Trust was not invented by Franklin Roosevelt ; every candidate must needs be surrounded by policy-formulators , speech-drafters , and deputy executives who extend and in large degree determine his public character . That is why it is important , in appraising a candidate who may soon become President , to appraise the men around him . Thomas E. Dewey calls his group the " Dewey Team . " He is the first to admit their importance to him . When I talked with him recently in his suite at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York ? where F.D.R. housed his Brain Trust in 1932 ? he said , " To act alone , a President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Aar to Zymosis . " He went on to list an enormous number of subjects and subdivisions of subjects on which he would have to be an expert . Then he expressed his own conviction in the sentence : " The great genius in the organization of modern government is in selecting people who know their subject , and who dare to give honest advice . " The Governor , who is not lacking in confidence , clearly believes that he has that genius . And certainly he has succeeded in luring into the service of New York State many men who could command far larger salaries elsewhere . For example , Tax Commissioner Alger B. Chapman gave up $100,000 a year to go with Dewey , and Charles B. Selles , the engineer who built the Persian Gulf Port during the war , gave up $150,000 a year to become Commissioner of Works and Highways . Of the men who have been closest to him in recent years , few will get high office if Dewey is elected . Many of them wo n't even go to Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? rationed out among forty-eight States . Yet these men will continue to advise Dewey , and thereby exercise a real influence on the destiny of America . Unlike the personal councils of former candidates ? and Presidents ? the Dewey Team does not function all together as a unit . Instead , it is made up of groups of men who are students of each particular subject , getting together and discussing their appropriate problems . These groups are not rigid entities , but are like interlocking directorates , with one or more members of each taking parr in the others . Outside experts are constantly called in by all of them . The Governor sits in on many of these discussions and is usually represented by his alter ego , Paul Lockwood , when he can not attend . The main cells of the multi-person Dewey brain are the foreign policy group . the politicians , the finance and taxation group , and other groups on agriculture , labor , military affairs , public health , and housing . In addition , someone is thinking for Dewey about every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Straus , who meets with the foreign affairs group and was a member of Dewey 's original ( 1939 ) brain trust , how all the information and policy recommendations were evaluated and co-ordinated . He replied , " It 's all done in Tom Dewey 's brain . " According to the admiring reports of Dewey 's intimates , this brain works somewhat like one of those incredible electronic calculators . Feed it a piece of information , and it instantly and simultaneously assesses it , adds it to the total of data already recorded , subtracts contrary evidence , multiplies by political significance , divides by opposing factions , files the complete record for easy future reference , and comes up with a tentative conclusion . At any rate the word tentative is the key to Dewey 's method . Though he likes to act with dramatic suddenness , the plans are always carefully made in secret , and he keeps his mind open until he has asked advice of many people . And he really does like his associates to speak bluntly in private , though woe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T 1-IE almost indispensable man on Dewey 's Team is Paul Evans Lockwood , a lawyer who joined him back in 193h and is now his secretary . Lockwood is Fidus Achates , Man Friday , Louis Howe , and Harry Hopkins rolled into one . It may be significant that physically he is the antithesis of the Governor . He is a big , heavy man with a round and ruddy face on the large expanse of which a small blond mustache is quite lost . Lockwood is genuinely genial ? he loves people and solving human problems . He is a bachelor who says , " I never had time to get . married . " His one absorbing passion is devotion to Dewey . Though he is heavy-footed , his mind works fast . He knows all the things the Governor knows and , in Dewey 's absence , can act forhim , because he thinks like him . He meets with all the different advisory groups ; and will , of course , go to Washington as the President 's principal secretary ? if , as , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focused on Dewey 's political team : the Triumvirate , they call themselves . Herbert Brownell , Jr. , John Russell Sprague , and Edwin F. Jaeckle are running the Republican party . Hugh Scott , the National Chairman , is ( until November at least ) a minor figure put in because he is a Pennsylvanian , to get away from the curse of New York , and to bolster up the Republican party in Pennsylvania , where a particularly noxious scandal has been threatening to bt:rst in Philadelphia 's city government . Victor Johnston , who was chief engineer of the spectacular Stassen machine in Wisconsin and is Stassen 's goodwill gift to the Dewey organization , wields more influence than Scott . Brownell is First Consul . A Nebraskan who went to the Yale Law School and thence into the practice of law in New York , he is an idealist in politics ; a slim , youngish man with a high balding dome , a long thin face , and the eyes of a devotee . He mastered the art of political management because that seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizenry has the right to an incorruptible , efficient , and forward-looking government . He has an ardent belief that Dewey will make the best President the American people ever had . Oddly enough , Dewey was once Brownell 's manager ? when the latter ran for the State Assembly in New York 's old 10th Assembly District in 1930 . " He lost , " the Governor told me , laughing . " The following year , he got a new manager and won . " As Republican National Chairman from 1944 to 1946 , Brownell set up , for the first time , a permanent national organization with a public relations division , and particular emphasis on co-ordination with the Congress . This is proving an asset now in Dewey 's campaign . Brownell holds the power of veto in the Triumvirate . Dewey trusts him to see to it that the political machinations of Sprague and jaeckle do not lead to unwise commitments . In fact , no one is allowed to commit Dewey . to anything ; his friends say that he was telling the literal truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you , unfettered by a single obligation or promise . . . . " I asked Russ Sprague how deals were arranged if this were true . Sprague grinned and said , " We can encourage high hopes . " Sprague is the master politician of the group . He is a handsome man of sixty-one who looks at least ten years younger , with a square tanned face and a powerful body . He inherited the position of boss of Nassau County from his uncle , Wilbur Doughty , and greatly enlarged the avuncular empire . Sprague has been called the father of county government because he wrote and put into effect the Nassau County Charter , which has been widely copied as a model of modern , centralized county government . He also got an iron grip on the county ; Tammany is sometimes defeated in New York ; Sprague is never beaten in Nassau . Ed Jaeckle of Buffalo , the third member of the Triumvirate , looks more like the picture of an old-time political boss . He is a huge , white-haired man of fifty-three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came up the hard way through the wards . Like the Roman Emperors of the East and West , he and Sprague divide the Empire State between them . Add to these three Paul Lockwood , Elliott Bell ( of whom much more later ) , James C. Itagerty , the amiable ex-reporter who handles Dewey 's press relations , and the Governor himself , and you have the general staff who won the battle of Philadelphia . Their grand strategy is worth a quick glance , because it is typical of the Dewey method . TI T HE groundwork was laid in 1944 . Dewey had expected to be nominated in 1940 ; the result was an awful shock to him . In 1944 , he changed his tactics from clamorous campaigning to apparently inactive acquiescence , and was nominated . His defeat in the election was no shock at all . Elliott Bell says : " We had few illusions of victory . . . thus the problem was to make a decent campaign , calculated to bring the minimum disruption of the war effort , the fewest worries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 1948 . " MAGAZINE From 1944 to ' 46 , Brownell , as national chairman , traveled all over the country , building up the Republican party ? and Governor Dewey . The actual pre-convention campaign began in March 1947 . From that time forward Brosvnell , Sprague , and Jaeckle met regularly to plan and promote . Though they acted as a unit , each of them took a certain sphere of action . Because he was the best known west of the Alleghenies , Brownell operated there ; Sprague took the entire East Coast ; and Jaeckle , who had been New York State chairman , went to work on the State machines . The Governor wanted to play hard-to-get as in 1944 , but Stassen soon smoked him out , and it became evident that they were going to need a lot of money . So Dewey called in his good friend Harold E. Talbott . When I asked Talbott for the story of his fund-raising , he was as coy as a cook with a favorite recipe . " I 'm not going to give away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so proud of the job he did in raising over half a million dollars to finance Dewey 's pre-convention campaign that he could not help giving me at least part of the story . Talbott is a tycoon and the son of a tycoon from Dayton , Ohio , but now lives in New York . He has been an officer or director of many manufacturing companies , and is now vice president of Talbott &; Co. , and chairman of the finance committee of Mead Corporation and Electric Auto-Lite , and a director of Chrysler and other concerns . He is also a sportsman who has held a high goal rating at polo . He has been raising money for the Republican party for twenty-five years , and knows who are the right people to approach ; and also knows the pitfalls . Talbott began by limiting contributions to $5,000. so that Dewey would not stagger under the obligation of enormous gifts . Then he started off to see his friends . His sates talk to his fellow industrialists was : " Taft is a good man ; Stassen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We ca n't afford to back the wrong horse after sixteen years . " Talbott raised money in every large city in the United States with the exception of Stassen 's strongholds , St. Paul and Minneapolis . One Westerner gave him a check for $5,000 , saying , " This is because I like you . Give it to Dewey , give it to Taft , or blow it on a babe . It 's yours . " Other men gave money to all the candidates , on the theory expressed in idealistic terms by Alfred P. Sloan of General Motors , who said : " These fellows have no money , and I think we who have should make it possible for them to state their case to the American people . " ( Some may have merely wanted to be on the right side whoever won . ) However , most of the contributions came because the donors were genuinely convinced that Dewey was a winner . The money was well spent . Dewey 's campaign was only a little more expensive than Senator Taft 's and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cherishes most came from a Stassen manager who said : " That so-and-so Talbott got his delegates for $3,000 apiece . Ours cost us $6,000 ; and his stuck . " ( Naturally , this does not imply any payments to delegates : the figures were based on total expenditures for radio , transportation , halls , secretaries , and other campaign expenses . divided by the number of sure delegates the candidates brought into the convention . ) Talbott is not going to Washington if and when Dewey wins , but the rumor is he wants to he Ambassador to England . He would make a fine figure of a diplomat , with his weathered sportsman 's face from which the keen blue eyes of the industrialist look with cynical wisdom . However , he will probably have to begin nearer the bottom of the diplomatic ladder . r im all its astute staff work , the Dewey campaign was no walkover . According to Brownell , Stassen introduced a new technique into national politics ? the house-to-house canvass . And he scared the daylights out of the Deweyites . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Wisconsin was calamitous . Nebraska and Pennsylvania were no help . Dewey 's selling point was that he was a vote-getter , and he was n't getting votes . It was the nadir of his fortunes ; even Talbott 's oases of money dried up . " But Wisconsin was really a break for us , " one of Dewey 's team told me . " If Dewey had not gone out there and seen for himself , he would never have consented to campaign in Oregon . If he had n't done that , we 'd have been put up in mothballs . " Oregon , with only twelve delegates , saved the day . The Dewey men admit that if they had lost there , they were through . The campaign they put on was like General Patton 's Third Army going through France . Paul Lockwood took personal charge on the spot : the Triumvirate machinated furiously ; and money was poured in , though not in anything like the rumored amount . The unique thing was the letter-writing campaign . Big shots in New York were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyers to lawyers , doctors to doctors . business men to their opposite numbers . The bankers ? headed by Winthrop Aldrich ? were especially energetic ; as one man put it , " They really put the screws on the boys in Oregon . " Then the Governor himself went out and put on a crossroads campaign . As one of his friends said , " Dewey really ran for county sheriff in Oregon , and lie got elected . " The climax was the debate . Dewey was dog-tired that night and had a bad cold ; but the one-time District Attorney was still good enough to make Stassen look like the captain of a high-school debating team . When they counted the ballots , Dewey had proved his point : he could get the votes . 0 THEY moved on to Philadelphia in the last week of June . Elliott Bell went ahead to help Senator Henry Cabot Lodge write a platform Dewey could accept . The rest moved in over the weekend . For the first time in history , the ladies ran a major candidate 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane Todd , and the Deweys ' friend and neighbor Mrs. Carl T. Hogan were the managers tinder whom worked one hundred women volunteers . In addition there were over one hundred men volunteers . These people paid their own way ; they slept in tourist camps , on sofas and floors , and even commuted from New York . The staff work was carefully planned . Each volunteer was assigned certain delegates to whom he was to pay particular attention ; and so complete was the coverage that not a delegate was left unturned . In addition , Dewey personally saw every delegate who asked for an interview . The Executive . Headquarters was upstairs on the eighth floor of the Bellevue Stratford . Virtually the whole Dewey Team was there . The former Young Republicans of Dewey 's first political contacts rallied around ; and the assistant district attorneys of the racketbusting days turned up in a body , even to Frank Hogan , now Democratic District Attorney of New York , who said rather shyly , " I know I do n't exactly belong here , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic compromise nomination for Surrogate of New York , because lie would not run against a Republican ticket headed by Dewey ? a fact which lent plausibility to the Governor 's boast to me that " there are no former Dewey men . " In those crowded hotel bedrooms , the plans were laid for a chain reaction of events that was to blow the lid off the Convention . The week before , old Joe Grundy , the semi-retired boss of Pennsylvania , had seen the writing on the wall , and it said " Dewey . " He tried to get Governor Duff to hop aboard the bandwagon , and when Duff stood firm for Vandenberg , he whistled off to Washington and enlisted Senator Ed Martin of Pennsylvania . When Halleck of Indiana heard of this deal , he reported aboard Dewey 's craft . The Dewey staff timed Martin 's break for Tuesday and Halleck 's for Wednesday . Governor Driscoll of New Jersey also swung to Dewey , and the Dewey staff floated a lot of rumors about other breaks . This started a stop-Dewey coalition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree on a man . The first ballot on Thursday showed Dewey with 434 votes . On the second ballot he moved up to 515 , 33 short of a majority . This gain xcas in drabs and driblets , showing the value of the system of individual attention to delegates . It is generally supposed that it was all over after the second ballot ; but this is not true . In a last desperate conference , Stassen , Taft , Warren , and Duff agreed on Vandenberg . Then Colonel Robert R. McCormick , the arch-isolationist , spoke : " If you vote for Vandenberg , give Illinois to Dewey . " That cracked it . The opposition leaders jostled each other to get up on the platform and surrender to Dewey . But Colonel McCormick was not there . Rather than vote for the man he hated second only to Vandenberg , . McCormick walked out of the meeting and MAGAZINE out of the hotel and kept right on going to Chicago . His alternate voted for Dewey on the unanimous third ballot . Thus the Triumvirate triumphed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , they are not destined to go on to Washington , even if that larger battle ends as they expect it to . Both Sprague and Jaeckle prefer to rule unchallenged in their own bailiwicks , and Dewey will no longer need their special skills after November 2 . Herbert Brownell , however , is another matter . He says ? sincerely , I believe ? that he would like to remain with the law firm of Lord , Day and Lord , but Dewey will need him in Washington and will be pretty sure to have his way . III T HE most important of all Dewey 's consulting groups is that on foreign affairs . These men were the first Dewey Brain Trust , whom the late George Z. Medalie gathered together in 1939 , to prepare his thirty-six-year-old protege ? for the Republican nomination of 1940 , " in case the lightning should strike . " They are John Foster Dulles , Elliott Bell , Roger Straus , and John E. Burton . Dulles is , of course , the most important . Of him Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectual , spiritual , and moral force . He is the only man of first rank who has spent his entire life , since childhood , in foreign affairs . " And the statement is not readily countered . Dulles first entered the diplomatic arena , aged nineteen , as Secretary of the Chinese Mission to The Hague in 1907 . His grandfather , John W. Foster , who as President Harrison 's Secretary of State had helped to end the Sino-Japanese War , got hint the job . From that time forward , he was always in the world welter . He met Woodrow Wilson , whom he greatly admired , at Princeton , and Wilson later utilized his abilities even though Dulles was a Republican . He was a special agent of the State Department in Central America in 1917 ; assistant chairman of the War Trade Board , handling foreign economics , in 1918 ; and in 1919 he was the principal American spokesman on reparations at the Peace Conference . In that capacity the young man of thirty presented the American argument against enormous , unpayable reparations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simmer of England , Hughes of Australia , Klotz of France , and Salandra of Italy . After the peace , Dulles practiced in the field of international law with the New York firm of Sullivan and Cromwell . Succeeding Presidents and Secretaries of State called on him for advice on public finance and international loans . He worked out the Polish Stabilization Plan and helped to draw up the Dawes Plan . Since 1937 , Dulles , who is a strongly relio-ioUS man , has done much work with church r , groups . " After seeing the collapse of political efforts , " he says , " I felt that any permanent good in keeping the peace depended on mobilizing moral forces . " Dulles sought Dewey 's acquaintance in 1935 , with the thought of bringing the brilliant young Special Prosecutor into Sullivan and Cromwell . Dewey decided for public life , but the two men became friends . Dewey frequently sought the older man 's advice and , when he began to seek the Republican Presidential nomination , he brought Dulles into his advisory group . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their arguments were hot and heavy . Bell and Straus were all-out internationalists . Dulles , at that time , was opposed to America 's entry into the war . He told me that his reason was his belief that wars are seldom an effective means to achieve idealistic purposes . " It 's an evil method ? though it may be the lesser of two evils , " he said . " War 's train of immorality , hypocrisy , deceit , and savagery destroys the noble ends you seek . " Dulles feels today that the real difference between the Russians and ourselves lies not so much in our stated objectives as in the fact that they completely approve of war as an instrument of policy . By 1941 , Dulles had chosen the lesser of two evils ; but he sharply criticized the AtIantic Charter for omitting all mention of a world organization , and through his church groups he helped to mobilize public opinion behind the principle of the United Nations . During the Presidential campaign of 1944 , Dewey sent Dulles to advise with Secretary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the genesis of the bipartisanforeign policy . At the same time the Governor begged Senator Vandenberg to see Dulles , despite their political antipathies . Of that meeting Senator Vandenberg once said to me : " I thought it was going to be a complete waste of time . Within fifteen minutes we both , I think , had the highly illuminating experience of finding that a so-called isolationist and a so-called internationalist could find a common ground on which to meet with complete respect and mutual confidence . From that day to this , we have been not only in perfect harmony . but we have had the most priceless kind of personal friendship . " Vandenberg made Dulles his advisor at San Francisco ( much to President Roosevelt 's annoyance ) ; and through the Senator and Stassen , Dulles did much to liberalize the Dumbarton Oaks agreement into something less like a great power alliance and more of a real world organization . They introduced the concept of law and justice into the Charter , though these words were never mentioned in the Dumbarton Oaks agreement . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on foreign policy . They refer to themselves as " the Trio " and . act as a unit . In addition , Dulles consults frequently with Secretary of State Marshall to co-ordinate the bipartisan foreign policy ; and regularly receives full reports from the State Department even during the campaign ? although since a good deal of American diplomacy , especially in Berlin , is conducted by the Military and the National Security Council , the co-operation is not quite as good as it sounds . J OHN FOSTER DULLES is a tall , stoopshouldered man , with a forbidding manner and a rocky Puritan profile . However , if something delights him , his features fall apart into a disarming grin . When I talked with him recently , I told him that many people recognized Dewey 's executive ability , but questioned his knowledge of foreign affairs , and asked for a comment . Pacing the floor of his office , Dulles slowly dictated : " Dewey has a knowledge of foreign affairs that is equaled by few people whom I know . Over the last ten years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statesmen , both foreign and domestic , and he has questioned them closely and come to reasoned conclusions based on a wealth of factual information . " Then Dulles abruptly swung around to face me and his face dissolved into that grin as he said , " Furthermore , I really mean it . " Unless the unexpected should happen on November 2 , Dulles is about to achieve his lifetime ambition ? he will definitely be Dewey 's Secretary of State . When that time comes , he expects that " the Trio " will carry on with even closer intimacy because of the added responsibility . However , Dewey has no intention of abdicating either power or responsibility . In our conversation at the Roosevelt , he said very pointedly to me , " The Constitution directly charges the President , not the Secretary of State , with the conduct of foreign affairs . " R ( ) GER WILLIAMS STRAUS is another Dewey advisor with a considerable diplomatic background . His father , Oscar Straus , had the unique record of baying been appointed United States Minister to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one Democrat . He also served as Secretary of Commerce and Labor ( before it was divided into two departments ) under Theodore Roosevelt . Roger Straus grew up in the atmosphere of statecraft . He was an ardent admirer of the first Roosevelt , and acted as his office boy in the 1912 Bull Moose Convention . He says that Dewey 's methods are more like T. R. 's than those of any other public figure lie has known . For example , Dewey would always rather talk to a man than get a letter from him . Though he is one of the Macy Strauses , Roger has made his career in the American Smelting and Refining Company ; he went into it shortly after his graduation from Princeton , and is now Chairman of the Board . Through the vast ramifications of his company , which has interests in all parts of the globe , Straus is in constant touch with industrialists of all nations . In eighteen months , shortly after World War II , he traveled 60,000 miles , checking up on company properties and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a handsome , gray-haired man , with a clear , tanned skin and a warm , friendly MAGAZINE manner , has been an intimate friend of Dewey 's since 1935 , and the Governor sets great store by his tolerant sagacity , both in politics and foreign affairs . Straus , who is a leading figure in Jewish welfare work , and has written considerably on religious liberty , is especially enthusiastic about the Governor 's method of handling minority problems in New York State ; he says Dewey does it effectively with no flag-waving . He put through the Anti-Discrimination Law in New York State , and then picked first Henry Turner and afterward Charles Garside to run the Committee . Those two men did a wonderful job of enforcing the law by reason and conferences . They made it work , where a politically ambitious man could have wrecked the whole thing by hauling people into court just to get his name in the papers . " Though Straus has been in Republican politics all his life , he has never sought office and insists that he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dewey Team becomes Ambassador to England , it should he he . John E. Burton , formerly of Bloomfield , Ohio . was brought into the Dewey group in 1938 by George Medalie , who searched for three months to find the best research man that could be had . Though only thirty-four at that time , Burton had already proved himself in this field as executive secretary of the Institute of Economic Research and director of research of the Mortgage Commission of the State of New York . Medalie found him lecturing on economics at New York University . Burton set up a research bureau for Dewey in 1938 , and has done so in each campaign since then . His friends say that he is one hundred per cent accurate , an able student of government , and very stubborn ? a determined no-man . In his moments of relaxation he likes to fish and drive automobiles very fast . Being a Dewey career man ? he is now the New York State director of the budget ? he will certainly go to Washington as head of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be at a premium . 0 N EXT to Paul Lockwood , Elliott Bell is the man closest to Dewey . They have been friends ever since 1928 , when Dewey , recently out of law school , was earning $3,000 a year , and Bell ? a New Yorker who had graduated from Columbia in 1925 ? was representing the Herald Tribune on the " bank run " in the financial district . The Deweys and the Bells lived near each other and had a mutual taste for serious discussions on the Romanesque politics and fantastic finance of the bull market days . As bust followed boom , the ties of friendship strengthened . Bell was now on the financial staff of the New York Times , and Dewey soon became an Assistant U. S. District Attorney under Medalie . In 1939 , Bell resigned from the Times to help Dewey ; and went on to write Willkie 's financial speeches . When the 1940 campaign ended in defeat , Arthur Sulzberger asked Bell to join the editorial staff of the Times at an excellent salary . On a spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fifth Avenue while Dewey begged Bell to come and help him in the coming gubernatorial campaign . Bell felt he could not let Sulzberger down again , but offered Dewey his nights . For the rest of the summer and fall , Bell wrote editorials for the Times by day ; then went to the Barclay Hotel where he worked from 3 until 6 A.M. on Dewey 's campaign . When Dewey was elected , he emphatically wanted Bell in Albany and offered him the post of greatest interest to him , superintendent of banks . Bell refused it so many times it is a wonder Dewey did not give up . The newspaperman knew that here was a Rubicon . Bell had great prestige on the Times : his work was known and praised by many financiers and economists of standing ; and it was pleasant work , easy and well paid . This would he the end of that career ; Bell would be tying his fortunes to Dewey , to stand or fall with him . Nevertheless , he finally succumbed to Dewey 's fervor and the Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now Bell meets with the Dulles group , the financial group , and all the other most intimate Dewey councils . His most important assignment is helping Dewey with his speeches . The usual method of procedure is that first a particular subject is agreed upon by one of the groups . Then Burton produces the raw material , and he and Bell talk it over with the Governor . Lockwood , and ( usually ) Jim Hagerty . Experts are often called in . Dewey suggests the points he wants to make . Thinking , germination , and gestation follow . Then Bell , or possibly some expert , writes a rough draft . Bell brings it along as far as possible and hands it over to the Governor . After that anything may happen . The speech may only be edited , with interpolations ; it may be partly rewritten , or some phrase may start the Governor 's mind on a tangent and he may dictate an entirely different speech . Sometimes they just say to each other , " This stinks . " and tear it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . Though she resolutely hacks out of the limelight . she has a keen political mind . The Governor says that she reads every speech , blue pencils them , and appends comments ? frequently , " I do n't like this . " Elliott Bell is an energetic man , with crisp coppery hair . A slight curvature of the spine does not keep him from being an expert skier and a good athlete or from conveying an impression of lively vigor . Despite his thoughtfulness , he has the newspaperman 's ironic humor . Bell will certainly go to Washington . He would like to be Secretary of the Treasury , and his ability and financial knowledge fit him for the post ; but the political difficulty of giving both State and Treasury to New Yorkers make his appointment unlikely . More probably he will get something like Under Secretary of the Treasury or Director of the Budget . In that case , it would not be surprising if he exercised more influence than the actual Secretary of the Treasury . His financial philosophy , though more conservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be expected to advocate a determined attack on inflation , a real effort to balance the budget , a more attractive rate on government bonds , closer co-operation between business and government , and a scientific study of the entire economic structure of the country with a view to gradual modernization . IV T Ht. financial advisory group inevitably includes Bell , Burton , and Al Chapman . The last of these , who is certainly the handsomest member of the Team , is a tax lawyer whom Dewey persuaded to devote his talents to writing tax laws instead of helping people to circumvent them . Chapman is loath to go to Washington , but whether he does or not , his knowledge will certainly be available in unscrambling the federal tax laws omelette . The financial group calls in more experts than any other , and also appraises suggestions made to the Governor by friends in all parts of the country . The other advisory groups are less homogeneous . Rather than discuss matters among themselves , the individual members are more apt to consult singly with Dewey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the AF of L , Edward Corsi , the New York State Commissioner of Labor , Bill Edwards , and Merlyn Pitzele , a former CIO organizer and labor editor of Business Week , whose thinking represents the younger element in the labor movement . On military matters , Governor Dewey was impelled for a time by personal loyalty to rely largely on General Hugh A. Drum , whose military thinking seemed to many people to be a couple of wars behind the parade . Since his nomination , however , Dewey has induced General Eisenhower to become an ex-officio , non-political member of the Team . One of Dewey 's first moves as President will be to straighten out the tangle into which the unification of the armed services has fallen . Two other individuals , who do not belong in any group , are very influential in shaping Dewey 's policies . Charles D. Breitel , counsel to the Governor , looks like a rosy-cheeked young neophyte , and actually is a toughminded , experienced legal veteran . Dewey characterizes him as " the ablest lawyer I 've MAGAZINE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relies on Breitel for all legal advice , and has great respect for his judgment on any question whatever . He looks like the next Solicitor General . The other influential figure is Miss Lillian Rosse , who for fourteen years has been Dewey 's private secretary . She handles the Governor 's enormous personal mail , sifting out for him the most important letters . She knows virtually all the Governor 's friends through their correspondence , though she seldom meets them ; by her intuitive sense , she sometimes knows them better than Dewey does himself . She will be an indispensable member of the President 's official family . Whether GOvernor Earl Warren will become a member of the Dewey Team is a matter of doubt . Presidents have frequently promised to take Vice Presidents off the substitutes ' bench , but no one has yet overcome the constitutional difficulties . The Governor himself says that Warren 's role " will have to evolve " ? which may mean that Warren will wither on the vine . However , Dewey will undoubtedly try to draw some members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to promote the sort of liaison with Congress that he has maintained with the State Legislature . These , then , are the key figures of the Dewey Team , though associated with them are dozens of other able men and women .
