Labor in defense industries will largely depend on Philip Murray . Mild-mannered , tough as a rizzar and as sure of himself as any Scot , Murray declared at C. I. O. 's recent , raucous convention : " C. I. O. assumes complete jurisdiction over every major defense industry in the U. S. " <P> Last week , beginning his new job as C. I. O. 's president , Murray took hold of his problem . <P> Settled was the Vultee Aircraft strike at Downey , Calif. , which had dragged on through twelve days of haggling , had held up $84,000,000 worth of U. S. Government and British orders for training planes . Its chief organizer was slick , veteran Wyndham Mortimer , of United Automobile Workers . Just before a settlement was reached R. J. Thomas , president of the auto workers , carried to the strikers some strong words of advice from Murray and the Defense Commission 's Sidney Hillman . The final terms raised the basic pay of workers from 50 to 62 an hour , provided for 16 months of operation at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lockouts on the part of management . Employes lost twelve days ' work , $203,240 in wages , gained an annual boost of $1,315,000 . <P> Also settled was a strike in the Aluminum Co. of America plant at New Kensington , Pa . When middleaged , belligerent Employe Fred Ross objected to paying up his union dues and the management refused to cooperate by firing him , union men struck . Idle for a week were 7,500 men . Again Murray and Hillman interceded . Ross was transferred to the company 's plant at Logan 's Ferry . C. I. O. strikers , having lost an estimated $250,000 in wages , returned to their jobs , resumed work on aluminum orders required in defense production . <P> Signs of a new , sane policy under Murray came none too soon , for : <P> &gt; A new anti-strike bill was offered in Congress by Virginia 's Congressman Howard H. Smith . It provided life sentences for saboteurs , outlawed the closed shop in defense industries , required a 30-day notice of intention on the part of strikers . <P> &gt;Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry Bridges , West Coast longshoremen 's leader , often accused of being a Red . <P> &gt;A voluminous Dies Committee " Red Paper " reiterated charges of widespread Communism in Labor 's ranks , particularly in shipping , communications , transportation , and munition plants , made new charges of Reds in the aircraft industry . Mortimer and Lewis H. Michener , fellow organizers of the Vultee strike , were both accused of being Reds . <P> Murray , anxious to preserve Labor 's gains , make new ones , at the same time save Labor from a witch hunt , had his work cut out .
