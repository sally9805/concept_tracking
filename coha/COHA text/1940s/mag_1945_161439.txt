The Stork Club ( Paramount ) would be just another slightly silly cinemusical if it were not for a super-amiable performance by Barry Fitzgerald and a super-dynamic one by Betty Hutton . Fitzgerald has a chance to play rich and poor , stingy and generous , angry , whimsical , sour and wistful . Betty Hutton is permitted to make funny faces , wear a bathing suit and imitate the voice of Walter Winchell . Her songs are undistinguished but her uninhibited way of putting them over is an eclectic mixture of Harlem and Bali , with a shout from the heyday of Ethel Merman and a gesture from the childhood of Shirley Temple . <P> The late Robert Benchley makes a genial appearance in the film , but unhappily his lines were provided by someone less talented than Benchley at writing a Benchley role . The Stork Club 's Sherman Billingsley ( played by Bill Goodwin ) should be gratified by his screen portrait : he is pictured as handsome , witty , kindly , generous to a fault and extravagantly admired by all his own employes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stork Club is no substitute for a visit to a night club . But it is a good way to see : 1 ) what Barry Fitzgerald can do with even a thin role , and 2 ) how Betty Hutton can almost put over a hopeless lyric . <P> They Were Expendable ( MGM ) is an adaptation of William L. White 's best-selling war book of 1942 . On the screen it is a leisurely story of how the small PT boats put up a big fight around the Philippine Islands . The fight is carried on by a squadron of heroes skippered by smooth , hard-hitting Lieut . Robert Montgomery* and rough , romantic Lieut , ( j.g . ) John Wayne . Captain John Ford , who produced and directed the picture , allowed his men to be much more natural than most Hollywood heroes , kept his music low , achieved a feeling of reality rare in war films . But where Author White 's Expendable was short and timely , Captain Ford 's is long and late . <P> <P> For the most part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expert direction , some beautiful camera work , and excellent performances by the principals keep it from dragging . Working for Director Ford ( The Informer , The Grapes of Wrath ) , actors always seem to be more like themselves-or at least more like human beings-than they are in other pictures . <P> No one in Expendable has to say or do anything embarrassingly mushy or heroic . No one has to crack any bad jokes : Characters are brought in without formal introduction and bowed out before the audience gets to know them well . Human relationships are indicated sharply but briefly . In trying to steer between war melodrama and straight documentary reporting , Expendable beats a middle course through waters that are too rough for speed . <P> The Man in Grey ( Gainsborough-Universal ) is a heavily romantic , British-made melodrama tailored for the matinee trade . Adapted from a sugary , swashbuckling novel by the late Lady Eleanor Smith , it is a Regency costume piece containing all the time-tested materials : a gypsy fortuneteller ; a scowling , black-browed villain ; a gushy diary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violets ; a wavy-haired hero with beautiful strong teeth ; a fire-breathing adventuress who dotes on discord and low-cut gowns .
