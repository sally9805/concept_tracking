Already twice blessed by the meat shortage and by exceptionally rich catches ( 187,000,000 lbs . last year ) , the Portuguese fishermen of Gloucester ( Mass. ) and their boats were blessed anew last week . It was a high point in a week 's celebration of the 55th anniversary of the Church of Our Lady of Good Voyage . <P> As the 31 bells of the church carillon pealed , 400 swarthy fishermen in their Sunday best , followed by a score of clergy , made their way from the church to the fish pier . Archbishop Richard J. Gushing of Boston , in scarlet , purple and gold vestments , mounted a flag-decked platform facing the 24 draggers tied up together , with pennants fluttering in a stiff breeze . In his stentorian voice , which made the giant loudspeakers superfluous , the Archbishop said : <P> " The Son of God Himself took part in this honorable employment . . . . And when He commissioned His Apostles He said to them : ' I will make you to be fishers of men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storms let loose , the fisherman beholds as does no one else the awful majesty of nature . . . and the ears of faith hear once again the old command . ' Peace , be still . ' " <P> Then , shaking toward the boats drops of holy water from a silver aspergillum , the Archbishop read the blessing : " Deign. 0 Lord , to hear our supplications and bless these ships . . . and all who sail therein . . . . Extend to them Thy right hand as Thou didst to Peter walking upon the sea , and send Thy holy angel from Heaven to protect and guard them from every danger . . . . " <P> After the Archbishop 's blessing , fishermen and clergy went about the business of consuming 400 pounds of lobster , ten bushels of steamed clams , 1,000 pounds of boiled codfish and corresponding quantities of beer and wine .
