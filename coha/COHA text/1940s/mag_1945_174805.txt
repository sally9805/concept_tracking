The U.S. State Department 's decision to allot 500,000 tons of petroleum to Argentina was no oil on troubled Pan-American waters . <P> The thought of sleek Argentines purring over the pampas at a prewar clip while U.S. motorists were rationed and Brazilians burned charcoal sparked a widespread resentment . The Washington Post called the deal " snubbing our friends and favoring our enemies . " <P> Acting Secretary of State Joseph C. Grew last week explained the oil deal : 1 ) the petroleum shipments were in exchange for vegetable oils , which Argentines are now using as fuel ; 2 ) 80% of the petroleum would be transported in Argentine tankers . <P> Cried one U.S. diplomat : " Sure , Argentina has the ships . Why the hell should n't she have ? . . . Masters of the Argentine vessels carried safe-conduct papers issued by the German Navy . . . . Brazilian ships plied the same waters carrying critical war materials and 32 of the best ships flying the Brazilian flag were sent to the bottom . "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
