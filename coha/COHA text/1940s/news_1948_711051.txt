txt Following his vigorous speech of Jan. 22 with definite action , Foreign Secretary Sevin has now submitted to the French Government a draft treaty designed to form the basis for the creation of the West-European Union he then proposed . Simultaneously , Minister of State has arrived in Brussels to begin talks regarding such a , Union with the Benelux countries  --  Belgium , the Netherlands and Luxembourg . Thus a project which has stirred the imagination of some of the world 's greatest minds , aiSci the ultimate goal of which is a United States of Europe , has been transferred from the plane of academic discussion to that of actual diplomatic negotiations , which are to be extended to other countries later . As Mr. Begin said , the conception of the unity of Europe has already found well-nigh universal acceptance . The Bevin plan in particular has won the joint sponsorship of France and the endorsement of both the Benelux countries and the United States , at least in principle . Innumerable and serious obstacles remain to be overcome  --  the same obstacles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in contrast to tile American colonies which became the United States , Europe has never had a common sovereignty , and the diversity of its peoples , languages and economic conditions is equaled only by the diversity of its national antagonisms and ambitions , and the inertia of its long-established institutions .. Yet the pressures for union are now greater than ever before . Prime Minister Attlee 's statement that Europe must federate or perish was never more true . For today , in the age ofp mass production and super-Powers such as Russia and the United States , a divided Europe has proved itself unable to stand on its own feet . Economically , the national states of even western Europe have become too small to be efficient economic units , especially since their vast concentrations of population have become more than ever dependent on overseas food at a time when their overseas empires are beginning to recede . Politically there is no European state today that can hold Europe against the advance of the Russian power that has already swallowed half of that continent and is held in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is not too much to say that if these combined pressures fail ' to unite it Europe is doomed to a. long dependence on one or the other of the extra-European super-Powers . It is from considerations such as these that Britain as well as the Labor party abandoned their past policies and proposed the Bevin. plan . Its first objective appears to be military  --  to form bilateral alliances with as many European states as possible , modeled after the Anglo-French affiance already in existence . But both France and the Benelux countries are reluctant to agree to such pacts unless they are reinforced by parallel economic agreements , which are complicated by British Commonwealth commitments . However , under continental pressure , the British Foreign Office has announced that the military alliances are to be only the first step toward a greater economic rapprochement . Practical work along that line is already being done by both the Anglo-French Economic Committee and by the fourteen-nations study group for a European customs union that grew out of the Paris conference on the Marshall Plan . The Bevin plan has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Churchill , but also by the United Europe Movement , of which Mr. Churchill is the head , and which has formed a joint committee with three similar continental organizations . These are the European Union of Federalists , headed by Dr. Henry Brugmans of the Netherlands ; the Independent League for European . Cooperation , headed 14 Bald Van Zeeland of Belgium , and the French Council for a United Europe , headed by Edouard Herriot . Likewise , Working toward the same goal but qn an independent parliamentary basis , is the European Parliamentary Union , bedded by Count Coudenhove , Kalergi , one of the original champions of.Europeen unification . It held a preliminary meeting in astedd in Switzerland last September , and on the basis of favorable response from parliamentary deputies from fourteen states has called a constitutional assembly at Interlaken in Switzerland next September to draw up a federal constitution for the individual legislatures to ratify . The United States , which is doing everything possible to encourage European unification , will wish all these movements great success .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
