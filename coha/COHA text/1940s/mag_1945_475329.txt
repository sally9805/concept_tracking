LATE on the night of August 22 , 1943 , I stepped off a train at Howrah Sta- 4 tion in Calcutta . The city was blacked out , because at that time Japanese planes still were shuttling across the Bay of Bengal on occasional bombing raids . In the dim glow from the locomotive firebox , the station floor seemed to be paved with some kind of irregular black-and-white flagging . Then , as my eyes got accustomed to the steamy , stinking half-light , I saw that the floor was covered with huddled bodies , some wrapped in strips of dirty white cotton , most of them naked . They were crowded hip to hip , and as I picked my way toward the street / could n't help stepping on many of them . Only a few groaned or whimpered . Even the babies ? and there were hundreds of them ? lay limp and quiet , apparently too weak to cry . And it was plain that some of those people on the station floor were dead , and had been dead for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disposal Squad removed 112 bodies from the streets . More ? to this day nobody knows how many ? were taken away by charitable organizations and private citizens . Still others iay for days on the sidewalks and in gutters ; no one can tell the caste or religion of a naked cadaver , and naturally few Hindus , or Moslems either , cared to risk spiritual defilement by touching the body of a passible infidel or out-caste . The Statesman , one of India 's lead-ing newspapers and normally an apologist for the government , observed that " those who carry away the dead found in the streets do noble work , " and complained of the " red tape " which " necessitated their rotting publicly for hours or days . " That week , and for many weeks to follow , starving families continued to pour into Howrah Station and the great Maidan Park in the center of Calcutta and into every alley and doorway and air-raid shelter where there was room to lie down . The stronger ones fought for garbage around the curbing trash bins ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Englishman or American walked past . There was some talk of rationing and of prosecuting grain speculators ; the Great Eastern Hotel , where I lived , voluntarily cut its menu from eleven to nine courses ; and a few of the more extreme newspapers even suggested that the Calcutta racing season be suspended , so that the overstrained railway system might haul in rice instead of horses and fodder . Such irresponsible suggestions were , of course , given no consideration . Still the hungry came , because they heard rumors that the government might some day set up gruel kitchens in Calcutta , and because the famine was still worse in the country districts . An official of the Friends ' Ambulance Unit reported from Contai that " a fight between vultures and dogs over a corpse is no rare sight . . . there are not enough able-bodied men to burn the dead , which often are just pushed into the nearest canal . " Many desperate families offered their female children for sale . One rupee , eight annas , or about forty-five cents , seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ten years old , if she was still in good enough condition to stand alone . Through all these months the white Brahmin cattle wandered by the hundreds through the streets of Calcutta , as they always have , stepping placidly over the bodies of the dead and near-dead , scratching their plump haunches on taxi fenders , sunning themselves on the steps of the great Clive Street banks . No one ever ate a cow ; no one ever dreamed of it . I never heard of a Bengali Hindu who would not perish with all his family rather than taste meat . Nor was there any violence . No grocery stall , no rice warehouse , none of the wealthy clubs or restaurants ever was threatened by a hungry mob . The Bengalis just died with that bottomless docility which , to most Americans , is the most shocking thing about India . How many died ? No one , of course , really knows . By October , when Lord Wavell took over the government and finally set the army to distributing food on a systematic basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some ten thousand a week . The official figures were much lower ; many calculations by private relief organizations were higher . None pretended to be entirely accurate or complete . After comparing many different estimates , my own guess ? and I believe it to be conservative ? is that the 1943 famine , plus the epidemics of malaria , smallpox , dysentery , and dengue fever which followed in its train , probably wiped out about three million people . s . THERE were no reliable statistics on the 11. famine , there were at least plenty of explanations . The Indian Nationalists blamed the British ? with some justice , since the Central Government in India is one of the feeblest and most ineffective ever endured by a major nation . Even the English editor of the Statesman described the famine as " the worst and most reprehensible administrative breakdown in India since the political disorders of 1930-31 , " and added : Under the present system of government , responsibility for breakdown inescapably rests upon Authority in Britain , and its immediate representatives here . Every British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of the British blamed the corruption and bickering of the native provincial politicians ? again with some accuracy , since most of the honest , patriotic , and able native leaders were in political prisons , not provincial ministries . Everybody blamed the floods which disrupted the main rail lines into Bengal , the hurricane which had devastated farms along the east coast , and the Japanese who had cut off rice imports from Burma . In each of these explanations there was unquestionably much truth . Yet beneath them all lay another fact more ominous , more difficult to cure . It is simply this : there are too many Indians . II HE RE are some 400 million of them as many people as there are in all of Europe , aside from Russia . They are crowded into a land which can not at the moment support half that number on what most Americans would regard as the barest level of decency . For every square mile of farm land , there are 423 Indians ; and eight out of ten depend for their living on farming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in modern industries ; while 3 or 4 per cent more sweat out some kind of living in cottage industries and handicraft trades . ) Moreover , the Indian peasant is one of the worst farmers in the world . His methods are incredibly primitive ; his soil has been drained of its fertility for centuries ; his yields are far below the world average . His farm is rarely larger than five or ten acres ; his plow is a crooked stick dragged by a water buffalo ; his home is a one-room mud hut , which is quite likely to wash away every rainy season . Normally he is up to his ears in debt , on which he may pay up to 100 per cent interest , and he could not afford better equipment if he wanted it . He seldom does ; the old ways seem best , just because they are old and probably sacred . The result of all this is that more than half of all the people in India are always underfed . Probably 80 million of them never once get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Once I threw a banana peel out the window of a train to a monkey sitting on a station platform . The monkey never got it ; a pack of naked brown children beat him to it , and nearly clawed each other to pieces before the biggest one gulped it down . Not a banana just the skin ; and that was not a famine area . ) If you feed a rat on the diet of a Bengali peasant , the rat will die . So , of course , will the Indian , although not quite so soon ; his life expectancy is about thirty-two years . Yet every year there are 5 million more mouths which have to be fed , somehow , from India 's weary , eroded land . Since World War II began , the increase in India 's population has nearly equaled the total population of England . Within the past twenty years , it has amounted to more than the entire population of Germany . And if present trends continue until 1960 , India 's growth will reach the neighborhood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famines like that of 1943 are inevitable ? and they are likely to increase both in ire-. quency and severity . As long as the population continues to crowd so heavily on the thin margin of subsistence , any failure of the monsoon , any prolonged breakdown of transport is almost certain to sweep whole provinces over the edge of starvation . One Indian business man , who is neither cynical nor especially cold-blooded , summed it up in these terms : From a strictly economic point of view , the 1943 famine was a failure . At most , it killed only three or four million people , which means that it still lagged far behind the birth rate . And that means a few handfuls less rice for everybody next year . This relentless fertility , with all the economic consequences it entails , is the basic problem of India . The political problem , which is absorbing nearly all the attention of educated Indians and their British rulers alike , is ? I am convinced ? almost trivial in comparison . Like most Americans , Ihave a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that every people has a right to govern ( or misgovern ) itself any way it sees fit . Yet , for reasons outlined later in this article , I can not share the hopes of my Indian friends who see independence as the sole , sure-fire remedy for all their ills . Independence alone wo n't really solve anything ; perhaps its greatest blessing may he to relieve the Indian leaders from their preoccupation with British-hating , and let them buckle down to the long , hard job of getting India 's deteriorating economy back under control . To the Indian peasant , plagued with malaria , dysentery , and too many children , wondering every hour where his next mouthful of rice is coming from , it ca n't make much difference what flag flies over the Secretariat in Delhi ? not so long as India 's population goes on climbing at the rate of a steady 1.2 per cent every year . III Ts THERE any answer ? I Not from the British . I have questioned scores of English officials , from the Viceroy 's staff down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could see a way out . Typically , they shrug their shoulders and say something like this : After all , that 's not my pigeon . I 've got troubles enough in my own department ? and in five or six years I 'll be going home on a pension . Besides , we British do n't dare interfere with the native customs and religions which lie at the root of the population problem And there would be no use interfering anyway , because nobody can do anything with these Indians . Elie Congress wallahs can do the worrying when they finally throw us out , as I suppose they will one of these days . In short , a kind of tacit confession of Imperial bankruptcy . The surest indication that British rule in India is not likely to survive much longer , it seems to me , lies in this failure to face up to the essential tasks of government . A much more brutal , more tyrannical regime might last indefinitely , if it had some bold plan for grappling with the country 's fundamental troubles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tyrannical ; indeed , they often go to absurd lengths in a hopeless effort to placate their native critics . They are merely ineffectual ; they lack confidence in themselves ; they hold out no real hope that they can improve the lot of the average Indian ; and such governments seldom hang on long . It is true , of course , that in the past the Br itish Raj has made strenuous efforts ( in certain limited fields ) to fight off the constant threat of starvation . It has carried through the greatest system of irrigation projects in the world . It has built a rail network capable of shuttling food supplies from surplus to shortage areas , thus eliminating the minor , local famines . In addition , it has started a rudimentary public health program , which already has had a notable effect on the death rate . The net result has been merely a spurt in the rate of population growth ? especially in the period since 1921 , during which it has been the most rapid in the country 's history . Consequently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the average Indian ; it has just meant more Indians . It also is true that the government of India has set up an impressive array of postwar planning committees and agencies ; but so far they have produced no program of the heroic scope which the situation requires . Nor are they likely to . The purpose of these committees , I suspect , is primarily political . They are meant to serve as an answer to the far-reaching postwar proposals being pushed forward by the Indian National Congress . the Indian Nationalists have an an- swer , or think they have . Their solution for India 's economic nightmare is industrialization , plus a tremendous increase in agricultural production . It has been most widely publicized in the form of the Bombay Plan , a scheme of economic development drawn up by a group of the ablest and most powerful native industrialists . The objective of the Plan is to treble the national income within a period of fifteen years after the war . To reach this goal , farm output would be doubled , and industrial production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population growth during this period of 5 million a year the plan calculates that the per capita income would be doubled . Although the Plan itself does not go so far , most of its proponents argue along these lines : We realize , of course , that even these substantial gains in production can provide only a temporary relief for India 's grinding poverty , if the population keeps on rising at its present rate . Eventually , however , our population ought to stop growing of its own accord . That happens in every nation , as it becomes industrialized and raises its standard of living . It is happening right now in Great Britain , and it is beginning to happen in America ? although both of these countries grew even more rapidly during the last century than India is growing today . And there can be little question of India 's ability to industrialize herself in short order , once we throw off the dead hand of British Imperialism . Look at Russia ? with its Five Year Plans it built an even greater industrial plant in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most hopeful being uttered in India today . And they are based on more than hope . Unquestionably India has many of the raw materials for building a modern industrial state . Her deposits of high-grade iron ore , still only partially explored , may prove to be among the most valuable in the world . Bauxite , sulphur , manganese , mica , and many another industrial mineral are plentiful . Her rivers , pouring off the Himalayas and the Deccan Plateau , offer a tremendous water power potential , so far only about 4 per cent developed . ( But there also are serious gaps in the raw materials arsenal , as we shall see . ) Moreover , at least a few Indians have demonstrated a genuine capacity for industrial operations . The Tata steel mills , for example , are the largest in the British Empire , and some of their most modern departments operate more efficiently than any in the United States . Good machine tools are being made in India already ; and the country has produced more than a handful of competent engineers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the nation 's industrial leaders are almost fanatically determined to reach their goal . Mr. G. D. Birla , for example , insists that he will some day establish a full-fledged automobile factory in India , even though the scarcity of roads and purchasers may force it to operate at a loss for years on end . He is not really interested in profits ; he already is making plenty in a dozen other industries . To Birla , an auto factory is a symbol of national pride ? no modern state is complete without one . And he has his counterparts in many other fields , all bent on building some kind of factory virtually without regard to cost . The bitterest accusation that they hurl against the British is the charge that England has deliberately discouraged the growth of industry in India , to prevent competition with her own plants . All this adds up to a strong probability that India will accomplish a considerable degree of industrialization during the next generation , although not necessarily on the scale set forth in the Bombay Plan . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up substantially ; as much as 75 million acres of additional land might be brought under cultivation , and the use of fertilizers and better farming methods theoretically might double the yield from the present farms . IV EVERTHELESS , I do not think the Bom- bay Plan is likely to achieve its basic purpose : to create a higher standard of living by shoving production well ahead of the rise in population and keeping it ahead . In the first place , there are strong reasons to believe that the Bombay Planners set their sights too high , that a fivefold increase in industrial production can not possibly be carried through within fifteen years . And secondly , even if the Plan could be fulfilled down to the last ton of steel , there is little prospect that it actually would result in checking the cancerlike growth of India 's population . Indian Nationalists are fond of pointing to the Russian example , and in many respects the Bombay Plan is modeled frankly after the Soviet Five Year Plans . Like them , it calls for a massive investment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , machine tool factories , chemical and power projects ? within a very brief period . The Indians , however , are apt to gloss over the methods Russia had to use . The Soviets carried through their Five Year Plans by cutting sharply the consumption of the people and throwing the resources thus saved into a rapidbuilding up of capital equipment . That entailed a ruthless and efficient dictatorship , willing to plunge ahead regardless of the cost in suffering and human life . ow a Free India government is likely to find that it can not follow the Russian example , for four reasons : 1 . Although India 's natural resources are impressive , they do not include some of the key raw materials on which Russia ( and every other modern industrial state ) has built its economy . The most serious lacks are petroleum and coking coal . The coal shortage , in fact , has proved the most serious bottleneck in the Indian war effort , Production of coal still falls short of 25 million tons a year -- as compared with America 's 620 million ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northeast corner of the peninsula , so that its distribution involves long and costly train hauls. 2 . In Russia , even after the devastation of World War I and the Revolution , the people as a whole had a standard of living considerably above the subsistence level . There was some fat on the economy , which could be shaved off and diverted to the building of industrial plant . In India there is no such margin . Present living standards can not be hammered much lower ? for whatever worthy purpose ? without causing wholesale starvation . .3 . There is little prospect that a Free India would have a government strong enough to impose great sacrifices on its people , even if they had anything much to sacrifice . ( Many British officials predict that India could never form any stable government at all ; and the current deadlock between the Congress Party and the Moslem League makes it difficult to answer these predictions . ) At best , any independent Indian government is likely to be an uneasy coalition , constantly preoccupied with balancing and compromising the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and political groups . Such a government could not afford to act ruthlessly ; if it did , it would be tossed out of office overnight . On the other hand , if any one group ? such as the Congress Party ? should be able to dominate the government and should attempt to impose a drastic economic program on the other factions , the result quite possibly would be civil war . 4 . Finally , the Russians started their great experiment with an energetic people , braced by a rigorous climate and fairly bulging with a vitality which even such Americans as Wendell Wilikie and Eric Johnston have found a little overwhelming . In contrast , the great mass of the Indian people have been enervated for generations by hunger , tropical diseases ( at least 25 per cent have malaria ) , and a climate which will'almost wilt a bulldozer . No one who has not lived in India can quite imagine the effect of that climate ? a smothering , bone-melting heat , in which every movement requires a separate effort of the will . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate is a major obstacle to any plan for a rapid and vigorous reconstruction . It sweats the energy out of the Englishman in India , just as it does the native . It would du the same to you . j Er 's assume , however , that all these diffi- 4 culties by some miracle might be overcome . Suppose that the Bombay Plan could be carried out on schedule , and that all its most optimistic goals could be achieved . Would the resulting rise in living standards actually slam an automatic brake on the rate of population growth , as its supporters believe ? The answer almost certainly is no . By the end of its fifteen years , the Bombay Plan is intended to lift the income of the average Indian to 135 rupees , or $45 a year . It is true that this would be about double the present per capita income ; but even so , it would not amount to one-tenth of the earnings of the average American . It is hard to believe that an income of $45 a year would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in living standards , habits , and education which have been responsible for a declining birth rate in the Western world . Moreover , it is doubtful whether a rise in income ? no matter how large ? would have the same effect on India 's population trends that it has had in Europe and the United States . The simple rule of thumb , " Higher income = lower birth rate , " may not apply in India , simply because her culture , religions , and habit patterns are too different . First of all , the great emphasis which both Mohammedanism and Hinduism place on the family and on sexual relationships would probably rule out any widespread practice of birth control . The creation of a son is the first duty of every Hindu ; the sexual act itself is a religious rite . With many Indians , sex seems to have become almost an obsession . ( Witness the countless ? and admirably explicit ? volumes on the arts of love which crowd every bookstore ; the aphrodisiac advertisements in every newspaper ; the native state where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink marble . ) Doctors , missionaries , public health workers , sociologists ? Indian , British , and American all told me the same story : any attempt to change the Indian 's breeding habits can show results only after generations of persistent and tactful education . For these cultural patterns are more rigidly fixed , more resistant to change than those of any other major people . Indeed , the dominant characteristic of India is an inert , rocklike conservatism which the Western mind finds almost impossible to grasp . Consequently , it seems likely that a doubling of the per capita income under the Bombay Plan might well lead to a rising birth rate , rather than the expected decline . At the same time the death rate presumably would slump , since the Plan calls for a great expansion in sanitation and public health facilities . If this should prove true , the Bombay Plan then would arrive at precisely the same kind of result as the British-sponsored irrigation schemes ? a still faster population growth , a still sharper pressure on the means of subsistence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is borne out by the studies of two of India 's most competent and searching economists , P. A. Wadia and K. T. Merchant . In Our Economic Problem , one of the most painstaking analyses published in India in recent years , they conclude that " it is obvious that so long as we have a high birth rate , it is difficult to think of any immediate change for the better in our material cm:Atkin . We shall continue to grow at the rate of about 10 to 13 per thousand every year , unless our numbers are seriously affected . . by natural calamities . . . . The problem in the coining two or three decades will be that of the impact of a progressively increasing population on our ill-balanced and deteriorating economic and social structure . " DOES this mean that there is no solution for India 's economic problem ? So far as can see , it probably does ? at least for the predictable future . I arrived at this hopeless sort of answer reluctantly , over a period of many months , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ever undergone . When I went to India , I believed in a kind of inarticulate , unconscious fashion that there must be some kind of solution for every problem . Perhaps it might be only a theoretical solution , not immediately practical ; but with enough effort and good will it ought to be possible at least to figure out some line of attack on any set of difficulties . I think nearly all Americans feel the same way ? we 've never yet been up against anything we could n't lick , somehow . It was a considerable shock , therefore , to run into a situation to which I could not find even a theoretical answer . Nor anyone who believed , with real confidence , that he had the answer . ( Even the most enthusiastic of the Bombay Plan 's proponents have a few private doubts . ) And it was especially numbing to realize that this apparently insoluble problem may mean suffering and death on a staggering scale , for many generations to come . There is always a hope , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example , Jawaharlal Nehru , leader of the left wing of the Indian National Congress , has sketched the outlines of a program which would take into account many of the difficulties the Bombay Plan avoids , and would attack them in a much more drastic fashion . He demands a revolution ; and " revolution " is precisely what he means . The Nehru program proposes nationalization of heavy industry , collective farms to replace the present tiny peasantholdings , and ? by implication ? a frontal assault on the whole archaic social structure of India , with its incrustations of caste , superstition , and blind conservatism . Because Nehru has spent much of his mature life in prison , he has never had a chance to translate these proposals into a detailed , specific plan of action . In any case , there is no prospect that his program will get a trial within the foreseeable future , because the big industrialists who finance and dominate the Congress Party are implacably opposed . And during his present term of political imprisonment Nehru apparently has lost much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right track . Certainly some such bold and imaginative surgery would seem to be indicated . It is questionable , however , whether any revolution , however drastic , would be enough . How can India lift herself by her bootstraps , when there is n't enough strap to get hold of ? when there is so little margin beyond bare subsistence to use for the task of reconstruction ? The essential thing , which Nehru 's program ( like all the others ) seems to lack , is the injection from outside India of a tremendous stream of equipment and capital and technical skill . Incalculable amounts of money and energy would have to be poured out , first of all , on a campaign of education and public health in the thousands of Indian villages . Such a campaign in the very long run might bring the birth rate under control , clean up the malaria and cholera and typhoid , and prepare the Indian people physically and mentally to remake their own destiny . On top of that , more billions would be needed to get a modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs of 400 million people . The mere statement of these needs indicates how little chance there is of meeting them . No nation or group of nations would be willing to make such an investment , because much of it ? certainly that part spent on education and health ? could never be repaid . Furthermore , India would not be willing to accept really large-scale investment from abroad , because both business and political leaders are profoundly suspicious of foreign economic penetration . ( They are especially wary of American " dollar imperialism . " I know dozens of intelligent Indian business men who honestly believe that Lend-Lease is simply a subterfuge under which the United States is scheming to grab control , somehow , of the Indian economy . ) Even the Bombay Plan would permit foreign financing only to the extent of a little more than $2 billion over a fifteen-year period , and then only " if it is not accompanied by political influence or interference of foreign vested interests . " The best hope for a boost from overseas lies in the debt which Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized that during the course of the war India has substantially achieved her fin ancial independence from the British ? and more . Britain has purchased huge tonnages of raw materials from India ; since she could not pay in cash , she has jotted down a credit to India on her books , with a promise to pay at some unspecified date after the war . Long ago India piled up enough of these blocked sterling credits to wipe out all the debt she previously had owed England . The credits are still piling up , so rapidly that Britain probably will be in debt to India to the tune of $3 or $4 billion by the war 's end . If India could take payment for this debt in machinery and other capital equipment for her industrialization program , it might serve as a real help towards a new start . It seems more likely , however , that England will want to pay off as much as possible with consumers ' goods which would compete with , rather than aid , India 's fledgling industries . Some Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British will cheat them out of this money somehow , by outright repudiation of the debt or perhaps bysome juggling of the sterling-rupee exchange rate . So it appears probable that India will have to tackle her reconstruction largely on her own steam ? and it also seems evident that there just is n't enough steam there . His dismal account may at least cast some light on the peculiar behavior of a good many Americans who have been handling war jobs in India . When they arrive , they generally are more than eager to engage in the time-honored American pastime of British-baiting . Within a few weeks , as they get their first good look at the lackadaisical performance of the British bureaucracy , they pull out all the stops and voice their criticisms in a full-throated bellow . About six months later , however , something apparently happens to the vocal cords . The jibes tend to fade away to a whisper , and sometimes they stop altogether . The explanation , of course , is simple enough . Sooner or later , nearly every American begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run India ? and lapses into a thoughtful and chastened silence . ( After all , can we afford to brag about our record in Puerto Rico , which presents much the same problems on an infinitely smaller and more manageable scale ? ) One morning , during the worst of the hot weather , an American general sat down at my breakfast table looking uncommonly haggard and worn . He said he had n't slept well . " As a matter of fact , " he added , " I 've been having a perfectly horrible nightmare I dreamed that all the Englishmen quietly slipped out of this country during the night , and left us Americans holding the bag . Can you imagine anything worse ? "
