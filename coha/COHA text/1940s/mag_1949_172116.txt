In the sweltering evening , the shouts from the union hall on Kansas City 's Main Street could be heard almost a block away . There was a crash of glass , and some bodies hurtled out onto the tile roof . One man dropped to the lawn , then dashed back upstairs to rejoin the fighting . Congressmen Leonard Irving , who is also president and business agent of Kansas City 's Hod Carriers ' Building and Common Laborers ' Union ( A.F.L. ) , was talking things over with his rank &; file . <P> Democrat Irving has been the duly elected representative of Harry S. Truman and 250,000 other constituents of Missouri 's Fourth District since last November . A fortnight ago , in a court suit , 85 members of his union suggested that he was also a crook . <P> Two Cadillacs . Even before he became a $12,500-a-year Congressman , Leonard Irving had been living pretty well for a $125-a-week boss of Local 264 - each of whose 1,800 members had paid a $59 initiation fee for the right to dig a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( which President Truman did not support ) had been expensive . In Washington , he rented an eleven-room house on fashionable Marlboro Pike , sported two Cadillacs , and dressed like a Texas banker : <P> Led by one Theodore Baldwin , a Negro janitor who had been custodian at union headquarters , the disgruntled 85 in Local 264 accused Irving and two other officers of diverting union funds to their own use , and of spending large amounts on political campaigns ( presumably Irving 's ) . <P> The petitioners asked some probing questions . Why had " motor cars " been bought for Irving 's personal use ? Why , in one 14-month period , had Roy E. Livingston , union treasurer , been paid $4,400 and Irving $3,800 for " overtime " ? Why , in approximately the same period , had $16,762 been paid to " cash " without accounting ? Why had the union 's bank balance dropped by $37,000 in five months ? <P> " We 'll Get You ... " Last week Irving boiled out to Kansas City and called a meeting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had bought one Cadillac for his wife ; the other had been given him by the " unanimous vote " of the membership . He pointed out that Baldwin had been fired as custodian at union headquarters . Irving thought it " highly significant " that all but four of his critics were Negroes ( who comprise 40% of the union 's membership ) . <P> Rebel Baldwin gathered his supporters downstairs on the porch , getting minute-by-minute reports from the packed meeting room . Just before Irving rose to read his financial report ( it would have shown , Irving explained later , that the local 's net worth was a handsome $204,000 ) , Baldwin 's boys rushed upstairs . In the stifling room , bedlam broke loose . Men seized chairs , smashed them over the heads of their opponents . Knives flashed . One member leaped to protect Irving , was deeply slashed for his pains . Before the police arrived , 25 men had been cut . " We 'll get you at the next meeting , " yelled one man as Irving was escorted out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retorted " Two-Cadillac " Irving as he boarded a plane back to Washington , " until this thing quiets down .
