St. Peter &; Astrology <P> Sirs : <P> Not for purpose of correction but for your own information , I am offering the following comment on your very friendly account of myself in your issue of Sept. 23 . <P> At St. Peter , Minn , the working man who raised the query about Government spending had exactly the opposite intent from what is indicated . He was arguing for unlimited Government spending . In my reply I indicated that there was a limit to Government spending , and that when men were fully employed and the factories were busy , further increases in Government spending would bring inflation , lack of balance and eventual grief , especially to the farmers . <P> The other point has to do with astrology and numerology as hobbies . I never was interested in numerology . In the case of astrology , I was interested in the possible effect of the moon and the planets on weather . I obtained , therefore , the heliocentric longitudes of the planets from the Naval Ephemerises and the geocentric longitudes from an Astrological Ephemeris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was it possible that the angle of the planets to the earth might determine weather , or was it more probable that the angle to the sun might determine weather ? I was never able to prove either one definitively . <P> When the subject of astrology has been brought up , I have argued that a belief in astrology as a guide to life would lead to a fatalism that might cause many individuals to accept hard times as the foreordination of the stars , instead of struggling to master their fates . <P> Incidentally , I never drive a car at night , or any other time , to clear my brain . <P> I do not play tennis before 7:30 in the morning . <P> Oh , well ! - it is impossible to correct all the cockeyed stories . Moreover , it is obvious your slant is friendly , so I do n't mind . <P> HENRY A. WALLACE <P> Democratic National Committee Indianapolis , Ind . <P> - TIME 'S correspondent who was present at the curbstone colloquy in St. Peter evidently did not overhear correctly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIME is grateful. - ED . <P> Hitler at Buckingham Palace <P> Sirs : <P> Please note the enclosed picture from TIME , Sept. 23 , and explain how Hitler got to Buckingham Palace in time to help clear away the debris . Maybe he did n't miss the bus after all . . . . <P> CARL A. MCNAMEE Minneapolis , Minn . <P> - TIME concedes a resemblance ( see enlarged detail ) ; but evidently Britain 's King , Queen and Prime Minister ( in the same picture ) did not notice it. - ED . <P> President or Vice President ? <P> Sirs : <P> Prompted by your excellent article about Henry Wallace ( TIME , Sept. 23 ) , I am writing in the interest of establishing a historical fact . <P> When President Roosevelt accepted his nomination by radio in the early morning of July 19 , he made a slip of the tongue which may forecast history . <P> He said to the Democratic Convention , " I express my gratitude for the selection of Henry Wallace for the high office of President of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind about the slip . Five of us were listening to the address together . . . . <P> Freud respects the truth in tongue slips . . . . Personally , Henry is all right with me . <P> ROBERT GUNNING <P> Editor Every Week Columbus , Ohio
