The letter below came to TIME recently from one of you and may prove as interesting to the rest of you as it was to us : <P> <P> " Dear Mr. Linen : <P> <P> " In your letter on the average TiME-reader in the Aug. 9 issue of TIME I feel that you overshot a multitude of TIME-readers who I believe are the real readers of your worthy magazine . As one who can boast of reading each copy from kiver to kiver , I think I am in a position to question your idea of TiME-readers as you portrayed ' em . " To begin , I could n't afford a subscription to TIME . Liv ing on an income which has shrunk to infinitesimal value since this inflation hit the dollar ( Mr. B is an ex-Ma rine Gunnery Sergeant on retirement pay ) , we have all we can do to exist - let alone spend money for magazines . But we have some friends who know how much good read ing means to us and who send us their mag azines as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home in strange sequence : a 1936 copy of Reader 's Digest , for instance , hug ging a current issue of TIME . But it matters little to us ; we cherish each copy with the same joy we 'd have in receiving a crisp new $100 bill . And how we share our treasures with our neighbors ! That 's a tale in itself . <P> <P> " We live in a tiny , weatherbeaten shack back of the sand dunes , and we can peek at the ocean by stretching our necks a bit . Our neighbors are a motley crew : mostly men who seek only escape from their pasts , their responsibilities , or their sins . Whatever the reason , they 've found some sort of peace here on the beach . Until we began o circulate among them with our books and magazines , there was an undeclared war constantly going on . One had built a 10 ft. fence to keep out prying passersby ; one was a grouchy old codger who 'd scare you with his growl ; another read only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the camp were groveling in True Confessions , living in a misty world of make-believe and dreaming of the day they 'd be able to go back to civilization . We each lived our life oblivious of the one living next to us . <P> " One day my magazines had stacked up on ' me and I told the Old Sarge , T 'm going to bring some of these over to the old duffers . ' Sarge shook his head and said ' Do you want to start a riot ? ' But I persisted and at first I was n't too welcome ( ' Damn old hen come asnoopin ' ' ) . I let the insults slide over me and kept bringing the magazines . Now , believe it or not , I have the old devils talking to each other and we even have sessions of discussion on topics of interest . Some of the old rascals have scrimped and saved enough to get battery radios and now keep up with current events and national issues with as much interest as you do . The discussions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen in on some of these sessions than sit in on The Pursuit of Happiness round table which LIFE ran . These people are really pursuing happiness . They are trying to get the last drop of pleasure out of life . Yet they have changed their outlook considerably since they have good books and magazines to read . <P> " Now do n't get me wrong ; I 'm not a reformer . But I do feel that people like these , who really read your magazine , are worthy of a place as readers . They take a copy of TIME and read it from kiver to kiver.
