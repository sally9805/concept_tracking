N ... pg . 15 Letters to The Times Shortage of Nurses Recommendation Made for Lowering Entrance Requirements TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I have noticed a couple of letters lately concerning the shortage of student and graduate nurses , and as a practicing physician I have thought arid talked to the nurses in the hospital about this problem . There are several factors entering into this shortage . The first and probably the most serious barrier that a prospective nurse has to hurdle is that not only must she be a high school graduate who has had arithmetic and chemistry , but she must have , in addition , algebra , physics , biology and a foreign language or Latin . This means a college preparatory course and her high school curriculum is so full that such courses as typewriting , shorthand and bookkeeping , which would be most valuable to an office nurse for example , are , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel that a lot of these courses are unnecessary and that our object is not to have such highly trained nurses that they feel they are almost physicians but rather to have intelligent , willing student and graduate nurses who take pride in being the doctor 's assistant in carrying out orders and in giving bedside nursing care to patients . During the war medical schools , even those which required a bachelor 's degree , reduced their pre-medical requirements at the request of the United States Government to eighteen months or two nine months ' courses ( two years ) of pre-medical work . One reason the nurse 's entrance requirements are so stiff is that during the depression the nurses who fixed the requirements became panicky over the excess of unemployed nurses and they raised the requirements so high , hoping never to have such a condition again . They have now caused an acute shortage and it is time to lower their entrance requirements to a high school graduate with chemistry . Secondly , the present practice of requiring a student nurse to pay approximately $200 tuition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniforms and books is all wrong . The only thing she gets now is free laundering of her uniforms , free board and a room which is oftentimes poor . Contrast this with the habit of some fifteen or twenty years ago of free tuition , free books , free uniforms , free board and room and a monthly salary of $15 to $25 . Is it surprising in view of these facts that there is such a shortage of nurses ? I have talked to a number of intelligent young women from poorer families who have told me that one or both of the above factors had kept them from entering training . If giving more compensation to the nurses means increasing the daily hospital rate a little bit , then I feel that this must be done , or else increased donations or contributions must be solicited for the average hospital . Who in these times would think of asking a maid to work for her maintenance , much less a high school graduate-student nurse ? This shortage of nurses is of vital concern to the public and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more attractive . H. S. M. Roselle , N. J. , Aug. 26 , 1946 . Why People Like New York To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Topics of The Times has recently referred to Stanley Walker 's regretful pondering over past associations and amenities during twenty-five years of New York residence , his dissatisfaction with present-day conditions and affiliations , and his intention to go away somewhere and sit under a live oak tree . The editor pursues the subject by establishing the fact that the city was much the same quiet or maddening place in by-gone days as it is now , and predicts that Mr. Walker will not be able to do without it . Be that as it may , " Why do people like to live in New York ? " is a question that evokes a variety of answers that extend from Wall Street , past the shops of Fifth Avenue , the Public Library , along the Great White Way and up to the historical societies , the museums and the universities . But , also , there are some unusual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their neighbors because their neighbors mind their own business ; and there is the Old Timer who likes Central Park because from his accustomed bench he greets the oldfashioned one-horse carriages with their calm and venerable high-hat drivers . And , finally , there is the friend who belongs to no church but in whose neighborhood there are five or six " All Welcome " churches , at one or another of which , according to his particular Sunday inclination , he attends service and so regards himself as liberally religious and a true " Freedom-of-Worship " American . ALBERT ULMANN . New York . Aug. 28 , 1946 . History of Churchill Hospital To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Just to keep the record straight . In THE TIMES of Aug. 18 it is stated in part in an AP dispatch " At Oxford , two attempts were made to stake claims in huts surrounding the Church Hill Hospital , an institution built by the American Red Cross and one of the largest in Britain . " The Churchill Hospital was named in honor of Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor and with British materials as part of the scheme of the Emergency Medical Service . The architect was Mr. R. Fielding Dodd , F. R. I. B. A. Ground was broken in December ; 1940 , and in September , 1941 , the Ministry of Health invited the American Hospital in Britain to administer the hospital . On To THE EDITOR OP THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your news columns of Aug. 19 included a story bearing a London dateline quoting the London Sunday Pictorial with reference to the recent lynchings at Monroe , Ga . The editorial in the Pictorial to which the story refers is said to have stated that " America has nerve " to attack British action in India and Palestine and after quoting from the United States Constitution and Declaration of Independence the editorial stated that the Georgia incident " may well make arguable the competence of the United States to offer tuition in democracy to other nations . " I think it might well be brought to the attention of the editors of the London Sunday Pictorial , as well as to others who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incidents as the Georgia lynchings , the difference between British action in India and Palestine and incidents such as occurred in Georgia . The obvious difference between the two is that the British action in India and Palestine is the policy of the British Government formulated after debate in the House of Commons and carried out by the British Government itself , presumably with the approval of the majority of the British people . The unfortunate Georgia incident and other similar incidents are violations of our laws and our concept of justice . These thing " ohock the conscience of every decent eiLiten , and such crimes are perpetratol as are most crimes , by a small handful of lawless people the like of which exist even in England as well as all other civilized countries . These incidents are perpetrated by lawbreakers and are not the result of settled and deliberate policies either of the United Stakes or of the State of Georgia . There is clqarly great need for mutual understanding among all English-speaking peoples , and particularly between Great Britain and the United States , and I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts to bring about the rule of reason in tho world . KENNETH H. GUILD . New Ye rk , Aug. 27 , 1946 . Peualtiss for Hoax Pernetrators To THA EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : It was satisfying to read of the high fines imposed upon those risking the lives of others through false fire alarms turned in for selfish personal amusement . Are not persons perpetrating what they term a hoax in the same class as those who turn in false fire alarms ? , Why are these people allowed to go free while law abiding citizens pay in taxes for their bursts of destructive temperament ? Why are they not forced to pay for the dragging of lakes , hiring of blood hounds , telegrams , the valuable time of police and citizens needed for constructive work ? There would be fewer and fewer disgraceful acts of this sort if participants , not the taxpayers , were forced to pay for every " false alarm , " even if disguised under the name of hoax .

Policy Versus A Violations British Statement on Lawbreaking Here Held Irresponsible Allowance for All Enlisted Men To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : , I am a veteran , and just the other day I sent in my application for terminal leave pay . According to the Armed Forces Leave Act of 1946 only those enlisted men serving in the first three grades or ratings at the time last separated who had dependents are entitled to receive an additional allowance of $1.25 a day for quarters . This provision in the law discriminates against those of us who served either as privates , privates first-class , or as corporals .
