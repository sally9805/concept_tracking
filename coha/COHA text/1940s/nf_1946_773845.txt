txt // organism are activated by enzymes , and these bodies therefore assume a very great importance in metabolism . They are most familiar and have been most intensively studied , however , in connection with the process of digestion . A digestive process is almost always one of hydrolysis , where the material is made to take up water and is then broken down . The basic chemical change in the digestion of starch into a simple sugar is thus as follows : Fats , in a similar way , are broken down into fatty acids and glycerine , and proteins into their constituent amino acids . These changes are all activated by enzymes , but they are specific in character , and each type of digestion requires the activity of a different type of enzyme . Enzymes may therefore be classified according to the type of food which they digest . Among those breaking down carbohydrates is sucrase , or invertase , which digests sucrose to glucose and fructose , thus : Diastase , the first enzyme to be investigated , was identified more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : This process consists of a number of steps and probably involves a number of different enzymes . Maltose , in turn , is usually broken down almost immediately by maltase to glucose , thus : The celluloses are digested by a series of enzymes known as cellulases , or cytases , which are secreted by the cells of wooddestroying fungi and some other plants and are ordinarily rather slow in their action . Enzymes which digest fats are known as lipases . These ar . all very similar in their action , but those from different , planik // often show minor but constant differences which prove that they are not exactly identical . Proteins are digested by proteases of various types . Pepsin hydrolyzes proteins to intermediate products , the proteoses , or peptones ; and trypsin carries the process further with the ultimate production of amino acids . These various enzymes are ordinarily produced within plant cells , and it is there that the reserve food is stored and digestion takes place . In insectivorous plants and fungi , however , enzymes are secreted by the plant and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorbs the products of digestion . Assimilation. ? After a food has been digested , it must then enter the protoplasm of a cell and become an integral part of . the living substance . This process is known as assimilation and is the central problem of metabolism . From the activities of protoplasm it is clear that this remarkable material must be very complex , both chemically and physically . It is highly unstable and is continually undergoing processes of construction and destruction . Although one can trace with some confidence the entrance into protoplasm of certain comparatively simple substances and the departure therefrom of others equally simple , little is known as to the happenings which take place between these two events . It is here that dead matter becomes alive and that inert food substances become endowed with the unique properties of living protoplasm . This change never occurs spontaneously in nature but is always brought about through the activity of protoplasm already existing , all the evidence at hand indicating that life always comes from life and in no other way . Although this process is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has as yet been unable to master its intricacies or to bring it to pass in the laboratory . Respiration. ? Those physiological changes which involve the progressive elaboration of organic substance reach their climax in the production of protoplasm . This constant upbuilding and renewal of the living material is succeeded by an equally constant process of disintegration , which results in the liberation of energy and which usually is accompanied by the intake of oxygen and the outgo of carbon dioxide . This general process is termed respiration . Before entering upon a detailed study of this important phase // of plant physiology one should understand clearly the phenomena involved in the energy relations of the plant , to which not only the process of respiration but also those of food synthesis and nutrition essentially belong . Like every other living thing , the plant is continually active . This activity shows itself in movement of various sorts : of the plant body as a whole , of the substances within it , of atoms and molecules during those chemical changes which are always taking place in living cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These various movements , the maintenance of which is necessary if the plant is to remain alive , require the expenditure of energy , as do all movements of matter ; and one of the chief problems in the economy of the plant , as in the operation of any machine , is to obtain an adequate supply of energy and to liberate it at the proper times and in the proper places . Kinetic and Potential Energy. ? Energy exists in the universe in two forms : active , or kinetic , and stored , or potential , energy . Kinetic energy performs work by setting matter in motion , by changing its position , by raising its temperature , by producing chemical alterations within it , or in other ways . Potential energy is inactive energy , stored up in an object by virtue of the position or condition of that object . Potential energy exists in a stretched spring , in a bent bow , in the water of a mountain stream , in a charged battery , in a piece of coal , or in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result of the previous expenditure of kinetic energy upon that object . Care should of course be taken not to confuse this " storage " of energy with the storage of food or any other form of matter . The presence or absence of a supply of stored energy in a given body merely affects the relations between its parts and does not alter in the least the bulk of the object or the amount of matter which it contains . One needs to remember only that a bent spring weighs no more than an unbent one or a charged battery than an uncharged one . Energy and matter , at least in ordinary experience , are fundamentally distinct . Release of Stored Energy. ? The potential energy in an object , may at any time , under an appropriate stimulus , become converted again into kinetic form and do work , as when the compressed spring moves the mechanism of a watch , the bow moves an arrow , the falling water moves a mill wheel , the battery moves // a telegraph sounder , the burning coal converts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explosive moves a projectile . In all of these cases , if long enough continued , the supply of stored energy is finally exhausted , and motion ceases . In this process of converting potential into kinetic energy or the reverse , no energy is gained or lost , the total amount remaining constant . A machine is anything which controls and directs the liberation of energy so that work of a particular kind is done at a particular place and time . One of its prime necessities is an ample supply of potential energy , and in the machines which are most familiar this is available in the form of wood , coal , oil , or stored electricity . The living organism resembles a machine in the fact that it , too , directs the expenditure of energy , and it therefore needs a plentiful supply of this energy in potential form which it may liberate , in the process of respiration , at any point throughout its body for the performance of its many activities . The fuel which the organic machine uses in this process is known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came originally from the kinetic energy of sunlight and was converted into potential form by photosynthesis in the green cells of the leaf . Food resembles wood , coal , or oil in being a somewhat unstable chemical compound which , through the addition of oxygen , will break down and resolve itself into simpler components , ultimately carbon dioxide and water , and by this means release the potential energy that it contains . This process of oxidation is common in nature . In ordinary fuels it takes place only at high temperatures and is then known as combustion . In living organisms it can go on at much lower temperatures and here is known as physiological combustion , or respiration . In their essential feature ? the liberation of energy in kinetic form by the breaking down of complex and unstable chemical compounds into simpler ones through the addition of oxygen ? respiration and combustion are essentially similar . A machine is supplied with fuel ( its " food " ) by an operator , and an animal obtains its food by seizure , but the food which a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own activities . The significance of the food-making process called photosynthesis is now more evident than before . The kinetic energy which the plant , through its chlorophyll , absorbs directly from the light of the sun is here used to do the work of breaking // up carbon dioxide and water and reuniting these atoms into the simple food glucose . The energy expended in accomplishing this union is obviously stored up in potential form in the molecules of glucose and of the other foods or plant materials which may be derived therefrom , just as the energy expended in winding a clock is stored up in the compressed mainspring . Under appropriate conditions this potential energy may be liberated anywhere and at any time to do work in any organism . One of the most important principles of physiology is thus made evident ? that food is merely the medium by which energy received from the sun intermittently and only in certain exposed organs is stored up , carried to all parts of the plant ( or animal ) , and made available for work at all times and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the metaphor that " food is a storage battery , ' charged in green leaves by the sun and discharged in the body by respiration . " Relatively little energy is liberated by plants in comparison to animals , since the latter are much more active . A man , for example , requires about 2500 calories of energy per day , far more than an equal weight of plant material will liberate . In a gallon of gasoline there are about 26,000 calories , enough to last a man ten days but a plant of the same size much longer . With an understanding of the significance of the plant 's energy relationships and the part which respiration plays therein , a more detailed study of respiration itself may be undertaken . This process , unlike photosynthesis , is not carried on in particular organs and under particular conditions but is universal , taking place under all conditions and in every living cell . Respiration , indeed , is believed to be a necessary accompaniment of life itself , as might be inferred from the fact that living protoplasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even in cells which show no other external signs of life , respiration , though very feeble , may still be detected . The amount of respiration which takes place is a rough index of the activity of the cell , organ , or organism studied , being relatively high in active tissues and relatively low in dormant ones . Aerobic Respiration. ? Most respiration in plants , as in animals , requires the presence of free oxygen , usually available from the abundant supply in the atmosphere . Much abbreviated , its chemical reaction may be written thus : This reaction , however , presents an oversimplified picture of the process of respiration . Much more is involved than when sugar is burned in a furnace and broken down at once into carbon dioxide and water . In protoplasm this ultimate result is accomplished in a far more intricate fashion through a chain of successive reactions each controlled by an enzyme or enzyme system . Of the enzymes involved some of the most important are the zymases , which break down simple sugars to carbon dioxide and alcohol ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the addition of free oxygen , first by forming hydrogen peroxide and then by transferring the oxygen from the peroxide to the organic compound ; the catalases , which break down hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen ; and the hydrogenases , which pass hydrogen along from one substance to another until it unites with free oxygen to form water . Inter-mediate products of various kinds may be found and the whole process is a very complex one . The series of reactions may be different in different plants and in the same plant under different conditions . The materials from which energy is liberated in aerobic respira tion are chiefly the simple carbohydrates , and to such forms most other foods are converted if they are to enter the respiratory process . Proteins , though their chief function is constructive , undoubtedly also contribute to the supply of oxidizable sub-stances . Whatever nitrogenous waste material is given off in their disintegration , however , must immediately be assimilated again , for ( at least among the higher plants ) nitrogenous com pounds do not appear among the products of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all respiration . Indeed , the evolution of this gas , even in minute amounts , is regarded as proof that the organism is respiring and therefore alive . The amount of oxygen taken in and the amount of carbon dioxide given off are in the long run equal though under certain conditions one may temporarily exceed the other . Much of the energy liberated in the process of respiration is in the form of heat , and a respiring organism therefore tends // to raise the temperature of its environment . In plants , however , this becomes dissipated so quickly that it does not produce a " body temperature " as in the higher animals . Besides heat , however , other forms of kinetic energy may be liberated such as chemical energy , mechanical energy , electrical energy , and even light . These are concerned with the great variety of movements and chemical changes which take place in the plant body , in somewhat the same way that the energy liberated from burning coal in a factory boiler may not only run the machinery , but provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By comparing the chemical equations for photosynthesis and aerobic respiration , it will be seen that one is the precise reverse or reciprocal of the other . Photosynthesis adds carbon dioxide to water and produces sugar and oxygen . Respiration adds oxygen to sugar and produces carbon dioxide and water . These two processes actually may be going on in the same tissue at the same time , a circumstance which has made the study of plant metabolism peculiarly difficult , since one activity may mask the other . Photosynthesis , however , is confined to the chlorophyll-bearing cells and occurs in them only in the presence of light . In such cells there is a preponderance of photosynthesis in the daytime and of respiration at night . For a brief period in the morning and again in the evening , and for longer times when illumination is low or other conditions unfavorable for photosynthesis , the two processes may balance each other exactly , the tissues giving off in photosynthesis just the amount of oxygen which is necessary to carry on their respiratory activity . Respiration , unlike photosynthesis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aerobic Respiration. ? A brief comparison between photosynthesis and respiration is presented in tabular form below : // In its essential characteristics ? intake of oxygen , liberation of energy , and raising of temperature the aerobic respiration of plants is exactly comparable to the respiration of animals , a fact which the complexities of plant metabolism sometimes obscure . Those pioneers in the study of photosynthesis , Ingen-Iiousz and de Saussure , also made the first steps toward our modern understanding of respiration . The former in his studies on the purification of air found in 1774 that fruits , flowers , and other nongreen plant structures rendered " impure " the air around them , just as did animals , and that green plants in the dark produced the same result . De Saussure in 1804 showed that under proper conditions plants absorb oxygen and given off carbon dioxide and water and that this respiratory activity is the same in plants and animals and is important in their growth and other activities . Anaerobic Respiration ( Fermentation ) . ? Anaerobic respiration , in which the breaking down of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompanied by an intake of free oxygen , is characteristic of certain lower plants and sometimes of higher ones when temporarily deprived of oxygen . The best known examples of this process are alcoholic fermentations and allied phenomena . These were named " fermentations " from the fact that the activity of ferments ( now more commonly called enzymes ) was here first clearly shown . There is consequently a confusion in the application of the term fermentation , the commonest usage regarding it as practically synonymous with anaerobic respiration , the other expanding it to cover all activity brought about by the agency of enzymes . The most important characteristic of anaerobic respiration is the fact that it does not lead to a complete breaking down of the organic substance or food but only to its partial decomposition , with the result that a quantity of more or less complex by-products are necessarily formed which still contain a considerable amount of potential energy . The accumulation of these by-products often stops the process itself . The first steps in both aerobic and anaerobic respiration are probably similar , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken down into carbon dioxide and water . // The fermentation of sugar by yeast is the classic example of anaerobic respiration . The yeast plants ? minute , single-celled organisms ? thrive in rather weak solutions of sugar . Those which have easy access to the air usually respire aerobically , but if the supply of free oxygen is limited ( as is the case anywhere below the surface of the liquid ) or if it becomes exhausted , the yeast respires anaerobically . The cells now obtain their energy through a partial decomposition of the sugar , with the formation of carbon dioxide and a complex by-product , ethyl alcohol , thus : It is evident that only a portion of the potentiaf energy in the sugar has been liberated , for the resulting alcohol may be absorbed by another organism or may be burned and will then yield a considerable amount of additional energy . When the concentration of alcohol has reached a certain point , it poisons the yeast plant , and fermentation ceases . The respiration of other minute plants may also bring about alcoholic fermentation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as those having for their by-products butyric acid ( in the spoiling of butter ) , lactic acid ( in the souring of milk ) , and various others , many of which are of economic importance . In all these cases energy is liberated and may be detected by the consequent rise in temperature , which is often more marked than in aerobic respiration . Certain microorganisms are exclusively ' anaerobic and are actually killed by the presence of free oxygen . Others , like yeast , may respire either aerobically or anaerobically , depending upon the external conditions . The decay of dead organic matter is due almost entirely to the respiration of microorganisms . If the material is exposed freely to the air , bacteria will break it down rapidly and completely by their aerobic respiration . If free oxygen is unavailable , as is the case within a large mass of dead organic material , the process is carried on anaerobically and is slower and more complicated . Here a whole series of microorganisms , each specific in its activity , are successively concerned . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a // certain amount of the potential energy which it contains . In its altered chemical state and with its diminished supply of energy , the remaining material is now seized upon by another type of microorganism and , entering into the anaerobic respiration of this form , is broken down still further and loses still more of its potential energy . This process continues until finally the whole of the material ( except its mineral constituents ) passes into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide , water , and nitrogen , the original materials out of which organic substance is constructed . Roles of the Essential Elements in Metabolism. ? In the production and successful functioning of protoplasm , the four elements thus far emphasized ? carbon , hydrogen , oxygen , and nitrogen ? are of basic importance , but there are a number of others which are vitally necessary , though in small amounts , and which thus have an essential place in plant metabolism . Chief among these are sulphur , phosphorus , calcium , magnesium , potassium , and iron ( Fig. 107 ) . The part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few cases is it at all completely understood . // Phosphorus enters into the composition of the nucleic acids , which are known to be important in certain activities of protoplasm , especially in cell division and other processes associated with the chromosomes . Sulphur is a constituent of many proteins . It apparently stimulates the development of the root system and is important in the production of chlorophyll . Calcium is essential in some way in the translocation of food within the plant and in the development of the middle lamella . It is also useful in regulating acidity and reducing the toxic effect of various single elements by the formation of balanced nutrient solutions . Magnesium is a constituent of chlorophyll . Potassium in some unknown manner plays a vital part in photosynthesis and also appears to be necessary in mitosis . Iron is present only in minute quantities but is essential in the production of chlorophyll , and plants grown in its absence become pale and soon die . Strangely enough , however , iron does not enter into the composition of the chlorophyll molecule . In addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be necessary for plant growth . Among these are zinc , silicon , chlorine , boron , and manganese , and there are probably others . These are effective in extremely minute quantities . Thus the difference between a nutrient solution which has no zinc in it and one which contains only one part in 200,000,000 can be detected by the improved growth of certain plants in the latter . These elements may serve as enzymes or as accessory food materials , but their role in most cases is still very obscure . The demonstration of the physiological importance of so many chemical elements further emphasizes the extreme complexity of plant metabolism . Vitamins and Plant Metabolism. ? Vitamins have for some time been recognized as essential factors in the nutrition and metabolic activities of animals , but it is only recently that botanists have discovered that these remarkable substances are also necessary for the life of plants . Furthermore , most of the vitamins are now known to be synthesized by plants , and thus assume added importance in plant physiology . Vitamins belong to that group of substances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements ( such as zinc and boron ) , and certain other materials belong , which are essential // 1 ingly small amounts . The growth of a strain of yeast plants , for example , has been shown to be doubled by the addition to the culture medium in which they are growing of only one part in 50 billion of the vitamin biotin . The vitamins are classified roughly into groups according to certain chemical and physiological characteristics . Vitamin A , which is fat-soluble , is essential for animal growth and especially for healthy vision . It is closely related to the yellow pigment carotene , always associated with chlorophyll , and is produced only by green plants . The role of these pigments , and thus of vitamin A , in plant physiology is not well understood . The B group of vitamins , which are water-soluble , are also synthesized only by plants , though not necessarily by green ones . Thiamin ( vitamin BI ) , riboflavin ( B2 ) , pyridoxin ( B6 ) , nicotinic acid , and biotin are all members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part in animal physiology . Thus a deficiency of thiamin produces characteristic nervous effects ; that of riboflavin , certain skin and eye disorders , and of nicotinic acid , the disease known as pellagra . These B vitamins have also been found to be necessary for the life of plants of all sorts , from bacteria and yeasts to angiosperms , and are , therefore , particularly important in a study of plant metabolism . Vitamin C , or ascorbic acid , is well known as the preventative of scurvy . It also is synthesized by plants and has been shown to be essential for plant growth . Exactly why these vitamins are necessary in plant metabolism is not well known , but the role played by some of them is beginning to be understood . Thiamin , for example , is identical with cocarboxylase , a portion of the enzyme carboxylase which controls one of the complex chains of reactions in respiration . Riboflavin and nicotinic acid also are concerned in some way with other parts of the respiratory process . Important information as to where and how vitamins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has come in recent years from studies in the physiology of plants of all sorts , but particularly of the fungi . Plants differ markedly in their synthetic abilities . Thus one of the simple molds , a species of the genus Phycomyces , will not grow even if all the ordinary essential substances are placed in its nutrient solution unless thiamin is also added . Evidently this fungus can not synthesize thiamin , // but resembles an animal in requiring a supply of it from outside sources . A molecule of thiamin consists of two simpler molecules , one of thiazole and one of pyrimidine ; and this mold will grow well if given these two substances . It therefore can synthesize thiamin from these two components , but can not make either of them from simpler substances . Some plants can synthesize thiazole but not pyrimidine , as is shown by their ability to grow when supplied only with pyrimidine . Others form pyrimidine , but not thiazole . Still others can do neither , but require the complete thiamin molecule if they are to grow at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two major components was perhaps to be expected among fungi , which are different in many aspects of their metabolism from the higher plants . but it might be supposed that the living // material of green plants would always be able to make this essential substance . Pieces of tomato roots cultured with sugar and the essential mineral salts will grow indefinitely only if a small amount of thiamin is also available . Evidently the root in this species requires the vitamin just as does an animal , and obtains it by transfer from the stem and leaves , where it is synthesized . Thus the root is dependent on the shoot for both carbohydrates and thiamin . Most green plants seem able to produce all of this vitamin which they need , and only under exceptional conditions , when their own synthesis is low , will additions from without prove effective . A comparison of the root growth of various species of green plants in tissue culture shows that among these , too , there is much diversity of requirements not only for thiamin but for other members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of flax roots , thiamin seems to be necessary ; for peas , radishes , clover , alfalfa , and cotton , thiamin and nicotinic acid are required ; for carrots , thiamin and pyridoxin ; for tomatoes , Jimson weed , and sunflowers , thiamin , nicotinic acid , and // pyridoxin . There is some difference of opinion among various workers as to the requirements of particular plants , but there is agreement on the general fact of diversity . The inability of certain plants to synthesize a particular vitamin makes possible the measurement of very small quantities of it . Races of yeast in which such deficiencies have been found are particularly useful ( Fig. 108 ) . A certain yeast , for example , is unable to make pyridoxin , and even if all the materials ordinarily required are added to the nutrient solution , its cells will not grow and multiply unless a little of this vitamin is added . The amount of its growth in a given time , as measured by the increasing cloudiness of the culture solution , is proportional to the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lacking pyridoxin , a given amount of material to be tested ? let us say some food ? is added , the amount of growth shown by the yeast culture can be used as a measure of the amount of this particular vitamin in the food . By this method very rapid and // accurate assays of all sorts of food materials may now be made for the B group of vitamins . The study of vitamin metabolism in plants has proved to be of importance not only for problems of nutrition but because of the information which it has yielded as to some of the basic activities of protoplasm , notably those concerned with respira tion . The fact that certain of the vitamins perform the same essential functions in the metabolism of both animals and plants furnishes another example of the fundamental similarity in the physiological processes of all living things . In metabolic problems the recently developed techniques for the culture of organs and tissues of the higher plants are very useful . Bits of roots ( Fig. 109 ) will grow indefinitely in sterile cultures if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and essential vitamins ) . Bits of callus and similar unorganized tissues can also be grown in this way ( Fig. 110 ) . By modifying the nutrient medium , the metabolic requirements , as to mineral salts , vitamins , and other substances , of such parts can be determined . CHAPTER VIII GROWTH A large part of the food which a plant manufactures is used as a source of energy , and as the potential energy it contains is liberated in kinetic form through the process of respiration , the food breaks down again into those simple components out of which it was constructed . Food may be thus consumed soon after it is produced , or it may be stored and used as a source of energy for the plant or its offspring weeks , months , or even years later . A healthy plant , however , manufactures more food than is necessary to maintain the activities of its living substance , and the surplus may be built , more or less permanently , into its tissues , producing new protoplasm and new cell walls and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represents the excess of constructive over destructive metabolism . A knowledge of what it involves and of how it takes place is evidently necessary if one is to arrive at a clear understanding of the structure and the development of plants . The term " growth " is difficult to define exactly . In its simplest usage it refers to any increase in size , either of the whole organism or of its parts . The basic process in growth is the production of new protoplasm . This is especially evident in regions of active cell division . Most of the visible increase in plant size , however , is the result of absorption of water and the consequent stretching of the tissues , a process which in the strict sense is not growth at all , since it involves little or no increase in the characteristic material of the plant itself . This is followed by a third stage in which an abundance of building materials , chiefly carbohydrates , enters these expanded young tissues and markedly increases their dry weight but results in no increase in visible , external @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one sense but not in another . The entire process has a simple ultimate result ? a permanent increase in the size of the plant and all its constituents ? and the difficulties in 221 // definition come from the fact that the various aspects of growth do not take place simultaneously but successively . In studying this process of growth in the plant as a whole it should be remembered that the plant body is made up of a mass of minute cells . The size of the cells in any particular tissue and within the same species is rather constant and is believed to approximate the most efficient size for that particular tissue . Very large cells and very small ones evidently would possess many disadvantages . It is therefore clear that growth must consist in the production of more cells rather than in the enlargement of those already present ; and the formation of new cells by the plant is therefore the most essential feature of the growth process . The Formation of New Cells. ? In the previous discussion of the plant cell ( Chapter III ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of protoplasm in which two portions may be distinguished : the relatively undifferentiated ground mass , or cytoplasm , and a denser and more or less spherical body within this , the nucleus . About the whole is a cellulose wall deposited by the protoplasm . In growing tissues where cell multiplication is proceeding , this wall is very thin , and the single vacuole , so conspicuous in mature cells , is ordinarily represented by a large number of much smaller ones . In the formation of new cells at such growing regions , and the development therefrom of new tissues , three stages may be distinguished corresponding to the three stages of growth outlined above : cell division , in which the number of cells is increased by the repeated division of certain of them into two ; cell enlargement , in which these new cells expand rapidly to their final size ; and cell differentiation , in which they assume their mature structure and characteristics ( Fig. 120 ) . Cell Division. ? Cell division is not the simple splitting of a cell into two parts but is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinarily much smaller than those of the mature tissues to which they give rise and are very uniform in structure . The nucleus , here relatively large in proportion to the rest of the cell , is the structure which takes the most active part in division , for before the entire cell divides into two the nucleus itself does so by a characteristic process known as mitosis ( Figs. 111 to 113 ) . This can not well be studied in living tissue , and a knowledge of it has been derived from microscopic // examination of thin sections which have been carefully prepared and stained . Within the nucleus of any cell which is not undergoing division and which in respect to this process is said to be in a " resting , " or metabolic , condition , there is a network , often very fine and hard to distinguish as such , consisting chiefly of a substance which stains very deeply with certain dyes used in the study of cell structures and which hence has received the name of chro matin . When a cell is preparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AND PROBLEMS tion of this nuclear net into a series of definite bodies , usually rod-shaped or elongate , the chromosomes . This stage in nuclear division is known technically as the prophase . For any given species the number and character of chromosomes in the cell is characteristic and constant ( Fig. 114 ) . Thus , in the body cells of the lily there are always twenty-four ; in those of the onion , sixteen ; and in those of the pea , fourteen . Furthermore , each chromosome is not merely an undifferentiated mass of chromatin but has its own persistent individuality in size and shape which is repeated at every cell division and which can often be recog nized by the skilled observer ( Fig. 115 ) . Each chromosome now splits exactly into two , its halves still lying side by side . At about this time two poles or apparent centers of attraction arise in the cytoplasm on opposite sides of the nucleus , and from each of these poles a mass of delicate fibers radiates inward // to the nucleus . The nuclear membrane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some of them becoming attached to the chromosomes and others extending continuously from one pole to the other , the entire fiber system being known as the spindle . The chromosome pairs now move into a plane // or equatorial plate stretching across the cell at right angles to the spindle , the attainment of this stage marking the metaphase of division . Each chromosome has a spindle fiber attached to it , sometimes at the end , sometimes near the middle , at a specialized point known as the kinetocore . For the two members of a pair ( the two halves of each of the original chromosomes ) the fibers run to opposite poles . The contraction of the spindle fibers which now takes place seems to pull these halves apart , one group of chromosomes moving toward one pole and an entirely similar group moving toward the other , a stage designated as the anaphase . Each chromosome group now becomes aggregated into a tangled mass from which a new chromatin net develops and around which a nuclear membrane makes its appearance . Meanwhile a new cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually through the appearance of minute thickenings at the middle points of the fibers which still connect the nuclei , and the union of these thickenings into a continuous cell plate which ultimately extends entirely across the cell . This stage , the telophase , is followed by the splitting of the cell plate into two layers and the deposition between them of a new cell wall , which completes the divi sion of the mother cell into two similar daughter cells . This com plicated process is apparently concerned with the accomplishment of an exactly equal division of the chromatin material between the two daughter cells and thus among all the cells of the plant body , suggesting the conclusion , which receives support from a large body of other evidence , that the chromatin is of the utmost importance in directing the growth and differentiation of the organism . As division progresses the original cell increases somewhat in size , so that by the time the two daughter cells are formed , or shortly thereafter , each is as large as the original mother cell . This increase is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell , and it is here that new protoplasm is being produced most rapidly from its various constituents . Regions of cell // division are those of active synthesis of protoplasm , though the stages in this process are still very obscure . Cell division is most commonly studied in those regions where the cells are small and almost filled with cytoplasm , as at the tips of the growing points of root and stem . Many cells continue to divide , however , long after they have expanded considerably and have developed a large central vacuole . Between divisions in such cases , the nucleus is somewhat flattened against the cell wall in the thin layer of the cytoplasm . During early prophase it rounds up and is suspended in the vacuole by cytoplasmic strands . These strands soon aggregate into a more or less continuous . plate , the phragmosome ( Fig. 116 ) , which occupies the position of the future partition wall . The nucleus goes through the various stages of mitosis thus held in a central position . After telophase a cell plate develops between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old cell wall , following the position of the phragmosome and being laid down by an expanding circle of kinoplasmic fibrils . In this way relatively large and highly vacuolated cells divide in meristematic regions . After wounding or under other abnormal conditions large mature cells often follow the same method of division . Cell Enlargement. ? The two new cells formed by a division may each divide again , as may their daughter cells and those of successive divisions , with the result that in a few cell generations the number of cells increases very greatly . This process of cell multiplication is especially evident in actively growing struc tures . Ultimately , however , division ceases and the cells begin // to assume their mature characteristics . In most tissues the first step in this change is a very considerable increase in size . This results in part from an increase in bulk of the nucleus and cytoplasm , but chiefly from the development of vacuoles in the cell , which finally unite to form a single large one , the sap cavity , that fills almost the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layer next to the wall . This great increase in cell volume by vacuolation after division has ceased is one of the chief ways in which plant cells typically differ from those of animals . Cell enlargement is not limited to the period after division ceases but may begin considerably earlier so that even in a structure where cell multiplication is actively going on , the average cell size is increasing . This simply means that a daughter cell , before it again divides , reaches a size greater than its mother cell did , so that the members of each cell generation are somewhat larger than those of the previous one . This is commonly the case in the development of organs of limited growth , such as leaves and fruits . In sharply localized meristems , such as the terminal ones of root and stem , the cells at the tip usually maintain a rather constant size while those further back progressively increase as they still divide . Since cell division cuts the size of a cell in two , cell size in a region where division is occurring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of expansion . Where the former process is relatively rapid , average cell size may actually decrease for a time . Most of the cell enlargement , however , occurs after division has ceased . Its extent depends on the tissue concerned . Sometimes , especially in physiologically active cells , it is not great . In storage parenchyma , such as the pulp cells of some fruits , it may result in an increase of several thousandfold ( Fig. 117 ) . Enlargement may be the same in all directions , resulting in cells which approach a sphere in shape ; but often it is markedly unequal in different dimensions so that some cells become long and narrow or assume a great variety of other shapes . In general the cells of a given tissue will tend to reach a rather definite size at maturity which is presumably related to the physiological activity of the cells . This size may vary considerably , however , as a result of pressure , amount of available water , change in chromosome number , and other factors . Mr- // ferences in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between one part of the plant and another , or between two plants , may be due to differences in the number or in the size of the cells composing them , or to both , but cell number is usually the more important factor . An oak is larger than a violet chiefly because of the much greater number of cells which make up its body . Cell Differentiation. ? Enlargement is only one of the changes which occur in a cell as it becomes mature . The new tissues which are formed of thin-walled and rapidly growing cells are soft and weak . The third stage in growth , cell differentiation , is brought about by the transfer of an abundant supply of food into these newly formed parts and the consequent construction therefrom of additional materials , chiefly in the cell wall , until the cells have reached their normal mature condition . The changes which a cell undergoes at this stage depend upon the type of tissue to which it is destined to belong . Sieve tubes , pith cells , and fibers will obviously differ greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although cell size and form become established in the previous stage of growth , the most distinctive differences do not appear until enlargement has ceased . The stages of enlargement and differentiation are accompanied by a marked increase in the carbohydrates , especially in the // cell wall , in contrast to the first stage , where the increase is chiefly in protoplasm itself . In cell division and differentiation , there is little growth in volume but considerable in dry weight ; in cell enlargement , there is much growth in volume but little in dry weight . Unlocalized Growth. ? Such , in brief , is the history of the production of new cells by which the growth of the plant body takes place . In those organs of the plant like the leaf , flower , and fruit , which are determinate in their growth , reaching a final size beyond which no further in-crease takes place , cell division usually goes on throughout the entire young organ just as it does in growing animal tissue . Cell enlargement and differentiation fol low and are also widespread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the organ are expanding at the same time , is often termed interstitial . In many struc tures the three phases of growth do not proceed exactly together . Cell division commonly ceases earlier in fundamental than in epidermal tissue , for example , so that cell size is much greater in the former than in the latter . Thus , the pulp cells of a watermelon cease dividing when the young fruit is rather small and expand to relatively enormous size as the fruit grows , while the cells of the outer cortex and epidermis continue to divide almost as long as the fruit grows , never becoming very large . Interstitial growth often pro-ceeds at somewhat different rates at different points , so that the organ changes somewhat in form as it expands . This may best be shown in such a simple organ as a leaf , where the relative intensity of growth in various parts may be shown by cross-lining a young leaf and comparing the subsequent growth of squares located in different parts of the blade ( Fig. 118 ) . // Differential growth may produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended , as may be demonstrated by making an incision through the tissues and observing their size changes when the tension is thus removed . Organs which increase by interstitial growth are usually of limited duration , for all their cells become differentiated , none remaining embryonic . The continual repair of essentially permanent tissue by the production of new cells , such as occurs in animals , rarely takes place . Growing Points and Their Function. ? The axial organs ? root and stem ? which in larger plants constitute the bulk of the plant body , are indeterminate in growth and can continue to increase in size almost indefinitely . Most of the tissues of these organs are necessarily mature and functioning ; and since their cells are surrounded by dead , firm , and usually thick walls , cell division within them is difficult or impossible . Such tissues are really locked within their own walls and can grow no farther . The continual production of new cells in organs of this sort is accomplished through the activity of growing points , or meristems , which are merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thin-walled and- packed with protoplasm . These groups of permanently " young " cells occupy regions where growth is to take place , as at the tip of the root or stem or at the cambium . Such a growing point may long remain dormant , but when it becomes active , cell division begins again within it . The newly formed cells which lie next to the already mature tissue now undergo enlargement and become themselves mature . This process does not affect all of the cells of the growing point , however , for the portion away from the maturing cells still remains undifferentiated and continues to serve as a center of production for young cells which are to be added to the tissue . The growing point is thus a rather small and inconspicuous group of cells , not increasing in bulk itself but carried progressively outward on the crest of the tissue which it creates . It may perhaps be compared with a layer of coral animals , which by their activity build a reef farther and farther outward and are carried out upon it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a wall and being carried up himself by the wall which he has made . This method of growth at a definite point or layer through the // activity of a meristem , which is so characteristic of plant tissues and so different from that employed in the growth of animals , has certain consequences worthy of mention . It writes in the body an almost complete history of the plant 's growth and development , for many of the first-formed tissues are still present ( unless lost through decay ) , buried in the successively later accretions which have been steadily added . A careful internal and external examination of a tree trunk , for example , would enable one to tell almost exactly how tall and how thick the tree was at any year in its past history . An understanding of the location and activity of growing points is essential in the practice of the various methods of grafting and budding , for these are necessarily concerned with a manipulation of the meristematic regions , // There is no theoretical reason why the growth of a woody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the annual rings of the California redwood ( Fig. 119 ) shows that members of this species live to be at least two thousand years old . The life span of most trees is very much less than this , however , owing to mechanical difficulties , disease , or other causes . It is doubtful whether true " old age , " so common among animals , occurs in most plants . There are many more actual or potential growing points in the plant body than ordinarily develop , but under appropriate conditions any of them may begin to grow . Furthermore , certain cells in mature tissues may occasionally become rejuve nated and begin to divide again , as is well shown in the healing of those wounds which occur in regions lacking meristematic tissue . There are two general types of growing points in most plants ? terminal and lateral . The former , which develop at the tips of roots and stems , cause an increase in the length of these organs , and through their activity the stem grows tall and its roots spread farther into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cambium is the characteristic example , forms a ring or sheath of growing tissue encircling the root and stem throughout their entire extent and causing these organs to increase in thickness . Terminal Growing Points. ? The growing tip of a root furnishes a good example of a terminal growing point , and a brief study of this region perhaps will provide a clearer understanding of how such a tissue functions ( Fig. 120 ) . At the very tip of the root is the root cap , a sheath of cells continually being renewed from the growing point within as they are sloughed off by friction , and protecting the delicate root tip as it is forced through the soil . Just back of this is the zone of cell division , a relatively small mass of tissue usually not more than 2 or 3 mm. in length and composed of small , thin-walled , and richly protoplasmic cells which are capable of rapid multiplication . Behind this is the zone of growth or cell enlargement , where division is still going on but where the cells are increasing markedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few millimeters in length ) that growth of the root in length takes place ( Fig. 121 ) ; and it is the force exerted here by cell elongation which drives the root tip through the soil . By hourly observation of small living roots under the microscope it is sometimes possible to trace the direct descendants // of a single cell in the region of division until these reach mature size some distance back from the tip ( Fig. 122 ) . Beyond this region , in turn , is the zone of differentiation , where the cells , now having attained their full size , assume their mature characteristics . Here differentiation begins , the central cells developing into wood and phloem , those farther out into cortex , and the outermost ones into epidermal cells and root hairs . It should be noted that the width of the young root is determined by the width of the meristem and that no lateral growth occurs here at this time . The root grows in thickness through the sub-sequent activity of a cambium farther back along its axis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very different from that found in a stem . A lateral root , instead of arising as an outgrowth from the surface , begins with the development of a group of meristematic cells in the outer layer of the pericycle . This becomes organized as the terminal growing point of the lateral root , which now pushes out through the . cortex of the old root and breaks out at its surface ( Fig. 123 ) . The terminal growing point at the apex of a stem resembles in its essential features that of a root , but it is somewhat more complex in structure ( Fig. 124 ) . Instead of giving rise to a single organ , as in the root , it here produces both a new stem and new leaves and often new floral organs . The stem itself increases in length much as does the root , and the leaves arise along the sides of the meristem as minute wrinkles or surface outgrowths ( hig. 125 ) which become progressively larger until mature size is attained ( Fig. 126 ) . The leaf , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing point of its own , although the parallel-veined leaves of monocotyledonous plants ( like the grasses ) may continue to grow in length for some time t hrough the meristematic activity of the tissue at the very base of the leaf . // A young stem rudiment , including the growing point and the leaf primordia which have been produced by it , is known as a bud . This includes some of all the tissues rather than those from the vascular cylinder alone , as in the root . In herbaceous plants or in those where growth is continuous , these buds are unprotected . Among woody plants in temperate regions , or wherever growth ceases for considerable periods , the delicate growing points are inclosed in bud scales , which prevent a drying out of the young and watery tissues and protect them against mechanical injury . Various types of buds are recog nized , such as terminal , lateral , adventitious , dormant , and others ( p. 1.47 ) . The differentiation of the organs and tissues within the bud often takes place very early . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , the leaves for the next season 's growth are all present , and their arrangement and shape are well established , though the internodes of the stem of course are extremely short . // What a bud shall be ? whether , for instance , it shall contain leaves or flowers ? is determined during the preceding summer , when the bud begins its development . As the bud expands in the spring , these preformed organs merely increase in size . In the elongation of the stem as it develops from a bursting bud the zones are by no means so well marked as in the root , // and their combined length is greater . Most of the cell division is at the extreme stem tip , but some of it takes place over much of the zone of growth , which may here extend a distance of several centimeters . It is a characteristic feature of the stems of certain monocotyledonous plants , such as the grasses , that the basal portion of each internode and leaf remains meristematic for a considerable period after the upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the internodes grow for some time , and the whole stem elongates by this intercalary growth , much like a folding telescope which is being pulled out . Lateral Growing Point , or Cambium. ? The lateral growing point is somewhat more complicated than the terminal one , and its activities are often a little hard to visualize . The best example of such a meristem is the cambium of the fibrovascular cylinder of root and stem , highly developed in all typical woody plants . It has been shown in the previous study of the stem ( and except for the absence of a pith the root is essentially similar ) that the fibrovascular tissues are arranged in a cylinder , with a ring of wood within and a ring of phloem without ( Fig. 71 ) . Between these two rings is a very thin layer of tissue , in its resting period often only one cell in width , which is formed of the same small , thin-walled , and richly protoplasmic cells which are characteristic of terminal growing points . This is the cambium , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole stem , grows progressively stouter . Unlike the one-sided terminal meristems , however , this lateral growing point adds to the tissues on both its sides . When the cambium is active and cell division is taking place , the newly formed cells which lie on the inner edge of the cambium , next the wood , undergo a period of enlargement and differentiation and become the outermost wood cells ; and the new cells which lie on the outer edge of the cambium , next the phloem , similarly develop into the innermost phloem cells ; but a zone of thin-walled embryonic tissue still remains between the two ( Fig. 127 ) . Thus the cambium , never growing itself , continually adds to the thickness of both its adjacent tissues . The cambium cells are very long in proportion to their width , and the formation of new longitudinal walls , when these cells divide , requires that the new wall be formed at considerable distances from the centrally placed nucleus ( Fig. 128 ) . Wall // formation here resembles that described ( p. 227 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried out by the growing root or stem tip , so the cambium ring is carried farther and farther away from the center of the stem by the growing wood ; and the phloem , lying outside the cambium , is also carried out , not alone by this growth of the wood but by the increase in its own thickness which has taken place at its inner edge ( Fig. 129 ) . Cambial activity perhaps may be crudely pictured by comparing it to the growth of a wall of brick ( the wood ) surmounted by a coping of tile ( the phloem ) ; and by assuming that just at the junction between brick and tile a bricklayer ( the cambium ) is able repeatedly to insert bricks and tiles , the wall thus mounting upward and carrying an ever-thickening coping of tile on its top . As a consequence of this method of growth the youngest layers of the wood are the outermost and the youngest layers of the phloem are the innermost ; and the past history of these two tissues , as it is preserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directions . In woody plants , where growth in thickness is considerable and continuous , the phloem , because of its rather delicate texture and the strain which is put upon it , becomes much stretched and crushed in its outer layers . These ulti mately are sloughed off with the bark , whereas the wood , with its much firmer structure , remains unchanged . Well-marked growth rings are developed in the wood so that an inspection of // this tissue as seen in cross section makes it possible to read with much accuracy the age and past history of the plant ( Fig. 130 ) . A study of growth rings in old trees has recently been employed in the solution of such diverse problems as the antiquity of Pueblo Indian dwellings and the length of climatic cycles . A cambium occurs universally in stems and in roots , where continued lateral growth takes place , and extends the full length of both organ systems , merging into the terminal growing points // of the stem on the one hand and of the root on the other and thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cork Cambium or Phellogen. ? Another lateral growing point of importance is the cork cambium which produces the layers of corky bark . This may arise almost anywhere in the cortex or in the old phloem and develops on its outer face a row of corky cells which soon die and constitute the waterproof layer characteristic of bark tissue ( Figs. 74 and 131 ) . A specialized phellogen , the abscission layer , is developed across , the base of the petiole in an old leaf and produces a zone of cells which causes the leaf to fall and at the same time heals the wound produced ( Fig. 132 ) . A cork cambium can be made to appear in many parts of the plant by wounding them , and the development of a layer of cork by this means is the commonest method by which a plant is protected from infection and loss of water as a result of injuries which break its surface . Primary and Secondary Tissues. ? The tissues laid down by a cambium are often rather regular in the arrangement of their cells , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mately the same size . This is due to the fact that each cambium // cell has produced a whole row of wood cells within and phloem cells without and that these cells naturally are arranged in a straight line along the radius of the stem passing through the cambium cell which is their common ancestor ( Fig. 127 ) . Tissues produced by a cambium are known collectively as secondary tissues , and they all display in transverse section this regular arrangement of their cells . Primary tissues are those which arise from a terminal growing point , and in transverse section their cells are likely to be arranged irregularly , the regularity here , however , being conspicuous in longitudinal sections ( Fig. 120 ) . The epidermis , cortex , and pith , and the first-formed wood and phloem , all are primary in their origin . The great bulk of the wood and phloem in woody plants , together with the corky bark , are all secondary . Rates of Growth. ? Growth rarely takes place at a constant rate but varies greatly depending upon external conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aside from the variations in growth rate which are due to the environment , however , there are certain regular changes in rate which may be rather generally observed in the growth of a plant or of any of its organs . The diameter of a growing gourd fruit , for example , was determined by daily caliper measurements beginning when the ovary was very small , nearly a week before flowering , and continuing until final size had been attained and growth ceased , eighteen days later . The data are presented in the accompanying table : This record of increase in fruit size in a gourd is typical of the course of growth in the organ or body of most living things . // It begins rather slowly , grows progressively faster for a time , and then gradually slows down . If the daily measurements of fruit diameter are plotted against time on a graph , as in Fig. 133 , and if their points are connected , an S-shaped or sigmoid curve is produced . Such a curve describes the growth of many plants and animals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character of the organism and the conditions of its environment . Many attempts have been made to analyze the curves in terms of mathematics , chemistry , or physiology , but growth seems to be too complex to yield to any simple explanation . It is noteworthy that in many cases , as in the data here presented , the early course of growth proceeds with constant acceleration , so that the growth in each successive time unit is a constant percentage of the size already attained . Thus the structure grows like money at compound interest where the interest is compounding continuously . Although the actual rate of growth , here in terms of ' millimeters per day , keeps changing , the rate of compound interest ? the true growth rate for this period ? is constant . This can well be shown by plotting the logarithms of the diameters instead of the diameters themselves , since the logarithmic scale is one in which each unit represents an equal percentage increase . When the data are plotted thus , the points fall on a straight line for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percentage rate of increase . // A determination of this rate is therefore of importance in an analysis of early growth . The table shows that each day results in an increase of about 28 per cent over the day before . This is not a true measure , however , for the rate in a growing plant is compounded continuously , not once a day only . The true rate may be determined by using the formula for con-tinuous compound interest , where W. is the size at a given time , t ; Wo is the size at the beginning of the growth period ; r is the compound interest rate , and e is the base of the natural logarithms , 2.718 . This equation can be stated and solved more simply by the use of common logarithms and is then expressed as follows : and thus : In the present case we may find the true growth rate up to the time , approximately August 9 , when constant compoundinterest growth ceased . Wo is 2.4 mm. ( its logarithm is 0.3802 ) ; W. is 30.0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 ( days ) , and the logarithm of 2.718 is 0.4343 . Thus Twenty-five per cent , continuously compounded , is therefore the true daily rate at which this fruit is growing during the period of compound-interest growth . Why an organism should grow this way is perhaps because early growth is by cell multiplication , itself an accelerative process ; or simply because the amount of new material synthesized by a mass of protoplasm will naturally tend to be proportional to the size of the synthetic mass . Why this constant acceleration should stop and the rate of growth gradually fall off to zero is another problem . Exhaustion of the food supply can not account for this since it will occur when food is abundant . The gradual exhaustion of some essential growth substance is perhaps responsible . The whole growth process is a complex // one and doubtless involves many factors . It is clearly under the control of the mechanisms which govern heredity , since the size to which an organ or body will grow is inherited , and only within rather narrow limits may this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Growth. ? We are accustomed to think of plants as organisms without the power of movement , but a careful observation of almost any plant part , over a period of time , will show that it changes its position and often very radically . The use of a motion-picture camera , whereby photo-graphs can be taken of the same plant at intervals of a few seconds , minutes , or hours and then run off rapidly on the screen , thus " speeding up " the plant 's motion very greatly , provides an excellent means for studying these movements . Many of them are directly due to inequalities in growth which bend the organ in one way or another . Those which are directed by an external stimulus such as light or gravity will be discussed in a later chapter . Some growth movements , however , seem to be directed entirely by internal factors . The changing positions of unfolding organs are thus due to unequal growth . In a flower bud , which " nods " when young and later becomes erect , these changes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the stalk and then on the other . Most remarkable of these motions is the constant rotation , or circumnutation , of young and growing stem tips which is due to a rhythmic alteration in such a differen tial growth rate . In plants which climb , this is especially advan tageous in carrying the stem around a support or in bringing its tendrils into contact with possible points of attachment . It has been observed that most species of climbers are con sistently either clockwise or counterclockwise ( " right-handed " or " left-handed " ) in their rotating growth movements . CHAPTER IX DEVELOPMENT AND MORPHOGENESIS The mechanism of heredity , which is responsible for the transmission of the traits of parent to offspring , is now fairly well known , but how this controls the process of growth is one of the most difficult and least understood of biological problems . A fertilized egg divides to form a group of cells . This enlarges and ' the rudiments of cotyledons and root soon become visible . As the embryo grows further , its organs assume a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parts of a typical plant similar in character to the parents from which it came . The same sort of orderly development may also be observed in the formation of plant organs from a meristem . Thus , at the growing point of a bean plant the first indication that a new leaf is to be produced is the appearance of three tiny swellings close together at one side of the meristem . By rapid cell multiplication these increase in size , and a strand of elongate cells appears which is connected with the differentiating vascular cylinder below . Each lobe expands in length and width , and soon the compound leaf of the bean plant has been formed in miniature though its parts are still closely folded together . As this grows , the relative proportions of each leaflet remain essentially the same . When the whole has reached a length of a few millimeters , the petiole begins to elongate , and soon the mature leaf , thousands of times bigger than the tiny primordium from which it grew , has developed . Similarly , the fruit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at maturity , may be traced in its development from a tiny group of cells so small as hardly to be visible to the unaided eye ; and its characteristic shape is already established when this primordium is only about one-millionth of its final size ( Fig. 134 ) . To watch an organ like this unfolding and passing through the same developmental stages which are precisely repeated in every similar organ and which are characteristic for that particular plant can not fail 252 // to impress one who observes it with the fact that growth and differentiation are taking place under a definite and orderly control of some sort . It is this which leads to the production of those precise bodily forms and structures which are so distinctive of living things . These are maintained even when the materials composing them are changed , and are restored when altered by external factors . A living thing is an organized and integrated structure , well named an organism . That branch of biology which is concerned with these developmental problems is called morphogenesis or experimental morphology . It involves not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ecology , together with biochemistry and biophysics . Mor phogenesis in a sense is the focal point of the biological sciences . Plants provide especially good material for morphogenetic study and many of the important advances in this field have been made with plant material . In the present chapter some of the main phenomena which can be observed in the develop ment of plants will be discussed , together with the more impor tant factors which have been shown by experiment to play a part in the developmental process . Correlation. ? The clearest expression of the fact of biological organization is the way in which the growth of one part of the plant is correlated with that of another . The relative growth of root to shoot , of nucleus to cell , of length to width in a developing fruit , of terminal bud to lateral bud ( Fig. 135 ) , are examples of this correlation . These parts always keep step with each other , so to speak . The growth activity of one is closely linked with that of another so that what develops is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In some cases the means by which growth correlation is brought about seems obvious . Nutrition , for example , is often an important factor . The root is chiefly dependent for its growth on food made in the leaves , so the size of the root system naturally is closely related to the size of the leaf system , either in a plant growing from seed or in roots developing from a cutting . Similarly , if a small branch bearing leaves and flowers is girdled so that food can not leave it , the size of the fruit which develops on it is proportional to the area of the leaves on the branch . The size of a seedling plant depends on the size of the seed from which it grows , since most of the seed is reserve food which is used by the seedling in its growth . Some correlations are clearly due to the stimulation of growth by other means than nutrition . Thus most fruits will not develop unless the ovules which they contain are fertilized and grow into seeds , and the size of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it contains . Evidently there is a chemi cal stimulation passing from the growing seed to the tissues of the ovary . Similarly , it has been shown that the growth of roots on a cutting placed in the soil is much greater if there are buds on the cutting , presumably because of a root-stimulating substance formed in these buds . Many growth relations , on the other hand , seem to be due to competition between parts or to the inhibition of one part by another . In some plants the presence of several growing fruits will prevent the development of any others , since these fruits // have , so to speak , a priority on the food manufactured by the plant . The growth of buds may be checked in the same way . When the terminal bud of a maturing cotton plant has stopped growing because the food supply has been diverted from it to the competitive lateral branches and fruits , it will begin to grow vigorously again if grafted on a young plant . In some tuber forming species the tubers are poorly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when there is little fruit . This competitive correlation can often be brought about artifically , as in the common practice of fruit thinning . If too many young fruits begin to develop on an apple tree , for example , the crop will consist of relatively small apples since there are many competitors for the food supply ; but if some of the young fruits are removed the rest will grow larger . In the same way , giant chrysanthemum blossoms are produced by removing all the flower buds on a plant except one . The practice of " topiary , " by which plants can be made to grow into odd and unusual forms , consists in cutting off some of the buds and thus stimulating a compensatory growth in others . In many cases true inhibition of one part by another occurs . Thus in a growing branch with a strong terminal bud , the lateral buds below will make relatively weak growth , but if the terminal bud is removed , the lower ones at once begin to grow actively . It has been shown that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downward and checks the growth of shoots below . Leaves , too , will sometimes inhibit the growth of buds below them ( Fig. 136 ) . Other cases of inhibition are more complex . A leaf which , if it remained attached to the plant , would soon stop growing may begin to grow again if cut off and rooted in the soil . Its existence as part of a larger correlated whole in some way limits its growth . In many cases , however , there is no obvious mechanism by which growth is correlated . Thus the various dimensions and parts of a developing organ , like a leaf or fruit , do not increase at the same rate , and the result is that structures of specific pattern are produced rather than spherical masses of tissue . Even here , however , there is a definite relationship , since the ratio between the growth rates of the two parts or dimensions remains constant . This is best shown by comparing the percentage or compound-interest rates , as can readily be done by // plotting the logarithms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such a case the points fall along a straight line shows that the relative growth rate does not change , regardless of the actual rate at which the structures are growing ( Fig. 137 ) . This relationship may be expressed by stating that the logarithm of x equals the logarithm of b plus k times the logarithm of y , in which x is one structure or dimension , y the other , b the value of y when x equals 1 ( thus determining the level of the relative growth line ) and k is a quantity , constant in value , which meas ures the slope of the line . If k equals 1 the two structures are growing at equal rates . If it is greater or less than 1 , one is growing faster than the other and a progressive change in relative // size , and thus in form , results ( Fig. 137 ) . The significant fact is that the ratio between the two rates remains the same . The mechanism by which this is controlled , and by which regular changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific organic patterns are thus produced , is unknown . Differentiation. ? The development of a specific form is not the only result of growth in a plant body . Equally significant is the fact that the various parts of the body become very different from one another in many respects . This phenomenon of differ entiation is the more remarkable since experiment has shown that groups of cells from many parts of the plant are able , if isolated , // to regenerate an entire plant of the same sort , thus showing that in their fundamental genetic constitution these cells are all alike . What it is that causes them to become visibly different while maintaining this genetic uniformity is another in the long list of difficult problems in plant development . Certain of the differences are large and conspicuous , notably that between the root and the shoot . These two main organ systems differ in external and internal structure , method of growth , physiological behavior , and other respects . They are set apart very early in the development of the young embryo , often at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , between the first-formed and the later parts of the shoot , especially in the character of their leaves . " Juvenile " foliage occurs in early development in eucalyptus , various conifers , and other plants ( Fig. 238 ) . Marked differentiation may take place as the plant enters the reproductive stage . Thus the common English ivy in the vegetative condition has a climbing stem with three-lobed leaves . Branches which bear the flowers do not climb , but grow away from their support , and possess ovate leaves . Cuttings made from these grow into upright tree-like plants quite unlike the typical ivy , to which they rarely revert . Evidently a profound differentiation has taken place in them . The origins of these differences between organs , of course , must be in the growing points from which they are formed . Whether the bud is to give rise to flowers or a leafy shoot depends on structural differentiations which take place in the early history of the bud meristem . Under certain conditions , notably of day length ( p. 272 ) , tiny buds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ axils of the leaf primordia . Under other conditions these are absent and -a vegetative branch develops . Sometimes the actual beginning of differentiation can be seen at particular cell divisions . In the simple fern Schizaea , for example , which grows by a single large apical cell , each daughter cell which is cut off from the lower surface of this cell itself divides into an outer and an inner one . Each divides again and the four cells thus formed give rise respectively to the epidermis , cortex , endodermis , and vascular cylinder . Such simple " cell lineages , " at least in the higher plants , are not common . Occasionally , however , it is possible to observe marked differences in two daughter cells which are to have // different fates . Thus in the growing region of certain roots , the last division of a surface cell produces two very unlike cells ( Fig. 138 ) . The one toward the apex is smaller , has denser protoplasm , and develops into a root hair . The other is larger , has less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems often to begin in some such way as this , but its onset is usually not clearly visible . How a given cell will differ from its neighbors depends in some way on its position in the general developmental pattern of the organ or organism . It has well been said that " the fate of a cell is a function of its position . " Polarity. ? Another remarkable feature of plant development is that along the stem and root or other structures that consist of a regular shaft or axis there seems to exist a definite polarity , so that if a piece is cut out , its two ends will behave in a different fashion . The end which was nearer the base of the shoot consistently regenerates structures unlike those from the end which had been nearer the tip . The most familiar example of this is provided by young stems of willow which under favor-able conditions produce new roots and shoots very readily . If a piece of young stem , in its leafless winter condition , is suspended in moist air in the normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roots will develop at the lower end , and shoots from the buds at the upper end . If such a stem is hung " upside down " roots will still tend to grow from the orig inally basal end ( now uppermost ) , and shoots from the originally apical end ( now below ) , as shown in Fig. 139 . Thus , the orig inally basal end tends to produce roots , and the originally apical // end to produce shoots , and this tendency is evident no matter how long or how short the pieces are and persists even when the usual relation to gravity is reversed . The analogy at once suggests itself to the behavior of a magnetized needle , in which there is always a " north " and a " south " end , not only of the original needle but of every piece into which it may subsequently be cut . Such polarity has been observed in the roots and stems of many plants and found to be very difficult or impossible to // destroy and to be largely independent of environmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willow , where the young stems hang downward , it is nevertheless the end next the main stem ( and thus morphologically basal ) , but which is now uppermost as far as actual position is concerned , which tends to produce roots . Inverted stems , with the apical end placed in moist soil , may be induced to form roots at that end and shoots at the other , but under these conditions growth is not so vigorous as when the stem is in its " normal " position . Rooted stems have sometimes been made to grow for several years in an inverted position without losing their original polarity , as is shown by the fact that when turned " right side up " again they will produce both roots and shoots much more strongly . Roots also show a polar character , though not in such conspicuous fashion . Thus , successive pieces cut off from the taproot of a dandelion will heal the cut surface of the apical end ( the one originally farthest from the rest of the plant ) by the formation of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other end of each piece . Polar relationships are important in growth . Vochting found that if he cut out a small piece of tissue from the swollen stem of a kohlrabi plant and put it back into its original position , the cut tissues would knit together again ; but that if the pieces were inverted before being replaced , this attachment would not occur , and the severed bit would die . Thus , in the process of budding and grafting it is important to have the polarity of the bud or scion correspond to that of the stock . Polarity has been observed among all groups of plants from the simplest to the most complex . There is evidence that even single cells are polarized . In one of the simple algae , which consists of a filament of cells attached by a specialized " holdfast , " it is possible to separate the individual cells temporarily by plasmolysis . After recovery each cell begins to develop into an entire plant . In such cases it is from the basal end that the holdfast cells develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as though the polarity of each cell were affected by its position in the original plant body . The physiological basis of polarity is also evident in the direction of movement of certain substances . The hormone auxin , // for example , will move toward the base of a stem but not in the opposite direction . Differences in electrical potential between different parts of the plant have often been shown , and may be related to these phenomena of polarity and thus ultimately to the problem of pattern , but as yet these problems are far from solution . Regeneration. ? The control which ties together the various parts of a plant as they develop operates not only during normal development , but after injury or loss of parts , for under these conditions the plant tends to restore the lost parts and the correlation which normally existed between them . This process is known as regeneration . The simplest cases are those where , as in many single-celled plants , a cell will repair itself . Similarly if a small portion of the terminal meristem of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tissue will be reshaped into a typical growing point again . If the meristem of a shoot is split down its center , each of the two halves will often regenerate into an entire stem . // Usually , however , loss involves more than the growing region and in such cases restoration of missing parts is accomplished by the development of new growing points . The most familiar example of this , and one which is of great importance in plant propagation , is the formation of roots on pieces of shoot which have been cut off from their own root system and have their basal ends placed in soil or water . This is an important method of producing many new plants from a single individual . Some-times the growing points from which these new roots develop were already present but dormant ( Fig. 140 ) . In any case the essential fact is that the stem has restored the missing root system and soon achieves a normal balance between root and shoot . An individual leaf cut off and placed in soil or water will some-times regenerate both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire plant , but leaves of most plants will develop only roots . // Other organs than roots may be restored after being removed . In all such cases the first structural change observed is typically the formation , on the wound surface , of a mass of swollen thinwalled cells known as a callus , out of which the new meristems begin to develop . Where adventitious buds , which will grow into new shoots , form at the surface of a leaf or a stem in this process of restitution it is sometimes possible to trace an entire shoot to a single cell of the epidermis . This cell , stimulated in some way to retrace its steps , so to speak , and become embryonic again , divides several times and the group of small cells thus formed inside its walls grows out into a young bud and finally into a shoot ( Fig. 142 ) . This fact is significant since it shows that a mature and rather specialized cell has not lost the power to form an entire plant . What prevents it from doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspect of the general problem of correlation . Tissue changes which restore lost parts are also of much // interest . In some plants a typical epidermis , provided with cuticle and stomata , will be regenerated from cells of the cortex or elsewhere which normally would have had a very different fate . If a vascular bundle , such as the vein of a leaf , is severed by an incision , the two ends will often become united by the development , around the edge of the cut , of new vascular tissue formed out of cells which had previously been simple parenchyma cells ( Fig. 143 ) . Even the whole anatomy of an organ may be altered . If an isolated petiole develops roots from its base and a shoot from its apex and thus functions as a stem rather than a petiole , its internal structure becomes stem-like . Here again there is evident the tendency to restore a complete , normal individual . Abnormal D evelopment. ? However precise and regular the processes of development may be in most cases , they sometimes are seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The science of teratology is concerned with the study , of such abnormalities and monstrosities , very many examples of which have now been described . Cones or more specialized flowers may grow out into leafy branches . Petals or stamens may become green and leaf-like . Stems may grow flat and strap-shaped or fasciated instead of round . Leaves may appear in most unusual situations . Ovaries , instead of remaining closed , may open and expose their ovules directly to the outside . Some of these abnormalities are so extreme that the plant soon // dies ; but in many cases they are not very serious . They show the enormously varied possibilities in a growing plant , and their study is proving of value in determining the factors controlling normal development . Morphogenetic Factors. ? The factors which so direct growth that it results in an orderly series of correlated developmental processes are as yet but vaguely understood . A rather wide variety of specific factors have been investigated , however , each of which appears to play some part in growth and development , though our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formulation of any general theory of morphogenesis . Water. ? Most important of any of the chemical substances in plants , as has been shown in previous chapters , is water . In addition to its other roles it seems also to play an important part in development , for if a plant is grown in an environment where water is abundant it will be markedly different from a similar one grown where the supply of water is deficient . This difference shows itself in many ways ? in size of cells , thickness of cell walls , relative development of vascular tissue , growth of cuticle , abundance of stomata per unit of leaf area , and many other respects , a study of which is one of the most important aspects of ecological anatomy . Water probably produces these effects in a variety of ways , as by modifying cell turgidity , by affecting the degree of hydration of the cytoplasm , and by changing the amount and rate of the transpiration stream . It may cause a more direct effect in the case of certain " amphibious " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and mermaid weed , which will grow either under water or on the shore and where some of the leaves may be borne in the water and some in the air . There is a marked difference in such plants between the submersed and the aerial leaves , the former being thin in texture and finely divided whereas the latter are like normal foliage . In such cases the watery medium evidently affects differentiation at the growing point , though whether it does so directly or through modification of gas , exchange , nutrition , or other conditions is uncertain . The structural changes found in xerophytes ( p. 306 ) are often regarded as adaptations which enable the plant to survive in an environment where water is scarce . Many of them , however , are more probably due to direct morphogenetic effects of // differences in water supply and may be of little or no advantage to the plant . This is especially true of changes in cellular characters which may be observed in leaves from successively higher levels in a tree . Toward the upper level all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller , there are more of them , and there is greater vein length per unit of leaf area and in general a thicker cell wall . These are characters associated with the xerophytic habit , but they are probably all due to the smaller cell size in the higher leaves which , in turn , results from the fact that these leaves , because of their position , obtain less water than do the lower ones . For this reason the cells of the developing upper leaves are unable to expand as much as those of the lower ones and the various structural differences follow . In plants under dry conditions , where transpiration is high , the vascular tissue is often relatively better developed than where water is abundant , and this has been regarded as an adaptation permitting the conduction of more water . Experiment has shown , however , that far less vascular tissue than a plant normally has is sufficient to transport its water supply . For example , a young corn plant from which all of its roots except one have been // severed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system less than 1 per cent of the normal area , will grow almost as well as one which retains its entire root system . The extreme development of vascular tissue under dry conditions therefore is probably not related to the physiological stimulus of greater conduction , but to some more indirect factor , perhaps the greater accumulation of carbohydrates . Gravity. ? Many plant parts show in their structure a definite relation to gravity . This is not evident in vertical axes , around which lateral organs are symmetrically distributed , as in the phyllotaxy of leaves , but is pronounced in those whose chief extent is in a horizontal direction . Here the upper and lower surfaces are often markedly different and a characteristic dor siventral structure is assumed . Leaves , rhizomes , and even flowers show this character . That it is related to gravity may be proved by placing such organs on a clinostat , which rotates them slowly , still horizontal , and thus exposes all sides equally to gravity . Under these conditions many asymmetrical or dorsi ventral structures return to radial symmetry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the maple , for example , the leaves arising from the upper sides of such branches , and the upper half of the side leaves , are much smaller than the corresponding lower ones ( Fig. 145 ) . Cross sections of larger horizontal branches show the effect of their position by the eccentric character of their growth rings . In gymnospermous plants , such as our coniferous trees , the lower side of each growth ring is thicker than the upper so that the pith is well above the center of the branch . In the angiosperms , strangely enough , just the reverse is usually the case . In many of these examples of dorsiventral structure it is difficult to distinguish the effect of gravity from that of other factors , especially of light . Gravity seems rarely to act directly in controlling structure , but rather by modifying other agents , especially the distribution of nutrients and growth substances ( p. 279 ) . Light. ? Aside from its primary significance in photosynthesis , light has important morphogenetic effects . The direction from which it comes determines to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stems . The intensity of illumination has also a profound effect upon structure . Leaves growing in relatively bright light , as on the south side of a tree , have a thicker palisade layer , smaller intercellular spaces , and a heavier epidermis than others on the same plant but exposed to weaker illumination ( Fig. 146 ) . In weak light , plants tend to show a pronounced change known as etiolation , the stems growing abnormally long and slender and the leaves being poorly developed ( Fig. 147 ) . Internally , the cells tend to be much elongated , and the vascular and supporting tissues weak . Whether strong light produces a substance which checks elongation or so affects the permeability or other characters of the cells that growth is abnormally distributed is still a matter of debate . In its phototropic effects light evidently causes a differential distribution of growth hormones , with consequent bending . Very intense illumination may also produce structural changes through its harmful effect on protoplasm . To the ultraviolet rays living substance is particularly sensitive , and in many plants the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a relatively small surface is exposed to very bright light . In some plants , for example , the leaves are so arranged that the // surface of the blade is presented to light of moderate intensity but only the edge to the brightest light . The quality , color , or wave length of light is also important in plant development . This is more difficult to study since lights of different colors in the same spectrum are of different intensities , and in comparing lights of two different colors care must be taken to have the intensities equal . In general it may be said that in the longer wave lengths , toward the red end of the spectrum , plants tend to become etiolated almost as much as in the dark . Blue light tends to check etiolation and to increase differentiation of tissues . Experiments in this field have yielded many contradictory results , however , and the relations of wave length of light to development , though undoubt edly important , are not at all clear . The relative length of light and darkness to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkable effect upon the character of the organs produced at the growing point . For many plants a long day and short night , such as occur in the // Northern Hemisphere in June , stimulate the development of vegetative structures ( leaves and stems ) only , and it is not until the days become considerably shorter that reproductive structures are formed . In other plants precisely the reverse is true , long days stimulating reproduction , and short ones confining the plant to a vegetative condition ( Fig. 148 ) . This photo periodism allows horticulturalists to force plants rapidly into flower or to hold them as long as desired in a vegetative state , by growing them under artificial illumination the duration of // which can be controlled . Typical " long-day " plants ( requiring a long day to flower ) are hibiscus , timothy , and radish ; typical " short-day " plants are ragweed , aster , bean , and tobacco . Some plants , like tomato , are but slightly affected by day length . The photoperiodic effect doubtless involves several metabolic processes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organs as well as of flowers . In some dioecious plants like hemp it is even possible to reverse the normal sex expression by changing the length of day , short days favoring the formation of female flowers and long days of male ones . In some plants the effect of day length is sharply localized . Often if a single young leaf is exposed to the day length which favors flowering in a given species , the bud in its axil will form flowers , but none elsewhere in the plant will do so . In other cases , however , the stimulus to flower formation may be carried from one part of the plant to a distant one . The effect of light in determining the distribution of certain growth substances is important in producing asymmetrical structures in those organs which are exposed to light on one side more than on another , and thus notably in horizontal organs . Here its effect is often hard to separate from that of gravity . Mechanical Factors. ? Another group of factors that have been widely studied as to their role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tension , compression , bending , swaying , and so on . Conflicting results have been obtained , but it is now generally agreed that , at least in many cases , a tension or pull on a growing plant organ like a stem tends to result in tissue with relatively small and thick-walled cells , whereas compression has the opposite effect . This is best seen in stems which have been bent at a rather sharp angle during growth , and where the convex side is thus under tension and the concave under compression . Plants swayed back and forth during growth develop an excess of mechanical tissue , particularly in the plane of the swaying . If a stem , even of a fair-sized tree , is prevented from swaying in the wind by being tied firmly with guy ropes , it has been found to be relatively thinner and weaker in the portion of the stem which is supported , and markedly thicker in the free part . The eccentric growth of the horizontal branches , already discussed , has been attributed // to the fact that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whether in all these cases the mechanical factors affect structure directly or whether they do so by modifying transpiration , nutrition , hormone distribution , or other activities of the plant is not known . Even in the development of the plant itself there are tensions set up because of unequal growth of tissues . In many young stems the cells of the pith tend to expand faster than those of the outer layers so that the former are being compressed and the latter stretched . If the stem is split lengthwise so that those tensions are released , the inner tissues expand and the outer ones contract so that each half curves outward . These internal strains perhaps play some part in cellular differentiations . Another factor , geometrical rather than strictly mechanical , is change in surface-volume relations . If a structure grows without change of form its volume increases much faster than its surface . When the surface is important physiologically , as in absorption , the balance between surface and volume is often maintained by the development of folds and wrinkles in the former . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chloroplasts of certain algae , highly complex in pattern , with the much smaller and nearly spherical ones of other plants . In a somewhat similar way the diameter of a tree trunk grows relatively faster than the rest of the tree , since the cross-sectional area of the trunk tends to keep pace with the volume of the tree which it must support . This is the same principle , of course , which determines that an elephant has relatively much stouter limbs than a mouse . Temperature .  --  The formative effects of temperature are more important than they were at first thought to be . It has been shown to play an important part in photoperiodic reactions , since the effect of a given length of day may be different at different temperatures . A species may even behave as a shortday plant at one temperature and a long-day one at another . More important , however , is the profound effect that temperature during germination has been shown to have on later plant development . If germinating seeds of winter wheat are left at a low temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will flower much earlier than they would have done otherwise , and may be used as spring wheat . This phenomenon of vernalizaDEVELOPMENT // tion is now being actively studied because of the possibility which it presents of radically changing the character of a plant by a simple modification of the environment . Its use has been especially emphasized by Russian agriculturalists , who see in it a hopeful means of improving crop plants . The problems involved in vernalization are difficult , since light as well as temperature is concerned in the result . Its effects are explained by assuming that a developing plant must go through a rather long series of stages , each a necessary precursor for the next . By exposing the embryo to low temperature at the very beginning of seedling development , the early steps in this series are telescoped into a shorter time , so to speak , and the whole process is accelerated . As the young seedling emerges , it is then in a relatively later stage of development than it would have been if started at a higher temperature . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much light on the problem of embryonic determination . Electricity. ? Finally , electric phenomena may play an important part in morphogenesis . The use of delicate instruments has shown that very weak electrical currents often flow through plant tissues and that different regions show constant electrical differences from other regions . Thus , between the tip of a vertical stem and the parts below it there may be a difference in electric potential which may cause a current to pass through the tissue . It has been suggested that even the two ends of a single cell may thus be electrically unlike and that each cell is perhaps to be regarded as a tiny electric battery . It may be that the polarity of axial structures , which has been discussed above , is essentially electrical in origin . Chemical Substances in General. ? The roles of various chemical elements in plant development have long been studied . All the so-called " essential " elements are doubtless concerned , but their particular effects are not well understood . Phosphorus , because of its relation to nucleic acid , is concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Calcium is associated with cell-wall formation . Nitrogen , from its presence in proteins and thus in protoplasm , is especially abundant in meristems . It is doubtful , however , whether any of these elements has a very important morphogenetic effect independently . // The relative abundance of certain chemical substances , however , has been shown to be of marked importance . This is particularly the case in the relationship between carbohydrates and nitrogen . When the former is relatively scarce and the latter ( usually in the form of nitrate salts ) relatively abundant , a condition often found among plants growing in heavily fertilized soil , there is active synthesis of new protoplasm , the development of leaves and stems is particularly vigorous , and flower buds either fail to form or are generally abortive . When carbohydrates are relatively abundant , as in plants actively carrying on photosynthesis but without a large supply of nitrogen , the differentiation of flower buds is stimulated , and abundant fruit is produced . By some mechanism the vigor of growth is directed to different structures in these two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have results similar to relative abundance and dearth of nitrogen . This chemical determination takes place very early in the development of a meristematic region . Thus in most apple trees the buds from which a season 's growth comes are formed the year before , and as early as the June of the previous summer it is determined whether a leafy branch or a flowering shoot will grow from a bud . The relative abundance of carbohydrates and nitrogen has other important morphogenetic effects . Cuttings from plants high in carbohydrates have been found to form larger root systems than ones relatively poor in these substances though having abundant nitrogen . Similarly , the relative size of root to shoot in a young seedling is greater in seeds which have a high proportion of carbohydrates to nitrogen . Evidently excess carbohydrate tends to stimulate the formation of roots and excess nitrogen that of shoots . The problem is not quite as simple as this , however , for water supply is also a factor , as is the particular character of the carbon and nitrogen compounds . The carbohydrate-nitrogen relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned with the distribution of roots and shoots . Growth Substances. ? Many specific chemical substances have been found to exert morphogenetic effects . The occurrence of " organ-forming substances " was suggested by the German physiologist Sachs many years ago . Since then , and especially by recent students of the problem , many substances have been // described which have marked importance in the growth and development of plants . Some of these , since they are formed in one part of the plant but produce their effects in another , have been compared to the hormones of animals and termed plant hormones or phytohorinones . Others have been called growth regulators . Vitamins ( p. 210 ) are also concerned with development and often can not well be distinguished from hormones . All these classes of chemical substances have important influences on plant growth and development but are effective in exceedingly small quantities , thus distinguishing them from nutrient materials which provide energy and building stuffs and are required in relatively large amounts . The former are often distinguished by the term growth substances . They are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such substances to be described were " wound hormones , " frequently produced at cut surfaces or other injuries and stimulating cell division just below such surfaces and finally the development of a layer of protective tissue . They seem to be responsible for most wound healing in plants . Some of these have been isolated in pure condition from wounded plant tissue and are able to induce cell division in other kinds of plants . The growth substances most thoroughly studied are the auxins . The presence of auxin and the effect which it produces were first demonstrated in experiments with phototropism ( p. 300 ) . In the very young seedling of oats and other grains the shoot is surrounded by a sheath or coleoptile . This is very sensitive to light and will bend toward light coming from one side because the cells on its darker side elongate more rapidly than those on the lighter one . If about a millimeter of the tip of the coleoptile is cut off , it will no longer bend toward the light , though when the tip is replaced on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a substance responsible for this sensitivity passes from the tip into the region just below , where bending occurs . If the tip is cut off and placed on a small block of agar jelly for a short time and if this agar block is then placed on one side of the decapitated stump which is left in the dark , this stump will bend away from the side on which the block is placed ' ( Fig. 149 ) . Auxin , the substance produced in the tip and passing thence into the agar block and // then the coleoptile stump , stimulates cell elongation in the region it enters and thus produces the bending . The amount of bending is used as a measure of the concentration of auxin in the blocks , and the " oat coleoptile test " is one of the standard methods of determining the amount of this substance in a given material . In the normal seedling , light coming from one side evidently results in the presence of less auxin on that side and the sheath therefore bends toward the light . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but only in the direction from tip to base . If a piece is inverted and auxin placed on the now upper but physiologically basal end , no movement of growth substance takes place . This is a notable example of physiological polarity . Several types of auxin can be extracted from plants and chemical analysis shows them to be organic acids of the indole acetic group . Other growth substances , as yet unidentified as to chemical composition , have also been found in plant tissues . Morphogenetic effects are not limited to substances which occur in plants , for many others , artificially synthesized in the labora tory , are able to produce effects on development similar to those of the natural growth substances . Indole-butyric acid , naphthalene-acetic acid , and a considerable list of others are in this group . // Growth substances have many other properties than the stimulation of cell elongation which is the one shown in phototropic reactions . The particular effects produced are characteristic for each and include many developmental processes . Some of the more important will be briefly discussed . Auxin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes . Shoots placed horizontally will tend to bend upward because auxin accumulates on their lower side under the influence of gravity and stimulates elongation there . Most roots , however , under the same conditions turn downward . Auxin checks elongation in these organs , so that the upper , relatively auxin-free , part grows faster . This difference between root and stem in response to auxin is probably due to the fact that roots are stimulated by very weak auxin concentrations , but inhibited by the stronger ones which stimulate the growth of stem cells . Meristematic activity , especially in the cambium , is clearly related to auxin . Thus in shoots of woody plants , cambium activity begins first near the opening buds and then moves progressively downward toward the larger branches and the trunk , and the appearance of auxin in the cambial tissues follows the same sequence . Root formation is also stimulated by auxin . The presence of a leaf or bud on a cutting increases the amount of roots it will form , and this has been shown to be due to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substances also markedly stimulate root formation ( Fig. 150 ) . In certain plants if the basal ends of cuttings are held in a solution of growth substance for a few hours and then placed in soil , roots will start to develop on them much more abundantly than in untreated cuttings ( Fig. 151 ) . This practice has proven of value in the propagation of many kinds of plants . Indole-acetic and indole-butyric acids are often used for this purpose . The formation of shoots has been shown in a number of plants to be due to a deficiency of auxin rather than to any shoot-forming substance . Thus by proper manipulation it is even possible to produce shoots at the base of an axis and roots at its apex . The phenomena of dominance and inhibition are clearly related to the activity of growth substances . When a terminal hud or shoot is present , the buds below it often fail to develop , // but will do so if the tip is removed . If suitable growth substance is placed on the cut stump , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secreting an inhibiting substance which passes downward from it and acts on the buds below , and this control can be imitated artificially . It has even been shown in one genus of plants ( Aster ) that the difference between a much-branched species and an unbranched one is related to the com paratively small amount of growth substance produced by the buds of the former in contrast to those of the latter . The // importance of this sort of control in determining inherited differences in the bodily forms of plants is obvious . The formation of abscission layers at the base of petiole and fruit stalks is also affected by growth substances . If a leaf blade is cut off , the petiole stump will soon fall because of the formation of an abscission layer ; but if growth substance is placed on the cut surface of the stump , abscission is delayed or prevented . More remarkable still , if a suitable growth substance is applied by spray to branches bearing leaves or fruits , these will often remain attached to the plant for a long time instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The premature fall of fruit may be prevented by this practice , and it has other useful applications . The problem of why it is that an ovary ordinarily requires to have its ovules fertilized before it will develop into a fruit is also explained as due to the action of growth substances produced by the growing seeds which are necessary to stimulate fruit development . Naturally seedless fruits are rich in growth substance , usually auxin , a fact which may explain their ability to grow without the stimulus of seeds . More important , how-ever , is the fact that the artificial application of various growth substances , by spray or otherwise , to ovaries where fertilization // has not taken place will in many cases cause these to develop into parthenocarpic fruits , which are entirely seedless ( Fig. 152 ) . This technique is already finding important practical applications . The differentiation of floral structures is often related in some way to specific growth substances . In the cocklebur , for example , if one shoot of a plant is grown in a photoperiod which stimulates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce flowers , even though it would not do so by itself . When a flowering shoot is grafted on a nonflowering one , the latter will flower ; and this will happen even if the cut surfaces of the two stems do not meet , but are merely in contact , with a piece of filter paper between them . This suggests that a growth sub-stance , produced where flowers are forming , can be transported and will stimulate flower formation in a distant part of the plant . Such " flower-forming " substances have been termed fiorigens ( compare Achlya , p. 515 ) . // The application of growth substances often results in abnormalities of various kinds . Stems or petioles may be bent because of local growth stimulation . Sometimes the growing points are affected in such a way that leaves or flowers with forms markedly abnormal are produced , a fact which makes it possible to destroy certain weeds by hormone sprays ( Fig. 153 ) . Patches of root-forming tissue are often produced , and frequently intumescences and tumor-like malformations ( Fig. 154 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the tumors of crown gall or " plant cancer " ( Fig. 283 ) , produced on many plants by a parasitic bacterium , it is apparently the agent which stimulates the abnormal growth . Similar in action , probably , are the various substances injected by insects into tplant , tissues . These are evidently important in determining // development , for the abnormal plant growths , or galls ( Fig. 155 ) , which result from the action of a particular species of insect are very definite and constant in structure and are entirely different from those due to another species . Galls of specific character are also produced by fungus attack ( Fig. 156 ) . // Various growth substances rouse plant tissues from dormancy and thus hasten growth . Important among these is ethylene , one of the constituents of illuminating gas . If one member of a pair of dormant winter buds of lilac , for example , is enclosed in a glass tube containing this substance , it will soon open and grow out into a new shoot , while its sister bud remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid germination and growth , a fact often of much com mercial value . A number of sub-stances ( and certain physical stimuli such as low temperature ) have been found to have this effect and presumably act to has-ten chemical changes involved in the process of ripening which are essential preliminaries to growth . Other substances serve to prolong dormancy and are thus of impor tance in the storage of fruits and vegetables ( Fig. 157 ) . The activity of the vitamins , already discussed ( p. 210 ) , is con cerned more with nutrition and growth in general than with spe-cific form changes , but the dif-ferential distribution of these substances in various parts of the plant body doubtless has important morphogenetic effects . Discovery of the activities of growth substances , some of which have been briefly described , has opened a wide field for investigation and has led to a better understanding of many problems in plant development , since they provide a mechanism for morphogenetic control . They should not be regarded as specific organ-forming materials , however , for the effects which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given substance may sometimes stimulate root formation but under other circumstances it may instead cause local cell expansion , cambial activity , fruit development , or bud inhibition . What , it , will do depends not so much on its own specific char286 BOTANY : PRINCIPLES AND PROBLEMS acter as on the specific way in which a part of the plant reacts to it . What makes this patterned difference in reactivity is the basic problem in morphogenesis , and a knowledge of growth substances is only one step , though a very important one , toward its solution . Genetic Factors ( see Chapter XII ) . ? The genetic constitution of a plant is obviously of great importance in controlling its development , but the chemical and physical means by which this control is brought about are so difficult to determine that but little progress has yet been made toward an understanding of them . An analysis of some of the developmental differences brought about by genetic changes , however , may provic ' - ' . ' le basis for a more complete analysis . Changes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the simplest of these differences and often produce important effects . Tetraploid plants usually have larger cells than diploid ones and the plant and its organs are often larger . Its leaves and fruit are relatively wider in proportion to length than are those of diploids so that increase in chromosome number in some way causes change in form as well as size . // Internal differentiation is sometimes related to polyploidy . Chromosome number can be determined only in dividing cells and these usually occur only at meristems . The cells of certain tissues , however , which have ceased to divide and have now become differentiated , may be induced to divide again by growth substances or other means . In such cases the chromosome number is often found to be twice or even four times as great as in the cells of the meristem , showing that multiplication of chromosomes , even though this was not visible , has taken place during differentiation . The form and structure of plants has repeatedly been shown to be controlled by genes ( p. 366 ) , and one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which these units of inheritance govern developmental processes . In the case of inherited shape differences it is evidently the relative growth of the various dimensions which is controlled . A major form difference may sometimes be produced by a single gene difference , as in the case of disk and sphere fruit shape ( p. 386 ) , while in others there are many genes concerned and form seems to be the result of a balance between them . Differences in internal structure are also clearly inherited , though these are less obvious . Relative cell size and shape , plane of cell division , character of the cell wall , and other differences are in some manner controlled by the gene mechanism . // One method of analyzing genetic effects is by a study of structures which are mixtures of two genetically different tissues . Such plants are known as chimeras . Sometimes a mutation or chromosome change may occur in a cell at the meristem and give rise to a sector of tissue different from the rest ( Figs. 158 and 159 ) . In other cases a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by colchicine treatment may have its outer one or two layers derived from one type and its inner portions from the other ( Fig. 160 ) . Thus it is possible to produce chimeras of which the outer layers are tomato tissue and the inner ones nightshade tissue and vice versa . Since these two plants differ in cell , leaf , and fruit characters , an opportunity is here provided to analyze the part which each portion of the meristematic region plays in the control of development and to compare the effects of different genetic constitutions which here are intimately associated . No genetic mixture takes place and the two layers maintain their specific characters . The layer of cells immedi ately below the surface layer produces the tissue from which gametes are formed , so that in its genetic behavior a chimera of this sort exactly resembles the one of its two components from which the subepidermal layer has been derived . The study of chimeras evidently offers a useful method of attack on a number of important botanical problems , // Organization. ? The most important fact which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tends to form an entire whole individual with a specific pattern and structure . The fate of any given part depends upon its position in this whole . If such a part is separated from the rest it will tend to form another complete whole . In some way there is implanted in living material a tendency to organize itself into a single unit , well called an organism , in which all parts are subordinate to a specifically patterned whole . Organization in a plant is much looser than in most animals , but it is present and seems to be a general characteristic of protoplasm , at least in all forms of life above the very simplest ones . Its most conspicuous expression is in specific structural forms , but it is also evident in physiological activities . Sometimes this organizing control breaks down and abnormal or formless growth of all sorts may occur . What this control is and how it is exercised are important problems , for biological organization is the basis of individuality and perhaps the most distinguishing characteristic of life itself . CHAPTER X THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussed various factors which control the development and structure of a plant . Some of these are internal and constitute the specific inherited constitution of the plant itself . Others are external and form part of the environment in which the plant lives . The relations between a plant and its environment are much more complex than these merely formative ones , however . A study of all such relations constitutes the subject matter of the science of plant ecology , some of the problems of which will be discussed briefly in this chapter . It is evident that even for the . same plant , growing in the same spot , the conditions of light , temperature , moisture , and various soil factors may change radically . Between two plants in different places , environmental differences may be even more pronounced . These various external factors vitally affect the way in which the plant functions , and it is therefore evident that if a plant is to thrive and maintain itself , it must be able to modify its form and activities to meet this ever-changing environment successfully . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organisms do possess , in greater or less degree , this characteristic of advantageous regulation of structure and function in conformity to the changing external world . As to what are the causes of these regulations there is much difference of opinion and no certain knowledge . In describing plant activities , most of which contribute so obviously to the welfare of the individual , one continually finds himself using terms which imply purpose or effort . It is very difficult to describe the facts of form and function in simple language without tacitly assuming that there is within the plant something which directs and regulates its life so that it will tend to do whatever is to its own best advantage . Such an assumption is , of course , quite contrary to a strictly scientific attitude toward living things , which demands for every 23 ) 4 // observed change a definite physical cause and not a psychological one ; and it introduces a deeper problem which is clearly the province of the philosopher rather than of the botanist . The latter should content himself with recording carefully all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with analyzing as carefully as possible the factors which seem to be responsible for these changes . Stimulus and Response. ? In such a study it is important to remember that the environmental forces do not act on the plant as they would on a lifeless body ? on a stone or a drop of water , for instance ? merely raising its temperature , illuminating its surface , pulling it down by gravity , or affecting it in other direct ways ; but , instead , that each of these forces acts as a stimulus which brings forth on the part of the plant a definite response . This may be either a change of function or a change of structure . To the same stimulus the response of one plant may be very different from that of another , and those of different parts of the same plant also may differ greatly . The stimulus is merely a trigger which releases a response , and the latter is often of much greater intensity than the stimulus which produces it . Just what a given response will be depends entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . This characteristic trait of protoplasm whereby it is continually reacting or responding to stimuli is known as irritability and is a distinctive quality of all living things . In animals , protoplasmic irritability is extraordinarily developed in nervous tissue , which receives the stimuli and controls the responses of the organism and has its highest expression in a specialized central organ , the brain . In plants , however , no nervous system has been differentiated , and although some regions are much more sensitive than others and evidently may transmit the effects of a stimulus for a considerable distance , it is the protoplasm of the ordinary cells which is chiefly concerned in the many responses made by the plant . Reactions in which protoplasmic irritability can be studied directly are apparent in the various movements which plants make as a result of environmental influences . Most of these are movements in a definite direction which is determined by the direction of the stimulus . Such movements are termed tropisms . Tropisms are responses to changes in the environ296 BOTANY : PRINCIPLES AND PROBLEMS ment , and should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( p. 248 ) , which are internally directed . The latter are sometimes called autonomic movements to distinguish them from paratonic ones , which are due to external causes . Although some plants ( like the sensitive plant , Mimosa ) are able to change the position of their parts by a modification of the turgidity of certain cells , plant movements are usually growth changes , and it is therefore the young and growing regions which are most sensitive to external stimuli and are able to respond to them . In any discussion of the effect of the environment one should not only consider the reaction of the individual plant , but should also look at the problem from the historical viewpoint and study those inherited characteristics which enable it to thrive in a particular environment and which have become implanted in the species during the course of its evolution . Adjustments of this kind , either of structure or of function , are usually spoken of as adaptations . The natural adaptations of cacti for desert life and of orchids for insect fertilization may be cited as examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as caused either directly or indirectly by the environment . Attention has been called to the complexity of the environment in which the plant grows . The first step in an analysis of the relations between this environment and the plant is to isolate the separate environmental factors and to study the specific effect of each . Of the wide range of such factors a few are particularly important and deserve consideration here , notably temperature , light , gravity , moisture , and various chemical substances , which constitute the inorganic environment ; and the surrounding plants and animals , the organic environment . Inorganic factors which are effective through the medium of the atmosphere are termed climatic ; those which act through the soil , edaphic . In most cases the reaction of a plant to a given factor depends upon the intensity or amount of that factor in the environment . Thus photosynthesis will go on very slowly at low light intensities , faster at higher ones and then slower in very bright light , until the process ceases . The lowest intensity of a given factor at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensity for that process ; the intensity at which the process is most rapid , its optimum ; and the highest intensity at which it will go on , itm // maximum ( Fig. 161 ) . A determination of these points is often useful for our knowledge of plant reactions , but one should understand that for one factor affecting a process these may vary considerably depending on some other factor which also affects it . Thus the rate of photosynthesis is related to the intensity of light , being low in weak and very strong light and most rapid in an intermediate intensity . But the amount of carbon dioxide present may also affect the rate of photosynthesis . If only a very little of this gas is available , photosynthesis will go on very slowly , even if there is an otherwise " optimum " intensity of light . Carbon dioxide is here a limiting factor in the process . At low light intensities , but with an abundance of carbon dioxide , on the other hand , light becomes the limiting factor . This principle of limiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a plant are affected by more ili , rn one environmental factor and the activity can not reach its maximum if any of these factors are below a certain level . // Temperature. ? It is characteristic of all vital processes that their maintenance is possible only within a comparatively narrow range of temperature , and temperature changes therefore produce marked responses in the activity of protoplasm . In general , active life is possible for the higher plants between 0 and 50 ? C. , although these limits vary much from one species to another . The various physiological processes which go on within a plant , such as photosynthesis , respiration , and growth , often respond differently to temperature , so that the optimum temperature for each , if no other factors are limiting , may be quite different . The temperature coefficient of a process , designated by the symbol Qlo , is often significant . It is the increase in rate of the process with each increase of 10 ? C. in temperature . Most chemical reactions double their rate , or more , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 2 or higher . Purely physical processes , on the contrary , have a much lower coefficient . It is thus sometimes possible to determine whether a given physiological process is primarily chemical or physical in character by determining its temperature coefficient . Members of the vegetable kingdom lack the high and delicately maintained body temperature which is characteristic of the higher animals , and the temperature of most plants follows rather closely that of their environment , absorbing heat or losing it as the environment becomes warmer or colder . The body temperature of the plant may sometimes fall a little below that of its immediate environment , owing to excessive radiation or evaporation ; or it may sometimes rise noticeably above it , owing to the release of heat during respiration , especially in regions where growth is active . The latter phenomenon is particularly conspicuous in the case of intense bacterial action , for the amount of heat liberated by the vigorous respiration of these lowly plants is often sufficient to raise the surrounding temperature markedly . The problem of the temperature relations of plants is further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may often become accommodated , or " hardened , " to temperatures higher or lower than the usual limits for the species . The resistance of plant tissues to heat and cold is dependent to some degree on maturity , for young and growing tissues are much more susceptible to injury therefrom than older ones . In general , within any particular species , the ability to withstand high and // low temperatures is correlated with the amount of water in the cells and particularly in the protoplasm itself . Where water is abundant , resistance tends to be low ; where it is scarcer , resistance is higher . The fatal effect of freezing temperatures on plant tissues is probably due to the removal of water from their cells rather than to direct injury of the protoplasm by cold . There are well-marked inherited differences in the temperature relations of plants . The optimum for an alpine plant must obviously be far lower than for a native of the tropics . Certain algae have their normal habitat in the water of thermal springs , and others in the frigid arctic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and some varieties of apple , peach , and plum are distinctly " hardier " than other varieties . The temperature of the soil is often of as much importance to the plant as that of the air , for the rate of absorption of water and salts depends in no small degree upon this factor . Here , too , inherited differences are very marked ; for although most plants will not thrive unless the soil is relatively warm , certain arctic and alpine species are able to carry on absorption at temperatures almost down to the freezing point . Light. ? The essential part which light plays in the life of green plants through its influence upon the process of photosynthesis has already been emphasized . From light rather than from heat , electricity , or other sources the plant derives the kinetic energy which it stores up in potential form in its food ; and in this important capacity of an energy provider light is therefore essential to all plants . This influence is evidently an indirect one , however , particularly in the case of nongreen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of light as long as their food supply holds out . The important influence of light in determining plant structure has been discussed in the previous chapter . Apart from these roles , light is responsible for many of the growth movements or tropisms of plants . Not all plants and not all parts of plants respond in the same way to this stimulus . As a general rule the stem will turn toward the source of light , the root away from it , and the leaf , by the twisting of its petiole , will assume a position in which the broad surface of the blade is at right angles to the light rays ( Fig. 162 ) . Any movement which is a specific reaction to the stimulus of light is known
