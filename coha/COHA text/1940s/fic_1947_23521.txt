THE SAILOR A Story V. S. PRITCHETT H E WAS lifting his knees high and putting his hand up , when I first saw him , as if crossing the road through that stringing rain , he were breaking through the bead curtain of a Pernambuco bar . I knew he was going to stop me . This part of the Euston Road is a beat of the men who want a cup of tea or their fare to a job in Luton or some outlying WWII . " Beg pardon , chum , " he said in an anxious hot-potato voice . " Is that White-chapel ? " He pointed to the traffic clogged in the rain farther down where the electric signs were printing off the advertisements and daubing them on the wet road . Coatless , with a smudged trilby hat on the back of his head so that a curl of boot polish black hair glistered with raindrops over his forehead , he stood there squeezing the water in his boots and looking at me , from his bilious eyes , like a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wondering why the crowd is laughing . " That 's St. Pancras , " I said . " Oh , Gawd , " he said , putting his hand to his jaw like a man with toothache . " I 'm all messed up . " And he moved on at once , gaping at the lights ahead . " Here , wait , " I said . " Which part of Whitechapel do you want ? Where have you come from ? " " Surrey Docks , " he said . " They said it was near Surrey Docks , see , but they put me wrong . I bin on the road since tenthis morning . " " Acton , " he read a bus sign aloud , recalling the bottom of the day 's misery . " I bin there , " and fascinated , watched the bus out of sight . The man 's worried mouth dropped open . He was sodden . His clothes were black with damp . The smell of it came off him . The rain stained from the shoulders of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It spread from dark blobs over his knees to his thighs . He was a greasy looking man , once fat and the fat had gone down unevenly like a deflating bladder . He was calming as I spoke to him . A sailor , of course , and lost . Hopelessly , blindly lost . I calculated that he must have wandered twenty miles that day exhausting a genius for misdirection . " Here , " I said . " You 're soaked . Come and have a drink . " There was a public house nearby . He looked away at once . " I never touch it , " he said . " It 's temptation . " THINK it was that word which eon- I vinced me the sailor was my kind of man . I am , on the whole , glad to say that I am a puritan and the word temptation went home , painfully , pleasurably , excitingly and intimately familiar . A most stimulating and austerely gregarious word , it indicates either the irresistible hypocrite or the fellow-struggler with sin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were in a caf ? drinking acrid Indian tea . " Off a ship ? " I said . He looked at me as if I were a magician who could read his soul . " Thank Gawd I stopped you , " he said . " I kep ' stopping people all day and they messed me up , but you been straight . " He gave me his papers , his discharge paper , his pension form , official letters , as he said this , like a child handing himself over . Albert Edward Thompson , they said , cook , born ' 96 , invalided out of the service two years before . So he was not just off a ship . " They 're clean , " he said suspiciously when I asked him about this . " I got ulcers , riddled with ulcers for fourteen years . " He had no job and that worried him , because it was the winter . He had ganged on the road , worked in a circus , had been a waiter in an Italian restaurant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whitechapel . He made it sound to me as though for two years he had been threshing about the country , dished by one job and another , in a less and less successful attempt to get there . " What job are you going to do ? " I said . " I do n't know , " he said . " It 's a bad time , " I said . " I fall on my feet , " he said , " like I done with you . " We sat opposite to each other at the table . He stared at the people in the cafe with his appalled eyeballs . He was scared of them and they looked scared too . He looked as though he was going to give a yell and spring at them ; in fact , he was likelier to have gone down on his knees to them and to have started sobbing . They could n't know this . And then he and I looked at each other and the look discovered that we were the only two decent , trustworthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next two hours I had given him a job . I was chum no longer , but " Sir . " " Chum " was anarchy and the name of any twisty bleeder you knocked up against , but " sir " ( for Thompson , out of the naval nursery ) was hierarchy , order , pay day , and peace . I was living alone in the country in those days . I had no one to look after me . I gave Albert Thompson some money , I took him to Whitechapel and wrote down the directions for his journey to my house . T rpHE bungalow where I lived was small and stood just under the brow of a hill . The country was high and stony there . The roads broke up into lanes , the lanes sank into woods and cottages were few . The oak woods were naked and as green as canker . They stood like old men , and below them were sweet plantations of larch where the clockwork pheasants went off like toys in the rainy afternoons . At night you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oceanic sound of the trees and sometimes , over an hour and a half 's walk away , the whistle of a train . But that was all . The few people looked as though they had grown out of the land , sticks and stones in cloth ; they were old people chiefly . In the one or two bigger houses they were childless . It was derelict country ; frost with its teeth fast in the ground , the wind running finer than sand through a changeless sky or the solitary dribble of water in the butts and the rain legging it over the grass  --  that was all one heard or saw there . " Gawdl " said Thompson when he got there . " I thought I 'd never strike the place . " Pale , coatless again in the wet , his hat tipped back from a face puddingy and martyred , he came up the hill with the dancing step of a man treading on nails . He had been lost again . He had traveled by the wrong train , even by the wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was safest to follow the crowd . But country crowds soon scatter . He had been following people  --  it sounded to me  --  to half the cottages for miles around . " Then I come to the common , " he said . " I did n't like the look of that . I kept round it . " At last some girl had shown him the way . I calmed him down . We got to my house and I took him to his room . He sat down on the bed and told me the story again . He took off his boots and socks and looked at his blistered feet , murmuring to them as if they were a pair of orphans . There was a woman in the train with a kid , he said , and to amuse the kid he had taken out his jackknife . The woman called the guard . After we had eaten and I had settled in I went for a walk that afternoon . The pleasure of life in the country for me is in its monotony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long war to which people , plants and animals have settled down . In the country one expects nothing of people ; they are themselves , not bringers of gifts . In towns one asks too little or too much of them . The drizzle had stopped when I went out , the afternoon was warmer and inert and the dull stench of cattle hung over the grass . On my way down the hill I passed the bungalow which was my nearest neighbor . I could see the roof as pink as a slice of salt ham , from the top of my garden . The bungalow was ten years old . A chicken man had built it . Now the woodwork was splitting and shrinking , the garden was rank , two or three larches , which the rabbits had been at , showed above the dead grass and there was a rosebush . The bush had one frozen and worm-eaten flower which would stick there half the winter . The history of the bungalow was written in the tin bath by the side door . The bath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discarded after the weekend parties of many tenants . People took the place forever and then , after a month or two , it changed hands . A business man , sentimental about the country , an invalid social worker , a couple with a motor bicycle , an inseparable pair of schoolteachers with big legs and jumping jumpers ; and now there was a woman I hardly saw , a colonel 's daughter , but the place was said to belong to a man in the Northampton boot trade . A GRAMOPHONE was playing when I walked by . Whenever I passed , the colonel 's daughter was either playing the gramophone or digging in the garden . She was a small girl in her late twenties , with a big knowlegeable-looking head under tobacco-brown curls , and the garden fork was nearly as big as herself . Her gardening never lasted long . It consisted usually of digging up a piece of the matted lawn in order to bury tins ; but she went at it intensely , drawing back the fork until herhair fell over her face and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cigarette in her mouth , and every now and then the carnation skin of her face , with its warm , dark-blue eyes , would be distorted and turned crimson by violent bronchial coughing . When this stopped she would straighten up , the delicacy came back to her skin and she would say , " Oh , Christ . Oh , bloody hell " and you noticed at the end of every speech the fine right eyebrow would rise a little and the lid of the eye below it would quiver . This wink , the limpid wink of the colonel 's daughter , you noticed at once . You wondered what it meant and planned to find out . I t was as startling and enticing as a fish rising , and you discovered when you went after it that the colonel 's daughter was the hardest drinking and most blasphemous piece of apparent childish innocence you had ever seen . Old men in pubs gripped their sticks , went scarlet and said someone ought to take her drawers down and give her a tanning . I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonel 's daughter . " Who 's that piece we saw down the road ? " people asked . " Her father 's in the Army . " " Not , " two or three of them said , for this kind of wit spreads like measles , " the Salvation Army . " They said I was a dirty dog . But I hardly knew the colonel 's daughter . Across a field she would wave , utter her obscenity , perform her wink and edge off on her slight legs . Her legs were not very good . But if we met face to face on the road she became embarrassed and nervous ; this was one of her dodges . " Still alone ? " she said . " Yes . And you ? " " Yes . What do you do about sex ? " " I have n't got any . " " Oh , God , I wish I 'd met you before . " When I had friends she would come to the house . She dare n't come there when I was alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she locked and bolted up at six . Then the wink  --  if it was a wink . The men laughed . She did not want to be raped , she said . Their wives froze and some curled up as if they had got the blight and put their hands hard on their husbands ' arms . But the few times she came to the house when I was alone , the colonel 's daughter stood by the door , the full length of the room away , with a guilty look on her face . When I came back from my walk the gramophone had stopped . The colonel 's daughter was standing at the door of her bungalow with her sleeves rolled up , a pail of water beside her and a scrubbing brush in her hand . " Hullo , " she said awkwardly . " Hullo , " I said . " I see you got the Navy down here . I did n't know you were that way . " " I thought you would have guessed that straight away , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 've broken his heart . " Suddenly she was taken by a fit of coughing . " Well , " she said . " Every day brings forth something . " When I got to the gate of my bungalow I saw that at any rate if Thompson could do nothing else he could bring forth smoke . It was traveling in thick brown funnel puffs from the short chimney of the kitchen . The smoke came out with such dense streaming energy that the house looked like a destroyer racing full steam ahead into the wave of hills . I went down the path to the kitchen and looked inside . There was Thompson , not only with his sleeves rolled up but his trousers also , and he was shoveling coal into the kitchener with the garden spade , the face of the fire was roaring yellow , the water was throbbing and sighing in the boiler , the pipes were singing through the house . " Bunkering , " Thompson said . I went into the sitting room . I thought I had come into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floors polished like decks , the reflections of the firelight danced in them , the windows gleamed and the room was glittering with polished metal . Doorknobs , keyholes , fire-irons , window-catches were polished ; metal which I had no idea existed flashed with life . " What time is supper piped  --  er ordered , " said Thompson , appearing in his stockinged feet . His big round eyes started out of their dyspeptic shadows and became enthusiastic when I told him the hour . A CHANGE came over my life after this . Before Thompson everything had been disorganized and wearying . He drove my papers and clothes back to their proper places . He brought the zest and routine of the Royal Navy into my life . He kept to his stockinged feet out of tenderness for those orphans , a kind of repentance for what he had done to them ; he was collarless and he served food with a splash as if he allowed for the house to give a pitch or a roll which did n't come off . His thumbs left their marks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived for " orders . " " All ready , sir , " he said planking down the dish and looking up at the clock at the same moment . Burned , perhaps , spilling over the side , invisible beneath Bisto  --  but on time ! The secret of happiness is to find a congenial monotony . My own housekeeping had suffered from the imagination . Thompson put an end to this tiring chase of the ideal . " What 's orders for lunch , sir ? " " Do you a nice fried chop and chips ? " he said . That was settled . He went away but soon he came back . " What pudding 's ordered , sir ? " That stumped both of us , or it stumped me . Thompson watched me to time his own suggestion . " Do you a nice spotted dick ? " So it was . We had this on the second day and the third , we changed on the fourth , but on the fifth we came back to it . Then Thompson 's mind gave a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spotted dick and custard ? " he said . That became almost our fixed menu . There were bouts of blanc-mange , but spotted dick came back . Thompson had been sinking towards semi-starvation , I to the insidious Ohlomovism of the country . Now we were reformed and happy . " I always fall on my feet , " he said , " like I done with you . " It was his refrain . MHE winter dripped like a tap , the fog . I hardly left our hill . Winter in England has the colorless , steaming look of a fried-fish shop-window . But we were stoking huge fires , we bunkered , the garden spade went through coal by the hundredweight . We began to talk a more tangy dialect . Things were not put away ; they were " stowed . " String appeared in strange knots to make things " fast , " plants were " lashed " in the dying garden , washing was " hoist " on the lines , floors were " swabbed . " The kitchen became the " galley . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were " piped " and at bedtime we " piped down . " At night , hearing the wind bump in the chimneys and slop like ocean surf in the woods , looking out at the leather darkness , I had the sensation that we were creeping down the Mersey in a fog or lumping about in the Atlantic swell off Ushant . I was happy . But was Thompson happy ? He seemed to be . In the mornings we were both working , but in the afternoons there was little more to do . He sat on a low chair with his knees close to the bars of the range or on the edge of his bed , darning his clothes . ( He lived in a peculiar muddle of his own and he was dirty in his own quarters . ) In the evenings he did the same and sometimes we talked . He told me about his life . There was nothing in it at all . It was buried under a mumble of obscurity . His memories were mainly of people who had n't " behaved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about in it , disappointed with human nature . He did n't stay to talk with me much . He preferred the kitchen where , the oil-lamp smoking , the range smoking and himself smoking , he sat chewing it all over , gazing into the fire . " You can go out , you know , " I said , " whenever you want . Do what you like . " " I 'm O.K. , " he said . " See some of the people , " I said . Thompson said he 'd just as lief stand by . Everyone knows his own business best . But I was interested one night when I heard the sound of voices in the kitchen . Someone had come in . The voices went on on other nights . Who was it ? The milker from the farm probably or the cowman who cleaned out cess pits by lantern light at night and talked with nostalgia about burying bodies during the war . " If there had n't been a war , " this man used to say , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I listened . Slow in question , slow in answer , the monotonous voices came . Thewoodcutter , the postman ? I went into the kitchen to see who the profound and interminable crony was . There was no one . There was only Thompson in the kitchen . Sitting close to the fire with all windows closed , a sallow , stupefied , oil-haired head in his own fug , Thompson was spelling out a story from a Wild West Magazine . It was old and dirty and his coal-blackened finger was moving from word to word . S o FAR Thompson had refused to go out of the house except as far as the coal-shed , but I was determined after this discovery that he should go out . I waited until payday . " Here 's your money , " I said . " Take the afternoon off . " Thompson stepped back from the money . " You keep it , " he said , in a panic . " You keep it for me . " " You may need it , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or something . " " If I have it lose it , " he said . " They 'll pinch it . " " Who ? " I said . " People , " Thompson said . I could not persuade him . " AEI right , I 'll keep it for you , " I said . " Yes , " he said eagerly . " If I want a bob I 'll ask you . Money 's temptation , " he said . " Well , anyway , " I said , " take the afternoon off . It 's the first sunny afternoon we 've had . I 'll tell you where to go . Turn to the right in the lane . , . " " I do n't like them lanes , " said Thompson , looking suspiciously out of the window . " I 'll stay by you . " " Well , take a couple of hours , " I said . " We all need fresh air . " He looked at me as if I had suggested he should poison himself ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What if I do an hour ? " he began to bargain . " No , the afternoon , " I said . " Do you half an hour ? " he pleaded . " All right , I do n't want to force you , " I said . " This is a free country . Go for an hour . " It was like an auction . " Tell you what , " he said , looking shifty . " I 'll do you twenty minutes . " He thought he had tricked me , but I went back into the kitchen and drove him to it . I had given him an overcoat and shoes , and it was this appeal to his vanity which got him . Out he went for his twenty minutes . He was going straight down the lane to where it met the main road and then straight back ; it would take a smart walker about twelve minutes on a winter 's day . When an hour passed I was pleased with myself . But when four hours had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went out to the gate . The land and the night had become one thing . I had just gone in again when I heard loud voices and saw the swing of a lamp . There came Thompson with a laborer . The laborer , a little bandy man known as Fleas , stood like a bent bush with a sodden sack on his shoulders , snuffling in the darkness , and he grinned at me with the malevolence of the land . " He got astray , " he said , handing Thompson over . ' . Gawd , " exclaimed Thompson , exhausted . His face was the familiar pale suety agony . He was full of explanations . He was sweating like a scared horse and nearly hysterical . He 'd been on the wrong course . He did n't know where to steer . One thing looked like another . Roads and lanes , woods and fields , mixed themselves together . " Woods I seen , " he said in horror . " And that common ! It played me up proper . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Then what was it ? " he said . That night he sat by the fire with his head in his hands . " I got a mood , " he said . /vim next morning cigarette smoke blew I past my window and I heard coughing . The colonel 's daughter was at the kitchen door talking to Thompson . " Cheero , " I heard her say and then she came to my door and pushed it open . She stood there gravely and her eye winked . She was wearing a yellow jersey and looked as neat as a bird . " You 're a swine , " she said . " What have I done ? " " Raping women on the common , " she said . " Deserting your old friends , are n't you ? " " It 's been too wet on the common , " I said . " Not for me , " she said . " I 'm always hopeful , I came across last night . There was the minister 's wife screaming in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her down and she said a man had been chasing her . ' Stop screaming , ' I said . ' You flatter yourself , dear . ' It was getting dark and I carried her shopping bag and umbrella for her and took her to her house . I often go and see her in the evenings . I 've got to do something , have n't P I ca n't stick alone in that bungalow all day and all night . We sit and talk about her son in China . When you 're old you 'll be lonely too . " " What happened on the common ? " " I think I 'm drunk , " said the colonel 's daughter , " but I believe I 've been drunk since breakfast . Well , where was I ? I 'm losing my memory too . Well , we had n't gone five minutes before I heard someone panting like a dog behind us and jumping over bushes . Old Mrs. Stour started screaming again . ' Stand still , ' I said , and I looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten yards away . ' What the hell do you want ? ' I said . A noise came back like a sheep . ' Ma'am , ma'am , ma'am , ma'am , ' it said . " " So that 's where Thompson was , " I said . " I thought it was you , " the colonel 's daughter said . " ' There 's a woman set about me with a stick on the common , ' he said . did n't touch her , I was only following her , ' he said . ' I reckoned if I followed her I 'd get home . ' " When they got to the wood Thompson would n't go into it and she had to take his hand ; that was a mistake . He took his hand away and moved off . So she grabbed his coat . He struggled after this , she chased him into the thicket and told him not to be a fool , but he got away and disappeared , running on to the common . " You 're a damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How would you like to be put down in the middle of the sea ? " She walked away . I watched her go up the path and lean on the gate opposite to stroke the nose of a horse . She climbed into the field and the horses , like hairy yokels , went off . I heard her calling them but they did not come . When she was out of sight , the door opened behind me and Thompson came in . " Beg pardon , sir , " he said . " That young lady , sir . She 's been round my kitchen door . " " Yes , " I said . He gaped at me and then burst out : " I did n't touch her , straight I did n't . I did n't lay a finger on her . " " She did n't say you did . She was trying to help you . " He calmed down . " Yes , sir , " he said . When he came back into the room to lay the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sir , " he said at last , standing at at-tention . " Beg pardon , sir , the young lady . . . " His mouth was opening and shutting , trying to shape a sentence . " The young lady  --  she 'd had a couple , sir , " he said in a rush . " Oh , " I said , " do n't worry about that . She often has . " " It 's ruination , sir , " said Thompson evangelically . She did not come to the house again for many days , but when she came I heard him lock both kitchen doors . O RDERS at the one extreme , temptation at the other , were the good and evil of Thompson 's life . I no longer suggested that he go out . I invented errands and ordered him to go . I wanted , in that unfortunate way one has , to do good to ' Thompson . I wanted him to be free and happy . At first he saw that I was not used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were bad , he said . Once or twice he %vent about barefoot , saying the sole was off one of his boots . But when he saw I meant what I said , he went . I used to watch him go , tilted forward on his toes in his half-running walk , like someone throwing himself blindly upon the mercy of the world . When he came back he was excited . He had the look of someone stupefied by incomprehensible success . It is the feeling a landsman has when he steps off aboat after a voyage . You feel giddy , canny , surprised at your survival after crossing that bridge of deep , loose water . You boast . So did Thompson  --  morally . " There was a couple of tramps on the road , " Thompson said . " I steered clear . I never talked to them , " he said . " Someone asked me who I was working for . " He described the man . " I never told him , " he said shrewdly . " I just said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . There was a man in a roadside garden who had asked him for a light and wanted to know his business . " I told him I did n't smoke , " said Thompson . " You see my meaning  --  you do n't know what it 's leading up to . There war n't no harm , but that 's how temptation starts . " What was temptation ? Almost everything was temptation to Thompson . Pubs , cinemas , garden lots , chicken-runs , tobacconists  --  in these , everywhere , the tempter might be . Temptation , like Othello 's jealousy , was the air itself . " I expect you 'd like to go to church , " I said . He seemed that kind . " I got nothing against religion , " Thompson said . " But best keep clear . They see you in church and the next thing they 're after you . " " Who ? " I asked . " People , " he said . " It 's not like a ship . " I was like him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I kept out of temptation 's way . He was glad I was like that , he said . It was a shock to me that while I observed Thompson , Thompson observed me . At the same time one prides oneself , the moment one 's character is defined by someone else , on defeating the definition . I kept myself to myself ? I avoided temptation ? That was all Thompson knew ! There was the colonel 's daughter . I might not see her very often ; she might be loud , likable , dreary , or alarming by turns , but she was Temptation itself . How did he know I was n't tempted ? Thompson 's remark made me thrill . I began to sec rather more of the colonel 's daughter . A D so I discovered how misleading he had been about his habits and how , where temptation was concerned , he made a difference between profession and prac-lice . So strong was Thompson 's feeling about temptation that he was drawn at once to every tempter he saw . He stopped them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The postman was told . The shopkeepers heard all his business and mine . He hurried after tramps , he detained cyclists , he sat down on the banks with road-makers and ditchers , telling them the dangers of drink , the caution to be kept before strangers . And after he had done this he always ended by telling them he kept himself to himself , avoided drink , ignored women and , patting his breast pocket , said that was where he kept his money and his papers . He behaved to them exactly as he had behaved with me two months before in the Euston Road . The colonel 's daughter told me . She picked up all the news in that district . " He 's a decent , friendly soul , " muttered the colonel 's daughter thickly . " You 're a prig . Keep your hair on . You ca n't help it . I expect you 're decent , too , but you 're like all my bloody so-called friends . " " Oh , " 1 said hopefully , " are prigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why Thompson was always late when he came home from his errands . I had always accepted that he was lost . And so he was in a way , but he was lost through wandering about with people , following them to their doorsteps , drifting to their garden lots , backyards and , all the time , telling them , as he clung to their company , about the dangers of human intercourse . " I never speak to nobody " ? it was untrue , but it was not a lie . It was simply a delusion . " He lives in two worlds at once , " I said to the colonel 's daughter one morning . I had sent Thompson to the town to buy the usual chops , and I was sitting in her bungalow . This was the first time I had ever been in it . The walls were of varnished match-boarding like the inside of a gospel hall and the room was heated by a paraffin stove which smelled like armpits . There were two rexine-covered chairs , a rug and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gramophone records as I talked and the records she did not like she dropped to the floor and broke . She was listening very little to what I said but walked to the gramophone , put on a record , stopped it after a few turns and then switching it off , threw the record away . " Oh , you know a hell of a lot , do n't you ? " she said . " I do n't say you 're not an interesting man , but you do n't get on with it , do you ? " " How old are you ? Twenty-five ? " Her sulking , ironical expression went . She was astonished . " Good God ! " she exclaimed with a smile of sincerity . " Do n't be a damn fool . " Then she frowned . " Or are you being professionally clever ? " Here , " she said . " I was damn pretty when I was twenty-five . I 'm thirty-nine . I 've still got a good figure . " " I would have put you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . S HE , walked towards me . I was sitting on the arm chair and she stood very close . She had never been as dose to me before . I had thought her eyes were dark-blue but now I saw they were green and gray , with a moist lascivious haze in them and yet dead and clock-like , like a cat 's on a sunless day . And the skin , which had seemed fresh to me , I saw in its truth for the first time . It was clouded and flushed , clouded with that thickened pimpled ruddiness which the skin of heavy drinkers has and which in middle-age becomes bloated and mottled . I felt : this is why she has always stood the length of the room away before . She saw what was in my mind and she sat down on the chair opposite to me . The eye winked . " Keep control of yourself , " she said . " I came down here for a rest and now you 've started coming round . " " Only in the mornings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a bookshelf and took down a bottle of whiskey and poured out half a tumblerful . " This is what you 've done coming in here , early bird , " she said . " Exciting me on an empty stomach . I have n't touched it for ten days . I had a letter this morning . From my old man . " " Your father ? " I had always tried to imagine the colonel . She gave a shout of cheerful laughter and it ended in coughing till tears came to her eyes . " That 's right . God , that 's rich . Keen observer of women ! No , from my husband , darling . He 's not my husband , damn him , of course , but when you 've lived with someone for ten years and he pays the rent and keeps you , he is your husband , is n't he ? Or ought to be . Ten years is a long time and his family thought he ought to be married . He thought so too . So he picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take it easy in the country . I 'm on the dole like your sailor boy . Well , I said , if he felt that way , he 'd better have his head . In six months he 'll tire of the new bitch . So I left him alone . I did n't want to spoil his fun . Well , now , he writes me , he wants to bring his fiancee down because she 's heard so much about me and adores the country . . " I was going to say something indignant . " He 's nice too , " she said casually . " He sells gas heaters . You 'd like him all the same . But blast that bloody woman , " she said , raising her cool voice . " She 's turned him into a snob . I 'm just his whore now . " Do n't look so embarrassed , " she said . " I 'm not going to cry . " For tenyears , " she said , " I read books , I learned French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do , ' instead of ' Pleased to meet you , ' and look down my nose at everything in his sort of way . And I let him go about saying my father was in the Army too , but they were such bloody fools they thought he must be a colonel . They 'd never heard of sergeant-majors having children . Even my old man , bless his heart , " she smiled affectionately , " thought or let himself think they did . I was a damn silly little snob . " " I do n't know him , " I said . " But he does n't sound much good to me . " " That 's where you 're wrong , " she said sharply . " Just weak , poor kid , that 's all . You do n't know what it is to be ashamed your mother 's a housemaid . I got over it ? but he did n't , that 's all . " She paused and the wink gave its signal . " This is more embarrassing than I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " Actually I am in favor of snobbery , it is a sign of character . It 's a bad thing to have , but it 's a bad thing not to have had . You ca n't help having the diseases of your time . " " There you go , " she said . The suffering of others is incredible . When it is obscure it seems like a lie ; when it is garish and raw , it is like boasting . It is a challenge to oneself . I got up from my chair and went towards her . I was going to kiss her . " You are the sentimental type , " she said . So I did n't kiss her . T PT1HEN we heard someone passing the bungalow and she went to the window . Thompson was going by . The lock of black hair was curling over his sweating forehead and he gave a hesitant staggering look at the bungalow . There was a lump of fear on his face . " He 'd better not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved her lips to be kissed , but I walked out . I was glad of the steady sense of the fresh gray air when I got outside . I was angry and depressed . I stood at the window of my house . Thompson came in and was very talkative . He 'd been lost , of course . He 'd seen people . He 'd seen fields . He 'd heard trees . He 'd seen roads . I hardly listened . I was used to the jerky wobbling voice . I caught the words " legion " and " temptation , " and thought he was quoting from the Bible . Presently I realized he was talking about the British Legion . The postman had asked him to go to a meeting of the British Legion that night . How simple other people 's problems are ! Yet " No " Thompson was saying . He was not going to the British Legion . It was temptation . I ought to have made love to her and kissed her , I was thinking . She was right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said to Thompson , " if you want to . You 'd enjoy it . " But how disgusting , obvious , stupid , to have made love to her then , I thought . " Do as you like , " I said . " I 'm best alongside you , " said Thompson . " You ca n't always be by me , " I said . " In a month , perhaps less , as you know , I 'll be leaving here and you 'll have to go . " " Yes , " he said . " You tol ' me . You been straight . I 'll be straight with you . I wo n't go to the Legion . " We ate our meal and I read . " In every branch of our spiritual and material civilization we seem to have reached a turning point , " I read . " This spirit shows itself not only in the actual state of public affairs . . . " Well , I thought , I can ask her over tonight . I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour . When I returned Thompson was fighting Temptation hard . If he went to the Legion how would he get back ? No , best not . He took the Legion on in its strength . ( She is a type , I thought . ) At four he was still at it . At five he asked me for his money . ( Well , we are all types , I was thinking . ) Very shortly he brought the money back and asked me to keep his pension papers . At half-past six I realized this meant that Thompson was losing and the Legion and all its devils winning . ( What is a prig , anyway ? ) He was looking out at the night . Yet , just when I thought he had lost , he had won . There was the familiar sound of the Wild West monologue in the kitchen . It was half-past eight . The Legion was defeated . I was disappointed in Thompson . Really , not to have had more guts than that ! Restlessly I looked out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tail of a dying wind . Under the moonlight the fields were like wide-awake faces , the woods like womanish heads of hair upon them . I put on my hat and coat and went out . I was astonished by the circle of stars . They were as distinct as figures on a clock . I took out my watch and compared the small time in my hand with the wide time above . Then I walked on . There was a sour smell at the end of the wood where , no doubt , a dead rabbit or pigeon was rotting . I came out of the wood on to the paved road . Suddenly my heart began to beat quickly as / hurried down the road , but it was a long way round now . I cut across fields . There was a cottage and a family was listening to a dance band on the wireless . A man was going the rounds of his chickens . There was a wheelbarrow and there were spades and steel bars where a water mill was being built . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My heart throbbed heavily and I felt all my blood slow down and mylimbs grow heavy . It was only when I got to the road that I saw there were no lights in the bungalow . The colonel 's daughter , the sergeant 's daughter , had gone to bed early like a child . While I stood I heard men 's voices singing across the fields . It must have passed ten o'clock and people were coming out of the public house . In all the villages of England , at this hour , loud-voiced groups were breaking up and dispersing into the lanes . GOT to my house and lit a candle . The I fire was low . I was exhausted and happy to be in my house among my own things , as if I had got into my own skin again . There was no light in the kitchen . Thompson had gone to bed . I grinned at the thought of the struggles of poor Thompson . I picked up a book and read . I could hear still the sound of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this part of the country but it made people sing . The singing voices came nearer . I put down the book . An argument was going on in the lane . I listened . The argument was nearing the cottage . The words got louder . They were going on at my gate . I heard the gate go and the argument was on my path . Suddenly  --  there could be no doubt  --  people were coming to the door . I stood up , I could recognize no voice . Loud singing , stumbling feet , then bang ! The door broke open and crashed against the wall . Tottering , drunk , with their arms round each other , Thompson and the colonel 's daughter nearly fell into the room . Thompson stared at me with terror . " Stand up , sailor , " said the colonel 's daughter , clinging to him . " He was lonely , " she said unsteadily to me . " We 've been playing gramophone records . Sing , " she said . Thompson was still staring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . Then she gave a low laugh and they fell , bolt upright on the sofa like prim , disheveled dolls . A look of wild love of all the world came into Thompson 's eyes and he smiled as I had never seen him smile before . He suddenly opened his twitching mouth and bawled : " You 've robbed every tailor , And you 've skinned every sailor , But you wo n't go walking Paradise Street no more . " " Go on . That 's not all , " the colonel 's daughter cried and sang , " Go onsomething  --  something , deep and rugged shore . " She put her arms round his neck and kissed him . He gaped at her with panic and looked at her skirt . It was undone . He pointed at her leg in consternation . The sight sobered him . He pulled away his arms and rushed out of the room . He did not come back . She looked at me and giggled . Her eyes were warm and shining . She picked leaves off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's he gone ? " she kept asking . " He 's gone to bed , " I said . She started a fit of coughing . It strained her throat . Her eyes were dilated like an animal 's caught in a trap , and she held her hand to her chest . " I wish , " she cried hysterically , pointing at me in the middle of her coughing , " I wish you could see your bloody face . " She got up and called out . " Thompson ! Thompson ! " And when he did not answer she sang out , " Down by the deep and rugged shore  --  ore-ore-ore . " " What 's the idea ? " I said . " I want Thompson , " she said . " He 's the only man up here . " Then she began to cry . She marched out to his room , but it was locked . She was wandering through the other rooms calling him and then she went out , away up the path . She went calling him all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thompson appeared as I usual . He brought the breakfast . He came in for " orders . " Grilled chop , did I think ? And what about spotted dick ? He seemed no worse . He behaved as though nothing had happened . There was no guilty look in his eyes and no apprehension . He made no apology . Lunch passed , teatime and the day . I finished my work and went into the kitchen . " Tell me , " I said , " about last night . " Thompson was peeling potatoes . He used to do this into a bucket on the floor , as if he were peeling for a whole crew . He put down the clasp-knife and stood up . He looked worried . " That was a terrible thing , " Thompson said , as if it was something he had read about in the papers . " Terrible , sir . A young lady like that , sir . To come over here for me , an educated lady like that . Someone oughter teach her a lesson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was took clean off my guard . " It was n't right , " said Thompson . " Whichever way you look at it , it was n't right . I told her she 'd messed me up . " " I 'm not blaming you . I want to know . " " And she waited till you was out , " Thompson said . " That 's not straight . She may class herself as an educated young lady , but do you know what I reckon she is ? I reckon she 's a jane . " I went down to the bungalow . I was beginning to laugh now . She was in the garden digging . Her sleeves were rolled up and she was sweating over the fork . The beds were thick with leaves and dead plants . I stood there watching her . She looked at me nervously for a moment . " I 'm making the garden tidy , " she said . " For Monday . When the bitch comes down . " She was shy and awkward . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the house . It was the last I ever saw of her . When I came back , the fork she had been using was stuck in the flower bed where she had left it , She went to London that night and did not return . " Thank Gawd , " Thompson said . PrHERE was a change in Thompson 1 after this and there was a change in me . Perhaps the change came because the dirty February days were going , the air softer and the year moving . I was leaving soon . Thompson mentioned temptation no more . Now he went out every day . The postman was his friend . They used to go to the pub . He asked for his money . In the public house the laborers sat around muttering in a language Thompson did n't understand . He stood them drinks . At his first pint he would start singing . They encouraged him . He stood them more drinks . The postman ordered them for him and then tapped him on the pocket book . They emptied his pockets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me about him after they had emptied his pockets . Thompson came back across the common alone , wild , enthusiastic and moaning with suspicion by turns . The next day he would have a mood . All the countryside for ten miles around knew the sailor . He became famous . Our last week came . He quieted down . " What are you going to do ? " I asked . " I 'll stay by you . " " You ca n't , " I said . " I 'll be going abroad . " " You need n't pay me , " he said . " I 'll stay by you . " It was hard to make him understand he could not stay with me . He was depressed . " Get me out of here safe , " he pleaded at last . " Come with me to the station . " He could not go on his own because all the people he knew would be after him . He had told them he was going . He had told them I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They would come creeping out of cottage doors and ditches for him . S o I PACKED his things and got a taxi to call for us . How slowly we had lived and moved in these fields and lanes . Now we broke through it all with a rush as the car dropped down the hill and the air blew in at the window . As we passed the bungalow with the sun on its empty windows I saw the fork standing in the neglected bed . Then we swept on . Thompson sat back in the car so that no oneshould see him , but I leaned forward to see everything for the last time and forget it . We got to the town . As the taxi slowed down in the streets people looked out of shops , doors , a potman nodded from the pub . " Watcha , Jack , " the voices called . The police , the fishmonger , boys going to school , dozens of people waved to him . I might have been riding with royalty . At the station a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and gave a shout . " Hi , jackor she called , bending double , went into shrieks of laughter and called across to a friend at a first floor window . It was a triumph . But Thompson ignored them all . He sat back out of sight . " Thank Gawd I 've got you , " he said . " They skin you of everything . " We sat in the train . It was a two-hour journey . " Once I strike Whitechapel , " he said in the voice of one naming Singapore , " I 'll be O.K. " He said this several times , averting his face from the passing horror of the green fields . " Do n't you worry , " he said . " Do n't fret yourself for me . Do n't you worry . " His optimism increased as mine dwindled as we got nearer London . By the time we reached London he was almost shouting . " I 'll fall on my feet , do n't you worry . I 'll send you my address . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk off into the yellow rain and the clogged , grunting and mewing traffic . He stepped right into it without looking . Taxis braked to avoid him . He was going to walk to Whitechapel . He reckoned it was safer .
