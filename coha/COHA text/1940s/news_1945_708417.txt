txt ALBANY BILL ASKS FARE RISE TO MAKE THE SUBWAYS PAY Measure Requiring Acceptance by City Would Put the Lines Under Transit Authority RATE MIGHT BE 10 CENTS Legislation Has Bipartisan Up-State Sponsorship and Backing of Windels The committee 's statement on transit fare , Page 33 . By CLAYTON KNOWLES Special to THE NEW YORK TIMES . ALBANY , Feb. ** fight to end the 5-cent fare on the New York City subways , a perennial proposal before the Legislature , will come to the fore again Monday night with introduction of a bill to create a City Transit Authority with power to charge a fare adequate to put the system on a self-sustaining basis , provide improved and safer service and allow for modernization of the older lines . The bill will be offered by Senator Richard P. Byrne , Democrat , of Syracuse , and Assemblyman D. Mallory Stephens , Republican , of Brewster , but it is no secret that it was drafted by the Citizens Transit Committee . Even before introduction of the bill , which can not become operative without adoption of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman of the transit committee , issued a statement supporting it . He declared that it represented " the first step " in a program of gradually extricating the operation of the publicly owned transportation system of New York City from political control and establishing it on a sound non-political basis . " Deficit Seen at $70,000,000 Without such Immediate remedial action , he said , the city faced an annual operating deficit on the system of $65,000,000 to $70,000 , - 000 within two years after the war . He also asked the Legislature to order an " immediate investigation by the Public Service Commission " and " an early , frank and public report concerning the physical and financial condition of the subways and the public health and safety factors involved in the service now provided . " He asserted that such an investigation was necessary because the public no longer had the protection of State supervision and inspection of the subways , a function which was dropped when the city took over the consolidated system in 1940 . The Byrne-Stephens bill would set up a three-man Authority , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotating terms , to replace the Board of Transportation in running the city transit system . The Authority would have broad powers for extension , modernization and general improvement of the system . To achieve the over-all improvement of the system , the bill specifically grants to the Authority power to increase the fare up to 10 cents . " Fare Provisions of Bid On this point , the bill reads : " Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary , the Authority shall have the power and it shall be its duty to charge and collect a fare for the use of such facilities not to exceed ten cents per passenger , which fare shall be adequate , when included with all ether income , to provide the AuLhority with revenues sufficient to pay the full cost of management , 3peration and proper maintenance 3f such facilities , the interest and amortization on all debt heretofore n ? hereafter incurred by the city or the construction or acquisition 3f such facilities , and the estabishment of an adequate fund for : he complete modernization and reiabilitation of such facilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars as are antiquated or inadequate , and such income shall be used exclusively for such purposes . " The bill further empowers the Authority to provide for the issuance of transfers on all lines under city operation and to enter into agreements with privately owned transit corporation for similar free transfers . While the bill is permissive in nature and requires action by the city government before it can become effective , its fate before the Legislature is extremely dubious . Up-State legislators have in the past voted on similar legislation in accordance with the wishes of New York City representatives . Members from New York City have voted as a rule against anything which would jeopardize the fivecent fare . New York City members , who believe a fare increase justified on the basis of sound economy , have been influenced in their voting , it is generally conceded , by the fact that the problem ' has become " a political football . " The argument has been put forth that the 5-cent fare is a sort of city subsidy which helps the city maintain its pre-eminent position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the city , by action of its own legislative bodies with the concurrence of the Mayor , ? ow has the power to increase the fare . In view of this , it is contended by some . there is no reason why the matter should be brought to Albany each year . Up-State legislators are only too ready to agree that local action would be more appropriate . Mr. Windels in supporting the new bill stressed that it was permissive and that it provided that afditional revenue from an increased fare be used only for subway purposes . " It must not be possible for city officials to divert it into the general fund to be used for general city purposes as was done with the sales tax , " he stated . Concerning the need for an increased fare , Mr. Windels declared that the " rosy promises of reduced deficits and improved service " made when the city took over the IRT and BMT in 1940 , have been replaced by " an enormous increase in the annual deficit and a shocking decline in the service . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " has climbed from $29,000,000 per annum in 1940 to $41,000,000 per annum in 1944 , to say nothing of the loss of taxes and rentals formerly paid to the city by the private companies when they were operating the subway . " The city transportation system is now short 7,300 employes . These places must be filled when the war is over . This will add at least another $15,000,000 to the present cost of operation and increase the present deficit by that amount . " In addition , we now have a wartime increase of traffic revenue amounting to approximately $10,000,000 a year and when traffic returns to pre-war normal the resulting decline in traffic income will add still another $10,000,000 to the deficit . " I He asserted that without a selfsustaining fare " we shall , within two years after the war , face an annual deficit of between $65,000 , - 000 and $70,000,000 in subway operations . " Mr. Windels added that , with the extra fare , modernization of the older lines could be undertaken , with installation of " decent , properly illuminated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and rebuilding of stations " with adequate entrances and exits and escalators substituted for stairs wherever possible . " The improvements , he said , would provide for the construction industry 10,000 post-war jobs which would last for years .
