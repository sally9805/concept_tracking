TIME 'S London bureau chief , John Osborne , spent much of the last month touring industrial England . He talked to factory workers and their bosses in Manchester and in Birmingham , clerks and businessmen in Liverpool , shipyard workers of the Merseyside , miners in Newcastle . He reported : <P> This is still a good country . A month in the Britain outside London is enough to convince anybody that there is a lot of vigor and promise left in the people who live the real life of this island and who do its real work . The alien traveler returns to London with a sad feeling that all these confident , energetic , likable Britons whom he has just met do n't know what has hit them . But their strength has always been that they never know when they are down , * and maybe that matters more than anything else . <P> One thing that matters gravely is whether Britons are going to keep their country free for free men . I am not so sure they are as I once was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But you also find the creeping , dangerous illusion that freedom consists of equality at any price . The determination that nobody shall have an advantage over anybody else is taking on a morbid and destructive quality that may in the long run be more disastrous than all the country 's other troubles . <P> The queue spirit is extending into every phase of British life . Sports , food , clothing , politics , the Government 's efforts in the economic crisis are all affected by the popular insistence that if anyone is to be miserable , everyone must be equally miserable . In a country where inequality has been and still is crass and pronounced , this is perhaps a natural tendency . But it is nonetheless inhibiting to national and individual effort , and it is already justifying and concealing innumerable small invasions of personal freedom . Britons have given up most of their economic freedoms and seem intent on abandoning the remainder as soon as they can . So far , they imagine that this will not mean the final loss of individual freedom . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is too late ' . <P> " They Do n't Give Us a Lead . " It is often said that Britons have never cared much about their Empire , and do not now . They do care , and they simply do n't believe it when they read that they are losing the Empire . They do n't mean the technical empire of India , Burma , the Colonies . By " empire " they mean South Africa , Australia , New Zealand and Canada-the Commonwealth . That is the " empire " that matters to them , and a good many of them see Britain 's future in it . Some of them even think they can somehow transfer much of their home island 's population , energy and talents to the Dominions without diminishing the great collective entity which they think of as " Britain and the Empire . " The world might get a jolt if they were right . But most of them still think of Britain as their natural home , and look with scorn on the minority , noisiest in London , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "
