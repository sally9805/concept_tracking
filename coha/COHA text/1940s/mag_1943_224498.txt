The creator of the war 's most shocking book published it herself . A collection of 62 8 by 1 1 photographs , Europe 's Children was rejected by ten U.S. publishers before Photographer Therese Bonney brought it out herself , with no imprint beyond the cryptic message : Limited autographed edition $3 . Send your check to National City Bank , 32nd Street Branch , 1 Park Avenue , New York , N.Y . account No. 123 . By word of mouth and an occasional unillustrated review , the fame of Europe 's Children spread so fast that its edition of 2,000 was quickly exhausted . <P> Last week orders were pouring into Account No. 123 at the rate of 50 a day , with no books available . Duell , Sloane &; Pearce was preparing to publish a commercial edition this month . <P> What makes Europe 's Children a moving study is that its unposed photographs of children among the ruins are not primarily atrocity pictures , although there are a few ghastly studies of starvation . <P> These superb photographs of children are different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world is in ruins and over them the stricken faces of their parents leave their imperishable imprints on child minds . Some of the childish faces are drowsy , dying of fatigue . Some of them are incredibly beautiful , the maturity and purpose on their pondering faces giving to the photographs the wild quality of early Christian art . <P> Also devoted to the plight of Europe 's children is They Shall Inherit the Earth , by Czech Novelist and Playwright Otto Zoff ( John Day ; $3 ) . It is written from the relief workers ' point of view , with an enthusiastic foreword by Dorothy Canfield Fisher ; its greatest lack is the statistics that would give substance to its disconnected case histories and its well-intentioned but sketchy stories of distress among the 100,000,000 children of the Axis-occupied countries . Most shocking question it raises : When Europe 's uprooted children grow up , what will they do to a world which has done such things to them ?                  @ @ @
