txt When the President travels in time of war , it is a major military maneuver . TI1P most vivid impression of accompanying the Commander in Chief across a nation in arms is that of ubiquitous troops ? not masses of troops , not parade-ground display , not time-wasting salutes , but the never-ending presence of the soldier on guard . Not once during the hundreds of miles we have ridden since leaving Washington has this train been out of the sight or range of alert lArmy forces . It is a mysterious thrill in the career of e ' . ery soldier who knows he has a vital task to perform but is never exactly sure what it is . He could be policing the route of the Secretary of War : he could Le guarding a Congressional im estigating committee ; he . could be protecting Gen. George C. Marshall or even President Roosevelt hiioself . He knows by now that it was the President  --  and he already has written home about it  --  but at the time he could n't be . sure even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the antiaircraft guns to be pointed . Result of Long Planning For the Secret Service of the United States who directed it , and for the Army commanders who executed it , this continuous , omnipresent protection is an achievement of long planning and cheerful co-ordination . Thosands of men over many hundreds of miles were brought into an unbroken network of policing duty . There was no hitch , no visible false move at any time , and no occasion for a gun to go oft . For my part , I never tried dashing on to the train to teat the defenses . At all times they looked as though they meant business . Now when President Roosevelt gets ready to take one of his excursions out of the Capital and , one might say , into America , even the movements of the accompanying correspondents have to be sly and surreptitious . We were summoned to the White House one morning and were told by Press Secretary Stephen T. Early that a trip with the President was available to us and that , in his judgment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inform even our editors the nature of the trip , its direction , its purpose , its duration , time of leaving , or that it was a Presidential trip . It had to be approved on faith . Our editors might guess and guess rightly . ( They probably did : they are bright like that . ) But they could n't be unqualifiedly certain , We were just going to vanish one day , Nothing would be heard from us ? please , no applause  --  for an unspecified time and our home offices could neither write nor telegraph to us on the train , this in order to preserve maximum secrecy as to its place at any time and its itinerary . We vanished with the greatest of ease . We had been requested to keep ourselves free of assignment on the day of appointed departure and particularly were instructed not to get ourselves tied up trying to cover President Roosevelt 's Jefferson Day address , for he planned to leave shortly after making that speech . For ourselves , we were given a mid-morning rendezvous in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baggage and sent us In two cars to an outlying suburban station . And our bags  --  and later the photographers ? came along separately . There was no long line of official cars to attract attention . We were allowed to board an innocent-looking train which was waiting for us on an inconspicuous side track . It picked up no commuters on its way to Washington . President Goes Aboard Sometime in the course of the next hour and somewhere  --  not at Union Station and not at any point visible to so much as one bystander , the President had boarded his special car and his aides an adjoining Pullman , We knew that , before we had gone many miles , the train , starting with seven cars , had quietly become nine . For proper reasons of security it is not permitted to describe the special wartime car the Commander In Chief uses , but it Can be said that when it has been hooked up to the train and the engine begins to pull out , the engineer knows that something has been added . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which could be precipitated by anyone who would rather see Hitler win the war than the United Nations . Painstaking precautions are taken to keep the course of the President 's travels unknown and necessary information restricted to as few persons af possible . Not many on the train tcnow even the scheduled stops for the next day Correspondents and photographers are told only a little time ahead when to be ready to get off . Nr more than a handful of Army officers meet the President to escort him to the training stations . A dozen or more Vet little towns will not know who has been in its midst until several days later . Well , not many will know it . But some . The news does get out and while I hesitate to point the accusing finger , the fact is that there is one distinguished and well-known passenger on the train who appears to take the need of secrecy very casually indeed . He is off at every station and every operational stop . He says next to nothing but he invariably gives a knowing look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealing wag to that little Scotty tail of his . There always are some who recognize Fala , and when Fala has I landed . the President can not he far behind . R.
