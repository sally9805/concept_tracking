Norman John Oswald Makin had come a long way . Last week the errand boy from Broken Hill , who entered Australian politics at 19 , was host at a dinner for his fellow UNO leaders at the swank Savoy in London . Russia 's terrifying Vishinsky was gaily talkative on his right , and China 's Wellington Koo suavely quiet on his left . <P> Norman Makin is a teetotaling Methodist lay preacher at home but he gave his guests wine and brandy while drinking orange juice himself . All week Norman Makin , chairman of the Security Council of the United Nations Organization , was a busy , genial host . Even so , he had an uneasy time of it . <P> There was that letter ( addressed fraternally to " Dear N. Makin " ) from old-time Bolshevik Dmitry Manuilsky , who as chairman of the Ukrainian delegation* ran the Russian show until Vishinsky finally arrived from his lengthy briefing by Stalin and Molotov . The letter asked Makin for a UNO probe of British activities in Indonesia . In the same delivery came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambassador to the U.S. and Russian member of UNO 's Assembly . With Iran 's appeal against Russian interference in Azerbaijan already on the Council docket , Makin was suddenly in the center of open disputes openly arrived at . <P> Earlier in the week Eleanor Roosevelt had pleaded for frankness among the delegates ; before the week was out their candor could be cut with a knife . Catastrophe did not result from plain speaking ; issues everyone had dreaded were not so dreadful after all . UNO was going noisily but well . <P> Scrapping . The Security Council meets in Church House just behind Westminster Abbey . There the test came last week when Britain 's Ernie Bevin rose ponderously from his se.at near Vishinsky . Bevin , looking straight ahead , said : " I think it would be a great mistake if any country could not have its complaint heard . " Everyone in the room snapped to attention . Vishinsky was a picture of pallid , intense concern . Bevin warmed up throatily on Greece ( which Russia had brought up to counteract talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Foreign Office , leaned forward and tried in vain to calm him . But Bevin ploughed on : " I am so tired of these charges by the Soviet Government in private assembly that no one will be happier than I to see that they are brought out into the open . " As he does when really worked up , Ernie Bevin put his glasses back on and took them off again . " If there is a complaint by the Iranian Government against the Soviet Government , I believe that peace depends on bringing these facts out before the world , whether they are right or whether they are wrong . " <P> Spitting . It was then Vishinsky 's turn to get up and talk . Famed as the tigerish prosecutor of the Moscow treason trials ( TIME , Aug. 31 , 1936 ) , Vishinsky was badly handicapped last week by having to stop every two minutes to be trans lated . His tall young interpreter , Vladimir Postoyev , became more &; more agonized trying to translate Vishinsky 's Soviet hairsplitting . When the agonized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spat something at him , grimly watched the luckless linguist jump as though he had been shot .
