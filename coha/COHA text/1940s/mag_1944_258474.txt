Mann 's Translator <P> Sirs : <P> I am writing to you because , unfortunately , I do not know the address of the gentleman who came to see me a short time ago , and with whom I had a pleasant conversation , to be used , I presume , as material for a story in your esteemed magazine TIME July 3 . On that occasion , I became guilty of a forgetfulness which I want to correct with this letter . <P> It is my wish to take the opportunity to prove my gratefulness to my translator of many years , Mrs. Helen Lowe-Porter in Princeton , for her extraordinary achievement she has accomplished with the translation of all my books , from Buddenbrooks 1924 up to the last volume of the Joseph series . I am fully aware of the tremendous difficulties which my not exactly simple way of writing puts in the way of her mediatorial zeal and faithfulness , and I can not appreciate enough the great credit Mrs. Lowe-Porter has earned with her linguistic reproduction of my work for the English-speaking public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that is why I wish to express my appreciation publicly . My literary standing in this country and in Great Britain would certainly not be what , gratifyingly , it is , if I had not had the good fortune of finding a translator of the devotion and linguistic talent of Mrs. Helen Lowe-Porter . . . . <P> <P> THOMAS MANN <P> Pacific Palisades , Calif . <P> H. T. Lowe-Porter , ne Helen Tracy Porter , 68 , is a native Pennsylvanian . <P> A graduate of Wells College in Aurora , N.Y. , she has lived most of her life abroad . <P> Mann sends his manuscripts piecemeal to his translator , who works on them almost as hard ( eight hours a day ) as their author does . Mrs. Lowe bakes her own bread ( see cut ) , keeps house for her husband , Dr Elias Avery Lowe , an Oxford paleographer , who joined the staff of Princeton 's Institute for Advanced Study in 1936 . Her hyphenated surname is the result of her mistaken notion that married Britons always join surnames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Maine coast , translating Mann 's current work-in-progress. - ED . <P> <P> War for Fair Play <P> Sirs : <P> You are saddened by our war losses and you say : " World War II is not yet a crusade " TIME , ' June 26 . As the late Prof. Boas pointed out , it is almost impossible to tell what masses of people have thought in the past or are thinking in the present . For each one of us , it is mostly a projection of individual thought . So , for the American soldier this war may not be a crusade , but something better on a lower emotional plane : a fight for fair play . <P> My father was a Russian Jew who loved this country because it gave him a chance to live like a decent human " being . I was blessed with a mother who knew no boundaries of race or religion , especially when other people were in trouble . My grammar-school and high-school teachers taught me to love good sportsmanship . They taught what they were , even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war came I went over to France as a machine gunner with that same 4th Division which is now fighting at Montebourg . We did not talk about slogans then and our men probably do n't talk about them now . We thought we knew what we were fighting for , although it was hard to hold onto beliefs when boys we loved were killed before our eyes .
