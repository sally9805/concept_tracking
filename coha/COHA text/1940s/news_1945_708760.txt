txt Letters to The Times Plan for Veterans Evolved New Jersey County Physicians Propose an Approved System TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Recently there appeared in THE TIMES a letter from an ex-service man on the subject of the medical care of veterans . The writer suggested that veterans be permitted to obtain medical care from their own physicians , and hospitalization in the existing hospitals in their own communities . This appears at first to be such a logical and simple plan that one wonders why it has not been followed by the Veterans Administration all along . On further study certain administrative obstacles appear which have made it difficult to put in effect . At present , however , there is being established a plan which incorporates almost precisely the suggestions , made by your correspondent , and which has , we believe , overcome the difficulties previously encountered . Some months ago the Monmouth County ( N. J. ) Medical Society was asked to cooperate in making plans for the returning veterans . A committee was appointed and was named to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After some study a plan was endorsed by the service committee and presented to the manager and the chief medical officer of the Veterans Administration facility at Lyons , N. J. Those officials were quite enthusiastic about it and have obtained the approval of the medical authorities of the Veterans Administration in Washington . Medical Society Involved The Monmouth County plan is , briefly , as follows : All members of the Monmouth County Medical Society who are willing to serve will be designated as out-patient physicians on a fee basis for the Veterans Administration  --  this will be approximately 90 per cent of our membership . The society will supervise the work to make sure that the veterans are given proper care . In addition , at convenient places in the county , at such intervals as the volume of work requires , there will be screening clinics . These will be staffed by specialists in several fields ? internal medicine , general surgery , orthopedic surgery , eye , ear , nose and throat , psychiatry , etc . To these clinics the returning veteran may come , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the basis of this record and their own findings the clinic staff will determine whether the veteran needs treatment and whether such treatment can be carried out at home or requires hospitalization . If he can be treated on an out-patient basis , he will be shown a list of physicians qualified to treat his particular condition , from which he makes his choice . If he has no choice , he will be assigned to a physician convenient to his home . The Veterans Administration will provide the necessary clerical work and will also provide a liaison officer to authorize the referral . Individuality Preserved Plans are also being made to permit hospitalization of the veterans in local general or specialized hospitals . It should be stated that this had already been proposed by the Veterans Administration before the medical society suggested it . The Monmouth . County plan preserves the individual doctor-patient relationship and avoids the psychologically bad situation of being treated by a " Government doctor " in whose selection the patient has no part . It also will obviate the hardship of traveling ' long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on the principle that before he was a soldier a man was a citizen , and that as a veteran he has certainly lost none of the rights of a citizen . Our Monmouth County plan , it seems to us , preserves intact one of those rights , and if it adds something to the medical service rendered to the non-veteran citizen , it is little enough for us to do for those who have fought our wars for us .

Special Cars Criticized TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORE TIMES : Your editorial of June 29 " Vacation Time  --  For Soldiers " commented upon the contrast between the old , battered coaches in which our soldiers returning from Europe " get home somehow * * * eventually " and the " Pullmans and modern coaches and streamliner trains * * with few uniforms , few combat ribbons , few Purple Hearts " in their reserved space . This contrast is evident to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a starter toward correctini , this situation , which does none of us credit , I suggest the New York Central take off the special car on the rear of Train No 241 , leaving Grand Central at 5:33 P. M. every weekday except Saturday for Croton  --  Tarrytown first stop . Seats in this car are available only at a price and are occupied by cornmuters  --  men and women  --  who obviously do not care to ride in even such excellent coaches as comprise the balance of this train . This special car could , just as well be carrying soldiers , and they would look a lot better in it than the present passengers . CHARLES H. ROE . Tarrytown , N. Y. , July 2 , 1945 . Plea for Animals During Summer TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : To people who are leaving the city for a vacation , as people do even in wartime , the New York Women 's League for Animals wishes to say : Please provide for the family cat and dog while you are gone ; do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That too many are doing this is evident from the number of strays that are brought to the Ellin Prince Sp. : , - 010 Hospital with the explanation by the rescuer , " I found it thrown out on the street . " Other abandoned animals are never rescued , but remain in the alleys a prey to starvation , accident and disease . If posz:ble , take your pet with you into the country ; they enjoy an outing as much as you do , and with little pains can generally be taught the amenities of travel . If you ca n't do this and have no friend who will undertake the care of the animal , commit it to one of the several humane societies that stand ready in New York to save cats and dogs from neglect .

Strikes Arouse Resentment Disregard of Public Opinion Viewed as Dangerous to Labor TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do to prevent a recurrence of a situation wherein a labor union , in the face of a governmental ruling and with utter disregard of labor 's no-strike pledge , deprived the people of this city of their daily news . It seems to me the newspapers themselves are the ones best suited to answer this question . The tremendous power which labor wields today is in no small measure a result of the attitude of employers toward their employes in years gone by . In those days bosses boasted of the low wages they paid . When Henry Ford adopted a minimum wage of $5 a day , employers screamed to high heaven that he was ruining industry . In other words , a generation ago the pendulum had swung so far on the side of employers that capital was in a position to exploit labor . Today the exact reverse is true . Labor leaders have ' been given the power to exploit capital and they certainly are doing a thorough job , with no regard at all for the inconveniences caused the public . How can these men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pendulum always swings back , and that the farther it goes in one direction , the farther it swings the other way ? It seems to me it should be the function of government to keep that old pendulum swinging in as small an arc as possible . Labor leaders do not seem to realize that in the long run public opinion controls , and that because they are antagonizing the public more and more every day they are fast losing the ground they have gained with so much difficulty over the many years . I suggest that these men give thought to the danger presented to our form of democracy by the several strongly organized pressure groups , each seeking to further its own selfish interests at the expense of the public . Some day the women of this country , out of self-protection , will form an organization of consumers which will make other pressure groups , such as farmer , labor and business , look like so many pikers .

Planting Only Part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a tree man who had quite a bit to do with selecting and planting the trees in the East River Park , along the East River Drive and on varioul city streets , I read with a good deal of interest the letter from Edward A. Connell in your issue of June 22 . I took particular notice of the lass sentence , which reads : " Arborists ar ( hoping , however , that if New Yoti enlarges its tree-planting program i ( will not make the too common mistake of failing to appropriate sufficienf funds for proper maintenance . " I too hope that New York will not fail to provide the means for adequate care and maintenance of its trees . The record of this city in that respect is not of the best . In saying this , no one for a moment wishes to minimize the accomplishments of our Park Department . In the last ten or twelve years they have done a tremendous amount of fine constructive work in tree planting and in other improvements along the city highways , in parks and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that line by any other large city . But to construct something is only half an accomplishment as far as real and lasting benefit to the people is concerned . Upkeep and maintenance is the other half . Having done as well as we in New York have done , as park and highway builders and tree planters , we have no cause to shrink from the recognition of our mistake . PAUL ROBIN .

Rent Ruling Held Unjust TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In connection with the recent ? ruling on rents of so-called luxury apartments it is not clear whether the court took into consideration the number of rooms involved . This is an important factor in arrives ing at a just rental . A rental of $100 a month for a six-room apartment may not be looked upon as " luxury . " There . is probably more luxury attached to a $90 rental for a one-room apartment . Since the court 's ruling is based upon luxury , it is obvious that the ruling will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , July 3 , 1945.
