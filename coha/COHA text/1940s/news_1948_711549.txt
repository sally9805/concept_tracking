txt Gov . Thomas E. Dewey of New York , the Republican candidate for President , announced today his full endorsement of the measures being taken by American representatives in Paris in collaboration with the British and French to achieve a peaceful solution of the Berlin crisis . In a statement issued here before he started on the second leg of his campaign trip to win the electoral votes of the Pacific Coast and Mountain States , Mr. Dewey called upon all Americans to join with the people of other lands who share American aims in prayers for peace and ' in support of the steps being taken in Paris . Mr. Dewey has been in daily touch with developments in the Berlin crisis through John Foster Dulles , his principal adviser on foreign relations , since the ? start of his campaign trip last Sunday ; Allen W. Dulles , president : ? of ? : the Council of Foreign Relations and brother of John Foster Dulles , is accompanying . Mr : Dewey on the trip and has talked with his brother by transatlantic telephone at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's statement on the Berlin crisis today said : ' In the hearts of every one of us today there is a fervent prayer for peace . In that prayer we are joined by millions of men and women in many lands who are at one with us in a great unity of aspiration for a peaceful world in . which freedom will be secure and in which right and justice can live and grow in strength . " Three years ago history 's most shattering war ended . The hope of peace-loving people and peaceseeing nations turned to the great conference held here in San Francisco for the building of an organization to bring order into world society , through which mankind 's desire for peace could be mobilized into an effective , irresistible moral force . " The years that have passed since then have been a period of disappointment and frustration . Events have moved toward a grave crisis in Berlin . Today the eyes of the world are on Paris , where our American delegation to the United Nations , together with the representatives of other free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a peaceful- settlement . That delegation is bipartisan and represents a united America . " This is too sober a moment in our history for threats or recrimination . It is a time instead for a great and solemn reassertion of what we believe , what we hope for and what we will endeavor , against whatever odds and difficulties , to achieve . " I call upon our own people and men and women of every land who share our aims to unite our prayers for peace , to make it clear beyond misunderstanding that we stand together to strengthen the hands of those who speak and work for us and for the cause of peace in Paris ; that our faith in that cause is undiminished ; that now , when so much we cherish seems to hang in a precarious balance , the moral resources of mankind are still unwaveringly enlisted to bring to pass a lasting peace founded upon decency and justice and fair dealing among men and nations .

He and his advisers are convinced that he lost no strength during the ' trip and is continuing to hold a substantial lead that he nad before it started . They do not go so far as to claim that any new ground was gained . The crowds that turned out to hear him last week as he visited Illinois , Iowa , Colorado , New Mexico and Arizona and California were less numerous and demonstrative than those that greeted him in 1944 , but Mr. Dewey and his political- advisers are said to regard this as a good omen rather than a bad one . They recall that Mr. Dewey attracted much larger crowds in his campaign for Governor in 1938 , when he lost , than he did in 1942 and 1946 , when he won . This year , Mr. Dewey 's advisers maintain more voters have already decided how they will vote than was the case in 1944 . They believe further that a substantial majority has decided to vote Republican .

It was in Oregon that his victory in the Republican preferential primary went a long way toward winning him this year 's nomination for President .
