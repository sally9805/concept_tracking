In Washington last summer , before a House Labor subcommittee , James Caesar Petrillo was asked if he thought that Thomas A. Edison had done a disservice to humanity by inventing the phonograph . " Not to humanity , " piped Petrillo , " but to musicians . " <P> Last week Caesar Petrillo , whose power over U.S. musicians extends from Toscanini to Harry James , decided that it was time to call a halt on the progress of Edison 's handiwork . He ordered the 216,000 members of his American Federation of Musicians to stop making all recordings and radio transcriptions after Dec. 31 . He was playing a familiar tune . He had once cracked : " What do I care about science ; my boys got ta eat . " But this time Caesar Petrillo brought his tune to a crashing crescendo . Said he : " We stop making recordings once and for all-period . " <P> Instruments of Destruction . Czar Petrillo 's aim as a union leader was understandable : he wants to keep his union big and his income fat. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only because he has been able to keep it heavily featherbedded . Of the 216,000 members , only about 35,000 are full-time professionals ; about twice as many are part-timers who , says Petrillo , " are not quite making a living at it . " But more than half are onetime musicians who , like Petrillo , have put aside their instruments and make their living in other occupations . <P> Instruments of Law . In his long fight against ' canned music , Petrillo has managed some lucrative compromises with technological progress . Five years ago he called a ban on recording , kept it on tight for 27 months , eventually won a settlement under which the recording companies paid A.F.M. a royalty on every disc they made . Last year the royalties amounted to about $2,000,000 ( every cent of it went to unemployed musicians , says Petrillo ) . <P> But in recent months things have not been going so smoothly . The Taft-Hartley Act , in a section aimed directly at Petrillo , banned payment of record royalties to a union . The Lea Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broadcasting studios ( forcing them , among other things , to hire stand-by musicians ) , had passed its first test in the Supreme Court . Last week in Chicago , a charge of violating the act was filed against Caesar ; if convicted , he could be sent to jail for a year . <P> So Petrillo has been searching his nimble brain to find new ways to make radio programs , records and juke boxes play cash-jingling tunes on his union till . His edict against recording did not sound like a true pitch to the broadcasting and recording companies . It sounded more like bargaining bluster . His Dec. 31 deadline coincides with contract renewal time for the record ' makers . <P> Instruments of Business . This time the little Czar 's antagonists had seen him coming . The $250,000,000-a-year recording industry has been working overtime in recent weeks to pile up backlogs ; there were trade estimates that some companies had built up a supply of unissued records for two or three years , that at least a year 's supply of new popular tunes was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to prevent repressing from old master records .
