When Wendell Willkie arrived by plane in England one day this week , the country was enjoying comparative quiet . A transport had shuttled him from Lisbon to a western England airport . As the plane came down , Mr. Willkie was impatiently striding up &; down the aisle ; the bump of the landing threw Mr. Willkie flat . Back on his feet and brushed off , he burst out of the cabin door . " I never felt better in my life , " he exclaimed . To reporters who knew who he was but wanted to know what he was , he said , " I am just Wendell Willkie , " and hopped off to London by another plane . <P> To awestruck newsmen in London , who noted his rumpled suit , his rumpled hair , his Willkie campaign necktie-a blue four-in-hand with white stripes spelling his name-he declared : " I have nothing to say except that I have had a fine passage over and that I am here . " In Lisbon he had made it as plain as he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one matter : " The objective of giving full aid to Great Britain finds myself in full accord with President Roosevelt . " First of the many Britons whom he questioned was the chambermaid who served him early morning tea in his hotel room . " How 's the war going ? " Mr. Willkie asked . Said she : " Of course we 're going to win but I think we 'd like a little more help from America . " To the waiter at breakfast he shot the same question , got much the same answer . <P> Off went energetic Mr. Willkie for a quick tour of the devastated district around St. Paul 's , a call on Foreign Minister Anthony Eden , lunch at No. 10 Downing Street with Winston Churchill . Two hours later he emerged . " I knew he was a great man , " said Mr. Willkie . " I know it now even more . " Although the British press had been-as far as was deemed politic-all for Roosevelt 's reelection , a shaken London paper murmured : " Willkie is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has appeared in American public life since the other Roosevelt withdrew from it nearly 30 years ago . "
