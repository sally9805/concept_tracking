For two days last week the chances for peace in Palestine looked good . The Jews had won their immediate objective-an Egyptian offer to cease fire and talk armistice terms . They quickly accepted . But at week 's end the odds in favor of peace were off again . <P> The Israeli military campaign had been a brilliant , hard-won success , highlighted by a fast three-day invasion of Egypt . Driving down the Egyptian right flank ( after a feint at Gaza on the coast ) , the Israeli forces plunged headlong into Egypt and fought their way to El Arish , over 50 miles behind the frontier . <P> Everywhere they took the Egyptians by surprise . Cried one captured Egyptian colonel : " But what about our forces at Beersheba ? " Israeli officers explained that they had captured Beersheba three months before , during the last Negeb campaign . At El Arish the Israelis severely damaged three enemy airfields and captured several Egyptian Spitfires , along with Egyptian soldiers and ammunition . Said Alouf+ Yigal Yadin ( 31 ) , chief of military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much damage as possible . It is not every day that we are in Egypt . The last time was 3,400 years ago . " <P> Lone Pocket . As the Israelis withdrew into Palestine , the Egyptians threw in the sponge . The two-week campaign , by Israeli claims , had cost the Egyptians 2,500 casualties ( including 700 prisoners ) and the loss of almost all their remaining toeholds in Palestine . Faluja , the one Egyptian pocket left within Israeli-held territory , had become a joke in Tel Aviv . Cracked cocky Israelis ( who were being pressed for higher taxes and war loan contributions ) : " We must turn the conduct of the war over to Finance Minister Kaplan-he knows how to empty pockets . " <P> At Lake Success , meanwhile , news of the Palestine cease-fire raised high hopes . Members of the U.N . Committee on Palestine , meeting briefly , agreed that Egyptian and Israeli representatives should meet with U.N . Mediator Ralph Bunche on the Island of Rhodes this week to hammer out the terms of a permanent armistice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happily into the unseasonal Long Island sunshine . <P> Five Planes . Their pleasure was shortlived . On the very day the Palestine ceasefire took effect , five British reconnaissance planes were shot down over Egypt by Israeli fighters and ground batteries . The planes , said the British , were operating from British bases in the Suez Canal Zone ; they were under orders to keep an eye on the movements of the Israeli army into Egypt . <P> Forthwith , Britain struck back . It instructed British aircraft to shoot down any Israeli planes encountered over Egyptian territory ; it dispatched British reinforcements to Transjordan to protect Aquaba , Transjordan 's port on the Red Sea and an important link in British communications to Bagdad . <P> The Israelis were impressed , but not intimidated . The British , they said , had no business flying reconnaissance over someone else 's war . Furthermore , three of the British planes had been shot down over Palestine , and they had the charred wreckage of one to prove it . The British troop landings at Aquaba , cried an official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israel 's territory in the southern part of the Negeb. "
