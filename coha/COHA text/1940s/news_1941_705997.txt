" Speaking before a crowd of more than 4,000 who attended a rally at Carnegie Hall under the auspices of the All-American Committee for the Re-election of La Guardia , the Mayor and the District Attorney bitterly assailed the Democratic opposition . They contended that the La Guardia administration constituted a government " of and by the people , " while the Democratic administration , if elected , would represent a " dictatorship of the political bosses . " ? " Back Room " Rule Feared Mr. Dewey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that if the opposition were elected the city would be run " not from City Hall , but from the clubhouse back rooms by the political leaders , the gangsters and the racketeers . " " Do you think the opposition philosophy is any better because some of them went to jail ? " he asked . " The boys rho were in the back rooms with those who went to jail are still around . And they want to get their feet back in the trough . " The District Attorney berated Governor Lehman and James A. Farley for their support of William O'Dwyer , Democratic Mayoralty candidate , and asked why they had not joined with the good government forces this year and in previous campaigns in an attempt to rid the city of " machine politics . " Citing the meeting , which was attended by naturalized American citizens and those descended from immigrants from foreign lands , as an example of the " American way of life , " Mr. Dewey declared that those present and hundreds of thousands of other voters have learned to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free government and dictatorship . " Political Machine Assailed Then , referring to the Democratic organization in the city , he continued : " Here in the city for 150 years there has been in exthtence a group of men , banded together in an organization of political nature , whose only purpose of existence is to hold New York City in its machine grasp . For the benefit of the people ? Oh , no ; for the benefit of the members of the machine , " He said that in previous adminiqtrations " justice was not handed out in the District Attorney 's office and not often in some of the courts , unless you had a friend who knew somebody who knew the right guy . " " Do you want to go back to that ? " he asked , as the crowd roared its disapproval . " There is only one issue in this campaign , " he said . " Whether you want to continue an administration whose integrity and ability is not questioned , or whether you want to return it to the boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been created in this city during the last eight years which is of the people and for the people all the time . This system is greater than // LA GUARDIA WARNS OF RULE BY ' BOSSES ' // any one man , and I know that Mayor La Guardia will be the first to admit this . For this is the new way of life in the City of New York . I know you will keep it . " Mayor Scores " Name-Calling " The Mayor in a short speech likewise said that the meeting " typified " his administration . Assailing his opponents for resorting to a campaign of villification and name-calling in a desperate attempt to svang over a lost campaign , the Mayor summed up the philosophy of his supporters as follows : " With songs on our lips and love in our hearts , we have no hatred , for we sincerely believe in the American way . We do n't get angry at the opposition ; we do not call ourselves names in order to create sympathy , and we do not seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American way and , incidentally , Americans are good sports . Good Americans do not cry and whine when they lose . We can give it out and we can take it too . " The Mayor declared that he deeply appreciated Mr. Dewey 's support in the campaign , and added that " when he talks about the opposition , believe me , he talks as an expert . " The Mayor asserted that he prided himself on the fact that during his entire administration there had not been " one penny 's worth of graft , one penny 's worth of scandal " connected with his administration . " We make no rash campaign promises , " he said . " We have a record of actual accomplishments of eight years . The only issue in this campaign can be summed up in one sentence : ' Do you want to continue a non-partisan , scientific and honest administration or do you want to turn the city back to Kelly , Flynn and Sullivan and the boys ? ' " Mayor Challenges Leaders In the afternoon Mayor La Guardia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flynn of the Bronx , Representative Christopher D. Sullivan of Manhattan and Frank V. Kelly of Brooklyn , issue a statement by this morning publicly giving their stand on the county reform propositions abolishing the offices of Sheriff and Register in the five boroughs . Speaking at a rally of 500 supporters at Brooklyn Palace , 130 Rockaway Avenue , Brooklyn , the Mayor assailed the three Democratic leaders for their failure to make any public statement on county reform during the campaign and contended that their silence ? " and the silence of their carboncopy candidates " ? could only be taken as a sign that they were more interested in keeping " jobholders and ward-heelers in office " than in promoting good government in the city . " I challenge their sincerity , their good faith and their honesty , and I demand that they declare them-1 selves on county reform no later than tomorrow morning , " the Mayor said . " I ask them to make a public statement , and permit their carbon-copy candidates to make public statements , favoring county reform . " Civil Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do before I became Mayor of the city . " The Mayor and Mr. O'Dwyer arrived at about the same time last night at the seventeenth annual dinner of the Hebrew Home and Hospital for the Aged at the Hotel Waldorf-Astoria .

Participating in a program sponsored by The Jewish Daily Forward at 11 A. M. , the Mayor asserted that his opponents had been unable to raise a single issue during the campaign and in a lastminute desperate attempt to win had resorted to a campaign of villification and abuse . Then , without specifically naming Governor Lehman , the Mayor continued : " Have you noticed that in the campaign of the opposition we do not hear any discussion of city affairs ? All we hear is abuse and name calling . My friends , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have always said that the politicians were a bunch of ' gonuvim ' ( crooks or thieves ) and now they are calling themselves names and saying , ' Oh , La Guardia Is calling us names , ' La Guardia uses bad language . ' " Mayor 's Version of Controversy The Mayor then gave his version of the heated exchange between himself and Governor Lehman and James A. Farley , which followed on the heels of a statement the Mayor had issued the night the Court of Appeals invalidated the State Controller race . " What happened is this : After the nomination a meraJaer of the American Labor party Joseph V. O'Leary ran for the office of Controller and the opposition attempted to get this member of the A. L. P. to repudiate his party and endorse the Tammany candidate for Mayor . That failed . ' " Then alter an opinion of the Attorney General saying that an election should be called followed the decision of the Court of Appeals that no election could be called . Then they began to explain and to apologize . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I said : ' Off dam goniff brent das hitel , ' which means , If the cap fits , wear it . ' " That is all there is to it and that 's the whole story . Now they are calling themselves names and saying I did it .
