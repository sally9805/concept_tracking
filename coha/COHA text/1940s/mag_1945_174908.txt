The U.S. has spent half again as much ( nearly $3 billion ) on radar as on atomic bombs . As a military threat , either in combination with atomic explosives or as a countermeasure , radar is probably as important as atomic power itself . And while the peacetime potentialities of atomic power are still only a hope , radar already is a vast going concern-a $2 billion-a-year industry , six times as big as the whole prewar radio business . <P> To fighting men , radar by now is as routine a war tool as a rifle , but it has rewritten the textbooks of warfare . It has also given man a sharp sixth sense which projects him into a world where almost any fantasy seems possible . <P> The Beam That Sees . An electronic supergadget which " sees " as well in the dark as in the light , radar projects a radio beam which , on striking an object near or far , returns an echo that is translated into a visual image on the radar screen . Radar can see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the explosion of a target , the fall of a hit plane . At sea , it can detect buoys , reefs and other ships more than 20 miles away . <P> From the air , by night or day or through the thickest cloud , it lays open the terrain below like a relief map , showing coastlines , ships , harbors , jetties , mountains , lakes , rivers , bridges , cities . At close range , with the narrowest radar beam , it is possible to see a city 's river fronts , avenues , even buildings . <P> Normally the screen shows the size but not the exact shape of the detected object . Occasionally it may get an effect of almost photographic sharpness ( the screen in Artzybasheff 's drawing , though an exaggerated animation , is based on a ' ' shadow effect " actually caught in one freakish radar picture of a plane a couple of hundred yards away ) . <P> Battle Results . Radar 's fantastic capabilities have been dramatized again &; again in battle . It was radar that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bart at Oran with one salvo from 26 miles away . German radar-directed fire sank the British battle cruiser Hood , and British radar in turn tracked down the Bismarck . It was a radar operator who gave the tragically ignored warning of approaching Japanese planes at Pearl Harbor . <P> Radar was chiefly responsible for defeating the U-boat and the buzz-bomb . The British say that radar and 300 R.A.F. pilots won the Battle of Britain . It was a vital aid to airmen and paratroopers over Normandy on cloudy Dday , and to the U.S. Navy in sinking the Japanese fleet . Radar opened the roof of Hitler 's Europe for the day- &-night,; all-weather body punching that crippled the Wehrmacht-and it lifted the Nipponese lid . <P> For all these uses and countless others , an amazing variety of radars have been developed . There are " early warning " radars which can pick up a plane more than 100 miles away and show how fast and in what direction it is flying ; fire-control radars which automatically aim and fire a machine gun or antiaircraft gun more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes for night fighter pilots , guide planes to blind landings ( called G.C.A. , " Ground-Controlled Approach " ) , observe stratospheric weather balloons and detect storms . Engineers think that it may even be possible some day to develop a missile that will guide itself to a target by radar .
