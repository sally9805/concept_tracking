Scorpion thought she should . His Majesty 's naval officers have n't a high regard for anyone 's wishes but their own , but I think these orders will settle the matter . " Captain Cunningham came around his desk , placed his hand affectionatelyon my shoulder , turned me toward the entrance of the marquee , and motioned Captain Soule to precede us . When Soule had gone out , Cunningham halted me . " Mr. Wiswell , " he said seriously , " a general 's orders are a general 's orders , and as such they command respect and obedience from any man in his army ; but as you 've seen , the navy 's a law to itself . I can see you 've set your heart on having these rebels of yours go safely off , but unless the proper precautions are taken , I fear they may have difficulty . " " I do n't follow you , " I said . " This order specifically instructs Cunningham tightened his grip on my shoulder . " I know , I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it , Wiswell : it 's better to be safe than to he sorry . The only safe way  --  I 'm sure you 'll understand me , Mr. Wiswell  --  is to have a private understanding with the two naval lieutenants you mentioned . I do n't for a moment suggest that you do it yourself . I 'd consider that dangerous . If you want it done  --  and I strongly advise it  --  I 'll be only too happy to act for you . " I could n't believe I 'd understood him . " A private understanding ? You do n't think , do you , that two naval officers would --  " " Oh dear me , yes , " Captain Cunningham said . " The poor young men have almost no private means of their own . As I understand it , you brought a deal of provisions from Boston , and a few boatloads might make all the difference . If I were you , I 'd part with all I could afford . " I pretended to consider Cunningham 's suggestion . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , Captain . That food and the rest of the Osprey 's cargo is n't mine . It 's only held in trust by me for Mrs. Byles , Mrs. Dixon and my friend Buell . I 'm afraid I 'll have to see the general again and let him know that naval officers are taking bribes . " Cunningham looked shocked . " Bribes ! They would n't be taking bribes ! They 'd merely be accepting a little present from a well-wisher ! You 've misunderstood me , Mr. Wiswell ! Just forget the whole thing , and I 'll send one of my men as far as the harbor 's mouth with the Osprey when she sails . " He clapped me on the shoulder , gave me the friendliest smile imaginable , and waved me lightly toward the muddy streets of Halifax . P201We laid the Osprey alongside the Badger schooner , lashed her there , and the two crews toiled all day transferring cargo from the sloop to the schooner . So amiably did they labor together that no stranger could have told which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching them , thought that if only enemies could be given work to do in common , there 'd be an end to war . Mrs. Byles and Henrietta Dixon sat beside the hatch , Mrs. Byles triumphantly calling out the bales and bundles as they came aboard , and Henrietta Dixon writing them in a commonplace book . " Twenty bolts of taffeta , " I heard Mrs. Byles say . " How do you spell taffeta ' , Mate Buell ? " Henrietta asked . " Witha y ' ? " " Three thousand sheets of Japan vellum , " Mrs. Byles announced . " What 's vellum for , Mate Buell ? " Henrietta asked . " Two hundred pairs of ladies ' " Mrs. Byles began ; then lowered her voice . " Ladies ' pantalets , " she whispered to Henrietta ; then again spoke loudly . " Nothing to interest you , Mate Buell . Kindly step to a distance . " He did n't , but peered over Henrietta 's shoulder as she wrote . Mrs. Byles covered the terrible word with her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his work . Towards sundown the Osprey left us , her officers and men shoutinghoarse and friendly good-bys to us across the steel-gray water ; and that night we accepted the Badger schooner as our permanent home in Halifax  --  and a cozy home we had by comparison with some of those in which our fellow fugitives from Boston were forced to live . In our hold we had the potatoes , dried peas , salt pork , flour and molasses picked up by Buell in Boston ; and in the cabin ticked Mrs. Byles ' tall clock showing the moon 's changes and the days of the month . Lashed to the cabin beams by Buell , to keep them from the questing fingers of Nathan , were Henrietta 's lamps of Irish glass ; and beside the stove , protected by a spare stays'l , was Belcher Ryles ' wigstand , holding within it a bucket of drinking water . Thanks to Buell 's foresight , our fare was almost princely ; but unhappyindeed was the lot of our fellow refugees upon the land . General Howe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during those three months the Boston refugees were never once comfortable , were almost never warm , and usually never knew whether the next day would find their stomachs full or empty . Almost without exception those refugees were penniless ; and their only means of livelihood was to sell the few belongings which they had been so fortunate as to save . Thus the streets of Halifax took on the appearance of a vast fair ; and people I 'd known all my life sat in little makeshift booths along the sidewalks , offering to the reluctant citizens of Halifax the clothing , paintings , furniture and silver that so recently had graced homes on Tremont Street and Beacon Hill . We heard strange tales of the abilities that suddenly developed in some of the unfortunates . Most of them could do nothing but sell what they had ; and when their small stores of possessions were gone , and their money too , they begged or borrowed where they could . A few , though , were different . By swapping , bargaining , buying on credit ; by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed , they increased their meager store of salable articles : increased them , had a few shillings to spend , and somehow found a way to rent rooms in which their precious stocks might he locked of.nights . I learned then , beyond question , that if all the property in the world were distributed , and an equal share given to everyone , the hulk of mankind would soon be destitute , and a few would have everything . Buell , alas , was not one of the few . He was constantly in touch with the most needy refugees , since he had suggested to General Howe that living quarters be provided for them in crowded Halifax by removingthe cabins from transports and erecting the cabins on the hillslopesabove the harbor ; and the general had not only agreed to the operation , but had seen fit to put Buell in charge of it . Each cabin brought ashore was instantly surrounded by clamorous refugees , all penniless and in fear of freezing to death during the comingwinter . Buell 's earnest simplicity forced him to listen with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lighten their sufferings . Ile was always indignantly discovering somebody for whom we had to provide  --  always angrily coming across a family of six or seven Loyalists wretchedly sheltered in a ragged tent , or an aged couple who had lived on half-rotten potatoes for a month , or some old gentleman who could n't go out in the daytime because of lacking enough to cover his nakedness.  | " Damn it , Oliver , " he said , " we 'd ought to be allowed to keep our money for ourselves ! All these people had the same chances to help themselves to rebel goods that we did , and they should ' a ' done it ! There ai n't one single damned reason why we need to give ' em a penny ; and not a shilling would they get out of me if they were back in Boston ! Still , they never damaged us , and the rebels did ; and since we stole all this stuff from rebels , I suppose we 've got to let these people have some of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this keeps on ! Smoked herrings certainly raise hob with my disposition , and I been hoping to save enough so I could go to South Carolina and improve my health with potlicker , corn bread and chittlings ; but the way it looks now , I wo n't be able to go anywhere unless General Howe takes me along . " The drain on our resources became so great that I was forced to protect Mrs. Byles and Mrs. Dixon by putting Buell on a rigid allowanceof two shillings a day . I say our resources , because Buell insisted that I should have one half the proceeds from the sale of the supplies he had loaded aboard the Osprey at Boston . He readily agreed to this interference with his freedom of action because of his fear for the future of Mrs. Byles and Mrs. Dixon . " There 's no telling what 'll happen to us , Oliver , " he said . " General Howe thinks there wo n't be any more rebellion after we 've reached wherever we 're going when we leave here ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have ended the Revolution ; but thanks to this same General Howe , it did n't ; so what makes him think he 'll do better next time ? Once a damned fool , always a damned fool ! It would n't surprise me if the Revolution lasted as long as Mrs. Loring , and she 's a young woman still . " Now s'pose the Revolution does last forever , or s'pose a rebel mob catches us , or s'pose we choke to death some morning on these damned stinking herring ! What 'll become of Mrs. Byles and Henriettaif they do n't have us to lean on ? Maybe Mrs. Byles could make out somehow ; but Henrietta , she 'd just be plumb lost . If they want to stay out of debtors ' prison , they 'll have to go to England , the way your father said , and put in claims for the property they lost when the rebels drove ' em out of Boston . That means somebody 's got to pay their passage , and they 'll have to have something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hire a lawyer ; so there just ai n't any help for it : they got to be provided for , and we 're the ones thatve to do the providing . "  | With each passing week he became more and more infuriated by the helplessness of Henrietta Dixon ; and as his fury grew , her helplessnessbecame more apparent . Whenever he went ashore , he was in a constant fever to get back to the schooner to find out , as he put it , what damned fool thing she 'd done ; and when he was with her , he was perpetually shaking his head over her blunders . What it was that ailed him , he did n't seem to know ; but since his symptoms were unmistakable , I was n't surprised when he proposed , on the eve of the army 's departure from Halifax , that all funds remaining from the sale of the Osprey 's cargo be placed in Mrs. Byles ' and Mrs. Dixon 's hands for safekeeping . " I do n't care what you do with it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but if you feel Henrietta 's incompetent , I should think you 'd hesitate to burden her with all this financial responsibility . " Buell looked embarrassed . " Oh , " he said carelessly , " she ai n't incompetentabout everything . Now if I really set out to drown that Nathan of hers , the way I 'd like to sometimes , she 'd take care of him all right in spite of the best I could do ; and if anybody  --  you , say , or  --  or  --  well , General Howe , say  --  undertook to be free and easy with her  --  wanted to squeeze her , mebbe , or kind of do a little general handiwork  --  I du n no as I make myself exactly clear , Oliver , but  --  " " I think I see what you 're getting at , " I said . Buell looked relieved . " Well , when anybody tries anything like that , she ai n't incompetent . " He looked regretfully introspective . " No , Oliver , on some points she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , money 's another point she 's competent on . Seems to me we 'd do as well to let her and Mrs. Byles take care of our funds as to put ' em in the Bank of England . Of course I would n't try to steal from the Bank of England ; it would n't be reasonable ; but I would n't undertake to steal from Mrs. Byles and Henrietta unless I was ready to see my Maker  --  which is n't the case . " He came closer and spoke behind a cupped hand . " Besides , Oliver , we do n't need money , so Henrietta and Mrs. Byles might as well have ours . I thought up a way to get more  --  as much more as we need  --  when we get where we 're going . " He glanced cautiously over his shoulder . " As much as we need ? " I asked . He nodded and drew a soiled slip of paper from his pocket . " Look at it ! " he exclaimed contemptuously . " Rebel money ! That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ai n't it terrible ? Looks like a sup-P205pository ! I could engrave a plate like that in half an hour with a hatchet ; and I could print a thousand of ' em in the time it takes you to shave , pretty near . It 'll be a real pleasure , Oliver , to trade a bundle of these to a rebel for ten dollars in real money  --  when you hear from General Howe , and if I 'm still out of jail , like he said . " I did hear from General Howe , but not until the end of May . Late one afternoon , when the slanting rays of the sun brightened the misty green halos that had just appeared upon the elms and maples of that bleak northern town , a boat rowed under our counter with one of Captain Cunningham 's aides in its stern sheets . " Captain Cunningham 's compliments , " he shouted to me . " The general 's asked your whereabouts , and Captain Cunningham suggests seeing him as soon as possible . He mentioned tomorrow morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , " I told him , " I wo n't wait till tomorrow . I 'll go back with you if you 'll give me a minute to make myself presentable . " Without waiting for an answer I ran to the cabin , with Mrs. Byles , Henrietta Dixon , Buell and Nathan close at my heels . " Wear your frilled shirt , " Mrs. Byles panted . " Henrietta , bring me the brush ! Get the sponge and look for spots on Oliver 's blue coat ! Oliver , I think you 'd better wear Belcher 's brooch . It 'll be very genteel against those frills . " Henrietta Dixon , noisily opening and closing the drawers beneath my berth , burst into tears . " Now what 's the matter ? " Buell asked her . " I never saw such a woman ! Always laughing when you ought to be crying , and crying when you ought to be laughing ! " Henrietta snuffled , shook her head , and went on opening and closing drawers . " You ought to be glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on . " It probably means we 'll both of us have a chance to do something worth doing instead of lying here in this harbor , eating smoked herring and being nursemaids . " Mrs. Dixon turned on him . " If you know where that sponge is , " she said , " get it ! I 've had all the talk I can stand ! " While Mrs. Byles helped adjust my frills , Henrietta moved helplesslyabout us , hiccuping and snuffling ; and Buell , muttering to himself , rubbed at my coat with the sponge . " When he sees this frilled shirt , Oliver , " Mrs ; Byles said , " he'll know you 're fit to go wherever an Englishman could go , and do anything anyone could do . " " You want ' em both to go , " Henrietta said accusingly . " You know you do ! " " You 'll hold your tongue , " Mrs. Byles said , " or you 'll never travel to England with me ! " " Look here , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this display of emotion ; but I 'd like it stopped . No people ever got along better together than we have aboard this schooner for the last two months , and that 's how I 'd like to remember our last days together . " " Here 's your coat , Oliver , " Buell said heartily . He helped me into it , glared at Henrietta Dixon and noisily pushed me on deck ; but noisy as his movements were , they were n't noisy enough to drown the renewed snuffling of Henrietta Dixon , or Nathan 's howls of sympathetic sorrow.  |p207I  DETESTED Halifax for more reasons than one , and I always went ashore reluctantly , knowing I 'd encounter scores of Bostonians I knew , all urgently in need of assistance I could n't give . Now that Howe had asked for me , I was eager for once to climb the slippery ladder to the central dock ; but even still my eagerness was shadowed by the dread of again seeing the hopeless glances , the weary dejection , of all those poor banished souls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbed the ladder close behind me ; and when he reached the top , he shouted angrily and darted past me toward a throng of men who stood idly in the broad space at the dockhead . " Get yourself to one side or the other , " he ordered brusquely . " You 've been told not to hang about here where you 're forever underfoot ! Why do n't you obey orders ? Where 's your captain ? " When none of the men answered , the aide snapped , " Any officer 'll do ! Push one of ' em out and let him talk ! " Every one of the men was literally in rags  --  rags that would have made any scarecrow look well dressed . Some were shirtless ; some shoeless . In place of stockings , most of them wore sacking tied at the ankle and below the knee . Their breeches were patched with odds and ends of cloth cut from curtains , bags , women 's dresses . One of these grotesques gave the aide a halfhearted salute . " They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some clothes and tents , " he said . " Why , " I said , " those men are Americans ! " " They 're a bloody nuisance , " the aide said . " They 've been here three days , underfoot every damned minute ! " P208I went closer to the scarecrow figures . " Are you a military organization ? " I asked . " Where are you from ? " They spoke up cheerfully enough . " New York Volunteers , " they said , and a score of voices named their homes  --  " Bloomingdale , Hoboken , Princeton , Dobbs Ferry , Poughkeepsie . " I singled out the man who 'd replied to Cunningham 's aide . " Am I to understand you 've come here to offer your services to General Howe ? How 'd you get here , if you 've only been here three days ? How 's it happen you 've no uniforms or equipment ? " " There ai n't any way we can get anything , " the man said , answering my last question first . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last January , they did n't give us time to sell anything , or get our hands on any money , so ever since we 've had to get along on what we wore when we got away . " " Captain Grant and Captain Campbell , they formed us into companies , " another ragged soldier said . " We fought the rebels when they were burning Loyalist farms , but when they got to outnumberingus ten to one , we had to run for it . Captain Grant and Captain Campbell , they led us across to Staten Island and , got us out to the King 's ships at Sandy Hook . We lived on ' em three months , till they sailed up here a week ago . " " How 'd it happen the ships ' officers did n't supply you with clothes ? " I asked . The men stared at me blankly . One of them said , " I guess they did n't have any to spare . " Captain Cunningham 's aide undertook to explain the situation . " They 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even been reviewed , nor are their officers regularly appointed . They just appeared here a few days ago , and there is n't anything they do n't want ! Morning , noon and night they 're standing around while their so-called officers ask for this and that and t' other . " I looked at him hard , wondering if he could be speaking in all seriousness . I saw that he was . " Where can I find your officers ? " I asked the ragged men . They shook their heads . " They 're on the go all the time , " one said . " Captain Grant and Lieutenant Hewlett , they 're usually around the commissary general 's . Captain Campbell and Lieutenant Taylor , they spend their time waiting in officers ' tents . " Cunningham 's aide laughed abruptly . " Keep clear of those officers ,  |p209Mr  . Wiswell : if you ever run into ' em , they 'll dry you up telling you their troubles . " " Here 's Lieutenant Hewlett now , " a man said . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue uniformcoat patched at the elbows and on the cuffs with scarlet , trotted onto the dock . From his belt hung an old iron-hilted ship 's cutlass . " All right , men , " he shouted . " The captain 's got twenty fathoms of cod line for us , and a thousand feet of lumber ; also permission to pitch camp . Fall in ! " The ragged soldiers gabbled excitedly and formed themselves in line . I spoke to the lieutenant . " Lieutenant Hewlett , my name 's Wiswell . I 'm from Boston , and I 'd certainly like to help you if I can . How does it happen these men of yours ca n't get decent clothes ? " Hewlett ran a quick eye over me . " Well , Mr. Wiswell , we 're not on the establishment . If we can get on the establishment , we 'll probably be all right . " " Have you seen General Howe ? " I asked . " We saw one of his aides , " Hewlett said . " He could n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get a crack at the rebels . We 'll take their clothes  --  if they have any . " He eyed the long line of ragged soldiers who waited for orders . " You 'll have to excuse me , Mr. Wiswell . These men have n't had any food today . I want to start ' em catching some fish . " He gave me a hurried nod , shouted " Left , heel ! Forward , hup ! " and ran to the head of the moving line . Ignoring the murmurings of Cunningham 's aide , I hurried off toward headquarters , seething with rage at the stupidity of armies and army officers . I grew cooler while I waited for my audience with the general ; for he was at dinner when I arrived , and that function was so interminablethat nothing could have stayed hot for so long a period . Not until eleven o'clock did he come heavily into his office . He came steadily enough , but his eyelids drooped , as if he were ready for bed ; and he was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clothes and all . He had me before him at once , and as he stared at me , he rubbed the dark circles beneath his eyes with a puffy forefinger . " Sorry to keep you waiting a few moments , Mr. Wiswell , " he said . " Did n't expect you until tomorrow , but it 's well you came tonight . I 've just now discussed your case with our new commissary of prisoners  --  a fellow townsman of yours : Mr. Joshua Loring . " His attitude was overcareless . " No doubt you know Commissary Loring ? " " Only slightly , " I said . " My father was better acquainted with him and his lovely wife . " The general coughed and adjusted the gold gorget at his throat . " Now , Mr. Wiswell , " he said , " you 're not inclined to be a fighting man as yet , but you want to help your country escape from the clutches of demagogues who are ruining it . You 're an educated man , able to understand what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When we leave here , Mr. Wiswell , we 're going to Long Island , and in a few weeks , in all likelihood , the city of New York will be ours and the rebellion of your fellow countrymen ended . Accordingto the information I 've received , the Loyalists on Long Island and in New York greatly outnumber the rebels . It 's also my understanding that since the rebels have an army , even though it 's a bad one , and since the Loyalists have n't , the rebels are making life miserable for everyone on Long Island , just as they did for those in Boston . As you well understand , Mr. Wiswell , that 's not a pleasant situation . " The general paused and eyed me sleepily . " Yes , sir , " I said . " Well , " Howe said , " there it is . The rebels are raising the devil , but I do n't know the details . I want you to get them for me . I want to know who 's bulldozing the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 's lodging the information , leading the mobs , and terrorizing decent , law-abiding people on Long Island and in New York . What are they doing to those they throw into jail ? " The general 's fist thundered on the table . " By God , Wiswell , I 'm a long-suffering man , and I 'll take no advantage of those who 're standing up for their beliefs ; but I wo n't see honest men treated like felons without raising a hand against those responsible for it ! " He leaned forward and fixed me with heavy-lidded eyes . " Will you , Wiswell ? " " No , General . " " No , nor anybody else , " Howe said . " If we drive the rebels out of Long Island and New York this summer , as we shall , I 'll not have those informers and those leaders of the mob nipping at our heels like ill-tempered dogs . What 's more , the rebels I capture will be treated as our own people have been treated  --  no better and no worse. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , Wiswell : how they 've been treated . How , where , why and by whom . I know it 's not an easy task . In fact , it 's one of the most difficult of wartime operations , but a highly necessary one . It calls for education , judgment , dexterity , quick thinking . Now then : do you think you can do it ? Can you find out what I want to know , and write it all down in a clear and ample report ? " " But if I were in the army , " I said , " the rebels would n't allow me to " You would n't be in the army , " the general said sharply . " You told me yourself you did n't want to be . You 'd be loosely attached to the commissary for prisoners , and you 'll be particularly assigned to the needs of Loyalists . You 'll go along with us when we move to Long Island , and ostensibly you 'll be under Mr. Loring . Mr. Stedman will also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congenially with Mr. Stedman . In reality , you 'll be answerable only to me , and you 'll bring your written and other information to me . I 'll expect you to make me fully acquainted with what the Loyalists are saying as well as how they 're being treated . I 'll expect you to gather all the information you can  --  and to help you , you can have that man of yours : that person the rebels tarred and feathered . Bowel , was n't it , or some such name ? " " Buell , " I said . " Buell or Bowel : all the same , " Howe said testily . " Of course , I ca n't pay him as much as I can you , but  --  " " Nothing , " I said quickly . " I need nothing , and neither does Buell . I 'll do whatever I can to help any mistreated countryman of mine , and so will Buell ; but not for pay , General . " " No compensation , eh ? " Howe asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! There 'll be times , no doubt , when you 'll be playing a lone hand  --  rowing your own canoe , I believe you Americans say  --  and funds might be difficult for you to obtain if you had to depend on Mr. Loring . As you can see , Wiswell , you 'll be a member of my own staff , in a way : yet you wo n't be in uniform , and I wo n't be able to protect you in certain contingencies . " " I think I understand , " I said . " That means I 'll be a spy , does n't it ? " " Do you have moral scruples against spying ? " Howe asked politely . " None , sir . " " I 'm glad of that , " Howe said . " The best and bravest officers in every army have always been proud to obtain for their commandersP212the intelligence without which a campaign must fail . You can call your duties whatever you wish . All I can say is that I 'm asking you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone  --  the work of getting intelligence which , if obtained , will secure your own countrymen against brutality and outrages . " " There 's just one thing , sir , " I said . " If Buell and I do the work you 've chosen for us , I 'd like to be sure you 'll trust us . " The general frowned . " Come , come , Mr. Wiswell ! How 'm I to interpret that ! " " As a respectful request , sir , " I said . " If Buell and I bring you informationthat you do n't like  --  information that does n't agree with your ideas  --  I would n't want either of us to be punished or discredited for doing our best . In other words , sir , if you consider us fit to run risks for you , I want to be sure you 're prepared to believe what we say . I want to be able to make any sort of report , so long as it 's true , and not have to guard against being too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The truth is exactly what I want , so considerall your doubts ended . " " In that case , General , " I said , " I 'd like to make a report right now on two companies of Loyalist troops that I just saw . They 're New York Volunteers . They fought to keep Loyalists from being mistreated ; and when they were outnumbered , they took refuge on  --  " " I 've heard about them , Mr. Wiswell . " " But they 're half naked , " I protested . " They 're Americans , offering to help you put down a rebellion , and nothing 's being done for ' em  --  nothing ! They 're not being clothed , not being decently fed . " " You do n't understand , Mr. Wiswell , " Howe said . " These men are n't on the establishment . " " Establishment be damned , sir ! " " Ah yes , " Howe said , " but if no provision is made and no fund established from which these men may be clothed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I become personally responsible . " " There must be a way around , sir , " I protested . " You owe it to every Loyalist in America to see that these troops receive a cordial welcome and ample support . Nobody will ever believe that so powerful a general as yourself could possibly lack the power to furnishcommon necessaries for two hundred men  --  unless he was unfavorablydisposed toward all Loyalists . " " Mr. Wiswell , " Howe said , " you no doubt mean well , but your knowledge of army procedure is abysmal . Your duty ends when youp213supply me with the information I want . The New York Loyalists are my affair . From you I want information concerning conditions on Long Island . Is that clear ? " All that was clear to me was that the war , in which I 'd hoped not to be caught , had me by the heels , and that I 'd better make the best of it . In the two weeks that remained to us before we sailed from Halifax , Buell , stirred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving the hated smoked herring of Nova Scotia forever behind him , sold the Badger schooner for  --  600 , disposed of the Osprey 's cargo for another  --  1100 , established my father 's servant Andrew and Mrs. Byles ' Maggie as the owners of a restaurant , obtained temporary quarters for Mrs. Byles , Henrietta and Nathan in rooms vacated by two of Howe 's young officers , took passage for them on a barkentinefor Bristol , and built for himself a little hand press that , when dismantled , filled less than a quarter of a seaman 's chest . He set up the press in Mrs. Byles ' bedroom , and spent his spare moments striking off eight-dollar Continental notes and simultaneously advisingHenrietta what to do when she reached London . " You want to remember , Henrietta , " he said , " that I 've traveled , and you have n't ; and you want to remember , too , that most travelers have one thing in common .

" I 'm different , " he repeated , adjusting another sheet of paper in his press , " but all the others are alike : let ' em travel in strange places , and they want the food they had at home . When a Bostonian goes to Philadelphia , he wants beans and scrod . When a Nova Scotiaman goes to Boston , he wants smoked herring .

You tell an Americanin London where he can get corned-beef hash , or finnan haddie , or salt fish and pork scraps , or tongues and cheeks by merely runningfive miles , and he 'll run five miles every day . " Bear that in mind , Henrietta , and get yourself a tavern in London  --  justa neat little place where Americans can get Indian pudding , hash , fish balls and baked beans , and they 'll probably have to call out the troops to scatter the mobs of Americans that try to break down the front door . " Mrs. Byles thumped her cane upon the floor . " Buell , you never spoke a truer word . I remember how Belcher wasted away on muttonand cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chowder , he broke down and cried ! We 'll have a tavern in London , Tom Buell ; and if you and Oliver ever come to see us , there 'll be nothing lacking to make you think of Boston  --  nothing but a mob to tar and feather you , and an army of grandfathers to chase you every time you set foot outdoors . " Buell , finished with his money-making , wiped ink from his press with a rag moistened with acrid-smelling fluid . " We 'll come fast enough , " he said . " You 've given me an idea . I 've been idling away my time too long ! Starting tomorrow I 'm going to collect the most useful things any man could have if he 's forced to live anywhere near an army  --  autographs and orders . Six months from now I 'll be able to write my own orders and order myself anywhere any general takes a notion not to send me . " He looked significantly at Henrietta Dixon and added , " So bear in mind , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in London , that every footstep may be that of Thomas Buell ! " We left Halifax on the eighth of June , after a night of cheering , toast-drinking and gaiety such as Halifax had never before seen , and never , I was sure , would see again . Somewhere and somehow Buell had obtained a case of champagne in the hope that it would rest gently upon his eager stomach ; and we dined royally on pork pie , roast goose and bread pudding at the Royal George Tavern before embarking aboard the Greyhound frigate . We drank scores of toasts , I seem to remember : toasts to HalifaxP215because we hoped and believed we 'd never see the place again ; toasts to the peaceful life that lay before Mrs. Byles and Mrs. Dixon in England ; toasts to the imminent downfall of Sam Adams and all his crew of rabble-rousers ; toasts to the Loyalists of America , who had sacrificed their homes and fortunes rather than submit to the rule of the mob ; toasts , toward the end , to little Nathan , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loaves , surreptitiously soaked in champagne , which Buell had fed him  --  and at the end of each toast I drank a silent one of my own to Sally Leighton and the day , now near , when I should climb again the slope of MiltonHill to find her dark eyes as kind and her hand as soft in mine as they had been before politicians wrecked our lives . Between toasts , Mrs. Byles told us strange tales of Belcher and of girls she 'd known in cloistered Cambridge . " Never a one of them , " Mrs. Byles said darkly , pounding her stick upon the floor , " never a one of them but had a secret indiscretion locked within her bosom , a secret she carried with her to her grave . " " And how , " Buell asked , " how did you know it ? " " Found out about it , " she replied , hiccuping openly , and added , " they were just like me , only I 've got three or four I 'm carrying to my grave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " Henrietta Dixon became the soul of helplessness . At the thought of Mrs. Byles ' unnamed indiscretions , she wept and rocked in her chair ; came to rest , sobbing , against Buell 's shoulder . Yet when Buell , trying to comfort her , placed her across two chairs and said what she needed was to have her stays loosened , she sat up suddenly and fetched him a clout that hurt both his feelings and his nose . " That ai n't right of you , Henrietta , " he said reproachfully . " I was n't going to do it myself . " Doubtless he saw Mrs. Byles , just then , as plural ; for he added , " I was going to ask one of the ladies to do it . " " Which one ? " Mrs. Byles inquired earnestly . " Me or me ? " When , later , we went to the wharves , Mrs. Byles and Henrietta I ) ixon went too ; and the whole population of Halifax seemed to move with us , laughing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning of the end of the tribulations that had so long oppressed America . The fleet of transports and warships were ranged before the wharves like a bristling curtain on which burned a thousand flares ; and across the wriggling fiery reflections in the black water moved flatboats by the hundreds .   Scores of tar kettles blazed on the wharves , and in their smoky glare the whole population of the city waved and shouted last goodbysto the torrent of uniformed men who cascaded down over the edge of the wharves and into the waiting flatboats . I saw again , as I had seen in Boston , the families of James Putnam , John Joy , General Timothy Ruggles , Daniel Leonard , Ward Chipman , Edward Winslow , Dr. Adino Paddock and other old acquaintances ; saw the Lorings and the Hallowells ; saw Gardiners , Faneuils , Courtneys , Fluckers , Debloises , Greens , Chandlers , Grays ; but the womenfolk were no longer in a panic : no longer running away . They were gay in the knowledge that their men were on their way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this departure there seemed to be no sadness : only an eager anticipation . I felt Henrietta Dixon 's wet lips upon my cheek ; smelt the lavender on Mrs. Byles ' cap as she stood on tiptoe to kiss me good-by . Then Buell , singing lustily , fell into the boat beside me , picked himself up from the bottom , fell down again and came to rest across my knees . " Oliver , " he said earnestly , " I would n't wonder if there was something in those Perkins ' Metallic Tractors after all ! I got fifty pairs of ' em wrapped in a cloth and tied around my waist , and for the first time in my life , Oliver , I ai n't hiccuped once ! I 'm good and drunk ! " P217GENERAL HowE may have been reckless at the gaming table and ardent in his affairs of the heart ; but in war he was as careful and methodical as an old lady preparing for bed . Nay , he was more  --  he was as reluctant as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the twenty-third of June was shimmering and steamy ; and as we drew close to the low blue shores of Long Island and the misty islands guarding New York Harbor , the flagship of our fleet came to anchor . So , too , did the Greyhound frigate , on which Buell and I had left Halifax , and the three sloops-of-war that had kept up with us . Why we should lie a good three miles from shore , rocking slowly on an oily swell , was a mystery to everyone aboard the Greyhound ; but there we lay all night , rolling and screaking . Little sloops , manned by Long Island Loyalists , slipped past us like shadows ; from them spectral voices hailed our quarter-deck , asking where they might find General Howe ; and we could hear splashings and far-off tappingsas they mounted the ladder of the general 's vessel . In the morning we moved onward in light airs to the Narrows , and dropped anchor close to the green and rolling shore of Staten Island . Only a mile away , across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the high land at its end we could see a rough fort and guns . That fort on Brooklyn Heights looked across at the houses of New York just as the rough fortifications on Bunker Hill had looked across at Boston ; and to all of us it seemed apparent that when the rest of the army arrived from Halifax , the Heights of Brooklyn would be as easy to capture from the rebels who had so foolishly fortified them as Bunker Hill should have been .   But Howe , as I have already said , was cautious  --  as cautious as a wary old rabbit stealing out at dawn with quivering nose and oscillatingears to feed upon a row of dewy lettuces . For five long , hot days we lay off Staten Island doing nothing , while Buell made himself a padded weskit with eight-dollar notes basted between two layers of silk that I recognized as once belonging to a skirt of Henrietta Dixon 's . He hummed as he worked , and I knew that the sentimental value of that vest far outweighed the counterfeit currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning of the twenty-ninth the remainder of our fleet came in ; and all day long those ships , barks , barkentines , brigs and brigantines appeared as faint white pin points in the far haze to the eastward . The white specks became white oblongs ; grew into tall pyramids of gleaming canvas ; and at last , flags aflutter and bulwarks lined with cheering freight , came into the wind and dropped anchor amid the great fleet that ringed the end of Staten Island with a halo of yellow masts and spars . Buell 's weskit-making was premature , for instead of crossing over to Long Island to drive the rebels from their fortifications , Howe disembarkedhis whole army on Staten Island  --  piled them ashore in squads , companies , brigades , regiments and divisions , until every sheltered green meadow on the island was transformed into a town of tents  --  a town in which drums rolled all day and long lines of scarlet-clad men drilled and drilled ; in which bored soldiers dickered , wrangled , gambled , fought , drank , cursed from dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed the long nights through . During our first few days on Staten Island we lived in a fog of rumors that seemed almost tangible  --  a sort of miasma above those towns of tents and marquees . All through those days a heat mist rose from the land , shrouding the distant small houses of New York and even the near-by shores of Long Island in a gray haze ; and that haze , oppressive as it was , was less oppressive than the rumors . The worst of the rumors said that the colonies had finally and irrevocably declared themselves independent of Great Britain , so that all hope of compromise between England and America was at an end ; that the mobs in the colonies had effectively gained theP219upper hand ; that those who disagreed with them would be proscribedand banished , their property seized and sold to the highest bidder and their leaders put to death ; that men and women throughout the colonies , by means of outrageous lies , were being incited to look upon every Loyalist as a monster of depravity and cruelty ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beliefs would , if captured by the rebels , be first tortured and then hanged ; that rebel regiments were a plague upon the country , robbing , burningand committing every conceivable outrage upon friend and enemy alike ; that General Howe , by so long delaying his departure from Halifax , might be obliged to wait a year before he could start a campaignagainst the rebels ; that at Howe 's first attempt to land upon the mainland , the rebels proposed to destroy every town along the seacoast and retire to the shelter of the mountains . The rumors were bad enough ; but they were only rumors , half believed . The truth , when I was summoned to General Howe 's headquartersto hear it from the lips of Frank James , seemed even worse . My summons came from Joshua Loring , commissary of prisoners , and as soon as Buell heard what Loring 's servant had to say to me , he at once began to put away his engraving tools with which he had been working on a plate for a new forty-dollar bill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " If those eight-dollar bills of mine are only worth a dollar , and a forty-dollar bill is only worth what an eight-dollar bill used to be worth , we 'd soon have to carry our money in a cart if we wanted to buy anything bigger than an awful little sheep . Not another pair of Perkins ' Metallic Tractorswill I ever sell for paper money ! Hard money , or something good to eat , is all I 'll ever take for Metallic Tractors till this war is over ! " As we hurried between the long avenues of tents on our way to the farmhouse occupied by General Howe , he continued his grumbling about rebel money . " Even if the rebels had n't tarred and feathered me , " he said , " I 'd hate ' em for what they 've done to money . They 've started the most expensive thing there is  --  a war  --  without having enough money to begin with , and they think they can make all they need by just printing it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works . The more they print , the less they 'll have ; and those that lose the most are the ones that have the least to lose  --  just the ones that think they 're going to get the most out of fighting a war . I ai n't got any objection to taking something away from folks that have plenty , provided I do n't hurt anybody else when I do it ; but I do n't approve of stealing from people that do n't have anything to begin with , especially when it obliges me to come back and steal from ' em again and again , every time having to steal twice as much as I stole before . All in all , and coming down to the hard facts , the simple meaning of it is , the more money the rebels print , the more I got to print myself , till it might come to be a hardship . " " Stop worrying about rebel money , " I said . " Unless every Loyalist is wrong , it 'll be no better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' time . " " That 's all it 's worth now , " Buell said . " That 's all it 'll ever be worth , after a few more people find out what it 's worth , meaning nothing . My forty-dollar bills are just as good as Congress ' fortydollarbills , neither me nor Congress having anything to make ' em good with , so I got just as much right to issue ' em as Congress has . The rebels called themselves a government , did n't they , even though you and I and a million other Americans did n't want ' em to do it , and knew they had n't any business to ? All right : I 'm a government , too , Oliver ! I 'm the government of New India , up on Passamaquoddy Bay ! This money of mine , it 's the legal currency of New India , and I raised it by taxing myself . If I was a private individual , I 'd be more careful ; but being as I 'm a government , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way I choose , especially by spendinga lot more money than I 've got or ever will have , and promising to do things that I ai n't got a chance of doing . " Buell was like that : Whenever he put his mind on anything , whether it was money , Henrietta Dixon , his indigestion , or the potlickerof South Carolina , he theorized about it until his listeners ' numbed ears refused their proper office of conveying meanings to the mind , and heard but vacant sound . I was still hearing that kind of sound when we arrived at the general 's headquarters . The scene here was calculated to quiet the fears of those who thought the rebels would long continue to print their worthless currency . The slopes on either side of the farmhouse were dotted with tents . Tents stretched off to the westward and to the eastward as far as we could see , and the strip of blue water between the tent-flecked fields of Staten Island and the opposite Long Island shore bristled with the masts of transports , sloops-of-war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesser craft  --  sloops and flatboats belonging to Loyalist sympathizers from Long Island . There was an air of confidence about the scores of officers , soldiers and civilians who bustled in and out of The Rose and Crown farmhouse , and most assured of all in appearance was the commissary of prisoners , Joshua Loring , who stood near the front door talking with a tall man who seemed made up of knobs . This knobby man was so gangling and so awkward that he looked artificial , as though he 'd been sawed out of wood and nailed together by an inept carpenter . On his knobby head was perched a cloth cap too small for him ; and up and down his long throat , when he spoke or swallowed , which was often , surged an Adam 's apple the size of a plucked woodcock . His neck was too thin for his shirt ; his arms were too long for his sleeves ; his breeches too small for his legs . His knees and wrists were knobby and so were his large fingers , whose joints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Loring , I saw , had put on weight since that unhappy night when we had overtaken him and his pretty wife outside the barricades in Roxbury ; and there was a smug and arrogant look about him , as is often the case with men who have unexpectedly acquired great power or great wealth . He greeted me with an excessive affability that gave me the feeling he was inwardly dwelling upon the  --  6,000 a year that General Howe was paying him . " The general made a point of having you come here to meet Mr. James , " he said , and airily waved a hand toward the knobby man . " Mr. James of Long Island . Mr. James has worked miracles on our behalf , and I think the general hopes he 'll be of service to you . " Joints cracked in James ' hands . His Adam 's apple moved ; he worked his neck as if to free it from his already loose collar , and stared at the heavens with a seaman 's calculating eye . Never a word did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the innocently wide-eyed stare which Buell gave me , I knew he suspected that the services we were about to receive from Frank James would be negligible . Loring led us at once into headquarters , waving aside the gaudy young aides who tried officiously to be parties to our entrance ; and when he pushed us into the front room , we found General Howe tanding with a hulk of a man at the window that looked outacross the Narrows to Long Island . When the general and his visitor turned to look at us , I was conscious of a vague resentment that Howe should be on terms of familiarity with such a man . Not only was he loutish in his appearance , with a thick nose , thick lips , bad teeth and the same sort of slyly malicious grin upon his heavy features that I 'd seen on half-witted boys who delighted in torturing harmless birds or helpless puppies , but he was dirty and disheveled . His old green uniform coat was streaked with the remains of past meals ; his hair could n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a string than a ribbon ; his stockings were wrinkled and his shoes broken ; and worst of all , he had a pungently dirty smell that seemed to be a blend of old , old alehouses , rank tobacco smoke , sweat , ammonia , uncleaned harnesses and damp old clothes . Howe gave us a negligent wave of his hand and spoke to the knobby-featured Frank James . " Good ! Good ! Glad you 're here , Mr.James ! Sit down ; sit down ! Sit down , all of you . We 've several things to discuss , Mr. James . You 've met Mr. Wiswell and Mr. Buell , I see . This other gentleman is Colonel Robert Rogers , who proposes to do us a great service . I need your help for all three of ' em . " James took off his hat , perched himself upon the edge of a chair , and clasped his enormous fingers tight around the chair arm . His long neck and legs seemed to fold into his clothes like an accordion ; his Adam 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes fastened sharply and eagerly upon the general . He no longer seemed knobby and gangling , but capable and resourceful . " Mr. James , " the general said , " I 've heard from Captain Barton of the assistance you 've given him in holding the rebels in check on these waters , and I 'm as indebted to you as he is . If I 've been correctlyinformed , you 've confined your activities largely to Jamaica Bay and the waters around Long Island for the past six months , and are n't familiar with what 's going on ashore . " James took a firmer grip on the arm of his chair . " General , " he said huskily , " there 's nobody that sails out of Long Island that is n't familiar with what 's going on . The whole damned island , begging your pardon , is being terrorized by two regiments of rebel militia and that hellion Christopher Duyckinck 's mob . We 've tried to avoid a war , General . We 've submitted to having our arms seized , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't get into the front door of a decent man 's house ; we 've seen our best men sent away to rot and starve in jail ; had our boys forced into that rotten rebel militia at the points of bayonets ; had our farms plundered andp223our cattle driven away by thieves that call themselves rebel cavalry ! We 've been threatened and yapped at by committees that do n't even know how to run a henhouse properly ; and a good part of our men are hiding on the brush plains and in swamps , so they wo n't be rounded up and sent to Norwich Jail or Simsbury Mines or some worse place  --  if there is any . " He drew a deep breath , and his Adam 's apple leaped momentarily above the line of his collar . " That 's what 's going on , General , and that 's why four men out of every five on Long Island hope to God you wo n't waste any time getting over there with your army . " The general nodded heavily . " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " All in good season . Everything you say I 've heard before , and I think you 'll find the burdens of your unhappy island will soon be lightened . " Colonel Rogers spoke in a thick , clabbery voice . " You say they 're hiding in the swamps ? If I were to lead ' em out , General --  " Howe shook his head decisively . " You 're to raise your Rangers on the other side of the Sound , Colonel Rogers ! I 'm in no position to arm those men in the swamps , and I want to find out certain things about ' em from Mr. Wiswell . You let Long Island alone for the moment , Colonel . " Rogers laughed vacantly . James relinquished his grip on his chair arm and wiped the palm of his hand against his knee . The general turned back to James . " No doubt , Captain , you 've had the pleasure of meeting Judge Jones of the Supreme Court . " James ' brick-red face grew darker . " There ai n't anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There never was a finer man in this world ! The rebels took him away from his wife and his family , sent him over to Connecticut and threw him in Norwich Jail ! Yes , and Daniel Kissam and Judge Daniel Horsemanden , and Governor Cadwallader Colden and his son , and Lindley Murray , the best Quaker that ever lived , and John Rapalye , and the Hewletts --  " Yes , yes , " the general said , " so I understand . And are you also familiar with what has happened to Judge Jones since he 's been in Norwich Jail ? How has he been treated ? " " His family has n't heard from him , " James said . The general nodded . " That was my understanding . What happened to Kissam ? " James ' knuckles cracked loudly . " There 's no way of knowing , General . "  |p224Howe  got up from his chair and went to the window to look across the Narrows at the hazy fortifications on the Heights of Brooklyn . " No way of knowing , eh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the swamps of Massapequa ? What about the four hundred Loyalists who deserted from the rebel militia to hide iii the brush ? What about the Loyalists lodged in Kingston Jail ? Who are the rebel informers that are driving honest , peaceful , law-abiding citizens from their homes and families ? " He whirled to shake his fist at James . " Who are they ? Name those informers ! " James moved uneasily on the edge of his chair . " They 've been mighty careful not to let themselves be known , General . " " Well , I 've got to know , " Howe said . " I want to know the condition of the Loyalists in the Hempstead swamps , now that the rebel militia has hemmed them in . How many have been killed for refusing to follow the leadership of blacksmiths , butchers , shoe . makers , farm hands ? How many are dying with fevers ? How many are starving to death ? Do you know ? " James shook his head . " No , sir . " General Howe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as fa  --  miliar with Long Island as I could wish . " He rapped a fat fore . finger against his palm . " I propose to know those things , Captain James ! Mr. Loring 's my commissioner of prisoners , and he 'll have to know them , too . When my army moves over to Long Island to drive out the rebels , I want to know who our secret enemies are , If they 're maltreating our people , I want to put an end to it . Thine rebels ca n't behave like barbarians , and at the same time make the world think all the barbarities are on our side ! I 'm sending Colonel Rogers to Connecticut to raise a corps of Rangers , and I 'm sending Mr. Wiswell and Mr. Buell into the Long Island swamps to find out exactly what 's happening there . You 're to get them safely across t0 Long Island , Captain James , and set them safely on their way . I want all three of them landed on Long Island tonight . Will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His Adam 's apple rose and fell . can land them safely , General , " he said ; " but I do n't know how long they 'll be safe . " Buell and I , in company with Colonel Rogers , left Staten Island at midnight that night on Frank James ' sloop . Before we started , Buell had outlined his plans to nor . " There'sP225one thing I do n't want , Oliver , " he said , " and that 's to make people suspicious . These rebels are the suspiciousest people there are , except for those who do n't want to get into trouble with rebels . The way I look at it , there wo n't be anybody who ai n't suspicious of us if we try to keep out of sight or hide behind a bush every time we see anyone . What 's more , we 're supposed to be talking to people : not hidingbehind bushes or keeping out of everybody 's way . Ai n't that right , Oliver ? " " Yes , " I said , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we 'll be passed from one to the other until we get where we 're going . Buell looked dissatisfied . " That do n't give me any chance to talk to rebels , " he objected . " If I ca n't talk to rebels , how can 1 sell any of my Metallic Tractors or spend my good Congress money ? A Loyalist would n't want either  --  not without you tied him up and rammed ' em down his throat ! No , sir , I got a better scheme than yours ! " I knew from experience that Buell 's ideas were frequently worth hearing , so I just waited for him to explain . " The way I see it , " he went on , " the best way to keep people away from you is to make a kind of a nuisance of yourself ; and the best way to keep people from paying attention to you is to keep pushing yourself in front of ' em . Just suppose I kept coming around your front door two or three times a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could sell you something . How 'd you feel about me ? " Since the answer was obvious , I said nothing . " Yes , sir , " Buell continued , " you 'd certainly hate me ; and if you ran into me on the street , you 'd most likely look the other way . Well , Oliver , I 've got me a bell  --  the noisiest scissors-grinder 's bell I can find  --  and a scissors-grinder 's box with a nice little round , red scissors-grinder 's grindstone fixed on it , to strap on my back . I 've put a false bottom on the box and packed all my money underneath it , and I 'm going to go all around Long Island , ringing my bell and holleringtill everybody 'll wish I was dead ! I 'll sharpen scissors , shears , bayonets and razors , mend clocks , brooches , or busted shoe buckles ; solder pans , sword hilts and kettles ; fix anything that needs fixing or buy anything that anybody 's willing to sell . How 's that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " I said , " and I think the idea 's a good one ; but if that 's the way you want to travel , we 'll have to part company . I want to see Loyalists ; and I want to go to ' em well recommended , so they wo n't have any hesitation about talking to me. "  | " That 's all right , " Buell said cheerfully . " You go see your Loyalists . and I 'll just go hollering along the road . If you need me , you wo n't have any trouble finding me on account of my bell . If you let me know where you 're going to be each night , you 'll have to be deaf not to know where I am . " Anticipating a hard day on the morrow , I 'd have been glad to sleep during our trip to Jamaica Bay on James ' sloop , but Colonel Rogers would n't have it so . He wanted to drink ; and even more than he wanted to drink , seemingly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of past exploits , military and amatory . He came aboard the sloop in an alcoholic aura , and the first questionhe asked was whether anyone had any rum . When James admitted to having a bottle or two in his seaman 's chest , the colonel jovially pressed him to bring it out . It was a chest with four large bottles and eight small . Two of the large ones were filled with rum , another with apple brandy and the fourth with port . Rogers drank over half of them himself , after which he gaily commandeered Buell 's small supply and then my own . When everything else was gone , he willingly contributed his own canteen , which held a gallon and was filled with rum . That clabbery voice of his went thickly on and on , pausing only when he drank ; and at the end of each drink he contrived to exhale so gustily as to drown out any other speaker . Thus he held the floor , with small exceptions , all the night . He told the tallest tales I 'd ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led in the Old French War ; of marches , performedby him and his men , of six hundred , eight hundred , a thousandmiles through trackless forests ; of distinguished statesmen who had cruelly wronged him and kept him from performing tasks of incredible magnitude ; of books and plays he had written , great men he had known , far-off places he had visited . As I might have spoken of Governor Hutchinson and Soame Leighton , he spoke of the King of England and how the King had said to him , " Colonel , I believe you 've got the answer to our troubles . " There was no telling whether he was making up his stories out of whole cloth , or whether all these strange things had actually happened to him . He was so casual in speaking of marvels that I only half believed him . There was something disgusting about him , too , that destroyedP227confidence . That soiled , red-eyed hulk of a man talked about the thousands of streetwalkers in London with a reminiscent smacking of his thick lips ; and whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he went into vivid details of the peculiarities of the women of the different tribes . He told us , with relish , innumerable shocking things about the women of the Sioux , of the Mandanswho , he insisted , were descended from Welsh tribes who had come to America long centuries ago . He claimed to have fought as a general in the army of the Dey of Algiers , and to have had six women in gauze pantaloons allotted to him by the Dey . As he talked , he drank and hiccuped and belched , and Buell becamemore and more restive . In the end he broke in by main strength on Rogers ' alcoholic maunderings . " You ought to be careful how you take up with so many women , " Buell said , " or you 'll get sick . You ought to --  " " Sick ! " Rogers bellowed gaily . " You do n't know anything about being sick ! What 's a little sickness , anyway ! Why , they got me down into the Carolinas a few years ago to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right on the edge of the Cherokee Country , and I showed those Cherokees more about fighting in a month than they 'd learned in a thousand years ! Well , sir , I was as good as king of that country around Ninety Six ; and what I do n't know about Cherokee women ai n't worth knowing ! They 're the best of the lot ! Yes , sir , they 're almost white , and near as tall as I am , and they ai n't fat ! No , sir , there ai n't a spare ounce on ' em , the way there is on Winnebagos and Sac and Fox women , and they do n't toe in . Still and all , they 're strong as horses , and they 're pretty ! Yes , sir , they 're pretty as pictures , and they live in white houses , all white clay , white as snow . There ai n't any Indian women anywhere can touch ' em . There 's just one trouble with ' em : they 've seen too much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Savannah . You do n't want to go to Ninety Six , or have much to do with Cherokee women , unless you 've got plenty of calomel and black salve with you to take care of the sores ! " He took a mouthful of rum , washed it around in his mouth with a sound as of many waters , swallowed it , and hiccuped sonorously . " What you should ' a ' had , " Buell interjected , " is a pair of Perkins ' Metallic Tractors . " He drew a pair from his pocket and explained their miraculous properties at great length , while Rogers stared at them out of pouchy eyes .   " Will they cure a headache after you 've had too much rum ? " Rogers asked . " I do n't know , " Buell said . " I practically ai n't had any experience with headaches from rum . But they 're great things for rheumatism , toothaches , sore ankles and the itch . There ai n't a case of the itch they wo n't cure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em steady . " " You do n't say ! " Rogers exclaimed . " What 's a pair of ' em worth ? " " Doctor Perkins , who invented ' em , " Buell said , " sold ' em for five guineas a pair , but seeing who you are , I 'll let you have these for three . " Rogers shook his head regretfully . " I ca n't spare that much money , but I 'll trade you for ' em . I see you 're a man who 's interested in inventions , and I 'll trade you an invention I picked up in Newport some years back . This invention is sure death to cockroaches and bedbugs . " " I do n't believe it , " Buell said promptly . " You 'd believe it if you saw it , I suppose , " Rogers said . Buell admitted reluctantly that he would . " All right , " Rogers shouted thickly . " That 's a trade , then ! If my invention kills ' em , you 'll trade me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed , is it ? " " I suppose it is , " Buell said . He seemed suspicious , but somewhat bewildered , perhaps because of the rum he 'd had . " Captain , " Rogers said to Frank James , " there never was a sloop that was n't stocked with bedbugs , and you must have plenty of ' em in your mattress . Get me a fat one , will you ? " James turned over the tiller to me and went below . When , in a few moments , he came back , he held between his thumb and forefinger a fat , struggling , dark-red bedbug . " Hah ! " Rogers cried . " Now we 'll see ! " From his pocket he drew . two pennies . On one he placed the bedbug , and over the insect he placed the second penny . Then he pressed hard ; a snapping sound came from between the coins , and our nostrils were assailed by the unmistakable musty odor of a crushed bedbug . Rogers handed the two coins to Buell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unresisting fingers . " There you are , my boy , " he roared . " There ai n't a cockroach or a bedbug on earth that ca n't be killed with that invention ! " Bellowing with hoarse merriment , he drank deep from his canteen , belched resoundingly , and lowered himself to the deck beside theP229mast . " I 'll just rest my eyes a minute , " he said . He sighed like a tired dog and was instantly asleep . The gray dawn found us snugly tucked against the sandspit that shelters Jamaica Bay from the ocean . How Captain James , on a dark night , found his way between the sedge-grown islets of that pleasant harbor will always be a mystery to me , and perhaps Buell was right when he said James did it by cracking his knuckles and listening for the echo . All through that hot day James kept the three of us out of sight in his cabin . He drew maps of the island for us and put down the location of the homes of influential Loyalists  --  Simonson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hempstead road ; Captain Archibald Hamilton of Flushing ; Doctor Samuel Martin of Hempstead ; Doctor Charles Arden of Jamaica ; David Mathews of Flatbush , mayor of New York . At nightfall he took us ashore , led us along the sand bar to a path through the sedge and started us off on the road that led past Captain Hewlett 's house to Demott 's Mill Pond and Hempstead . Thanks to his diagrams and instructions , we could have drawn a trustworthy map of that part of Long Island with our eyes shut . " You 'll be close onto Hempstead by dawn , " James told us . " Look for the mill at the head of the pond , and if there 's a sheet hanging from an upper window , hide in the swamp . If there ai n't , see the miller , Demott . He 'll send you wherever you want to go . You can always hide by the roadside if you hear anybody coming at night ; and Demott 'll tell you how to travel  --  if you have to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rogers , to see what his plans might be . To my surprise , he was gone . Save for the scent of stale alcohol and tobacco and of sour sweaty leather that clung in my nostrils , I might have thought that the colonel had been nothing but a distorted ghost of a one-time hero . P230DURING our long , dusty walk that night , not a sound did we hear to indicate that we were passing through a part of the countryplentifully populated with rebels and informers constantly at war with their even more numerous Loyalist neighbors  --  and not a sound could any ear have heard from us , for we walked softly in the dust ; and Buell , with his scissors-grinder 's box upon his back , kept his boasted bell in his coat pocket and had muffled the clapper in his big red handkerchief . We saw distant lights while the night was young ; heard the faroilbarking of dogs as we plodded on through thick darkness heavy with the scents of July  --  bayberries , salt marshes , hay fields , barnyards . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an occasional cart creak past , the drivers as silent as dead men . We suspected , from what James had told us , that they were provision carts sent by loyal inhabitants of the island to help feed the fleet behind us . Around three o'clock a sonorous croaking of frogs told us we had reached Demott 's Mill Pond ; and there we waited in the hushes , fighting mosquitoes , until the east grew pale and the blackbirds in the brush along the pond , coming to life with weak chirpings , clambered clumsily up and down the marsh grass as if stricken with rheumatic pains . Buell , peering cautiously above the bushes , was n't satisfied with what he saw . " There 's no sheet hanging on this side of the mill , Oliver , " he said , " but who knows what 's on the other side ? I 'll go see , and do n't you move . You wait here till you hear my bell ringing . That 'll mean there 's no sheets on the other side and that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean everybody in the house is awake , and that you 'll have something to eat as soon as you get there . " He hoisted his scissors-grinder to his shoulder , took his bell by the clapper , and trudged off through the dawn mist toward the dim gray stone building at the head of the pond . Five minutes later , I heard the bell clanging the measured irregularities peculiar to scissors-grinders , and hurried down the road to be with him . When I reached the gate , I found Buell standing in the mill yard , ringing his bell like a man possessed and staring raptly at the brightening eastern sky as a violinist stares into space while wielding his bow . In the open door , tying his apron and staring suspiciously at Buell , was a stout , ruddy man with a pale nose and jowls the color of fresh beef . He scratched his head and looked from Buell to me . Buell suddenly stopped his ringing and pointed his bell abruptly at the miller . " Any scissors to grind ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road pretty early ? " Buell 's bell clanged . " What 's hours got to do with scissors-grinding ? I grind as well in the morning as in the afternoon . Got any scissors to grind ? " The miller still studied us . " Any knives ? " Buell asked patiently . " Any axes , scythes , saws , hatchets , hoes ? Any bayonets to sharpen ? " The miller narrowed his eyes . " How 'd you get here ? By way of New York or across the Sound ? " " What difference does it make ? " Buell asked . " I grind shears and grind ' em well . I sharpen scythes or sickles or anything you 've got . Ai n't you got anything to be sharpened ? " " I might have , " the miller said reluctantly . " How much do you charge ? " Buell looked relieved . " That 's all I wanted to know . " He turned to Inc . " Frank James said if we could satisfy Demott , we could satisfy anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you got for breakfast , Mr. Demott ? " The miller yawned and stretched , at ease for the first time since he 'd seen us . " There ai n't much in the house , " he said , " but I 'll try to ace no friend of Frank James leaves here hungry . You can have hot  --  lc and sour-milk cheese and new bread , and maybe a little sausage and blueberry pie . " " That 's pretty near all we need , Mr. Demott , " Buell said heartily . My digestion ai n't what it ought to be , and personally I ca n't eat more'n half a pie for breakfast , and maybe a dozen sausages . More might give me trouble . " " When 's Howe coming ? " Demott wanted to know before I had a chance to say a word ; and all the members of his household , as we met them , asked the selfsame thing as soon as they learned who we were . Indeed , that was the first question on the tongues of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been harried , spied on , lied about , informed against , robbed and insulted ; and they longed achingly for Howe and his army , so that they might be freed from the oppressions and the restrictions of Congress , mobs and committees . " By God , " Demott said , filling our pewter mugs with steaming ale , " there 's no telling what 'll happen to the people on this island unless Howe gets here pretty quick ! We 're all of us under suspicion , and they ca n't put all of us in jail , the way they have Cadwallader Colden and Judge Jones . The jails are full , and so are the swamps and the brush . I guess they 'll have to kill a lot of us if Howe does n't come pretty quick . " He dropped so heavily into a chair that the floor shook . " How long before the general figures on getting here ? " " Nobody knows , " I said . " His officers think he ought to bring his army across and start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't often do as his officers think he should . " Demott looked stricken . " What 'll become of us ? We ca n't resist unless we 're organized , and we ca n't organize without a central head . That means we 'll be helpless till Howe gets here . " I knew he was suffering from that same miserable feeling of impotence that had oppressed us in Massachusetts when the mobs played hob with us and we had been unable to resist . " He 'll be here eventually , " I said as reassuringly as I could . " After all , you 're no worse off than Loyalists in New England . " Demott sighed . " I suppose not . I suppose we must be even better off , or there would n't be so many Loyalists pouring into Long Island from all the eastern provinces . Scores of ' em cross the Sound every night . That 's one of the things that bothers us . The rebels wo n't take the trouble to send a regiment against a few men hiding in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em in the swamp , they 're worth capturing . There must be fifty Massachusetts Loyalists in that swamp over yonder "  --  he swung a hamlike fist toward the westP233window of the kitchen  --  " and maybe another hundred from Connecticutand Rhode Island , to say nothing of all who 've been hunted out of towns around here by those damned horse thieves the rebels call militia ! " " Have you been in to see how they 're getting along ? " I asked . " Not me , " Demott said , " and do n't you , either  --  not unless you have to ! I guess it ai n't comfortable . I do n't see how they stand it . " He looked reflective . " Of course , it 's probably better than having a mob get hold of you . " " I 'll have to go there , " I said . " The general wants to know what 's happening to ' em . What 's the best way of getting in ? " " There 's only one way , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll show it to you tonight . You 'll have to go in with the night 's crop of Loyalists who come down from the Sound after dark . " " I 'd rather go by myself , " I said , " and this morning . I 've got to talk to those men . The sooner I see ' em , the sooner I can find out what the general wants to know . " " Maybe so , " Demott agreed , " but if the general really needs the information , you 'd better do what I tell you . Otherwise he might not get it  --  and we want him to have the information even more than you do . Look , Mr. Wiswell : there has n't been a day , during the past year , that we 've felt safe . There 's never a morning that we are n't afraid we 'll be hiding in the swamps before night . A year 's a long time , Mr. Wiswell  --  a mighty long time to be at the mercy of any cheap rascal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone he happens to dislike . " Buell helped himself liberally to sour-milk cheese . " Have n't you got enough people to make a gang of your own ? " " Certainly , " the miller said . " This island is three-quarters Loyalist ; but we ca n't do the things the rebels do . They send in militia from other colonies , or bring their mobs from New York . They have no homes here ; no families ; no belongings except what they have on their backs . We have ! If we fight ' em , they seize our cattle , burn our barns and houses , and drive our families across the Sound . I can name hundreds of people , right in this neighborhood , who 've been up to their necks in misery and ruin for over a year , just because they were known to be against rebellion . I hate to think what'sing to happen if the Loyalists of this island ever do somehow contriveto band together and lay hands on the mobs and committeemenat mistreated such men as  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the stairs . " Daniel , Daniel ! Foot soldiers coming around the bend at the lower end of the millpond ! " Demott groaned and struggled to his feet . " Hang out this sheet ! " he shouted . To me he said urgently , " You and your friend better hide in a cornbin in the mill . You can dig down in it and breathe through a tube . " " Not me , " Buell said . " I 'm a peaceable scissors-grinder , and no one can prove different ! " " No cornbin for me , " I said . " I 'll take to the swamp . " " You ca n't ! You do n't know your way around ! You 'd have a bullet through you before night ! Damn it , Mr. Wiswell , ca n't you understand the rebels are trying to capture all those men in the swamps , so they can force ' em into the rebel militia and put ' em to work making forts ? " " I understand , " I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Buell looked indignant . " Plan ? Why did n't you tell me , Oliver ? " " It 's so simple you might not have approved of it . " Buell was disgusted . " You 'd ought to told me , Oliver ! If we get separated  --  " " We wo n't , " I said . " Get outside and sharpen something , or you 'll be in the militia yourself . " He swung his sharpening wheel to his shoulder , snatched a knife from the table and his bell from the floor , ran from the house , and immediately , in the front yard , his bell began to ring and his voice to bellow . To Demott I said , " Give me the use of one of your blankets till the rebels have gone . I need a blanket , a strip of old linen and a lump of suet the size of a robin 's egg ! " Demott stared at me , then ran to the stairs . In his absence I unbuttonedthe knee band of my breeches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen fire and held it close to thc flesh above my knee . Beneath the hot iron the flesh rose in an uglylookingwelt that would soon be a blister . When Demott brought me the blanket , linen and suet , I folded the suet in one end of thc linen , laid it on a hot brick beside the oven until it was melted ; then pressed it over the blister and wrapped the linen around my leg . The soft suet , forced out by the pressure of the bandage , was a dirty , unhealthy white against the flesh . P235As I went into the yard , thus bandaged , Buell rolled an appraising eye at my leg , but kept on with his bellowing and grinding . Approaching us through a haze of dust that overhung the road was a long column of men  --  a slovenly column that marched irregularlyand out of step , so that it had the look of a gigantic centipede whose feet hurt . I lowered myself against the wall of the mill in a sunny spot and spread the blanket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and from it rose a sound of babbling , a kind of chattering such as might come from a cage of animals . At the head of the column , on a sway-backed cart horse with shaggy fetlocks and droopy head , rode a paunchy , red-faced man . He had an upturned nose and little eyes that peered out from between fat lids , and looked surprisingly like a pig on horseback . At a bellowed order from this porcine leader , the long line of men halted and shuffled their feet in the dusty road . There may have been five hundred of them , and they were as scurvy-looking as those citizensoldiers who had stared surlily at my father and me on the night we were driven out of Milton . For the most part they were pockmarked ; their hair hung lankly from under sweat-stained hats ; many were stockingless ; and their coats were patched and foul . Even from where I lay I could hear them cursing purposelessly . As the pig-eyed leader rode into the mill yard , Demott appeared in the doorway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rider , and greeted him heartily as Colonel Birdsall . " What brings you here at this time of day , Colonel ? " he asked . " You know damned well , " Birdsall said . His voice had a squealing resonance something like that of a sow impatiently crying out for food . " I 'm after the damned Tories hiding in this swamp ; and I think you know a good way in , Demott ! " Demott was indignant . " I 'm a law-abiding citizen , Colonel ! You 've never had trouble with me , and you never will ! It 'd be as much as my life is worth to do anything for a Tory . No , Colonel , I 'm hiding no Tories ! " Birdsall yelped contemptuously . " Fah ! You ca n't live on the edge of this swamp and not know what goes on in it ! Do you deny there 's Loyalists hiding in here ? " His little deep-set eyes roamed to Buell and nic . Buell , seemingly uninterested in the fat colonel , pedaled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flew from the edge of the knife blade on which he worked . The colonel leveled a stumpy forefinger at him . " You , there ! You ai n't a native of these parts ! Where you from ? What you doing here ? " Buell ceased pedaling , ran his thumb over the knife blade , and held it , point first , toward the colonel . " Me ? " he asked . " Why , I ai n't doing nothing ! I 'm just sharpening this knife . " " I can see that , " Birdsall said . " What I ca n't see 's where you 're from . You do n't belong here , and I want to know how you got here . " " I 'm from Massachusetts , " Buell said , " which ai n't no place for an honest scissors-grinder . " " Why not ? " " Because there ai n't anything left to sharpen in Massachusetts . They sharpened up all their axes , hatchets and bayonets for the British five years ago . Why , Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bell all the way , and not get more'n two knives to sharpen ! What 's your trade , brother , when you ai n't a soldier ? " " Who , me ? " the colonel asked . " I 'm a drover . " " Well , " Buell said , " how 'd you like it if you drove a lot of cows all through this province and never found a butcher to take ' em off your hands ? You would n't like it , would you ? " " Beef ai n't knives , " Birdsall said . " People have to have beef , but they can sharpen their own knives . What you say do n't explain nothing ! What brought you here ? " " Why , Colonel , " Buell said , " everyone in Massachusetts knows folks on Long Island are whetting their knives for each other . When I heard all you people were just waiting for a chance to cut each other 's throats , I hurried right over here to get some of the trade . I figured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they ought to be helped to do a good clean job . As a drover , you 've had dealings with butchers , and you know that 's plain ordinary horse sense . " The colonel looked doubtful , but kicked his mare in the ribs and moved over to stand above me . " Who 's this ? Demott , who 's this ? He 's another stranger ! By God , Demott , you claim you do n't know what 's going on in that swamp ; yet there 's always a stranger or two around your house  --  someone who ca n't account for himself . Who is this man ? " I spoke up in a voice of high complaint . " Colonel , I 'll tell you who I am , and what 's more , I think it 's your duty and the duty of every compassionate man who hates King George to do something forp237me . . . . Even this miller here grudges to let me lie on his ground ! If you want to know where I 'm from , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would n't let me stay aboard . " Birdsall made a squealing protest . " You 're a damned fool if you think I 'll believe that ! You do n't catch Ben Birdsall believing it ! British surgeons may not know how to take care of their sick , but they generally pretend they do ! " He leaned from his horse and poked me with the switch he carried . " What 's the matter with you , you damned ministerial tool ! " I rose on one elbow . " Only a little sore on my leg that does n't amount to anything . " " Sore ? A little sore ? What kind of a little sore ? You mean to say the doctors on your ship drove you off because you had a little sore ? Let 's look at it ! " I threw back the blanket from my leg . Above and below the bandagewere scaly white excrescences , extremely unhealthy-looking . " Hm , " the colonel said . " What 's the matter with it ? That ought n't to bother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they say it was ? " I covered my leg and looked around me in what I hoped was a hunted manner . " I do n't believe they knew , " I said . " Gammon ! " Birdsall cried . " Either they knew or they did n't ! Speak up ! What did they call it ? " " Well , sir , " I said , " I do n't think it 's true . I 've never been anywhere a man could get it . I do n't think it 's true that I 've got it ! " " By God ! " Birdsall whispered . " Leprosy ! " He reined back his horse . " Was that what they told you you had ? Leprosy ? " I swallowed and tried to groan realistically . " No , Colonel ! No ! They did n't say so ! They did n't come right out with the word , anyhow ! " " Demott , " Birdsall shouted , " get this man away from here ! Give him a bag of potatoes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from this neighborhood or I 'll burn your mill ! " He urged his clumsy cart horse to a trot ; and as he shouted orders to his line of scarecrow troops , he repeatedly looked back over his shoulder at me in a way that was a tribute to my blister and the sincerity of my acting . From a distance we watched Birdsall send flanking parties of militiamen around the swamp ; faintly heard his bellowing voice ordering other parties to go straight in .   " Dead or alive ! " we heard him shouting . " Drive ' em out dead or alive ! . . . Dead or alive ! " All through the morning and the early afternoon we heard faroffshouts and shots  --  single detonations ; ripples of musketry fire ; then long silences , during which I pictured sullen , sunken-cheeked militiamen prowling from bush to bush in that dark and watery swamp , to stalk fellow countrymen as they 'd have stalked wild animals . Toward sundown they came out again , hallooing and cursing , splashed with mud and scratched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they told Demott exultantly , killed one and taken three prisoners . The hunted Loyalists , they said , had run from them like water rats ; but how many there were , or why the rest had escaped , they were unable to say . Before that night was over we found out for ourselves . P239W E LAY in the brush behind the mill until Birdsall and his men went shouting down the road ; and when they had gone , the whole world  --  except for the diapason of sound from innumerable frogs  --  seemed empty of life . But Demott had told Buell and me to stay where he 'd put us in the scrub behind the mill ; and so we waited , with the scent of bayberry coming to us in waves , as though this war-tormented island sighingly sought our sympathy . Not until ten o'clock did we hear stirrings and faint tappings above the all-pervasive frog chorus , and soon thereafter we saw a lantern swing in circles near the darkened mill . That was the signal for which we waited , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dim figures standing there in silence . Demott himself was n't among them , and when one of his womenfolkcame out with a lantern shrouded in a bag , I remembered with what obvious sincerity Demott had sworn to Birdsall that he had never seen a Loyalist in the swamp . Without a word being spoken , the woman turned her back upon the mill and walked into the darkness . Buell and I followed her , and one by one so did the blurred figures that had been waiting . She led us upon a path that constantly grew softer and wetter , and when she slipped the bag from her lantern and waved it , we saw , far ahead , a yellow pin point of light . As we drew closer , the pin point became a lantern , held by a cadaverous tall man whose breeches clung to his bony legs as if he 'd been wading waist-high in a river . He stood in the stern of a sedge boat  --  one of the flat-bottomed square-ended craft used by Long Islanders for transporting hay crops and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the swampy shore of the black stream were five other sedge boats , in the stern of each of which sat a hollow-cheeked man peering intently and suspiciously at us . Across their knees lay short-barreled muskets . " How many ? " the man with the lantern asked , and without waiting for an answer he added , " Did you get the medicine ? Did you get the bandages ? " Our woman guide spoke up . " I got two sheets and a pail of mutton tallow , " she said . " It 'll have to do . " The man groaned . " Bring rags tomorrow if you ca n't get sheets . We could use six sheets . Bring cinchona bark , too . The fever 's bad . " The woman pushed me forward . " This here 's Mr. Wiswell , " she said . " Dan says you 're to take special care of him , because he came over from Staten Island to find out what 's happening to you . " " From Staten Island ? " the man repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he suddenly changed . His eyes glittered ; his emaciated limbs seemed to strengthen and take on more substance ; he stood straighter . " He came from Staten Island ? " he cried . " When 's Howe coming ? " " Soon , " I said , " soon ! Soon , I think . " At that the man groaned . " Soon ! ' That 's all we 've heard for the past six months ! Well , get in , Mr. Wiswell , and your friend too . How many in all ? " " There 's eighteen , " the woman said . " All forwarded and vouched for by Mayor Mathews . " Our half-seen company entered the sedge boats with a sound of thumpings and splashing . I found myself seated in two inches of water smelling strongly of fish ; and behind me sat Buell , growling at the difficulty of keeping his scissors-grinder dry . The man set his lantern on the back thwart , picked up an oar and pushed his boat away from the bank . Facing backward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swamp ; and behind us the other sedge boats , each with a dim lantern in its stern , followed around sharp turns and through sedgy passageways like a sluggish and dimly phosphorescent marsh monster phlegmatically traversing familiar waters . We seemed to float on a river of drumlike rumbling  --  a frog chorus so vast that it had a sort of solidity . We moved , too , in a dense cloud of insects whose wings made a constant shrill whining accompaniment to the resonant song of the frogs . Those damnable bugs were like dust or smoke , and filtered through every aperture , no matterp241how small . When I opened my eyes , they dashed against my eyeballs . When I opened my mouth , it was filled with their fluttering wings . They were in my nose , ears , hair  --  down my neck , up my sleeves ; and I felt them crawling far down inside my clothes . They pierced me with little hot itching thrusts , with slow malignant bites , with sharp vindictive stabs . When I brushed them from one part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me beyond endurance . " You 'll get used to ' em , " the boatman said . " You got nice rich blood , and if there 's anything those critters like , it 's fresh meat ! When they 've sucked a few quarts out of you , you 'll be like the rest of us , and they wo n't bother you so much . Where you from , Mr. Wiswell ? " " Milton , " I said , " but for the last three months I 've been in Halifax with General Howe . " The boatman spoke explosively . " What 's he waiting for ! For God 's sake , why do n't he come ! Does he want to find us all dead when he gets here ? " " I think he wants to be sure nothing goes wrong , " I said . " He 's waiting for his brother , the admiral , and the fleet from England . " " By God , " the boatman said , " we would n't need him or his brother or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that knew how to fight ! " He spat violently in the water , and a bullet would have made less of an impact . He poled onward , silent for a time . Then he said , " We 've got some Boston men in here with us . They say Massachusetts committees are seizing the property of everybody that left their homes , and selling it for next to nothing to those the rebels favor . They say Sam Adams figures on having all you Massachusetts folks banished for good ; proscribed , too , so you can be shot in a hurry in case you take it into your head to go back . This General Howe , he 'd better not waste much more time . " " Banished and proscribed ? " Indiscreetly I laughed aloud ; and the opening of my mouth filled it with those horrible bugs . I sputtered them out . " Are n't we banished and proscribed enough already ? " The boatman slapped his sculling oar . " Now I come to think of it , one of those Massachusetts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , same as you . He asked two or three times if we 'd heard of anyone named Wiswell . Yes , sir , that was the name : Wiswell ! Could it ' a ' been you he was asking about , Mr. Wiswell ? " Hope shot up within me , as smoldering leaves burst into flame ; then died again . Would I hear something of Sally  --  even somethingP242from her ? No , I would n't ! After what had happened to me in the past year , I knew more than to hope . The whole world , in the words of that gay old song , was turned upside down . Nothing could come out right . I only grunted in answer to the boatman and settled myselfdown into the wetness in which I sat . The Aristophanes chorus of croaking was a solid sound all about us , dimming all other senses except the afflicted one of hearing , till I croaked grotesquely myself , in protest , " Hold your tongues , you damned frogs ! Ca n't you be quiet just an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment the marsh before us was as black as the bottom of a well ; the next moment the boatman sharply turned us against a wall of sedge , thrust hard , and we passed rustling through tall grasses and came into a pool on the far side of which blinked scores of lights , like fireflies above a meadow . A dozen smudges smoldered among those flitting lights , and smoke from them lay in a dimly seen blanket above our heads . As the lantern in our boat cleared the wall of sedge behind us , an eager babbling arose from the shore and I had the singular and unexpected feeling that here was a haven in which I would be both safe and welcome . Individual voices came clearer to me from among those moving lights . " What about Howe ? " " Any troops landed yet ? " " When 's Howe coming ? " The boatman flourished his sculling oar . " The general 's sent a man to see us , " he cried . " I got him here  --  here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispering like that of dead leaves on an autumn night . With a sharp twist of his sculling oar the boatman drove the nose of our little craft onto dry land , and I found myself looking up into a semicircle of gaunt faces . The light of many lanterns showed eye sockets black and bearded cheeks hollow , so that these hunted creatures had the look of dead men standing upright  --  yet all the eyes glittered with the hope that my coming brought . As I stepped ashore , I heard the boatman ask , " Where 's the judge ? " heard someone say , " They 're bringing him down . " Buell climbed from the boat , swung his scissors-grinder after him , put it down behind him and sat upon it . I heard the other boats grate against the sedge bank ; heard their boatmen muttering orders ; felt their occupants moving up the bank and coming to a halt behindP243me ; but still that half-circle of hollow-eyed men stood like a wall before us . " You do n't suppose , do you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that these people do n't want us around here ? Maybe we ought to go back and tell Howe there ai n't any use trying to find out what 's happening to Loyalists on Long Island . " A sharp voice answered . " If you 're the man General Howe sent to us , you 're welcomer than ice to hell ; but nobody gets into this swamp without we know who he is . Judge Hendon has to talk to each man . If you 'd ever had a mob after you , you 'd know why . " " Brother , " Buell said , " I 've had more tar on me than you could get on a barn roof . " The circle of men swayed and muttered . From far behind them we heard a commotion and shouting . The shouting proved to be one sentence , oft-repeated : " Make way for the judge ! Make way for the judge ! " The half-circle opened , and through the lane thus formed came two men carrying a third who sat in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put down , the half-circle closed behind it , and the two bearers stood on either side , with lanterns raised shoulderhigh . Our boatman stepped forward . " Judge , " he said , " this here 's a Mr. Wiswell , vouched for by Demott . He and a friend want to find out what 's happening here , so they can take back word to General Howe . " The judge was a frail old man with white hair and a thin ascetic face ; but I could see he was seriously an invalid , for he was obviously unable to rise from his chair , and his hands were twisted as if his lingers had been bound against his palms for a long , long time , until they were stiffened and useless . His eyes , however , were quick and young , and his voice was as gentle as his smile . " We 're honored to have you here , Mr. Wiswell , " he said , " and we welcome you and your friend  --  I do n't believe I heard your friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briskly . " Thomas Buell , printer , repairer of militaryarms ; maker of fashionable ornaments for military caps and cartridge boxes ; painter and gilder of escutcheons ; engraver of seals , dies , punches and copper plates ; marker of silver plate with elegant ciphers and arms ; cutter of blocks and ornaments for printers ; maker of models for canal locks , paint-grinding mills , ma- chines for cutting and polishing crystals and precious stones ; agent for Perkins ' Metallic Tractors , claimed by Doctor Elisha Perkins of Norwich , Connecticut , to be a sure cure for rheumatism , gout , black spots before the eyes , dizziness and the itch . " The judge stared contemplatively at Buell . " Indeed ! Indeed , Mr. Buell ! I 'm a sufferer from rheumatism myself . Am I to understand that you know of metallic substances that will cure me ? " " Not me , Judge , " Buell said promptly . " Those Metallic Tractors ai n't good for one damned thing  --  except to prove that anyone who believes in ' em is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer , the judge turned back to me . " Your home is in Boston , Mr. Wiswell ? " " Milton , " I said . " I lived in Boston a year after we were driven from our house . " " I had great respect for a gentleman of your name , Mr. Wiswell , " the judge said . " Perhaps you 're related to him . I refer to Mr. Seaton Wiswell . " " My father , " I said . " He  --  he  --  " I could n't go on . The unexpected mention of my father 's name by this kind old judge , the presence of this distinguished and harmlessgentleman , bent and crippled with rheumatism , in a mosquitoriddenswamp , the hollow eyes and sodden , tattered garments of all those men before me , tightened my throat so that I could neither speak nor draw a full breath . The judge 's eyes darted over the men who stood behind me , then came back to mine again . " I 'll expect you later in my hut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat restricted in our hospitality ; but we can offer you loyalty and friendship . That 's something in these troubled days , as you 've doubtless learned by now . " When we moved aside , the refugees who had accompanied us in the sedge boats came up one by one to offer their credentials . How , the judge asked each one , had he come to Long Island ? With whom had he come ? Where had he landed and when ? To whom had he gone , and who had told him to go there ? By what road had he traveled to Hempstead ? Where had he stopped on the way ? Had he seen any rebel militia ? Having satisfied himself about such details , he went deeper into each man 's life . Where was he born ? Where had he lived before coming to Long Island ? Why had he decided to leave his home ? Had the rebels attempted to persuade him to join their party ? P245On learning where each man lived , Judge Hendon summoned from among the onlookers someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to ask questions of the newcomer . Our boatman , standing at our shoulders , enlightened us in a hoarse whisper . " The judge tripped up three of ' em last week . Rebel spies , they were . " " What happened to them ? " I asked . The boatman looked surprised . " They 're still here . You 'd ought a talk to ' em about how things are . They get better food and more of it than the rest of us . Of course , we ca n't let ' em get away , because if we did , they 'd show the rebels how to get at us , and we would n't last long . " The stories that the judge drew from the men who had come with us from Demott 's were in all likelihood not different from scores of those I had heard in Boston ; yet their simplicity made them seem new and horrible . Thomas French had been seized by Birdsall 's mob on Long Island , sent across the Sound and put in Simsbury Mines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been caught under water and drowned . Edward Beekman of Norwich , Connecticut , had been tarred and feathered and the sight of one eye destroyed . Charles Holcomb of Worcester , for daring to urge his neighbors not to take up arms until all other methods of reconciliationhad failed , had been chained to a cart and driven over rocky roads until something inside him burst and he was left for dead beside the road . Arthur Downs of Stonington , charged with helping Loyalists seek sanctuary on Long Island , had been towed to sea in his sloop , his sloop scuttled , and he left to drown or get to shore by long swimming . Edward Johnson of Kingston , New York , for trying to lighten the lot of Loyalists sent to the jail in that town , had been hoisted halfway up a liberty pole by the heels , left there all night , and lowered as dead in the morning . When the last man had spoken , the silent audience moved restlessly ; and its whisperings were like a prolonged hiss of anger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kingston J:ill , " he said . " Were n't several gentlemen from this part of Long Island sent to Kingston Jail ? " " I only heard about one , " Johnson said . " He 's the one that got me into trouble  --  Governor Colden . They had him in a room with five other men . The rebel militia stole his coat , so he did n't have anything but breeches and shirt , and he got the fever and had to sleep on a stone floor without coverings . They did n't give him any medicines or even enough drinking water , and I just could n't see an old man like the governor , who 'd never done anybody any harm , treated like that . I took him some clothes and medicines , and a blanket and a mattress , and on that account they burned down my store and I heard they were going to put me in Simsbury Mines ; but I did n't propose to rot away in that hole in the ground , so I came here . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " was Governor Colden treated worse than other Loyalists in Kingston Jail ? " " Oh no , sir , " Johnson said . " Some were treated worse ; lots worse ! Some had all their clothes stolen , and wore flour sacks . There 's a fever room in the jail , and when a man gets fever , he 's put in it with a pan of potatoes beside him . That 's all he gets to eat . If he does n't have the strength to eat , he does n't get anything . " " Are they allowed to have exercise  --  permitted to walk in the town ? " the judge asked . " My goodness , . no ! " Johnson said . " If they were let out , half the womenfolk in town 'd give ' em clothes and food . That ai n't allowed ! Folks that are such skunks as to want peace and the right to speak their minds should n't get food and clothes ! No , sir ; they sit right there in their little coffins of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winter ! By God , Judge , ca n't something be done to get our people out of Kingston Jail and all the rest of the jails to the eastward ? " His voice shook and became shrill . " They have n't done a damned thing , Judge ; not one damned thing ! There 's an awful lot of mighty fine men in Kingston Jail , Judge ! Ca n't something be done for ' cm ? " " Possibly , " the judge said cautiously . " We 'll hope for the best . Meanwhile , try not to bear malice . I want all you newcomers to make yourselves useful . You 'll be helped to get settled , and you 'll be expected to help us in return . Sometimes one of the most valuable things you can give us is cheerfulness . If only we can have that , we 'll contrive to endure what we must . " He motioned to his chair bearers , who picked him up . The silent audience separated to let him through , and we moved slowly after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowded half-circle dispersed , I began to have an idea of the size of the company that dwelt within this swamp . Scores of dark figures , dimly seen in the lantern light , moved before me ; and as we walked beside the judge 's swaying chair , I could see them carrying their lanterns to little huts built in the brush beyond the open parade across which we moved . The parade was crowded , like Boston Common on a Saturday night . They seemed a different breed from Colonel Birdsall 's militia  --  more alert , more determined , more resourceful . " It would n't be difficult , would it , Judge , " I asked , " to defeat a regimentof rebels with these men here ? " " No , " Judge Hendon said , " it would n't ! You have n't met the young men who are kind enough to act as my chair bearers . The one in front is Stephen DeLancey . His uncle 's General Oliver DeLancey . The one behind is John Barbarie . John and Stephen say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobs , cowards at heart . They think they can train the men in this swamp to whip ten times their number of rebels ; but I ca n't permit it , Mr. Wiswell . There 's no doubt these men have the quality and the determination to whip Birdsall and Duyckinck , but they 'd never be able to protect the thousands of unarmed , unorganized Loyalists on Long Island . " " Those damned rebels splash around like a lot of pigs , " Barbarie said . " They talk like pigs and smell like pigs , too . If Stephen and I 'd been free this afternoon , we could have killed twenty of ' em without firing a gun  --  the way you 'd kill pigs . " " Yes , and gained nothing by it , " Judge Hendon said sharply . " Dead men help no one , not even those who kill them ! " He leaned forward and spoke to Stephen DeLancey . " We 'd best go by way of the hospital , Stephen . " DeLancey bore to the right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with leafy boughs , but without sides . On each corner post hung a lantern , and by this faint light I saw a score of figures lying on beds of leaves . They were covered with tattered blankets , bed ticking , flour bags , old coats . A few lay silent , staring up at the leafy branches overhead ; others tossed and turned , sighing and groaning . " The rebels do all they can to keep us from getting medicines , " the judge said . " They aim either to kill us , or capture us and force us into the rebel militia ; but it seems as though our men just wo n't die till Howe gets here to set us free . " A dark figure rose from his knees at the far end of the long hut and came toward us . " Judge , " he said , " we 've got to have more men to take care of these people . They 're being eaten alive by mosquitoes , and their fevers ca n't be kept down . Bonner just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't have another ten men to trickle water on ' em and keep off the mosquitoes . " " Bonner , " the judge said thoughtfully . " He got here just yesterday , did n't he ? Was n't he the one who was going to be married next week ? " The doctor looked doubtful . " Maybe so . He had five buckshot in the small of his back , and another lodged in his skull . " He gave us a quick glance ; then said to the judge : " When 's Howe coming ? " The judge seemed not to hear him . " This is Doctor Rounds of Islip , Mr. Wiswell . The rebels drove away eighteen horses belonging to the doctor , and obliged his wife and his daughters to take refuge in New Jersey . It 's hard on the doctor , Mr. Wiswell ; but it 's our good fortune . Probably half of us would be dead if we did n't have him to look after us . " He touched young DeLancey . " Take me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those ten men for the doctor . " To the doctor he added , " Come to my hut when you 've made your men comfortable for the night . I 'll have Mr. Wiswell with me , and we 'll be even more eager to hear what he has to say than he 'll be to talk to us . " As we moved out to the open space , the judge repeated name after name to DeLancey , who snapped them out in a voice that must , I thought , be audible on Staten Island . That clone , the judge took us to his own hut , which , like the hospitaland all the other shelters , was nothing but a roof of branchesp249supported by four tree trunks . To my surprise , the hut already had an occupant , and it had a ready-made audience too ; for on every side of it sat and stood scores of Loyalists , their eyeballs white in the lantern light ; and their hands , perpetually brushing at mosquitoes , made a pale flickering , as of a half-moonlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair beside the occupant of the hut , who was lying on a thick mat of sedge . In the light of the lanterns his thin face had a waxy pallor , but his black eyes sparkled and his lips were curved in a smile that was both patient and sardonic . The judge leaned clown and looked at him , seemed reassured by what he saw ; then said to me , " This is the Reverend Edmund Lane , Mr. Wiswell . One of these days he 'll be a bishop , but we almost lost him this afternoon , because he thought the rebels would n't shoot their own countrymen . We took four buckshot out of his shoulder . " Lane moved his hand in a small gesture that took in all the men outside the hut . " They 've come here for news , Judge . You 'd betterarrange to give it to them , or they 'll stand around all night , wait-ing . " The judge turned to me . " Mr. Wiswell , have you any information for us in regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to move to our relief ? " " No , " I said , and I spoke loudly , so that I might be heard at a considerable distance . " I 'm sorry . I 'm not a carrier of information , but a seeker for it . I do n't know the general 's plans , or how long he may be delayed before attacking . My instructions are only to find out your numbers and the conditions under which you live , and report on ' em to the general . " I heard voices muttering in disappointment , and then , after a moment or two , the word " Declaration " . It was repeated from here and there , " Declaration , Declaration , " until it became a general insistentoutcry . " Declaration ! Declaration ! " The judge looked at me apologetically . " We 've all heard Congress issued a Declaration of Independence a short time ago , but nobody can tell us what was in it . Can you , by any chance , tell us what it 's bout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I can give you a general idea . I ca n't recite it for ou ; but two sentences stick in my mind and I can say ' em for you word for word . Every Loyalist , almost , knows its first sentencehen in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another , and to assume , among the powers of the earth , the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature 's God entitle them , a decent respect to the opinions of mankindrequires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation . ' " Somewhere among the close-packed circle of listeners a man laughed abruptly , and the laughter spread as a ripple progresses upon the surface of a pool . Judge Hendon raised his hand and the laughter died away . " Do you know who wrote the paper ? " he asked . " Thomas Jefferson , I 'm told , sir . " The judge nodded . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did you not ? When it becomes necessary for one people . ' " He made an exasperatedmovement . " Four fifths of the people on this island are loyal . Two thirds of the people in New York and Pennsylvania are loyal . More than half the people in all of North America are loyal . It looks to me as though Mr. Jefferson has n't a high respect for the opinions of mankind  --  not if he wants mankind to think that I , and all the others who have fled to the security of this swamp , and another million of our fellow countrymen , are not people . " " You 'll be equally interested in the other sentence , " I said . " It reads , We hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights , that among these are life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness . ' " " Well , well ! " Judge Hendon said . " So all men are created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness ! " He shook his head . " I suppose we , in this swamp , are supposed to be in possession of our liberty , and engaged in the pursuit of happiness , since Mr. Jefferson declares them to be our unalienable rights . " An angry muttering rose from the crowd of listeners . The Reverend Mr. Lane raised a protesting hand . " No profanity , please ! Model yourselves on Judge Hendon . Do n't make matters worse by speaking indiscreetly or with improper heat . " " Oh my , no ! " Buell said . " When the neighbors tar and feather you , do n't ever call ' em anything worse than the said neighbors ' . If you get too hot about it , you can relieve yourself with whereas ' and feloniously ' . Like this : Whereas the said neighbors did feloniouslyp251tar and feather my aforesaid hide , including my aforesaid hair , my said nose and aforesaid fingernails , therefore know all men ' , and so on . Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I went on hastily . " Those two sentences are the only ones I can quote exactly , but the document speaks of the abuses suffered by residents of North America at England 's hands . It says that the King of England has refused his assent to wholesome laws , and plans the establishment of absolute tyranny over these states . " " That 's not so , " Judge Hendon said . " No colony has ever been prevented from making any law it wished . The only thing they have n't been allowed to do is to issue fraudulent currency and declare it legal tender . Can you give us a better example of royal tyranny and brutality , Mr. Wiswell ? " " Well , sir , " I said , " the document says the King has called together legislative bodies , at places unusual , uncomfortable , and distant from the depository of their public records , for the sole purpose of fatiguing the Patriots into a compliance with his measures ! " " Yes , " the judge said meditatively , " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Boston to Cambridge so the legislators might be protected against mobs . I find myself strangely lacking in sympathy for Patriots who admit they can be ' fatigued ' into complying with measures of which they disapprove ! I fear it 's a feeble and sickly patriotism that wilts before such dreadfulhardships as undertaking the long , long journey between Boston and Cambridge ! I do n't much care for it as an argument justifying a national rebellion against constituted authority and embarking on a civil war ! " Every man without that hut was now as silent as though carved from stone . " Another abuse mentioned , " I said , " is that the King has erected a multitude of new offices , and sent swarms of officers to harass our people and eat out their subsistence . " The judge looked irritated . " Five new commissioners were appointedfor this whole country , and fifteen or twenty clerks to go with them . Those are the swarms who harass Americans and eat out their subsistence ! How do they compare with the packs of rebel militia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the lives of our womenfolk a perpetual nightmare ! " Well , sir , " I said , " the paper says America is opposing with anly firmness the King 's invasions on the rights of the people . "  | " Since when , " judge Hendon asked , " has a government been able to maintain its integrity without putting down rebellion and mob rule ? All these so-called measures of repression were provoked by popular outrage ! Does n't this document anywhere hint that a governmentmust protect its officers from assault and their houses from being sacked , its loyal lieges from being tarred and feathered , and the property of merchants sailing under its flags from being thrown by lawless hands into the sea ? " " No , sir , " I said . He raised his crippled hands in a half gesture of disgust . " I 've heard enough ! From the beginning , twelve years ago , the rebellious agitators against England have consistently disavowed any desire for independence . For twelve long years the rebel leaders have solemnly affirmed and reiterated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministerial policy , thereby to secure a redress of grievances . At every opportunity they vowed they abhorred the thought of independence ! James Otis , Alexander Hamilton , George Washington , John Dickinson  --  all of them said independence would be a calamity and a crime . On this ground they secured the help of Pitt , Burke , Conway , Barre . Now they 've turned traitor to those who helped them . Pitt , Burke and all the others have been made parties to a disruption of the British Empire . The men responsible for this Declaration are political hypocrites , as those of us who disagreewith them have always charged . While openly disavowing a wish for independence , some of them must have been treacherously working with that end in view all the time ! " He leaned forward in his chair . " Take word to General Howe for us , Mr. Wiswell , that the rebels are in a position where they must be utterly destroyed if they 're attacked soon . Our country is at stake , Mr. Wiswell . The war these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because without it neither their freedom nor their happiness would be impaired or imperiled . In this colony , which is overwhelmingly loyal , rebellion was instigated and made inevitable by three lawyers  --  all demagogues and unscrupulous users of cunning chicanery and falsehood : the uncouth , bigoted , savage , violent , sullen William Livingston ; the sycophantic hypocrite William Smith , Junior , who unhesitatingly sacrifices friendship , honor , religion or his sacred word to pride , ambition or avarice ; and a violent and acrimonious madman , John Morin Scott ; by a liquor dealer and son of a convict , John Lamb ; by a slop-shop keeper , Alexander Mc/Dougall ; by a **35;6231;TOOLONG , Isaac Sears ; by a bail-jumper and a coward at Quebec under fire , Donald Campbell ; by Peter Livingston , whose low cunning and avarice have earned him the name of Jew Peter . " If these men have their way with us , the population , instead of employing themselves in peaceful occupations , will engage in costly and endless struggles for political offices and grants from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the voices of worthy and modest men will seldom be heard ; the bold , the ambitious , the artful will hold sway . Alcibiades will rule and Socrates will be martyred , as the Smiths proposed to martyr Doctor Myles Cooper , president of King 's College , by shaving his head , slitting his nose , stripping him naked and turning him adrift ! Themistocles , Xenophon and Aristides will be banished ; great Pericles will be fined and his sons put to death when laurels should be their reward . Our futures and our lives depend on leadership , Mr. Wiswell . That 's the word we want taken back to General Howe . " Judge Hendon , his twisted hands held tight against his breast , stared into the steamy darkness of the swamp with the rapt gaze of a prophet . The Reverend Mr. Lane sighed . " Put out the lanterns , " he told Barbarie and DeLancey , " and have someone cut green grass for the smudges . We need all the blood we 've got if Birdsall and his men take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dim , silent figures moved slowly away . A black depression weighed me down . My thoughts and fears must have come out from me like a dark loud , for the judge said : " Remember , Mr. Wiswell , nothing 's ever hopeless as it seems  --  not even death . You might tell General owe that no matter what happens to us , we 'll never lose courage . " He looked up suddenly . " Who 's that ? " A voice spoke from the darkness beyond the hut . " Eben Drake of Milton , Judge . I 'd like a word with Mr. Wiswell . " I did n't wait to hear what the judge said , but darted from the hut ward the dark figure standing outside . " Are you one of the Drakes m Brush Hill Road ? " I asked , and in spite of myself my voice pok . ' I certainly am , " he said . " I worked in Vose Leighton 's store , Mr. well . I had to leave because my uncle Robie worked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything to do with the Chandlers was driven out , Mr. Wiswell . The Chandlers had too much money . " " I know , " I said . " Were the Leightons well when you left ? How was Soame ? How was Mrs. Leighton and the other boys ; how was  --  how was  --  how were they all ? " " I du n no , damn ' em , " Drake said . " They 're in the army  --  the rebel army ; and I hope they get their come-uppance ! There ai n't but one in the whole damned family I 'd turn my hand over for , and she 's why I wanted to see you . She thought you might come to Long Island sooner or later , so she gave me the money to get here  --  and this for you . " He gave me a little damp wad of paper , uncertainly said , " Well  --  " and drifted away in the darkness . I hurried back to the hut and , with trembling hands , rekindled one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the ink upon it almost illegible from innumerable wettings and dryings . I was conscious , as I scrutinized the faded writing , that Judge Hendon , Mr. Lane and Buell were watching me when I put the precious document on the top of Buell 's scissors-grinder to steady it , and as I held the lantern close above those blurred words , Buell tried to take it from me . " You 'll spill the oil out of that lamp , Oliver , " he said , " and first thing you know you wo n't have any letter at all . Why do n't you let me read it for you ? I 've had practice reading messy writing . " " I can read it without assistance , " I said . " Oh , private matter , " Buell said , and added slowly , " I see , I see . " The others also seemed to see ; for they ceased to stare at me , and I had the letter to myself . I made out the words " Dearest Oliver . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had seemed a hopeless blur became readable . " Dearest Oliver , " she had written " Two weeks ago 1 had a beautifulexperience . I 'd just stepped out of our gate upon the road when a strange man , all the color of dust , came from some bushes across the way , where he seemed to have been lurking . At first I was a little afraid of him , because there was no one else in sight ; but his manner was respectful and he touched his ragged hat . He asked me if my name was n't Sally Leighton ; and when I told him Yes , he spoke to me quickly in a low voice and said , There 's a friend of yours whosep255name begins with 0 , and he asked me to tell you that he was well and hopeful , and to say that nothing 's changed or ever will be . ' He was gone down the road before I could utter a word in answer ; but oh , Oliver , I knew you 'd sent it  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me I 've lived in sunlight ever since I saw the dust-colored man ! You must n't write to me , remember ; but , oh , perhaps there 'll he another dust-colored man some day ? " How often , oh , how often have I wished to write you during all these long , cold months ; and how often have I longed for word from you . Now spring is here , and every scene and scent and sound reminds me of spring days we spent together. " 1 have never seen such vast flocks of Old Shags flying north : there have been thousands and thousands , in long lines , like those we saw the day we sailed to Hingham and caught the eels and made the stew . Father says this means we shall have a hot summer . Probably so , because there have been rings around the sun for two weeks , and never a drop of rain . " The willows along the river in Dedham smell like honey , Oliver . Do you remember the day you put the mouse on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the sulky big trout lay , and how we thought he 'd swallowed the shingle when he struck ? " Of course you remember Pie Benjamin , the town idiot ? He stood outside our house every day for eight days , making whirling motions around his ears with his forefinger , and then I remember that either you or your father had always given him a shilling every spring so he could have his winter hair cut off . I was deeply touched that he should have come to me , and I gave him a shilling for you , Oliver . " Albion , Soame , Steven , Jeremiah and John have gone south with their regiments . Everybody says that the British are about to leave /Halifax , or have already left . It 's common talk that they 're going to Long Island  --  that all their sympathizers are going with them . That 's why I 'm sending this letter by Eben Drake . He knows you because he worked in . Father 's store for six years , and saw you often . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for if you 're as eager to have a word from me as I am to hear from you , you 'll be glad jar it . " I wonder , dear Oliver , whether you know all the things that our rave army has learned . I am sure that if you knew the cruel things our associates have been guilty of , you would have a change of heart . he Ministry is arousing the black slaves of the south to attack us ,  | and employing savages to make uncivilized war upon our frontiers . The Ministry has sent Hessian mercenaries to butcher us . These hirelingshave been told that if they allow themselves to be captured by Americans , their bodies will be stuck full of pine splinters and then slowly burned to cinders . Was anything ever more horrible , Oliver ? " Oh , my dear ! I can write no more ; but you will understand and hear me crying out to you  --  see all the words that rest unwritten in my heart . Dear , dear Oliver , I 'm your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time as a child reads a tale , seekingthe passages that delight him . She had longed for word from me ! She thought often of me ! She still was my Sally ! I drew a deep breath and read the letter again ; and this time phrases came out from it and struck upon me with hammers : " you would have a change of heart " , " cruel associates " , " arousing the black slaves of the south " , " see all the words that rest unwritten in my heart " . When , for the third time , I read the letter through , I seemed to he in a fog of puzzlement . Buell touched my arm . " Do n't you hear the judge speaking to you , Oliver ? " " My apologies , sir , " I said . " I  --  I did n't hear . " " You 've had troublesome news , Mr. Wiswell , " the judge said . " Is there anything I can do ? " I fear I spoke brusquely . " Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a person does n't see things as you see them ? " " What can you do ? " the judge asked . " You can do this , Mr. Wis-. well : you can remind yourself that if the lady  --  and of course it is a lady  --  does n't see things as you see them , it 's because she does n't know the truth . Yet she 's obviously a true lady and a reasonable one . Otherwise she 'd never have written things that first made you smile as you did , even while she wrote words that later hurt you . " I could n't say a word . " And of course she loves you , " the judge went on , " because she'strying to help you . She 's careful to season advice with gentleness , and that 's not easily done . I suspect you 're fortunate in your choice . " " I 'm fortunate if I can hold her , " I said , " but how can I hold her when she 's forever hearing that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruelty and butchery ? My God , Judge , do men believewhatever lie they hear about an enemy ? " " Always , " the judge said . " Suppose , Mr. Wiswell , you read me part of your letter  --  I mean the part that hurt you . I know what it is to be separated from those held dear . It 's a sort of torture that 's always increased by doubts . " When I did as he suggested , Judge Hendon caressed one crippled hand with the other . " I thought it might be like that , Mr. Wiswell . Your lady has heard the old shibboleths of war  --  all the old accusationsthat were made , no doubt , by the Medes and the Persians against their enemies ; by the Phoenicians ; by the armies of Julius Caesar . She 's mistaken , Mr. Wiswell ; and all she needs , I think , is your personal assurance that your side of this struggle is supported by arguments that are far from weak ; that its motives and sentiments are far from base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who support it are not unheroic . " You 've been hurt by the lady 's suggestion that you turn to the rebel viewpoint ; but I think you can make her understand that a cause which is embraced and cherished by so vast a portion of American society , regardless of obloquy and disaster , can never be turned out of court summarily and contemptuously . " It 's clear from the lady 's letter that the rebels are branding us to the whole world as execrable , and insisting that there is neither patriotism nor decency outside the rebel ranks . " Well , Mr. Wiswell , you ca n't very well extol your own decency and patriotism ; but if your lady can hear the truth from your own lips , she 'll recognize it ; for every true lady is by nature a Loyalist . We are the people who have land , belongings , position , and we 're standing by our guns in opposition to the people who have nothing . We 're the conservative people ; and what has been true of conservativepeople in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We dissent from extreme and injudicious measures , from violence , from oppression , from revolution , from reckless statements and misrepresentation . We ca n't stomach liars , bullies or demagogues , or leaders without experience , ability or sound judgment ; and in the end the lady you love will never love you less for holding to such beliefs . " There 's no denying that within our ranks are a fair portion  --  and in this statement I 'm again conservative  --  of the cultivation , of the moral thoughtfulness , of the personal purity and honor that exist inp259the American colonies . I 've seen a list , Mr. Wiswell , of those in your native Massachusetts who will probably be proscribed and forever banished for no reason except that they have been conservativemen . There are hundreds of them , and not one a tyrant ; not one a profligate ; not one a man of small consequence . Their names are those of the oldest and noblest families whose diligence and abilities founded and built up New England . They are the most substantial and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their attitude is inspired by conscientious conviction ; persisted in despite all the outrages that have been done against them , and despite all the outrages that they still must suffer . " Conservatives are n't braggarts as a rule , Mr. Wiswell ; but you can safely tell your lady or anyone else in the world that the side you have chosen has so much solid fact and valid reasoning behind it that any intelligent and noble-minded American can with reason take that side , and stick to it , and go into battle for it , and if necessary ( lie for it : even imperil all the interests of his life in defense of it without having either his reason or his integrity impeached . You never need fear that your lady will ever believe otherwise , once she hears your case from your own lips . " The words of the old judge gave me new courage . In spite of the tumultuous croaking of the frogs , the shrill whining of the mosquitoes , the dank moisture of this miserable swamp , and the hard bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and freer from distractingdreams than it had been for many a long and weary night.  |p260WHEN  , two weeks later , I sailed back to Staten Island with Buell and Captain James to deliver my report , the broad sweep of bay between Long Island and Staten Island held what I was sure was the greatest fleet ever assembled ; and James was jubilant . " The best army on earth could n't stand against the force already piled into this harbor , " James said , " and there 's more coming ! All of Sir Henry Clinton 's men sailed in here on thirty-five transports just a few days ago , after catching hell at Fort Moultrie ; and there has n't been a day since then that ships have n't come in from Jamaica , Florida and the Mediterranean . " He wagged his head . " Those British must have a warship in every port that holds more'n fifty gallons of water ! When all of ' em get here , there ought to be enough to take all of New York without firing a shot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There ca n't be more than six other ships left in the whole world , I 'd think . " James looked pained . " The admiral ai n't here yet , even , " he said . " He 's the general 's brother . You ought to know as well as I do that an admiral wo n't go to sea in any warship smaller than Fraunce 's Tavern , or make a move without having a hundred other ships go along . When the admiral gets here , the ships 'll be packed into this bay like plover in a barrel . Then we 'll chase those damned rebels back where they belong  --  back to making shoes and spreading fer-tilizer . " " Why is n't the general 's brother here ? " I asked . " When 's he ex-pected ? " " God only knows , " James said . " He and his fleet left Englandp261thirteen weeks ago ; but where he 's been all that time , and what he 's been doing , there 's no way of finding out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Buell said thoughtfully . " If he takes more'n three months to sail across the Atlantic Ocean , I do n't know as I 'd like to be depending on him to get me out of a Hempstead swamp . " We felt more cheerful when James put us ashore on Staten Island , for though there had been tent towns upon it when we had left it in July , there had also been broad meadows of tall grass between the encampments : meadows starred with buttercups and daisies . Now there seemed to be only endless row upon row of tents ; and among them and around them moved soldiers in scarlet and white , as innumerable as the leaves that whirl down from maples in an October gale . The Rose and Crown farmhouse had stood in an open field when we last saw General Howe ; but today marquees and tents were ringed close about it , as the houses of Boston encircle Faneuil Hall . To get inside that farmhouse was even more difficult than penetrating to the heart of Hempstead swamp ; for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarlet , white and gold stood in the yard , on the doorsteps and in the entryway within , all of them irritable and smelling of sweat and smoke , and almost all of them contemptuous of mere civilians like Buell and me . Sentries and officers alike looked amused when I asked that my name be taken to General Howe . He was , they said indifferently , at a council of war , and there was no knowing when the council would be over . " You 'd better go see Loring , " Buell told me . " If we do n't get in to see the general for a week or two , Judge Hendon and those friends of his might all be killed . If Howe wants to wreck the British Empire by sitting here and doing nothing , I suppose that 's his lookout ; but I kind of took a fancy to that old judge , and feel as if he was our lookout . You get Loring , Oliver ! I 'll stay here and keep an eye on what happens . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour later with Loring , Buell was the center of a knot of British officers , to whom he was holding forth on the peculiarities of rebel currency . " These forty-dollar notes , " he said , " ai n't worth forty dollars as money , of course ; but to collectors I should n't wonder if they 'd be worth a lot more than forty dollars some day . No matter how you look at ' em , they ai n't a bad investment  --  if you buy ' em right , the way you can from me . If you gentlemen beat the rebels when you cross over to wherever you 're crossing to , there wo n't be any more of this rebel money issued . It 'll be rare , and therefore valuable . If the general decides he ai n't going to cross over and do any fighting , the rebel government will be as good as any government , and its money just like regular money everywhere . That means it 'll be worth forty dollars . " " How much did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " an officer asked . " Ten shillings hard money , " Buell said . " I 'll give you five . " Buell looked shocked . " Oh my ! I could n't do that ! Oh my , no ! I worked too hard for this money to throw it away ! I do n't believe you gentlemen understand what I 'm offering you ! Of course it do n't make any difference to me if you do n't know enough to buy ' em , because I can use ' em for money when I go back to Long Island . The only reason I 'm letting you have any of ' em is that I 'm grateful to you gentlemen for coming over here to help us . I want to do you a favor ; that 's all . " The officer handed him ten shillings , and I saw others of those about Buell absent-mindedly feeling in their pockets , as men do when contemplating a purchase . I went on into headquarters with Loring ; but not even Loring 's influence was sufficient to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the following noon , after long hours of waiting , were Buell and I admitted for an interview that I considered far too brief . " Go back at once , " Howe interrupted , as soon as I 'd handed him my written report and told him the merest fraction of our experiences , " go back to Long Island at once ! " Take word to those men in the swamps not to lose heart . Tell ' em that when I reach Long Island , I 'll put all of ' em in Provincial corps , officered by Provincials . They 'll be provided with clothes , equipment , food , pay . Spare no efforts to arouse their enthusiasm , Mr. Wiswell ! We can use those men ; and besides , I want to get ' em under military control before they try to revenge themselves on the rebels . So go back at once , Mr. Wiswell . At once ! Rejoin me as soon as the army lands on Long Island , and report to Mr. Loring. "  | " Can you give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I asked . " Do n't worry your head about that , Mr. Wiswell , " Howe said . " It 's enough for you to know that I 'll be there eventually . " " No , it ai n't , General , " Buell said promptly . " It 's hot as hell in those swamps , and the men 's breeches have rotted away . If they got to stay there till frost , they 'll freeze . If you ai n't coming over for a few months yet , I 'd like to take ' em some knives so they can cut a few rebel throats and get themselves whole breeches and warm blankets as a Christmas present . You ought to give ' em just a hint , General , so they wo n't  --  " The general stopped him with an upraised fat hand . " You can tell ' em I 'll be there before Christmas , " he said , and no doubt he thought he was being facetious . To me his words lacked humor , and carried a threat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his cause , which unhappily was also ours . James took us back to Jamaica Bay ; and as we lay on the deck of the little sloop in the hot August sunshine , Buell discoursed profoundly concerning commanders in chief . " The general of an army , " he said , " is an army 's soul , and an army without one is like a wife without a husband . That 's why a commander in chief always sends others to do dangerous things for him , and takes all the credit if they 're successful . " He 's the only man in an army that can have any ideas , so it would n't be military for him to consult any other person 's convenience , or to take anybody else 's opinion about anything if the opinion ai n't the same as his own . A general has to be awful secret  --  bout his plans ; and he has to be silent and sulky , or else people might et to think he was n't being secret . If he ai n't got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sulky and silent , too , so folks 'll think he knows everymgthere is to know . " Generals most generally do n't often get their distinguished rank ecause they 're the best fighters , but because of being left-handed lations of a king or friends of a left-handed politician . Naturally cy ai n't smart enough to promote smart soldiers just because ey 're smart , and that 's why you never find smart officers around commander in chief . " One of the few things a commander in chief knows is that soft ing makes soft soldiers . That 's why he gives his men bad food d not enough clothes  --  so they wo n't get soft and refuse to fight.  | He figures desperate men are careless about their lives , so he figures his army 'll fight best if all the men in it wish they were dead to beginwith . " A commander in chief has to be mighty careful , too , not to be too hasty and win battles too quickly , because if he does , the war might be over before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He philosophized similarly throughout the voyage , and relapsed not into silence until we were once more ashore and on our way to Demott 's to carry Howe 's message to Judge Hendon , Mr. Lane and their Loyalist friends . From Demott 's we bore off to the eastward through the great brush plains to Massapequa , where other hundreds of Loyalists were congregated in the tortuous waterways that empty into Massapequa Creek ; and from Massapequa we continued on to Islip , where more Loyalists had built themselves a maze in the brush and lived at the heart of it . So skillfully was the maze constructed that rebel mobs and regiments dared not even try to penetrate to its center for fear of being ambushed . Then we turned north and back toward the western tip of the island , stopping to give Howe 's message to our hunted fellow countrymenliving in the Sunken Meadows and among the circle of hills south of Huntington  --  one of them a veritable mountain over four hundred feet high , on the top of which a guard of Loyalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We told the Loyalists south of Oyster Bay , and in the winding sedge swamps near Great Neck and Flushing ; then , traveling only by night , we set our course for the shores of lower New York Bay , where we could lie on the slopes south of Brooklyn and look across to Howe 's camp on Staten Island . When we first came to Long Island in July , the little towns had seemed peaceful , even though they were n't ; farmers had been busy in their fields ; the roads were tranquil enough . But now all that was changed . Along every highway traveled companiesof rebel militiamen , constantly looking apprehensively over their shoulders at the ships that thronged the Narrows between Long Island and Staten Island . The militiamen had reason to look apprehensive ; for in a few days ' time those ships had multiplied until their very numbers were menacing and eye-arresting , as is a black cloud athwart the heavens.  |p265Before  every farmhouse , all day long , stood men and women and children , gathered in knots to stare at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever before seen , or ever would see again . Far in the distance , as we lay concealed in the brush on the hillslopes , we saw scouting parties of rebels moving down to the shore from the Heights of Brooklyn behind us , settling themselves in vantagepoints which they thought would be useful for the repulse of landing parties ; then , as if aware of their own insignificance in that vast panorama , rising , mere midges on an ocean 's rim , and raggedly moving on to fresh positions . Water , earth and air seemed to quiver with impending battle . To our ears came slow irregular pulsations of distant guns , now from the Jersey shore , blue in the heat haze to the westward ; now from New York itself , which was screened from our sight by the rising land of Brooklyn in our rear . From the swarm of vessels between us and Staten Island rose an unending buzzing such as sounds within a nest of angry hornets  --  a buzzing made up of the rolling of innumerable drums , the piping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , the creaking of myriads of blocks and tackles , all blended by distance into an ominous humming . At night , when we ventured from our hiding places to visit farmhousesfor food , the campfires and the lighted tents on Staten Island Were like a low-lying , rosy cloud hovering above the galaxy of stars that were the masthead lights , riding lights and binnacle lights of that tremendous fleet . The farmers upon whose doors we furtively tapped were Loyalists at heart , every last one of them . They were white-faced with fury at the outrages perpetrated upon them by the rebel militia , dubbingcm " thieves " , " harpies " , " brigands " , " footpads " ; and their craving or relief racked them physically , as thirst racks a wanderer in the desert . " When 's Howe coming ? " they whispered to us as they gave us ickens and bread . " What 's he waiting for ? We heard he was cornyesterday ! When 's he coming ? " Knowing us to be Loyalists , they waved aside our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he called it , in the form of Conentalnotes . A chicken , he insisted , was worth at least one thounddollars in Continental money , and a loaf of bread one hundred dollars . An egg , in his opinion , had a value of forty dollars ; and he said a cow ought to bring at least twenty thousand . On the morning of August twenty-second our long waiting ended . We wakened , in our brush shelter , to a hot , cloudless , brilliant morning and to a distant rumbling that made me think for a moment I was back in the swamp at Hempstead , listening to the dull booming of the frogs . But it was cannon fire , not frogs ; and when we peered from our hiding place , we saw that all the hundreds and hundreds of warcraftthat dotted the water between us and Staten Island were hoistingtheir sails and moving like bits of shining white glass in a kaleidoscope . All around them rowed innumerable flatboats , so that there was restless movement everywhere  --  even upon the Staten Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to slip about and quiver . Whole acres of them wavered and flattened , as though pressed down by an invisible hand ; then the little squares of canvas seemed to shrink ; and where the tents had stood , appeared splotches of green which flowed together and became open fields . Below us , on the Long Island shore , straggling columns of rebel militia , drab through a faint fog of dust , moved slowly between fires that kept pace with them , erupting plumes of dark gray smoke . " Damned rebel horse thieves ! " Buell said . " They 're burning all the hay and fodder ! Well , brothers , enjoy yourselves while you can , because the next thing that gets burned will be your own backsides ! " He made his usual morning toilet , picking straws from his stockings , tightening the kneebands of his breeches , rubbing his eyes with his knuckles , thrusting his fingers through his unruly hair , and scrubbing his teeth with the frayed end of a twig dipped in salt . I agreed with Buell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortifications that they could erect , could stop for a moment the tremendous fleet of warcraft maneuvering in the Narrows , or the great army of scarlet-coated soldiers that we could see flowing like distant blood-red ribbons down across the meadows of Staten Island toward the shore . Along that shore , like a black fringe , were flatboats , score upon score of them ; and the scarlet ribbons , as we watched , flowed smoothly down and filled them . " Yes , sir , " Buell went on , " this time Howe 's got ' em where he wants ' em ! The fleet 'll get between New York and Brooklyn , andP267the army 'll get behind Brooklyn . The rebels 'll he pinched between ' em , and this time there wo n't be any place for ' em to go ! Come on , Oliver ! We 've waited a long time for this , so let 's go down and watch it happen . " As we cautiously made our way closer and closer to the lower bay , taking advantage of every hedge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a signal gun pressed our eardrums ; and those narrow waters , alive as they had been up to now , awoke to an even more tumultuous activity . We saw bateaux and row-galleys move out from the Staten Island shore , oars all aglitter in the brightness of the morning ; and behind them , like a gigantic flag striped blue and white , close ranks of white boats moved over the blue water . From the bows of the bateaux and row-galleys jetted puffs of white smoke that swirled back upon the boats as rain clouds swirl about a mountain , and from those clouds came the thunder of great guns . The striped flag of boats , driven by oars that flickered through the smoke , moved toward us like a miniature thunderstorm . On the Staten Island shore , scarlet-coated soldiers still poured into flatboats ; and through the alternately thinning and thickening smoke above the approaching flotilla , we could see the flatboats moving with the regularity of machines to the sides of transports ; see thin scarlet streams ascending from the boats into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flowerpot ; see the sails of the transports rising . While we still hurried toward the road , the transportsmoved out from the Staten Island shore to follow the flotilla Mf boats . There were so many of them that the whole horizon seemedcked with their white sails . We knew , long before we came to it , that we were near the main pad along the bay ; for from it rose the gabbling of innumerable ees . They were those of the men in the militia regiments we had recently seen from higher up on the slope ; but now those men ere hurrying pell-mell back toward Brooklyn , a disorderly rabble . They were in a panic , throwing away their packs , pushing their muskets behind fences , ridding themselves of cartridge boxes and the little things that seem , to panic-stricken men , to impede them1 their flight . Their eyes were staring ; their faces white and sweaty ; it mouths agape , as though they lacked the strength to close . Where their officers were , God only knew . P268When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buell and I came out into the road . Ahead of us , as far as we could see , hayricks , corn shocks , wheat stacks and piled fodder smoldered and blazed . We saw men run into the road , stare momentarily in our direction , then fall to work upon the blazing piles with flails , pitchforks , buckets of water . Whole families stood huddled in farmyards , watching us as we drew near  --  fearful , of course , that we might be rebels ; unwilling to make open display of their sympathies before men who might drive them from their homes . When Buell waved his hat at them and bawled " Howe 's coming ! " , all those doubtful people magically changed . They raced , shouting , to their homes ; scurried out again , their eyes all shining ; signaled to unseen neighbors ; poured out into the road behind us to hasten toward the ever-louder cannonading . When at last we turned the point that had shielded Gravesend Bay from us , we came upon a spectacle that still in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of boats , filled with soldiers in blue coats and in red coats , moved across that shallow sheet of water . Behind them , from an endless double row of transports , scarlet-coated men flowed down into waiting bateaux . Beyond those lines of transports were other vessels under full sail , their bulwarks and ratlins studded thick with soldiers . Wherever we looked there were boats , men , ships ; ships , men , boats ; longboats packed with soldiers ; flatboats laden with horses ; sedge boats and bateaux carrying cannon ; gundelows , schooners , brigs , . barks , ships , every last one acrawl with men . We hurried around the curving shore of the bay to the long white beach where this enormous force had already begun to land . The soldiers in blue who had filled all those first boats , I then saw , were the Hessians of whom everyone in America had heard so many conflictingstories , most of them unpleasant . I expected them to be fierce , hard-faced , brutal men . Instead of that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heavy that rivulets of perspiration ran down their flushed cheeks . They were working like farm hands , carrying knapsacks , powder barrels , rolled tents and stores of every description to high ground ; and as we hastened past them , looking for the presiding genius of this vast movement of troops , they stared white-eyed at us , as a skittish colt might eye a bear cub . It dawned upon me that they mustP269have heard even more terrifying stories about us than we had heard of them . " Oliver , " Buell said , " those Hessians do n't look extra bright to me . I got a notion I could do real well for us if I stayed around ' em a few days . " He went to one of them , drew a forty-dollar note from his pocket , held it before the Hessian 's startled eyes and raised four fingers . " Four shillings , " he said with exaggerated distinctness . " Forty dollars , four shillings . " The Hessian just stared at him ; and others of his comrades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer appeared from nowhere to strike the soldier sharply across the back with a cane , and shout gutturally . When the boy shied away , Buell caught him by the wrist and put the forty-dollar note in his hand . When we went on , all the Hessians , officer and men alike , looked over their shoulders at us as at somethingdangerous . " By God , Oliver , " Buell whispered , " did you see that boy 's face when the officer hit him ? Why , he did n't mind being hit ! He was just a little ashamed of being caught talking to us ! " The beach and the grassy meadows at the end of the bay were a turmoil of British light infantrymen and troops of cavalry . Cavalryenpushed and hauled their horses off the flatboats that had brought hem ashore . Horses squealed with terror ; plunged off the boats in showers of spray ; swam to shore with laid-back ears and staring yes ; shook themselves on the beach ; rolled on the grass ; while sweating light infantrymen scuttled cursing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hessians and the light infantrymen , on rising ground , as a platform built of planks laid upon a score of beer kegs . On the latform stood a sort of desk , also made of planks on beer kegs ; and t the desk , watching the troops that poured unendingly ashore , was handsome young Lord Percy . Close to him , on the platform and all pound it , were aides with maps , uniformed clerks with open notemksand eager officers all smiles and good nature , as men are whenharking on an adventure that offers them certain success and ssible fame . Among the throng was Captain Cunningham , his red face bent cr a map ; and when I pushed through the crowd and reported myself , as Howe had told me to do , he was amiably casual . " WisII , eh ? Well , well ! Yes , yes ! I 've been expecting you ! Now see here , Wiswell , what 's the name of that place where all those fellows live in a swamp ? " " Hempstead ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cunningham said . " Never heard such names as they have in this damned country ! How do you ever remember them ? We 've got to go there , Wiswell . " " To Hempstead ? To Massapequa ? " " With a troop of dragoons , " Cunningham said . " I 'll see to your mount . " Buell made sounds of protest . " I ai n't used to horses , Oliver , " he said . " You go , and let me stay here and see what happens . Maybe I can have a few business dealings with those Hessian officers . " Cunningham looked incredulous . " Not used to horses ? Thought everybody was used to horses ! " He turned contemptuously from him . " Now then , Wiswell , " he said , " the general 's orders are to let all those swamp fellows see what we look like . Put heart in ' em if they need it , eh ? Show those damnable rebels they 'd best have a care , what ? We 'll start at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens . " No Roman emperor , returning victorious from his conquests , ever received a more wholehearted welcome than did our little troop of cavalry in that ride to the eastward , away from the satiny blue of Gravesend Bay and all those hundreds of ships and flatboats . From every farmhouse we passed , from every little village and crossroads settlement , rejoicing Long Islanders poured out to see us go by , and their welcome was as sincere as it was tumultuous . Girls pelted us with flowers ; small boys ran leaping and shouting beside our stirrups ; young men and old men too kept pace with us to ask how many had come ashore with Howe ; to tell us that Heard 's regiment of rebel militia had hurried away to the northward earlier in the day ; that Birdsall 's militia had disbanded only that morning ; that Duyckinck 's New York mob had stolen boats and embarked for safety on Great South Bay . Whenever the troops stopped to rest and to water their horses , farmers hurried to us with offers of forage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , barrels of cider , crates of chickens , firkins of butter . They slapped our horses ' flanks , rubbed their sweaty shoulderswith handfuls of grass , readjusted our stirrup leathers , made little fondling gestures.  |p271But  their welcome was pale indeed by comparison with that which awaited us at the swamps . We reached Demott 's mill late in the afternoon , to find Demott and his family clustered at the gate around a barrel of beer on a sawhorse , and Demott himself almost inarticulate with excitement . " Oh , by God , Mr. Wiswell , " he shouted , " tell ' em to get off and take any damned thing ! Anything we got ! Have some pie ! Have some corn , oats , beer , cheese ? How about a sheep ? Birdsall 's gone , God damn him ! He and his men went through here an hour ago  --  took my last two horses and set fire to my barn ! " " We want word sent to Judge Hendon , " I said . " Captain Cunninghamwants to talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's sent already ! We knew what had happened when Birdsall 's men came through , and I sent word as soon as they 'd left ! You do n't think I 'd leave ' em rotting  --  " He broke off ; turned his head from us ; then ran to the rear of the mill to stand listening . The frogs were croaking again , and the resonant chorus of those grumbling millions seemed to fill the air about us to the exclusion of all other sounds . Demott looked around meaningly , his fat face split by a grin . Above the rumbling of the frogs we heard a distant splashing ; the harp rap of wood against hollow wood ; a far , far , faint shout . Out from the brush beyond Demott came a man who might have cen a familiar spirit of marshy obscurity and damp . He was thin , rk , twisted , like the root of a swamp tree . His hair had the lankssof wet weed ; his face was drawn , swarthy , unshaven ; his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and peered at us . Then he spun about and ran back into the brush , shouting , " They 're here ! They 're right here now ! They 're here ! They 're here ! " The brush waved and swirled , as if a storm whipped it , and the en from the swamp burst from it , hollow-eyed , haggard , clothed rags or in garments that hung upon them like those of scarewsin a tempest . They ran toward us , shouting hoarsely and exultantly , and Demott was engulfed by them as by a flood. 3 saw Judge Hendon , supported by young Barbarie and Stephen Lancey , emerge from the wall of undergrowth , and the Reverend . Lane  --  good Doctor Rounds , too , and all the kind gentlemen o had shared their food and shelters with me for so many days. y came out and came out ; poured through the mill yard and into the road ; dodged between our horses , and under them . They pressed close to us on every side , waving limp hats and laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , their hands reached out to hold our bridles . The faces of those near us were contorted , as if by pain or violent exertion ; but from the smarting in my own eyes , I knew their grimaces were joyful .   CUNNINGHAM seemed genuinely moved at the happiness of all these persecuted men , and when he spoke to them , he was almost inarticulate . " The general sent a message , " he said . " Heard all about your misfortunesin this swamp  --  dreadful place ! Worse than we 'd imagined . Afraid some of us thought Mr. Wiswell 's report somewhat exaggerated , but not at all ! No , no ! Far from it , far from it ! " He cleared his throat , seemed to rack his brain for further thoughts , and went on fumblingly : " The general presents his compliments  --  veryappreciative of your loyalty  --  wants your assistance  --  if you 're willing to give it , I mean to say . " A drawling voice spoke from the back of the throng . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pound of powder . " The men around us shuffled their feet in the dusty road and stared soberly at Cunningham . " Oh dear me , yes , " Cunningham said quickly . " You 'll have whatever you need . " " That 's a pretty big order , " another voice said . " Maybe you ai n't noticed how much we ai n't got . " Cunningham spoke heartily . " I have indeed ! We 'll supply all deficiencies  --  all ! Powder , muskets , uniforms , boots  --  " An awed voice echoed the words . " Boots ! " " Foots , " Cunningham said firmly . " Any rum ? " a new voice inquired . Cunningham looked contemptuous . " Rum ! You 'll have lashings for it ! What else do you need ? " " Nothing but a good general , " a man drawled.  | The ragged , haggard company , hitherto sober and silent , laughed dryly . Captain Cunningham smiled too , but somewhat sourly , I thought . There was a movement among Cunningham 's audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barbaric brought Judge Hendon forward in his chair . The old judge raised a twisted hand in a queer half-salute . " You wo n't misunderstand these pleasantries , I hope , " he said to Cunningham . " Men say unexpected things , I fear , when they 've had to hide in swamps for months . " Cunningham stared down at the old man and grinned lopsidedly . " So they kept you in this swamp for months , did they ? Well , they 'll be paid back , never fear ! " His voice was almost kindly as he added , " There must be something about the air of this damned country that makes Americans behave like wolves . " The judge eyed him thoughtfully . " We 're Americans , Captain , just as the Huguenots were Frenchmen ; just as the Cavaliers , in England , were Englishmen . " Cunningham smiled vaguely . " No doubt , " he said . " No doubt . But that was long ago , and this is now . " " Civil war 's civil war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been and always will be . Intolerance brings it on , and intolerance is the greatest curse of every land , though every man likes to think his own land is free of it . " With a helpless movement of his twisted hands the judge seemed to change the subject . " You say General Howe wants these men 's assistance , Captain . Well , I can speak for them . They 'll fight the rebels , and they 'll fight as well as any troops ever fought . But there 's one thing on which they insist , and we may as well have it understood now . All these men are refugees from American rebels , but they 're Americans too , and they do n't want anyone to forget it , ever . It 's their wish and determination , Captain , to fight only as Americans , and only under American officers . " Before we rode on to Massapequa , Cunningham had agreed to all Judge Hendon 's suggestions for the welfare of his men , and the men themselves had marched off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , for the first time in months , and every last one of them eager to repay with interest a few of the things that had been done to them . The way they repaid it , after they had been incorporated in DeLancey 's Loyalist Battalions and the New Jerseyp275Volunteers , is as shining an example of fortitude as any nation 's history can show . On the twenty-fourth of August we came back again to the westernend of Long Island , and we rode at a canter ; for ahead of us , to draw us onward , was an unending slow hammering of heavy guns . " Ca n't be a battle , " Cunningham said repeatedly , as if to reassure himself . Then he would rake his horse with his spurs and bark sharply at his troop , urging them to make better time  --  though no troopers could have made better . I never saw a man as fearful of missing anything as Cunningham was of missing the battle that would destroy the rebels and end the war . " Those bloody damned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , over and over . He constantly licked his lips as a man does when he anticipates a sensuous pleasure . A range of forested hills cross the western end of Long Island , sheltering its tip and the Heights of Brooklyn from the monotony of the brush plains to the eastward ; and the cannonading , we found , was coming from those timbered heights . From afar , as we rode , we saw a smoke haze above the level countrybetween us and those hills . It was the smoke from Howe 's main camp  --  a camp which , when we reached it , seemed to stretch almost all the way across Long Island . Cunningham made choked sounds of relief when we caught our first glimpse of that enormous camp . " Upon my word , Wiswell , " he said , " I was startled when first I heard those guns ! ' Cunningham , ' I said to myself , ' your luck 's run out ! You 've waited months to pay those rebels back for what they did to you in Philadelphia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had to do a good turn for a few bloody ragamuffins in a swamp . ' That 's what I said , Wiswell ; but by God I believe I was wrong ! I believe I 'll be in at the death after all ! " Everybody in that enormous camp shared Cunningham 's confidence ; and even Buell , when I found him near Joshua Loring 's headquarters , was so much a picture of assurance that his greeting to me struck me as almost patronizing . " Welcome back , my boy , " he said . " Have a nice little trip ? " He flicked ash from a cigar and examined the tip with the eye of a connoisseur .   " What 's happened to you ? " I asked . " You must have found food that agrees with you . " " I have , Oliver , but not enough to live on . I had just the merest taste of it when I had dinner with General Howe , and I  --  " " Dinner ! You had dinner with General Howe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is one of the general 's , and there 's more of ' em in the tent . Let me tell you about that food I had at the general 's . Patty de foy graw , they call it . Made out of German geese 's lights or livers , but tasty . I 've been thinking I might settle on Long Island when the war 's over , Oliver , and raise geese . It 's as nice a place for geese as there is , and there ai n't any bird as entertaining as a goose . I got it all planned out : I 'd encourage my geese to eat too much , so they 'd have big lights and livers to make patty de foy graw out of . They 'd be bad-tempered , of course , with their livers all swelled up ; but I 'd have a few for pleasure and company , and would n't let ' em eat so much . I 've been studying geese , Oliver , and  --  " " Just a moment , " I interrupted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general ? " Buell gazed dreamily into space . " They lay their eggs in an open field , Oliver , and build little fences of paper around ' em . And you 'd never dream how they do their mating . Unless they have a puddle of water they " I shook him from his dreams of geese . " What about the general ? What about that battle ? " Buell passed his hand across his brow . " That 's right . You have n't been around here for a couple of days , have you ? Let 's see , did I tell you about getting rid of all my forty-dollar notes ? " " You 've told me nothing , " I said ; " nothing but some nonsense about geese and a lie about dining with the general . " Buell seemed puzzled . " Did n't I tell you about going inside the rebel lines ? Did n't I tell you about the third road through the hills ? " He caught himself , placed a finger warningly upon his lips , and glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Look here , " I said , " I want to know what Howe 's doing to put an end to this rebellion ! Tell me what you know  --  if you know anything . " " Well , " Buell said , " get rid of your horse and come over to the tent . It 's the one right behind Commissary Loring 's . There 's four geese tied to its tent pegs  --  two on each side . I 'd like to get youP277more interested in geese . They 're mighty cute , Oliver , and they 're an awful lot like people , only not so harmful . " When I had turned my horse over to one of Loring 's servants , I pushed through throngs of soldiers and women camp followers , all of them gabbling and laughing like sight-seers on a picnic . Well to the rear of Loring 's marquee stood a tent outside which three fat geese , fastened to tent pegs , stared haughtily at the sky . In the tent opening stood Buell , beneath his arm a fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come right in , " Buell said , " and have a cigar . Stedman ai n't here , but we 'll have Old Put for company . " He offered me a cedar box the size of a field desk . When I stretched out my hand toward it , the goose hissed terrifyingly and struck a hammer blow at me . The three geese outside the tent honked brassily . Buell shook his goose and spoke sharply . " Stop it , Put ! This here 's Oliver . " To me he said , " Old Put 's my pet . He 's named for that rebel general Putnam . Looks just like the general , he does : grumbles like him , lisps like him , waddles like him , putters around like him , but knows more . Better educated ! I tell you , Oliver , you ought to make a study of geese . It 'll help you a lot when you write your history . They 're the most peaceable birds there are , and if any other bird starts a fight near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . At the same time , they do n't like strangers , and do n't want ' em around . One mean-feeling goose 'll tackle ten others , and he do n't draw the line at little birds , either . He 'll peck a lady duck or a baby duckling to pieces , and not feel any sorrier about it than a general would . They get attached to you if you take their fancy , and follow you around like a dog , hoping you 'll do something to laugh at in a fond way . Old Put knows you 're  --  friend of mine now , and you 'll find he 'll be real kind to you . Sit in our lap for hours , Old Put will  --  if you 'll let him . " " I wo n't let him , " I said . " How 'd you happen to have dinner with General Howe ? " " You 're totally wrong about geese , " Buell protested . " If it was n't r these geese , I do n't know as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road through the hills and all the rest of it , for ar somebody 'd overhear me . But with these friends all round me , there ca n't nobody come near this tent without being honked at . o , Oliver ; a friendly goose is more than comfortable ; he staves If danger . Look at Rome . One night , a couple of thousand years or so ago , when the enemy was sneaking up on Rome , with everybodyasleep except one true-hearted goose  --  " " Did General Howe let you in to wash the dishes ? " I interrupted . " Was that how you got these cigars ? " " Me ? Did you ever see me wash even my own dishes ? " Buell looked indignant ; then kissed the top of the goose 's head . " Sweet thing ! " he said . " No , Oliver , I had dinner with the general because of finding that third road through the hills , and I found the third road through the hills because I had to get rid of my forty-dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ' em at all . " He went to the tent opening and pointed to the range of wooded hills that lay to the westward of the camp . " See those hills , Oliver ? " I just looked at him . " Over behind those hills , " he said , " there 's a fine big valley , all meadowland and little groves of trees . It 's the western tip of Long Island , and at the very end of the valley there 's a point of high land  --  Brooklyn Heights  --  that looks across to New York . The rebels have built a fort on that piece of high land , and put ten thousand men in it , and all their best generals . " He looked apologetic . " Of course , the word best ' do n't mean much when applied to rebel generals . Ten of their best ones do n't know half as much as a colonel out of any other army . " " Have you seen the fort ? " I asked . Buell spoke patiently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't worth a damn . When Howe puts ships on one side of it and a few regimentsof regulars on the other , it wo n't be any more use than a toy fort made out of kindling wood . The ten thousand men inside it wo n't have any place to run to , so they 'll have to surrender , generalsand all . " He puffed contentedly at his cigar . " Nonsense ! " I said . " No rebel general would send an army over to this island and risk a battle in a place from which he could n't retreat if he needed to . Only a fool or a madman would do such a thing ! " " Well , " Buell said , " generals would n't be generals if they acted like ordinary human beings . Washington has sent an army over here , and he 's put General Putnam in command of it ; and Putnam 's going to have a battle on his hands , whether he wants it or not . That Putnam , he stutters and putters and talks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it by telling everybody how good he is ; and somehow or other , God knows how , he 's got everybody believing him . He even claims he won the battle of Bunker Hill , and they even believe that.  |p279The  truth is , Oliver , he 's never won a victory , and never even fought a battle , so Washington 's put him in command of all the rebel troops on Long Island . That gives you kind of an idea what we 'd have got from the rebels in the way of government if they 'd won this war . " " But if the fort 's defended by good soldiers , " I said , " the general does n't need to be a good one . Look at what happened at Bunker 1-fill ! " " This is different , " Buell said comfortably . " If they 're licked here , they 'll have to stay licked  --  and that 's what they 're going to be : licked ! " " It must be a trick , " I protested . " Probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army , so the other part can steal out of New York and get safely away . " Buell looked at me compassionately . " Oliver , you 're like a lot of people . You do n't know a damned thing about the rebel army ; yet you feel free to tell me all about it . I 'll thank you kindly not to tell me what the rebels intend to do , and why they 'll do it  --  not till you go to see ' em and find out for yourself , the way I did . No , Oliver : there 's an awful good reason why that fort full of rebels ai n't here as a feint . " " What is the reason , Tom ? " " Because there practically ai n't any rest of Washington 's army ! It 's all in that fort on the other side of those hills . " " Do you mean to tell me that if that fort should be captured , there would n't be any more rebel army ? " Buell was patient with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Oliver . Why , you 'd never believe the damned-fool things those rebels have done ! " " If they 've failed to provide a means of escape in case of defeat , " said , " no other mistake they could make would be worth noticing . " " You 're wrong , Oliver , " Buell said . " I kind of half wish you 'd gota coat of tar and feathers yourself , so you 'd understand what terrible Hers those rebels are ! Look , Oliver : they not only sent their whole my over here onto this island and cooped it up so it could n't get ay , but Old Put took his very best troops out of that fort and sentover onto these hills . " He held back the tent flap to let me see the wooded Heights hence came the intermittent booming of the big guns . " There 's o passes in those hills , Oliver , and the best rebel troops are guard-'cm , miles away from their fort , so to keep Howe from marching through the passes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How 's that for plumb damned idiocity or whatever you want to call it ? " " If they did that , " I said , " the passes are probably narrow and easy to defend . " Buell impaled the butt of his cigar on the point of his pocketknife , so to get the last available mouthful of smoke . " That 's right , Oliver . They are easy to defend . I wanted to get across those hills , but I would n't have gone through either of those two passes ! No , sir ! Not while Howe 's guns are firing cannon balls through ' em , the way they are now , just to keep the rebels diverted , and while the rebels are sitting up there behind those trees waiting for Howe 's men to show their heads . Oh my , no ! " What I wanted , Oliver , was a nice quiet road through those hills  --  a road that did n't have any rebels on it , or any cannon balls whizzing through it . What 's more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and extended index finger swung from left to right , tracing the serrated outline of the ridge to the point where it was dim in the August heat haze . " I went prowling along the foot of that range of hills Oliver , figuring on going all the way to Long Island Sound if I had to ; and away over yonder , halfway to the Sound , I found just what I was looking for  --  a nice , peaceful , quiet pass . I walked right through it with my scissors-grinder on my back , and came out in that big valley without anybody so much as saying Boo to me . Nobody stopped me when I crossed the valley , and I went right up to the fort and hammered on its front door with my bell ; and the rebels came out with knives and bayonets to sharpen . I worked till dark sharpening ' em and buying their loot. " 1 bought three paintings , two silver teapots , a horse and eightysevendollars in hard money , all for thirty-nine thousand dollars that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse , went back to my nice quiet pass , bought four geese with my last fifty notes and two hard dollars , and came through the hills again just as simple and easy as kiss your hand . " Reluctantly he removed the remnants of his cigar from the point of his knife . I could n't believe I 'd understood him correctly . " You found an unguardedroad that took you around behind those hills ? A road that let you get between two rebel forces ? " " That 's what I did , Oliver . And as I said before , the best of allp281the rebel regiments were up in those hills , watching the two main passes . I got in behind ' em . There was n't anybody in the fort but militia consisting of grandfathers and little boys that ai n't interested in much of anything but going home . " Buell 's astounding statement made my spine tingle . The unguardedpass he had discovered would permit an army to get in behind the pick of the rebel forces , cut them off from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's why you had dinner with Howe , " I said . " Did he believe you ? I can hardly believe you myself ! How can those rebels be such fools as to invite extinction ? " " They were fools at Bunker Hill , were n't they ? " Buell asked . " ' They got themselves into a corner there , if you remember . What they 've done here ai n't much different from what they did at Bunker 1 fill , except that at Bunker Hill they had a neck of land they could ' cape over . Here they ai n't even got a neck of land . If they wantget away they 'll have to swim . As for Howe , I do n't know whether e believed me or not . He did n't take me into his confidence . Inet , he did n't even thank me for telling him about that third road. hat 's how I happened to get this box of cigars . I figured I wastitled to something for bringing him all that information , so whenwent out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd toldhim  --  I picked up an extra box of cigars I was sure he did n't wantd went out myself . " We sat in that hot little tent , listening to the near-by muted gab-g of Buell 's geese ; to the slow thudding of the guns on theded slopes before us . There seemed to be nothing more to say . 11 Buell was right , and if Howe believed him , the rebel army was ( ) tiled . Thoughts and hopes raced through my brain , and they were all I Sally .   THE twenty-sixth and twenty-seventh of that August  --  the August of 1776  --  will never be forgotten by any man who took part in the events that , on those days , turned the western tip of Long Island into a country of nightmare  --  a land where gorgons and hydras and chimeras dire would have seemed commonplace . Again and again , during the dark early-morning hours of the twentysixth , Buell , Stedman and I were wakened in our hot little tent by the ripping rattle of far-off musketry fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about us , so that we were the center of a humming like that of a giant beehive ; and at sunrise , while we were making a meal on a dubious mixture of salt pork and dandelion greens concocted by Buell the night before as a sop to his delicate stomach , one of Joshua Loring 's servants scratched at our tent flap and demanded the immediatepresence of Mr. Stedman to act as interpreter for the commissaryof prisoners . Buell immediately carried his dish of pork and greens outside the tent and put it before Old Put , who made short work of it . " We 'll all go over , " Buell said . " Loring gets the best food there is , on account of his wife being so helpful and companionable with the general , and I 'd like to pick up a little of it . What 's more , Loringpicks up a good deal of information in one way and another , and the sooner we find out what this drumming 's about , the better . There 's something serious afoot to get Loring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loring 's marquee was crowded with aides and assistants , filling out requisitions , compiling long lists of foodstuffs and forage , and dispatching orders and letters . Loring himself , palep283and perspiring , was listening distractedly to the guttural protests of two Hessian officers . " Good God , " Loring cried at sight of us , " tell me what these men want ! Mr. Stedman , I beg of you , find out what 's the matter , and promise them anything to keep them quiet ! Anything ! Good God ! As if I did n't have enough to do with a battle in prospect  --  a battle , and the whole rebel army likely to be made prisoner . " The Hessians , Stedman quickly learned , were profoundly disturbedover the indecent and barbarous fighting hours of the rebels . They fought and , like snakes , crawled in ditches and behind bushes at hours when all decent soldiers should be in bed , and so had contrived to capture two Hessian outposts . The two Hessian officers wanted their outposts recaptured . Loring , as always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he told Stedman , " that there 'll be no more rebel army by tomorrow night . heir outposts will be recaptured . Everything shall be done as the ntlemen wish ! No more crawling in ditches and behind bushes ! y word for it ! Get rid of them , Mr. Stedman ! " When the Hessians at last were gone , Loring told us the news , Ind his pale , clamlike eyes glittered with excitement when he spoke f prisoners  --  and well they might , for a commissary of prisoners n become a Croesus if permitted to purchase supplies for a sufficientnumber . We attack tonight , " Loring said . " My orders are to send three n with the van , and the three are Mr. Wiswell , Mr. Stedman and Buell . You 'll be needed as soon as prisoners begin to be taken , d your duties will be to assist in collecting them from their caps , and conducting them into whatever enclosure the provost rshal , Captain Cunningham , prepares for them . You will question m to obtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field of battle , and see that this information reaches the proper officers the earliest possible moment . Later , of course , your duties will be to list the provost marshal in seeing they 're properly lodged and fed. cull move out with Sir Henry Clinton and the advanced guard , and I 'll march at nine o'clock tonight . He 'll be followed by Lord Percy the thirteen regiments and the artillery . Lord Cornwallis will lead reserves . General Howe will march with Lord Percy . " - " Arc we going by my road ? " Buell asked ) ring ignored him . " The route 's a secret , and so 's the whole ement . Say nothing to anybody during the day , and report to Sir Henry Clinton 's headquarters staff at dark tonight . Leave your tent standing . No tent in this camp is to be struck . If the rebels should find out what we 're doing , it might cost us dear . " When we left Loring 's tent , Buell was jubilant . " So we leave our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that means ? It means we 're going to use my road  --  that third road ! It means there 's no rebel troops anywhere near it . It means we 'll get in behind the regimentsOld Stuttering Put sent out on those hills . Yes , sir , that 's what it means ; and another thing it means is that we 'll capture their fort and their whole damned army ; and by tomorrow night that General Washington of theirs is going to be saying , This is what we get for tarring and feathering Tom Buell . ' " That night march of Howe 's ten thousand troops  --  light and heavy dragoons , light and heavy infantry , artillery , ammunition wagons , commissary wagons laden with food and even the greater part of the women who followed the fortunes of those ten thousand men  --  was as splendidly executed a piece of military maneuvering as any general could have planned or any army performed . Buell , as the day drew to a close , seemed more worried about his geese than about the battle into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but geese , " he told me , " I 'd kill ' em and we 'd take ' em with us and eat ' em ; but I just ai n't got the heart to kill a friendly goose . I 'd as soon think of killing a little white dog that depended on me . I hate to leave ' em here , too , because the camp followers of this army ai n't got any morals to speak of . They 'd steal anything if they got a chance  --  and a goose is awful tempting . If I lost Old Put , I 'd feel like I 'd lost an uncle . By rights ought n't I to take him with me when we march ? " " Take a goose into battle ? " I said . " Not if you 're going with me ! " 13uell wanted to argue the point . Nearly every British officer , he reminded me , had brought a dog to America and took him wherever he went . A large number of the soldiers had brought women with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a matter of course . Why , therefore , was n't it right for him to take Old Put ? " Public opinion , " I said . " Taking a dog anywhere with you 's all right , and even women look less out of place in a battle than geese would . But a goose just would n't be understood . You 'd be criticized . " " I 've been tarred and feathered , " Buell said . " What do I care for a little criticism ! " " Think of your descendants , " I told him . " What 'll they think , ap285hundred years from now , when they read in history books that you would n't fight for your principles unless you had a loving goose beside you ? " Buell snapped his fingers . " I do n't care that for my descendants ! What use are they to me ? I wo n't take Old Put , but do n't think you talked me out of it . I 'm leaving him here totally because somethingight occur that 'd later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a leg or something , he might feel that way , and I do n't want nything to interfere with this friendship . " While I shaved and washed my clothes , as everyone should before battle , Buell dug a pit for the geese in one corner of our tent . t the bottom of the pit he put his scissors-grinder , pushed the outgedand complaining geese between its legs , added two loaves of read and a bucket of water , and on top of the scissors-grinder ranged his pocket printing press and the few meager possessions c had accumulated in the roving life we 'd led since we left Milton . When , at dusk , we tied down our tent flap and went to get our rses , Buell was depressed . " War 's a terrible thing , Oliver , " he id , " because it makes everybody crazy and willing to do anything all . A general steals a country or a city , and a common soldier n't hesitate to steal anything he can get his fingers on . All the rebels steal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 al , but talk high and mighty while they 're doing it . I ai n't so sure , liver , but what the whole world 's sinful . Maybe everybody ought be destroyed , so Europe and America could begin over with just c animals for populations . " As we moved toward the flatlands to the east of the camp , wherehad been told the staffs of General Howe and General Clinton uld assemble , the road and the fields on either side crawled and gcd with men , horses , wagons ; with hurrying aides , slow-movingcrs , troops of dragoons , women camp followers. s we rode farther and farther to the eastward , we found regintsstanding beside the road in long , long , dim lines ; and against background of this darkling human hedge , aides trotted backrdand forward . Buell 's pessimism was profound . " I hope I never have to be in an my , " he said , " but if I do , I 'll be in the cavalry and nowhere else . do n't know where people get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when what they mostly do is stand around and wait , loaded like a jackass , while some damn fool of a general 's aide gallops up and down in front of ' em , covering ' em with mud and horse manure ! " If I 've got to spend half my life waiting for a general to make up his mind , the way soldiers do , I want to sit down to it ; and God knows there 's no place to sit down in an army except on a horse ! I hate horses ; but there 's some things I hate more , and one of ' em 's standing around and waiting for a general . " It seemed to me we rode past miles of waiting soldiers before we came to two hillocks on which shrouded lanterns were partly screened by shifting , hurrying figures . At the foot of the nearer knoll a sentry halted us . I gave him the countersign for the night , adding " From the commissary of prisoners , to march with General Clinton . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's over there . This here 's General Howe . " We dimly saw the two commanders working with clerks and aides and orderlies , with colonels and majors , commissaries and sergeant majors , guides and adjutants , to make sure all was ready . Around the hillocks were companies of light infantry in short jackets and tight leather hats . They carried short muskets , little longer than pistols , and their knapsacks were mere nothings by comparison with the dreadful packs we 'd seen them carrying at Bunker Hill . On Clinton 's knoll we found Cunningham waiting for us , and we sat with him , shivering in the night damp and listening to army aides reporting on the readiness of those long lines of men upon the road behind us . How those endless lines could be moved in the darkness without deafening uproar and hopeless confusion was beyond me ; for I was n't a soldier then . Even at a later day , when I was a soldier and had learned to look on night marches as one of life 's disagreeable but unavoidable necessities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clinton and Cornwallis , Percy and Howe , as one looks back at a great performance on the stage , or brings to mind one of those rare and perfect happenings that men count themselves fortunate to have seen . Clinton , stooping over a map , looked to me like a wealthy Bostonianstudying his investments . He was short , fat , big-nosed , and had a habit of pursing his lips as though in contemplation of a wallet too meagerly filled . I knew little about Clinton then , except that hep287had opposed the costly tactics of Gage and Howe at the battle of Bunker Hill ; and I had the unpleasant feeling , as I watched him receiving the reports of aides and stabbing a pencil at his diagram , that he might lead us into trouble before the night was over . Buell had the same feeling ; he grumbled beneath his breath as he watched Clinton . " If he 's going to take us through that pass of mine , " Buell said , " he better forget that pencil and start moving ! That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small horse . " He turned to Stedman . " How many 'll travel this road with us , do you think ? " " Not less than ten thousand , " Stedman told him . " Ten thousand , " Buell echoed . " Well , figure it out for yourself . If that pass of mine only lets ' em through one at a time , it ought to take about five seconds for one man to go past a given spot in it . That would mean twelve men a minute , or seven hundred and twenty men an hour . Ten thousand men would be fifteen hours getting through , and that fifteen hours do n't allow for cannon getting jammed in the middle of the pass , or generals stopping to drink a bottle of wine and have their boots polished so they 'll look good in the battle , Here it is pretty near nine o'clock , so it looks to me as if this army would n't get much of anywhere till day after tomorrow ! " I saw Clinton straighten up from his diagram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The whole knoll was suddenly in a tumult of movement ; mounted officers clattered off ; all about us were faint hallooings , as if partridge hunters in deep woods shouted with repressed voices to fellow hunters . The light infantrymen were on their feet , moving from between the knolls , and beyond them I heard the clattering of innumerable horses . No one , I suppose , can know what a night march is like unless he 's been in one himself . Exasperation constantly floods the breasts f those who take part in it  --  exasperation at the endlessness of the bight ; at the depressing pangs of hunger ; at the oft-repeated andcmingly useless halts ; at the impossibility of knowing what liesthe darkness just ahead and on each side ; at the fits of shivering that weaken knees and set teeth to chattering ; at the gallopings of aides to front and rear ; at the enigmatic whispered reports delivered by messengers from the head of the column ; at the stupidityf those behind , perpetually blundering into those ahead during halts ; at the unexplained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unavoidable tumult of the moving army that seemingly must bring down upon the helpless column the withering fire of enemy guns . At ten o'clock we were marching and halting and marching . At eleven o'clock we were halting and marching and halting . At midnightwe were doing the same thing . We passed dim farmhouses , their occupants herded together beside the road under the guard of light infantrymen . The night air grew colder and colder , as if our slow progress to the north were taking us from summer into autumn . " Yes , sir , " Buell said , " we 're heading for my pass  --  that third road ; but at the rate we 're going , they 'll hear about it in Boston before we reach Brooklyn ! " At two o'clock in the morning our forward movement seemed to stop for good . Buell impatiently heaved himself about in his saddle ; and I , too , was bitterly resentful at our failure to get forward and within reach of the rebels . We were beside a tavern . Around it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the light infantry and all the dragoons had gone on ahead . We could hear , within the tavern , voices raised in argument ; but over what , we could n't know . We may have waited an hour when we heard shouts and laughter far ahead . Out of the darkness came a squad of dragoons . " Only five horsemen stationed in the pass , " we heard them shout . " Capturedall five ! Not another damn soul anywhere around ! The whole pass is open ! " They clattered to the tavern to report to Clinton , while we waited and shivered . Dawn was close ; stars were faint in the dark sky . Before us we could feel the loom of black hills  --  the long and dangerous hills that barred us from the rebels . I wondered how a man could stand the delays and disappointments of a soldier 's life unless his brain was partly atrophied . When the true dawn came , we moved at last , on and up into those dark hills ; and looking back , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , stretched out upon the plain behind us , the whole extent of the army that Clinton and Howe were leading against the rebels . Infantry regiments , grenadiers , artillery , Hessians , baggage train , camp followers  --  they were strung out across the flat fields like a mile-long caterpillar . It seemed a ghost of an army , movingP289silently in a faint pall of dust ; and in the gray dawn light the canarycoloredwaistcoats , white breeches , black gaiters , scarlet jackets , blue jackets , green jackets , were all a toneless drab . When we entered the pass , I saw it had been widened to let us through ; on both sides were windrows of felled trees . " By God , Oliver , " Buell said , " look at those trees ! They were n't chopped down ; they were sawed down , so to make no noise ! I tell you this General Clinton knows a thing or two ! He 's " Heseemed to catch himself , and laughed scornfully . " Listen to me run on ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that 's all there is to it ! " The pass , topping the ridge , turned westward ; and we , wheeling to the left , began to descend the inner slope on a long downward slant . Two aides clattered past us . " The rebel army 's on this ridge , " they shouted . " Move fast ! Move fast ! We 've caught the whole rebel army on this ridge ! We 've got to get down behind ' em quick ! " This heavily wooded ridge , which we had just crossed by the neglected third road , was the main position of the rebel army . Our night march had taken us out beyond where they lay about the mouths of the other two passes , waiting to be attacked ; thus we had outflanked them , and were now heading downward into the plain behind them . Buell 's horse jostled mine , and I felt his elbow against my ribs . It ai n't true , is it , Oliver ? I never really believed it could be done ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miseries  --  tar and athers . . . broken printing presses . . . burned barns . . . driven ut of Boston . . . proscribed . . . chased into swamps . . . turned to counterfeiters . . . damned near destroyed . . . . Do you really ink our luck has turned ? Are we really going to pay ' em back day  --  right now  --  for all they did to us ? It 's a dream , is n't it , liver ? " " No , " I said , " it is n't ! " And it was n't .   THE rocky road , gullied by past rainstorms , slanted steeply down through the woods . We , marching to the westerly , descending into the plain , had to our left and above us the hill forests that held the principal fighting force of the rebels ; and lo ! two miles to our right , across the plain , we beheld the fort that was their base . Not only was the plain between their base and them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long Island was spread out like a giant triangularmap , its far edges outlined by the blue waters of New York Harbor . It was a rich and rolling triangle of scattered farms and maple groves . In the golden light of the newly risen sun , the barns , the trees , the hillocks cast long black shadows across fields of ripeningwheat . On all that expanse of plain no figure moved . The fort was silent . Men behave unexpectedly when going into battle  --  are concerned with small things ; laugh easily ; seem gifted with an acuteness that at other times they lack . When we started down that rocky path , all the scarlet-coated officers who rode before us might have been out for an early-morning canter in a park ; for they listened deferentiallyto their neighbors ; spoke with exaggerated politeness ; held their reins unnecessarily high , to guard their horses from slipping on loose stones ; affected a lack of interest in that silent fort in the haze to the right of us . I marveled that the others could be so calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buell should seem unmoved . Then he pushed his horse close to mine . " What do you do to keep from getting scared , Oliver ? " he asked . " I feel bad inside , like jelly . " I felt a great relief at his words , for I suddenly knew that all theP291carelessness and indifference of the generals and colonels and ' majors and aides in front of us was assumed  --  that they , like myself and Buell , were torn and racked within by the fever of war . That 's all war is  --  a consuming fever : a period of delirium and insanity , of misery , disappointment , discomfort , anxiety , despair , waste , weariness , boredom , brutality , death ; and yet to every man in every war there comes a day worth living for : a day when a lifetimeof excitement is packed into a few short hours . This , I think , was such a day . While we were still high on the slope , the guns came thundering down the road , forcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gun after gun , caisson after caisson , bounced and crashed past us ke a succession of thunderous cyclones . To the tune of this crashg , the officers around me fumbled in their saddlebags for food ; and while they ate , their eyes wandered , hunting and ceaselessly hunting for signs of the rebel forces we were stalking . Buell , gnawing a cold chicken that he had obtained in some mystcriousway , pointed with its carcass toward General Clinton andhis staff , hazily visible to us through the dust that hung in the wake the guns . " They do n't know where the rebels are , Oliver , " he said . Look at ' em look ! We know as much as they do ! Do you think cy 've got away , Oliver ? Look at that valley ! Not a sign of life in it ! ' II bet they got away ! " Two scarlet-coated officers turned contemptuous stares on Buell , ho looked apologetic . " I s'pose I ought to say we got the situation well in hand , the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I ai n't a general . If those rebels ai n't got away , where are they . Where were they , indeed ! That distant fort out of which ragged bels had poured only two days earlier , to let Buell sharpen their knives , seemed devoid of life as a church on a weekday morning . Below us , at the foot of the hill , dragoons  --  scarlet toy soldiers onget horses  --  rode from the cover of the trees into the open road , ost as though a child had fastened them to strings and was wing them forward . Alongside them moved light infantrymen . From where we were they seemed to move slowly , like a stream of od crawling sluggishly along the narrow channel through thegreen wheat . All the guns had gone by , and dust hung like a dry fog in their wake . The dust was heavy with the scent of the fire struck from the P292rock by their wheels . When we moved on into that dust , our horses slipped and stumbled on the rocky road . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jolted by the tumult of sound that still came back to us from the artillery wagons . Through the opening in the trees we saw two guns come out upon the plain , their horses elongated in a gallop , and move off the road into a field of wheat . A ball of white smoke burst from the muzzle of one , and the wheat before it flattened and fluttered . While I waited , mouth ajar , for the roar to reach me , the other gun jetted smoke ; and the double boom of the two discharges drove my ribs against . my heart . Buell 's voice was hoarse . " That 's the signal , Oliver ! I heard ' cm say so up ahead . That 's the signal ; we 're through the pass , so those outside the other passes can attack  --  if there 's any rebels here to be attacked . Damned if I do n't think they 've all run home ! " He was wrong . He had no more than spoken when , far along the ridge on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see no smoke , but there was something solid and tangible about those two patches of gunfire . They were like two mountainous islands of sound : two towering thunderous columns , shot through with the lesser sharp rattle of musketry . The dusty riders before me , suddenly , ceased to be dim and colorless , and were brilliant against a shining background of gold and green . We were no longer in the shadows of the forested pass , but out in the valley among the wheat . Dragoons , drawn up beside the road , were not the toy soldiers we had seen from higher up , but giants of men in the clear light of early morning.  --  The straight road before us slanted away from the hills through which we had just passed , as the gaff of a raised mainsail slants away from its supporting mast . It ran straight as a string through the rolling fields , on its left the darkly wooded hillslopes from which the two pillars of gunfire still rose undiminished . Far , far ahead , along that road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappearing over the crests of hummocks and flowing up again to rises beyond . Behind us , out of the forest , poured an unending stream of infantry regiments . Officers near us shouted and pointed . Ahead of us dragoons and light infantrymen had broken from the ranks and were moving swiftly through the wheat toward the dark hills on our left.  |p293Buell  stood in his stirrups . " There they are ! " he whispered . " Look at ' em ! This is the last battle they 'll ever fight ! " A long line of dark figures had come out of the woods , advanced a short distance into the wheatfield and halted , so that they had the appearance of far-off scarecrows . More dark figures trickled out to join them . They all moved indecisively , seeming to drift in the direction of the pass we had so recently left . From that pass the wagons of our baggage train were just emerging , along with a horde of figures that I knew to be women camp followers and the strange human derelicts that follow an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarecrows ceased drifting , broke apart , reformedinto other groups ; broke again and moved swiftly back into the forest . The squad of dragoons from our column had far outdistanced the light infantrymen . Their closely massed horses slid upward through the green wheat ; slipped smoothly and silently into the forest after the vanished scarecrows . Surprisingly , then , the small dark figures reappeared at the edge f the forest , scurrying into the open like frightened insects . From the advancing thin line of light infantrymen rose puffs of white smoke . The distant dark figures halted and wavered . Dragoons came out from the trees at a gallop , and the little dark ; ores resumed their scurrying . I could see the flashing of sabers as he dragoons chased them : see the small dark figures flow down the ill , as if to throw themselves among the light infantrymen . The puffs of smoke thickened . Miraculously the dark figures dwindled in number , dwindled and dwindled . Where there had been forty , there were twenty-five ; then fifteen ; a moment later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rode back into the forest . Buell was indignant . " Why , those rebels never even made a fight ! " cried . " They just let themselves be killed ! " " They 're not all dead , " I said . " Some may be , but the rest must be crawling through the wheat like wounded partridges . I 'm going to move ahead with the column . You go on out there and see that see prisoners are brought in safely . " Mc ? " Buell asked . " I want to see the rest of this battle . " " You 'll see enough battle before the day 's over , " I told him . " Do as they say , and talk to the prisoners while you 're bringing ' em in . Find out about ' em . " I gave his horse a cut across the rump ; and Buell , still tabling , cantered toward the slope where the light infantrymenP294moved uncertainly in the field in which the dark figures had vanished . Until some of those dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no way of knowing who they were  --  barring the fact that they were rebels  --  or what they had been doing so far away from the two tempests of gunfire that continued to boom and thunder on the ridge at our left . Cunningham , who was just ahead , looked round at me , his red face split by a grin ; and when he saw me riding alone , he reined in his horse and waited . " By gad , Wiswell , " he said , " the whole thing 's working like a chess problem . Upon my soul , I believe they 've done the exact things I 'd have wanted them to do if I 'd planned the battle for them myself . The general 's making for that little village ahead of us  --  Bedford . He 'll establish headquarters there , and you and I 'll continue on till we find the proper place for prisoners . We 'll have as many as we can handle before this day 's over ! " " Those men who came out of the woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they doing there ? " Cunningham spoke contemptuously . " Making fools of themselves , for one thing ! I suppose they think they 're the left wing of the rebel army  --  which has no business out on this ridge to begin with . They must be the left wing , because the center 's guarding the middle pass through these hills , where all that banging 's coming from , and the right must be guarding the pass at the end of the ridge , close to the harbor , where you hear the rest of the banging . Yes , Oliver , I really think those men we saw belong to the left wing ; and if so , the rebels ' left wing was in the air , where no wing should ever be . A wing ought to be anchored to something . In this particularcase , to be of any assistance at all , a left wing should have been anchored to the pass we came through , so to fight us off when we started to move in behind them . God knows who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ought to be court-martialed and shot . What 's more , the men themselves do n't deserve much mercy , because they let themselves be surprised . In an army , Mr. Wiswell , that 's a worse sin than murder . " " What makes you so sure this 'll work out prettily ? " I asked him . " Bunker Hill should have worked out prettily , but it did n't . " " That 's true , " he admitted , " but that was due to a piece of stupidity that could n't happen again . Here there 's no way for things to go wrong . The Hessians have attacked the middle pass on the otherP295side of the ridge ; General Grant 's attacked them at the far pass . When they learn we 're behind them , there 'll be nothing for ' em to do but run for their fort . When they do , they 'll run straight into our arms . We 'll have the whole of ' em in our hands by nightfall  --  all of ' em , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the rebellion . " On rising ground in the center of the rolling plain through which we rode was a group of small farms and outbuildings , clustered round a crossroads . When we reached this little settlement , it was swarm with dragoons and light infantry . They were around the ouses , in them , behind them : a tangle of shouting officers , worriedokingmen , restive horses . A sentry motioned us into a farmyard . The tumult was deafening . battery of four guns stood at the rear of the yard , pointing toward c dark hillslopes . Artillerymen scuttled about them like blue cedes . We saw Clinton swing himself from his horse , pull at his breeches s if fearful they might have stuck to his fat legs , yawn cavernously , walk close to the four guns and stand there scratching his rump and king out across the valley toward the hills. l is had a good view , for the farmhouse was on a hill , and about in c center of the triangular tip of the island . Far to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Regiments were still pouring downm it , filling the slanting road through the wheatfields . Straight ahead of us , less than a mile away , the hills were notched what I knew to be the middle pass . If to the right the ridge of hills ran down into New York Bay ended in flat brown marshes cut by shining blue creeks and ts. mile to the rear were the log walls of the fort on Brooklyn ights  --  walls so silent that they seemed as useless as they did less. linton turned back to the farmhouse and thrust his head into an rear window . He seemed to like what he saw , for he called his s , went around to the door and vanished from our sight . The house was no longer a mere farmhouse . It was headquarters : sterious and awesome source of life and death , victory and de-e chaos of the crowded farmyard merged into something like r . Officers ' horses were led to a rail fence and picketed . The gun s , having arranged the four cannon to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knots of generals and lesser officers whispered together and constantly turned their heads to watch that newly glorified farmhouse . When another group of gaudily dressed officers rode into the yard , Clinton thrust his head from an upper window and shouted at them irascibly , as Vose Leighton had shouted at me and his sons when we , as little boys , disturbed him by our play . " Not here ! " he cried . " Do n't stop here ! Keep moving toward the bay ! Hurry up about it , unless you want the rebels to run clean around you and get away ! Go right on down to the water ! " Major generals and brigadier generals turned and stared indignantlyat the columns of infantry that had halted outside the yard . Young officers waved their arms and shouted . The columns shuffled forward . I saw the men wink at each other , secretly pleased by the irritation of Clinton and his generals , and knew they were in high spirits . Aides ran in and out of the farmhouse . One of them came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The general wants the prisoners well guarded , " the aide said . " They 'll be embarrassing if you do n't look out . He 's assigned Captain Evelyn of the dragoons to this duty , with a squad of dragoons , a field piece and two companiesof infantry . He says to put the camp between the main roads , so it 'll be easy to reach . " He saluted and hurried away . The hour was nine o'clock . From then on the battle of Long Island became for me a series of disconnected sketches  --  vignettes of heroism and desperation ; of cowardice and panic ; of stupidity and ignorance ; of a veritable travesty of war that made me ashamed for my rebellious countrymen , enemy to them though I was . P297ACTING on Cunningham 's orders , Stedman and I laid out the prisoners ' camp in a sort of amphitheater among knolls . We had is help of Captain Evelyn , who was young , a trifle stooped , and ttremely lackadaisical in his manner , as if he 'd never given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deceptive , for he seemedknow exactly what to do , as if by instinct . While we placed gun cw , dragoons and infantrymen at commanding posts around the lls , the lowland all around us was aswarm with scarlet-coated regiments . Cunningham viewed our labors complacently . " Grand , " he said , in Is oily voice . " A grand place for rebel prisoners ! If they try to escape , e can mow ' em down like cattle ! " His face was suddenly scarlet . See you do it , too ! If they show their teeth , give ' em a foot of bayonet in the ribs before they have a chance to bite ! " The flush left his face and he beamed upon us . " If you need me , ( 1 Inc at headquarters . " He turned on his heel and swaggered off , a c figure of a man , but one that I found increasingly repellent . I could n't have said when the battle began , any more than I would say when the distant rumble of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had hung so long above the two larded passes had grown louder and still louder . This , we knew , was because the British attack was being pressed on the opposite pcs of the ridge . The British forces were like the two blades of antic pair of scissors . We in the plain were one blade ; and the er , on the far side of the ridge , was doing some sharp cutting . Surprisingly , then , the sound of gunfire no longer came fromp298about the passes , but from the fields before us . Drifts of smoke appeared above the waiting scarlet regiments . The guns on the hillocks leaped as they bellowed . Then I saw the rebels coming down from the forest on the ridge  --  pouring out in tens , twenties , hundreds , uncountable hundreds ; unformed mobs , running , hiding in the wheat , taking shelter behind trees , dodging behind fences , all hurrying toward us , hopeful of passing us and reaching the rebel fort . At first the scarlet regiments held their formation . They were like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups of fleeing rebels . Then the scarlet regiments , too , broke apart , and the wheatfields at the foot of the hillslope were dotted with slow-moving red figures eddying at the edges of thickets , fumbling along ditches , prodding before them with bayonets , as men prod with pitchforks at new-cut hay . I knew the rebels were hiding in the fields ; the scarlet infantrymenhunting them through the wheat . The rebels were being destroyed : no doubt of that ; and for fifteen long months I 'd been hoping for such a thing to happen ; yet now that the destruction was taking place , I was conscious only of a consuming weariness : of an overwhelming desire to sleep a little , and to find , when I waked , that those scarlet battalions had forever vanished , that the long black guns did n't exist , that the sharp , thick taste of gunpowder was a thing of the past . The complete ruin of the rebels was what I 'd hoped for , but now I did n't want to see it ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running , hiding men were no longer the lunatics and bullies who had killed my father : they were just helpless Americans , as my father and I had been . The voices of our dragoons and infantrymen became shrill . I saw them pointing across the valley . Then Buell , surrounded by a throng of men on foot , came around a knoll and signaled to me . " Where do you want ' em , Oliver ? This is only the beginning of ' em ! The Hessians are driving ' em out of the hills like cattle ! " The men around Buell had the whipped look of vagabonds or idlers . Their faces were unshaven , their coats tied to their belts with rawhidethongs or hazel shoots . They wore ancient leather breeches , sweat-stained hickory shirts . The stockings of those who had stockingshung wrinkled around their shoe tops . There were thirty-seven of them.  | " Do you mean to say , " I asked Buell , " that only thirty-seven Irisoners were taken in that first charge ? " " Thirty-seven 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run like rabbits ! They dodged back into the woods and ran around us , over to the middle pass . You 'll get ' em in bigger bunches pretty quick . " Captain Evelyn rode up behind me , followed by his squad of dragoons . " Good God , " Evelyn said , " these are n't soldiers , are they ? " Buell slid groaningly off his horse , and felt tenderly of his buttocks . " Everybody claims they 're soldiers , including themselves , " Buell said , " so I guess they must be . " " If they 're soldiers , how 'd it happen no officers were captured with them ? " Evelyn asked . Buell looked surprised . " Good land , Captain , most of ' em are leers ! " He pointed to a sour-faced man chewing a blade of grass . hat there 's a lieutenant colonel . " He indicated another with fat , d cheeks , a rosebud of a mouth , and clubbed hair tied with a bootcc . " That there 's a major . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most of those with stockings are officers . " Evelyn , his gorget , brass buttons , saber and regimental insignia littering like newly burnished gold against the scarlet of his uniform , ked incredulous ; then saluted the lieutenant colonel and the major . ortunes of war , gentlemen , " he said . " You 're well out of it , if you n't mind my saying so . " The rebel officers eyed him stonily . Evelyn turned a questioning glance upon Buell . " These men are ightened , " he said . " Did anything happen to ' em while you were inging ' em in ? " Buell looked disgusted . " Not a damned thing . On the way over re we passed those two companies of New York Volunteers  --  the es that came to Halifax in May . They still ai n't got any clothes , and these fellers had been wearing anything decent , they 'd ' a ' undressed . Can I go back and watch the Hessians chase the rebels , Oliver ? " When he left me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behave youryes , " I told them , " you 'll be well treated , and at the earliest opportunity you 'll be exchanged . If you do n't behave yourselves  --  if you to escape or disarm your guards  --  you 'll have to take the conse-ences . " They stared up at me as if they did n't propose to understand . Glyn leaned on the pommel of his saddle , staring down at these rry-looking soldiers . " No offense meant , Colonel , " he said , " but I'd very much like to know how you came to find yourselves in such a precarious position this morning . " The colonel looked sullen . " It wa' n't our fault if we did n't have enough men ! You had five times what we did . That 's all there was to it ! " " I 'm afraid that explanation does n't go back far enough , " Evelyn said . " I 'm particularly interested in knowing how your army came to be on Long Island . What puzzles me is how your general thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against a vastly superior force free to attack where it pleased . Good God , gentlemen , your thirty-mile lines were open to attack on the rear , both flanks and the front , and on top of that they were cut in two by a navigable channel ! " The prisoners just looked angry . Evelyn took off his shining dragoon 's helmet and scratched his curly fair hair . " I 'm really interested , you know . We 've had strange generals in our own army  --  got us into all sorts of uncomfortable fixes , I 'm free to admit ; but this beats anything I ever heard ! Why , no matter where we chose to attack , gentlemen , we had you ! You had no possible way of stopping us ! You had only a third as many troops as we , and most of them militia , untrained and unreliable . You had no ships , no artillery , no cavalry . Think of it , gentlemen ! No cavalry ! It was an army without eyes ! We could have gone up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river as with a broom ! I wish you 'd give me an inkling , as one soldier to another , why your general should have tried to hold New York in the first place ! Why should he have come over here to Brooklyn when he lacked half enough troops to do it properly ? Why did he divide those troops in such a way that we cut you in two , as we 're doing at this moment ? " The rebels were gray-faced . " Just because we 're prisoners , " the colonel said , " ai n't no reason to insult us ! General Washington 's in command of this army , I 'll have you know ! " Evelyn looked pained . " My dear good man , I have n't the slightest wish to insult you ! I 'm a soldier , deeply interested in military strategy and tactics . No matter who your general is , his blunders today have been monumental ! I feel free to say so , just as I 'd feel free to criticize miserable leadership in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miserable leadership ! I do n't know how much of an army your generalwill have left in a week 's time ; but I 'm sure it wo n't be large  --  and that , gentlemen , will be exactly what he deserves . "  |p301One  of the prisoners spat the word " parricide " at him . Evelyn looked puzzled . " Parricide ? Parricide ? You mean I 'm in rebellion against my parents , intending to be their assassin ? " " No , no , " I said , and explained , for I 'd heard the epithet before . " It 's a little peculiar ; parricide 's ' just a word they have for everybody not on their side . They know it means something unpleasant , but hcy 're not etymologists . " He nodded , murmured " parricide " ruminatively , and gathered up is reins . " How do you want these prisoners handled , Mr. Wiswell ? Let 's not waste time on ' em when we can see the finish of Mr. Washgton'sarmy from one of these knolls . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " Keep the officers t one end of the camp , the men at the other . The men should be ivided into small groups , so they can be easily questioned . " Evelyn repeated my wishes to his dragoons , and added sharply , It they attempt to escape , they 're no longer prisoners : they 're rebels and enemies . You 'll order them to halt ; and if they do n't halt , use our sabers . If that does n't stop ' em , they 're to be left to the infantry . ( peat these orders to every new group of prisoners as they 're rought in . " When my duties permitted , and I 'd sent my first reports in to linton 's headquarters , I was glad to follow Evelyn to the high ound that rimmed the camp  --  glad to get away from the rebel risoners . They were sullenly bitter , angrily resentful of any attempt be friendly . They seemed to revel in churlishness and ignorance . When I stood on the hilltop with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadily contracting ring of musketry fire . Evelyn made faint sounds of wonderment . " By God , " he said , there 's a sight you would n't see in a dozen wars ! " The wheatfields between us and the range of hills were covered ith moving figures and fleecy puffs that bloomed and faded . The od of War might have come down from Olympus and with a lavish and sown toy soldiers and balls of cotton from end to end of those irtd meadows . The upper fields were covered with blue-coated Hessians ; the lower olds dotted with scarlet infantrymen . Between those two loose bands scarlet and blue were hundreds upon hundreds of dun-colored tires  --  rebels , caught between the Hessians and the infantry . They : firmed confusedly up and down between the scarlet band and the tic band , like frightened minnows in a ditch.  |p302We  could see them hide in the wheat ; then rise and run again . Wherever we looked we saw those dun-colored figures , running , running , running ; saw groups of them surrounded and engulfed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the spectacle . " We 've caught the whole center and left of the rebel army , and I 'm not there ! Look at those Hessians stab the wheat with their bayonets ! There 's a whole army being wiped out ; and here I am , standing on a hill , guarding prisoners ! " " You really think the rebels are caught ? " Stedman asked . " Is n't it possible they might escape somehow ? " Evelyn looked shocked . " Escape ? How can they ? The whole left and center 's gone ! Those men out there are nothing but a panicstruckmob , as good as dead or captured , right this minute ! " " I hope to God there 's no mistake this time , " Buell said . " I want to get back to my geese ! " Evelyn turned to look toward the shimmering waterways of the marsh at the extreme right . Near the edge of that marsh , scarlet columns were deployed in the fields , waiting . " It 's true , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come out of the hills ; but when it does , it 'll be trapped just as the left and center have been . " Around the shoulder of a near-by knoll streamed a procession of rebel prisoners . They came toward us in squads and straggling groups . Some were herded along by infantrymen ; some watched over by Hessian officers ; some guarded by dragoons with drawn sabers . Some , I even thought , were urged onward by women ; and although I knew it was n't possible , I imagined I saw the women striking with sticks at those they escorted . When I went down to meet them , I began to fear that our camp was too small for our prisoners ; that all of Long Island would be needed to hold them ; that not even an entire regiment of infantry would be sufficient to guard them . They poured between the sentries in an endless stream , haggard , wretchedly clothed , soiled beyond words . They had bayonet wounds in their buttocks , in the backs of their legs . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their pale faces streaked with sweat . They seemed unwilling to look at their companions , much less at us , their captors . Buell forced his horse through the line of draggled , white-faced prisoners and drew up beside me . He flung a gracious word to thoseP303he had just left . " All right , boys . You 're safe now ! Do n't be worried ! 1 wo n't let the Hessians do anything to you . " He turned back to me , and his face was serious . " Christ , Oliver , " he whispered , " I do n't want to see anything like that again ! " Ile mopped his forehead with his sleeve . " They were n't men any longer , Oliver ! They were just animals , squeaking and running ! There was n't hardly a one of ' em that lifted his hand to save himself or anyone else . " He lowered his voice . " I 'm kind of ashamed to tell- you what I 1w , Oliver . We 've captured regiments from all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , New Jersey ; and no matter here they came from , they were all alike ! They ran and they ran ! hey hid under bushes , and tried to crawl into fox holes . If ever an officer tried to make ' em stop and fight , they squealed like scared oodchucks under a wall ! The women camp followers went out ) m our baggage train with clubs , kicked those Patriots out from c wheat and took ' em prisoner ! " He shook his head . " Patriots ! Do n't it beat hell , Oliver , the labels men put on themselves ? " He was silent and so was I. We sat there together , watching the pallid prisoners hurry past the sentries and into the campground , like t souls crowding with a sort of miserable relief toward Charon 's ry . The rout of the rebel left and center was an overwhelming one ; t it was drab by comparison with the drama when the rebel right ng , at noon , came down off the ridge and set out to skirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brooklyn Heights . watched it with Evelyn , Stedman and Buell from the highest knoll the rear of the prisoners ' camp ; and rebel officers , one by one , e out from the hundreds of silent prisoners to mount the knollstand near us , staring and muttering . What they saw made them k sick , and no wonder ; for this was the end of all their schemesall their labor  --  an ignominious end brought upon them by reckleaders . The road down which the rebels poured ran in a half-circle around marsh . Abreast of that half-circle were our light infantry regits , grenadiers , Highlanders , squads of dragoons and a dozen y guns. e rebels themselves had a different look from those who had c down from the center pass ; for they marched in formation instead of running in a mob ; and even when the heavy guns and the infantry and the Highlanders opened fire on them , the marching battalions held together as long as was humanly possible . Evelyn turned and looked down at the rebel officers who stood near him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked . Not a rebel would answer . " Move up ahead of us if you ca n't see , gentlemen , " Evelyn said . " That brown regiment 's going to attack ! " He leaned forward to tap one of the prisoners on the shoulder . " I beg your pardon , " he said , " but that regiment in brown 's behaving extremely well , you know ! " The prisoner ignored him . Evelyn raised his eyebrows . " Come , come , gentlemen : I 'm not trying to pry military secrets from you . I 'd like to give credit where it 's due , that 's all . " " They 're Smallwood 's Maryland battalion , " one of the officers said huskily . " Maryland , eh ? " Evelyn said . " Well , they 'll never see Maryland again ! They 're attacking Cornwallis ' whole division , so to give the others a chance to escape . Too bad ! Too bad ! They 're brave men , and this 'll be the end of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown battalion marched against the long curved line of scarlet regiments as smoothly as any body of men ever moved on parade ; and far behind them the throng of rebels that had come out of the hills ran desperately to save themselves . They straggled down from the wheatfields into the marsh ; floundered through the pools and mud and winding watercourses ; plunged headlong into the creek that curved through it like a silver sickle . In defense of the fleeing hundreds the little brown column came on and on . The scarlet line toward which it moved jetted smoke ; the guns on the hillocks wreathed themselves in fleecy clouds ; the brown column seemed about to be engulfed and overwhelmed in thunderings . The marsh beyond that little column crawled with retreating men . We could see them leaping from tussock to tussock ; sinking in the mud to their knees when they missed their footing ; plunging to their armpits in the marsh pools and beating the water to get free ; blunderingin the creek , vanishing in deep water , struggling onward with flailing arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Probably , likeP305myself , each one watched with strained muscles the fortunes of one out of those hundreds who labored in the marsh . " He ca n't get out , " Buell shouted in my ear . " Look there , Oliver ! It 's up to his shoulders ! Up to his neck ! Christ , Oliver , it 's into his mouth  --  into his mouth  --  " I did n't see the man Buell saw , but I saw another  --  saw him too Clearly . He labored through a marsh pool ; fell in a hidden waterway and slowly emerged ; rested awhile on hands and knees ; painfully osc ; gropingly gathered up his musket and knapsack . I could imagine the heavy mud upon his legs , and how it stank ; c sweat in his eyes ; the dryness of his throat , holding air from s lungs . Almost I could hear him gasp for breath . He swayed on the brink of the creek ; fell forward into the water , sloundered to his feet and stood thigh-deep in the stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his waist ; up to his chest . When it ached his armpits , he stood motionless , looking upstream and wnstream at his fleeing fellows . Then he struck out for himself , swimming slowly . I was sure he uld n't make it ; for as he swam he rolled like a sick fish . When his d dipped under , I knew he was done , though his arms made imming motions still . After that his head came up once ; his armsand fell . Then he was gone , and I found myself standing in my raps and shouting , as if hopeful of persuading one of those dis-t fugitives to save that dying man . The rebel officers around us stared dejectedly at that thunderous panorama  --  at the dark little figures wallowing across the marsh indirection of the fort ; at the curved lines of troops on the inner c of the marsh ; at the scarlet regiments hurrying to overtake thosehad passed the marsh and were straggling toward the earthkson the Heights. c brown battalion had re-formed in the shelter of a grove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The end of all this fused marching and running and banging , I felt , was near , and my rt heat harder. vclyn walked his horse out in front of the rebel officers . " I 'll ask to go down with the rest of the prisoners , " he told them . " Your lc army 's on the run , and the prisoners might start running too . your duty to see they do n't . If they should , we 'd be bound to'cm , and you would n't want that to happen . " nprotestingly those hatless men in soiled shirts and homespun breeches slowly gave ground , but their eyes remained fixed until the last possible moment on the brown battalion marching against the guns and the long scarlet lines . I could n't turn my gaze from those brown lines . Their advance slowed ; the lines seemed to thicken and thin . They wavered and swirled ; and then , in a moment , there were no ranks at all : only a mass of brown figures running away , running toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had opposed them began to move , as if stirred to life by the flight of the men in brown . The guns on the hillocks stirred and crawled like black beetles toward the Heights of Brooklyn . The scarlet lines ringing the marsh straightened and set off past the lumbering guns , all pointing toward that silent fort upon the Heights . I turned to Buell . " Well , Tom , they 're getting what they deserve , I suppose . When I think of all they did to my father and to you and to all those others in Boston  --  " I saw he was n't listening . He was staring at the rebel officers movingback toward the throng of prisoners in the amphitheater below . " What 's the matter ? " I asked . " I ai n't sure , " Buell said . " One of those fellers does n't look quite right . From the way he 's eyeing you , I sort of thought he might have a pistol in his pocket  --  and might be thinking of using it on you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rearmost of the rebel officers , staring at me with a look so like Sally 's that it wrung my heart , was my boyhood friend , Sally Leighton 's brother Soame . P307A FAMILIAR face from home , even that of a bitter enemy , expectedly seen in strange surroundings , brings pleasure , at least r the first moment , to any man  --  which proves , I suppose , that all en are well disposed toward one another by nature , and only hate ten poisoned by ignorance , stupidity , knavery , lies , sickness , love war . If Soame Leighton had , in days gone by , been nothing more than neighbor , my heart would have leaped at sight of him ; but he was vastly more than that . He was Sally 's brother , and in my excitement , en I saw him , I shouted his name as though he were still myrest friend and not a sympathizer , at least , with the mob that had ' veil my father and me from Milton. swung myself from the saddle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him by the shoulder . " Soame , " I cried , " why n't you tell me you were here ? Are you hurt ? Are you all t ? " c pulled away . " If it 's all the same to you , Oliver , do n't bother ut me . Just let me alone . " onsense , Soame ! " I protested . " We 've been friends ! Nobody 's g to be such a fool as to think hard thoughts of you because of your friends holds different opinions . " same glanced at the other rebel officers who stood near us , seem-y oblivious of our conversation . To me he said , " Different ions ! Is that what you call it when you try to stab your mother he heart ? " afraid I laughed . " Listen to me , Soame , " I urged . " People ' t stop being civilized human beings because they 're at war ! "   Soame looked at me oddly . " Do n't talk to me , Oliver ! Please do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be under suspicion of being friends with Tories and traitors . " To my distress his face twisted , reddened , seemed to swell ; tears welled into his eyes and ran down his cheeks . " By God , Oliver , we are n't friends any more ! " He sounded half strangled . " You 're on their side , and they hit us from behind ! They did n't fight fair ! Then those damned Hessians came up the hill on the other side , and down on us through the woods ! They pinned our men to trees with bayonets ! I saw one of ' em stick a bayonet clean through Allan Sawyer 's stomach and into a maple ! You knew Allan Sawyer ! He lived in Rox-bury ! " The other rebel officers were listening , their faces hard and hating . " What are bayonets for ? " Buell asked . " You have ' em , do n't you ? " " Be still , Tom , " I said . Buell sat straighter in his saddle . " Why should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a traitor for trying to save his country from Sam Adams  --  from people who kill you if you do n't think the way they do ! How are we traitors for being loyal to our government instead of joining the mobs ? And what 's unfair about attacking an army in a place it forgot to protect itself ? What made these Patriots start a war if they wanted to have everything their own way  --  if they only wanted to fight according to their own rules ? That ai n't the way wars are fought ! " The rebel officers looked murder and sudden death at Buell , and the stupidity of this rage of theirs irritated me . " That 's the unfortunate truth , " I told them . " You gentlemen are officers , supposedly able to recognize military facts when you see them . You 've been outgeneraled and outfought , but you 're trying to put the blame everywhere except where it belongs  --  which is on yourselves and your generals . I 'll have to ask you not to insult our intelligencein such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me alone with Mr. Leighton . " Buell handed me my horse 's reins , and the soiled and draggled officers moved away before me without a word , their faces still defiant ; and Soame , left alone with me , stared at the ground . " Soame , " I said , " I 'd help any Milton man , even if I did n't know him well . But you are n't just a Milton man , Soame : you 're Sally'sP309brother ! Even if you do n't want to be helped , I 'm going to help you . I low 's Sally , Soame ? " " Just a little fool , " Soame said . " Your property 's seized ; and if you come back to Milton , you 'll be shot if you 're caught . You 're worse than dead , and yet she wo n't give you up ! She 's turned nun over a man she 'll never live with  --  a man who is n't an American any more ! " Guns were booming , muskets rattling , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a moment of sheer delight . " Thank you , Soame , " I said . " I 'll chance being shot when I come home to Milton , and of Sally 's never living with me ! " Look at this battlefield around us ! Every last rebel regiment onthe run ! Before night all that 's left of General Washington 's troops ill have the British Navy on one side of ' em and Howe 's whole army on the other ! Did Sally give you a message for me , Soame , case I happened to be the one that got captured ? By God , I believe e did ! Where is it ? " " She never expected we 'd lose this battle , " Soame said . " She never ught we 'd be stabbed in the back , as we have been . " " Where 's her message , Soame ? " I said again . Soame sounded bewildered . " Nobody thought we 'd be beaten , iver . Nobody thought the troops of a foreign tyrant could win from I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't understand how it hapcd ! " His anger returned . " If I 'd known it would be this way , never have let Sally write you ! If she 'd persisted , I would n't have tied it ! " " Yes , but she did , Soame ! And what 's more , you carried it . Give to me ! " Reluctantly he brought out a little wad of paper , black with dirt nil moist with perspiration . I left Soame and went to the top of the knoll where I could be alone . e far-off roads on both sides were filled with troops , marching and the fort on Brooklyn Heights . The fields were sprinkled with iinents re-forming to the sound of distant drumbeats after their n hunt through the wheat . The cannonading and musketry fire d ceased , and the sound of far-off drums was like the humming of myriad of hornets . As I worked with shaking fingers to unfold the worn and grimy r , I was only dimly aware of that confused , tumultuous landpc . I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar pallor had come upon the groves and fields , preluding an approaching storm  --  but I had Sally 's letter ! It was written in pencil . " Dearest Oliver : " Was anything ever so torn as this poor heart in my breast ! All about me are unhappy people , telling me that I should be happy too in the triumph of the good cause ; and so I should be , Oliver dear , did I not too well know what that cause 's triumph means to you . Washington'ssoldiers have sworn to die rather than permit the troops of a foreign tyrant to occupy so much as one inch of American soil ; and my father says that this splendid army of Washington 's is unconquerable ; and so by now , as all aver , the armed forces with which you , dear Oliver , are associated must be flying in defeat , or prisoners . " Oh , Oliver ! Can I rejoice when I know how black this hour 's defeatmust be for you ! Were it not for that , I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the sea by the brave defenders of our soil . I hear the word glorious ' a dozen times an hour , and children run huzza-ing up and down the road  --  and so would I if I knew that you were safe and coming home ! " All my brothers have promised me upon their sacred honor that if you are among the prisoners , no harm shall come to you . " Oliver , I have felt the answer to my prayers for you . Those prayers have been so constant and so deep , 1 know the worst thing that can have happened to you is that you are prisoner . Assurance from on High has told me so . Something flutters in my throat when I think that you will not be long a captive ; for this great victory of General Washington 's will end the war ; and then kindness and understandingand peace will take the place of the clash of arms . The great cloud of anger will roll away and all men will be friends again . Righteousnessand mercy will prevail in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This hour will be dark for you . Let me share its darkness with you ; but believe me when I tell you that the dawn is coming fast . I know that you have done what your conscience bade you do . You have struggled for the right as you saw the right , and I could not be prouder of you . " To think the war is over ! To you , Oliver , it may seem that you will come home defeated ; but there is one poor heart to whom you will come as its victor , and in triumph . It is the heart of your " Sally . " P311Dear , dear Sally ! Sweet , faithful , understanding Sally ! I folded the letter , buttoned it tightly against my heart , came back to Soame and put my arm across his shoulder . " Soame , ' I said , " you 've been misled . Those who started this war told you you 'd got to defend your homes against a foreign tyrant . You did n't have to do anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to defend your home against me ; but they kept at you till you believedwhat they told you . Then they sat comfortably and safely in heir houses while you tried to fight without proper food or guns r clothes  --  and without knowing how to fight ! You 've been sadly recieved , but your troubles are almost over  --  and so , I think , areinc . I 'll see what can be done , Soame , so do n't  --  " Soame , I suddenly found , was staring beyond me with a look I new of old  --  a look that meant he did n't like what he saw . I turned to see Captain Cunningham close behind me , a queer halfsmileupon his ruddy face . " Well , " he said , " is n't this a little unusual nemies falling on each other 's neck during a battle ? " " Captain , " I said , " you 're just the man I want to see . I was going headquarters this minute to look for you . " " Good enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ght conceal the communication that just passed between this  --  ntleman and you ! " " Communication ? " I said blankly . Then I realized he was speaking Sally 's letter . " That was n't a communication , Captain . That is to , it was wholly private . I mean  --  Look here , Captain , do n't misderstandthis ! Captain Leighton 's an old friend of mine . He 's a neighbor from Milton . " " All yes , " Cunningham said . " And for months , no doubt , he 's been vying a letter for you ! " He seemed genuinely amused . " That 's un- , to say the least , Mr. Wiswell . Suppose you let me glance at thisr  --  this harmless personal letter . " oes he go through your pockets each night ? " Soame asked me pleasantly . Il the ruddy color in Cunningham 's face paled to a greenish yel- , then reddened rapidly . " Oh , " he said , " so that 's the tone a rebel s when he 's stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's voice was careless . " That 's the tone any man takes when he rs a friend insulted . " unningham 's eyes were like our blue New England marl that s the sharpest drills . " Wiswell , " he said , " your duty 's to keep prisoners from escaping  --  to prevent ' em murdering us or any more of our men : not to put your arms around their necks and accept documents from ' em . I 'll have a look at the paper this man gave you . " I wondered if I could be hearing him correctly . I looked at my hand and saw it was really mine . Everything around me was real : the sky was a heavy gray , and the wind ; which had backed into the northeast , was moist and cold against my face  --  sure sign of a northeaster . The prisoners below us in the camp were huddled in the center of the amphitheater ; and I could hear the idle talk and laughter of the dragoons and infantrymen who guarded them . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shots and the occasional thudding roar of a great gun . No : nothing was unreal . Soame was real , my letter from Sally certainly was real , Cunningham was real , and he really had said what I thought I 'd heard him say . " You ca n't have it , " I told him . " It 's a personal letter . " I had a momentary glimpse , in Cunningham 's eyes , of something I did n't understand : something dark and inhuman , unlike anything within my experience . Yet he seemed to dismiss the matter . " Tut , tut , " he said lightly , " you Americans are too damned serious ! That's. dangerous , Mr. Wiswell ! Some day we might misunderstand each other . " I was too confused to do more than gawp at him like any country bumpkin . " You said you were on your way to headquarters to see me , " Cunninghamwent on . " No doubt you wanted special favors for your friend here . Was that it , Mr. Wiswell ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " " Ah yes , " Cunningham said , " a parole . Well , Mr. Wiswell , run along to headquarters and see what they 'll do for you there . See the general . " His eyes twinkled good-naturedly . " Do n't do it , Oliver , " Soame said . " This battle 's not over yet . Do n't ask a soldier anything in the middle of a battle : he does n't know what he 's doing . " The chameleonlike changes in Cunningham 's manner had frightened me . I swung myself into the saddle and leaned forward to shake Soame 's hand . " I 'll be back as soon as I can , " I said . " The war 'll be over tomorrow and we 'll go back to Milton together . " P313THE FARMHousE that Clinton had chosen as his headquarters had been neat as a pin when I had left it at nine o'clock in theorning . Now , three hours later , it seemed on the verge of rack nd ruin . Why war soils and disarranges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farmyard around headquarters was a sample of what war does in almost the twinkling of an eye . Horse droppings were everywhere : the air stank of ammonia , sweat , ancidness . The once-grassy yard had been chopped and churned to dust and mud ; and half-embedded in its puddinglike surface ere bread crusts , old shoes , scraps of paper , bits of harness , chicken Lathers , hats , empty powder bags , stray stockings , broken belts , oiled rags . In one corner of the yard was a dead horse , and against he front steps of the farmhouse lay the body of a cat . War does similar things to men 's brains . I expected , when I rode among the officers , aides , commissaries and angers-on who thronged that soiled and cluttered enclosure , to see cry face wreathed in smiles ; to find the gaiety of victory on every de ; to find General Howe flushed with success and glad to give c a parole for Soame Leighton . Instead of that , the whole company had a stricken look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indignant . A few , openly ragg , seemed upon the verge of apoplexy . A knot of officers , Stedman among them , stared silently at a capinin their midst . The captain 's contorted face was streaked with lid and powder stains ; his scarlet jacket , beneath his arms and between his shoulder blades , was almost black with sweat ; his bootsI were clay-stained , scratched as if by matted brambles . Around every button and buckle on his boots and breeches wisps of redtop had tightly wound themselves . His voice , when he spoke to those about him , shook and was shrill , so that I thought he must be either drunk or mentally affected by what he 'd been through . " God damn it , " he shouted , " ca n't someone make it clear to him ? We can walk right into their bloody God-damned fort and hack ' em to pieces with bayonets ! He ca n't stop us now ! He 's got no right to order us back when we 're on the verge of wiping ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silent officers before him . " For Christ 's sake , Colonel , ca n't you talk to him ? Ca n't somebody talk to him ? We 've earned a victory over these damned rebels , and he 's got no right to keep us from it ! " The colonel stared at him with eyes like oysters . " The general 's issued his orders , Captain . No assault 's to be made on the fort toay . The captain 's voice was almost a scream . " But my men were practicallyin the fort ! Ten regiments could have walked in there withoutlosing a man ! Does n't the general want to finish this war , for Christ 's sake ? " The colonel eyed him stonily . " I suggest you be more guarded in your speech , Captain . Not even a victory like this one gives us immunity from court-martials . " " Victory be damned ! " the captain shouted . " Where 's the victory if enough rebels get away to fight again ? There 's still part of an army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as they are . Washington 's there ; Putnam 's there ! For God 's sake , Colonel , I beg of you to make a personal plea to General Howe ! We 've got seven hours of daylight to wipe ' em out ! " A score of voices chorused approval . " He 's right ! " " The captain 's right ! " " Do n't give ' em time to recover ! " " Wipe ' em out this after-noon ! " All the cannonading and excitement of the past fifteen hours seemed to have addled my brain . I understood the words I heard , but could n't seem to grasp their meaning . I even forgot I had come here to get help for Soame Leighton . I climbed from my horse and drew Stedman from the circle of officers around the angry young captain . He looked both exasperated and contemptuous . " What happened ? " I asked . " Is Clinton dead ? Howe 'd never takep315the command away from him , would he , considering how Clinton 's plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief , " Stedman said . " Howe 's commander in chief . A commander in chief ca n't let a subordinate general get credit for a victory . " The oyster-eyed colonel was talking again . " I suggest , Captain , that you return to your command without loss of time and withdraw from in front of the fort . I heard the general 's orders . Our lines at ell points must be at least seven hundred yards from the rebel out-posts . " The captain thrust his clenched fist within an inch of the colonel 's ( ) tie . " God all bloody mighty , Colonel ! The general ca n't undertandwhat 's happened out there ! Those rebels are huddled into their rt like hens in a barn with a fox outside ! There is n't a blasted thing cy can do to stop us , Colonel ! I swear to God that when I got c general 's orders and halted my men , they damn near trampled er me ! Some of ' em were so mad , they cried ! " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound . His own eyelids , I saw , were red and puffy : his eyes shining with angry tears . Stedman looked at me and lifted his hands in a gesture of helpssness . " I still do n't understand , " I said . " What 's General Howe 's reason r not attacking ? " Stedman snorted . " He 's mentioned several . One is the fort 's so sy to take , he 'd be wasting lives if he assaulted it . He prefers to ke it by regular approaches . " " Regular approaches ! " I cried . " What 's he mean by that ? " Stedman shook his head . " I 'm not sure . I think he means he prersto wait for the warships to sail upstream until they 're between cw York and Brooklyn , in a position to bombard the fort at short nge . Then those in the fort 'll have to surrender or be blown to pieces . " But the wind 's northeast , " I said . " Does n't the general know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind backs into c northeast after a beautiful clear day like yesterday , we 're in for a northeaster ? Does n't he know a northeaster usually blows three days ometimes five  --  at this time of year ? " he group of officers turned to listen. he colonel spoke up sharply . " What difference would it make if he did know it ? He 's sent out repeated orders not to attack that fort today ! He ca n't rescind those orders . " " Why not , for God 's sake ? " I asked . " Why ca n't he rescind them ? If a northeaster blows four or five days , his ships ca n't possibly get up the river to help him ! He 'll have to lie right where he is , sopping wet . He ca n't move ! " " Neither can the rebels , " the colonel said . " What makes you think they ca n't ? You did n't expect ' em to occupy Bunker Hill , but they did ! You did n't think they 'd fortify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave Boston as a result . " The colonel grunted , then favored me with a view of his back . The young captain looked imploringly at the colonel , made a muffled sound of disgust , turned on his heel and went to his picketed horse . Two sullen-faced aides bolted from the farmhouse door and ran - toward their own horses . The captain looked hopefully at them . " Any change in orders ? " " Yes , " one of the aides said . " Do n't be so long moving back from in front of that fort ! How many times do you have to be told to move back before you move back ? The general says he 'll have someone court-martialed if all regiments do n't move back as ordered . " The two young men swung into their saddles and clattered out of the farmyard . The captain climbed heavily onto his horse , gathered up his reins and followed dejectedly , bent over in his saddle , as though suffering from a stomach-ache  --  which I have no doubt he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers in the farmyard stared at the ground . I smothered my inclination to curse these imperturbable Englishmen  --  tospeak my mind about a general who could order his army to sit idle all through an August afternoon , while the fruits of a hardwonvictory rotted before his eyes . I 'd have to wait until tomorrow , I knew , before speaking to the general about Soame Leighton . Rain began to fall at dusk . By nine o'clock at night a northeaster whipped sheets of wetness into our faces ; and when the sad dawn of August twenty-eighth broke , the waiting army on either side of us was obscured in gray veils of moisture that thickened , thinned and thickened . P317The rebel fort , less than a mile away , was wholly lost behind cursinsof rain . There were no tents for the prisoners ; no tents for the army ; no fires for cooking . How any infantryman , exposed to that downpour , kept his powder dry was beyond my understanding . Yet some did ; for all through the day men worked at digging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the diggers Mere supported by infantrymen who kept up a continual spatter of musketry fire . From the fort , too , came answering musketry fired the occasional roar of a great gun . An infantry regiment stood guard in the rain around our prisoners ; d Buell , Stedman and I sheltered ourselves as best we could in a tie woodchuck-hole of a cave we had dug near the top of the knoll . " If Howe stays here long enough , " Buell said , " he might learnething about America . Bunker Hill taught him not to attack in nt , and it looks as if he 'd never forget that lesson . Now he 's ruing about northeasters , , " Stedman said . " Teaching an Englishman about erica is like teaching a foolish girl how to be a good wife . A foolish 1 might learn to have supper on time ; learn to laugh whenever her ' hand said something he thought was funny ; but she 'd forget not he angry when her husband spoke lightly of her mother . If Howe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget ething else . " (  --  hat was the truth of it . All through the twenty-eighth the rain prickled down our necks , filled our nostrils with the musty odor of y wool , made our shoes into water buckets in which our feet squelched and felt shriveled . Ul through that night we dozed fitfully in waterlogged restless- ' . UI through the twenty-ninth drifting rain poured down from y clouds caught like smoke in the tops of trees. ghat night the rain stopped . Stedman , making his rounds of the loners ' camp at dawn on August thirtieth , woke us with good s . " The wind 's shifting , " he told us . " There 's a fog over every- , and it smells of the sea . We 'll get ' em today ! " crawled from our shelter and went to the top of the knoll . Everything around me was shrouded in a cottony mist smelling of arms and wet mud .   While I stood listening and trying to see through that vaporous blanket , I heard , far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thick and cottony as if fired beneath pillows . A drum beat with a ghostly quality , as if the drum were filled with water . There were more musket shots , and a hurried spongy thumping from other distant drums . Buell came to stand beside me , yawning cavernously . He listened to the drums , tilting his head this way and that . " Hell , Oliver , " he said , " there 's something wrong ! There 's a regiment moving out  --  movingtoward the rebel fort . They 're hollering ! That ai n't right , is it ? They would n't be letting the rebels know they were coming , would they ? " I knew he was right . There was something sinister about the silence of the rebel fort . Why , when the rain had stopped , when dawn had come , when drums were beating and regiments were noisily on the march  --  why , at such a time , should that fort and those lines from which muskets had rattled all through the drenching rain of the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead ? An aide materialized from the fog and made for the entrance to the camp , his horse 's hoofs making sucking sounds in the churned mud of the path . I ran toward him ; and when I reached his side he leaned down to whisper his message , as if fearful that some of the prisoners might hear . " You 're to take special precautions with the prisoners , " he said . " The rebels got away ! All of ' em got away ! " I did n't believe him . " They all got away ? They could n't ! " " They all got away , " he repeated . " They crossed the river to New York in rowboats last night and this morning . There is n't one of ' e left . Not one ! " " You mean to say the whole rebel army got away ? That all those men escaped across the river without General Howe 's knowing anything about it ? " The aide 's voice was suddenly exasperated . " That 's exactly what I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " P319THE escape of all the rebels , in the very moment of their overwhelming defeat , sent every man in Howe 's army into a despairfury . The entire rebel army had been routed , their generals had n cornered and revealed as utterly incompetent , their rebellionbeen crushed  --  and then , thanks to the sudden stubborn insensitivityof General Howe and of General Howe alone , the cornered fly , the helpless generals , had escaped : the crushed rebellion was lin alive ; and all the efforts , all the bravery of the troops Howe led , had gone for nothing . Even worse was the despair of the Loyalists . The two companies few York Volunteers who had unprotestingly gone cold , hungry , unclothed for months in anticipation of this day , and fought so ntly against the rebels that Howe had commended them in his crs , were like men in a daze . They acted stunned , as if they'dhit on the head . The same thing , we heard , was true of the usands of persecuted families on Long Island , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Connecticut and Rhode Island . ell spoke weakly enough for all of us when he put some of the me on Mrs. Loring . " My God , " he cried , " we 'll never win a battle Icss we do some woman-killing first ! Howe ca n't go anywhere do anything without going back to see what Mrs. Loring 's doing ! In Mrs. Loring ! Damn her blue eyes ; damn her lips ; damn her little switch-tail ! Ai n't it a hell of a thing to think that if she'dten years older , and her bottom ten inches bigger , Howe Id n't ' a ' looked at her , and the war 'd been over ! s'pose there 'll be statues some day to the noble heroes that got rebels out of a hole at the battle of Long Island  --  to General Washington , who put ' em in the hole to begin with , and that old blatherskite Putnam , and all those damned fool generals who hid under fences in the wheatfields ; but they ai n't the ones who ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damned thing for the rebels at the battle of Long Island except General Howe and Mrs. Loring , and nobody else ought to have a statue ! " Yes , Oliver , I suppose there ought to be one statue of Mrs. Loring squeezing the last drop of champagne out of one of the general 's wine bottles , and another of her squeezing the general while the rebels escape . " The truth is , Oliver , that up to now Mrs. Loring 's done ten times as much for the rebels as all their generals and Congresses and regimentsput together ! Why , damn it , Oliver , there would n't be any rebel generals or army except for Mrs. Loring ! If there 'd been two Mrs. Lorings , the rebels would have King George in a cage on Boston Common , with little boys poking sticks at him , by this time ! Damned . if I do n't think it would be a mighty patriotic act to send her a bottle of champagne with something in it , like the Borgia family used to do to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less pessimistic . " They still ca n't get away , " he insisted . " They 'll try to hold New York , and it just ca n't be held . Howe made a terrible blunder when he refused to let the fort be attacked ; but he ca n't make that mistake again . The next time he corners ' em , he 'll wipe ' em out ; and he 's bound to corner ' em in New York if they try to stay there . " The story of the night retreat of the rebel army from Brooklyn , as Stedman learned it , was almost unbelievable . General Washington sent a regiment of Marblehead men to scour the waterfront of New . York for rowboats . That regiment of skiffs and dories , rowed by men who had been mariners from birth , had crossed to Brooklyn in the storm ; and when the rain slackened on the night of the twenty-ninth , Washington had marched his whipped regiments out of the fort and down to the boats . The undisciplined , unruly soldiers had trampled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders of their comrades in their eagerness to escape ; yet all of them had been safely dumped into the boats and ferried across to the lower tip of Manhattan Island . The behavior of the rebels in the weeks that followed was bad enough ; but that of Howe was worse.  |p321When  the wind changed and the admiral 's ships were able to uvc up the East River and the North River , and to trap the rebels the lower end of Manhattan Island , Howe would n't move . E is had to make new plans , Stedman told us , and he laughed when said it . " Plans ! " Buell shouted . " What sort of plans does he have to make t are any harder than I 'd have to make if I was going out to rob apple orchard ! Plans be damned ! All he 's got to do is sail his ps up the river and let ' em go ashore ! The minute he does that , I have the rebels boxed up on the tip of the island , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Howe 's army on the fourth ! " hat 's pretty near the truth , " Stedman said. rctty near ! " Buell cried . " Hell , it 's exact ! Any pink-cheeked nant in Howe 's army that ai n't hardly out of diapers yet could how to capture New York and every last rebel ! You do n't even to be a soldier to plan how to do what Howe wants to do ! , damn it , I could plan it myself , and plan it a lot easier than I d figure how to get rid of eight dollars in counterfeit rebel money " know one thing , " I said . " I came here to see the finish of the 1 army , and I 've seen about all I can stand . Howe delayed , de- , delayed , until the summer was almost gone ; then he outwitted battered the rebels till they were ready to surrender to sixteen flaggons and a wooden cannon ; then he sat down and let ' em get I Now he 's doing nothing again at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move . I ca n't sit here any r and watch this fool play into the rebels ' hands . I 've got to do thing that 'll be useful  --  go where everything is n't being botched ungled. " you ca n't go now , " Stedman protested . " You 'd be leaving at the moment when things must change for the better . The next timemoves , the rebels ca n't possibly dodge him . They wo n't be to row away , because of the warships . They wo n't be able to their way through Howe 's army , because they have no guns , no , no generals that know what to do , no army capable of ing instructions . " e heard all that before , " I said . " I used to believe it , but I don'tt it any longer . " el about the way you do , Oliver , " Buell said , " but if I was you , e it one more try . I heard somewhere that the third try never fails , and Howe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . I-h let ' em get away after they were licked at Bunker Hill , and he let ' cm get away after they were licked at Brooklyn ; but it ai n't possible he 'll let ' em get away again ! He 's a bastard in more ways than one , Oliver ; but he ca n't be all bastard . " He looked at me owlishly . " Ai n't it strange , Oliver , that nobody 's given the general a title for what he 's done over here ? I could think up some good ones for him . " After the manner of all men in all wars , we laughed immoderately at some of the names Buell thought up for Howe ; and we even helped him with such whimsical masterpieces as Lord Snore of Neverup ; Lord Howe of When ; William Howe , Duke of Dally ; Lord Lingerloring .. . We did n't know the half of it ! Against my better judgment , I waited for Howe to move once more , and the waiting was a nightmare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while summer waned and winter 's inactivity came closer , the whole army camped on the tip of Long Island , looking across to New York . In addition to the agony of waiting , the prisoners supposedly in my care were hungry and mistreated , and I could do nothing about it . For two days after the battle all the prisoners were crowded into a small farmhouse in Bedford and kept closely confined , though I was unable to learn why , other than that Cunningham desired itsCunningham took perverse delight in making the captured rebels miserable mentally as well as physically . If the dimensions of a room for prisoners were twelve by twenty feet , he quartered fifty in it . Into such a room forty men can wedge themselves at night , provided they lie tight against each other , and roll over together on a given signal Fifty , however , are too many ; but Cunningham took visible pleasur in seeing fifty trying to live in such a room . Somewhere he had picked up , as servant , pet and confidant , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geniall explained  --  that celebrated Negro , Scipio Africanus . Stedman and were at a loss to know whether Sip 's sense of humor was so a normally developed that everything seemed humorous to him , o whether , like Cunningham 's , it was merely warped . No matter wha Cunningham did or said , Sip was quick with shrill laughter  --  unles warned by Cunningham to be silent . P323Cunningham visited the prisoners only when he 'd been drinking . us he usually came to see them at hours when Stedman and I were work on other things . When we wished to find him in order to erect the abuses for which he was responsible , nobody ever seemed know where he was. he second day after the battle I rose early and went to the prison se to make sure the doors and windows were opened as soon as possible ; and while I stood there , trying to close my ears to the curses recriminations of the prisoners , Cunningham strode into the yard , owed by Sip . He was steady enough on his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they might at any moment slip and slide to any part his face . His eyes were red , as though the wine he had consumedflooded into them . Evidently he had made a night of it and ! led he had n't . Who opened those windows ? " he asked . He passed his hand over mouth , stared hard at his palm ; then focused his eyes on me . " Oh , you , Wiswell ! Do n't you know these rebel scoundrels ? Cowards ! you in the back ! Have those windows closed ! " he prisoners heard him all too easily ; a shout of protest and hatred c from them . Cunningham gave me a patronizing look . " Hear that ? Close the dews , Wiswell , and nail ' em shut ! " aptain , " I said , " there 's too many prisoners in those rooms . I had windows opened . The prisoners 'll die if you nail the windowst ' em , " Cunningham said . " Damned small loss to the world if every damned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " Each prisoner , if alive , can be hanged for one of your own army . Also we 're responsible for prisoners , just as a parent is responsible for a child , even though the is n't all it ought to be . " h , come now ! " Cunningham cried . " D' you mean to say we 're risible for rebels ? Most emphatically not , Wiswell ! They forced selves on us , did n't they ? Certainly they did , because they were cared to run away ! We 're not responsible for ' em any more'nbe responsible for thieves that broke into your house ! " He Id to the huge Negro . " Sip , where 's that rope ? " K colored man drew a coil of hemp from beneath his raggedningham took it and studied the noose at its end . " Splendid324 OLIVER WISWELLP324bit of hemp , " he said . " Flexible but strong ! Chokes nicely without unduly shocking . It 's had a deal of use , I 'd say . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lan ' sake , Cap'n , " Sip said , " I lost count ! " " I feared so , " Cunningham said . " Ah well : no harm done , but don make mistakes like that when you start hanging ' em in this house ! " Sip laughed understandingly . " Sir , " I said , " I do n't think these men should be smothered a night , starved during the day , or frightened by empty threats at an time . " Cunningham moistened his lips , and his smile seemed to undula upon his lower face . I might have thought of that smile , once , genial . I knew better now . " Empty threats , eh ? " Cunningham asked . " You Americans shout get about a bit , to learn what 's happening ! Why , my young frier there 's scarcely a house in New York that has n't been pillaged h these miserable rebels . They 're soldiers , and under military disciplin yet they pillage their own people ! Damn it , sir , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em lashed to ribbo every day for thievery and worse ! Oh yes ; worse ! Damn it , Wiswe hanging 's kinder treatment than they ought to get ! " From one of the windows of the jail came a gay and mocking voi  --  that of Soame Leighton . " The captain 's an authority on thieve Mr. Wiswell . He steals our rations , and replaces ' em with maggo and weevils packed in stinking meat and rotten bread . " A roar that was part applause and part hatred came from t jail windows . I heard the words , " Irish slave-driver ! " " Foo snatcher ! " " Thief ! " " Murderer ! " Cunningham went suddenly crimson and , all in a moment 's tim sickeningly white . He slowly turned his head to look at me , and h eye sockets had a sooty look against his parchmentlike skin . Y he continued to smile , even then . " Seem to know your name , Wi well ! " He went closer to the prison house , his sooty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And are the maggots to your tas gentlemen , " he asked , " or are they smaller than those you 're a customed to in your cozy homes ? " Soame Leighton 's mocking voice sounded clear above the hooti of the other prisoners : " We do n't like ' em , Cunningham ! They 're t gamy ! They must have been brought up inside Englishmen aP325rishmen that have n't opened their heads to a new idea since 1692 ! " Cunningham turned to me . " Call the guard , Mr. Wiswell . " " Captain , " I said , " they 've had bad treatment since the battle . They ) n't " Call the guard ! " he shouted . " Ca n't you hear me tell you to call c guard ? Ca n't you God-damned Americans do one damned thing u 're told ? Call that guard , or by God you 'll regret it ! " " Sir , " I said , " that prisoner " " You 'll call the guard , Wiswell , " Cunningham whispered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I recognized him . You want to make a pet of him , do n't you ? I suppose you think pets ays escape , eh ? Well , this pet wo n't ! Call the guard , Wiswell , ore I lose my temper . " called the guard . A corporal , followed by six men , marched ough the gate and to where we stood . The corporal saluted. unningham beamed at the corporal in a manner I can only describe as fatherly . " We 're moving a prisoner or two . What are you loaded with ? " Ball , " the corporal said. unningham looked dubious . " It 's not enough , boys . Load with kshot . " Shall we draw the ball ? " the corporal asked o indeed , " Cunningham said . " Leave the ball and put six buck-s on top of it . " He smiled up at the windows of the jail . Those lows were silent now  --  so silent that the dry rattling of the buckrollingdown the barrels was loud in our ears. he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in aunningham looked pleased . " Take positions on either side of the doorway , " he said . " If there 's any demonstration , shoot at their achs . " He winked at me and strode to the jail door , which sentry unlocked with a huge key fastened about his waist with in. hatever they say of Cunningham , he had the courage of the 1-perhaps because something was missing in his brain . He walked right into the jail and stood inside the hall , and the corporal 's , closing in behind him , stood and knelt on either side of theay , their muskets leveled. ow then , " we heard Cunningham shout , " there 's been some talk this morning about bad food , and too many prisoners being confined in these quarters , and similar complaints . Mr. Leighton , will you step forward , please ? " Evidently Soame Leighton strode out from among his fellow prisoners ; for Cunningham went on : " So you do n't find the food to your taste , Mr. Leighton ? " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There 's none of us here that 'd recognize it as food if it was n't served to us at meal-times . " Cunningham spoke almost regretfully . " I 'm sorry indeed to hear it , Mr. Leighton ! We 've been busy the last few days , as you can well understand , and we ca n't inspect every mouthful of food the navy brings us . " " If the navy brought that food , " Soame said , " that 's probably the reason your ships did n't sail up to help the general . Probably the sailors were sick from the smell of it . " " Ah , " Cunningham said , " but we were fighting rebels , who can be beat with no ships and only half an army ! Any other complaints , Mr. Leighton ? " " Since you bring the matter up , " Soame said , " we have . We 'd like a chance to put our case before someone who has a faint conception of justice and mercy . " " Justice and mercy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been disloyal to their government should n't ask too loudly fo justice ! As for mercy , your people showed mighty little to their ow countrymen in the Long Island swamps ! But there , there , Mr. Leigh ton ; you 're a prisoner and I 'm not , and it ill befits me to remind yo of the many shortcomings of your fellow rebels . It 's enough for to to know you 're not satisfied . Since you do n't appreciate this shelte we 've provided for you , I 'm going to take you out of it and send yo to Gravesend , where there 's more air and light , and where the foo is fresh from the ships . " He turned to the corporal . " Corporal , send two of your men t Gravesend with Mr. Leighton . He 's to speak with no one on the wa  --  no one ! I fear Mr. Leighton 's ideas of justice are n't quite wha they ought to be , and if he talks with anyone , he might misrepresent , The corporal spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knee went into the jail , and came out with Soame Leighton between the In the early-morning light he looked ghastly , but he cocked his cy at me in that humorous way of his . When I took a step towards him , Cunningham spoke to me pcp327emptorily . " Mr. Wiswell , I need you and Mr. Stedman . You made a complaint about the overcrowding of these prisoners , and I 'm going leave it to you to put an end to it . " I looked helplessly after Soame as he went marching off between c two guards toward the wooded slopes that lay between us and Gravesend . In spite of his tattered breeches , his unshaved face and ( combed hair , his sweat-stained shirt , his wretched stockings , hisken shoes , there was something debonair and defiant about him ul . Mr. Wiswell , " Cunningham said again , and his voice was peremptory . I went to the door of the jail . " Now then , " Cunningham said , " I want you and Mr. Stedman to Cort all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All ht . I 've just the house for ' em in Flatbush  --  just the house . You'llit in the middle of the Hessian camp . " The look he turned on was triumphant . " You can start moving ' em this very minute , . Wiswell . They 'll not only be more comfortable in Flatbush , t there 'll be less opportunity for ' em to stab us in the back . " lc turned on his heel , beckoned to his black servant and abruptlyus . As he went I heard him laughing , and the sound was like passage of a saw through ice.  |p328The  transfer of the prisoners through the middle pass to Flatbush was a nightmare that so completely filled the next few days that I half forgot Soame Leighton . Our prisoners would have tried the patience of saints . They hated Buell , Stedman and me with unrelenting bitterness , blaming us for all the evils suffered at Cunningham 's hands . Encouraged by the almost miraculous escape of the army that everyone had regarded as lost , they made life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while we marched them across the wooded heights and down into the plains of Flatbush , but while we were trying to make their new quarters livable , and doing our best to locate for them the rationsthat Cunningham should have sent us but did n't . The house to which Cunningham had ordered us was a farmhous belonging to a celebrated rebel named Lefferts . This part of Long Island boasted as many Leffertses to the square mile as Boston did Adamses ; but whereas all the Adamses were rebels , most of th Leffertses were Loyalists , so that a Lefferts who was a rebel wa truly noteworthy . I knew Cunningham must have chosen the Lefferts house for the prisoners because he wanted them to be tormented by the Hessians ; and since I 'd heard dreadful rumors of their cruelty to rebels , I fears the worst as we led our long line of unarmed , unshaven , half-cla prisoners between the tents that filled the fields on either side of th road . The Hessians called gutturally to each other as we drew near , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't like their looks , ap329though there seemed to be nothing cruel about them . They looked heavy , slow-witted ; their eyes were pale and cold . Yet they did n't look like men who would give no quarter , brutally pin defeated rebels to trees with their bayonets , or hack defenseless enemies with sabers for the mere fun of killing . Still , that 's how the Hessians had chaved , according to what we 'd heard from the rebels ; and II three of us heaved a sigh of relief when we had herded the risoners safely into the Lefferts house , even though it was mailer than the one they 'd occupied in Bedford , and in worse condition . The furniture , what there was of it , was smashed , doors were half IT their hinges , windows broken , floors littered with broken crockery , Token bottles and all sorts of trash . The prisoners grumbled at their filthy quarters ; and Buell sided it ! ' them . " Hessians did this ! " he cried . " What in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help him ? Look at the mess cy 've made ! By God , if Cunningham had the decency of a catfish , ' c1 bring every Hessian into this house and make ' em clean the floors with their tongues ! " He was interrupted by a shout from the yard without . When went to the door , I saw a pink-cheeked young Hessian officer , his s as blue as a china teacup , and his back so straight that he med about to topple backwards . At sight of me he spoke guttur- , as if in protest against everyone and everything . " What 's his trouble ? " I asked Stedman . " Nothing , " Stedman said . " He says the rebels occupied this house fore the battle  --  kept sharpshooters in it and made raids from it at ht . He says that as soon as the rebels were driven out , a guardstationed around the house so no further harm would be done. men cleaned up the grounds and made ' em look decent , buthouse is just as the rebels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't responsible for the damage . " the young officer saluted , turned sharply on his heel and marched provisions had been issued to the prisoners before we marched , were there any at the Lefferts house when we arrived ; so StedandI scoured all of Flatbush for the provision wagon that I was Cunningham must have sent us . When we returned at dusk , ty-handed , the space between the road and the sentry fires outside Lefferts house was packed with blue-coated Hessian soldiers ,  | hundreds of them , all staring at the house as children stare : tt dangerous animals in a cage . The sentries , pacing up and down behind the fires , shot uneasy glances over their shoulders at the rows of faces ; and the prisoners , massed at the windows , were silent for the first time since they 'd been imprisoned . The sergeant in charge of the guard affected indifference whe I questioned him about the Hessians . " They started coming her around sundown in twos and threes , ' " he said .. " They ai n't done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Have they made any threats ? " " They ai n't done a damned thing , " the sergeant repeated , " excep hang their jaws down so far a catbird could nest in their mouth and stare up at those prisoners . " He looked quickly over his ow shoulder at the long ' pallid row of faces glimmering in the firelight and added irascibly , " They ought to be taught some manners ! Then ai n't anything so irritating as having a lot of people stare at you ! " " What did they want ? " Stedman asked . " I ca n't talk their lingo , " the sergeant said . " Besides , they got mad with all their staring . If they got anything to say , they ought t step up like honest men and ask permission to say it . " " They 're pretty shy , " Stedman said . " They 're a lot like cows . think we ought to find out what they want . " He went straight to the throng of Hessians and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them gave him a muttered answer . Stedman caught one of the blue-clad arms and held it up for m to see . In the man 's hand was an apple . Stedman caught at two others . One held a hard biscuit , the other an apple . " They want to feed the prisoners , " Stedman said . " They want t go close up to the windows , so to see ' em better . They want to giv ' em the food with their own hands . " We herded the Hessians into a double line that shuffled past th Lefferts house for two hours . Every man in that line had something that he freely gave . I marveled that men so miserably paid as th Hessians could bring themselves to part with possessions that mu have seemed so important to them . I marveled , too , at the tin scraps of food they had considered worth saving . Soup bones , the half of a sausage , potatoes , a chicken wing , a calp331not , the quarter of a cabbage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Were the offerings that blue-clad arm after blue-clad arm held up toward the rebels that crowded the lower windows of the Lefferts louse ; and from those open windows came reluctant laughter and rumbling thanks . Buell went back to the camp from which we 'd started our march ross the hills to the battle of Brooklyn , got his four geese , his print-g press and the rest of our belongings , and sacrificed his feathered lends to make soup for the prisoners . He was bitter over the necessity of killing his pets to feed rebels , but he put the blame where belonged  --  on Cunningham . " I ai n't going to forget this , Oliver , " he id . " Some day I 'll get back at Cunningham for making me kill Old pt , and I 'll never overlook a chance to make his name a byword . I'llto fix it so that every man who writes on the wall of a privy will rite Cunningham 's name before he writes anything else ! " God only knows to how many requisitions Buell forged Cunningham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ask where he got the dried peas , turnips , the beans and the salt pork that he brought back . All I c w was that he did n't bring enough. he Hessians visited us daily with all the food they could spare , they were n't too well treated themselves ; and when they 'd en the edge off their own hunger , they had n't much to give ay. my occasionally were we able to get army rations for our charges ; all our protests to Cunningham were unavailing . His assistants us repeatedly and with every appearance of truthfulness that thehad been ordered for us  --  had been sent , even  --  but must have n waylaid by hungry enemies before it reached us. n the second of September I started my hunt for Soame Leighamongthe vessels and hulks that had been anchored in Gravesendto serve as prisons for captured sailors and for such soldier Deers as could n't be accommodated on land. lot until the thirteenth , however , did I find him , and even then I found out where he was ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tad visited the Cantwell hulk , the Vigilant hulk , the Singaporeand the Eagle hulk without success ; but when my boatman me under the quarter-deck of the Canterbury hulk , which was nothing more than a brig whose best days had been spent in carryingrum from the West Indies , my luck changed . The vessel was commanded , as were most of the hulks , by a grayhairedlieutenant  --  one of those unfortunates without influence or money , who would remain a lieutenant until he died of fever in some African or West Indian port . Perhaps his trouble was overamiability ; for when I shouted up to him that I was on the staff of the commissary general and hunting Soame Leighton , a rebel captain , he looked genuinely concerned . " What was his particular sin that he should have been given the Black Hole ? " " The Black Hole ! " I said . " I think there must be some mistake . With your permission , sir , I 'll come aboard and speak with Mr. Leighton . " The lieutenant looked even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one 's to speak to any prisoner who 's given the Black Hole . He had n't the look of a desperate character when he came aboard ; but he must have been ! Black Hole for the duration of the war !

" Certainly , " the lieutenant said , " but there 's no way I can let you see Mr. Leighton . I 'm sorry  --  I 'm very sorry indeed ; for he looked to be a decent young man if ever I saw one . " I was sick when I had a nearer view of the Canterbury , for it tol me what Soame must be enduring . She was small and battered , an she stank of bilge and rotten wood , bad food and sickness ; even th few marines and officers on her decks made her look crowded ; an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interior must b purely horrible ; her Black Hole a hell unspeakable . " Sir , " I said to the lieutenant , " I 'm sure you 'd never be a part to unnecessary cruelty . Unless I 'm greatly mistaken , that 's wha this is . Wo n't you let me have five minutes with Mr. Leighton ? " " Unnecessary cruelty ? " the lieutenant repeated . " On whose par may I ask ? " " Well , sir , " I said , " you do n't know me and I may be making great mistake , but the responsible person is Captain Cunningham . The lieutenant eyed me doubtfully . " You 're saying , I take it , tha Captain Cunningham is closing his eyes to the misbehavior of a su ordinate . "  | " No , sir , " I said , " I 'm saying that Captain Cunningham is responsible . I 'd prefer to say no more , but I give you my word of honor that your prisoner is guilty of no crime except that of irritatingCaptain Cunningham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few minutes , sir ? " The lieutenant stared hard at me . " A few minutes ? What good ould a few minutes do ? You 'd only sympathize with the prisoner , nd he 'd be more discontented with his lot . But that 's neither here nor here , Mr. Wiswell . Orders are orders , and my orders are that when man 's sent to the Black Hole , no person shall hold communication ith him . " " But if a prisoner 's being unjustly treated " Have no fear , Mr. Wiswell , " the lieutenant said . " I 'll look into that . ' II make inquiries at once . " " If you find I 'm right , " I said , " I assume you 'd have no objec-tions  --  " " Objections ! " the lieutenant cried . " If Leighton 's been unfairly cated , you can spend all your days with him so far as I 'm conrned ! Come back here tomorrow , Mr. Wiswell . We 'll have a glass f wine together , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face , when I mounted the gangplank of the anterbury on the following afternoon , told me without any words from him that Cunningham had been too much for us . He was angry , rmd he was regretful , too , and he voiced his thoughts as strongly as an i and timid naval lieutenant was able . " Devilish unfortunate ! If d suspected this , you 'd have seen Leighton yesterday , orders or no tiers ! " He put his hands beneath his coat tails and flapped them angrily . " I might have known it , " I said . " I believe there 's no limit to what Cunningham will do when he hates someone . " " Oh , you 're quite wrong , Mr. Wiswell , " the lieutenant said . " Nobodycould have been kinder than Captain Cunningham . He had thing to do with moving Leighton from this vessel . Indeed , I 've seen a kinder man than Captain Cunningham . " I thought back to the days when I had first seen Cunningham calling affable greetings at us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd thought him kind then , too ; and surely I did n't blame a man who was still a lieutenant at the age of fifty he too had failed to see beneath Cunningham 's warm smile.  |p334Maynard  looked defiant . " I know what you 're thinking , " he said , " but I assure you you 're wrong . I went in person to see Captain Cunningham . At first , when I mentioned Leighton 's name , he did n't recall him . " " Nonsense , " I said . " No , no , " Maynard said . " Not nonsense at all ! You 're prejudiced ! He really looked quite blank at my mention of the name . He did n't remember Leighton till I reminded him that Leighton had been put in the Black Hole for the duration of the war . Then , all in a flash , it came back to him . Leighton had been guilty of insubordination and at inciting to riot  --  really a most serious charge in a rebel prisoner , my dear Mr. Wiswell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unjust treatment , " I said , " However , let that pass . Did Captain Cunningham know I 'd come here to see Leighton ? " " Oh yes , " Maynard said . " I told him at once that I saw no reason why you should n't be allowed to say a few words to Leighton if you wished . " He shot a quick glance at me . " You 'd assured me your desire to see him was prompted by nothing but personal friendship . " " Personal friendship only , " I said . " Mr. Leighton has been my close friend and neighbor for many years . I know his brothers well . His father and mother were true friends of my own father . I know his sister . I 've got to do everything in my power to make sure Soame Leighton is fairly treated . " " I see , " Maynard said . " I think I see something , too , " I said . " I think perhaps Captain Cunningham gave you to understand that I was somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him would be somehow dangerous . " " He did n't exactly say so , " Maynard admitted , " but I rather go that idea from the tone of his voice . " " Then it was Cunningham who had Soame moved from this ship , ' I said . " But he gave no orders , " Maynard protested . " He said nothing t me about having him moved . The orders came from headquarters A sergeant brought them . We delivered Leighton to him for transfer . ' " Do you have a copy of those orders ? " " They were verbal orders . " " What was the sergeant 's regiment ? " Maynard looked unhappy . " Mr. Wiswell , a prison ship is somp335thing new for me and for all my men . In the future I 'll accept noprisoners without orders , and release none without orders . " I had a gone feeling inside . " Yes , " I said , " I understand . I suppose you have no way of knowing where the sergeant took Leighton ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . I 'm sorry , but I have no idea . " When I turned from him he put his hand upon my arm . " Won'tyou join me in a glass of wine , Mr. Wiswell ? " " No , " I said . " Do n't think I 'm not grateful , but I 've got to get to headquarters without loss of time . "  |p336LEVER  got to headquarters . When I hurried back to our tent to shave and dress , Stedman and Buell were waiting for me . " Just in time , " Buell said . " You 'd better stay on duty if you do n't want to spend the rest of your life on a prison ship yourself . " " I 've laid out your things , " Stedman said . " Loring wants us to go into New York . " " Into New York ? " I said . " I 'm not going into New York . Cunninghamfound out that I knew where Soame Leighton was , and he 's moved him . " " Where to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " There 's no record of who took him or where he was taken . I do n't like it , and I 'm going to headquarters to try and find out about it . " " You ca n't do that , " Stedman said . " We 're under orders . We 're ordered into New York at once , and we ca n't go by day . If we do , the rebels 'll capture us . We 've got to go tonight , and that means we 've got to go now . " " You do n't understand , " I said . " Cunningham 's doing everything in his power to destroy Soame Leighton , and I 've got to do what I can to stop it . " Buell took a firm grip on my coat lapel . " Do n't do anything rash , Oliver . Orders are orders , and ai n't to be disobeyed , even when they 're senseless . You 're worried about Soame Leighton ; but I 'd be more worried about you if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soame Leighton . Maybe I 'll have better luck than you would , becauseCunningham wo n't be watching me the way he would you . "  |p337He  broke off to stare at me glassily , and into his eyes came a farawaylook . " Cunningham ! " he whispered . " You say Cunningham found out you 'd learned where Soame was . Now I wonder  --  " " By God , Tom , " I cried , " I believe you 're right ! When did these orders reach you  --  these orders for Stedman and me to go to New York ? " Stedman answered for him . " An hour and a half ago . " " Then Tom is right , " I said . " It was an hour and a half ago that boame Leighton was removed from the Canterbury prison ship on unwritten orders from headquarters . " " Now wait , Oliver , " Buell said . " It 's a coincidence . Anyway , you 've got your orders , and you 've got to obey ' em . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other duty , ca n't I ? I 've got to help Soame Leighton , have n't I ? " " You ca n't do anything for him that I ca n't do , " Buell said . " Do n't you do one damned thing to give Cunningham a hold on you ! Obey your orders ! " I stared hard at Buell . He meant what he said . He was afraid of Cunningham ; and that very fear of his would , I knew , bring all his ingenuity to the fore . " I have n't even seen the orders , " I said . " What are they ? " Stedman took a paper from his breast pocket . " We 're to cross over u New York and make a report on warehouses , churches and public uildings that will hold all our supplies and ten thousand prisoners . en thousand prisoners means that Howe expects to capture nearly e whole rebel army . " " I do n't like it , " I said . " New York 's full of Loyalists . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the city d knows more about it than we do ? " Buell was patient with me . " You 've been around an army long ough to know generals ca n't do anything as easy as that . They t to have somebody to blame in case something goes wrong . " 1 wondered what Buell knew that I did n't . Clearly he knew someng . " I noticed one little thing about those orders , " Buell said , " that ybe I was n't supposed to notice . " He took the paper from Sted- . " Listen to this : You 're told what churches and what sugar ses to examine , and you 're also told to go to Bushwick for a t , and what boatman to hire , and where to land in New York , d what tavern to go to . How do you like that , Oliver ? "   " I do n't like it , " I said . " I do n't like it any better than I like the rest of the order . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " You know very well why , " I said . " The boatman might be a friend of Cunningham 's . If we stay where we 're told , the rebels might just possibly learn , in some mysterious way , where we 're staying , and the tavern might burn down with us in it . " Buell looked relieved . " You 're getting smarter every day , Oliver . Do n't go near Bushwick ; and when you get to New York , stay with somebody you can trust  --  somebody who can protect you from rebels , and get word to me if you need anything . " " How 'll I find such a paragon ? " I asked . " March up and down Broadway , shouting for someone who hates rebels ? " " I 'm a printer , Oliver , " Buell said . " Printers travel all over this country , sure of being helped wherever they go , provided there 's a printer there . As far as getting help 's concerned , I 'd rather be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the printer that talked me into going to Dedham to print those broadsides that got me my coat of tar and feathers . " " What 's his name ? " I asked . " Serle , " Buell said . " Ambrose Serle . At the sign of the Bible and Crown in Hanover Square . " Our boatman put us ashore , late that same night , on the western side of the island near Coenties Slip . Late as it was , the streets were crowded , and we found ourselves wholly unremarked . Boston , as I had known it , was only a country town compared to New York , which was an overwhelming jumble of brick buildings , blacksmith shops , taverns , sugar houses , mansions , distilleries , churches , ship chandleries , clothing stores , jewelers , liquor dealers , goldsmiths , furriers , elegant homes and God knows what-all . The thing that struck me most about this strange city was the strange foreign names above the shop doors  --  Duyckinck , Bywanck , Van Dam , Brinckerhoff , Dyckman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Square , but there were no light at the address Buell had given us , so we rightly deduced that it wa Serle 's place of business and not his home . We slept that night in the Province Arms on Broadway , repr senting ourselves to be shipbuilders from Massachusetts ; and i the morning we went again to Hanover Square where , unwillingP339ask questions that would show us to be strangers , we strolled around the town until the bars were removed from the door and windowsof Serle 's establishment. pStedman and I were fascinated by the behavior of the people who passed through Hanover Square on their way to business . Every last one of them seemed to be in a hurry ; most of them were shoutingat each other : shouting about business . Their voices were harsher sod louder than any I 'd ever heard in Boston . They waved their hands in each other 's faces , and seemed bent on outshoving each other . Many were Irish , and Stedman pointed out many othersat he said were Jews  --  the first I 'd ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair , were rebel soldiers , recognizable as soldiers because they carried muskets , powder horns nd cartridge boxes . Apart from their accouterments , they looked ikc the sweepings of gutters and farms . They were shambling , angling , shifty-eyed , slovenly and , for the most part , pock-marked. scarcely one of them , obviously , took pride in his personal appearnee . Early as it was , many of these militiamen were already drunk , nd went bellowing along the street , guffawing with the peculiar emptiness of brainless men . Merchants hurrying to their work walked wide around the brawling ilitiamen , as they might have walked around a hog wallow ; and c glances turned upon those sorry soldiers were worse than contemptuous . Not until we got in to see Serle , however , did we hear c thoughts that must have been in the heads of all those New orkers who had walked so warily around their defenders . Serle was a pudgy man with a rosy face and blue eyes that stared pressionlessly at us through eight-sided spectacles . " Tom Buell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I wondered what had become of cll . I 'm surprised he 's alive . He must have learned to control his ague . I always told him he had nothing to fear if he 'd only pre-d to be dumb . Here in New York we 've learned to talk politics little as possible , and endure the rebels as best we can . If we did otherwise , there 'd be scarcely a shop or a place of business open inentire city . Anyone with any property would have been drivenlong ago . Well , thank God we wo n't have to endure ' em muchcr . Thanks to their pigheadedness , General Howe can take the citythe whole rebel army as soon as he makes up his mind to do it . " c looked at me speculatively . " How do you account for the general 's slowness , Mr. Wiswell ? Why does n't he attack ? Almost every printing press outside of New England is in this city , but we ca n't use ' em to get our case before the people until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country is pouring out lies at top speed , and we ca n't do anything about it . What 's the matter with Howe ? " " I do n't know , Mr. Serle , " I said . " His own officers ask the same question , but there 's no satisfactory answer . " Serle , his pudgy hands folded across his hard , round stomach , eyed us moodily . " Somebody 'd better find an answer to it , or these damned rascals of Washington 's wo n't let us live , much less carry on our trades . They 're more like animals than men . A woman is n't safe on the street with these militiamen running loose . They steal , burn , rape , kill ; and we ca n't lift a hand to protect ourselves ! And now you and Mr. Stedman have been sent over here to hunt for our nicest jails and storehouses ! That sounds to me as though General Howe expected the war to continue for some little time to come . What 's he trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the most senseless , uneducated , intolerant good-for-nothings in the colonies ? " " Buell thinks your troubles 'll be over in a week , " I said . " Howe 's a good general , and his men all say the rebels have n't a chance against him . " Serle 's reply was irascible . " If he 's so good , why in God 's name does n't he finish what he sets out to do ? Good God , Mr. Wiswell , you would n't let the best barber in the world cut your hair if he left it half cut , would you ? " When Stedman and I were silent , Serle jumped from his chair , went to the paneled wall of the room in which we sat , and snapped a catch . The panels broke into small doors , and beyond them we saw the shining wheels and levers of a printing press . " Look at that ! " Serle said . " That 's the finest press in New York , and it 's got to stand idle when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two whole years , instead of running day and night to tell the people of this country all the silly reasons that are pushing us into war ; to tell ' em who the lying politicians are that are keeping us there ; to tell ' cm how they 're being ruined by a Congress that knows less about government than my cat ; to tell ' em their chuckleheaded generals lack the ability to make a platoon of infantry order arms ; to tell ' cm their militia regiments run like rabbits whenever a gun goes off ; to publish the facts about the thousands of decent Americans who 've been mobbed and manhandled because they dared to stand up for what they knew to be right ... " P311Stedman interrupted him . " Mr. Serle , Mr. Wiswell and I are Americansand need help . Both of us were driven from our homes by the rebels . My father was a justice of the supreme court of Pennsylvania . He was driven to England . Mr. Wiswell 's had to go to Halifax with Howe . He died on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed a shaking hand across his forehead . " Of course , " he said . " You 'll have to pardon my irritability . We find this waiting very disturbing . Now let me see : your commissary wants quarters for ten thousand prisoners , does he ? Well , if I were you I 'd look first at such buildings as King 's College , the Brick Church , the North Dutch Church , the Scotch Church on Cedar Street , and the Friends ' Meeting House on Liberty Street . And of course you must n't overlook the sugar houses . They 're the biggest , and I 'd say they were the best , for your purposes  --  Van Cortlandt 's , Rhinelander 's and the Liberty Street Sugar House . You 'd better start on Liberty Street . You can get damned near the whole American army in that Sugar House . " It was at the Liberty Street Sugar House that the rebels tried to catch us . Probably I could n't have proved in a court of law that Cunningamhad lodged information about us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cunningham did it . He hated me , and he hated Stedman ; and as I shall show , there was no limit to Cunningham 's Cruelty toward those he disliked . The rebels had found out that there would be two of us looking t sugar houses ; they had been told how we were dressed ; how we Joked ; they had been instructed that of the two of us , I was the tie whose capture was most essential  --  and from whom could they ave got that information , if not from Cunningham ? Even now I can hear their voices bawling within a foot of my hiding place . " The other one , " they called me . I was damned as a rturer of prisoners ; as a " murdering Tory " . Ah yes : their informa-n came straight from Cunningham ! I never saw a gloomier building than the Liberty Street Sugar douse . Its stone walls were a dirty gray , and the windows in all of r five stories were small and deep-set , with something of the look f @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arched door large enough for a wagon loaded with sugar hogsheads to pass through it ; and a high stockade of closely fitted hewn timbers enclosedevery portion of this gaunt structure except the entrance . We halted on the opposite side of the street and did our best to estimate the floor space of that unprepossessing place . There was a surprising amount of activity around it . The heads of two horses protruded from the entrance , and we knew that behind them a wagon was being loaded with sugar barrels . On either side of the arch stood an attendant , and in the street a dozen idlers watched the motionless horses with the vacant stares peculiar to city folk when they view the activities of others . " Those walls are three feet thick , " Stedman said , " and that ' building must be sixty by eighty . I 'd say that ought to take care of fifty prisoners on each floor if they were n't overcrowded . That 's a window for every three and a half men . In hot weather almost every prisoner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " They 'll sleep on the floor , " I reminded him . " What do you suppose the floors are made of ? How many partitions on each floor ? " " We 've got to find out , " Stedman said . " I 'll find out about this place and you go on to the Friends ' Meeting House . " " We 'd better go together , " I said . " Nonsense , " Stedman said . " We 've got thirty places to see , and the sooner we do it , the sooner we can get away . I do n't like the feel of the city or the looks of the people . You wait at the Meeting House for me , and I 'll come there as soon as I look inside this cave . " I could see he was on edge , and I knew I was . I did n't like what we were doing , not only because I considered it unnecessary , but because I had a peculiar prickly feeling behind my ears , as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste time , " I told him , " and do n't put anything down on paper . " I left Stedman and set off for the Friends ' Meeting House . Its stumpy , brick spire was a hundred yards away ; and as I approached it , I looked back at the idlers who stood before the Sugar House . Three of them had turned to look after me . In their faces I saw doubt and indecision , but no vacancy . I stopped and faced them . As I did so , two more idlers turned to look at Stedman . Five of them were looking at him : looking from him to me and back to him again . I tried to have orderly thoughts about those five staring faces , but343a sort of numbness prevented me from thinking about anything . I ound myself repeating again and again " Friends ' Meeting House : riends ' Meeting House "  --  found myself , too , quickening my steps to each the shelter of that squat brick spire  --  hurrying with tensed muscles ; with ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all too soon , and from Stedman . He was shouting , d of course his shouts were intended for me . " There 's some miske ! " he cried . " There 's some mistake ! " I shot a quick glance over my shoulder . Stedman , his arms wildly dailing , was the center of a group of those who a moment before d been seemingly idle onlookers before the Sugar House . The other If-dozen of those onlookers were running toward me as fast as they would run , their faces no longer even doubtful , but angry and demined . Stedman 's case , I saw , was hopeless ; and I feared that my own s nearly so . I ran as I had never run before ; and as I ran I looked sperately about me for a sanctuary . From my pursuers then came uts of " Spy ! Spy ! " On my left was a narrow , curving street walled with narrow ick houses . I bolted into it and immediately turned again to dart to a passageway between two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I n't know . All I wanted to do was to keep clear of those six men behind me  --  those six men who were bound to be just such men as se who tarred and feathered Tom Buell ; as those who slashed outtongue of the mare so unfortunate as to belong to a man who posed them politically ; as those who drove the Loyalists of Long ml into the swamps ; as those who had destroyed government , and order in every province of America. he alley , to my consternation , came to an abrupt end between ht-foot brick walls , above the tops of which rose the tips of weedy thorns . In each wall was a green gate . I tried the one on my . It was locked . I turned desperately to the one on my right . It , was locked . When I threw my weight against it , it seemed as d as the brick wall itself. the street at the mouth of the alley , a dozen voices bawled , y ! Spy ! " esperation gave me an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , ht the coping of the wall , felt a finger gashed to the bone by en glass , swung myself somehow to the top and somehow d across a coping studded with jagged fragments of bottles . With a crashing that to me seemed thunderous , I tumbled into thorny branches , and broke through them to the ground . The shouts of , " Spy ! Spy ! " were loud in the alley . On hands and knees I crawled out from the hawthorns . Blood was running from a dozen cuts in my hands ; my coat , waistcoat and breeches were slashed as by knives . I was in a small yard with no outlets save the gate I had vainly tried to open , and a green door at the rear of the house . With shouts of , " Spy ! Spy ! Spy ! Spy ! " echoing in my ears , I had no choice . I ran up the steps to the green door and wrenched at the latch with bloody fingers . The door moved spongily , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Spy ! " the voices shouted . The loudest voice bellowed , " Over both walls ! Climb ' em both ! He 's behind one of ' em ! " Heaven only knows from what source a man draws strength in th-e hour of dire need . All I know is that when I heard that harsh voice - ordering men to scale the wall over which I had just climbed , pushed back the door as easily as I 'd open a cupboard in my own home and fell in a heap at the feet of the four persons who had trice to hold it shut.  |p345WHEN  I got to my feet , I looked into the horrified faces an enormously fat Negro woman and two plump ladies who were t , as we say in Milton , as young as they had once been . Beside cm was a frail , pale young man , strikingly similar to the two ladies , cept that he was concave where they were convex . The hallway smelled faintly of old upholstery , dried rose leaves Id burnt cloves ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The young man caught my wrist and turned my hand to look at c palm . " Euphrosyne , " he said , " get a damp cloth . When I go out , ripe off the door handle on the outside . It 'll be bloody . Wipe the carpet , too . " The black woman lumbered from the hallway , and almost immediatelysurged back like a dark storm cloud . To his sisters the young man added , " If they come in , put him in laundry chute . " With that he opened the door through which I had entered and xl in the middle of the small , brick-walled yard , his face a study pure bewilderment and vacuity . The black woman , groaning faintly , quickly at the latch on which my bloody hands had rested. he ladies looked at each other . " Balsam of Peru , " one of them . " I 'll get it , darling . " es , dearest , " the other said , " and clean rags . I 'll take him to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a hand upon my arm . hat 's all this ? " the pale , frail man asked querulously . " Ca n't a write letters in peace without people leaping in and out of his back yard like confounded jumping jacks ? By Gad , sir , I demand an explanation ! Who was that man ? What had he done ? " " Did n't he go in this house ? " an angry voice asked . I knew it owner was staring down into the yard from the top of the brie wall . " This house ! " my host cried . " He most assuredly did not ! He cant - over that wall into the yard and went out over the other wall . Con !  --  he have been a Tory ? " " A murdering Tory spy ! " the voice shouted . " Open the gate an . let us through your yard . " " I will indeed , " I heard my benefactor say . There was the noun . of a bolt being shot . " Come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I heard no more , for the two ladies hurried me to a narrow nigh of stairs and pushed me up them into a room where the distal ) shouts of my pursuers reached me only dimly . Here the two kin . ladies , whom I knew only as " Dearest " and " Darling " , bandaged m hands and shook their heads over the gashes in my clothes . When their brother came in , he fingered the slits in my breeche and waistcoat . " Where else are you hurt besides your hands ? " h asked . " Nowhere , much , " I said . Then , as he seemed content to stand . and watch his sisters rub ointment on me , I added , " What that ma. said was n't true . I 'm not a murderer and I 'm not a spy . " The man raised his eyebrows . " He also called you a Tory . " My narrow escape had made me irritable . " Tory !

I knew as soon as yo jumped over the wall that you were n't a rebel . " He looked me up an . down . " They had a perfect description of you . How 'd that happen ? ' " I 'm not sure , " I said . " Did they mention Stedman  --  the man who was with me  --  the man they caught ? " " Yes , " the man said , " they spoke of him , but it was you the wanted most . They did n't know your name .

" A rebel against intolerance and brutality , justany lawyer , any son of a supreme court judge , would have to I .. " So it 's that Stedman , is it ? " he asked . " Alexander Stedman 's son ! thought the name sounded familiar . My name is Vardill , of the ulty of King 's College . Professor of jurisprudence .

They ca n't him ! " es , they can , " Vardill said . " What 's more , they 'll hang you twice uick ! You 're the one they 're after . If you so much as make an pt to get to Stedman , you 're signing your own death warrant . ' d be as conspicuous with your bandaged hands as a militiaman satin coat .

I was slow and awkward at it , because my hands w swollen and painful .

When the floor did n't fall from under me I groped for the tr door , raised it and listened . The great guns still boomed ; but after the shattering crash I h heard , they sounded harmless . Somewhere outside the house I heard a child crying , dogs ha ing , the sound of running feet . The house itself was silent , for a queer scraping sound , as though a clock 's pendulum , in swinging , dragged briefly against a gritty surface . There was so thing about it that made my knees weak . I felt for the ladder , lowered it through the trap door , and scrambled down to the hallway below . Pictures had fallen from the oval chairs and stair rail were covered with gray dust . I shouted Doctor Vardill 's name ; then listened .

Ambrose Serle was one of the latter . When I pounded on his door , the house was dark : not so much as a pinhead of light showed at any of the windows ; but when , after I 'd been scrutinize and questioned through a peephole and cautiously admitted , I found every room lighted as if for a wedding .

Thanks to the panic of the rebels , I did n't even have to wait th long to find out about Stedman . He pounded on Serle 's door in ha an hour , and I heard his voice impatiently asking , " What happened Wiswell ? " When he came into the room and saw me , he coughed and pr tended he knew no harm could have come to me ; but I knew ho he felt ; for my own relief at seeing him safe again made me almost speechless .

I remember what you say , Mr. Wiswell , and I 'm grateful to you speaking so frankly . It 's possible , of course , that after tomorrow there 'll be no need for Loyalist regiments . I have a farm in Bloomingdale , from which the rebels have been kind enough to lish me , and tomorrow I hope to see the rebels walk into a trap somewhere in that neighborhood .

He had a mind that saw a military action in the st detail ; and as he explained the trap into which the rebels , thier stupidity , had again got themselves , my confidence , that hadlow the night before , again rose high . With warships anchored in the Hudson and the East River , on both   sides of New York island , to prevent the rebels from escaping by water , Howe needed only to send his regiments in barges up th East River to Kingsbridge , where a creek separated New York island from the mainland . Once Howe 's troops had landed at Kingsbridg the rebels would be cooped up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cordon from the Hudson to the East Rive move slowly southward toward the lower tip of the island , an capture every fort , gun , officer and regiment within that enormo trap . All the people in New York seemed to be on the main road leadi northward  --  the road on the high land , midway between the t rivers . Some , we were certain , were rebel sympathizers fleeing in car and carryalls from the inevitable capture of the city by Howe 's arm but by far the greater number were Loyalists , joyously traveling o to see the discomfiture of those who for years had threatened the with the loss of their homes , property and country . Whatever their sympathies , every last one was adrip with perspi tion ; for the breeze , what there was of it , was fiery hot , and the s like molten brass in a pallid sky .

At all crossroads stood sentries , counterparts of the prisoners had captured by hundreds at the battle of Long Island : shambli dejected-looking , badly clothed , unkempt , unsoldierly . They block every attempt to move from the inland road down to the shore , a with peremptory head-jerkings and thumb-pointings motioned all us to stay on the upper road . At Murray Hill , less than an hour from Serle 's house , Cruger call a halt . The place filled me with homesickness , for it was Milton I1 in miniature . The farmhouse on its highest point was high a square , with white columns like those on Governor Hutchinso house ; and the easterly slope of the hill was rolling land , set off wi ' stone walls into orchards and cornfields , and bounded at the f by the blue waters of the East River .

" We couldn'ta better place to stop , " he said . " This hill 's the highest land ween the Bowery and Kingsbridge , so if Howe moves his men across from Long Island , we can see him almost as soon as he starts , keep abreast of him wherever he goes .

" Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They ought to go ve miles farther north , abreast of Kingsbridge . " crhaps they 're more useful here , " I said . " Suppose Howe 's troops up-river in boats .

" You do n't really think , Mr. Stedman , that would rather take New York than destroy the rebel army ! " That 's exactly what I think , " Stedman said . " Oliver and I have him fight before . Either he does n't know what the true objective of a soldier is , or he thinks he can frighten the rebels i submission by taking America 's largest city and making faces them . " Cruger sighed . " Dear me , dear me ! Soldiers ought to be for by law to read Caesar . Then they 'd know that no battle is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made wholly uscle They 'd also know that it 's essential , in war , to move fast . " " Howe would n't , " Stedman said . Cruger was silent . We watched people hurrying along the du road behind us  --  laughing people , apprehensive people , people N shouted and sang in gay anticipation of what the day would bri forth . Many of them came down from the road into the meadow which we sat , until the fields were dotted thick with groups t stared and stared across the blue strip of water before us tow Long Island . The morning was two-thirds gone when Cruger pointed across river . The tip of a distant green point that jutted into that sat blue water seemed to have bloomed into a rosy flower .

There was no end to those scarlet-laden boats . We could see t oar blades shimmering in the hot sunlight . There seemed to thousands of them . " All those men ! " Cruger said unhappily . " All those regime obliged to carry out orders that mean nothing ! I wish  --  " We never knew what he wished . Flame and smoke jetted from sides of the five warships in the mouth of the little bay bene us . The stillness of that Sunday morning ended in overwhelm thunder  --  a sustained and universal crashing that drove hot gusts air against our eyeballs and set the flesh to crawling beneathclothes .

Their faces had a harried , wolfish look ; they ran with animal-like stoopings and scuttlings ; their mouths were open and they breathed gaspingly wittongues showing red and thick , a most distressing spectacle . While still they pelted upward over the hillslope to go panting off to the northward , long lines of rebel companies came toward on the upper road from the direction of the city . At the same tim from the opposite direction , a group of officers in plain blue unifor spurred their horses along that same road and halted at the upp edge of the orchard , where the running men were tumbling over stone wall into the road .

Tway up the hillslope the long red line of Howe 's regiments ed inexorably on . Just above us , on the upper road , the rebelents straggled north , while Washington and his staff hurried to t them. c heard Washington shouting in a flat , high-pitched voice that t have been audible to all those marching men , " Get behind the sl Get behind the walls ! " the very moment of his shouting we saw something we could ly believe we were seeing , even though it was as clear to our as though it happened on the palms of our hands . Those three hing rebel regiments seemed to explode , and , in the exploding , ssolve . It was as though the long lines of marching men hadd to smoke ; had gone swirling and drifting in tattered wisps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road . st they seemed to be driven and whirled by gusts that traveled before the advancing scarlet columns , just as dust is driven by the wind that goes before a thunderstorm . In the twinkling of an eye those regiments ceased to be regimen and became a mob without leaders , courage , wits or strength rabble , willing to purchase safety at any cost , and at any man 's c pence . They scurried along that upper road and through the fields o either side like autumn leaves plucked from beneath a fence by November gale . I felt Stedman shaking me ; heard him shouting despairing ! " They 'll get away ! God damn it , I knew they 'd get away ! " I could only stand , shaking with excitement and with a sort shamed exultation , and watch a few officers and even Washingto himself wave their arms and hurl themselves from one side of t road to the other in a fruitless effort to stem this unstemmable to rent . If ever I saw a pitiable spectacle , it was Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have used a goad on stampeding co He leaned far out over his horse 's neck , slapping and slashing with t blade , first on one side , then on the other , trying to halt those runni men . His mouth was wide open from the violence of his shouting his face deathly pale and glistening with sweat . He shifted his sworn into his bridle hand , leaned from his saddle , caught man after ma and threw them to the ground , only to have them slide from beneath his horse like minnows , and like minnows wriggle and dart off to t northward . He swung himself back into the saddle , jumped his horse into orchard beside us to intercept a group of running men ; but neith shouting , cursing nor sword-striking affected them . He looked sick and shattered . His sword hung slack beside hi the bridle was loose in his fingers .

Drums were beating along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more rapidly , not more than a half-pist shot away . I do n't know whether Washington kicked his ho toward it , or whether the horse moved instinctively towardsound of drums . Whatever the reason , he took a few steps forwa his ears pricked up.  | " Well , well , " Cruger said coolly . " There 's an opportunity ! If I were command of those redcoats , I 'd take Washington prisoner or sign my commission . " I think he was right . What 's more , I think Washington would ever have raised a hand to help himself ; for if ever a man was induced by shame to overwhelming disgust and despair , that man Is Washington . He just sat there , his face gray and sagging . When n shouted warningly , he paid no attention . Then two blue-coated cers galloped into the orchard and up to their commander .

Once more Howe had won , but the Is had again escaped.  |p366THE  whole headquarters staff of the British Army moved Murray Hill from Kip 's Bay in the center of the long line of trod that had sent the rebels scurrying off to the north . They were there , magnificent in brilliant uniforms  --  Howe , Percy , Clint Cornwallis , Vaughan , Leslie , the Hessian generals and all their ai and satellites . " My God , " Stedman said , " look at Howe ! He 's pleased ! He 's s ing ! He thinks he 's done well ! " There was no doubt about it .

The long line of regiments , with Howe and his staff as an a began a turning movement that swung the line across the up and lower roads at right angles . As the regiments came into portion they stacked their muskets , lowered their heavy knapsacks to t ground ; unbuttoned their scarlet jackets and mopped the swc bands of their hats with wisps of grass . " Dear me , " Cruger said . " They 're stopping here ! They 're going on ! " " My God , " Stedman whispered , " do n't tell me he 's going to in another mistake ! " " I fear he will make a mistake if he does n't throw his troops the way across the island , " Cruger said . " Ca n't you tell him so ? " I asked . " My dear Mr. Wiswell , " Cruger protested .

He was a gaudy thing in a brassoiledblue coat and pink-striped breeches , and when the troops ted coarse pleasantries to him as he rode along their front , he sat straighter in the saddle and lifted his nose higher. hen he came to the officers , we heard him say , " Personal letter Mrs. Murray to Sir General Mr. Lord Howe , and an answer ly requested !

Even in this short time I had something in him that gave me unbounded confidence in his judgment . If ever I should be caught more deeply in this war , I knew I 'd be content to fight under Cruger 's leadership . It was around noon when Howe and his staff had vanished betwe the white columns of Mrs. Murray 's house . An hour later Buell galloped along the upper road from the ci When we shouted to him , he brought his horse to a plunging st The horse was black with sweat and streaked with lather . Half climbing , half falling from his saddle , Buell pulled at inner part of his breeches , wriggling himself within them as a woman frees herself from the pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an opening in the stone wall , and led his horse through it a toward us . A young lieutenant instantly ran forward , shouting , " None that ! Let those walls alone ! Let everything else alone around It Get back outside that wall ! I 've a damned good mind to make build it up again ! " " Well , " Buell said , " I was wondering why you fellows came o here ! You 're just taking care of the walls ! " The lieutenant looked contemptuous . " You 'll find out what w doing when the general comes out and finds that wall broke down ! " " When he comes out ? " Buell asked . " What 's he inside of ? who is he ? " I caught at his shoulder to silence him ; but he shook me off a again spoke to the lieutenant . " Where is he ? " he asked again . " is n't he out here where he belongs ? My God , man , what 's he think of ! " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palm against his chest and pushed him back . " List he said , " do you know what 's on the other side of that ridge ? " He pointed past the Murray house , over the top of the hill and the direction of the Hudson . " There 's another road over there  --  a road out of New York road that a regiment or a dozen regiments could march along slick as a whistle . " The lieutenant just stared . Buell tapped a finger against the lieutenant 's gorget . " Lis brother : I just came out from New York by way of that road . I ha gone more'n half a mile when I caught up with a whole darnp369'vision of rebel troops , headed by that old windbag , Putnam . There s three brigades  --  fifteen regiments . While I was passing ' em , they ged off the road and went into the woods between the road and Hudson . They 're marching past you , hidden in those woods , It now  --  fifteen regiments ! What are you going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buell like a fish in a glass jar . Listen , " Buell told him . " What in God 's name are you waiting for ? There 's no rebels on this side of the island . Get over on the er side , where you belong , and capture a few generals and nels and brigades ! Put an end to this war , for God 's sake ! " or everybody 's sake , " Stedman said harshly. he lieutenant could n't seem to understand . " Our orders are to here , " he said . " The general issued those orders himself . " They 're all at that house on the hill , " I told Buell . " They 're drinkteawith Mrs. Murray , all of ' em : Howe , Clinton , Cornwallis , Leslie , Vaughan  --  every last one of ' em . " hen for Christ 's sake go there ! " Buell shouted . " Take this damnedof mine that 's worn all the skin off my tail , and go to Mrs. rray 's and tell Howe that Putnam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oliver , you ride , and Stedman and I 'll hangthe stirrups and go with you ! " ere was a sentry at the door of the Murray house , and he did n't let us past . He 'd had his orders that the general wasn'tdisturbed , and he was one of those oft-encountered individuals would rather see a nation ruined than risk five minutes ' unpleasantnessfor himself . Yet he was n't a dolt ; for when he saw the c that Buell turned on the windows , he summoned other ties to keep us from doing what one of us surely would otherhavedone  --  thrust a fist through a pane and shouted the tidings everybody in the house would hear. c tried hard to change that sentry 's mind . For his benefit Buellof Howe 's baronetcy . " They knighted him for letting all the s , including Washington , get away from Long Island , " Buell " They 'll have to make this sentry a duke for letting ' em gethere. " by should they ?

Any incompetent officer might ' a ' let ' em escape . But here a feller 's got to be a plumb ass ! They ought t0 make this sentry Earl Hindquarters for his day 's work ! " We looked hopefully at the sentry , but he only stood there motion less , staring past us to the green hillslope running down to the shore of the East River and to the long lines of troops resting idl upon that slope while Putnam 's division drifted unmolested through the woods behind us . " I found Leighton , " Buell told me , while we sat in the field acros from the Murray house waiting for Howe and his officers to coin out . " He 'd been put on one of the little prison ships  --  one tha had been a cattle ship . She had n't been cleaned out  --  not in the part where they put Soame . He had to sleep on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sleep on manure ! " Stedman moved his arms backward and forward in his coat a though something bound him unendurably . " Bunker Hill ! " h exclaimed . " Halifax  --  Long Island  --  Kip 's Bay  --  Cunningham  --  priso ers sleeping on manure ! To hell with it ! I 'd rather get myself killed than stand on one side and watch idiots throw this country away I 'm going to see Cruger and raise those two hundred Germans . " H meant it . " Could n't you do anything about Soame ? " I asked Buell . " Not much , Oliver . I tried , though . I got drunk with one of Cu ningham 's clerks , and sat up all night printing forty-dollar notes f him  --  gave him twenty thousand dollars , so 's he 'd let me know wha was going on . Then I had a little talk with Cunningham and tol him some things he did n't know about using cattle ships for priso ships , and having prisoners sleep on manure  --  told him how th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and steamy and war in winter . " He spat . " He did n't believe me , but I guess he 'll move Soame . Ye sir , I do n't believe he 'll let Soame stay in a place where he mig possibly be comfortable under some conditions . " He gave me an uneasy glance . " I guess I was right . He docsn like Soame and he does n't like you . If he can , he 'll put Soame whc no human being can stay alive . If you want to help Soame Leighto see Howe and see him quick ! " Not until three o'clock did Howe and his officers come out of th Murray house . They 'd been in there three hours  --  three hours duringp371which England 's finest troops stood idly on a hillslope while their enemies ran to safety on the other side of the hill . When they emerged on the porch of the Murray house , their empty laughter was muted by the heat waves that shimmered above the 1 ( 1 ; but the exasperation within us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our homes for us , perhaps throwing away r country beneath our very eyes , was a constantly growing rending our bowels. n the cool of the afternoon , Howe 's troops spread out in a long across the island and moved down on the city  --  moved down to it and into it without a shot being fired against them ; but ry ragged , thievish , timorous soldier in the whole rebel army , ry shambling captain , ever bucolic colonel , every one of their idcring generals had run away to fight another day. cw York went wild at Howe 's arrival . Its citizens thronged the ts , cheering , weeping with delight as his troops went by ; and hing in the city was his for the asking . He was given a mansion himself and a cozy little home for Mrs. Loring , and all the city cried to pay its admiring respects to the man who had at lastd it from the hated rule of the rebels . He was dined and he was d ; he was praised and he was thanked. r @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insufficient activity !

It four days passed before we were admitted to see him ; and ine four days Howe had done little more than he had done after Hill or after Long Island . He had eaten and drunk and bled with Mrs. Loring ; he 'd appointed a new government for city and ceremoniously conferred with hundreds of Loyalists ; d taken steps to appraise all rebel property , so that it might be to those the rebels had so long intimidated. khaps those things were necessary ; but four days are four days . Ih can happen in that length of time ; and it seemed clear to Sted- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rebels must surd be mending their tattered clothes , filling their powder horns , getting decent food into their bellies , and recovering at least a little of th self-respect they had lost at Long Island and Kip 's Bay . We suspected , too , that in those four days Cunningham had beer to Howe and , in his soothing way , told Howe a pack of lies about Soame Leighton . Certainly when Buell and I were at last admitted to headquarters Howe 's manner towards me , for the first time , was as sullen as his face . While I told him , as briefly as I could , about the persecution a Soame Leighton , he stabbed with a quill pen at the pot of shot it which the pen stood when not in use . When I finished , he tossed the pen impatiently on his desk and answered me in a long-suffering voice . " Are n't you making a great to-do , Mr. Wiswell , about a rebel officer of no importance whatever If I understand the case correctly , his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's gone out of his way to mall himself offensive . " " I wo n't try to deny it , sir , " I said , " but there are a few things I 'd like to mention , if you 'll bear with me . " Howe grumbled a reluctant assent . " Well , sir , " I said , " this officer was my close and dear friend fore the war started . He 's still that , and I 'm bound to do what I can for him . In the second place , if Captain Leighton sho resentment at his treatment , I 'm forced to say that any man of sp. would have done the same . Captain Cunningham " " Now see here , Mr. Wiswell , " the general said , " if a command in chief attempted to busy himself with all the details of his army he 'd go mad . I ca n't listen to fancied grievances against Caput Cunningham . In this particular instance , the provost marshal answerable only to the Crown . His behavior and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppress a rebellion and to defeat the rebel army . " " It certainly is , General , " Buell said heartily , " and we hope you figure how to do it ! " Howe turned a hard eye on Buell , and his voice , when he went was irascible . " This whole business of rebel prisoners , Mr. Wisw is most annoying ! You 've seen them  --  ignorant , lousy , half stary riffraff ! Now in any ordinary war we can get rid of our prisonp373exchanging them for our own men who 've been captured . t this is n't an ordinary war , Mr. Wiswell ! The Congress that tends to be governing the rebellious colonies refuses to do one coned thing for the rebels we capture ! They wo n't exchange for gym ; they wo n't feed them ; they wo n't write to them ; they wo n't Id them clothes or comforts . Nobody ever comes to see themerfriends , relatives nor officers . Apparently nobody cares ther they live or die . It 's a trying situation  --  one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " hen Buell opened his mouth to speak , I kicked his ankle . I d see I was really annoying Howe by asking him to interest elf in a rebel prisoner . He may have felt that for him to interinsuch matters would be bad for discipline . Perhaps it would been . I doubt that he was a party to Cunningham 's sharp pracs , as Buell always insisted , or that he reaped any of the benefitsthem . I knew for certain , however , that nothing I could say would ace him to interfere in Soame Leighton 's case . That meant , of , that whatever was done for Soame , I 'd have to do myself . ell , sir , " I said to Howe , " I 'm grateful to you for listening . ke to ask one favor . " we spoke fretfully .

" Outside the city . I want outside the city . " tside the city ? " Howe asked . " Is n't that taking quite a risk all results , Mr. Wiswell ? I 've had hopes  --  your feelings being they are  --  that you might be of great value to the Loyalist cause way I have n't mentioned .

If they can run all over New En land safely , so can Buell and I  --  provided we 're dressed as they arc : " And smell the way they do , " Buell added cheerfully . " That ain'teasy , General , but it can be done . " Howe looked gloomy , but drew a piece of paper toward him a scratched upon it the order that gave me the privilege of tryinggo back to Milton and to Sally.  |p375THE  Boston Road , when we trudged out of New York , as an endless straggling procession of rebel militiamen , all putting much distance between themselves and Washington 's army as ey could ; and not one of them , so far as we could discover , was wing any trifling compunction at deserting the rebel cause when was most in need .
