From London Daily Expressmen overseas came congratulatory cables for plump , pink , self-confident Editor in Chief Arthur Christiansen . London staffers and Fleet Street competitors bought him double Scotches at Poppin 's and The Bell and The Codgers , his favorite pubs . <P> There was a spirited ( and spirituous ) dinner party at London 's glossy Dorchester Hotel , and a private lampooning edition of the Daily Express , devoted entirely to " Chris . " From Express Owner Lord Beaverbrook , now busy with Britain 's postwar air problems , came this message : " As long as you remain editor you will have . . . the happiest proprietor . " <P> Reasons for all this huzzahing : 1 ) 39-year-old Arthur Christiansen last week began his eleventh year as top editorial executive of London 's biggest daily ; 2 ) his first ten years had been terrific . <P> When he took the job , he said his goal was to increase Express circulation ( then 1,700,000 ) by one million in ten years . He almost did it in five . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( now 2,800,000 ) would be much larger . When English publications were granted 10% more paper several weeks ago , Express circulation shot up 250,000 almost overnight . <P> Hard Work and Schmalz . Editor Christiansen 's success is due partly to hard work , partly to his unchanging conviction that folks like to read about events which burst from the emotions of men &; women , partly to " The Beaver 's " penchant for young hustlers in top jobs . <P> Personally kind but professionally exacting , Chris ceaselessly pinpricks his " Beaver 's Eaglets " into working harder . He does not hesitate to fire them for repeated blunders , is just as quick to spread praise on thick for jobs well done . His men swear by him , call him Chris , like the way he hobnobs with the greenest beginners in off-hours , buying drink for drink with them . <P> Nightly in the " reporters ' room " - frenzied and cluttered with teletypes , telephones , stale sandwiches , cups of tea , personalities , smoke , temperament , bitter grins and rush-he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent unrivaled in Fleet Street , he picks out of heaps of copy the stories that fit his line , plays them for all they are worth , with a fine disregard for what his staider competitors do . <P> The Express is no scandal sheet , but Arthur Christiansen 's brand of journalism has a distinctly yellow hue . There is nothing in the U.S. quite comparable to it . In appearance and content it is more like the Hearst papers than anything else-copiously illustrated , splashy with black headlines , trickily laid out . <P> Its four pages are usually crowded with war news from crack correspondents like Alan Moorehead in Algiers , C. V. R. Thompson in New York . But the Express is at its best on stories about murders , sex , abandoned babies and the more maudlin doings of Soho underworldlings . The U.S. staff ( three reporters in New York , a man each in Washington , Chicago , Los Angeles ) files about 3,000 words daily , is never surprised to get a cable like : " RUSH <P> FULL STORY DEANNA DURBIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
