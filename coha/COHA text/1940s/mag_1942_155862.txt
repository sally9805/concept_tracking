Japan stood at the edge of the world gambling table last week and watched to see if her reckless bet would pay off . <P> Japan could remember her hoarding of little white chips for this desperate try . She could remember the hoarding of steel-the bathtubs and radiators salvaged from Shanghai houses which had been bombarded with Japanese steel ; the hoarding of oil-the boatloads of it wheedled from the U.S. against the eventual drive for oil ; the hoarding of young men-hardened to horror on the cold plains of Manchukuo and in the hot valley of the Yangtze . For the sake of the chips there had been abnegation : less rice , less fish , less charcoal , no taxi rides , a minimum of sake , stinting on geishas , wood-pulp clothes . <P> After Dec. 7 nearly the whole pile of savings had been spread , widely and with studied recklessness , on the table : 200 planes over Pearl Harbor , scores of transports off Malaya , 200,000 men thrown at Luzon , oil burned up in submarine raids off California , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squandered at Hong Kong , shrapnel consumed in a new Chinese offensive , cruisers risked in an attack on Sarawak , precious bombs dropped on Sumatra and Burma-a total bet of nearly all Japan 's power . At best Japan stood to lose far more than she could replace soon ; at worst , everything . <P> The extent of the risk was so great as to be almost admirable . <P> Last week as the wheel ticked around to the tell-off it looked as if the bet had been placed not only riskily , but well . It looked as if Japan might win far more than she had staked and might win it the only way she could , quickly . Already she had achieved naval supremacy in the western Pacific , air supremacy in the Philippines and Malaya . She had taken Guam , Wake , Mindanao , Hong Kong , Sarawak , most of Luzon , nearly half of Malaya . <P> Japan was convinced by her apparent success-to-be that the only way to win is to risk .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
