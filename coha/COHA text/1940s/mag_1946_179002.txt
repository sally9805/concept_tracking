DAVID THE KING-Gladys Schmitt-Dial ( $3 ) . <P> David the King , a full-bodied ( 631-page ) retelling of the great Biblical story by the author of The Gates of Aulis ( TIME , June 15,1942 ) , is the March choice of The Literary Guild and the Religious Book Club . <P> The story of David , the spoiled shepherd poet who climbed into royal favor , betrayed King Saul and his people , took over the throne , ruled Israel in her march from primitivism to the brink of decadence , and declined among the dissensions , rapes , assassinations , and revolutionary plots of his children , then sought and found his God at last-is one of mankind 's archetypical legends . Miss Schmitt has chosen to tell it not as a historical or Biblical but a psychological novel . In this task she suffers from a serious handicap : as a novelist , she is not very adventurous ; as a psychologist , not very interesting . <P> She is aware that David 's middle-aged infatuation with Bathsheba must have been suffused with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the odd fact that , until he was King , David was capable of begetting only one child , and that by an adolescent girl who worshiped him as if he were King . She develops David 's crookedly loyal captain Joab into a conscienceless foil for her almost equally sinful but conscience-torn hero ; but she explains David 's lifelong forbearance towards Joab only by the phrase , " a nameless fear . " Her examinations of religious and mystical experience are sometimes emotionally convincing , but so loosely generalized that the reader nods at , without believing or suffering , David 's intuitions of " other Jahvehs " - one of love , for example , or one who is blind and heartless . <P> A-Budget Casting-As a straight storyteller and creator of character , Novelist Schmitt is often very competent , but on a high-mediocre level which suggests that , in trying to write a universal story to be universally read , she has tempered her imagination and intelligence to the shorn middlebrow . Under Biblical sanction , there are a lot of women with alerted breasts and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which a man is displayed " naked except for his loincloth . " The characterization , generally perceptive , but never " difficult , " is smooth and simplified enough to suggest A-budget movie casting . But Author Schmitt has managed to give her hero 's miscellaneous career overall unity by using it to illustrate her chief idea : that so long as conscience survives , man learns not only from the good he tries to do but perhaps even more so from the evil he does . <P> Miss Schmitt claims to have written every sentence in her book no less than three times . At its ardent best , her style is hopeful and reverent , rather than adequate . Amidst such prose , an occasional direct quotation from Samuel I or II comes like the blow of a hammer through a cotton work glove .
