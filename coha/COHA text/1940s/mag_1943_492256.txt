DURING the spring of 1897 George Donaldson appeared on the streets of his native Glasgow after an absence of fifty years . He had returned to die . Behind him in the United States he left a reputation for eccentricity and much property , among the minor iterm- of which was a cave . The cave  --  not much of a cave as caverns go  --  burrowed under a wooded hillside in Southern Indiana . It was one of George Donaldson 's favorite hide-outs . He liked the stream of water which ran through it and frothed out of the mouth to splash down the rocky hill in a minia  --  ture cataract . Being something of a naturalist , he noted that within the waters of his cave swam some queer fish  --  bleached and futile fish with no spirit . When George Donaldson bought his cave , there was a bustling little village in the valley below . It was called Spring Mill and was a pleasant place of stout stone and log houses dominated by a big stone grist  --  mill . From his Land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear the water rushing through a big flume to turn an overshot water wheel . George Donaldson sow the village die . As the years slipped by he saw the villagers move away one by one . The great water wheel turned less and less frequently . Presently it stopped altogether . But that did n't bother George Donaldson . He liked solitude and he liked the wilderness . He was n't concerned to see weeds creep in , see the water wheel decay and fall apart . George Donaldson would be surprised today if he could know that the village of Spring Mill has come to life again ; that it looks as it looked when he first saw it ; that its wide lawns are lush and close-cropped , its flower beds gay with blossoms , smoke curling from the stone chimneys ; that the water wheel creaks and groans again as it helps grind quantities of yellow corn . He would be even more surprised could he know that one of the principal reasons the village of Spring Mill lives again lies within the cave which he owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is his colony of odd fish . Donaldson 's bleached and unhappy fish are a vital link in a chain of strange circumstances , which chiefly concern Spring Mill village . Those who are expert in such matters call it the finest example of a pioneer village of the wilderness period to be found anywhere . They any that its great stone gristmill is without a peer . Spring Mill village in 1943 exists as it existed in 1843 , when its fame had spread throughout the whole new wilderness land . The effect on the observer is startling , but it is accomplished by no artifice. ft is the result of location . Nature provided a stage and iso  --  lated it by guardian hills clothed in a great forest against the intrusion of any sound or sight which might mar its perfection . Col. Richard Lieber , the practical visionary who dis  --  covered the dead village and brought it back to life with cunning patience , puts it this way : You come down from the top of the hill two hundred feet and you go back one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young naval officer named Samuel Jackson . A Canadian , he had fought under Perry on Lake Erie and had been wounded . He came to the wilderness of Southern Indiana , seeking land . It is not difficult to understand why he selected the land he chose . Any sailor would recognize the virtue of a quiet cove , protected on all sides by high hills . Ensign Jackson chose just such a spot , a tiny valley hemmed in by very steep and wooded hills . Ensign Jackson built a cabin and a small gristmill . He opened a limestone quarry in one of the rocky hill  --  sides , perhaps the first in a region which was later to become famous for its stone . In 1816 his title to the land was confirmed by a grant signed by the President of the United States . But Jackson was a sailor at heart and the ways of the wilderness were not his ways . The next year he sold his lands , his houses , his little mill to Cuthbert and Thomas Bullitt , of Louisville , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains from Virginia a few years before . They were very busy as wilderness real-estate pro  --  moters , buying lands all through the great forest of Southern In  --  diana for townsites . They appeared to specialize in gristmills , and saw in Jackson 's tiny valley with its foaming spring-fed stream a spe  --  cial opportunity . In almost no time at all they had a bustling crew of stonemasons , mechanics and carpenters at work . They planned a great gristmill , the largest anywhere in the region , with walls of hewn stone three feet thick , boasting a tremendous over  --  shot water wheel turned by a pro  --  digious stream of water carried to the mill through a wooden flume riding a procession of stone piers . For the time and the place , the undertaking was fabulous , but it was an immediate success . In no time at all Bullitt 's Mills was a thriving community , its mill grinding meal for pioneer farmers for miles around . But the Bullitts were promoters . After seven years they had a chance to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brothers , William and Joseph Montgomery , of Philadelphia . They , in turn , put up additional buildings of log and stone , which included a tavern and a still house , and sold the property after nine years to still a third pair of brothers , Hugh and Thomas Hamer . The period of promotion and absentee ownership was over . Hugh Hamer was a miller , having been mill manager on the property for the Montgomerys . The two brothers ' took up residence at the village in two large stone houses originally built by the Bullitts . They acquired possession of the village in 1832 , just eighteen years after Ensign Jack  --  son had discovered his sheltered cove in the forest . A great deal had been done in the eighteen years , but , with the exception of the cen  --  tral mill building and the two large stone houses , it was still very much a crude wilderness hamlet . The flamers set about to make it the commercial and social center of a wide region . They succeeded , keep  --  ing pace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It developed a settled grace , even a certain ele  --  gance . Wide lawns spread around the clustering buildings , protected against marauding pigs and cattle by low stone walls . The area be  --  tween the two main dwellings occu  --  pied by the brothers became a somewhat formal garden , which at one time boasted the splendor of strutting peacocks . As the opportunity arose , new activities were added , so that on either side of the central mill building stretched village shops and industries . There were a tavern , a regular stage stop between Louisville and Terre Haute , a still house , a loom house , a pottery , The water from the flume , escaping over the great mill wheel , turned the machinery of a sawmill . There were a cobbler 's shop , a battery , a cabinet shop , an apothecary , is tannery and blacksmith shop , a limekiln and a post office . There were ( Conlinood on Pogo 54 ) ( Continued from Pegs 27 ) a church and a school and various resi  --  dences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamer combined enterprise with showmanship . His ox fleets were famous on the rutted hill road between Spring Mill and Louisville , some fifty miles to the southeast . The great , high-wheeled wagons were painted a brilliant red . Each was drawn by a team of twelve oxen whose horns were brightly polished and snubbed with shiny brass balls . As his facilities increased , the enterprising Hamer sent his products into wider and wider mar  --  kets . Barges built in his boat yard car  --  ried lumber , grain , flour , pork and whisky as far south as New Orleans . They were bustling times . The young state was growing fast . Steady streams of new colonists swarmed down the river to the south and followed the road north from Louisville . In all this new growth Spring Mill village was strategic . The future was bright with hope . Someday it would be a city . There was no doubt of it . Socially , the village kept pace . Many a notable of the day visited there , in  --  cluding the governor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President of the United States . Not in  --  frequent guests at the tavern were dis  --  tinguished intellectuals from that revo  --  lutionary communal colony at New Har  --  mony . It is not difficult to imagine the ap  --  pearance of the growing village at the height of the Hamer period of owner  --  ship . It is preserved in the re-creation of it today . The village area itself occupied the comparatively flat valley floor , an area of some eight hundred feet in length by six hundred in width . It was cleared except for scattered shade trees . In the center stood the great mill . Beside it ran a roadway , twisting down from the crest of the southern hills . Most of the shops and industries flanked the road . The dwellings were scattered over the rest of the valley , ex  --  cept for the stone houses of the owners immediately opposite the mill . The wooden flume , riding high on massive stone piers , paralleled the road . From the edge of the village clearing , the hills , magnificently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They sheltered the village against storm and intrusion . They were both a frame and a bulwark , giving unity and an aspect of special charm . The heyday of Spring Mill was in the 50 's . Toward the end of that decade there came a flurry of excitement . A rail  --  way was building west . It was to be called the Ohio and Mississippi . It would link the region with the seaboard on the east and the limitless new lands to the west . If it came to Spring Mill , it would mean a great new growth , new opportu  --  nities , a boom . The Town That Time Forgot But the engineers running their grade lines had different ideas . They took one look at the guardian hills which flanked the village and ran their stakes several miles to the north . Though no one knew it at the time , it was the end of Spring Mill . The railway was completed in 1859 , and from that time on , the decline of the village began . Hugh Hamer kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1872 . ' I hereafter for a few years another owner kept the distillery and the mill running . But it was no use . The village was doomed . In the meantime , the eccentric Mr. Donaldson moved in . He bought hill land to the south of the village , including a cave . Hugh Hamer was still alive and still very much a personage , but he was an old man and he knew that his village was under a blight . With the death of Hamer the spotlight of community in  --  terest switched to Donaldson , who was a showman of parts himself . It was his habit to journey to church each Sunday in a dugout canoe pulled over the forest trail by a saddle horse . It was a tradition of the region that Donaldson would be called in to stand as godfather for each newborn babe , and if the parents agreed to let him name the child , there was always a generous cash contribution . Many a child named by Donaldson lived to regret the privi  --  lege . One he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Spring Mill was completely negative . The lands which he owned lay to the south of the village , athwart the only practical break in the hills by which it could be reached . He was interested in his land to the extent that he wanted it left strictly alone . He preferred the natural forest to anything else and dis  --  couraged its molestation . Following his death , the Donaldson land , by reason of a complicated will involving a great con  --  gregation of heirs , came under the admin  --  istration of the Indiana courts . The Donaldson land acted , thus , as a seal against intrusion , preserving the natural setting of the village . Magic Out of a Cave But the events which were to bring the village back to life really began be  --  fore the death of Donaldson in Scotland in 1897 . At Indiana University , in Bloomington , a scientist named Dr. Carl H. Eigenmann was making a study of cave vertebrates . His inves  --  tigations had led him all over the world . Cave vertebrates , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abounds in limestone caves , Doctor Eigenmann decided to make an exhaus  --  tive study of the caves of the region . Six years after he began his study Doc  --  tor Eigenmann made the discovery of his career . In Donaldson 's cave , just outside the dead village of Spring Mill , he dis  --  covered a colony of queer fish . The thing which delighted the doctor was that all the fish were blind . He had been hunting for blind fish all over the world , and here , practically in his back yard , was the finest and most numerous family of them existing anywhere in the world . He named his famous fish the Amblyopsis , which means " dim-eyed . " He described them as resembling skinned catfish swimming on their backs . Delighted with his discovery , Doctor Eigenmann persuaded Indiana Univer  --  sity to acquire the Donaldson tract from the court , so that he might set up a permanent experiment station to investi  --  gate the blind fish . The university did so , and the good doctor went to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students and visiting scientists to Don  --  aldson 's cave . Frequently they passed through the abandoned village of Spring Mill , now grown up with weeds , its mill wheel fallen apart , its log buildings crum  --  bling . The next event occurred some twenty years after the good doctor had made his sensational discovery in Donaldson 's cave . In the late 20 's the state of Indiana had become acutely park conscious . Col. Richard Lieber , head of the Indiana Department of Conservation , had begun to develop a system of state parks . So popular were the now parks that every section of the state clamored for one . Colonel Lieber did not propose to scatter expensive state parka around . He made one inflexible rule . The state would not buy land for parks . The land must be donated , either by private individuals or by counties . A law permitting counties ( Confirmed on Peg ? 571 to " Ise money for park purposes was paste in the state legislature . The peo  --  ple of Lawrence County wanted a park . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was owned by Indiana University . It was richly wooded , too , and the cave on it was now famous , as were the fish that lived in the cave . But Colonel Lieber insisted that it was too small an area . The county must buy more land . It did  --  a considerable area Banking the Donaldson tract to the west , extending north . They offered it to the state as a park site . Colonel Lieber rambled around over the acquired land on an inspection trip . It was chiefly hill land roughly L-shaped . In the corner of the L , but not in the tract , was a flat . narrow valley . The colo  --  nel found the land good . The hills were richly forested , the caves interesting . It would make a good park . Then he looked down in the valley . As he regarded it he had a vision . " What about that ' ? " he asked of his 1 guide , pointing to the crumbling ruins I of an old mill thrusting up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the guide . " We 'll get rid of that old mill . Do n't bother about it . " I But the colonel had a different idea . In his vision he saw a pioneer village brought to life , flanked by green lawns , set among its guardian hills . He saw the village as the central feature of a park , the finest and most significant park he had ever projected . Who owned the village ' ? An investiga  --  tion was quickly made . It was owned by the Lehigh Portland Cement Company , which had bought the village site and considerable adjacent land to protect its water rights . The colonel went to work quickly . The state would not buy the land , but it would accept it as a gift . Gen. Harry Tresler , head of the cement company , saw the point . He made the gift on the condition that the colonel could make his village a reality . New Pioneers The restoration of Spring Mill village was an adventure in discovery . There was not a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The mill building stood , but it was an empty shell . All the cum  --  bersome mill machinery was gone . The water wheel was gone completely . The piers which carried the original flume had crumbled down , and the flume itself was not even a memory . Most of the houses had disappeared . Fragments of walls marked their foundations . The colonel had two cardinal principles in mind to guide his engineers and his craftsmen in their reconstruction plans . There must be no faking , no sham . The second principle grew out of the first . It was that , as far as possible , every bit of material which went into the re-creation must come from the region itself , prefer  --  ably from the original village quarry or the forests thereabouts . It was the colonel 's job , but he had able and enthusiastic assistants . To one of these , o young engineer named Denzil Doggett. goes the credit for an idea which was not a part of the original plan . It was the idea of restoring the village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The colonel 's original idea was that the village be restored as a memorial to a rich and vivid period of pioneer history . Doggett argued that if a village was going to be restored , why not actually have it work ? Let the mill grind corn , the saw  --  mill slash boards , the looms weave . Out of the Past Doggett even argued , though no one took him very seriously , that if the mill machinery was restored and permitted to grind corn , visitors would buy the meal they saw ground as a souvenir of their visit . At the time it was a novel idea . The colonel gave it his blessing , and Doggett and his assistants went to work . Their first job was to find out what the mill wheel had been like and what sort of mill machinery the mill had contained . Doggett went up and down the land talking to oldsters who could remember active mills , exploring the ruins of old abandoned gristmills . On the site all sorts of theories were evolved , calcula  --  tions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spring Mill wuter wheel had probably been a twenty-four-foot overshot wheel with buckets four feet wide . The theory was borne out by splash marks on the wall of the mill . But it was only a theory , and Doggett wanted proof positive . One day he and his associates were arguing about the matter . A segment of the theoretical wheel had been laid out with chalk on ( Confirmed on Pogo 59 ) ( Conlinued from Page 571 the mill floor . From outside came a shout . A workman had been digging in the bed of the village stream at some dis  --  tance from the mill . His pick had struck a long curved piece of half-rotten wood . It was a small section of the outer rim of the original wheel . It fitted the chalk plan on the floor perfectly . The axle for the wheel required a straight and perfect log twenty-five feet long and thirty inches in diameter when dressed . It should have been poplar , but no poplar tree of such a size could be found . Grudgingly , Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The reconstruction of the mill ma  --  chinery with its great wooden gears , its cunningly contrived transmission of power . was a puzzling problem , until someone found a rare volume published in 1830 and written by Oliver Evans . It contained complete , specific and detailed instructions . They were followed faith  --  fully , though frequently long periods elapsed in the rebuilding while men scoured the forests to discover types of wood specified by Millwright Evans . The original French burrs , huge atones sixty inches in diameter , were found buried in weeds . But sharpening a mill burr was apparently a lost art until an old miller who knew the knack was finally found . While the actual going on , help that ticity to the re  --  stored village was corning from all sorts of unexpected quarters . Word had gone out that the state was restoring a pioneer village and that contribu  --  tions of furniture and accessories appropriate to the period would be ac  --  ceptable . Attics and base  --  ments all over the state disgorged old beds and tables , chairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all aorta . A veritable flood of them descended upon the commit  --  tee placed in charge of such donations . Enough came in o refurnish com  --  pletely and re-equip most of the restored buildings . Typical of the public interest in the project was a letter received by Colonel Lieber one day , containing a check for $1000 . It had been sent by a pharmaceutical manufacturer whose father had been a pioneer pharmacist in Indiana during the period of Spring Mill . He wanted to donate the money to help restore and re-equip the village apothecary shop . So much material was contributed that enough remained after the village build  --  ings had been refurnished to provide a considerable pioneer museum which was housed on the third floor of the mill . From Vision to Reality A day came when the village was ready to live again . The mill was complete , the great wheel , hewn and fitted by hand , in place , the wooden flume restored . A stor  --  age bin was filled with shelled yellow corn , corn of the region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surged over the wheel . It turned slowly , groaning and creak  --  ing , turned faster and faster . Inside the mill the great burrs turned , throwing out the yellow meal . Colonel Lieber 's vision had become reality . The stream of curious came slowly at first , but swelled rapidly as the fame of the village spread . In recent years the number of visitors has reached such pro  --  portions that the state has been forced to put in tremendous parking areas to accommodate automobiles . But they are not near the village . You walk into the village up a wooded valley beside a rush  --  ing stream . The first glimpse of it is as dramatic as the lifting of a curtain on a stage , for the magic of the village has the reality of good theater . There is nothing at all to spoil it , no note of dis  --  harmony , no anachronism . Behind and on either side there is the backdrop of the wooded hills rising high and sheer under a narrow arc of the sky . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawn , are the buildings of stone and log , with the great central mill dominating the scene . You can poke about and stick your nose into the dwellings if you Like . They appear to have been deserted only yesterday . You may even find someone at work now and then , finishing up a bright homespun rug on a hand loom , for example . Echoes of Old America The gray-walled gardens are likely to be bright with flowers . They appear to have been growing there forever . As a matter of fact , many of them were there , fighting the weeds , when Colonel Lieber and his men marched down into he valley to rout the wilderness . It is curiuus that no one ever hurries who visits the vil  --  lage . It seems im  --  possible to do so . The spell of it is one of tranquillity . It is said thatone visitor returns each year from a distant state in the height of spring bloom be  --  cause the village acts on his jangled nerves as a bro  --  midic tonic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when a semblance of haste occurs among visitors frit  --  lows the deep clang  --  ing of a great bell hanging beside the mill . It announces that the mill will grind corn . The curious gather around , the water rushes and froths over the wheel , the burrs begin to spin and the yellow meal flies out to be scooped up and sacked in homespun sacks bearing a picture of the mill . Last year 22,680 five-pound sacks of meal were bought at the mill by visitors and carried into every state of the Union . Meteors epicures who refuse to use any corn meal other than that ground at Spring Mill . They return again and again for a new supply . The perfection of the village extends even to sound . For the sounds of the village are only the sounds that are familiar and nntural to it . The girdling forests shut out all others . There are the sounds of the forest itself  --  the bird sounds , the rustling of trees . Occasion  --  ally there is the deep whine of the saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow creaking of the mill wheel , rising to a heavy rumble whenever corn is being ground . But with all these special and in  --  termittent sounds there is one which makes a ceaseless music , the leitmotiv of the village , the sound of rushing water . From the dark caverns , with their strange blind fish , high on the hillsides , the clear streams come tumbling out over ancient rocks , surging into the flume , giving life to the mill and rushing on and out . It is the silver thread of life that has never been broken . Because of it , the im  --  aginative believe that the village was really not dead at all , only sleeping .
