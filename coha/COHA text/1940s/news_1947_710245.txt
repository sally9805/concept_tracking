Jr. , 55 years old , president of the Toledo , Peoria &; Western Railroad , where one of the country 's longest strikes has been waged for seventeen months , was shot and killed tonight by an unknown assailant .

Sutton , who lives in the same neighborhood , telephoned to the police after finding Mr. lying in the parkway in front of the Sutton home .

It was reported the police were told that an automobile was seen in the area at the time of the shooting and that it carried a bright spotlight which was trained on Mr. a moment before the fatal shot was fired . The railroad president had spent the evening attending a basketball game between Bradley College and Colorado University . His wife said he returned home about 10:30 P.M. and put his car in the garage but did not go in the house . It was believed he had decided to take a walk before retiring . Since 1926 , when he bought the little but strategic railroad at a receiver 's auction , Mr. had been a central figure in a dispute which has been marked many times by bloodshed and by the killing of two pickets a year ago . The 239-mile line crosses the State of Illinois and is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The current strife began before the war when Mr. discharged twenty-four men for allegedly engaging in sabotage against the railroad in an earlier labor dispute . Coupled with this trouble were issues concerning working conditions demanded by the Railroad Brotherhood and Mr. 's charges that the employes sought " featherbed " privileges . Government Seized ' Road The trouble so interfered with operation of the road that the Government took it over in March , 1942 , and operated it for the dura-tion of the war . The strike was I resumed in full force the day the Government returned the line to Mr. after international hostilities ceased . An individualist whose employes said he had built the railroad from I " two streaks of rust " into a valuable property , Mr. could not see why he should not be allowed to run his railroad in his own ways .

They told of his determination when he was turned down for a commission in the Army Engineering Corps during World War I because he lacked practical experience to fill out his university training . Mr. took a job as a section hand and later was commissioned a first lieutenant . Took Training at a Bank Here When he returned from France and found that the engineering firm for which he had worked was in bankruptcy , he turned down a $5,000-a-year job with another concern to enter the training school of a New York bank at $100 a month . He studied banking and financing .

But he did ride the line from beginning to end many times , talking con-. stantly with conductors , engineers and the men in the shops . " The road finally was ordered sold in bankruptcy and Mr. , who had failed in attempts to get New York backing , sold all his securities and went to Chicago to seek further backing . He sent a message to his wife : " Bought road for one million three . " He Put Up 5 Per Cent of Price Mr. made a dow ' payment of $65,000 , which was 5 per cent of the purchase price .

In 1929 Mr. said he won the first strike the railroad brotherhoods had ever lost . He actively engaged in the efforts to end the dispute and rode the front of his trains through picket lines . He said he would never ask his employes to do what he dared not do himself . Throughout the following years he improved railroad equipment and built up freight business . The road was one of the few to make money during the depression of the Nineteen Thirties . Mr. was born in Petaluma , Calif. , on June 15 , 1891 . He was educated at Hitchcock Military Academy , San Rafael , and the University of California . In 1918 . he received a mechanical engineering degree at Cornell.
