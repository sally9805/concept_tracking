( See Cover <P> CASS TIMBERLANE-Sinclair Lewis-Random House ( $2.75 ) . <P> On Main Street one day last week George F. Babbitt , Booster , ran into Honest Jim Blausser , Hustler . Above them ( in the words of their creator , Novelist Sinclair Lewis ) " the towers of Zenith aspired above the morning mist . " <P> Said Honest Jim : " I certainly was astonished in the streets of our lovely little city , the other day-a knocker ! " <P> " Who d' ya mean ? " <P> " Harry S. Lewis from Gopher Prairie-I mean Sauk Centre-this writing fellow that calls himself Sinclair Lewis . " <P> " Well now , Jim , " said George Babbitt ; " maybe you had n't ought to be too hard on old Red Lewis . You do n't want to forget he made me and you and . . . . " <P> " Sure , how can I forget it ? And he made us and this Great Country the laughing stock of the whole world , did n't he ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know that you should look at it just that way . Say , did you hear that Lewis got nearly 500,000 smackers for this new book of his before it was even published ? " <P> " Five hundred thousand bucks ! You mean they gave him all that money just to write a book ? Why , that 's half a million dollars ! " <P> " Yes , sir . " <P> " That 's Big Money . Why , with all that we made for him in those other books-if this socialistic income tax did n't take most of it away from him-he must be a millionaire . Why , he 's Big Business . " <P> " Yes , sir . " <P> " Now the way I think , this Lewis kind of put you and me and this place on the map . He certainly is a funny bird , but it 's like in sales-pulling letters , you can give the clients the lovey-dovey stuff or you can give ' em the old one-two . Red Lewis gives ' em the old one-two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound business practice . Maybe Lewis was n't so dumb after all . He certainly knew where the duck was going to fall . " <P> " Say , George , I certainly am glad you put it that way , I might have gone around knocking this fellow Lewis . This writing certainly is a queer business , but I want to tell you , and it 's just as sure as God made little apples , the thing that distinguishes our American commonwealth from the pikers and tinhorns in other countries is our Punch . You take a genu-wine , honest-to-God homo Americanibus and there ai n't anything he 's afraid to tackle . Snap and speed are his middle name ! He 'll put her across if he has to ride from hell to breakfast , and believe me I 'm mighty good and sorry for the boob that 's so unlucky as to get in his way , because that poor slob is going to wonder where he was at when old Red Lewis hit town ! Do you suppose we could get old Red into Rotary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a changing world , " said George F. Babbitt wistfully . <P> Golden Horseshoe . The man whose literary killing was of such inflaming interest to George F. Babbitt and Secretary of the Treasury Fred Vinson was in Man hattan last week . He had breezed in from his newly acquired 15-room Tudor man sion on Duluth 's lake front to : <P> Haunt Manhattan 's better taprooms in dismal abstinence ( Lewis , once no mean tosspot , is under strict doctor 's orders not to touch liquor ) .
