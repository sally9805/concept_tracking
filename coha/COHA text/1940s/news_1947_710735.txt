txt Concerned over the possible impact of the upward spiral of food prices upon the city 's expense budget for 1948-49 , Mayor O'Dwyer and his fiscal advisers are about to speed up work on their program for more extensive state aid and the relaxing of constitutional restrictions upon the city 's power to tax real estate and borrow for capital improvements . The program , now being drafted by the Mayor 's three-man Committee on Executive Administration , will be submitted to Governor Dewey and the 1948 Legislature . Because of the rise in food prices and its budgetary impact , it was learned last night , the Mayor is again considering the-feasibility of a rise in fares on municipal transit lines as a means of easing the task of balancing the 1948-49 budget . It is known that he feels that the higher fare issue again must be brought forward if efforts to get the state to loosen the city 's financial shackles prove futile . Unless the upward trend of food prices is halted before budgetmaking time next spring , it will , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases in 1948=49 budget appropriations for wages of city employes as well as for food needed in city hospitals and other municipal institutions . It also will force larger appropriations for the city 's share of welfare activities . Labor organizations representing city employes already have submitted to the Mayor requests for substantial pay rises for 1948-49 , including demands for a 15-cent-an-hour increase and a forty-hour week . They also have asked that cost-of-living pay rises , now totaling about $70,000,000 , be " frozen " into the pay structure . The granting of that demand would mean that the 1948-49 budget would have to make provision for additional city contributions to employe pension funds to match those made by employes . The Mayor and his associates are known to feel that a continuance of present high prices will make it extremely difficult to deny some wage rises to many thousands of city workers in whose cost of living the outlay for food is the outstanding factor . The higher pay demands thus fir made have been referred to Budget Director Thomas J. Patterson for study . In its report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 cents with two rides for 15 cents , the Mayor 's executive committee on administration declared that the proposed fare rise would cover the estimated transit operating deficit of $36,700,000 for the year ending June 30 , 1949 , easing by that amount the burden on the expense budget and making that sum available for other essential budget purposes . The same report estimated that the city 's expense budget of $833 , - 773,312 for 1947-48 , constituting the bulk of the record-breaking total budget of $1,031,961,754 , would have to be increased by about $69,000,000 if the 5-cent fare were continued with transit operating deficits carried as an expense budget item . Mayor O'Dwyer , it is understood , plans to press vigorously for an increase in the city 's power to tax real estate for ordinary budget purposes other than debt service . The State Constitution now limits such taxation to 2 per cent of average assessed valuation for the past five years , or about $322,000 , - 000 . The 1947-48 levy will be for $320,892,133 , only $1,569,048 below the limit . An increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city to tax up to a yield of about $480,000,000 , but this power , if granted by two successive Legislatures and approved by state-wide referendum , would not be available until 1950 . The Mayor and the Board of Estimate , when they rejected in August the proposal for a higher fare referendum on Nov. 4 , indicated that the issue might be raised at some later time . The Mayor and his fiscal advisers now are reported to be planning to bring the question into the limelight again while the 1948 Legislature is in session , but there appears to be little chance that it will be forced to a referendum except as i. last resort . Extraordinary increases in the 1948-49 expense budget because of spiraling costs of food and other commodities may , however , be the factors to force a decision on the fare question . The possibility of a much higher expense budget for 1948-49 also has caused the Mayor 's committee to consider anew the use of special taxing power granted by the 1947 Legislature . The Mayor already has indicatea that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , It has been reported , but without confirmation , that the Legislature will be asked to allow the city to increase its sales tax to 3 per cent to yield an estimated $50,000,000 a year of general fund revenue . The Citizens Budget Commission , in a progress report on its survey of five major city departments , reported that " data accumulated thus far indicate that many appreciable economy and efficiency recommendations " will be made in a final report to the Mayor in December , in time for use in preparing the 1948.49 budget . The commission declared that its survey is " casting a searchlight on fundamental deficiencies in the city 's management which have existed for many decades . " Correction of these deficiencies , the commission declared , " would go a long way in relieving the city of many of its financial difficulties . " The survey , made at the Mayor 's request , covers the Police , Fire , Sanitation , Public Works and Correction Departments .                @ @ @ @ @
