 | If cards hold the slightest fascination for you , can you imagine anything more delightful than to be seated opposite your favorite partner , with congenial companions at your left and right , a cool drink by your elbow , cigarettes at hand , and even a lovely vista on which to rest your eyes when the cards seem a bit baffling ? You have nothing to do but be at ease , sip your drink , make bids , and play your cards as your judgment directs . Not a single penny is at stake , so you all play without worry or care . This pretty little picture , when applied to tournament bridge , is just about as false and misleading as anything could be ; for no one works harder , is under greater mental strain , is more tense and excited , than a contestant at a national tournament . I know , for I have played in many of them . Several times a year the tourn. , - ment players of the United States . literally hundreds of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other foursomes . Nothing but a title is at stake ; vet that title is as dear to every bridge player as the Davis Cup is to the tennis player or the World Series to a ballplayer , and it is competed for just as keenly . There are events for men and women , mixed foursomes , and men foursomes . For the elite of the bridge world ? those who can qualify by reason of points earned by former victories there are the master events for master players . @#  | From 28 to 40 hands , depending on the particular event , are played each session , and sessions are held afternoons and evenings . Not more than 5 or 6 hands are played each hour . So you can see that the playing time is long , and as each event is played over two or more days , what sleep the player gets during tournament week usually occurs only after he 's completely exhausted . Lack of sleep is wearing on the nerves ; but consider , in addition , the feats of memory the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bid made , every card played , and counts out the various distributions of the cards in each of the players ' hands as they are played ; and like a part memorized by an actor , they are not easy to forget . They stay with you . And you alter them , to figure out what might have happened " if . " I find myself often in the position of my fellow lawyers , of whom it has been said that they make three summations to a jury : the first is the one they prepare ; the second is the one actually delivered ; and the third is the one they think of after the trial is over . Even when moving from table to table , you are not relieved of tension . During a recent tournament I was approached by a stunning girl , who asked me how I was doing . I mumbled something about doing all right and continued toward the table at which I was to play . Suddenly , like a flashback in the movies , I realized that the lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she fully understood and forgave . A bridge player really needs a tolerant wife . NOT MANY years ago , bridge tournaments were conducted by the firm hand and commanding voice of a young West Pointer . He was teaching mathematics at the Academy , and his wife drove him to and from the tournaments . ' They had a specially built car , with a bed for him to sleep on , so he would n't be too groggy when he returned to his classes . This young lieutenant became General Mark Clark 's chief of staff during the past war , and he is a major general today . I am , of course , referring to Alfred M. Gruenther , who also found time during his brilliant military career to write a book on duplicate bridge . In 1942 General Gruenther was a member of one of the most famous bridge foursomes in history . He and three other players had completed their preparations for a project in which they were interested . While the project was under way , they decided to engage in a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D. Eisenhower , and their opponents were General Mark Clark and Captain Harry Butcher , Eisenhower 's aide . The project was the invasion of North Africa , and the game was played on board the flagship of Admiral Cunningham of the Royal Navy , in the Mediterranean . It seems that generals are as affected by their bridge conquests as ordinary players are , and like the latter are not above bragging about pleasant results . In one hand , General Clark reached a bid of four clubs , which was doubled by General Gruenther . General Clark made his contract with art - overtrick . So pleased  | was he that he became far less modest about this bridge victory than he subsequently was about his military one . He talked about his bridge triumph all over Africa , Sicily , and Italy . Eventually it became known back in the States . The story came to the attention of General Eisenhower , who is proud of his bridge , and he wrote home . He made sure it was known that it was not he who had doubled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happily have their lighter moments . I recall one in which Dick Frey was my partner . I had opened the bidding with one diamond . My lefthand opponent , Oswald Jacoby , said in a low voice to a passing waiter , " Two Cokes . " " Double , " said Dick with relish . Dick had a good hand , and he was ready and eager to double anything . He had mistaken " two Cokes " for " two clubs . " There was , you may be sure , quite a todo about this one . Charles Goren , who has doubtless won more championships than any other player , was my partner during a national event last summer . He knows all there is to know about the - game , and his dry rumor never deserts him . We had arrived it a contract of three no-trump , through some razzle-dazzle bidding , although neither of us held a stopper in the club suit . Our opponent led the club ten from a sequence of ace , king , queen , jack , ten , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , setting us three tricks . Charlie looked steadily at his opponent and , in the tone of the bridge master he is , said to him witheringly , " Do n't you know that you should lead your fourth highest card of a suit against a no-trump contract ? " HAVE often been asked if luck plays much of a part in winning a major tournament . My answer lies in my favorate anecdote . A long-distance call came me from an important client as I was about to pick up a hand from the duplicate board . I did not want to keep my client waiting , nor could I hold up the clay of some fifty other couples , so I coked around for someone to play my hand while I was gone . Everyone seemed to be busy elsewhere ; that is to say , everyone but my brother Ben . Ben had been kibitzing at my table , and although he is a swell guy , a former Brown University football player , and well thought of in the live-poultry business , he is certainly no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing too terrible would happen . I picked up the cards , and without looking at them , thrust them into Ben 's hand and rushed to the phone , pausing just long enough to tell him not to open his mouth and to be sure to follow suit . My bridge is on the conservative side . When I returned to the table , my partner was smiling broadly . My opponents looked as though they had been robbed of their train fare home . The story was short and sweet . Ben had taken me literally and passed a hand on which everyone else in the room had bid either grand or small slam , but , because of extraordinary 1,000-to-1 lay of the verse cards , had failed to make either them , We received a top score on this board ! Who are these people who come from all over the country to play for bridge championships : who , for a week , will do thing but eat , drink , and sleep bridge ,  | and for whom there is no subject for conversation except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , I mean a few ? are professionals . They teach bridge , write columns for newspapers , and generally look to the game as a means of livelihood . Make no mistake about it , the professional is engaged in hard labor far exceeding the forty- or even fifty-hour week ? and he is not paid for overtime or holiday work . But the great majority of tournament players are business or professional people , who have to make a special effort to arrange their schedules so they can play . For most of them , the tournament . with its rigorous week 's labor , is , oddly enough , either a vacation or added to a business trip . Quite a few Hollywood people exchange klieg lights for bridge lamps for a week of tournament play . and I know a conductor of a famous orchestra who arranges his concert schedules not to conflict with a major bridge tournament . A United States dis . trict judge attends tournaments frequently . Then , invariably , there is the best bridge player of XYZ County or State , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to compete , modestly disclaiming any idea of winning , but secretly sure he is just as good as the better-known players . In a few cases he is . Bridge partnerships are arranged without distinctions of any kind . You can see an industrialist playing with his clerk and not at all immune from a bawlingout . Socialites play with the hoi polloi . I have seen a general with a sergeant as his partner , and the speech of neither was inhibited by his rank . Nor is sex regarded as conferring any special privilege . When a woman and a man play as a team , they do so on equal terms , and are treated and treat each other accordingly . There is a classic story about the fiery-tempered Fred Kaplan . A pretty girl was his partner in a tournament . He had given her specific instructions never to support his bid with fewer than four trumps . On one hand she raised his bid with only three , but these three were the ace , king , and queen . Quite properly she concluded that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four of lesser worth . She had not reckoned with Fred . When she put her cards down , he glared at her and said , " I 'll give you just thirty seconds to produce another trump ! " WHAT makes already successful people submit to a week of painstaking drudgery and hard work ? The tournament holds no financial inducement . either present or future , nor does the fame achieved in winning carry beyond the next tournament . Every mistake a player makes is recorded and shown mathematically in his score . A week of good play can be overcome by a single error . The recent Masters Team of Four competition was won by only 40 points . yet until the last 14 boards were played . the winners were 2,500 points behind . Obviously , many errors occurred during the play to the finish . I do n't profess to know the answer . Every year I solemnly swear . " No more . I 've had enough . Never again will I beat my brains out . Nobody and nothing on earth can persuade me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But every year I go back . I guess I must like it .
