First graders will soon be taught that two plus two makes four-but four airplanes , not four apples . <P> At Columbia University Teachers College last week a group of educators , mindful of an air-minded world and with the blessing of the Civil Aeronautics Administration and the U.S. Office of Education , began work on a manual showing how aviation can be welded into every subject in the curriculum . Under Teachers College 's Professor Nickolaus L. Engelhardt , a staff of research experts was busy assembling lessons from the air : <P> &gt; Spelling classes will learn to spell ( and define ) drag , lift , stratosphere , bomber . <P> &gt; Nature classes will learn that milkweed and dandelions disperse their seeds by means of tiny parachutes ; that a maple seed drops like a helicopter . <P> &gt; Social science classes will learn how aviation is likely to affect cities ( e.g. , make them smaller ) . <P> &gt; Biggest change will be in geography . Pupils will reckon distance not in miles but in flying time , will learn to divide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southern hemispheres . <P> Meanwhile , CAA had launched another school project : the Air Training Cadets of America . Its object : pre-flight training of high-school boys in aviation mathematics , aircraft identification , meteorology , navigation . From this course , CAA hopes eventually to get 2,000,000 Army &; Navy airmen .
