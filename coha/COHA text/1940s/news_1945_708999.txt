txt Lifting of the union charter of the 1,675 strikers on the Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway if they do not return to work by Oct. 17 was threatened today by their international union , it was reported from Detroit . its headquarters . Meanwhile , in Boston , after formally seizing the 900 miles of bus and trolley lines on Governor Tobin 's orders , Frank J. Murray at once issued a statement as Administrator warning the strikers that the system was being operated by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts , and any continuance of the strike must be considered a strike against the State . Mr. Murray urged the men to return immediately , and pledged that as soon as they did , negotiations would begin for a fair and reasonable agreement on wages . Strike Vote Taken First unofficial reports of today 's balloting credited several of the 10 divisions on strike with voting to call off the walkout , and another with voting to defy the Governor 's directions to end the stoppage . Ballots were due to be counted this afternoon at Hotel Manger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike , some service may be resumed late this afternoon . However , normal operations on all lines could not be restored until tomorrow morning . This is the first seizure of its kind in the history of the country , according to veteran union officials . The system ranks among the ten largest in the . United " States , it covers the largest territory of any in New England , and is second in number of employees only to the Boston Elevated . Union leaders generally were unwilling to predict how the vote would go . It was certain that some of the men would not vote to go back to work . But the Governor 's unprecedented move threw such an obstacle in front of the walkout as to make the value of its continuance dubious , as others saw it . The effect of the strike on industry seemed smaller than expected . The River Works of the General Electric Company at West Lynn , employing 16,000 , the largest plant in the strike area as well as in the State , reported everything normal . Absenteeism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Monday morning . " A large number drive , and about everybody got here , " an official said . The same report was made at the company 's West Lynn Works , which now has between 5,000 and 6,000 workers . However , at the big Quincy shipyard , which has a pay roll of 16,000 employees and is working two shifts , a check showed between 8 and 10 per cent of . the morning force absent . The usual absentee rate is 5 per cent . In establishing himself in charge of the Eastern Massachusetts system , Mr. Murray , a former Corporation Counsel of the City of Boston , made his headquarters in the company 's office . He brought in the heads of departments and told them that all routine matters should be handled by the company 's organization the same as before the seizure . But all questions of policy should be referred to him . Mr. Murray added that he would be on the job day and night until further orders . What he would do in case the men refused to return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some union leaders felt that after the Governor took the lines to re-establish service to 550,000 daily riders , he could not permit the system to remain idle . Possibility of his using the State Police to protect any employees who return to work was considered , in case many strikers determined to continue the walkout . , The Governor acted under the wartime emergency powers voted by the Legislature in 1942 . Officials at the State House pointed out today that the 1942 legislation granting the Governor emergency wartime powers provided that anyone violating any order under these powers could be punished by imprisonment ofnot more than one year or by a fine of not more than $500 , or both . In the first verified tally of a division 's vote made public , Lowell voted 97 to 54 to return to work tomorrow morning . The Salem Division of the system , which did not join in the strike with the other 10 Divisions , did not vote today . Since its 125 men continued at work , they had no reason to vote on whether or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes the divisions will have common sense enough to vote to go back to work , " commented one union man today . The men are simply asking a reasonable increase in wages and a proper reduction in hours , Russell Withrow , chairman of of the general conference board of the union , said today . Mr. Withrow , who is president of the Quincy Division , heads up the union 's general organization on the Eastern Massachusetts . Other Cases Cited " Two street railways in this vicinity have received $1.10 an hour , and we feel that is the least we are entitled to , " he said . " One of these companies is in Springfield , Mass. , and one in Connecticut . " We are a much larger company , and more financially stable . We are not asking for any more at the present time than others are getting . " Some of the 11 divisions would decide to return , and others would hold out , according to one estimate . This possibility opened a new question . Would the majority vote on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own , regardless of the majority , as did Salem previously ? Mr. Withrow , the chief union leader , declared that the majority count would decide  --  if there was a majority of one for returning , all would return , or if there was a majority of one for continuing the strike all would stay out . Some others disagreed , feeling that if any division balloted in favor of resuming work , it would do so , even though the majority on the system should vote to continue the strike .
