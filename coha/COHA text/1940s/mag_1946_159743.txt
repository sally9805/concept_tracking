One of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov 's least known operas is Tsar Saltan . A skip-along scherzo in its second act has become one of the inevitable pieces in any violinist 's repertory : Flight of the Bumblebee . Last week Rimsky-Korsakov 's little earsore was a strong jukebox nickel-puller , helped by a steady left-hand beat , and a new name : Bumble Boogie . <P> The man who put it there is short , balding-39-year-old Bandleader Freddy Martin-the man who has made more money from the music of Tchaikovsky and Grieg than the composers did themselves . By last week , Bumble Boogie ( titled by Freddy 's 14-year-old son , who thereby gets a cut in the profits ) had sold a million phonograph records . <P> Five Bars in Helsinki . Freddy himself was only 16 when he committed his first crime against classical music . He and some fellow high-school boys had played their way to Europe on a Cunard liner . Later , in Helsinki , playing at a hotel , they heard that Jean Sibelius would be a dinner guest that night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valse Triste . Sibelius heard five bars of it , and stalked heavily from the room . Says Freddy now : " That 's one reason I 've never attempted to do anything with Sibelius . " <P> Freddy now dates this part of his life as " B.C.-before concerto , " which means before the 1941 Sunday when he heard a broadcast of Toscanini and Vladimir Horowitz , playing Tchaikovsky 's Piano Concerto in B Flat . B.C. includes Freddy 's boyhood , thumping a drum and selling musical instruments . For ten years Freddy Martin 's band played prestige jobs like the Waldorf-Astoria , but never made much money at it . His recording of Tchaikovsky 's Concerto put him into the big time , in the movies and on the air , and shot his income up to about $100,000 a year . ( He now owns two song-publishing firms and three horses . ) <P> Freddy Waters Down . Freddy has been borrowing from Tchaikovsky ever since , and it does n't cost him a cent . He has recorded Nutcracker Suite ( an album of eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sixth ( " Pathtique " ) Symphony , titled Now and Forever , with lyrics ( " So it was fated , two hearts are mated . . . " * ) . He also recorded Grieg and Rachmaninoff piano concertos and last week did Dingbat , the Singing Cat , a dance perversion of Prokofiev 's Peter and the Wolf . Says Freddy admiringly : " Tchaikovsky is the most commercial of all the classic writers . " Martin believes there should be some honor among thieves of classical themes , and thinks it is good of him that he still usually mentions the original composer in titles .
