The U.S. Army 's quiet Chief of Staff , General George Catlett Marshall , 62 , has never wanted to ride out World War II with his boots planted behind a Washington desk . The man Pershing called the finest officer in World War I wants to see some action .

The Journal hinted cryptically : " General Marshall , of course , has come into conflict with powerful interests which would like to eliminate him from the Washington picture . . . .

Waldrop ( whose capital dope is reverently quoted by the Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what appeared to be the ball and ran panting across several vacant lots .

Roosevelt and Churchill . " <P> General Marshall , good friend of Messrs . Roosevelt &; Churchill , refused to make any comment whatsoever .
