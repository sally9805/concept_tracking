White-Harper ( $2 ) . <P> RUSSIAN FAIRY TALES-translated by Norbert Guterman-Pantheon ( $7.50 ) . <P> Over the lonely , intractable , life-giving land , the antagonist and provider , the primitive peasant labors achingly by day . At sundown , with his last strength , he feeds and beds the creatures for whom his concern must always be so much greater than for himself . Then night comes down-night which is even more mysterious than day . By the fire , in warmth and light , the man may rest . But he can not forget the great darkness which is closing in . The forces of the earth , the impulses of growing vegetation , the flow of waters , the sweep of winds , the souls of animals , the souls of men good &; evil , the living , the dead , press in upon him from , the night . He finds relief from their imminence in simple patterns of beauty and dread-and the primitive fairy tale is born . <P> Centuries later , the dryads have died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man seeks escape from pressures of another kind-the weight of desiccating factualism and the steel girders of civilization which he has built around him to shut out the night and the enemy , nature . Then , in his distress , the sophisticated fairy tale is born . <P> These two books exemplify both types of tale . <P> Stuart Little . " When Mrs. Frederick C. Little 's second son was born , everybody noticed that he was not much bigger than a mouse . The truth was . the baby looked very much like a mouse in every way . He was only about two inches high ; and he had a mouse 's sharp nose , a mouse 's tail , a mouse 's whiskers , and the pleasant shy manner of a mouse . Before he was many days old he was not only looking like a mouse but acting like one , too-wearing a gray hat and carrying a small cane . . . . The doctor was delighted with Stuart and said that it was very unusual for an American family to have a mouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pops out of the pocket of his creator , New Yorker writer E. B. White , and begins his adventures . <P> When Mrs. Little lost her ring down the bathtub drain , Mr. Little suggested that they lower Stuart into the drain on a string . Soon Stuart came up with the ring around his neck . " How was it down there ? " asked Mr. Little , who was always curious about places he had never been to . " It was all right , " said Stuart . <P> Stuart used to get up before the rest of the family . " To get to the wash basin , he had to climb a tiny rope ladder which his father had fixed for him . . . . " But he could not turn on the faucet . " So Stuart 's father provided him with a very small , light hammer made of wood ; and Stuart found that by swinging it three times around his head and letting it crash against the handle of the faucet , he could start a thin stream of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> As a result of showing off to the Littles ' cat , Stuart was rolled up in a window shade . The Littles thought he had disappeared down a mousehole ( it was an obsession Mrs. Little had ) . So they got down on all fours " and put their mouths as close as possible to the mousehole . Then they all called : ' Stooooo-art ! ' "
