BOWEN 'S COURT - Elizabeth Bowen - Knopf ( $3.50 ) . Elizabeth Bowen , excruciatingly sensitive novelist , who has stalked many a ghost in the subcellars and skeleton closets of the mind ( The Death of the Heart ; To the North ) , in this book turns from fiction to ponder upon the dead bones of her ancestors . Bowen ' s Court is 1 ) the history of the rise &; fall of the Anglo-Irish gentry , as exemplified in ten generations of Bowens ; 2 ) the story of Novelist Bowen 's passionate attachment to Bowen 's Court , the square , empty , echoing 18th-Century family mansion which " like Flaubert 's ideal book about nothing . . . sustains itself on itself by the inner force of its style " ; 3 ) a bloodstained tapestry of Irish history , from Cromwell 's terror to the Trouble ( 1921 ) . <P> With Cromwell to Cork . The book is also a coolly masochistic self-revelation of Novelist Bowen . " I am ruled , " she says , " by a continuity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of spiritual rootlessness ; and by " the savage and austere light of a burning world , " Author Bowen attempts to explain this rootlessness ( a universal malady ) in local terms of the Bowens and Ireland . <P> Ever since the first alien Bowen muscled his way with Cromwell into County Cork , ten generations of Bowen gentry have had a mania for land . For without land the Protestant Anglo-Irish gentry had nothing . In Catholic Ireland , they were spiritual aliens , " people of the ruins . " <P> Colonel Henry Bowen , the founder of the family fortune , was a half-crazy , atheistic , marauding Welsh adventurer who abandoned his Puritan wife to take part in Cromwell 's invasion of Ireland . <P> When the English invaders divvied up the best Irish lands , Henry settled down on his share , a small estate in the northern part of County Cork . There he established the Bowen dynasty which for 250 years lived defensively on its ingrown clannishness . Those were years of an " intense , centripetal life . . . isolated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space . " <P> The Bowens were immured by the " affair of origin " - by their separateness from the native Catholic Irish who islanded their existence . Outside Bowen 's Court rolled the violent bloody history of Ireland . The Bowens looked the other way . " The structure of the great Anglo-Irish society was raised over a country in martyrdom . To enjoy prosperity " ( and enjoy it most of the Bowens did ) " one had to exclude feeling , or keep it within the prescribed bounds . " <P> Aliens Entirely . But Ireland took its revenge on the alien Bowens . It was a revenge as formless and pervasive as a fog from the bogs . In their isolation the Bowens fell to fighting each other like spiders in a bottle . They fought about careers , buried treasure , inheritances , but mostly about the land . Tired of it all , Elizabeth 's father deserted the land , from which the family had drawn its strength to survive . He became a city lawyer . Bowen 's Court fell into disuse .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
