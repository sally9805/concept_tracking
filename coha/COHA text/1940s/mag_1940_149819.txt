Short , blond , athletic-looking , 21-year-old Burton Griffin works by night in the stock room of Vega 's Burbank ( Calif. ) plant , goes to bed with the dawn . One morning last week young Griffin could n't sleep ; a wild idea chased through his mind . Finally it drove him to put on his clothes , hustle off to the plant to tell his boss . Soon 1,500 questioned employes of Lockheed-Vega voted to put it in practice . The idea : " I got to thinkin ' about Christmas and about all those bombers we 're making for the British . . . . And I got this idea about making them a Christmas present of one of the bombers . " <P> Lockheed Hudson bombers cost $90,000 , take 24,000 man-hours apiece to build . From its 20,000 employes ( average pay : 75 an hour ) Lockheed-Vega solicited voluntary pledges of two or more hours of pay per man , planned to make up the difference itself ( expected to be almost 50% of the cost , despite an estimated 100% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , president of Lockheed , and Courtland S. , president of Vega ) after querying the State Department on procedure : * " We will be very glad to transfer the funds so raised ... to Lord Lothian with the employes ' instructions that the Ambassador use this money toward the purchase of a Lockheed Hudson for the people of England . . . . " <P> Three days before Christmas , at Burbank 's Union Air Terminal , workers will trundle out the plane , done up in cellophane and red ribbons . They will be disappointed if Lord Lothian is not there to see their gift christened The Spirit of Lockheed-Vega with two bottles of champagne ( one for Lockheed , one for Vega ) . <P> <P> *Under the Neutrality Act , implements of war can not be donated directly to a belligerent .
