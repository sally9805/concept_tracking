txt A warning to this country 's European associates in the North Atlantic treaty against any assumption that American military aid could give them any absolute guarantee of safety from invasion was issued today by Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg . The Michigan Senator delivered his admonition from the table of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , of which he is senior Republican member , after James P. Warburg had appealed for public " clarification " of American intentions under the covenant . Mr. Warburg , a former New York banker , asserted that some of the statements of American leaders had led to a feeling among Western Europeans that the United States was prepared not simply to avenge any Soviet attack on them but to meet such an attack instantly and at its source . He specifically mentioned remarks by Dean Acheson , Secretary of State , and Gen. Omar N. Bradley , Army C : ief of Staff . Senator Vandenberg said that he thought it not logical that the Europeans should expect the nisi ing of any modern-day " Maginot Line , " in view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the treaty would involve only $1,130,000,000 for its first year . Neverthel ? sa , he agreed that there had been interpretations in Europe that this country was about to extend a kind and scope of immediate security to which , in his view , it was not and could not be pledged . He emphasized that he , as the Republican foreign policy leader , had given " no commitment whatever " to any kind of military assistance program . He asserted that any program that was provided must be valued for the " potential " force it implied and not for any " force in being . " Discussing Mr. Warburg 's proposal that the Senate , in ratifying the treaty , issue declarations making it clear that the United States was not necessarily committed to stopping any Soviet invasion at the outset , Senator Vandenberg said : " There is a great deal to be said for the importance of eliminating any possible ambiguity . It would be the last possible crime we could commit to let our friends be deceived . They should know that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ View Senator Tom Connally , Democrat , of Texas , committee chairman , strongly rejected Mr. Warburg 's argument that treaty ratification ought to be accompanied by American explanations . The French and other European statesmen who signed the covenant , Mr. Connally asserted , " know what it 's all about already " and were quite aware that the obligation of this country , like that of all the others , was simply to respond to an attack when and how it thought fit . Mr. Warburg replied that ordinarily he believed this would have been clear enough , but he argued that the Aches , on and Bradley statements had made it imperative to spell out what the United States would and would not do . Mr. Warburg , who held official posts during the Roosevelt Administration , testified that without " clarification " the treaty would be so " highly dangerous " a venture that it ought not to be ratified at all . Policy Statement Outlined Supporting a policy only of deterring aggression , Mr. Warburg asked the Senate to adopt a pronouncement that to this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was prepared to fight , if necessary , to maintain European security ; was now serving notice to that effect , and would do its utmost to make it clear that any attempt at European conquest was " foredoomed to failure . " That , " if , in spite of the foregoing deterrents to aggression provided by the United States , an aggressor should nevertheless embark upon military adventure , the United States preserves full freedom of action to fight the aggressor in whatever manner , by whatever means , and in whatever theatre or theatres of action it may seem expedient , in order to restore as rapidly as possible the security and freedom of the North Atlantic area . " Mr. Warburg- supported the treaty , assuming such a " clarification . " It was opposed before the committee during the day by several other witnesses , including James Imbrie , chairman of the Progressive ( Wallace ) party of New Jersey , and the Rev. Dudley H. Burr , representing the People 's party of Connecticut .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
