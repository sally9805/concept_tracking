In Boston 's Federal District Court last week a gaunt , haughty , thin-lipped man stood up to hear his sentence . He was Douglas Chandler , onetime newspaper reporter , American Lord Haw Haw , convicted as a common traitor ( TIME , July 7 ) . The judge gave him one more chance to speak . <P> In the cultivated voice that had once harangued the world over Berlin radio , Chandler read his statement . He had wanted to take the stand " to establish the truth of my beliefs , particularly as to the danger to my country from the conspiracy of world Jewry . My counsel thought me insane , I am not insane . . . . Time , however , will vindicate me . . . . If I must die because I dared speak the truth then let me die . " <P> Said Judge Francis J. Ford coldly : " The defendant . . . is sane . He is a fanatic . Counsel for the Government said he was a snob-I do not adopt the word . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a chance to associate with people that he thought were of some importance . He expected Germany to win the war . What type of sentence shall I impose that will act as a deterrent to others ? " <P> Judge Ford conferred briefly with the court clerk . Then he fined Chicago-born , snobbish Douglas Chandler $10,000 and sentenced him to life imprisonment .
