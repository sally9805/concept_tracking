Sixteen months ago , Clarence K. Streit ( Union Now ) proposed a union of democracies against the Nazi tide . Since then , disunited democracies have collapsed like sand castles . This week , in a full-page advertisement ( " paid for by a group of American citizens " ) appearing in the New York Times , Streit proposed " UNION NOW . . . of the U. S. A. and the Six British Democracies . . . before it is too late . " <P> Among the few courses left to U. S. foreign policy , said Streit , were : to give the British up as lost , thus abandon the U. S. 's first line of defense ; to give all aid short of war , or go to war ( neither of which courses held any insurance that the British fleet would not be surrendered , turned against the U. S. ) . The U. S. , said Streit , must offer Britain the hope that lay in Union Now with the U. S. Union gave the 13 colonies the courage to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ III but Adolf I. " <P> How would Streit 's Union work ? " A provisional Inter-Continental Congress " would be set up " on this side of the Atlantic , ' " composed of 27 representatives from the U. S. , eleven from the United Kingdom , three from Canada , three from Australia , two each from Ireland , Union of South Africa , and New Zealand . This body alone ' would have the power to declare war or peace . " The British Cabinet . . . could no more surrender the naval or other armed forces than the Government of New York can surrender any of the armed forces of the American Union . " The British fleet would be secured against surrender and united with the U.S. fleet to rule the Seven Seas , even though England and Ireland were invaded , crushed . <P> Would the British accept ? Wrote Streit with confidence : " The British consider such a proposition practicable and await only our invitation . "                @ @ @ @ @
