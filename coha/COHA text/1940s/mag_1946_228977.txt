Foster was only mildly pleased with progress on the nation 's strike front . <P> Things were far from hopeless-at a Madison Square Garden rally honoring Vladimir Lenin he pointed out that strikes were being conducted " on a high level , " that the present vast uproar over wages might well get bigger and louder , that corporations were " lousy with money .
