Dr. Milan Grol , Yugoslavia 's Minister of Education , was speaking to 230 educators from 16 countries , convened to add a " Children 's Charter " to the Atlantic Charter . <P> " Before discussing the ideal program of tomorrow , " said Dr. Grol , " we must confront the grave and immediate problem of how to keep thousands of children alive . . . children without parents , children with neither bread nor roof , some mown down by epidemics , others grown slowly blind through starvation . . . . <P> " It was the shooting at Kragujevac . . . that has sown panic throughout our youth . ... To reach the prescribed number of hostages - 2,300 , which was afterwards doubled - they made the children with their books in their hands leave four classrooms of a secondary school , cover their faces before the bullets . They were all machine-gunned . After that massacre , the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forests like wild beasts increased . " <P> So saying , Grol broke down and cried .
