 | To keep your baby cool in summer it is not always necessary to move to the seashore or to the mountains . Of course , it may be advisable to take the baby away from crowded city streets to a place where the air is fresher . But except for this it is probably just as well to keep a young baby at home , where his regimen and feeding schedule will be regular and he can have the comforts of his usual surroundings . Here are some specific things you can do to keep the baby comfortable . 1 . Watch the baby 's food and its preparation , so that he will not be upset . 2 . Give him all the boiled water he wants to drink . Offer the water between feedings . A well child does not to be wakened just for this . 3 . Dress the baby lightly , varying his clothing with the weather . During the heat of the day , a diaper may be the only garment needed . When the baby is placed on a sheet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he may be more comfortable without even that for a while . If the weather is a little cooler , add a sleeveless shirt of cotton or linen or a thin , short slip . When you are outdoors even in summertime , keep at hand a lightweight kimono or sacque , in case the weather changes or a sudden wind blows . At night , in anticipation of a change in temperature , it is usually wise for the baby to wear a lightweight nightgown or sleeveless shirt in addition to the diaper . Then few or no bed coverings will be required . 4 . Beware of prickly heat . If a baby is clothed too warmly , his body may break out in a rash ? a reaction of the sweat glands in the skin . This itches , and if the spots are rubbed or scratched , they easily become infected . A mother can usually prevent a rash of this kind by keeping the baby out of the direct heat of the sun , allowing air to reach all parts of his body , and using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will evaporate . Watch especially the skin around the neck , under the arms , and on the chest . When a rash starts , pat the area with bicarbonate of soda and water paste , or powder it with cornstarch. 5 . Never omit the baby 's daily bath . In summer , he may need two . The skin requires special care , because it plays an important part in the body 's heat-regulating mechanism . If the cleansing bath comes routinely in the morning , add in the late afternoon a quick sponge bath or a dip in a tub of tepid water . Or give the quick sponge in the morning and the longer bath in the late afternoon . During the hottest weather , a salt bath may be refreshing . The proportions for this are a handful of table salt to each gallon of water . 6 . Keep the baby 's skin clean . During the summer the skin may become irritated in the creases between the fat folds . Keep these areas clean and free from perspiration , and apply a light touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact . Pay special attention to the diaper area , as an irritation here can make a baby most uncomfortable . After each diaper change , use oil or powder lightly on the abdomen . Leave diaper off occasionally , so that the skin may be exposed to air . Use rubber or other waterproof material over the diaper as little as possible . Sore buttocks may be caused by something in the food as well as by irritating urine or diapers that have been washed with harsh soap . While a baby should n't lie long in a wet diaper , we do not advise mothers to waken them just to change the diaper ? unless there is some special reason . 7 . Keep the  | nursery air in motion . This can be done by cross-ventilation . Push the baby 's crib out into the room , where the air is fresher , or move the bed at night to a cooler room . No child should sleep in a strong draft or have a wind blowing directly on his head . While an electric fan may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby should not lie in the direct path of the fan . It is all right to leave a fan on during the night if it does not blow directly on the baby and if it is a reliable fan that wo n't break down and perhaps cause a fire ? which has been known to happen . Let the baby sleep in a room alone if possible ; but when another person must share the room , give the baby the advantage of having his bed nearer the window . 8 . Give the baby his daily outing before and after the extreme heat of the day . Keep the child 's eyes turned from direct sun , reflected light , and glare , out of strong wind , and away from blowing dust . Protect him from flies , mosquitoes , and other insects . These pests are not only annoying , but they are dangerous . Flies carry germs , and insects may transmit disease . 9 . Avoid motor trips and air-cooled establishments . Parents often think that they should take a child for a motor ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theatre . There is little advantage in this for young babies . On the contrary , the abrupt change of temperature may be harmful . 10 . Be careful about sunbaths . They should always be begun cautiously , with a short exposure of the child 's body , and the time should be increased slowly from one minute to fifteen or twenty minutes at a time . Watch for the first signs of sun- or windburn . No baby can be cool or comfortable if his skin has reddened . At the first sign of this , let the baby wear a sun hat , cover his body or move him to a shaded place . A soothing cream may be applied to a light sunburn . Or you can pat on a solution of bicarbonate of soda ( 1 teaspoonful to 1 pint of water ) . For more intense reddening of the skin , your doctor may prescribe a healing liquid or ointment . For severe sunburn a doctor should always be consulted as soon as possible . Follow these ten rules for keeping your baby cool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly to your child .
