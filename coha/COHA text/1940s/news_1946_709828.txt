txt For the second time this year , the Security Council of the United Nations has thrown out by an overwhelming majority the Russian charges that Greece and the British troops in Greece endanger international peace and security . In the first case , decided last February , Russia stood so completely alone against all the other Council members that she decided to withdraw the charges and the Council dropped the case . This time , forcing the issue to a vote , Russia was able to rally only her Polish satellite to her side , and the Council turned down by a vote of 9 to 2 both the Russian resolution condemning Greece and Great Britain and a Polish resolution designed to give some substance to the case by keeping it on the Council 's agenda . The vindication of both countries by the supreme organ of world opinion could not be more complete . And the final commentary on the Russian charges was provided by the Russian veto of the American resolution to investigate the situation along the whole Greek frontier . But this new Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger of which is being attested daily by frontier incidents such as have served often enough in the past to precipitate more serious conflicts . There is no doubt that leftist bands in northern Greece are in open revolt against the established Government , and there is reason to suspect , as the Greek Government charges , that these bands are being armed and reinforced from Albania , Yugoslavia and Bulgaria . But only a thorough and impartial investigation could establish the truth of the matter , and that investigation has been blocked by Russia . Under these circumstances one can only welcome the announcement of Secretary General Lie , to which Russia did not object , that he reserves the right to make his own investigation . The Charter provides ' that " the Secretary General may bring to the attention of the Security Council any matter which in his opinion may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security . " Whether this provision was intended to give the Secretary General the right to make any investigation , especially one on which the Council has been unable to agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argued that if the Secretary General is empowered to call to the attention of the Council a matter so grave as to endanger international peace and security he should also have the power to ascertain the facts before doing so . But it must also be assumed that an investigation by the Secretary General is subject to the same Charter provisions as an investigation by the Council ; that is , it must really concern itself with international peace and security and not with " matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state . " It would be salutary to have a real investigation of conditions in all the Balkan states in order to find out just how far the wartime pledges of freedom and democracy are being carried out in them . But if such an investigation should be started , it would be impossible to confine it either to the Balkans or within the Charter . And that would impose on the United Nations a greater burden than it was created for or can bear .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
