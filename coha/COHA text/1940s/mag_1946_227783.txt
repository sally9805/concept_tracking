He might even drop in from time to time at the House of Lords , " where , you know , one has always the right to make a boring speech . " <P> When Halifax was sent to Washington in the early days of 1941 , he accepted a burden which Winston Churchill called " as momentous as any that the monarchy has entrusted to an Englishman in the lifetime of any of us .

" When he leaves , the U.S. will get another topnotch diplomat in his place .
