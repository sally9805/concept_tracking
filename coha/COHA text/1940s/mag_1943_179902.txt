On the flat , swampy farms along the eastern shore of Florida 's Lake Okeechobee , where the rich , black muck sometimes goes as deep as 20 feet , and the long green beans ripen 45 days after planting , the first group of Bahamian Negroes brought to the U.S. in World War II went to work last week . <P> To bring them over from their tropical islands 200 miles out in the Atlantic , the Farm Security Administration set up an air ferry service . The first two groups of 21 , some dressed in dungarees , some in zoot suits , coasted in on Pan-Am Clippers . Then came a batch of 60 in a huge Army transport . Few days later , 76 arrived by boat ; by week 's end 850 Bahamians were on their knees , pushing hampers between the endless rows of bean vines . <P> War has cut off the Bahamas ' tourist trade ; most defense installations are finished . After months of unemployment , a minimum of 30 an hour-the prevailing rate-in the Florida vegetable fields looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting beans , tomatoes and sugar cane harvested , were equally delighted . Ever since last fall they had clamored for permission to import foreign labor . The War Manpower Commission turned them down , fearing a flood of cheap labor , finally okayed the plan . In the Bahamas , the Duke of Windsor did all he could to help . <P> Contracts call for the importation of 6,000 Bahamians ; soon some 10,000 more workers will come from Jamaica .
