As shy as a window washer of a new-style safety belt is the Temporary National Economic ( monopoly ) Committee of advancing technology . Its chairman , Wyoming 's Senator Joe O'Mahoney , is so fnghtened of better machinery that he has introduced a bill in Congress providing tax penalties for any employer who makes a " more than average " use of machinery . <P> Last week TNEC heard why improving technology makes jobs from the No. 1 inheritor of that art : lean , hawk-faced Edsel Ford , president of Ford Motor Co. , Henry 's only son . It was two days after the 28,000,000th Ford had run off the assembly line in Edgewater , N. J. that he sat down before TNEC 's microphone . <P> Two of his points : <P> &gt; Three million men are employed in making , selling and servicing automobiles " because with machinery cars can be produced at prices people can pay . " <P> &gt; Machinery begins to create employment before it ever produces . Example : to build a $115,000 machine for stamping hub caps required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2,160 men , cuts cost of a hub cap from $2.50 handmade to 12 Ford made . If all such technological improvements were eliminated cost of a Ford would top $17,000 , most of Ford 's 125,000 workers would have no jobs .
