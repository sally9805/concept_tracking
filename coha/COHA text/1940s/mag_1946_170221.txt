Somebody in Britain had made skeptical sounds about low U.S. golf scores ( like Byron Nelson 's phenomenal 68.3 average last year ) . The scores were phony , said this Briton , because they were made on easy courses , with the ball teed up on the fairway . No U.S. golfer could say him nay , *but somebody in Britain had to pay for saying it . <P> Britain 's Dick Burton was invited to the U.S. to see whether British golfers could do any better . Burton , a lanky , genial , blue-eyed pro , started explaining as soon as he arrived in the U.S. Said he : " I wish to deny the stories credited to me . . . . " <P> Although he had won the last British Open championship ( in 1939 ) , he cheerfully assured his hosts that there were at least two better golfers in Britain than he . Just 54 hours after getting off the ship , 38-year-old Dick Burton teed off at Boston 's Charles River Country Club in a 36-hole match against Byron Nelson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather was familiar to Britain 's Burton : raw , grey and windy . But that did n't make up for five golfless years in the R.A.F. ground force . When his tee shots were straight and true , his putter was erratic . At the end of 18 holes he was six down . Scores : Nelson 71 , Burton 77 . <P> Next day , the pair moved to Mamaroneck , N.Y. , and dovetailed the second half of their match into the Goodall round-robin tourney . By the twelfth green , Burton was out . In the round-robin , he quickly became isth in a field of 15 . But he got to see some sub-70 performances by U.S. golfers-with no teeing up on the fairways . The lowest : Jug McSpaden 's seven-under-par 65 . <P> * During the war , when courses were in poor shape , most tournaments permitted golfers to improve bad fairway lies .
