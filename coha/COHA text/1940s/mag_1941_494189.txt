THE NEW REPUBLIC Food for War and Peace WITHIN THE PAST TWO YEARS , the big problem of American agriculture has changed from the threat of too much to the threat of too little . Of course , there never really was too much from the standpoint of peoples ' needs , but all through the 1930-40 decade , agriculture struggled with the problem of surpluses : It was true that people were hungry dur ? ing that period . As-many intelligent men pointed out , such a situation did n't make sense . Yet if the American people could n't find a way of using the farm surpluses on hand , there was no reason to raise more simply for the sake of raising more And in the early thirties , the bigger the farm surpluses , the longer the bread lines and the more hunger in the cities . The adjustment in agriculture after 1932 had to be made . The only question was whether the adjustment should be made in an orderly way with the aid of gov ? ernment or in a disorderly way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the Second World War began , farm com ? modities began a brief inflationary dance . People thought about the 40ent cotton , 20-cent hogs and $3 wheat of 1918 and 1919 and rushed out to buy . But before long prices of farm products went down with a thud . The war had sealed our export market &; The blockade cut off most of Europe . The English conserved their dollar exchange for munitions . Live stock products , fruits , cotton and tobacco were particu ? larly hard hit . Hog prices dropped until they were dangerously near the levels of the depression period . Then , along in 1940 , the situation began to change rather rapidly . Our arms program began to function ; the increased industrial activity meant increased pay rolls , and increased pay rolls and an increased demand for farm products are Siamese twin &; The continent of Europe had fallen to the Nazis ; submarines were active and Britain began to depend upon us , not only for munitions , but for food . Sizing up the situation as best I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1940 that I thought it would be a good thing to increase their production of hogs . At that time hogs were selling for about six cents a pound and a lot of disgusted farmers were going out of the hog business . Quite a few people , some pork producers among them , criticized the Agriculture Department for advising farmers to grow more hogs at a time when they were selling at a loss . Nevertheless , farmers took our advice and did raise , i ? , more hogs . The proauction of pigs in 1941 will be slightly more than that of 1940 , instead of 1.0 to is percent less , as seemed likely in the winter of 1940 . And early last spring we began a campaign to increase both pork production and dairy and poultry products . But while we can take credit for foresight , we might as well confess that we ca n't take too much . Looking back , I wonder why we did n't see some things sooner . Frankly , we need more of some foods than we shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have dairy products particularly in mind . For the nation as ; a whole there is a record supply of feed on hand but it takes time to step up milk production . With enough feed available , pork and poultry pro ? duction can be increased very rapidly . A pig is big enough to market in six or seven months , and chickens in less time than that , but a cow must be two years old before she begins producing milk . We can stimulate the production of dairy products in various ways : by feeding more grain than ordi ? narily would be fed , for instance . But , as is the case almost always with extra effort , the cost of the dairy products that we get through heavier feeding will be more than the cost of other milk . And such practices , important as they are , are not to be compared to the increase that comes from fresh cows . Fortunately , our total supply of nutritive foods will be sufficient for ourselves and for Britain too . We may have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporary scarcity of some product &; Last spring , for example , I suggested that we should cut down on our consumption of cheese . Maybe I did n't handle the thing right , for I got an anvil chorus out of my request Some cheese-makers took the attitude that I wanted to cut down on the production of cheese and that I was an enemy of the industry . I tried to ex ? plain and eventually I think I did succeed in getting my point over , which was that there was n't enough milk to supply all the dairy products to fill our own and Brit ? ish needs , and I was suggesting that we divide our cheese with the British workingmen . The original reaction came , in my opinion , from lack of knowledge of the seriousness of the British food situation and the seriousness of the world situation in general . Our people have been complacent , too com ? placent , and they have been a little hard to muse . With every day that passes , however , more people realize what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As soon as the lease-lend bill became law , we began shipping to Britain pork , cheese , eggs and tobacco . Every month since the passage of the lease-lend bill the tonnage of agricultural commodities going to Brit ? ain has increased greatly . The increase was much more rapid than anyone , including the British , had anticipated . It was due perhaps to two things : first , it better shipping situation ; and second , the realization on the part of ourselves and the British of the in'por tance of food in the defense effort . DECEMBER 151 1 9 4 1 Through October 18 , 1941 , we had shipped 887,171 tons of agricultural products to Britain . We had sent more , in fact , than the original schedules called for . The August shipping program of the British Food Mission called for total food shipments of 83,694 tons . The actual August shipments to the United Kingdom , however , totaled 188,946 tons . During August , addi ? tional shipping capacity became available , but some industrial products which were scheduled for shipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can to help them ? selves . They have increased their acreage in plowland 25 percent since 1939 and they are still turning under thousands of acres of their fine pastures . The Canadians are helping all they can Nevertheless , the British must have our food to go on fighting . Not only that , we have made definite promises to the British . We intend to produce the food guaranteed under those commitments and see that it is delivered . One billion dollars of the latest lease-lend appropria ? tion is earmarked for the purchase of food . Almost a third of that billion dollars will go for pork products . In 1942 , we plan to supply the British with about a billion and a half pounds of pork and lard . Another third of the billion will be spent for dairy products and eggs and most of the remainder for vitamin-rich fruit and vegetable products , tobacco and cotton . If we do n't furnish these foodstuffs to Britain , she may have to give up . The British are living now , and have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two of my aides , Paul Appleby , Undersecretary of Agriculture , and R M. Evans , , -. dministrator of the Agricultural Adjustment Admin ? istration , went to England not long ago and remained four , or five weeks . They brought back the story of the dairy farmer who has 200 cows and yet does n't even have milk or- cream on his own table . Almost all of Britain 's milk and cream goes to children and mothers . Evans and Appleby told of seeing one orange . An aviator had it and he exhibited it before he ate it Each had'one egg apiece during their entire stay . They re ? ported that a Cabinet leader told them that British factory production could be increased 15 to 20 percent if the English people had enough meat to eat . And they brought back convincing proof of the shortage of food in their own persons . Evans lost ten pounds during his stay . Appleby lost eight . In Portugal on their way back they got grim re ? ports about conditions on the Continent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nazis are faring bet ? ter than the countries they have occupied . They take what they want . Yet Germany is hungry too . The lack of fats has n't been remedied by all the German victories and is n't likely to be so long as Britain and the United States control the seas . Conditions are growing worse all over Europe . Spain , where starving children plead for food from travelers , 819 has another short wheat crop and recent rains have re ? duced wheat-crop prospects all over Europe . The con ? dition of Greece this winter will be pitiful . Hitler 's dream of consolidating his gains will be futile so long as he ca n't feed the conquered peoples . To the average European , the New Order has come to mean an empty stomach . Freedom from Nazism has come to mean freedom from hunger . The conquered countries are only waiting their opportunity to rise . The people under Nazi domination should know that , once they get rid of Hitler , we are ready to feed them . We must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we need to store up reserves of food , reserves in addition to the food needed for ourselves and Britain . I am hopeful that we will make a good beginning on that task in 1942 . Fortunately , our agricultural plant has a tremendous potential productive capacity . Since 1932 , farmers have argued that the organization set up to reduce produc ? tion could be used even more effectively to increase production . In 1942 , one hundred thousand Triple-A committeemen ? all of them farmers ? will help prove their argument . They will have the help of the other efficient organizations , such as the Extension Service , the Farm Security Administration and other agencies . Since 1932 , farmers have done a lot of soil-conserv ? ing ; they have adopted more efficient farming methods , are using better seed , and our feed supplies are the largest on record . All this will help out , although farm ? ers are going to be faced with some real difficulties in meeting production , requirements for 1942 . This will be due in part to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foods and in part to shortages in such things as skilled labor , fertilizer , farm machinery and operating materials . In 1942 , we are not going to have enough steel and other metals to , go round . Nitrates are needed for both fertilizer and the manufacture of explosives . Copper , which is a necessary part of insect sprays , is a metal which will be short Perhaps the greatest shortage of all will be in the supply of skilled farm labor . Bear in mind that I said skilled labor . I refer to the worker who can and will get up early in the morning to look after the dairy herd or poultry flock , run a tractor and power-driven machinery all , day , do the evening chores and possibly minister to a sick cow or to a farrowing sow in the night . From a lifetime of farming , I know the skill required for this kind of work . The munitions factories prefer the kind of labor which is accustomed to handling farm machin ? ery . They are offering wages far beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fill their quotas in rural areas and already farm labor is becoming very scarce , particularly in those sections of the country where we must look for our greatest increase in the production of pork , poultry and dairy products . By 1943 , however , barring the unexpected , we should be storing up our food reserves in sizable quan ? tities . Some of our folks already are beginning to worry about a surplus of pork and eggs year after next . I 'd worry too if I did not feel that we are going to need all of certain nutritive foods that we can produce . And if I did not feel that we 're going to treat our farmers better than we did during and after the last war , I would worry more . During that war , as you remember , we got down on our knees and begged them to raise everything they could . They did . And after the war they came to us and asked us what to do with the surpluses that were piling up . In effect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " From the standpoint of farmers , that is a brief but pretty accurate statement of what happened . I know because I was farming during and after the First World War . This time , judging from the attitude . Congress has shown , we 'll give both farmers and consumers protec ? tion . For some time to come , we shall need the surpluses of dairy products , meats , poultry products and many fruits and vegetables . We shall need them and so shall the rest of the world . Keep in mind that our own people could use a lot more food , especially the foods rich in proteins , minerals and vitamins . Our increased farm production , however , does not mean increased production of all crops . We want to grow less wheat in 1942 and probably in 1943 . The wheat supply in the United States this year is 1,348 , - 000,000 bushels , which is more than a two years ' supply . Great Britain is getting all the wheat she wants from Canada , which also has huge supplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If we harvest another big wheat crop next year I do n't know where we will store it . Lots of it may have to be piled on the ground . A few months ago I said that cotton was our number-one commodity problem . This year 's cotton crop was short and consumption in this country promises to be more than ten million bales for the cotton year ending August r , 1942 . But do ? mestic consumption of wheat has increased very little and is n't likely to increase much . So now I think the number-one surplus problem is wheat . We need to cut down on the production of wheat , of cotton , of tobacco and of one or two other crops . While there is so much we do need , there 's no reason to waste precious labor , fertilizer and machinery in rais ? ing what we do n't . I am confident that we can and shall increase produc ? tion in an orderly way . Every farmer will have an opportunity to make out a farm plan covering almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall have estimated the national need for farm products and set about systematically to fill that need . I think this type of planning in agriculture will endure , war or no war . Recently , I attended farmer meetings in Salt Lake City , Chicago , New York and Memphis to talk about production goals for next year . Two thousand farm leaders attended these gatherings . They told me farm ? ers were eager to help with defense . They said they did n't want high prices ? they remember what inflation did to them after the last war ? but they did want fair prices and protection against post-war collapse . The public wants farmers to have reasonable prices and protection after the crisis is over . Fair prices are the best guarantee of continued production , and protection for agriculture is one of the requisites if we are to avoid depression after the emergency is over . I am not criticizing anyone when I say that farmers have produced and are producing more abundantly than any other industry . So far as I know , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modity . If we produce as we plan to , there will be little if any rationing in farm products . This comparatively favorable situation is due in no small measure to the Ever Normal Granary program inaugurated by Henry Wallace several years ago . Because of the granary , huge stocks of feed are available for our production effort . Without this feed it would be difficult if not impossible to step up production rapidly . That we can draw upon the raw material out of which food is fashioned is due in large part to the foresight of the Vice President . We have not changed from a program of scarcity to a program of abundance . We have never had a program of scarcity . It is true that people have n't had all they should have had to eat of the vital foods . But that was n't be ? cause the Department of Agriculture and the farmers of the country did n't stand ready to produce the amounts or get the right amounts of vital foods to the people who needed them . We have gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go a lot further and we want our production effort eventually to make an abundance of nutritious food the heritage of every citizen . The people of this country will not tolerate indefi ? nitely a situation in which abundant crops and hunger go together . People ask how we are to bridge this gap . I do n't pretend to know all the answers . Some of the answers I know . They are the school-lunch program , the stamp plan and direct distribution of surplus com ? modities to the needy , programs that have been devel ? oped by the Department of Agriculture . Of course , another answer is to keep up the purchasing power of our consumers . In this connection , if we can put our entire economy to work in wartime , we should be able to put it to work in peacetime too . I know also that the food that we are now produc ? ing will be needed , and badly , when the war is over . The world can always use good food . Tanks , battle ? ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but good nutritious food will never go out of fashion .
