txt By Wireless to THE NEW YORE Thaws . WITH THE AMERICAN FORCES IN FRANCE , June 18 ? American troops who cut the Cherbourg . Peninsula last night spent all today tightening their hold on the western beaches , with a series of bitter little isolated battles with last-ditch German diehards . In-their swift race to the coast yesterday and last night troops of the United States Ninth Division knowingly bypassed many points of enemy resistance . Their advanced ele. ments got to the sea in two prongs a few miles apart in the region of Barneville - sur - Mer , trapping the enemy in between . The job today was " delousing " this area of these hostile pockets and it was a slow , hard , nasty task . These resisters were real Germans and tough . They were surrounded , and they must have known it , but they refused to surrender and had to be forcibly dug out . During the night they infiltrated our lines and through most of today they counter-attacked , usually where least expected . Like Jungle Fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by fanatical snipers who hid in trees and kept picking off our men until tracked and shot down like squirrels . Some came in surrendering , explaining they were out of ammunition . Most of them died . It was more like jungle fighting than anything else . The Germans made skillful use of this rolling terrain , with its woodland clumps , . its little orchards and its deadly hedgerows cutting the ground into tiny irregular patches and giving our enemy the maximum advantages of cover . The Germans planted mortars in hedgerows and , fighting in ad // vance of them with machine guns and pistols , gradually fell back on them as they lobbed shells over on our advancing men . When we got within about 220 yards of the mortar line , it fell back to the next good defensive position . We could seldom see the enemy . He always could see us . Against such opposition , however , Ninth Division elements are cleaning up the town of Barneville on the coastal road and are linking it with our other elements a few miles farther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today that traveling along roads , even well behind our elements , was hard on the nerves . We actually felt safer from snipers in the absolute front line than traveling to and from it . In the front line was the only place where we felt sure where we were and where the enemy was . Being ' naturally cautious , therefore , the front line was where I spent most of my day . There , a unit of the Ninth Division was working arch- ly toward the sea which was tantalizingly in view . It was an engagement typical of the others fought in the last few days of this ' battle of the hedgerows . " The advance d ' - wn the southwest highway from St. Sauveur-leVicomte toward the little seacoast town of Portbail had run into opposition ' - st night outside the hamlet of Canville , just northeast of the coastal highway , which we determined to seize to seal the Germans ' escape route in the sector . IBlocking us was what seemed to be a remnant of the German Seventyseventh Division  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dawn of D-day and had bitterly resisted our progress across the peninsula . Troops Run Out of Ammunition This isathe way wars are fought . Forces of millions are pitted against each other , but each battle is the mosaic of many engagements of small units , fighting deadly little duels . The Germans in the front were hemmed in both north and south by other American forces , but were doing all in their power to cost us time and lives . Our troops felt fairly fresh , for they had caught an hour or two of sleep in the middle of last night . That was because both they and the Germans had run out of ammunition at the same time about midnight . This was after the Americans had tracked down and killed upward of seventy-five Germans , getting many of them with grenades ' thrown into the hedges . At daylight the Americans found they and the Germans had got intermingled in the darkness . In the sorting out there was some more killing with some deaths on our side , too .. A German selfpropelled field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two anti-tank guns on the road . This angered our troops and they took the farmhouse and established a command post alongside it . Cows Milked During Battle A French family was living there . It was milking time , but when papa , mama and their young daughter came out a German gun had scared their cows . The family was annoyed , then , too . With French caution they locked the door behind them and , ignoring the battle , went out to find and milk their cows . Patrols found the Germans had concentrated in and around Canville . We went in a procession of jeeps forward along a winding road to one of the fighting companies to see how things were going . We got out of the jeeps and turned them so we could retreat quickly , if necessary , and squatted down behind a hedge . The base of the hedge was a grassy bank that protected us solidly . Bluebells drooped from this bank and holly grew in the shrubbery above it . An officer walked to a gap and studied the German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he crouched lower . ' There 's a lot of them around , " he explained . " My fellow dropped three from trees this morning but this ' Heiny ' has been at it all day and we ca n't locate him . "
