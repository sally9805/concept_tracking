txt A Picture of the United States In Imminent nerII Of Invasion was conjured by administration leaders as the senate began formal debate today on the New Deal 's compulsory military service bill . The senate is exMeted to devote at least two or three weeks to the first proposal of peace time conscription ill tile history of the republic . Senator Morris Sheppard ill. , Tex. , chairman or the military affairs committee and manager of the bill ; Majority Leader Albert W. Barkley of Kentucky , and Senator Scott W. Lucas 111.1,1 all spoke of the danger o ( an immi-nent attack upon the United States and asked the senate noninterventionists why they had voted for billions upon billions of dollars for armaments if they did not entertain such fears . Stock Administration Reply . This is the stock administration answer to charges that the possibility of an attack upon this country is being exaggerated to foment war hysteria for political purposes . Senator Burton K. Wheeler D. , Mont. , one of the leaders in the fight against peace time conscription , told the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an imminent invasion of the United States they ought to have the political courage to advocate an immediate declaration of war against Germany . As the senate formally began consideration of the conscription bill , there was increasing talk among administration supporters of the probable necessity of a. drastic comproraise before a bill can be passed . The compromise most frequently mentioned by administration supporters is the substitute bill offered by Sen. ator Francis T , Maloney D. , Conn . ) . Proposes to Defer Draft . Whereas the Burke-Wadsworth bill in its pending form subjects the 12,000,000 men between the ages of 21 and 31 to registration and possible induction into service at the will of the President and the war department wants to draft 400,000 by Oct. 1 and another 400,000 next April 1 , Senator Maloney 's bill would postpone the application of conscription until Jan. 1 . In the meantime , the President would be required to issue a proclamation calling for 400,000 volunteers . If by Jan. 1 the number of volunteers should not equal 400,000 , the President would be authorized to draft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be followed with respect to the next batch of 400,000 . Administration leaders privately indicate their willingness to accept the Sella t Or Sil rO1,11 // ALARMISTS OPEN UP WAR ORATORY IN DRAFT DEBATE Conjure Up a Picture of Threatened Invasion . // Maloney substitute . Opposition lead . ers , however , say they will agree to no proposition that would put conscription into effect automatically on Jan. 1 . Suspect Election Strategy . They suspect that a primary pur ? pose of the Maloney proposal is to postpone the application of conscription until after the Presidential and congressional elections in November . They would be willing , they assert , to accept a modification of the Maloney plan that would postpone the effective date of conscrip ? Lion to next April 1 and make its ap ? placation at that time contingent upon approval in some manner by the new congress which will assemble in January . The opposition leaders insist that the next congress , which will be freshly representative of the people after a campaign in which conscription will be a paramount issue , should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate debate , Senator Sheppard declared that compulsion must be added to the existing voluntary enlistment system " to meet an immediate emergency in which the time element is a tragic necessity . " Foresees Growing Emergency . " We want to start 400,000 in training in October , 400,000 in April , and additional increments from time to time of a size demanded by what may be the increasing emergency each year until the bill ceases to operate in 1945 , " Sheppard said . " The doctrines and aggressions of certain dictator controled nations become every day more menacing toward free and independent democratic countries , and the bloody conflicts they have imposed on many such countries outside the United States and are still imposing on those they have not conquered in a crusade which evidently they do not propose to end until all democracy and free . dom shall have been blasted from the earth call for the ' immediate establishment by us of a nucleus ol armed forces in air , on- sea , and on land , properly equipped and capable of expansion , within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States or the western hemisphere . Wants Permanent Policy . " Aside from the existence of pres ? ent dictatorships and the existing world situation , we need a permanent defense policy to protect us against any aggression and from all war until that day shall come , for which we most fervently pray when ' the blast of war 's great organ shall no longer shake the skies . ' " In response to a question by Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg IR. , Mich . , Sheppard said it would be impossible to get 400,000 men under the voluntary enlistment system by Oct. 1 . " I call the attention of the senator to innumerable recruiting stations which have declined to receive recruits because the quotas have been filled , " Senator Vandenberg continued . " With a regular army of 375,000 men authorized and in prospect and a National Guard of 250,000 , which has now been made available , at least so far as senate action is concerned , and the other reserves , we already have a potential total of 750,000 . Cites Lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the President 's national defense advisory commission testify this morning that it will be 1942 before there will be complete equipment for any army of 750,000 men . If it takes until 1942 to equip an army of 750,000 men , and we already have potentially 750,000 men ; why is it necessary to resort to extraordinary peace time methods for additional men ? " Sheppard at first replied that the army would have enough equipment for the conscripts proposed to be called , but when Vandenberg under . took to demonstrate that this would not be possible Sheppard Intimated that the men would be trained without full equipment . " In peace time we will not have 750,000 men , " Sheppard said , without explaining the statement , " and if such an emergency exists that we have to gather men together in larger numbers than we have the equipment or the housing to supply , we will have to do the best we can , as we did during the world war , with temporary housing , and get the equipment in any way we can possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leader Barkley attempted to rescue Sheppard . " Of course , " Barkley said , " they would have to have a certain amount of equipment while they were training , but training does not require the same equipment per man as is involved in the equipment for the regular army , or certainly not for an army which expects to engage in warefare . " Senator John A. Danaher R. , Conn. next engaged Senator Sheppard , and the Texan became piqued . " The senator has told us that there is an immediate emergency which creates a tragic necessity for conscription of American youth , " Danaher said . " Will the senator tell us whether or not there was any evidence ( before the senate committee on military affairs of what the nature of the immediate emergency is ? " " We do not have to have any evidence , " Sheppard snapped , his face turning red . " I know that myself , and I think everybody in the United States knows it . It is this onslaught of dictatorial powers against democracy thruout the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know technically and specifically just what emergency is confronting the country , Sheppard replied : " Right now , in the islands adjacent to the United States , Germany has announced her claim to them because France owns them . " Senator Robert A. Taft IR. , 0.1 told Sheppard he was entirely mistaken and asked whether he could produce any such statement made by Germany . " I think I can , by implication , any . way , " Sheppard said . Danaher , resuming , asked Sheppard whether there was any evidence as to the number of men " it would take to establish a beachhead , a land . ing , in the event that our navy is attempting to repel an invasion . " Sheppard replied that the Germans would not need to establish a beachhead on the American coast If they obtained a base nearby . When Danaher wanted to know what the United States fleet would ' be doing , Sheppard advanced the possibility of an attack by Japan on British Maylaysia and the Dutch East Indies as another rea son for adoption of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is needed now in the Pacific ocean , where an attack is al , ready imminent from Japan , " he said . " Within the past few days , Japan has made assertions , thru her military department , that she is about to assert claim to the tin and rubber in Malaysia . That would be a very serious Injury to the United States . " " Does the senator consider the United States navy adequate for our defense ? " Danaher inquired . " I do not , " said Sheppard . " Does the senator think that our navy will be required to be kept in the South Sea Islands and those waters ? " " I am afraid it will . " " Then we need all the ships we have in our navy ? " " We need twice as many . " " We can not spare even 50 , can we ? " Danaher concluded , referring to the Roosevelt administration 's project to release 50 destroyers to Great Britain . Sheppard did not answer . this world today , so far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Lucas said . Danaher said he voted for the billions for defense because President Roosevelt had spent 6 or 7 billion dollars on the army and navy and left the country in a hopeless state of unpreparedness , and had incurred the hostility of other nations by repeatedly making threatening and warlike statements about them . Wheeler Replies to Lucas . Senator Wheeler , replying to Lucas and the other New Dealers , said : " I am one of those who voted for these billions of dollars . I voted for them because the President said it was necessary that we should have these defenses and because I am not In a position to know specifically just what Is needed as a defense . " But I wish to say to the senator , if he will permit me , that I did not vote for them because of the fact that I was afraid that Mr. Hitler or Mr. Mussolini or the Japanese government was going to come over here and take over the United States of America . " If I believed that , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he felt that Germany was going to attack us , then I would not simply vote for these appropriations , and I would not simply vote to call out men for training or to conscript them . I would vote for a declaration of war , because if the fact is that if England is defeated we are going to be attacked by Germany , then of course we ought to vote for a declaration of war . " Those who stand on the senate floor and are so afraid that Germany , is going to come over here and attack us tomorrow , or the next day , or in the next three months  --  why do they not have the courage to go to the people of the country and say , Let 's vote for a declaration of Lucas Asks a question . Senator Lucas then asked Danaher whether he believed the United States was in danger of attack and why , if he did not believe so , he voted for billions upon billions of dollars for the army and the navy . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can ques . Lion the senator from Texas and other ' senators here from now on till doomsday , but he is not going to convince very many people in America that there is no real danger or threat in war ?
