txt Training for Deferred Groups There is an overwhelming percentage of draft age men who , because of dependents , are being classified in group 3A . I suggest that each local draft board , before classifying a man in 3A , should ask him if he would be willing to report for partial training two or three nights a week at a near-by training center . I am sure the prospective draftee would answer in the affirmative in every case . I would set up in all armories training centers where these men could report for instruction in the workings and technicalities of the Army . They could be trained in the use of rifles , machine guns , field guns , radio and almost every branch of the service , and , as the National Guard used to do , could be sent to camp for two weeks in the Summer . Many retired men like myself would be only too willing to donate their services as instructors . HERMAN BIEBER . New York , March 31 , 1941.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
