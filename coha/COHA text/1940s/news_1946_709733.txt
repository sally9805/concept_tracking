txt PARIS , Aug. ** onslaught of the Soviet bloc against the West and in favor of their friends at the Peace Conference has reached the point where it was decided today in the United States delegation that Secretary of State James F. Byrnes must answer . It is believed that the British have reached a similar conclusion . For three days in succession the Eastern group has had a positive field day , with the Soviet seeking to demonstrate to the defeated nations and the world that it pays to have the Soviet Union as a friend and it does not pay to have the United States and Britain as friends . This was shown when Soviet // Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Y. Vishinsky asked for a discussion on the Italian treaty and Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav M. Molotov used it to start a campaign to win Italy away from the West .

Joao Neves da Fentoura , the Brazilian Foreign Minister , can be expected to champion Italy . Mr. Molotov and Mr. Vishinsky doubtlessly will reply for the Soviet Union and all in all it will be the most important ( debate yet held . Unfortunately this had not been foreseen and there is nothing yet on the agenda except to hear the enemy states .
