txt Sales of fur coats collapsed right after the 20% Federal excise tax on them went into effect last April . That was expected . In the following four months , stores did about half the business of the like period in 1943 . They looked forward to a fall spurt to bring them out of this rut . It has n't come . September and October business has been well under last year . A check with retailers in four big cities tells the story Chicago department stores report sharp declines from a year ago  --  down 35 , i- in September . about 40 ' , in October These figures compare with decreases of 90 " , in July , 60 ' , in August . One Detroit retailer , telling of current buc  --  iess 40 , behind ! 1st - ear . said his fur sales figures " are not the kind one likes to look at any time of the year . " One New.York store finds fur sales 50 ; under last year : another notes September volume 300 , under 1943 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year ago . A resident buyer here  --  purchasing for stores all over the country- estimates sales generally at 40 " , under last year . Repercussions Throughout Industry The result of this consumer resistance has been felt throughout the whole industry Manufacturers hat e laid off workers , although not as many as they 'd like for fear of losing skilled employes . Dealers ot fur pelts have increasingly large stocks on hand : they 've been cutting their purchases at fur auctions . An obscrt er at the St. Louis market . where many a pelt is auctioned , described the situation es " demoralized . " A New York auctioneer termed the market " disrupted ? ? Pelt prices hat e been declining . They now arc 10 ' . - to 30 " , under wartime peaks . Fur pelt collectors , like the Hudson 's Bay Co. , have substantial quantities on hand at a time when the new trapping season is about to start . Almost everyone in the for inthr.ry is somewhat confused about reasons for the slump . They point to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . before April . They blame the weather . saying a cold spell is needed They argue that advertising has been insufficient ; in nine big cities retail fur advertising for September was 17,1- under last year Sales Hit Record $500 Million in 1943 Some statisticians pun out figures showing that last year retail fur sales hit a record $500 million , on top of the $360 million total of the year before . They suggest that the public may be " overbought . " A Los Angeles retailer said fur-trimmed , and medium-priced utility fur garments have slowed down because of the tax , but people are buying distinctly luxury goods , including high-priced furs , despite the tax . A. check with representative retailers shows that jewelry , a major luxury classification , has not suffered from its 20% tax . Sales generally are continuing well above a year ago . One New York department store , for instance , is selling luxury jewelry 100e'e above last year 's rate . A .. 1 , os Angeles firm 's jewelry sales are up from 1943 . Chicago stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A Detroit jeweler reported a drop in his sales of from 10 , - ; - to but a perfume retailer in that city said the tax has n't hindered his sales and he is worried about handling the Christmas rush . The fur trade has several theories about fundamental differences between jewelry and fur coats , howeNer . Says Fur Coats Are Not a Luxury Fur coats , they argue , are not a luxury as are diamond rings and pearl necklaces . Less than 10,1- of coats sold are made of the topbracket skins  --  silver foxes , minks and sables . The rest are in medium and low-priced brackets , and it is in these furs that the biggest slump has occurred , representatives of the trade says . They point nut for example that in recent Lampson , Fraser &; Huth fur auctions in New York . buyers took nearly all of a large offering of Russian ail% er foxes . Women are value-conscious about fur coats but not about jewelry , according to another theory . They 'll willingly pay $100 tax on $500 ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual value is hard to pin down . But , say the fur men they wo n't buy $500 worth of fur coat if they have to toss in fanother $100 that will be no help in keeping out the cold Adding weight to this theory is the Chicago department store which reported drastic fur sale declines but has had corresponding increases in sales of cloth coats Buying of fur coats can be postponed , too . the trade points out Restyling. cleaning and repairing will make a nearly-new coat out of an old one , and the remodeling business is booming . If a woman can make her present fur coat last a v1/4 hile longer , she may not have to buy a new one until the tax goes off . Decline in August " Sales " Decline in August fur promotions could account for a little of the full business slump this year Some fur men point out that August fur - sales. " which traditionally start oft ' the fall shopping season , have been going out of vogue for several years . One trade spokesman , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's Itgainst logic , he insists , for a store to hold a ' sale at the beginning of the season , when it has fresh , complete stocks . Furthermore , he , says , August . " salcs " neNer offered much in ' the way of price reductions and have in ! creasingly embarrassed retailers . The United States produces about 40 , ; . of its own furs . Imports the other 60 , -c . Today . ' Russia . Australasia . and Africa arc the big foreign producers , although before the war China and Europe ranked with Russia in importance . Pelts accumulate in the various countries  --  and this country ? at local trading posts or general stores in small communities . Collectors gather up the furs at these points and either sell to larger collectors who handle ex ? port or do their own exporting . Brokers Move the Skins Brokers enter the picture to move raw skins from collectors to dealers . They operate on commission , earn their fees by representing a collector and selling to a dealer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dealer and buying from collectors . Brokers also provide expert Judgment on fur values and the quality of pelts. - The dealer buys for cash , sells to the manufacturers on credit . He specializes in a few kinds of furs and tries to build a reputation for doing business in that limited field . The manufacturer  --  invariably a small businessman with limited resources  --  special . izes , ton By the time he has lined up matchers , cutters and machine operators to handle one or two kinds of fur ire has hired all the labor he can afford . These workers are always specialists . A matcher , for instance , may be expert at picking 12 Persian lamb skins that have curls enough alike to appear as one skin when sewed together out of 100 skins spread on a table , but the same man would he lost at a table of mink pelts . In the same way , a cutter might square off the lamb skins to fit together smoothly and yet ruin mink skins if he tried to cut them . A large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , listed on the New York Stock Exchange . Hollander is a fur dresser and dyer . All furs have to be dressed in order to clean them , kill off bacteria which I would eat the pelts , and soften the skin so I it can be sewn and worn . Lots of them must be dN ed because they are n't very attractive in their natural colors . Either dealer or manufacturer sends the skins to a fur dresser , depending on the contract . Si p Curtails Orders Result of the current sales slump has been that retailers , with stocks on their racks that do n't move , have curtailed orders to manufacturers Manufacturers have stopped buying trom dealers , and dealers have quit ordering from the collectors who are caught with a lot of pelts . Furthermore , transports lion from foreign countries has become much easier and last year 's muskrat " crop " was one of the largest in recent years . Dealers have been caught , too , but from a different source . They bought furs last Near before O.P.A. got around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . dealers here off the deep end . One company paid $11 for raccoon trimmings only to find a ceiling later of $6 . Similarly they paid $1 10 for opossum skins . got a ceiling of 87/S cents , paid $2.80 for northern muskrat , against $2 45 and $12 for red fox against a $ i.10 ceiling . O P A. provides another headache by restricting dealers to price lines handled in a base period . When market conditions change . some dealers are almost forced out of business . Falling pelt prices have carried through to a limited extent to decreases in fur coat prices ? though the decrease on the finished garment is never as high as the drop in raw fur prices because of fixed manufacturing costs and fixed retail markups . Muskrat is the most popular fur , in point of dollar volume , and rabbit , in terms of unit volume . Persian lamb coats sell best in the medium-priced field and mink reigns in the over $1,000 class .
