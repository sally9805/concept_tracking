book deserves comment . Lou- Jise Bogan , the well-known poet and critic who died at age 72 in 1970 , never completed what in conventional terms could be called an The Nation . have become the national equivalent of dog turds on the sidewalk . We have to skip around them to deal effectively with the problem . Protection for both whistle blowers and the mass of other people the whistle blowers seek to protect may turn out to be more effectively found in rejuvenated labor unions , consumer co-ops and other kinds of mass-based voluntary organizations that do n't have to resort to the law courts but can apply autobiography . " Mosaic " is an apt word , for this assemblage by Ruth Limmer , Bogan 's literary executor , of widely disparate writings of a personal bent  --  journals and notebooks , short stories , articles , letters and poems ( including a few not before published ) . In Liinmer 's imaginative but unobtrusive arrangement , these fragments fuse in a greater unity than one would have thought possible . Gaps , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full self-portrait but a revealing sketch for one . As a much-anthologized poet and The New Yorker 's regular reviewer of verse , Bogan could have sought the public eye as assiduously as some of her contemporaries ? Edna St. Vincent Mil-lay , for example . Privacy remained her passion , however ; she met life with the wariness of one who was her own sole protector . Given her intense reticence and the traumatic quality of the past that was hers to remember , it is remarkable ? that she got as much on paper as she did . As a record of events , the book is by no means sunny reading . Although Bogan had that talent often observed in Irish lapsed Catholics for taking things hard , much that happened to her would have been hard on anyone . Her greatly loved elder brother was killed in World War I. She had two bad marriages . The first , briefer one was to an army officer whom she wedded at 19 in a spirit of rebellious escape , and with whom it soon became apparent she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more emotionally destructive , was to Raymond Holden , a now-forgotten lyric poet whose talent did not begin to approach hers . She lived December 27 , 1980 through phases of near-alcoholism , and was hospitalized several times for , psychic strain . As with most writers , she struggled during her life to stay solvent , and often found it a losing battle . In her last years she wrote little verse and found it harder to withstand , even with the help of drugs , the waves of depression that increasingly engulfed her . Some of these agonies come clear only in Limmer 's introduction and table of chronology . Except for a tense account of the breakup of her marriage to Holden , Bogan 's treatment of cheerless adult experiences is oblique and elliptical . What she writes of more amply is the unhappy childhood that lay behind and no doubt determined some of these later events . It was those earliest wounds  --  which people may at length grow used to , but can never in a lifetime outgrow  --  that she felt compelled to uncover . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally break away from each other ; the household ' as a place of continual strife . " I must have experienced violence from birth , " she writes . " But I remember it , at first , as only bound up with flight . " She sets down a typical scene : It is in lamplight , with strong shadows , and an open trunk is the center of it . The curved lid of the trunk is thrown back , and my mother is bending over the trunk , and packing things into it . She is crying and she screams . My father , somewhere in the shadows , groans as though he has been hurt . . . . And then my mother sweeps ' me into her arms and carries me out of the room . Separations were followed by reconciliations , equally doomed . The child effaced as much of this as she could from consciousness : once , for two days , she went blind . " I remember my sight coming back , by seeing the flat forked light of the gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside the bureau . What had I seen ? I shall never know . " The father remains a dim figure , always , dogged in his attempt to live with a woman he could not understand . From scattered details one gets a vivid impression of the mother 's volatile character , her beauty and recklessness , her alternate fits of boredom with domesticity and of guilty conscience Robert B.

December 27 , 1980 Which brought her home from bouts of infidelity . From childhood on , Bogan 's feelings about her mother were hopelessly ambivalent . Contradictions bristle forth when she attempts to write about her . - I never truly feared her . Her tenderness was the other side of her terror . Perhaps , by this time , I had already become what I was for half my life : the semblance of a girl , in which some desires and illusions had been early assassinated : shot dead . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one major reason for the memoir 's remaining unfinished . She was too scrupulous to fool herself into believing that she could adequately explain them . And even if she had been able , it seems unlikely that she would have cared to document their misfortunes in a clinical fashion . She had little liking for the confessional style in poetry that was coming into vogue late in her career . " The poet represses the outright narrative of his life . He absorbs it , along with life itself . The repressed becomes the poem . Actually , I have written down my experience in the closest detail . But the rough and vulgar facts are not there . " As it is in her poetry , so it is here , in the best of her prose . Facts , whether beautiful or terrible , are not flatly denoted but powerfully intimated in Bogan 's rendering of the landscapes and interiors of her childhood : the depressed New England mill towns and the seedy neighborhoods in Boston where she grew up . Her sharpness of eye and fineness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the small town in Massachusetts where the family lived from her seventh through her twelfth year . She describes the weather of the place , the autumn days when " half the town would lie in the shadow of a long cloud and half the town would stand shining bright , the weather vanes almost as still in a strong blast coming from one quarter as in no wind at all , the paint sparkling on the clapboards . " She writes with affection and longing of her neighbor Mrs. Gardner 's household , where , in flight from the strain and instability of her own , she first discovered " the beauty of a spare but planned life , in which everything was used . " With fervor and a wealth of detail , she catalogues the everyday objects of this house : the piano , the painted china , the " silver card-receiver on the table in the hall . " One comes to feel that she is not merely indulging in The Nation . comfortable nostalgia but re-creating a vision of order that was to express itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered and complete " ? it was with this kind of New England thrift that she ordered the lineaments of her poems , few of which go beyond a page , most of which give an impression of amplitude surprisingly at odds with their - brevity . When she learned to read , comparatively late , it seemed to her that " the door had opened , and I had begun to be free . " She remembers : The stove in the dining room stood out from the wall , and behind it , on the floor , with an old imitation astrakhan cape of my mother 's beneath me ( as a rug to discourage drafts ) , I began to read everything in the house . . . . The coal in the stove burns steadily , behind the mica door ; I remember the feel of the ingrain carpet against the palms of my hands , and the grain of the covers of the books , the softness of the woolen cape against my knees . Later , she notes , her escape was completed as she began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston : I began to write verse from about fourteen on . The life-saving proceis then began . By the age of 18 I had a thick pile of manuscript , in a drawer in the dining room  --  and had learned every essential of my trade . " She did not Like books with no weather in them . Or paintings in which the objects cast no shadows , " Bogan writes of herself in a stray note . No observant reader of this book or of her poetry needs to be told this . She loved to chronicle changes in light ; in the poems the shadow is an image of transience , a token of mortality and of the inward and outward obscurities that attend our lives . It could be said that she remains partly in shadow throughout this book , But the image serves to suggest something more than tragic foreboding : a depth and substantiality , we might say , without which existence would be impoverished .

Her habit in letters was to keep her troubles in the background . This new volume , austere and fragmentary though it is , deepens the reader 's sense of her character by sounding its more somber notes . It make 's evident the vulnerabilities with which she struggled and which she successfully 712 transformed to strengths in her art .

" But like the young of the 1960s , I lived through the period ; indeed , I had a daughter who dwelled in close proximity to an accomplished bass player for a number of rock ensembles . I watched his agonizing three-steps-forward and two-steps-backward progress , the breakup of one band and the instantaneous regrouping for another . I listened to the two talk , and was the grateful recipient of an early subscription to Rolling Stone . One midnight , at the invitation of the bass player , I even found myself at the back of Max 's Kansas City , shut in by windowless black walls , a light show and bombardment of unremitting sound and beat that , after two hours , drove me out into the lower Park Avenue night .

As she said , having received an honor for her writing late in her life , " Not bad for the little Irish girl from Roxbury . " Not bad at all . ? its charged and drug-heightened visions , I can at least recognize the fine-honed authenticity in the fictional world John Eskow creates in Smokestack Lightning . Rarely has a first novel taken such a large and , on the whole , successful step away from the customary confessional mode of such books into the maturity of subject matter and style this one displays . Eskow describes the lives of four rock musicians . They are all close to 30 , not the boys of the radical , grassy 1960s we have come to associate with rock , but survivors who have made it to " the cusp of the 1980s . " They form a group called Cakewalk . Paul Baker is a single-minded , silent , dedicated bass player whose mother runs a grocery store for summer visitors in the Hamptons ; Jimmy Caine , singer and part-time high school English teacher , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mikey Martelli , drummer , is the neighborhood street boy who is making good and married to Carla , who has a job she enjoys as a cab dispatcher , and Alan Landreaux , child of suburban affluence , " a speed freak , at 18 already a veteran of a dozen bands , " who is now , at almost 30 , the uncaring resident of a broken-down East Village hovel . He plays the guitar , lives in a haze of drugs , alcohol and absolute devotion to his December 27 , 1980 music and his girl Karen , who is preparing to be a stand-up comedian . Add to the performers 011ie , their bodyguard , driver , caretaker , instrument hauler and loyal supporter . Cakewalk is ready to disband when Caine makes " a contact " that saves it and sends it forward almost into success ( or at least preserves it from the fate of the bins , the $1.99 last-ditch stand of the one album most small-time bands make ) . The most vivid sections of ther novel are about the year Cakewalk moves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a series of agonizing performances on its way to near fame . These scenes are so blatantly , exactly real that the pages seem to ache with the nastiness , the pettiness , the violence and cruelty of audiences and fellow groups , the funk of rank halls , cheap food , motels , drink and omnipresent drugs . Hovering over the promised success for the band is the novel 's somewhat melodramatic plot : Landreaux discovers that the head of a record company has been bootlegging tapes . He blackmails him in his avidity for the group 's success . The executive 's revenge is to have the suspicious 011ie murdered and then to separate half-mad Landreaux , the heart and soul and head and shoulders of the group , from Cakewalk . Cut away from the spirit and genius among them , the rest of the group , plus a substitute for Landreaux , achieve a great , mindless success : money , mansions , cars . Meanwhile , Landreaux , the novel 's delicate child , the true-to-hissacred-art musician , regroups and starts a new , honky-tonk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the inspired guitarist faithful to his crazy , vision , starting all over again . Landreaux is the pure hero as failure , the crazy Rock Saint ; Caine , the successful corrupted hero . The obvious moral of the tale is not its strength , nor is the rather awkward , seemingly unnecessary blackmail-and-vengeance plot . Eskow is quite wonderful with the language of the rock-music world : he uses it abunt dantly and inventively as he builds scenes of rock life . He is less skillful with events he deems necessary to the plot : the circumstances surrounding Doris Grumbach is former literary editor of The New Republic and the author of Chamber Music ( Dutton ) . Her next novel , The Missing Person , will be published by Putnam 's this spring .
