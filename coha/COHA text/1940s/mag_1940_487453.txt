THE most dangerous word now assailing our minds , in my opinion , is the word " inevitable . " It is more dangerous than the word " fascism , " than " war , " than the lesser words that represent evil to our generation , like " lower standard of life , " insecu  --  rity , " " inflation . " The words we recognize as evil rally in us some degree of opposition , and we translate our opposition into thought and action according to our light and strength . But we have not been taught to classify " inevitable " among the evil words . Part of our light and strength lies in our sense that effort is worth expending . The mind which begins with a conviction of its own futility is like a motor empty of fuel . And that is what makes the word " inevitable " dangerous . It represents defeat before the expenditure of effort , before the acceptance of sacrifice . I am concerned ' about the introduction of this word " inevitable " into a discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the working of inscrutable and inevitable forces so vast that the individual , either by his own contribution or through concerted action with other individuals , is unable to affect those forces . We are told that a world revolution is in progress , and we are expected to be so impressed by the magnitude of the concept that we resign ourselves to inaction . We are ad  --  vised to believe that the inscrutable forces are better for us than any brave self-conducted behavior we may rally against the evils we see . We are told that what is coming is inevitable , and that it is good . Americans are being advised to consider themselves exempted from the conflict in the world on the ground that bigger forces are at work than we know or can affect , that these are . so-called " good " forces , even though superficially they look " evil . " Let us examine the thesis , first to scrutinize the state  --  ment that a world revolution is in progress , next that it is bound to end well . Translated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Nazi movement is revolutionary . When this is said one is supposed to respond not only with a feeling that it is somethingdeep , but that it also is something fundamentally liber  --  ating . For the revolutions of history have been liberating in their ultimate effect . A political or economic revolution is one in which power passes from a smaller to a larger group , and so gives more people freedom . If the power passes from a larger to a smaller group , it is called a counter-revolu  --  tion . These are elementary definitions , and they would be sufficient if social behavior always developed in an elementary way . It is true , the coming to power of the Nazis was revo  --  lutionary to a limited extent . The Weimar Republic had not been thoroughly revolutionary , at least not enough so to clinch the transfer of power from the aristocracy and upper middle dass to the broad basis of labor and peasants . The National Socialist Party was recruited largely from the lower middle classes , with a sprinkling of industrialists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state . But the appearance was deceptive . Hitler did not rule for the benefit of his followers . They did not become suddenly more free . He exercised the power which he had seized through the lower middle class for something other than its libera  --  tion . He applied it to the construction of a military ma  --  chine . He instituted the greatest short-term public-works project of all history . Obviously this solved the imme  --  diate economic problem of giving work and wages to the unemployed . But this was the measure of the eco  --  nomic freedom created . Even this measure of liberation was small , since a great public-works program which was not creating permanent wealth could not be of lasting economic benefit . Even without war , building a war machine is regressive in its effect , and brings a lowering of the standard of life . It does not represent expanding freedom . The net economic benefit of the Nazi revolu  --  tion to individuals in the German state was the employ  --  ment of the unemployed , on whose behalf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accept a reduced standard of living . If the revolution was only economic , only to be thought of in terms of job security , employ  --  ment , and a well-established standard of living , it was a fraud . And from that standpoint to argue that the Nazi revolution promises vast benefit to the world , over which it is sweeping with new concepts of liberation , is palpable nonsense . There is nothing revolutionary in the construction of a war machine . Those who attribute to the Nazi regime the aura of revolution are ignorant of the regime or of revolution , or of both . Certainly there beceinber 21 , 1940 is nothing good , and hence inevitable , in the Nazi eco  --  nomic pattern:It offers to the world no freedom which we should be wise to introduce into our own economy . But a revolution may bring economic hardship for a time and yet promise economic liberation later on , and it is not enough to dismiss the present inadequacy of Nazi policy without a look at its potentialities . If the Nazis intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hoped to promote prosperity by building more and more war equipment , we should not need to look farther . The revolutionary promise would be a hoax for the German public . In time they would discover it and relieve themselves of the perpetrators of the hoax . But the Nazis ask to be taken more seriously . They are not going to stop with building a military machine ; they are intent on using the machine to conquer the raw materials of the world and dominate its production and markets . And though the unemployed so far have been the only ones to benefit by Nazi economics , the Nazis promise that in the future the benefits will be enormous and will be shared by all Germans . They will accomplish this , not by establishing an economic system in which the world as a whole is to prosper , but by establishing a permanent world inequality , with Germans owning or controlling the tools of production , which are to be used by non-owning workers , in other words , by a vast class which is never to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the promise . I am not saying it is a cred  --  ible promise . It has been made by men who have yet to * show ability to master anything other than a war econ  --  omy in a police state , and who have not even tackled the job of creating wealth in their own country . Whether they can dominate and make function a nest of nations , and keep them harmoniously producing for German benefit , is , to put it mildly , highly questionable . It presupposes something more than a police state ; it presupposes a world police empire , and it is a rash assumption that men can be cowed into producing raw materials and manufac  --  tures by spies , concentration camps , and machine-guns . But that is not the aspect of the problem to examine now . The question is : Is this revolution , and if it is , is it revolution to which the world should resign itself in hopeful anticipation ? By the definition I have given of revolution , a transfer of power from a smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this dream of empire would be revolutionary . If all ' Germans were elevated to the ruling class , and if the control of all the world 's tools of production and all its resources were to be vested in them , and if this nation of rulers were to dominate the remainder of the world as inferior , this would be a revolutionary exten  --  sion of power to those Germans who have little or no power today . And Nazis , with their dream of world domination in mind , may be quite sincere when they 628 Revolution being the transfer of power from a smaller to a larger group , and power being more than the control of economic factors , one sees that most of the German people have lost some of their power . They are denied practical control of national affairs ; they may not freely write , advocate , or worship , and their persons are not sacred in courts of justice . This power was theirs , but it has now passed from the many to the few . In these respects German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the word " inevitable . " Part of the concept of that word derives from the sense that , what  --  ever its immediate appearance , the so-called Nazi revo  --  lution is going to do more good than evil . By this state  --  ment is not meant that Nazism is like a fire burning the slums of modern life . Those who tell us it is for the ultimate good affirm that there is inherent revolutionary liberation in Nazi ideas . They affirm that the ideas are liberating Germans and , through Germans , will liberate all mankind . They admire the organization of the Nazi state . They delight in the efficiency of the Nazi war ma  --  chine . They are fascinated by the flight of Nazi imagina  --  tion in taking charge of the whole world . But to grant the skill of Nazi domination is not to say that there is any revolutionary liberation in Nazi ideas . On the con  --  trary , this is the skill of counter-revolution , the skill of a few men controlling the many , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can oper  --  ate in the modern world only if the many who have liberties resign them or are too weak to defend them . A counter-revolution can not succeed unless the many who have the power are incompetent in holding on to it . And to say or to infer that this is inevitable is to say that it is inevitable that those who have power shall lay it down . Laying it down is an act of will . And an act of will is not inevitable . It is a choice . Moreover , it is a choice against self-interest . And if it is made by the non-German world today , it will be made either because the smooth skill of German tyrannical organization exerts an insane fascination or out of spiritual funk . If Germany , built as it is today on the suppressed liberties of German individuals and the slavery of the lands already conquered , is stronger or can make itself stronger than the people of the world who have freedom and whom it intends to dominate , then the free people have lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? their heritage of liberties . And to imply that the Nazi revolution is inevitable is to imply that all men , save only the members of the German National Socialist Party , or men of their ilk , have lost their zeal and their enterprise . I should make this clear : I am not arguing that this war is not or may not be a phase of a world revolution . In the existing democracies , though we have the civil The NATION liberties , we have by no means kept the economic power diffused . Democratic potentialities remain unrealized , socially , politically , and economically . In modern war the civilians are the soldiers , and their spirit and sacrifices are essential to victory . So after the war the people may insist on sharing the power they do not now wield . That , I should say , is most likely . But if that is revolution , it is not going to be Nazi counter  --  revolution . Anyone who knows the masses of Britain knows they are not waiting to set up a Nazi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a foreign policy of conquest , and the invention of a new slavery under a dominant race . Certainly in this country , which also will be deeply affected by the war in its time , the people have no such longings . What we want in America is more , not less , freedom . The common man wants more , not less , power . But revolutions can and should come without violence if by revolution is meant a transfer of power from a smaller to a larger number . To say that the present war is a phase of a world revolution is not to say that we are doomed to have civil war and putsches wherever there have been maldistributions of political and economic power . It is to say only that we may be living in a time of the quickening of vast forces which will proceed with the long labor of liberation . It is true that profound economic changes are in prog  --  ress . The economic structure of modern society is of an intricacy that would befuddle an Alexander Hamilton or a Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were intact as in Jefferson 's day , and only vaguely apprehend that part of our economic structure is in control of an oligarchy . Fundamentally it differs from the Nazi oligarchy in vital ways : it did not seize its power by trickery and violence , and it is subject to having its power whittled down by free legislative action . Still , it is an oligarchy . Much has been left un  --  done in our democracy . But if this were not true , democ  --  racy would not be worth having . There can be no worse government than a final government . If this is a revolutionary epoch , let us be warned lest we be defrauded by those who offer us counter-revolu  --  tion as being the revolution . If there are Americans with undue political and economic power today who fear to lose it by revolution , they may try to offer us counter  --  revolution instead , not for our sakes but for theirs . For in counter-revolution , though they may have to sacrifice some of their elbow-room , they still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or woman offers us the Nazi revolution as inevitable and for the ultimate good , we should inquire if he is instinctively trying to hold on to undue power , or if he aspires to wield undue power , or if he suffers , as I said before , just from funk . Pure de  --  mocracy , the final goal of all revolution , is a society in which power is diffused , not wielded by a few . And December 21 , 1940 when these salespeople of concentrated power , these oligarchs , call the coming of the Nazi revolution inevita  --  ble , they are wishing it to come . They are making their choice . They want their own freedom , not the freedom of the many . When they advise us to do business with Hitler , to learn to get along with him , we should ask if they are clinging to an undemocratic power or yearning for an undemocratic share of it . True , Hitler is a man one can learn to get along with . One can submit . True , Hitler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his new world order . True , Hitler has been a man of peace . He never fought for anything unless it was denied him . But it is not true that we can secure our freedom by getting along with Hitler , and then , as is naively sug  --  gested , by improving democracy within our boundaries . If an eighty-ton tank is bearing down on one 's house , one does n't defend it by hanging better curtains in the62.9 living-room window or by giving the domestic help a box-spring bed . One defends it with anti-tank guns . I grant you the democratic mansion needs better curtains , and it is a scandal that the domestic help has n't had a decent bed . But imperfect though it is , the mansion is worth defending . It is the best mansion , by and large , that the human family has yet had to occupy . And it is far more comfortable , inside and out , than a Nazi tank . Those who try to sell us the Nazi counter-revolution as a revolution have made their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And when they imply it is the inevitable good , they are trying to sap men 's minds with the worst of social potions , inaction . There is one completely effective answer to them : that the rest of us choose freedom , not only the freedom which we now enjoy even if we have not used it too wisely , but the freedom to grow more wise and more free . A Talk with Philip Murray BY ROSE M. STEIN Washington , D. C. , December 10 THE C. I. 0 . ' s new generalissimo , Philip Murray , is something of an enigma to the public . Although he has been a vital force in the American labor movement for almost forty years he has always been content to play a secondary role ; in his own words , he has " plugged along the mill gates " close to the people he has worked with all his life . As second in command of both the powerful United Mine Workers and the C. I. 0. , he has kept clear of politics and never sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  main behind the scenes and let the applause and flash  --  lights concentrate on his chief . Now that he has been thrust into top place , a good deal of speculation has arisen among varied groups as to what he will or will not do . Complicating the situation is the fact that the retiring head remains not too far in the background and is known to be of a temperament which does not relish a secondary position . Philip Murray can resolve this speculation in one of two ways : he can announce his intentions through the country 's headlines , or he can proceed quietly on a choseri course of action and let the results reveal to the nation where he stands . Without a shadow of a doubt he will do the latter . He is not the kind of leader who , in a manner designed to capture popular fancy , addresses himself to the public at large regardless of the conse  --  consequences to the group he represents . His primary concern is to further the well-being of his group , and all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is aresponsible rather than a " pop  --  ular " leader . To the specific questions , therefore , whether Philip Murray will " clean house , " fire this man and re  --  place him with that , reorganize this local or that council , the answer is that as a responsible labor leader he is not interested in making spectacular announce  --  ments even though the front pages are eager to quote him , or in providing a forum for dissidents , or in spending time on minor tasks when major ones are pressing . It is on major issues that Philip Murray will concentrate his attention . Seated behind a massive mahogany desk in his spa  --  cious office in the United Mine Workers ' Building in Washington , he sketched for me in broad outline his organization 's projected " program of action . " Despite phenomenal organizational gains in the past few years and many legislative and judicial victories , labor is con  --  fronted today with problems so grave and so far-reach  --  ing that the welfare of the whole nation depends upon their successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter when it could confine itself to the task of bargaining and fighting for higher wages , shorter hours , better working conditions . Now , in a period of advancing technology , centralized control , and huge gov
