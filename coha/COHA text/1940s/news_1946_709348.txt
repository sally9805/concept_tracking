txt LOWER TAXES on earned than on un- , earned income will almost certainly be proposed when the next revenue bill is being framed . A suggestion for different treatment of the two kinds of income was advanced recently by General Albert J. Browning . director of the Office of Domestic Commerce . Gen. Browning holds that high tax rates on earned income are destroying incentive to effort by men whose ability is of particular value to the economy . He cites the case of a corporation head with a salary of $200,000 . This executive , having a large amount of other income and a country home , must maintain a home in New York City to handle his job . and his living costs here total considerably more than his net income from salary , after taxes . He figures he is working for less than nothing , and is considering retiring and living at his country home . Gen. Browning 's idea has attracted considerable attention and some sympathy in legislative quarters . It is suggested , however , that it will be difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds of income . . ? . EARNED INCOME differentiation from unearned would be no new thing in tax legislation . In most years since 1913. when the income tax went into effect , taxpayers have been allowed a credit for earned income in one way or another . For many years ending with 1943 ? no earned income credit has been allowed since that year  --  the credit was 1O " , of earned income , but not to exceed 10% of net income . The maximum credit Willi $1,400 and it applied only against normal tax income . Revival of the earned income credit on the 1943 basis would be of little benefit to earners of high salaries . It would reduce their tax by $42 . To be worth-while to these individuals such a credit would not only have to be applicable to surtax income , but the maximum credit would have to be increased substantially . Rather than a credit . Gen. Browning suggests a different and lower schedule of tax rates to apply to earned income , as compared with rates on income from dividends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however . also have substantial unearned income . It appears that a highly complicated schedule would be necessary to meet ; this situation SALARY INCREASES mean less and less , atter taxes . as the salary level rises . Thus the incentive to effort , to earn more . Is increasingly reduced . The $50,000-a-year man whose salary is increased by $10,000 , takes home nearly 29 cents of each dollar of the increase . The $100,000-a-year man would take home only 15,4 cents of each additional dollar . These figures , moreover , do not allow for the added impact of state taxes . Where the salary earner has substantial other income , his net salary may be reduced nearly to the vanishing point . This is the reason several high-paid executives have voluntarily reduced their compensation in recent years . At least one has refused to accept any salary .

OKLAHOMA 'S NEW LAW enweering community property has been recognized by the Bureau of Internal Revenue as satisfying the tests prescribed by the U. S. Supreme Court . Recognition applies , however , only to community income received or accrued on and after July 26 , 1945 , the effective date of the measure . Hawaii 's new community property law is similarly recognized . effective June 1 , 1945 ? ? ? AN INVENTOR 'S property right in an invention begins when the device is completed and ready for use , not when patented . So holds the U. S. Tax Court in the case of Edward C. Myers . The inventor , whose only invention was a rubber-covered flexible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Co. , in January . 1932 , the exclusive right to " use , manufacture and sell " it . The questions at issue were whether the transaction with Goodrich represented the sale of a capital asset and , if it did , whether this asset had been held more than two years , making the gain taxable only to the extent of 50% . The Court pointed to the wide rights given Goodrich and to the fact that Myers was not in the business of marketing inventions . It held that the sale was that of a capital asset . Moreover , although patent on the invention was not applied for until shortly after the sale to Goodrich , and not granted until 1936 , the Court found that the holding period began in 1929 , when the invention was perfected , and that the gain to Myers was a long term capital gain . ? ? ?
