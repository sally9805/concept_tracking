Premier U Saw of Burma is a tough talker . About to leave London for the U.S. last week , he admitted a passage at words with Winston Churchill : " Churchill ... was very blunt . I was blunt too . " <P> Instead of a promise of dominion status for Burma , which he had flown to London to demand ( TIME , Nov. 3 ) , U Saw had won only the reiteration of an old and hazy promise to discuss self-government after the war . In Washington he hoped to persuade President Roosevelt to intercede with his co-author of the Atlantic Charter to apply it manfully to Burma .
