Dr. Marcel Petiot 's 63 murders did not impress the atrocity-hardened French . But they were impressed by his agile defense and sheer gall last week in a trial in which his condemnation had seemed certain . Ceiling-high rows of victims ' valises ( containing 97 petticoats , 57 pairs of socks , and 97 shirts ) failed to shake Petiot . Nor was he perturbed during the court 's visit to his fashionable Paris home and ex-slaughter house , where they found a strange conglomeration of expensive Louis XVI furniture , human bones , and 600 volumes of murder mysteries . <P> When jurors scoffed at his story that he and his mysterious Resistance band killed only Gestapo hirelings , 49-year-old Petiot proved that at least three of his victims were German agents . As neatly as he had carved up his victims , Petiot parried and thrust at the prosecutors and judge , who conceded grudgingly that he had " won almost every point " in the trial 's first days . Points for Petiot : <P> <P> When asked why he killed the mistresses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could you do with them ? " <P> He explained his visit to one victim : " Her daughter was pretty . " When the prosecution insisted that , on the contrary , she was " of extreme homeliness , " Petiot demanded that a photograph be brought to court to support his taste . <P> His reason for refusing to identify his alleged Resistance associates : " I would n't dare name them in this court . There are too many Ptainists here . " <P> When accused of earning 300,000 francs in 1940 and only declaring 25,000 in his income-tax return , Petiot smiled : " That only proves I am a Frenchman . " <P> To a judge 's request for a description of the death of one " Franois the Corsican , " he sneered : " So you want to know the details ? I must say you have sadistic tastes . " <P> As Petiot 's chances for acquittal ( still slim ) improved , a book he had written in prison was published in Paris . Its title : Beating the Odds .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
