They had met to dedicate their 20-year-old organization to a new purpose : upholding democracy in the U. S. <P> I. S. S. ( headquarters : Geneva ) was organized in 1920 to help European students made destitute by World War I. Since 1933 it has been helping refugee students : German Jews , Czechs , Spaniards , Chinese . Studious and conscientious , I. S. S. was disturbed by the activities of the American Youth Congress , by an increasing tendency of grownups to get fed up with Youth . Thereupon I. S. S.

By week 's end the delegates had succeeded in squelching these noisy spokesmen , went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world problems .
