High up , the plane was a tiny object in the sky , but the handful of Army officers watching it from their steel- &-concrete; tower could hear its voice from 10,000 ft. up : <P> " Hello , bombing field , this is b23 . We have a 2,000-lb. bomb to drop . " Before the plane came over the 20-ft. white X on the pock-marked ground a mile from the observers , its bomb doors opened . The bomb flopped out . The men in the tower could see it , a short pencil line hanging horizontal for a fraction of a second . Then its nose jerked down as the tail fins caught the air . <P> The bomb arched earthward in a wide parabola . Twenty-six seconds passed . At last the men in the tower saw it strike the target , saw a puny , firecracker flash of flame , followed by a pipe-smoker 's puff of smoke . An instant later came hell . The ground erupted like a volcano . A halo of yellow flame flared from the spot . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blasted wood , little trees poured upward for a hundred feet , like a Niagara running backward . <P> All this , but at the concrete bastion there had not yet been a sound . Then came the concussion . Even a mile away behind walls of concrete , there was a jerk , a jar and the observers felt as if Paul Bunyan had slapped them on the back . <P> Those who had not been through it before thought that was all , but it was n't . Now , last of all , came the sound , no shriek of the bomb falling , but the sudden , shocking , dull , booming blast of the explosion . <P> That is what it is like to be inside a sturdy observation tower a mile from the exploding block busters which the Army is now testing at the Aberdeen Proving Ground . But the observers do n't go through it for the sensation . The craters are measured , the radius of destruction noted ( everything within 100 yards is destroyed and a man might be killed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ordnance is the weapon itself-the number and shape of the fragments from the exploded bomb , the action of the powder charge . All this data is filed so that the science of destruction can be improved . <P> The Army got around to making public last week something that its Aviation Cadets had known for months : its maximum dimensions for fighter pilots are 5 ft. 9 in. in bare feet , 170 Ib. on the scale . The Air Forces prefer candidates for fighter training who are a little smaller to start with . Fighter cockpits are built for nothing bigger .
