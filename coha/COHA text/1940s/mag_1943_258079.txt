An American merchant ship was on the high seas this week carrying the highest-paid able seaman in U.S. maritime history : tough , balding Joe Curran , $5,200-a-year president of the C.I.O. National Maritime Union . <P> Seaman Joe , who wants to see battlefront ports in England , Africa and Russia , had waited for two months for a passport . While his application lay in the doldrums , he hopped a boat for his first job as a working seaman since 1936 . <P> Behind him , on dry land , Seamari Joe 's aggressive , left-wing union made more history . It threw the longest picket line of World War II ( 1,500 men ) around the boxlike World-Telegram building in lower Manhattan to protest the labor-baiting writings of Scripps-Howard Columnist Westbrook Pegler . <P> No one has belted N.M.U. harder or more consistently than Columnist Pegler . He has pictured N.M.U. as a Communist cell attempting to convert all of U.S. labor ; has accused Joe Curran of draft dodging . ( Curran , married but childless , was deferred as an essential worker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infuriated N.M.U.ers-who boil over at the mere mention of Pegler 's sleeping-car first name-was the columnist 's revival of the old scuttlebutt , repeatedly and officially denied , that U.S. merchant sailors mutinied at Guadalcanal . <P> The pickets , joined by A.F. of L. printers from the World-Telegram composing room , circled the building for two hours , chanting : " We 're out to win the war , what the hell is Pegler for ? " Then an N.M.U. committee tramped to the office of Lee B. Wood , World-Telegram executive editor , handed him a statement which protested the " vile , Nazi-like statements by ... Westbrook Pegler . " When Editor Wood had no comment , he was threatened by an N.M.U. spokesman : " You people better watch out . If you do n't remove this guy you 'll have more than picket lines around this office . " <P> Columnist Pegler was not there to see the show . He was agonizing , as is his editorial wont , over his next day 's column on his 35-acre Westchester County estate ( where the pond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Pegler heard of the demonstration he promptly wrote another fire-eating column on N.M.U. , tartly reminded his readers that early in 1941 N.M.U. had picketed the <P> White House with signs " The Yanks Are n't Coming . " <P> This week N.M.U. began " permanent picketing " of the World-Telegram.
