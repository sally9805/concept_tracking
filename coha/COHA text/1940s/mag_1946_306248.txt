The veteran-on-campus was beginning to rustle the ivy . Last week the Daily Bruin , student newspaper of the University of California at Los Angeles , devoted a four-column spread to the educational opinions of 22-year-old Jay Douglas Haley , late of the A.A.F. Excerpts : <P> " The educational system of America is failing the youth of America ! . . . It is fashioning sparrows and pushing them out to compete with hawks . . . . Why on earth should we be taught . . . this foolishness about honesty , truth and fair play ? . . . <P> " If a student is majoring in law , he should be taught not only the laws but the most approved methods ... of finding the loopholes . . . . If he is to be a doctor , he should not only learn medicine but how to milk the largest fees . . . . If an engineer , how to construct with the cheapest of materials . . . . If a journalist , how-to slant , alter , lie . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods of watering stocks and duping the suckers . . . . <P> " Let us get up petitions to remove these namby-pamby professors stumbling on their White Horse Truth , and get some good hardheaded businessmen in our colleges to teach us what we have to know to become a success .
