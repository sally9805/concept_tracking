GRASSHOPPERS ' FIELD DAY A STORY BY DOROTHY BAKER T WAS sunny and sharp at once and I there were yellow leaves on the steps of the Charles Street subway exit , blown all the way there from the Public Garden . It could very well be the last day of faIl , a day for grasshoppers to start reproaching themselves with a flighty summer , a day for ants to settle back with satisfaction . Each according to his temperament . The colored girl came up from the subway and the wind gave her a good stiff push . She was wearing a reversible coat , tweed side out , and a soft gray beret with the slack pulled forward like a cap . She took a look around and then started up the street against the wind . She was on her way to an address written on a piece of paper in her pocket , but she was n't rushing to get there . There were things to look at , and she looked at all of them , all the shapes and colors in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the antique stores , all . And when she came to Mt . Vernon Street where she had to turn off she made a full stop and stood for a few minutes watching , perfectly idly , the people and the cars . It was only when she started to climb the hill , up Mt . Vernon Street , that she began to look alive and purposeful . She watched the numbers as she went : 14 , 16 , 18 , 20 , and she stayed on the even side of the street and kept on going until she got to the one written on the piece of paper in her pocket . She stopped in front of the door , took out the piece of paper , just to be sure , and then stood as far away from the house as she could , balancing on the curb to get a better look . Nice house , a nice modern brick apartment house ; not one of the ones made over from antiques , but a slick one , all new stuff . She walked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of tenants for the name Cline . And it was there . Apartment 11 : Mr. Edward J. Cline . Lucky number . She unhooked the receiver and punched the button beside number eleven . A voice comes to you if anyone 's home . So she stood there and waited with the receiver against her car , and after awhile she heard a voice saying , " Well ? " Just well , not who is it , please , or what do you want ? There 's no answer for it , so the girl went on waiting , and when the voice said , " Well ? " again , but louder , she put her mouth against the grill , took a deep breath , and shouted , " It 's from the agency . " She was hanging up the receiver when the door clicked , and she missed it . So the whole thing had to be done over , and what with setbacks and misunderstandings , it was a full five minutes before she faced Mrs. Cline herself . " When you hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , and she made it sound as if she were saying that opportunity knocks but once . " Yes , ma'am . " Mrs. Cline had width and she was tall too . Dressed , she might even have style , but she was not dressed . She was wearing big flat sheepskin slippers and a large-patterned house-coat , or possibly hostess-gown . Literally n6gligee in this case . The whole apartment was somewhat n6glig6 in fact , and Mrs. Cline too far behind in enthusiasm to do anything about it . She had a nice new pack of cards in her hand and she kept working with it , squaring it up , and running a thumb along the edges and corners , while she sized up the girl . She wanted first to know about references , whom had she worked for before , and why had she quit , and the girl answered in a good clear voice that she had been working for the Government for three years steady , running a foot machine in the colored sewing project and getting fourteen dollars a week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the nicest line of work she had ever had . In her project they made layettes and gave them away to all the babies that happened to get born on relief . Prettiest little outfits , all with handmade buttonholes . Only thing , there was some kind of a mix-up between the Government and the City , and they closed up the project . That was the beginning of summer . " Lots of them would rather be on relief than work for a living at a real job , " Mrs. Cline said , but there was n't any feeling in it ; it was only a piece of all-purpose conversation , like the dryness of steam heat or have you read any good books ? She did n't believe it or care . It was only a thing to say and , naturally enough , it did n't get any response . " You do n't have to stand up , " she said . " Sit down . " The girl sat down beside the sofa and waited . Mrs. Cline opened her mouth to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , suddenly , almost as if she could n't help it , she shuffled the cards , set the pack on the coffee table between them , and said , " Cut . " The girl did n't cut . She just sat there , and Mrs. Cline told her howjust lift the top off anywhere . Then she cut about three-quarters of the way down and turned over the ten of spades . Mrs. Cline looked thoughtfully at the few cards left , and then pushed back the sleeve of her house-coat . She broke the pack at the queen of diamonds , laid it face-up on the table , and looked a little silly . But after that she seemed happier . She got down to business and said what was on her mind . Shc wanted a good reliable girl from eleven o'clock in the morning until six at night . Six days a week , six dollars a week . Fair enough . The girl did n't snap it up . She said the way she understood it , they work mostly a half a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for five dollars a week and carfare ; or else they work a full day , ten in the morning until eight at night for ten dollars a week and carfare . " My sister 's girl friend , she gets ten dollars a week and carfare . " " What 's this carfare racket ? " Mrs. Cline said . " Never heard of it . " The girl said it was ten cents each way to and from work , that makes twenty cents a day , six days a week , that makes a dollar-twenty a week coming right out of your pay . Spend your pay getting back and forth to work . " Lincoln did n't ask for carfare when he walked five miles to return the book he borrowed , do n't forget it , " Mrs. Cline said . She pulled one corner of her mouth in tight and drummed her fingers stiffly on the sofa cushion beside her . The drumming raised a little dust . " Remind me to show you how to work the attachments for the vacuum . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ma'am . And she did n't look at Mrs. Cline . She looked at the big black grand piano by the window and she looked at the carpet . Nice blue broadloom , and if there 's anything to it about cigarette ashes keeping the moths out , this one was safe . " Come in at eleven and you 're through at six . Six dollars a week 's a lot of money for that , with no references . " " Only I live clear down past Central Square , and that 's more than five miles , " the girt said , thinking always of Lincoln . " I got to get carfare . " Mrs. Cline flung up her hands . " All right , then , carfare . And where do I come out ? The little end of the stick , that 's all . " She must have meant horn but she said stick . There was a time of silence . The girl did n't look up and Mrs. Cline went back to her drumming . " How old are you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like fourteen . What 's your name ? " " Carol . Carol Darcy . " Mrs. Cline lifted the lid of a silver cigarette box on the coffee table beside her , picked out a mentholated cigarette , lighted it , and drew it down deep . " God , I 'm tired , " she said . It was a simple and moving statement , a sad piece of information that passed from one woman to the other and left its effect on both of them . They just sat there for awhile , quiet except for the deep sighs of cigarette smoke Mrs. Cline blew out . " Whenever I hear the name Carol , " Mrs. Cline said finally and gently , " I always have to think of the king that ran away with the red-headed woman and would n't come back . He went kiting off and left his little boy to be king  --  fat little kid all dressed up in a soldier suit . I never can remember the woman 's name . " " They named me Carol because my birthday 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently , reminded Mrs. Cline of the baby . " Would you like to see the baby ? " The agency had n't made mention of a baby , and that was probably because Mrs. Cline had n't mentioned it to the agency when she put in her bid . It 's very bad not to mention a serious item like a baby when applying for help , and Carol Darcy 's face showed it . A baby is never a cinch . Mrs. Cline showed the way , huffing and puffing up the stairs . " Watch yourself you do n't slip in the sawdust , " she said . " Mr. Cline and the boy were up here sawing some blocks to put under the baby 's play-pen to keep her out of the draughts , and they got sawdust from here to breakfast . The boy 's twelve and already in high school . " The agency did n't say anything about a boy either . They just said one lady in a nice elevator apartment . The baby was sleeping on her face with her knees drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a face but her hair was nice . Tight little brown curls all over her head . Mrs. Cline shut the door with a bang , and the baby turned her head to the side and opened one eye and then turned her head away again . But Mrs. Cline did n't mean for her to go back to sleep and she offered delicate irritants  --  like pats on the head and low hoo-hoo noises ? until the baby gave up the idea of sleep and pulled herself together and sat up . She looked groggy for a moment , rocky like one of those weighted tumble-dolls , and then very suddenly she stiffened her back and put on a smile with two teeth in it and began to patty-cake . " Watch her now , " Mrs. Cline said , " she 's going to try to roll it . Come on , Cooky , that 's right . Roll it , and pat it , and mark it with B. " She looked sidewise at Carol and said low out of the side of her mouth : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How old is she ? " " Nine months , " said Mrs. Cline , " and do n't think it has n't been some eighteen months for me . At my age . " She shook her head and her face turned ashy . " You ca n't have babies at my age , " she said . Then she stopped to think a minute , and was forced to add , " Except me . " Carol Darcy squatted down on her heels and looked through the bars of the crib at the baby . There was no doubt about it that Mrs. Cline , even at her age , had a very cute baby , patty-caking there in her crib with her red tongue hanging out and her eyes as round as pennies . A very cute baby  --  if you like babies . There was a little question in the baby 's mind . She had to stop patty-caking and look , all uninhibited and undecided , at the color of the face outside the bars . But once she had convinced herself she liked it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She screamed high with joy and got back to her clapping . " Now , roll it now . " Carol Darcy unbuttoned the collar of her coat and talked direct to the baby in a low , easy voice . " Look , and then you pat it , see , same thing over again , and then you mark it with a B. Now , you mark it , just like this , you mark . Just look here at me how I 'm marking it . Mark it , nothing to it , you just got ta mark it with a B , and that 's all then . You roll it , and you pat it , and you mark it with a B , and you slap it in the oven , and you 're through for the day . " " That 's not how it goes , " Mrs. Cline started to say , and then she stopped , open-mouthed , and said , " Well , what do you know ! " " How 's that for marking it ? " Carol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Cline said . " It took somebody like you to come along and teach her how to mark it . " The girl watched the baby all the time and said to Mrs. Cline : " Babies learn stuff faster than anybody . Put a little time to them and they 'll learn anything . Only you got to make up your mind what you want them to learn , because they can pick up meanness so fast . Look at her , she 's marking it again . " In a corner there was a little chair with a bright chintz slip-cover on it . Mrs. Cline went to it , sat down heavily , and looked out of the window . When she spoke it was sadly , about how much fun she 'd had with the boy when he was a baby . Taught him how to hum tunes before he could talk . Had him housebroke , absolutely , by the time he was six months old . Anybody was as safe as if they were in God 's pocket with that babyboy on their lap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get older it 's not the same to hear little yip-yips at five-thirty in the morning . You do n't feel like bouncing out of bed and warming a bottle of milk . Maybe it might be all right at nine-thirty or a quarter to ten , but five-thirty comes early . You want to shut out the yips and turn over on your back . Lovely baby too , but not at Mrs. Cline 's age . Forty-eight , to be perfectly frank . And what kind of an age is that to have a baby , with Mr. Cline traveling most of the month and the boy in high school ? " I 've got . I 've got my hobby , " she said . " And I can double my money when the numbers are running right . " To say double , in fact , was to put it very modestly . " Did you see the piano downstairs ? " Carol looked up and nodded . " Well , I paid that off in three months , for the boy to take lessons on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colored girl squatting on her heels in front of the baby 's crib . Couple of curly heads , one outside looking in , the other inside looking out . And Mrs. Cline in a corner , older and not so curly . She shook her head and bit her lip and began to count on her fingers , first separating her index finger from the other four , then the middle finger , then the ring finger . That left the little finger all by itself . She held the three fingers in a bundle together , looked long at the little finger , then shook her head slowly and took it into the fold . It was an act that seemed to take a lot of courage . " All I need is a little surplus , a little something behind me , so that they ca n't clean me out before I get lucky , " Mrs. Cline said in anger , and only for herself to hear . " Only how does anybody expect me to make a killing when I 'm behind to begin with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; ten for food and cigarettes , right out of it like that ; and you want six and a dollar-twenty for carfare : seven-twenty . All right , that 's ten plus seven-twenty makes sev-enteen-twenty . So I get two-eighty a week to play . " Mrs. Cline dropped a hand to her lap , took hold of a button on the front of her house-coat and jerked it off in desperation . " That thing 's been loose for a month , " she said . " How 'd you like to do one of your W.P.A. jobs on it ? " " Yes , ma'am , " said Carol , and the baby said , " Ya ya . " " Listen at her copying me off , " she said , but Mrs. Cline had something else on her mind . " It 's a funny thing , " she said . " Ever since I 've had the baby I 've been strapped here so tight I could n't get out and make any money , and now I 've got you to come in so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money left to stake myself . You ca n't win if you do n't buy a decent stack . Anybody knows that . You 've got to have a little something to go on . " The words came out and made their sound , but they did n't affect anyone but the speaker . Neither the colored girl nor the baby had any comment to make . It was n't their hobby . Mrs. Cline was n't complaining to anyone in particular or about any particular thing . It was a set of circumstances , that 's all  --  a set of very annoying , you might say maddening , circumstances . She was still a free spirit , but no longer a free agent , and that 's one of the very unhappiest combinations . To be blest with a pure passion , and to be restrained by one last barrier from indulging it . During the last hour she had succeeded in ridding herself of a ball-and-chain only to find a leg-iron on her other leg . The ball-and-chain is more noticeable , but the leg-iron is almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean up in any kind of game of chance ( or skill ) with only two dollars and eighty cents a week to risk ? You start with the pikers and that 's where you end . The baby put one hand outside the bars and took hold of Carol Darcy 's sleeve , and said , " Ba ba ba ba ba , " with the accent on the first one . " Ba ba ba ba ba , " Carol said , " right back at you . " " Listen , " said Mrs. Cline . " I 've got to think . " She thought , and when she had done she looked up satisfied and said to Carol that she 'd tell her what she 'd do if she wanted her to  --  she 'd keep her pay for her , all except the carfare , six dollars every week , and then in four months , or six months , or a year , just however she wanted it , instead of having frittered it all away , the way so many young girls do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to show for her work . The girl , still squatting on her heels in front of the crib , looked up at Mrs. Cline , and on her face it was clearly written that this was a proposition in which she had no interest whatever , except possibly as an oddity in propositions . She did n't even bother to answer it , and in the end Mrs. Cline was obliged to come right out and ask her did she or did n't she like the idea of having her pay saved for her . It got a direct answer . Miss Darcy said quite calmly that she 'd just as leave have it by the week , but thanks just the same . " Well , " Mrs. Cline said , " you 're so great on this W.P.A. work I thought maybe you 'd be for the OM Age Pension Plan too . This would work out something like that , only it would be just between us and no red tape or standing in line . " " Thanks just the same , " Carol Darcy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was beat . She was finished , and she looked it . She sagged back in the chintz chair . Try to imagine being free from eleven until six , six days a week , days when anything could happen , days when she could n't lose . To go into the deep velvet salon of Mrs. Francis and buy a stack of chips , a stack of chips with some body to it , some weight , and sit behind that stack of chips until it became stacks of chips . You do it by careful heeding of clear , well-grounded hunches , and the last chip you put on the board , just before the wheel stops turning , is often the one that does it . Oh , very often . You practically hear a voice prompting you to play number seventeen straight , and you drop five , ten chips on it , centered right there , and the wheel stops , and you do n't look , but you hear a voice , a real voice , that says it . " Number seventeen , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red-leather salon of Eddie Sloane where they play a combination of Beano and Tango called Reeno , and where they keep a tray of assorted cigarettes at your elbow , and invite you into an inner bar to have an old-fashioned on the house if you 're winning . Or losing . Things like that . An afternoon of that , with the endless possibilities of the few numbers , can leave you feeling you 've been somewhere , and you can come home to your baby and your boy and be who you area real living person that 's been out in the world taking chances and heeding hunches and paying for a piano  --  not just a tired , frowsy , apathetic , almost old Mrs. Cline . " The money I 've made in my day , " Mrs. Cline said out loud . " Start of the week with ten dollars and run it up to two hundred by Saturday night . Over and over I 've done that . " She slowed down and said very simply , " I 'm good . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and I can always make it happen . " She meant it , and it was the strict truth . How else could there have been a grand piano downstairs ? Mrs. Cline had the eye of a sainted martyr . She was beaten and she was broken but she still had the faith . " We could make it a percentage , " she said . " With my two-eighty and your six dollars . I could double that little six dollars for you if you really wanted me to play it . I do n't say I 'd do it every week . Sometimes I could bring you eighteen , twenty dollars , sometimes only eight or nine . But I can tell you one thing , it would n't be any measly six . " It was her last plea , and it did n't get her anywhere with Carol Darcy . " I got to get my pay , that 's all , " the girl said . " I 've been taking a vacation all summer and now I 've got to get my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying my sister back for things . " " All right , " Mrs. Cline said . She faced her defeat , tired and resigned . She was really old , too old to have a baby , too old for anything . She just sat there old . It was one o'clock . The girl stood up and said , " Could I fix you some lunch , or anything ? " " I do n't care , " said Mrs. Cline , and it was the whole truth . Carol Darcy turned toward the door , and the baby , watching her go , went all to pieces . " Take her with you , why do n't you ? " Mrs. Cline said . She was holding the button of her house-coat in her hand and looking at it too closely . Downstairs , the new girl took a look . At first glance the cupboard was bare , but one by one little odds and ends began coming to light , and she put the baby on the floor and ad-libbed what amounted to an egg Benedict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liverwurst on the toast , poached egg on the liverwurst , and a cream sauce over the whole thing . She stuck it under the broiler , and then she found some cold beets , sliced them and poured French dressing over them . She did the whole thing with her beret and reversible on and without once stepping on the baby . She was seized with an unaccountable , almost mystical , eagerness to please Mrs. Cline and to bring comfort to her in her sadness . At the first sound of Mrs. Cline 's slow step on the stairs she whipped the egg into its place at the table , set the salad diagonally beside it , and stood by . Mrs. Cline was still holding the button . There were red splotches on her face , and the fire in her eye was all dead and gone . She came into the dining room , stood a moment at the window , and then went to the table . She looked down . " What is it ? " she said . " Dropped egg , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mrs. Cline said in a tired but kindly voice . " It looks very thee . " She pulled the chair back and sat down and stared , without recognition , at the egg . Carol Darcy went back into the kitchen . The baby was under the sink , looking into the wastebasket and picking all the red pieces of paper out of it . Carol looked at the baby and made a face at her . It was only a routine face made by sticking out the tongue , rolling up the eyes , and wiggling the fingers from the ears , but it pleased the baby enormously and she laughed high and long . Carol Darcy laughed too and danced a couple of steps toward the baby . It was a preliminary to swooping her up in her arms , and the baby expected it , but it did n't happen . She turned her back on the baby instead and stood facing the door to the dining room , biting a finger thoughtfully . She made a step toward the door , then stopped and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her beret . Then she unbuttoned her reversible , dropped it behind her on the floor , and carefully pushed open the dining-room door . Mrs. Cline had not eaten her egg . She was sitting exactly where she had been when Carol left , just sitting there . When she saw Carol she pulled her chair up to the table and picked up a fork , to prove she was pleased with the egg . " Mizz Cline , " the girl said , " I was just out there thinking , and . . . " She stopped and swallowed , and then she went ahead , " And if you still want to take my six dollars and double it for me for awhile . . . well . . . go ahead and do it . " Mrs. Cline looked hit in the head . She sat there a minute and then cut into her egg as if she had n't eaten for three days . She did n't say a word , she just ate and ate fast , and when there was n't anything left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swallow and stood up . " I'II go do my nails , " she said . " I 'll go do them right now . " She turned at the door . " And let me tell you something , honey . You 'll never regret this as long as you live . "
