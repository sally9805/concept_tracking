As if in one great national seminar , everyone seemed to be " studying " radio last week : <P> The Office of Facts and Figures , while launching its own propaganda program , spurred on its researchers in a study of network broadcasting . Scope : OFF refused to say , except that it aimed to improve and " coordinate " programs of importance in national defense . <P> Musicritic Virgil Thomson found a scholarly volume of radio theses* which proved , among other things , that " radio builds up a pseudo interest in music , " that " popular songs are not popular because people like them , but . . . have been imposed on public taste through the very nearly 100%-efficient plugging process . " <P> Procter &; Gamble , studying its soap opera commercials , wondered if more but shorter ones might create an illusion of less total commercial time . <P> The broadcasters themselves studied radio , admitted that something was wrong . One thing wrong : now that the burden of news broadcasts is so grave , their commercials are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the listener . Last fortnight , at the instance of the Broadcasters ' Victory Council , a committee of the National Association of Broadcasters recommended certain minimum rules for news program commercials . Among them : <P> 1 ) If possible , let the commercial be delivered by a separate announcer . <P> 2 ) Do n't use news terms like " flash " or " good news " in advertising spiels . <P> 3 ) Do n't say , " This news has been brought to you by the courtesy of the Blank department store . " ( News is brought by news services , and no courtesy is involved . ) <P> 4 ) Do n't preface news with long ballyhoo for the sponsor 's product . ( First things should come first . ) <P> 5 ) Do n't interrupt a news story with a commercial . This has a " demoralizing effect . ' ' <P> The U.S. public was also studying radio . War has sensitized many a normally numb ear to the profound difference between commentators like Mutual 's Raymond Gram Swing , whose concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mutual 's $130,000-a-year Gabriel Heatter , whose soughing sanctimony and elephantine fight talk sound most appropriate when he urges the oily virtues of " my good friend , Kreml Shampoo . " <P> Last week several important sponsors took a more adult tone in their messages . On CBS 's evening news roundup , United Fruit went so far as to advise cabbage and spinach along with grapefruit and bananas for the balanced wartime diet . Curt and clearly patriotic was Gruen , which snapped : " Buy a Gruen watch , but buy a defense bond first . " <P> <P> * Radio Research 1941 ; by Paul F.
