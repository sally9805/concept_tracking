The whole letter column of the Saturday Review of Literature was taken up by one letter . The letter-writer was one Gustave Lamartine , onetime head of the French Academy of Design . He had quite a tale to tell : 1 ) he had made a 50,000-franc wager with one Max Gerhardt , Austrian hat designer , that he could design a preposterous hat and get women to wear it ; 2 ) he had won the bet . Wrote he : <P> " The hat was not even a head-covering , since it was almost flat and had to be pinned to the top of the head to remain fixed . Onto this grotesque creation I affixed some unrelated feathers and flowers . ... As I anticipated , the leading milliners of Paris , London and New York enthusiastically hailed the new creation . . . . There were decorations protruding from decorations , colors clashed wherever possible ; long feathers would bristle out at least a foot over the head . . . . <P> " I am writing to the Saturday Review about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is now still in vogue uses much material that would be better used in the war effort . <P> " I am referring here to the countless wires for flower decorations , the millions of long pins necessary to keep the hats in place , the huge tonnage of glue for fixings , the untold quantity of rubber and elastic bands sometimes used instead of pins , the miles of lace going into veils , etc. , etc . . . . <P> " You may be sure that had I realized , back in 1934 and 1935 , that my creation would persist ... I would never have made my ill-fated wager . Moreover , were it not for the war I should probably have carried my secret to the grave . . . . " <P> M. Lamartine had kicked up a rumpus : the Review mailbag began to swell . A doctor wrote in to complain that the use of hatpins " is an actual and potential hazard to the health of our female population " because scalp abrasions invite invasion by the " bacillus Welchii . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There may be no meat on the platter , No coffee , nor butter for bread ; It all seems a trivial matter So long as I have on my head A fluff and a puff and a whimsy Suggestive of Salvador Dali , Irrelevant , flaunting and flimsy , A symbol of feminine folly . . . . " Two publishers wanted to get in touch with Lamartine to persuade him to write a book . Newsreel photographers hammered at Editor Norman Cousins ' door , demanding to know M. Lamartine 's where abouts . Manhattan newsmen tried vainly to find him . A female reporter from the Louisville Courier-Journal tried to get material for a series on hat fads . But M. Lamartine could not be found . <P> Reason : " M. Lamartine " was Editor Cousins , who hates preposterous hats . He had deliberately put obvious flaws in his letter ( e.g. , there is no French Academy of Design ) , was astounded that anyone had been hoaxed by M. Lamartine . <P> This week , unable longer to cope with mail , phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a clean breast of it . Said he : " If the incident results in a single hat that looks like a hat , Old Gus will not have died or lied in vain . "
