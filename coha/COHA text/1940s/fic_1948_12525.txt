As the overture fades , the lights come up , revealing a clearing in a swamp . NAT TURNER , a short tough looking Negro is seated on a tree stump gazing intently into space . He is wearing a battered hat set at a jaunty angle . It is a dark night although occasional flashes of heat lightning can be seen . Thick underbrush and overhanging foliage have shut out all trace of the outside world . The light from a flickering lantern reveals an opening in the wall of tree trunks and bushes to the right of the clearing . It is a path which is immediately swallowed by the surrounding forest . The clearing itself is almost bare . There is an almost unearthly quietness about the place -- the silence is so oppressive that not even the croak of a bullfrog or the chirp of a cricket break into the reverie of the sitter . Suddenly the stillness is broken by the hoot of an owl . NAT listens intently . The hoot is repeated . This time NAT stands up . NAT They 's comin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know it ai n't a trap . ( He moves off into the shadows as the hoot sounds again very close . A pause , then WILL FRANCIS , a Negro of gigantic proportions , enters the clearing . He looks around for a moment before speaking . ) WILL ( Whispering ) Nat ? Where you ? Nat , it 's me , Will Francis . ( He moves further into the clearing as Nat comes out of the shadows. ) p. 3 NAT Here I is , Will . WILL What you hidin ' fo ' , Nat ? NAT Jus ' playin ' safe in case the overseer was usin ' the owl hoot to trap us . WILL He don ' know we gone . We done jus ' like you say an ' took croaker sacks , stuffed ' em wit straw , an ' put ' em in our bunks , so if he come round , he think we all sleepin ' . NAT Where the others ? WILL They all comin ' by different trails , ' bout two minutes apart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , but I thought maybe I better . Hope you don ' min ' none ? NAT No , I don ' min ' . How 'd they take it when you tol ' em ? WILL Well , all I say was you gon tell us tonight how to be free . That make ' em curious right off . But they done got they hopes up ' n down so much befo ' this that naturally they don believe you can do it . NAT Just wait . WILL But they all say they come to hear what you got to say after I ' minded them of the way you cured me of the fever . NAT God cured you , Will . I jus ' asked him to he'p you . WILL So had all the others.  - -  But did n't do no good ' till you come long an ' gim me that potion . p. 4 NAT I learn that from the Indians while I 's preachin ' ' mong them . WILL Don ' care . If it had n't been fo ' you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they know it . So they think maybe you know sump'n although they got they doubts . NAT We bes ' git ready fo ' ' em , Will . ( He takes off his hat and kneels before a tree stump . Will kneels also . ) Gentle , Jedus , sweet Jedus , this is yo ' disciple , Nat Turner , callin ' on you fo ' strength in this hour of trouble . I done like you say an ' called all them I could trus ' together to give ' em yo ' word -- cause it was yo ' word , Lord , jus ' as clear an ' sweet as water bubblin ' up from the earth . ( The hoot is heard again , nearer . ) They 's comin ' , Lord . But I don ' need to tell you that -- you who knows ev'thing , who is ev'ything , who 's made me yo ' disciple to take these people out of bondage , my people , Lord . I don ' know how I gon do it , Lord , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me believe . Make ' em to know I 'm to carry out yo ' mission on this earth jus ' like Christ befo ' me . Then when you 's ready , sen ' me a sigh so I can know the time 's come -- the time fo ' me to lead my people jus ' like Moses done the children of Israel . Amen . ( He remains kneeling for a moment then rises , picks up the hat and sets it on his head at the same jaunty angle . As he does so he sniffs the air , wets a finger , and holds it up trying to catch the direction of the breeze . ) Wind blowin ' from the southeast -- that 's rain . ( TOM , HENRY , and HARK enter. ) p. 5 TOM Here we is , Nat . HARK Hope we ain ' late , Nat . NAT You right on time . HENRY Sho ' God is dark out here . HARK An ' quiet .

JACK How you know ? NAT That 's why I sent fo ' you . We 's gon to be free . That 's what I gon preach . God done tol ' me to . SAM You done talked wit ' God ? NAT I done talked wit ' God .

( The men break into laughter . ) NAT ( Angrily ) He 's the great God almighty , who 'll send yo ' blasphemin ' souls burning in hell fire if you ain ' careful ! ( The laughter stops . There is a pause during which NAT glares at them. ) p. 10 WILL ( Soberly ) Ain ' gon do no good to holler at ' em , Nat , why don ' you jes ' try tellin ' ' em like you done me . I aim ' see nothin ' neither but I believe what you say jus ' the same . HARK Well , maybe we will too , Will . I sorry we carried on like that , Nat . NELSON Well , I ai n't !

Here we runnin ' off at the mouth jus ' like the uprisin ' was comin ' off tomorrow . ( There is a rumble of thunder and the wind begins to rise . ) TOM That 's rain . Speak up , Nat . NAT You all remember what I say jus ' now ? I been waitin ' all my life fo ' God to talk to me . An ' that 's the truth . How I know He gon talk to me ? Look here .

NAT Was Moses crazy ? JACK Naw . But you ain ' Moses . NELSON You got him that time , Jack . ( He laughs . WILL stands up threateningly . ) TOM That all that happen , Nat ? NAT That 's all . You all 's the ones I picked out to help me . My waitin 's over . Now I know what He want me to do , why I been put here . p. 15 TOM Why has you been put here , Nat ? NAT God done ' pointed me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children of Israel . Only they ain ' no Pharoahs , jes ' white folks who say God ' tend for us to be slaves . HENRY They sho is dumb if they thinks that . SAM They 's smart enough to hang them boys up in Richmond . NAT God won ' ready fo ' them to be free . An ' besides they leader Gabriel didn ' have no sign to go forward . TOM This dangerous business you talkin ' , Nat . NAT It 's God 's business , too .

Ain ' a man here wants to be free more'n me . Half white an ' half black like I is . God knows I ain ' in love wit ' no peckerwoods . But I don ' know .

Far as I 'm concerned I ain ' got none . An ' what 's mo ' it ai n't none of yo ' goddam business ! ( Advances toward WILL . ) WILL ( Crossing toward HARK ) Careful how you talk , " white boy .

Did I miss anybody ? p. 18 SAM ( Rising ) Don ' know where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever paid no min ' to what I say no how . TOM We listen this time . SAM I 'm ' sposed to be crazy dumb boy . I heard Marse Travis tell the overseer one day : " Don ' bother that black boy . He ain ' right up here . ( He points to his head . ) That 's how come I do like I wants -- white folks thinks I crazy an ' some of the black ones too . ( He glances around at the group . The rumble of thunder again and flashes of lightning . ) TOM Hurry up , Sam . Rain 's comin ' . SAM Well , I tired of actin ' like a fool so 's I can git along . What difference do it make if Nat didn ' really hear them voices ? NAT But I tell you I did . You got to believe that -- all of you -- else we 's doomed from the start .

If God tol ' Nat we 's to free the slaves then we bound to do it . p. 19 TOM ( Slowly ) That take care of ev'ybody but me . ( SAM sits down ) ( The thunder again . ) I think I know how you mens feel . You want to be free like Sam say . A man got a right to have a family an ' a place of his own . Us ' ud all like to read an write , an ' wear fine clothes , know I would anyhow . Then we ask ourse'ves , how come ? Why we got ta be slaves ? Why we ai n't free ? Is that the way it ' sposed to be ? Us don ' know , but we think maybe it wrong . Then Marse Travis talk one day , an he read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sump'n which he said -- mean that the Lord mean fo ' us to be slaves . Now Nat learn to read that same Bible an ' he say God don ' say that . God say fo ' us to be free . Then if Nat right , Marse Travis wrong . He been lyin ' . NAT You right . He been lyin ' ! TOM An if God say fo ' us to be free , then us is bound to be free ! SAM Free , Lord , free ! NELSON No mo ' whuppin 's on the rack . WILL No mo ' breakin ' on the wheel ! SAM Real free ! No mo ' misery , no mo ' care . TOM ( Slowly and firmly ) Yeah , real free , but the whole thing turn on whether God really say that . p. 20 NAT ( Protesting ) But I don ' tol ' you.  --  TOM I know you done tol ' us , Nat . But can you prove it ? Maybe you been imaginin ' them things -- maybe you ain ' from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free --  maybe --  WILL ( Menacingly ) He 's telling the truth ! TOM Then let him prove it . If he can prove it then I say , let 's have the uprisin ' . Let 's foller Nat Turner ! NAT Why I got to prove it ? Why ca n't you take my word ? TOM ( Speaking rapidly ) You a powerfully smart man , Nat . You can read , write , an ' preach . You done even cure Will when the doctor say he gon die . But we ignorant . We know that . We ca n't read the Bible -- ca n't do nothin ' but what Marse Travis tell us to . If you was wrong an ' we still was to foller you -- don ' you see ? We all be killed fo ' nothin ' . That 's how come we gon ' believe only what we can see -- then we know it the truth . NAT ( Quietly ) What you want me to do ? TOM ( After a pause ) Let us hear you talk wit ' God . ( The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It don ' happen like that . You couldn ' hear Him no way less'n he wanted you to . p. 21 TOM Then show us sump'n so we can know you 's speakin ' the truth . Sump 'm like Moses done when he turn the stick into a serpent . An ' make the sea open up so the children of Israel could cross . NAT Moses done them things ' cause the Lord wanted to show him his power . JACK Don ' the Lord want to show you his power ? NAT No . ' Cause I know it 's him that 's talkin ' to me . TOM ( Interrupting ) Well , did n't Jesus turn water into wine and walk on the sea , an ' feed thousands wit two loaves of bread ? NAT Yes . TOM An ai n't God ' pointed Him to save the world , includin ' the children of Israel ? NAT Yes . TOM Then how come you ca n't do sump'n like that ? NAT I ai n't tried . WILL You can do it Nat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , an ' little Jeremy when he was spittin ' up blood , an ' git rid of all Aunt Mary 's warts . NAT Yes . WILL Well , then . JACK I know sump'n better than that . You know old C'unLou , do n't you , Nat ? p. 22 NAT She the one that Belle take care of ? JACK That 's her . HENRY That 's one of his gals . JACK Go to hell ! She ain ' walk in five years . Can ' no medicine cure her . If you could make her walk , then I 'll know you got power from God . TOM Me , too . HENRY An ' me . HARK All of us will . NAT You 're askin ' me to pass a miracle . TOM That 's right , Nat . An ' t'ai n't no use talkin ' to us if you can ' show us one . ( There is a crash of thunder . It is continuous now . ) Come on , we got to make time . ( He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( He goes . ) HARK See you , Nat , Will . ( He followers SAM out . ) NELSON ( Leaving ) You better cover yo ' head up , Henry . If that water on the inside hear that rain fallin ' it might try to get out . ( Laughter ) HENRY Listen at them bull frogs , wo n't you ? They sho ' want that rain bad . ( They all go out. ) p. 23 WILL Nat . Ai n't you gon ' try to stop ' em ? NAT ( Shaking his head ) No . WILL They 's crazy , Nat . If you say the word I 'll take that big mouth Tom Carter an '  --  ( He makes a violent gesture . ) NAT No , Will . He right . Maybe I am jus ' a man , maybe I ai n't got the power -- maybe I ai n't no Messiah like I thought . WILL But you is , Nat , you is . I know you is . You couldna cured me less'n you was ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder if I really is ? WILL What you gon ' do ? NAT God 'll tell me . ( He looks up into the flashing skies . There is a loud rumble . ) Leave me , Will . He wants to talk to me . ( WILL starts out . ) WILL ( Turning back ) Nat , you bes ' come now befo ' the storm break --  NAT ( Commanding ) Go ahead , Will . ( WILL hesitates , then turns and disappears up the path . NAT crosses and kneels before a tree stump and clasps his hands in front of him . ) They didn ' believe me , Lord . They didn ' believe me . But don ' blame them , Lord , they ain ' know no better . They will believe me . I 'll make ' em believe somehow wit ' yo ' he'p . Cause I need yo ' he'p , Lord . Ca n't do nothin ' wit'out yo ' he'p , ca n't do nothin ' . What 's I 'm gon na do , Jesus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' sump'n I could do fo ' to prove yo ' word . ( He begins to moan . ) What I 'm gon na do ? What I 'm gon na do ? ( He stops moaning and rises . ) If I 'm the Messiah , I mus ' got the power to work me a miracle like in the ol ' days . But what ? ( He sees a stick . ) That stick . I 'll turn it into a snake . ( He grasps the stick in his hands . ) But s'pose I ca n't ? ( He hesitates . ) Gimmie the power , Lord , gim me the power . Turn this stick into a serpent so I can know fo ' true that you wit ' me . ( A pause , then he throws the stick to the ground . ) ( Another pause , and he approaches it warily . He watches it for a moment then touches it with his foot . ) It ain ' change . It still ain ' nothin ' but a stick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got ta . Can ' be no Messiah if I ca n't pass no miracle . Snakes is a sign of the devil anyway . That 's how come it didn ' work . Couldn ' bring no devil here . I 'll try sump'n else . ( He picks up the stick and approaches a tree . ) Wine is the blood of Jesus . I wants to drink my Jesus ' blood . I want the blood that 's in that tree ! ( He strikes the tree viciously . The wind begins to rise and there is a louder peal of thunder . ) What that ? Soun ' like somebody in the swamp . ( He listens . There is a blinding crash of lightning . Nat falls to his knees terrified . ) What 's the matter , Lord ? Why you angry wit ' me ? Has I done wrong ?

NAT remains alone . When they have gone , he picks up his hat and rifle and looks heavenward . ) NAT See you later , Lord . We 's on our way . ( He flops on the hat and walks out rapidly . ) Fade out The music rises and continues until the next scene. @x Dawn two days later . In the background a dusty , red clay road comin out of the woods . At this point the road divides , one spur going to the right , the other to the left . The sky is just beginning to show gray . After a moment NAT enters followed by the others . All carry rifles and some pewter jugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HARK is with them now . At a signal from NAT they halt . NAT This look like a good place . Let 's res ' here . ( The men throw themselves on the ground panting heavily , but NAT begins to walk about , glancing first up the road down which they have come then up the road to the right , then to the left . Meanwhile the men begin passing one of the jugs around . ) NELSON Sho ' , God , wish I had sump 'm t'eat . This water goin ' through me like a sieve . SAM Nat take care of that in a minute . NELSON I s'pose we eat at the nex plantation . Be ' bout time for breakfast when we drap in on ' em . God , I 'm tired . But look at Nat will you . He ain ' phased at all . JACK If he 'd let me have a swallow of this likker here ( Indicating a jug on his back ) I would n't need no food . p. 56 NELSON Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little while . Hey , Tom , you think he min ' ? TOM Don ' know . Ask him . NELSON Believe I will . ( To NAT who approaches . ) Nat , we awful hungry .

These two jugs wouldn ' go ' roun ' mo'n twice . WILL Let ' em have it , Nat . They ain ' no good on a empty belly . NAT Don ' seem right . Seem like we 'd be bespoilin ' our mission . ( He sighs . ) But there ain ' no other way , I guess . Guess the Lord won ' min this once . Go ahead -- but none fo ' me . ( JACK takes a long swig then passes the first jug to another . Each man takes a good deep draught in his turn before passing it on . ) An ' min ' you don ' let it go to yo ' head . HENRY Lord God , I ca n't believe it I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

We git enough arms fo ' ' em we gon free ev'y slave in Virginia ! Ca n't nobody or nothin ' stop us now . p. 58 JACK Amen ! HENRY I was tryin ' to keep the number of plantations in my head but I los ' the count somewhere . NAT Let 's see , firs ' there was Marse Travis -- then the Francis plantation .

How ' bout it ? WILL Sounds fine , " white boy " , sounds fine . ( A pause ) SAM What 's the matter , Tom ? Still worrin ' ? TOM Some . But mostly I was sonderin ' what Henrietta doin ' ? Waitin ' fo ' me to come home , I reckon . p. 63 SAM ( Drunk ) Waitin ' hell . Probably celebratin ' her freedom in Marse Travis ' bed . ( The others laugh . ) TOM ( Bristling ) What you mean ?

TOM ( Pushing him aside and grabbing JACK by the shirt ) What the hell 's this I hear ' bout you an ' my Henrietta ? p. 64 JACK Leggo my shirt , Tom Carter . How the hell I know what you hear ? TOM You heard me -- what this ' bout you an ' my Henrietta ? JACK Goddamit , take yo ' han ' offa my shirt !

TOM ( Pushing back the proffered jug ) You ain ' talkin ' yo ' way outa this . This is strictly between me and you . ( He grabs JACK 'S shirt again . ) WILL ( Rising ) Cut it out , Tom . JACK Tom , you gone crazy ? TOM Yeah , crazy mad . Crazy mad to fin ' out what you been up to wit ' Henrietta . JACK You kinda got things mixed up . I ai n't been up to nothin ' . Hell I ca n't he'p it if Henrietta like me more'n she do you . ( There are wild shouts from the men . Taunting insulting shouts . TOM is stung , shocked , bewildered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at JACK 'S throat. ) p. 65 TOM Damn you ! ( JACK is taken by surprise at the fury of TOM 'S attack but being the larger and the stronger of the men quickly recovers . TOM reaches for his knife . As he pulls it out JACK grabs his wrist . ) JACK So you want to fight , dirty , huh ? ( JACK forces the knife viciously inward against TOM 'S ribs . He screams out in pain . ) HARK Look out , Jack , you killin ' him . ( JACK however , has become a madman and does not hear the warning . Suddenly , TOM collapses . The men pull JACK off and forcibly restrain him . ) WILL Hol ' on , Jack , hol ' on . NELSON This boy gon ' crazy . HARK ( Bending over TOM ) He ain ' breathin ' . WILL What you say ? HARK He ain ' breathin ' .  - -  I 'm afraid he's --  SAM Dead ? ( HARK nods . A shocked silence falls over the group . Then NAT enters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( He sees TOM 'S prostrate body and stops . ) Who done that ? ( The men release JACK and draw back from him . ) Jack Reese . ( JACK nods . ) Why ? p. 66 JACK I 'm sorry , Nat . NAT ( His anger rising ) You sorry ? ( NAT advances to JACK and slaps him viciously with the palm of his hand on both sides of his face . JACK staggers backwards . ) Liquor . That 's what done it . ( He grabs the jugs and sends them crashing into the distance . ) That stuff is the devil 's poison , jus ' like I said . Look what its done to you . ( JACK starts to protest . ) Done turned you into wild beasts -- killin ' each other . JACK I 'm sorry , Nat . NAT Too late to be sorry , now . Tom 's dead . ( Pause ) I don ' like this . It might turn God ' gainst us . Might put a hex on us . JACK I lost my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repent -- all of you . Down on yo ' knees . ( As they kneel a distant baying of hounds comes into the clearing . ) Lord , fo'give this man --  these men --  HARK Nat , listen --  ( He half rises . ) NAT ( Ignoring the interruption ) Forgive them fo ' sinnin '  --  SAM I heard that sound befo ' . p. 67 HARK It 's blood hounds ! NELSON Blood hounds ? ( Everyone is on his feet now including NAT . ) HENRY Them 's patyrollers ! They 's after us ! WILL But how come ? Nat , how come ? You say God 'll strike ' em dead . NAT That killin ' done put a hex on us . HARK They 's comin ' fas ' , Nat . What we gon ' do ? NAT Scatter . Ca n't bunch together no mo ' . Stay low ' til yo ' sure you in the clear , then head fo ' the swamp . I 'll meet you there . Now git ! ( The group breaks up rapidly . The men gather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sound of the hounds is now very close . NAT is the last to leave . ) VOICE There goes one of ' em now ! ( NAT plunges off as a volley is fired . ) VOICE Did you get him ? Where 'd he go ? ANOTHER VOICE I do n't know . But I think I nicked him . He wo n't get far . Let 's go . ( The baying of the hounds rises again and continues to rise as the lights fade. ) @x Three days later . Late afternoon . The scene is a meadow near the edge of a woods . On a hilly rise in the background is a corn crib half-filled with corn . To one side is a well . The music fades as the lights come up and NAT is seen at the well drinking from the bucket . After a couple of swallows he sighs , sits down , and leans against the well , removing the perennial hat to fan himself . NAT Musta throwed ' em clear off . Ain ' heard them hounds fo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Got to make tracks fo ' the swamp though . The others be gittin ' there an ' wonderin ' what to do . They be los ' witout me . ( Pause ) But what I can ' understan ' is why this happen befo ' we free all the slaves ? ( Stops fanning ) You s'pose God won ' ready fo ' us to be free ? Maybe that won ' really the sign . What did Tom say ? Jedus did n't kill nobody . ( Pause ) Naw -- naw . ' Cause God done tol ' me . I heard Him plain as day mo 'n once . He say free yo ' people . An ' that means killin ' . Then how come ? ( pause ) Mus ' be punishment fo sump'n . Fo ' what though ? ( Pause ) We ain ' done nothin ' wrong less'n it be that killin ' of TOM . But they was already after us when that happen . They musta been . ( Pause ) Naw . This jus ' a trial like the way God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a trial . We still gon ' be free . ( He stops again puzzled . ) But jes ' the same --  ( He hears someone thrashing through the underbrush . ) Somebody comin ' . I got to take cover . ( He scrambles to his feet and hurries to the crib and climbs into it covering himself with corn . The thrashing grows louder and after a pause WILL FRANCIS stumbles on and falls prostrate near the well . He has been wounded and is bleeding profusely. ) p. 69 WILL ( Gasping ) Can ' run no further -- can ' run no further . Can ' he'p it if they do catch me . NAT ( Rising from the crib and jumping to the ground ) Will ! WILL Who that ? ( Sees NAT ) Nat ! Where you come from ? NAT ( Kneeling beside him ) Will , you been hit . WILL Got careless a little ways back , Nat . NAT I 'll git you some water . ( He turns to go . ) An ' fix you right up . WILL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His voice is weaker . NAT stops . ) Can ' las ' much longer , no how . NAT ( Returning ) Will ! WILL Done painted the bushes with blood fo ' ten miles . ( Pause ) Listen , Nat . You better git outa here fas ' . Patyrollers ain ' far behind me . NAT Not wit'out you , big boy . WILL Don ' worry ' bout me . White folks ain ' gon bother me no mo ' . NAT ( Protesting ) But you ain ' gon die . p. 70 WILL Got ta die some time , Nat . Might as well be now . Only I sho ' did n't want to die no slave . ( Pause ) Hadn ' been fo ' you , Nat , I still be a hateful ol ' sinner . Now I leas ' got a chance a talkin ' to Saint Peter . NAT Will -- I --  WILL Listen , Nat . They 's all dead -- All but me an ' you . NAT Dead ? All of them ? No , Will . They ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ? ' Cause I hear the patyrollers talkin ' . That 's how come they come to git me .

NAT God gon ' take care me -- and you too . p. 71 WILL ( Weakly ) Reckon He do that , Nat , seein ' how you been ' pointed to free us .

Soothe his pain , Jesus , make him well again . ( The hounds begin baying . ) He been a good worker , Lord , a good worker in yo ' church . If he strayed from the path , I asks fo ' giveness fo ' him since he ain ' got the strength himse'f . Amen . ( Turns to WILL ) Now , Will , that make ev'ything all right . ( WILL does not answer . ) Will ! Will ! ( After a pause unbelievingly ) The Lord ain ' hear me . I done failed again . Why is all this happen to me ? What 's I done wrong ? ( He hears the baying for the first time , and he turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( He puts his hat on. ) @x Several weeks later , the swamp early in the morning . It is now early fall and the multicolored leaves weave a gay pattern around the tree stumps . Occasionally the leaves are blown about by the wind . The music is distant , plaintive , suggestive of NAT 'S loneliness and isolation . NAT sits alone in the center of the clearing . His hat is set at the same jaunty angle . His face is haggard and worn , his body thin , and his clothes are in tatters . Everything about him suggests defeat but he still tries to carry it off . NAT ( Rising ) I can ' stay here no longer -- jus ' ca n't . My belly is bustin ' wit ' hunger . A man can ' live wit ' out food . C'un Lou promise to bring me sump'n once a week but she ai n't showed up in days . She dead , too , I reckon . ( Pause ) I seem like the Lord done lef ' me . Now why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nat Turner . The Lord is always wit ' you . ( Pause ) But how come He don ' talk to me no mo ' ? How come I livin ' like this ?

( Shakes his head . ) Feel kin ' of weak like . That 's ' cause you ain ' had nothin ' in yo ' belly fo ' so long . ( He rises . ) Got to see what 's in the traps today . Mighta caught sump'n . Won ' nothin ' in there yesterday or the day befo ' or the day befo ' that . ( He shakes his head again . ) Feel awful sick in the stomach , too . But I can ' even throw up .

Somebody in the Bible git sent off into the woods an ' come outa it all right . ( Pauses ) Now who was that ? ( Pauses ) Can ' recollect . ( Rubs his forehead . ) Can ' recollect nothin ' . ( Pause ) Ain ' gon be much of a " Messiah " if I can ' tell what 's in the Bible . ( A pause then the sound of someone plodding heavily through the brush . NAT listens . ) They done foun ' me .

C'UN LOU ( Shaking his head ) I do n't know , Nat . They 's scaired to death . ( Pause ) Po ' , dumb , ignorant niggers .
