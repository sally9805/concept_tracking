The Council . which acts as a clearing house for new inventions that may have a war application , has forwarded more than of this number to the armed services for study ' and possible adaptation . Those that have been adopted and arc in actual use today are numbered in two figures . This was revealed . in an interview . by Colonel L. B. Lent , chief engineer of the Council , who was here yesterday for a meeting of the group . - The land mine locator is a good example of a device submitted by an amateur inventor . Colonel Lent said .

His avocation was agriculture , Colonel Stiles said . Seeking a plant that would be useful in preventing soil erosion . he hit on milkweed , which has roots almost as deep as the aboveground plant . Dr. Burkman went a step fukher and developed two machines . one to set the - seeds out and another to pick the pods off the plant . These machines made it economic to harvest the milkweed and paved the way for further development . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and helped get Dr. Burkman financial aid from the Government . One of the most important products derived from milkweed is a material that 111 substituting for kapok in life preservers and flying suits . It 's a good insulator against cold and is water repellant . After the war , we wo n't need Java kapok , Col. Lent said . The milkweed pod is also being used to produce a rubber latex , the stalk fibres make a good paper and the Milk can be spun into thread , he adoed . At present prices . Col. Lent said , farmers could make $100 an acre from growing milkweed . The number of inventions received by the Council parallels the war crises .
