txt Those Drinking Birds ALAN DEWITT , pg . 22 Letters to The Times Those Drinking Birds To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your heading " Perhaps Atomic Energy " in answer to " One Who Is Puzzled " over the long-billed " blackbird that drinks and stops and drinks and stops all day long , " in the issue of Dec. 30 , is , in a sense , correct . However , a more down-to-earth explanation of this phenomenon is as follows : The wet head of the bird causes methyl chloride vapor in the head to condense . This , in turn , forces the methyl chloride in the tail to flow through a tube into the head , completing the forward movement of the bird 's beak into the water . As the ( vapor ) pressure is equalized , the methyl chloride flows back into the tail , causing the bird to become erect again , but since his beak is wet , the above process will be repeated as long as there is water , or alcohol , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Studies , Brooklyn Technical High School Brooklyn , N.
