When , in speaking of the forthcoming motion-picture version , he says : " The conclusion of the scenario  --  like that of the play  --  is that a man of conviction should devote himself to his wife and leave politics alone .

Nobody can afford to be out of politics . " The point the play makes is that every citizen of the United States should not leave politics alone but take a vital and responsible interest in it .
