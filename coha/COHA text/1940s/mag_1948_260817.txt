When Alger Hiss challenged , Whittaker Chambers to repeat in public his accusation that Hiss had been a Communist , Chambers took him up on it . Two nights later , on the radio , he repeated the charge , in effect challenging Hiss to sue him for libel or slander ( TIME , Sept. 6 ) . Last week Hiss took Chambers ' dare , filed a $50,000 suit in Baltimore 's Federal Court , charged that Chambers ' statements were " untrue , false and defamatory . " Said Chambers : " I welcome Mr. Hiss 's daring suit . . . But I do not believe that Mr. Hiss or anybody else can use the means of justice to defeat the ends of justice . "
