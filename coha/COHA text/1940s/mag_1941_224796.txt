Manhattan 's Metropolitan Opera , in its that-ain't-haydays , used to put on a U. S. opera almost every year . None was ever good enough to stay put . A typical one was a 1913 number about the swashbuckling , sword-nosed French poet of the 17th Century , Cyrano de Bergerac . Its better-than-average libretto was blank-versified out of Edmond Rostand 's play by the late William J. Henderson , musicritic of the New York Sun . Its workmanlike score was put together , out of a wide knowledge of Wagner and other masters , by a conductor who had been toonering along since 1885 - Walter Damrosch . Cyrano de Bergerac had five performances , was then forgotten by most people . But not by Conductor Damrosch . <P> Last week white-haired , cherubicund Dr. Damrosch lovingly conducted a new version of Cyrano , which he had polished up during the past three years . The opera was given in concert form in Carnegie Hall , with soloists and full orchestra . The long performance gave Conductor Damrosch perceptible pleasure : it was practically a celebration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critics behaved like good children . Nearest to the mark ( that Cyrano was appallingly dull ) was Edward O'Gorman of the Post : " . . . a score . . . that the average listener might not journey far to hear , but one that he would probably like once he got there , and remember with pleasure if he did n't stay too long . " <P> In entering his 80th year , Walter Damrosch had better to boast of than his operas ( he wrote three others , The Scarlet Letter , The Dove of Peace , The Man Without a Country ) . No man living has one more for good music in the U. S. than he . Born of a famed conductor father ( Leopold Damrosch ) in Breslau , Germany , Walter Damrosch took his own opera company barnstorming in the U. S. , toured with the old New York Symphony to towns which had never heard a concert . Shrewd , levelheaded , anything but temperamental , he could take it in his stride when a snow-heavy trap door rattled and banged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did one night in Utica , N. Y. ) , or when he found himself conducting on the strippers ' runway in some cramped burlesque house . He was not above giving the Pathtique Symphony the fastest performance on record so that the orchestra could catch its train . <P> Walter Damrosch has seldom been regarded as a great interpreter of music , but he made good programs , played new music , helped along such composers as George Gershwin . A man of immense energy and many friends , Dr. Damrosch still puts in an eight-hour work day . As NBC 's musical counsel honoris causa , he has worked at a steady job for 13 years : NBC 's Music Appreciation Hour . Every Friday some 7,000,000 youngsters , most of them in public-school classes , await with pencils and notebooks the mellow baritone of nice old Dr. Damrosch : " Good afternoon , my dear children !
