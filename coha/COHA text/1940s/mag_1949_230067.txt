<P> " Everyone knows this Parliament is dead , " cried Winston Churchill in the House of Commons last week . <P> The four-year-old Parliament had just disposed of the last big item on Labor 's 1945 election program : nationalization of the British steel industry . The House of Commons and the House of Lords , long at loggerheads over the steel bill ( TIME , June 21 , 1948 ) , had worked out a compromise . The lords agreed to pass the bill without further ado if the government would not make it effective until after the 1950 general election . " Vesting day " for the steel industry was set for Jan. 1 , 1951 . Thus , if the Tories win , they can repeal the law before any steel plants are actually taken over by the government . <P> Churchill bluntly challenged Prime Minister Clement Attlee to send Parliament home and set the election for early in 1950 . Attlee , slumped on the government front bench and looking funereal in his black coat and neat striped trousers , seemed not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be held earlier than Labor had planned . Best guess : February or March .
