Everybody knew that Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis ' contract as Baseball Commissioner might not be renewed . He had done much for baseball , earned the deep respect of both players and owners ; but he was hardheaded and crusty , had stepped on a lot of toes during his quarter-century of rule . He was also old and sick . Club owners and sportswriters alike speculated about his successor . Then suddenly , a fortnight ago , the Judge took a turn for the worse . A joint committee of the National and American Leagues rushed to Chicago , solemnly recommended him for another seven years in office . It was a kindly gesture . Last week , baseball 's 78-year-old czar died of a heart ailment . <P> Kingpin . Kenesaw Mountain Landis almost always wore a scowl , never pulled a punch . When he became the $42,500-a-year kingpin of organized baseball in 1920 , the game reeked of the Black Sox scandal . He promptly decreed that the eight Chicago players involved , although acquitted by a civil court , be barred from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruled supreme . <P> As professional baseball 's one-man judge , jury and police force , Judge Landis had the power to cancel a World Series , banish an owner or manager , void any deal at any time . Truculent , profane , razor-sharp , he had only to look down his nose to make everybody hop . Most times they did n't like it , but his kind of tyrannical power was good for the game , and baseballers knew it . <P> The last of the Commissioner 's major decrees splashed into print a year ago . Violently opposed to all forms of gambling , the silver-haired Judge banned W. D. Cox , owner of the Philadelphia Phillies , from baseball for life because Cox bet on his own team . Two years before , Judge Landis blackballed Bing Crosby 's bid for the Boston Braves because Bing owned a racing stable . In 1940 , he waved his wand and made free agents of 92 players who had signed Detroit Tigers contracts ( because Detroit used its farm clubs to " cover up " players ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , club owners growled and groused , threatening rebellion . On the few occasions when they failed to turn meek in due course , the Commissioner calmly threatened to tear up his contract . <P> Although few knew it , Judge Landis had his own peculiar sense of humor . One favorite story : he and his wife , Winifred , were getting out of a cab to attend the Chicago opera ; observing how slippery the sidewalk was , the Judge called to his wife , " Be careful , dear , or you 'll break your goddam neck . " But stubbornness was his best-known quality , and it never served him-or baseball-better than it did two years ago . When the service draft hit major-league rosters and some club owners wondered about giving up baseball for the duration , the Judge doggedly insisted that , unless some law prevented putting nine men on the field , the game would go on . <P> Three for One ? Who would take his place ? Jim Farley was a much-mentioned name . But the best bet was that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-man advisory council would take over temporarily : American League President William Harridge , National League President Ford Frick , Landis ' secretary , Leslie O'Connor . It might well take three men to fill the Judge 's shoes .
