Dr. Lo Lung-chi , information chief of China 's bitterly anti-Kuomintang Democratic League , felt that he was being watched , and he had his reasons . One evening recently police knuckles rapped on the gates of the Democratic League headquarters . It was just a routine check on residence registration , they said . Police had long been interested in the building ; it was the property ( and had once been the headquarters ) of the Communist Party of China . <P> " Ai Ya ! " - the Box ! After the police departed , Dr. Lo &; friends burned confidential documents . Among the items tossed on the fire was a fairly complete list of Kuomintang secret agents . Interestingly enough , this document was retrieved from the flames at a favorable moment by another Kuomintang secret agent ( his name obviously not on the list ) who had wormed his way into the Democratic League and happened to be serving as a member of the burning party . <P> Early next morning a Democratic League man hopped into the green Chrysler sedan inherited last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Soviet Embassy . He entered the Embassy with an interesting box , came back to his car without it . Fledgling plainclothesmen got their ears scorched when they reported his visit . " Ai ya ! " groaned a Chinese detective superintendent , " Why did n't you pretend a collision , yell , stop the car , claim , the box-anything to get it ? " <P> Last week the Nanking Government finally outlawed the Democratic League , for " complicity with Chinese Communists in their armed rebellion against the state . " <P> " Fellow-Traveling Rump ? " What was the Democratic League ? Even a good many Chinese were not sure . Once it had been the middle-party hope of a large number of Chinese liberals . Then the league 's right wing ( the Young China Party ) had withdrawn , and the center ( the Social Democrats ) had been expelled . Chinese liberals now said that what was left looked like " a fellow-traveling rump . " <P> Among the Government 's charges against the league : <P> League Member Lo Pin-chi was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Shensi , Szechwan and overseas had organized armed revolt . <P> In more than a year of politics , the league had consistently followed the Communist line . Examples : sponsoring " Anti-American Month " and " U.S. Troops Get Out of China Week . " <P> Nervous Dr. Lo drove not to the Soviets but to the residence of U.S. Ambassador J. Leighton Stuart ( followed , this time , by a jeepful of plainclothesmen ) . Lo received assurance that Ambassador Stuart had already spoken to the Government in behalf of moderate measures . <P> The Government decided against blanket arrest of league members . Instead , individuals charged with specific aid to the Communists would be arrested . At week 's end , Dr. Lo was back at home , still with that feeling of being watched .
