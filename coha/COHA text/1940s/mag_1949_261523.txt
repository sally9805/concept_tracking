Deep Freeze <P> Sir : <P> <P> I have just finished reading " The Deep Freeze Set " TIME , Aug. 22 . <P> I wonder how our forefathers would have reacted to such philandering of the trust placed in their public servants . . . ? <P> <P> LEONARD A. MAGNUSON <P> Jamestown , N.Y . <P> <P> Sir : <P> There is no doubt that Major General Vaughan has " used the White House as a means of playing low-grade county-courthouse politics , " but the responsibility for this . . . rests not with Vaughan but with his boss , who , incidentally , is no innocent babe in the political woods . . . <P> RICHARD E. CROCKFORD Portland , Me . <P> Sir : <P> <P> The " five-percenters " deserve all the condemnation that is being heaped upon them . But so far I have seen no criticism of the men who paid the bribes . Are they not also to blame ? Is it not indicative of the greed and grab which pervades much of our American business ? <P> <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Line <P> Sir : <P> <P> Your Aug. 22 article on Jos Ortega y Gasset 's description of the evolution of art was read with interest . But I am afraid you adopt too much of a defeatist attitude in your last sentence : " It looked as if modern art must be the end of the line . " <P> Many others will agree , I 'm sure , with the idea that as long as the evolution progresses from the solid body to the space between the eye and the object , and from there to the back of the mind , the next step after modern art will be taken by a man with a hole in his head . <P> <P> W.
