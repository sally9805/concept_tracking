King George had entered a filly named Angelola in the big race , but Queen Elizabeth did n't give the royal entry a prayer . Said she : " I think I should back My Love . " So did most of the 400,000 fans lining the track at Doncaster , England , for last week 's St. Leger ( rhymes with quaint ledger ) . My Love was the 7-to-4 favorite ; the Aga Khan 's mahogany three-year-old had already won the Epsom Derby and the French Grand Prix . <P> Only one American-bred horse was competing in the historic race , first run in 1776 : Black Tarquin , * owned by the chairman of New York 's Jockey Club , William Woodward . In the Derby , Black Tarquin had finished eighth , and most bettors figured that he lacked staying powers for the mile-and-three-quarters St. Leger . The American colt , ridden by Australian Jockey Edgar Britt , settled down well to the rear , made no move until the stretch . Then , with only two furlongs to go , he put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an outsider , by a length and a half . In sixth place : My Love , just ahead of Angelola . <P> Owner Woodward was richer by 15,368 ( $61,472 ) , biggest purse in British turf history . <P> <P> *Named , explains his owner , " after the fellow Sextus Tarquinius who raped Lucrece. "
