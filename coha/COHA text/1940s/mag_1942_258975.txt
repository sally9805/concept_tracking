On the grounds of Missouri 's Capitol at Jefferson City repose three old cannon from bygone wars . Every time that Ralph Coghlan , a ruddy , owlish man who breathes fire and snorts the editorial page of the famed St. Louis Post-Dispatch , thought about them it made him mad . He thought they belonged on the nation 's scrap pile . But Missouri 's earnest , toothy Governor Forrest C. Donnell said he could not prove that the State owned the cannon , therefore could not give them away . This made Ralph Coghlan even madder . <P> Last week he took matters into his own hands . While planting some locust trees in his garden he discussed the cannon with a tree surgeon , one Sidney Stearns . Ralph Coghlan said he was " very serious " about wanting those cannon on the scrap pile . Upshot : Arborist Stearns agreed to get a friend and remove the cannon ; Editor Coghlan agreed to pay the expenses . Further upshot : when Stearns and . friend tried to uproot the cannon they were arrested . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolver , a full can of gasoline and a sixth tire in Stearns 's truck . <P> In its first account of the incident , the Post-Dispatch ran a kidding story , dubbed Stearns " the General , " published his picture wiggling the " V-for-Victory " sign . Finally it had to admit Editor Coghlan 's part in the prank . This moved Governor Donnell into action . He ordered Editor Coghlan arrested for larceny . Righteously the Governor said : " This is outrageous . . . filled with a spirit of anarchy and disrespect for law . . . . The law is going to be enforced , the Post-Dispatch notwithstanding . " <P> It was not the first time that Ralph Coghlan 's Irish temper had got him into the news . Three years ago he got so editorially inflamed about a raw acquittal in a St. Louis courtroom , he found himself , charged with contempt of court . This brought a 20-day jail sentence ( later reversed ) . Few months later , when Franklin Roosevelt traded the 50 overage destroyers to Britain , Editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act of War , bought space in New York and Washington papers to advertise his views . <P> This time , caught in a college prank , and an unsuccessful one at that , Editor Coghlan was mum .
