One day last week , the Sacred Cow ( once President Truman 's personal plane ) landed in Athens . Out stepped Secretary of State George Marshall , who had left his wearisome business in Paris to have a look into the even more wearisome business of Greece . Assembled to greet him , plainly a little embarrassed , were U.S. Ambassador Henry F. Grady , U.S. General James A. Van Fleet and Greek Premier Themistocles Sophoulis ( who wore dark glasses despite the day 's grey overcast ) . The Premier remarked that Greece 's fate rested in George Marshall 's strong hands . He might have added that these hands were , as usual , expected to straighten out a sad mess . <P> Last summer , after the Greek army 's victory in the Grammos Mountains , it looked as though the guerrilla power was broken and that only a mopping-up process lay ahead . This month , re-equipped by Greece 's Communist neighbors , the guerrillas made a startling comeback by attacking government positions in the Vitsi Mountains ( TIME , Oct. 11 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to 13% in the Grammos operation , had little appetite for the Vitsi campaign . The guerrillas had a fresh , seemingly unlimited supply of land mines which they were using to the full ; World War II veterans know what intensive mining does to a soldier 's morale . Last month the Greek government sent an S.O.S. to Washington . Its gist : there are actually more guerrillas in Greece now than when the U.S. first started giving aid ; continued U.S. aid is necessary . <P> As George Marshall drove through Athens , the people ( who had not been told of his visit until just before his arrival ) thronged the streets and cried : " Zeto hurrah Marshall ! " He drove to the headquarters of the U.S. military mission - nicknamed the " Temple of Knowledge " by sour Greek officers-for talks with the U.S. staff . To correspondents , U.S. officers explained that no decisive action was possible this year because winter had already come to the mountains in northern Greece . All that could be done was to contain the guerrillas , and prepare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation ... is not completely satisfactory . " <P> While Greeks and Americans tended to blame each other for the " situation , " the truth was that both were faced with a very tough military and political problem : How to destroy an enemy when his base in a " neutral " country is immune from attack ? <P> As George Marshall boarded his plane to return to Paris , a Greek newsman commented : " There goes the wisest statesman who has come to Greece in a long time . He promised nothing-and did n't try to tell us that the situation was fine . "
