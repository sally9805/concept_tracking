In fact , it went to town . <P> The program , it decided , should lead off with the " V for Victory " theme from Beethoven 's Fifth Symphony blown on a trumpet , then fade in with the D Major theme from the Choral Finale of Beethoven 's Ninth ( played by low strings ) . After a break for announcement of the occasion , the orchestra should swing into the complete choral finale . The rest of the program should consist of music from various United Nations : China ; Britain ( represented preferably by German-born Handel 's Hallelujah Chorus ) ; France ( represented in part by Belgian-born Cesar Franck 's Pice Heroique ) ; Russia ( Shostakovich and Tchaikovsky ) ; the U.S. ( America the Beautiful , the old European psalm-tune Old Hundred , Home Sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department further elaborated : " The music should not only represent the outstanding nations , but it should also agree with the spoken words , and make an artistic whole by contrast in mood and tempo .
