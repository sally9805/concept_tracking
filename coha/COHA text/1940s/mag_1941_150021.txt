France 's Henry IV , not a bad politician himself , put it neatly : " I wish that every peasant may have a chicken in his pot on Sundays . " Governor Wilbert Lee ( " Pass the Biscuits , Pappy " ) O'Daniel of Texas , campaigning for re-election last summer , went way beyond Henry . When he spoke at a crossroads , the melodious and hospitable Governor often wound up : " Come down to dinner at the Governor 's mansion some time . . . . " Last week 25,000 Texans took him up on the invitation , trooped to Austin to a barbecue after his inaugural . The inaugural itself was simple-with the Governor requesting more power , fussing about the Legislature as he has for two years , and saluting the heroes of The Alamo as he does well and often in song and speech- but the barbecue that came after it was the biggest feed in Texas history . The Governor 's guests ate 15 steers , one buffalo , several calves and sheep ( in all 17,000 lb. of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3,200 loaves of bread , 6,500 buns , 1,250 lb. of onions , half a ton of potato chips , 6,000 sour pickles , 500 Ib. of cheese . The lemonade alone took 2,000 dozen lemons ; and 900 gallons of coffee went down Texas gullets . <P> The barbecue pit , 50 feet long , was dug in the yard of the Governor 's mansion , in what had once been a rose garden . Sixteen groups dished up the food at the rate of almost 200 plates a minute . The Governor himself had shot the buffalo , from a privately owned Texas herd . ( Said he : " ... They had the whole county out to watch . . . . They were there to laugh when they thought I would miss my shot as the thundering herd of wild buffalo rushed by ... so they had a crack shots-man there to kill the wild beast in case I only hit him and just antagonized him . ... I think I shot the wrong buffalo . . . but I wanted plenty of meat for all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most meat . " ) <P> Over the din of the dinner the Governor 's hillbilly band , masters of The Long Ago , The Tramp 's Mother , and the classic Beautiful Texas , played on the mansion steps . Fifteen women fainted during the serving . Dinner over , the crowd streamed through the mansion , shook hands with the Governor , who gave each handshaker a big Texas grapefruit . One woman fell down and was tromped on ; she became hysterical . Five more women fainted at the reception . Another broke her ankle when she jumped over a hedge . When the barbecue was over , the mansion grounds were covered with a vast litter of gnawed bones , pieces of meat , slices of onion , potato chips , paper napkins , paper plates . Then at night the crowd danced in the street , to the tune of hillbilly bands , by the light of the moon and of colored globes strung across the rear of the Capitol lawn .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
