( See Cover ) <P> Last week was the most successful week of the war in the Southwest Pacific . With the Japs all but cleaned out of the Papuan sector of New Guinea , with the crushing of a Japanese attempt to land new reinforcements , General Douglas MacArthur left the screened veranda of his New Guinea cottage , where he had been since November , and returned to his headquarters in Australia . <P> His first act was to heap honors on his high command : Distinguished Service Crosses to twelve of his ranking officers ( six Americans , six Australians ) . One of them , Lieut . General Robert L. Eichelberger , was revealed as the U.S. field commander in the Papuan campaign . In an outpouring of long-kept secrets , General MacArthur also revealed the identity of his ground forces in the campaign : parts of the 6th and 7th Australian divisions , and of the American 41st ( Oregon , Washington , Montana National Guard ) and 32nd ( from Wisconsin and Michigan ) . <P> Said General MacArthur : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , operating under difficulties rarely if ever surpassed in a campaign , has earned my highest praise and commendation . . . . To the American Fifth Air Force and the Royal Australian Air Force no commendation could be too great . . . . They have set new horizons for the air conduct of the war . <P> " To Almighty God , " concluded General MacArthur , " I give thanks for that guidance which has brought us to this success in our great crusade . His is the honor , the power and the glory , forever , Amen . " <P> Hammer the Hammer . But last week belonged to the airmen . The center of the week 's action focused first on a drab sedan which lurched over the pocked and pitted track that winds from Jackson airdrome to Port Moresby . The thick red dust of New Guinea blurred its windows , but not the three white stars on its license plate . Spying the stars , half-naked troops , Australian and American , grinned and threw casual salutes . One of their favorite brass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kenney , Commanding General of Allied Air Forces , Southwest Pacific Area , and commander , Fifth U.S. Air Force . <P> The grins would have become cheers had the troops known what scrub-headed General Kenney was saying at that moment : " Good , Whitey ! Let 's smear ' em tomorrow . " <P> " Whitey " was his deputy commander , Brigadier General Ennis C. Whitehead . " Em " was the Japanese concentration at Rabaul . Rabaul Peninsula lies at the northern tip of New Britain , 480 air miles from Moresby . It looks not unlike the cocked hammer of a pistol , and like a pistol the Japanese have pointed it at the Allies in the Southwest Pacific . Kenney 's planes had hit it before , but not in the strength he wanted . Now Whitehead had met him at the airdrome with the news that his strength was mustered : two squadrons of Flying Fortresses , one of B-24 Liberators . At last Kenney was ready to hammer the hammer . <P> For exactly 25 years George Kenney has carried in his fob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oracle he invariably consults before embarking on momentous projects . In the rocking , dusty sedan he plucked them out at random . They showed six-one , a natural . He faced them toward his aide , able , beady-eyed Captain Clarence " Kip " Chase .
