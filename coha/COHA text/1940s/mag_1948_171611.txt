The cockpit of a big modern airliner is a nightmare of instruments , switches , knobs , push buttons and warning lights . They crowd for attention in front of the pilot and copilot . They encrust the walls , drip from the roof like stalactites and overflow into the cubbyhole where the flight engineer sits . On a Boeing Strato-liner , there are 598 gadgets to watch . The three-man crew must know what each one is , where it is , and how to use it instantly . In an emergency , a few seconds of fumbling may mean a crash . <P> Training by actual flight is expensive ( over $500 an hour for a four-engine airliner ) , and not too satisfactory , either ( as one airline spokesman put it delicately : " We hesitate to institute disaster conditions in a real , $1,500,000 airplane " ) . <P> Last week at Caldwell , N.J. , Curtiss-Wright and Pan American Airways demonstrated an elaborate training device , the biggest and best of its kind , which can simulate both " disaster conditions " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not fly or even move . But crewmen shut in its cockpit ( a copy of the cockpit in Pan Am 's new Boeing Clippers ) experience nearly all the horrors that can overtake a pilot . They are at the mercy of an unseen instructor who can " simulate " violent weather and faithless machinery . <P> By electronic trickery he can make the controls and instruments in the cockpit behave as if a fuel line had clogged , or as if a deadly crust of ice were forming on the wings and tail surfaces . He can knock out the radio or devil it with static . He can kindle a fire in the baggage compartment or chill the passengers by knocking out the cabin heating system . <P> In a takeoff , the sound of roaring engines is heard , coughing a little at first with startling realism . The cabin vibrates convincingly . The monotonous beat of the guiding radio beam throbs in the pilot 's headset . If the instructor chooses to start a fire in an engine , an alarm bell blasts , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The crew must know instantly how to bring in a crippled plane , be able to find the runway with a blind-landing system . Even the squeak of tires is heard as the wheels hit the concrete on a landing . The crewmen come back from their simulated flight in a sweat that is not simulated .
