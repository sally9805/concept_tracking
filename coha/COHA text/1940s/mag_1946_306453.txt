( See Cover ) <P> As the Great Ham stalked into Judge T. Alan Goldsborough 's courtroom last Tuesday morning , he suspected something of what was in store for him . Drawn Venetian blinds excluded the sun and gave the oak-paneled chamber the fashionable decorum of a high-class caf . It took the judge about 40 minutes to overrule all defense objections and accept the Government 's findings of fact . Would Mr. Lewis be permitted to speak ? He would , said the judge , and Lewis rose , clutching three typewritten sheets of paper . <P> In the dim light he looked ashen grey . His eyes were sunken , his skin flabby , his once thick mop of hair was grey , dry and scraggly . He looked his full 66 years . But his mien , as usual , was impassive . <P> The Bridgehead . Early in the battle , he had taken a position where all of organized labor could view him , where all of organized labor would have to applaud him , whether it liked him or not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse . The court had merely ordered him to postpone-until the legal questions of his coal contract could be adjudicated-an action which would do the country great injury . This was the order he had defied . The order was the first step to an injunction , a word which labor mortally hated and feared . So on the bridgehead of Injunction Horatius took his stand . <P> " The history of the labor injunction prior to 1932 is a sordid one , " he read that Tuesday morning , in the weary tones of a tired preacher who knows his text by heart . The Norris-LaGuardia Act , he said , barred such injunctions as the court had issued ; and-looking straight at the judge - the act was written " in plain language which any intelligent citizen can understand . <P> " On Oct. 21 this union asked for conferences to discuss our grievances . Outstanding among these grievances which cries aloud for immediate adjustment is the deadly , brutal 54-hour work week underground in American coal mines . " * <P> He spoke , he said , as president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of A.F.L. Did he imply the threat of a general strike ? He could not permit , he said , letting his voice rise a bit , " the ugly recrudescence of government by injunction . " Labor must stand on its " constitutional rights . " <P> Judge Goldsborough wiped his glasses , hooked them back on his nose , rocked ruminatively back &; forth on his red-leather chair . Then he ruled that Lewis and the United Mine Workers , notwithstanding , were in contempt of court . Lewis would return the next day , the judge ordered , to receive his sentence . <P> In the days of maneuvering , Lewis had talked to men like his old friend &; enemy Harry Moses , of U.S. Steel , and Cyrus Eaton , of the Chesapeake &; Ohio Railroad ; it was gradually borne in on him that Harry Truman might be calling his bluff . Eaton was anxious to bring about negotiations ; Moses was willing-on his terms . But Harry Truman was adamant . And now the impossible had happened . Lewis had actually been convicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' feet .
