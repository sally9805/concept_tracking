While total war flames around Eire , Irish archeologists have peacefully dug into their country 's prehistory . In 1934 some 30 excavation projects were set going by the Irish Government , to make work for laborers as well as to illuminate Eire 's antiquity . Last week , with the 1940 season wound up at Lough Gur in County Limerick , word came from there that a continuous chain of human habitations had been traced back-through the Norman and Viking invasions , through the Bronze Age to the Stone Age-to the oldest known village site in Eire . It was dated at 2400 B.C. <P> Trophies at Lough Gur came from all ages : stone axes , flint weapons and tools , a bronze bracelet and bronze pins , bone combs , glass beads , hand mills for grinding grain , whetstones , Viking silver , and , according to the diggers , the finest ceremonial circle of druid stones in Eire . In charge were Professor Sean P. O'Riordain of Cork 's University College and his assistant lecturer , Miss Caitriona MacLeod , a witty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typical Stone Age house which they unearthed , 32 feet long by 18 wide , had walls of stone and wood , a thatched roof supported by rows , of wooden posts , a long living room with a fireplace and aisles off the side for sleeping . <P> Bronze Age pottery discovered at Lough Gur is the first direct evidence in Eire of the archeologically famed " Beaker people , " so named for the drinking vessels which they buried with their dead . Some archeologists believe the tall , husky , brachycephalic ( roundheaded ) Beaker people came into Europe from the steppes of southern Russia , where burials resembling the Beaker graves have been found . <P> But the earliest known inhabitants of Ireland were people from Spain and some wanderers from northeastern Europe . The old Irish were smart . They worked metals a long time before the Stone Age ended in Britain .
