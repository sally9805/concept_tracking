Federal Security Administrator Oscar Ross Ewing , lawyer and formerly assistant chairman of the Democratic National Committee , had been asked by President Truman to prescribe a ten-year health plan for the nation . Last May Ewing , whose job includes supervision of the U.S. Public Health Service , called a National Health Assembly to get some advice from doctors and other experts ( TIME , May 17 ) . The assembly agreed that the U.S. needs some kind of medical insurance , but could not decide what kind . Mr. Ewing could . <P> Last week , after seven months of study , he presented the President with a 186-page report . To nobody 's surprise , he recommended compulsory Government health insurance . <P> The nation 's health , Ewing began by saying , is not what it should be ( neither doctors nor Republicans were likely to argue that point ) . Every year , he estimated , 325,000 Americans die for lack of medical and health services : 120,000 from communicable diseases that might have been cured , 115,000 from cancer and heart disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infant deaths , 60,000 from other causes . <P> " If Not Impossible . " The next Ewing point moved on to debatable ground . The trouble is , said he , that only 20% of U.S. families can afford all the medical care they need , although the U.S. is well supplied with doctors and hospitals . About half of the families ( those with incomes of $3,000 or less ) find it " hard , if not impossible " to pay for even routine medical care . The U.S. needs a lot more medical and health services , according to Ewing , than it is getting . By 1960 , the Federal Government should be spending $2,313,000,000 a year ( exclusive of Government health insurance ) , and state and local governments $1,795,000,000 . <P> Ewing also outlined his case for compulsory insurance . He is convinced that voluntary plans are not and never will be enough ( even though Blue Shield increased its membership 3,500% in eight years and , with Blue Cross , now has 37,500,000 members ) . Only about half the families in the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance on a voluntary basis . <P> Not Socialization . Ewing 's crib-to-coffin plan would not be very different from Britain 's socialized medicine scheme . During a three-year " tooling up " period , when only those now covered by social security would be eligible , the Government would collect up to 1% on the first $4,800 earned , taking half from employee and half from employer ; eventually the rate would go to 4% when full medical service ( doctors ' fees , hospitalization , medicines , dental care ) would be available to everybody . <P> Since Congress is not in session , the Ewing plan is not good for anything now but arguments . But it will inspire plenty of those .
