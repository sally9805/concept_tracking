jessamyn West , a Hoosier by birth and a Californian by adoption , has published short stories in a number of magazines . THE SINGING LESSON A Story JESSAMYN WEST LM ERV . ' SCHOOL is built on a piece of low , unusable , alkaline land . There are no other buildings in sight . In spring it rises like a lighthouse above great fields of ripening barley ; in fall its shadow is long morning and evening across far-reaching stretches of stubble . In winter it stands solitary in the center of a pool of shallow , wind-scalloped water . The wind always blows about the schoolhouse . It lingers there as if the school were the last building it would be able to touch before plunging over the world 's edge , as if it were reluctant to trade domestic for universal architecture . Scalloping the water , the wind spoke to the teacher in the schoolroom at the Liberty School . It said far . It said distant , strange , remote . It said someday . " Miss McManaman , " suggested Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesson . " " I know we ought , " said Miss McManaman , but she did n't move . Rain had been falling all day  --  slowly and dispiritedly , with none of the clatter and excitement of a storm . Elongated drops hit the gray pool of water which surrounded the schoolhouse with a melancholy plop-plop . " Mr. Harmon , " urged Peter , " will be here tomorrow . " " 1 know he will , " said Miss McManaman , continuing to stare at the rain . On Thursdays Mr. Harmon , the music supervisor , drove out from town to give the Liberty School its weekly singing lesson . He was a severe , talented young man with perpendicular red hair rising above a somewhat greenish face . He had a voice so high , pure , and thin that when he sang the sound of it crept between the joints like electricity  --  or a razor blade . But Mr. Harmon did not sing often . " I come to hear you sing , Miss McManaman , " he said . By which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not sing . She had a disappearing voice . After four or five good notes , it vanished , fell like a waterfall over a precipice and was heard no more . " Why is this ? " Mr. Harmon would ask savagely , for he was married to his music and felt his awareness of Miss McManaman 's black eyes and cream-colored arms to be a kind of infidelity . " Why is it that a healthy young woman like you should have a disappearing voice ? How do you account for it ? " Miss McManaman could n't account for it  --  but it was a fact which she recognized . Playing the piano with one finger she taught Peter Mr. Harmon 's assignments , and Peter , singing , taught the school . On Thursdays , shorn of his musical significance , Peter would sit once more at his desk , and Miss McManaman , rcso-lutely opening and shutting her mouth , would lead the singing . But it made her unhappy : it was underhanded , and it was n't , she felt sure , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . Cletus . " " Can I be excused ? " " May , " Miss McManarnan said , and nodded . With the schoolyard under water the boys ' and girls ' outhouses could be reached only by wading  --  and everyone had to he excused often . Miss McManaman had said no at first to all this taking off of shoes , wading out , replacing shoes  --  but there had been an accident and now once an hour , if necessary , was the rule . And as soon as his hour was up necessity smote each pupil again and off he waded . " Take your shoes and stockings off and leave them off , " Miss McManaman ordered suddenly . " You 'll be less likely to take cold with bare feet than with damp shoes and stockings . Put your shoes and stockings by the fire to dry . " The children circled the stove with their shoes and hung their stockings over the edge of the woodbox . The woodbox , in addition to wood , held three semi-drowned squirrels , a family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever laid eyes on before , and a ground owl which was assuredly dead . Coyla , however , pleaded to keep it . " A live ground owl , " she told them , " do n't look very much alive . A dead one , I think , would have to look deader than this to be dead forever . " So they kept the ground owl , giving it the benefit of the doubt and warming it as thoroughly as the known living . " Teacher , " called Peter , who had no shoes and stockings to dry but had made a trip to the woodbox to inspect the refugees , " come quick . " Looking out of the high windows onto the rain-pricked , gently lapping water , Miss McManaman felt dreamy , too easeful to move . " You come to me , Peter . " Peter ran . " What d' ya think ? " he asked . " The one we do n't know the name of is having babies . Two already , " he said with pride . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine , " said Miss McManaman dreamily . " Put something over that corner of the box . A coat or something . " " Why ? " asked Peter . " Animals do n't like the light when they 're having babies . " " Why ? " " Make it snappy , " said Miss McManaman . " Will we sing then ? " " Yes , " said Miss McManaman , sighing , and went to the piano . " We got ta sing that ? " Peter asked , reading the words of the song over Miss McManaman 's shoulder . " Yes , we do . " " ' Cherries are ripe , cherries are ripe , the boys and girls all say . ' " Peter read the words so that even to Miss McManaman 's ear they sounded fantastic , " Listen , Peter , " she said , " this is the tune . " And she picked it out with one finger as spryly. as she could . " Pretty , is n't it ? " 0+ ouR , " said a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Miss McManaman swung about on the piano stool . That was n't a word to be used in the schoolroom , though it was not , she knew , a word which would startle her pupils . " Not your playing , Miss , " said the little man in the doorway . " That was refreshing . Full of feeling . Ping , ping , " he said . " Turn , turn . Like a gander pecking on a lard pail . Not plushed over . Simple and melodic . I was speaking of the tone of the piano . Sour , " he reaffirmed . " Sour as . . " " Please , " began Miss McManaman . " Swill , " said the little man . " Pig swill . You understand that , Miss ? Or Mrs. ? " " Miss , " she said , " McManaman . " " Irish . She was Irish , " he told her . " Please , " began Miss McManaman again . " To whom . . . ? " " Wilbur Smiley . Smiley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You must n't . . . " " ' You must n't swear , Mr. Smiley , before the dear little children . ' " " Well ; you must n't , " she said . " Paugh , " said Mr. Smiley . " Where 'd you learn the bad words you know , Miss ? Right here , " he said , pointing . " In the boys . And the girls . . . What 's the worst word you know , chil-dren ? " A dozen hands went up . " Ta , ta , children , " he reproved them . " You see ? " he asked Miss McManaman . " It 's in ' em . Working like yeast in a barrel and frothing at the bunghole . Treat ' em like human beings , " he advised . " Or cure ' em if you 're a mind to . Make ' em spend a day writing bad words on the blackboard . That 'll take the brimstone out of them . " " Really , Mr. Smiley , " began Miss McManaman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Smiley handed her a card . " Wilbur Smiley , " she read , " Piano Tuning . Vocal Music . 276 Railroad Avenue . Evenings by Appointment . " " Fooled you , did n't I ? " asked Mr. Smiley . " Sent out by your superintendent , Professor Barr . Musical outfit you got around here . Except for the piano . " Mr. Smiley , leaning , it-seemed , from the ankles , reached over Miss McManaman 's shoulder and with a slight flick of his hand sent a spatter of sound out into the room . " Be a waste of money . You do all the playing here ? " he asked . Miss McManaman nodded . " Be a pure waste , " said Mr. Smiley . He walked across to the stove . " Do n't get your dander up , " he advised Miss McManaman . He was a small , red-brown man with a peaked head , dusty hair , and deep-set eyes which went about the schoolroom , lapping it up : jut and cornice , chalk dust and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mind if I stir up the fire ? " he asked . " I ai n't hot-blooded like the rest of you here , " he said eying a row of bare feet . " We ai n't hot-blooded , " began Cletus , believing a slight to have been put upon them , but Miss McManaman interrupted him . " They have to wade , " she explained . " Often , too , I bet , " said Mr. Smiley , taking it in . With one hand he was poking up the fire , while with the other he felt about in the woodbox for fuel . " What 's this ? " he cried . He let the poker stand in the open stove and bent over the woodbox . " Fur-bearing wood , " he announced . He lifted the coat from the corner it roofed over . " Three already , " he told them , " and more expected . " He took the ground owl in his small hand and soberly regarded it . " Ashes to ashes . Dust to dust . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Birth , death , and the intermediate whistle stops . Do n't know , though , as life 's going to hold much surprise for these kids . They 'll already 've seen it all in the woodbox . " Mr. Smiley filled the stove with eucalyptus chunks , unwound his green scarf , laid aside his long black overcoat , and walked to the front of the room . H ERE an experienced teacher , Miss McManaman felt , would have asserted herself , said , " Would you care to hear the fifth grade spell , Mr. Smiley ? " or " What can you tell us , Mr. Smiley , of the art of piano tuning ? " But Miss McManaman was not experienced . She leaned against the piano , said nothing , traversed the slight distance which separated her from pupilhood herself , listened to the wind and the rain , lifted her eyes to Mr. Smiley 's face as if waiting to be asked by him to recite . " What was 1 interrupting when I came in ? " " ' Cherries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing lesson . " " Ah , well , " said Mr. Smiley , " this ai n't cherry weather . " With no hemming or hawing , no clasping of hands or arching of his chest , Mr. Smiley began to sing . He stood before them , his face a little sad , his eyes still looking about the schoolroom as if all he saw interested him , and sang words they could not understand in a voice so beautiful Miss McManaman pressed her hands to her heart . She could not say whether what she felt was bliss or pain . Both , she thought . As if all the things of which she had dreamed and for which she had waited , without having a name for them , were now spread before her , named , shining , and palpable . And that was bliss . But at this very minute of knowing and naming , she saw also that they would vanish : melt , run away , be lost forever . And that was pain . " Singing , " she said to herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was meant by the word they used each Thursday  --  the meaning she had missed and struggled toward . Mr. Smiley , his song finished , stood for a minute regarding the Liberty School pupils . Then , turning about , he stepped to the blackboard and with three or four large swoops erased Miss McManaman 's silent reading lesson and drew  --  in the space he had cleared  --  two hearts . He then stood aside so all could see . " This , " he said , pointing to the first , " is your heart . . . Thomas . . . George .. . Jane . . . Henry . A fine muscle . . . empty , easy , beating free . " Then upon the second heart Mr. Smiley made with his piece of chalk the slanting dashes Miss 11 , feManaman 's pupils used to show that upon a landscape they had pictured , rain was falling . " This is my heart , " Mr. Smiley said . " These are my tears . Tears , " Mr. Smiley repeated quite impersonally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He began to sing again . His second song was simpler than his first ; it was gentle and flowing , like rain in the early morning , or a river under trees . It sounded to Miss McManaman like the beginning of things , like first days : the new key in the rusty lock , the fresh flag hoisted , the September bell tolled . It sounded like her first day at Liberty School . W TATTING for her the morning she had begun teaching was a hay wagon . It stood on the school grounds like a frigate come to rest . Three people looked down at her from its high seat : a stout old man with a flaring semicircle of white whiskers , a ruddy woman of middle age , and between them a small boy with bright eyes and a red mouth . Mother and son dismounted by means of a ladder , slowly and with dignity . " Miss McManaman , " said the ruddy woman , " this is George Washington Berryman , the fruit of our old age . We are raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help . " " I will help you , " Miss McManaman had said , with the feeling of taking a vow . " If he can learn , " said his mother , " well and good . If he ca n't , train him to be holy . Or it could be both . But that 's not likely , " she added . " One or the other 's as much as can be hoped for . Remember your name , " Mrs. Berryman told her son . " Do n't do anything he 'd be ashamed of . " Mrs. Berry-man did n't kiss her son in parting , but laid her hand for a minute on his shining , egg-shaped head . Then Mr. Berryman helped his wife to remount and drew up the ladder after her like a skipper preparing to cast off . On the plank bridge at the edge of the schoolyard he reined in his horses for a minute and Mrs. Berryman , pivoting about on the high seat , called back a farewell message to her son . " Stay pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear , sad voice . " Stay pure . " The five Rosses came unaccompanied across the fields : downy-eared , round-eyed , their brown cheeks frosted with crumbs . " The first day of school , " Miss McManaman chided them . " Us Rosses , " Jennie , the oldest , explained , " always eat whatever 's in our lunch pails for dessert on the way to school . Then it 's done with and we do n't have to worry about it any more . " " Why do you worry , " asked Miss McManaman , " about dessert ? " " It 's not the dessert , " said Jennie . " It 's when to eat it . Should you eat it first recess ? If you do , you kick yourself . If you do n't , you think about it till second recess . Should you eat it then ? Second recess is awfully near to noon . At noon you got all the rest of your lunch . Maybe you should save it to eat going home . If you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em beg so . Us Rosses always eat it the minute we 're out of sight of the house . That way it 's done with . Do n't have to worry any more about dessert all day long . " Jennie brushed the crumbs from her face . Mrs. Renzo brought Ada to school the first day . " Ada 's backward , " said Mrs. Renzo , " she 's a little slow . But she 's deep . Ada 's got ideas 'll surprise you . She 's got strange , deep ideas , " said Mrs. Renzo . Miss McManaman had gazed at Ada 's face . It had every appurtenance faces have , yet it seemed primitive : an early , trial face to which , century after century , endearing and humanizing details would be added . It was a small granite face , made by a hurried man with a sharp chisel . " What I figure , " said Ada to her teacher , " is this . God is a bird . A peacock probably and the stars is his tail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " See ? Deep and strange like I said . " Peter , in his green fedora , led the Mendezes across the early morning fields . Behind him , and stepping in time to the harmonica which he played , were Felicita , Pablo , Josephina , and little Fructoso . " Good morning , " said Miss McManaman to the Mendezes . " Here bright and early . Would you like to look at your new readers ? " " To hell with reading , " said Peter , tapping the spit from his harmonica . " Numbers is what counts . Numbers is the way you read real things . " O H , I must teach him to read , " thought Miss McManaman now , watching Peter 's listening face  --  seeing it shining as though the music to which he listened were summer sunlight . " I must teach him to read . There are things numbers can never say . " Mr. Smiley finished his second song and went again to the blackboard . There he drew a human foot , narrow-heeled , long-toed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a beautiful foot made to spring away , to fly , and never linger . Mr. Smiley , from the heart , his heart , the one which was filled with tears , drew a stream full and lapping over which ran beneath the culvert of the high-arched foot and was lost in the far reaches of the south blackboard . " From my heart , " he said , " the tears she has no use for . They flow under her foot , " he said , tracing the stream , " but never touch her . She walks dry shod . " " Is your name Agnes ? " he asked Miss McManaman . " Not Agnes , " she said . " Mary . " " Her name was Agnes , " said Mr. Smiley , and sang again . Was it the tears under the arch like a culvert he sang , was it the arch which unbending carried the weight ? Or was Agnes herself his song ? Whatever it was there was no sadness in it . Or , if sorrow was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until it had become bone and blood  --  for singing and seeing . Agnes . . where was Agnes ? Lost , gone , turned to another perhaps . .. but here was Agnes , unknown , a name only , a pallid name , alive in the rainy schoolroom , lifting it out of chalk dust , shivering the blackboards , setting all the Rosses , Mendezes , Tritonas , Hanrahans on the edges of their seats : showing Ada a non-peacock God , showing George Washington Berryman his mama 's pure dream . Sounding to Peter numbers he had never dreamed of . O NCE in October when the wind off the stubble fields had been hot and dusty and the children had fought and squirmed all day , Miss McManaman had gone to the girls ' outhouse and closing the door behind her had stood with her face pressed against the smooth pine boards , looking out at as much of the world as was to be seen through the crescent-shaped aperture in the door . And as she stood thus it had suddenly seemed to her that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had read : a prison so small one could never lie down ; so remote a human voice was never heard ; a prison where for twenty years her only sight of the world would he this finger 's breadth of sky and field ; her only assurance that all had not vanished from the earth , the hand which slid to her each night a bowl of food . Just at the moment when the sky had seemed on the point of closing in about her , she had flung open the door and rushed back to her pupils . " We are free , boys and girls , " she had cried . " We are free . " They were not startled by her words . " Of course , " they said . " What did you think ? " " Sometimes I forget it . Oh , boys and girls , let us go outside and run up and down in the wind and never forget it . " I SITENING to Mr. Smiley sing , Miss McManaman wanted to say to them once again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are free . " Listening to Mr. Smiley 's song . . . and not to his alone , she knew , but to that other one 's , the song noted down a hundred , or two hundred , years before by a hand seeking to record  --  what ? Not Agnes , who was Mr. Smiley 's song , nor the light , unfaithful , springing foot , nor the tears beneath the culvert , nor Wilbur Smiley 's rain-pocked heart  --  or was that it ? Was that all there ever was to sing , whatever hand set the notes down , whatever throat swelled with the beautiful , glancing sounds ? Was that all ? Agnes , the beauty , the tears , the rain ? . . . Miss McManaman , listening , could not be sure . But she wanted to say to her children , " Remember , boys and girls , remember . Remember today . Remember the schoolhouse half afloat and the wind and the animals who were born whose names we did not know and remember me who loved you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still alive and beating . " Mr. Smiley , while Miss McManaman was wondering and dreaming , had come to the end of his song and had rewound his scarf about his neck and picked up his coat . " Say ' peach pit , ' " he told the Liberty scholars , " when you get a strong longing for a dirty word . It 's got an ornery ring to it , somehow . Then sing . That 'll do the trick . You 'll feel like you 've just said your prayers . " Miss McManaman walked to the door with him . " The bill will come for piano tuning , " he told her candidly . She scarcely heard him . " Oh , Mr. Smiley , " she said , " I can never tell you . . . you do not know . . . " Then she started over again . " It was so beautiful . . and I have to teach singing . And I ca n't , " she said . " I have a disappearing voice . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , undisturbed . " Too many voices in the world already . " MAGAZINE " It makes me so ashamed . Mr. Harmon expects . . . " " Ed Harmon , " said Mr. Smiley . " That musical saw . " " He knows so much , though . He can look at a song and sing it . He looks at a note , then opens his mouth and says it , the way I would a word . " " Vacant veins , however , " said Mr. Smiley . " Sound 's his whole stock in trade . " " I ca n't sing , " Miss MeManaman persisted . " Mr. Harmon says . . " " Why , Mary , " said Mr. Smiley , " do n't you know you got more music in one of them little white arms of yours than Ed Harmon 's got in his whole body and shock of hair ? You got grace notes in your eyes , Mary , and whole ballads in your hands . You sing with them . " Mr. Smiley turned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie had driven astraddle the walk right up to the porch . " Clearing a little in the west , " he said . Miss McManaman looked and in the far west saw a thin streak of clear green . " Say her name sometimes , will you ? " asked Mr. Smiley . " Say ' Agnes , Agnes . " ' " Oh , I will , Mr. Smiley , " said Miss McManaman . " I promise I will say her name and I will remember singing . " " So long , Mary , " said Mr. Smiley . Miss McManaman did not leave the porch until Mr. Smiley 's car was far up the road . When she went inside again Peter was standing at the head of the room . " I 'm going to teach the kids one of Mr. Smiley 's songs , " he told her . " Can you , Peter ? " she asked . " Do you think you can do it ? " " Sure , " he said . " Different words , maybe , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counts , " said Miss Mc Manaman . She walked to the stove and held out her hands to its warmth . There in the wood box , his eyes yellow and unblinking , the ground owl gazed up at her . She opened her mouth to say , " Children , the owl 's come to life , " but Peter had started singing . tell them later , she thought , happily .
