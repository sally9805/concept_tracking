The old man seemed cheerful . Now &; then his eyes twinkled ; sometimes he joked . But all this was deceptive . Mohandas Gandhi 's shriveled body was racked by malaria . His pulse lagged . He had moments of delirium . He was 73 . Death , which had walked beside him through many a fast and many a jail , again stood close . Or so , at least , it seemed last week to the British rulers of India . <P> From Gandhi 's prison in the Aga Khan 's shabby villa at Poona , doctors ' bulletins went to Viceroy the Viscount Wavell in New Delhi . The Raj had never intended to let the old man die in custody , and thereby become a martyr in the eyes of India 's restive masses . The Viceroy , with a nod from London at the proper medical moment , ordered Gandhi 's release . <P> Next day the old man wrapped himself in his shawl , passed through his prison 's iron gates . Outside , a cluster of followers cheered him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sorrow-steeped months in the Aga Khan 's villa ; there his Boswellian secretary , Mahadev Dezai , and his loyal wife , Kasturbai , had died ( TIME , March 6 ) . Now he journeyed to nearby Parnakuti , the rambling , white stone residence of his longtime friend , the wealthy , widowed Lady Vittal das Thackersey . <P> The old man 's doctors warned friends to spare him " all strain for some time to come . " Gandhi 's son , amiable , pudgy Devadas Gandhi , editor of the Hindusthan Times , did not feel optimistic . His father , he said , scorned medicines , relied for recuperation on massage , water and vegetables , and spiritual resources " beyond the conception of the Western world . " But the old man was indomitable : at Parnakuti he climbed 70 steps , led a household prayer meeting on an open terrace , asked for war news : " Let me know what is going on around me . If I am to die , let me not die an ignorant man . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eye : they were glad that Gandhi had been released , glad that the Viceroy had been wise . <P> Change of Spirit ? The Raj made one request of Gandhi : to keep political silence . The old man 's intimates prayed that he would regain strength for one more grand effort . They spoke hopefully of a meeting between him and the Viceroy , a meeting that might wipe the slate clean , win at long last the cooperation of India 's nationalists in the Empire 's war . Said Devadas Gandhi 's Hindusthan Times : " ... Though the communique says the decision was taken on purely medical grounds , we permit ourselves the hope that this marks a change of spirit which may show the way to understanding and good will . " <P> But the men at New Delhi still had Gandhi 's once potent political machine , the Congress Party , jacked up . Still at odds with Gandhi and his party was the increasingly powerful Moslem League . Still in jail were Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru , Maulana Kalam Azad and some 8,000 other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when , or if , the Congress Party recovered from British pressures and its own mistakes , and began to function again , it would not be the same without the binding personality of Gandhi . <P> Released , Mohandas Gandhi no longer spoke for all of India , nor even for all of the Congress Party . But he was still the symbol of India .
