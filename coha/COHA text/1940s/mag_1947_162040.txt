THE MOONLIGHT ( 309 pp. ) - Joyce Cary-Harper ( $3 ) . The Moonlight has the psychological suspense of a well-written thriller . But it is something more . It is the account of an English family trying to live by a Victorian code in the present-day world , told with personal aloofness from the tragic consequences that suggests the attitude of Thomas Hardy . <P> It concerns the twisted relationship of two sisters , Rose and Ella Venn . The hatred between them , writes Author Cary , " had a very long history , almost as long as their devotion . " Rose , " an obstinate old spinster , thin and black as a kitchen poker , " has all the self-righteous cruelty of a woman whose happiness has been given up for others . <P> She stops Ella from marrying a poet and forces her into an alliance with a worthless schoolteacher who is already married . Out of this comes an illegitimate child , who grows up and stages her own unhappy revolt against Spinster Rose . Her fate is her mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dolt . This is proof , says one character , that " it is often more dangerous to break a convention than a law . " <P> Convention , in Author Cary 's definition , is sometimes no more than psychological repression disguised as morality . But one of the women who defies it ends up declaring : " Duty , duty , duty is the salvation . It 's a hard bed but it is a bed ; one can be at peace there , one can escape from that misery of not knowing what is right and what is wrong . " <P> Author Cary is an Irish-born , Oxford-educated writer who has been widely acclaimed in England . The Moonlight is the second of his eleven novels to be published here . Readers may conclude that some English critics , who compare him to Tolstoy and Fielding , are overenthusiastic . But The Moonlight is superior to most of the fiction on the stands these days .
