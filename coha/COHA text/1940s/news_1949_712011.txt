txt New York , New Haven &; Hartford Railroad officials today warned that all Old Colony passenger service might be discontinued this fall , unless the state nurchases South Station . The railroad 's position was given at a State House hearing held by the Joint Legislative Committee on Transportation . After endorsing a legislative proposal for the State to purchase South Station and lease it to the railroads . Laurence F. Whittemore , president of the railroad , declared : " My opinion is that if we can not relieve the cost of operation of this service by some such method , we can not and will not be able to continue this service beyond the summer season . " Mr. Whitttemore emphasized : " I do not say we will do it . We do not want to do it . " Losses Claimed On the basis of as yet incomplete figures , he told the committee , " the loss indicated for the future would cause us to throw up the sponge for this service . " Mr Whittemore 's remarks , and also those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the railroad , apparently caught the committee chairman by surprise . Senator Edward C. Peirce ( D ) of New Bedford immediately commented that " if this is the case , we have to plan now to put in some competing service . " Earlier . Senator Peirce had attempted to obtain some guarantee from the railroad that Old Colony service would be increased if the state buys the South Station . Mr. Ely explained that the New Haven management could not enter an agreement for guaranteed operation of Old Colony service without the permission of the Interstate Commerce Commission . Plan Recalled Referring to the reorganization plan under which the railroad operates , Mr. Ely said the ICC will not waive indefinitely the right ( of the New Haven Railroad ) to abandon passenger service . " In asking the Legislature to authorize purchase of South Station from the Boston Terminal Company for about $9,000,000 , Mr. Ely cautioned : " The thing has got to be done by this Legislature or you might just as well throw it out.He argued that the state " would not lose anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project with the railroad paying for leases of parts of the station . Mr. Whittemore testified that the attitude of the new management of the railroad was more favorable to continuance of Old Colony passenger service than that of the previous management . According to Mr. Whittemore , the railroad , with the cooperation of the public , is making every effort to reduce losses and to continue Old Colony service . " We intend operating service until we see what the Legislature will do to cooperate with us at no risk to the taxpayer . " he said . Results Unknown After hinting that passenger service might be abandoned . Mr. Whittemore said : " It would mean not only defeat for the Cape Cod area . but would be a disappointment to me and Mr. Dumaine ( Frederic C. Dumaine. chairman of the board of directors of the railroad ) . " Mr. Dumaine , the New England financier who unexpectedly gained control of the railroad last fall , was present in the State House hearing . but did not testify . Mr. Whittemore said the results of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet known . By the end of the summer , he explained . the railroad will be able to determine whether passenger train service to Cape Cod should be discontinued . Order Challenged Questioned by Senator Peirce , Mr. Whittemore said he believed several months ' notice could be given , if service were to be abandoned . The railroad president stressed that he would willingly discuss with representatives of Old Col ony area communities whether improved service would bring greater patronage . The March 1 curtailment order of the New Haven has been challenged by the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities . A federal district court in New Haven , Conn .. has upheld the railroad , but the DPU is appealing . Under an ICC-approved reor ganization plan , the railroad may terminate Old Colony passenger service when the railroad loses more than $850,000 in a year , The railroad has lost several million more dollars than the $850,000 limit , it says . Discussing the attempts of the New Haven railroad to obtain rate increases in other states , Mr. Whittemore said that in New York and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they wo n't consider them until we stop losing money on the Old Colony in Massachusetts , "
