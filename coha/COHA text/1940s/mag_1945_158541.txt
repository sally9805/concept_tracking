Everything in radio , Fred Allen once said , is as fleeting as a butterfly 's cough . One exception he might have made is the work of Norman Corwin , Columbia 's boy wonder , whose radio scripts draw down ecstatic fan mail , are frequently rebroadcast , even attain the comparative immortality of book publication ( 13 by Corwin ; More by Corwin ) . Last week Corwin did it again . His full-hour V-E day program , On a Note of Triumph , had a Sunday repeat performance , and in book form , without too much ballyhoo , was selling so fast that Publishers Simon &; Schuster rushed out a second printing of 25,000 copies . <P> Triumph has all of the virtues and some of the faults of Corwin 's craftsmanship . It uses contrast effectively ( a taut-voiced announcer says , The voice you hear will be that of the Conqueror : the man of the hour , the man of the year , of the past ten years and the next twenty-and a hesitant , uncertain G.I. voice speaks up ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <P> How much did it cost ? <P> Well , the gun , the half-track and the fuselage come to a figure resembling mileages between two stars . . . . <P> High octane is high , and K-rations in the aggregate mount up ; also mosquito netting and battleships . <P> But these costs are calculable , and have no nerve-endings . . . . <P> In the matter of the kid . . . who died on a jeep in the Ruhr , <P> There is no fixed price , and no amount of taxes can restore him to his mother . <P> In the book , set as if it were verse ( and with all staging directions eliminated ) , Corwin adds many lines that the program had no time for , changes a few broadcasting bowdlerisms ( bejeepers becomes beJesus ) . But what makes the scalp tighten when backed by sound effects and Bernard Herrmann 's excellent score and eloquent silences frequently looks tinselly in type . The eye sometimes misses the dramatic moment that Corwin skillfully devises for the ear : the sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sub , to ask the men inside if they 've heard the V-E news-and no answer comes . <P> Without the interruption of an impish , hillbilly doggerel song ( Round and Round Hitler 's Grave ) Triumph 's unrelieved pounding at its worthy message ( internationalism ) sometimes takes on the sound of an hour-long lecture ; and occasionally , with the best intentions in the world , it is mawkishly patronizing about the little people to whom it is addressed . Yet the best of Corwin is a kind of poetry , and is U.S. radio at its best : <P> Lord God of test-tube and blueprint <P> Who joined molecules of dust and shook them till their name was Adam , <P> Who taught worms and stars how they could live together , <P> Appear now among the parliaments of conquerors and give instruction to their schemes : <P> Measure out new liberties so none shall suffer for his father 's color or the credo of his choice : <P> Post proofs that brotherhood is not so wild a dream as those who profit by postponing it pretend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes of little people through expected straits .. . . <P> That man unto his fellow man shall be a friend forever .
