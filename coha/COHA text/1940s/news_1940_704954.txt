On leaving the Acting Secretary of State , Mr. Cudahy said they had had " a very satisfactory meeting " and that he was having lunch with Mr. Welles tomorrow .

On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ambassador was asked about the statement attributed to him in London that the German soldiers had behaved better in Belgium than American troops would have done . // CUDAHY IS CLEARED BY THE PRESIDENT // Mr. Cudahy said his words had been " misinterpreted . " His intention , he said , had been only to emphasize that the discipline and conduct of the invading German soldiers had been noteworthy . Ambassador Cudahy expects to conclude reporting on his mission and its problems by the end of the week . During a London visit before his departure from Europe , Ambassador Cudahy told reporters that Belgium and the Low Countries faced a famine this Fall . The report of the interview in London indicated that he also said he would recommend that the United States Government undertake to send supplies to Belgium . He said today that he did not assert he would make such a recommendation .

" I a mmystified about the furor over the statement credited to me in London , " Mr. Cudahy said . " There was nothing said touching policy whatsoever , but I suffered from concealment . I am aware of the fact that concealment is the best method of creating a false impression . That is to say , when you talk about one statement and do not add another which negatives the first , you create a false impression . " Now one of the statements which seemed to arouse the most commotion was that I by inference declared that foodstuffs should be sent to Belgium . It will be established beyond question that Belgium will be facing a very hard ration not later than the first of October . " That country is a 75 per cent importinrnation of its main ration of diet , wheat , and supplies on hand will be gone before the next harvest day is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about food supply , and I went into detail , being , of course , familiar with the situation . Then I was asked whether I proposed to recommend to my government that measures be taken to supply Belgium and I said that that was none of my affair , that that was a question of policy . I made that statement as emphatically as I could . " When I saw this interview I wrote down the facts of the interview , and I have been trained in remembering interviews . " In response to an inquiry whether he found fault with the State Department in making public a reprimand for his interview , he replied : " Most emphatically I did ; there is no question about it . But the action itself was not intended as a rebuke , it was explained . " Mr. Cudahy said that his return to this country was based on an order sent to him on-June 19 , but one he could not follow ' at that time because of the press of work to be done in Brussels . He remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . " We were all liquidated , " he said .

Kennedy and to book passage by airplane from England , an arrangement later made impossible . Mr. Cudahy denied " without qualification " reports he might run for the Senate in Wisconsin . He said that he would go to New York for a few days to " follow my mission " by conferring with interested business houses on conditions in Belgium and then go to his Wisconsin home on vacation for which he has " accrued leave . " While obviously bitter at the construction put on his remarks by newspapers abroad , the Ambassador said that since his return " the press treated me fairly . " " But I can not help feeling a smart , " he added , " under the editorials brought to my attention which I think were unwarranted and based on a unilateral report .
