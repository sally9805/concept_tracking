In the big continent down under , the scattered cities and distant towns celebrate yearly with prayers , parades and boutonnieres of wattle* Australia 's most important holiday , Anzac Day . Australians like to recall that it was on April 25 , 1915 , when Australian and New Zealand troops landed at Gallipoli , that the youthful nation " first got into trouble . " Last week on Anzac Day , Anzac troops were again in trouble , fighting the last cruel hours of their desperate delaying action at Thermopylae , and Australians ' anxiety for the safety of their soldiers and security of their nation ran high . <P> Politically the British defeat in Greece just about blew the delicately balanced lid off the Australian tea-billy . Much of the Australian press , a majority of Australians and almost all of the continent 's vociferous Laborites wanted to know why the Anzacs had been sent into the hopeless Greek campaign in the first place , above all why Australia 's Advisory War Council had not been consulted before they were sent . <P> Said one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge , " Herbert Vere Evatt : " It is unfortunate that early communiques suggested that the Anzacs in Greece were part of a large and fully equipped British Army . It is now known that this was entirely misleading . " <P> Another Council member , lean , slum-born John Albert Beasley , co-leader of the Australian Labor Party , added to his criticism another note . " The battle for Britain is the kernel of the war , but there is also the battle for Australia . We must concentrate our minds on the Far Eastern position . . . . Frankly I am anxious to know whether sufficient naval assistance could reach us . Our strategy is necessarily a Pacific strategy . I want to insure in time that Australia is not left alone or communications with her forces abroad cut . Everything possible associated with the defense of our own shores must be uppermost in our minds while this crisis lasts . " None too popular with Australia 's potent trade unions , Prime Minister Robert Gordon Menzies ' War Government is particularly vulnerable to Labor Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative parties , the United Australia and United Country Parties , and has had a majority of only one in the 75-seat Canberra Parliament . The Labor opposition refused to enter the Government after last September 's general elections . And to add to Mr. Menzies ' political troubles last week , the Government 's Parliamentary Whip suddenly died , leaving the Government no majority at all . <P> To make things tougher for him , the crisis caught big , cagey " Bob " Menzies in London , where he had been conferring with Winston Churchill ( and reportedly criticizing sharply British strategy in the Balkans and Africa ) . Deputizing for him in Australia was Treasurer Arthur William Fadden , a 45-year-old Queensland accountant whose political stock has been rapidly rising while Menzies has been in Britain .
