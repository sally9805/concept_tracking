For three months , as the Government has struggled in the deepening morass of Britain 's troubles , Winston Churchill has thrived on the confusion of his Laborite adversaries . His temper has shortened , his glower deepened and his oratory come to full flower again . He no longer talks about turning over his captaincy to a younger man . Some optimistic Conservatives have brightened ; perhaps , after all , there is an immediate future for the Tory Party . <P> This week Churchill and his chieftains had a chance to overthrow the Government and force a general election . Labor was split over the conscription bill ; a fortnight ago 75 anti-conscription Laborite rebels voted against the Government . Its skin was saved by the Conservatives , who voted for the bill-although they might have found reasons of their own for opposing it , and thus forced a general election . The tactical opportunity will still be open to the Tories when the bill comes up for second reading . <P> To Gain a Plague . Among the men around Churchill in this moment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leadership : tired , greying , 49-year-old Anthony Eden ( most Britons still think of him as younger and more dynamic than he actually is ) ; cool , aloof Richard Austen ( " Rab " ) Butler ; able Sir Oliver Lyttelton ; clever Harold Macmillan ; lazy Oliver Stanley . But there was little doubt that the telling weight in the decision would be Churchill 's . And there was almost no doubt that Churchill would decide against trying for a knockout blow . <P> In Britain 's hour of need for leadership , the Loyal Opposition does not want to take power . For one thing , most Tory leaders do not believe that the country would support them . If they did come to power , they would have to champion more of the same harsh , unpopular measures ( including conscription ) which have plagued Labor . A Tory Government would not be able to get as much cooperation from British workers as the Labor regime . Said one Conservative M.P. : " If we had won the 1945 election , we would now probably be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> However , the Tory futility is rooted in something far more significant to Britain 's future than the political maneuvers of the moment . The hard truth is that Big-C Conservatives have lost their faith in small-c conservatism . They are now economic and political agnostics , with no new belief to replace their lost faith in free enterprise . <P> To Lose a Precept . British Tories agree almost unanimously on the necessity of thorough public controls . They quarrel mostly with the degree and not the principle of public ownership . They believe that free enterprise has gone out of their lives ; and a sizable minority believes that that is a good thing . The current best hope of most businessmen who think of themselves as conservatives is that they will be left reasonably unrestricted as the agents of public enterprise . <P> The Conservative Party may continue for a while to be an alternative to a Labor Party . But it is now clear that it will be conservative in name only . Said one grim Tory M.P . last week : " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to run Socialism properly . "
