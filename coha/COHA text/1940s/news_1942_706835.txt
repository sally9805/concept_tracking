txt Despite gasoline tax revenue slumping 35 to 40 per pent since rationing became completely effective , Massachusetts finance officers expect to end the State 's fiscal year on Nov. 30 with a substantial cash surplus to help solve forthcoming budget problems . Exact size of this surplus has not been revealed by the financial experts . However , Charles W. Greenough , State Budget Commissioner , today predicted it will be well over $1.000,000 . Several factors are responsible for this encouraging note in the State 's budget situation . They include : 1 . By drastic economies , such as elimination of new road building , abandoning of various capital improvements on State property , and cutting out all but essential work , the Governor built up a war emergency fund of $7,000,000 and a $4,500,000 fund to offset declining revenues . Thus far less than $3,500,000 has been spent from the $7,000 , - 000 war fund . With less than a month left of the fiscal year , the war fund spending undoubtedly will not exceed $3,500,000 . Other Revenue Holds Up 2 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Motor Vehicles license and registration fees have dropped sharply in recent months , revenue from other tax sources has held up well . In some categories , Mr. Greenough reported , the yield has exceeded estimates , namely , the tax on horse and dog racing . ' and the levy on liquor . Regardless of 1942 surplus pros= pects , Mr. Greenough is facing the most difficult task of his term as Budget Commissioner in formulating the forthcoming budget . In 1943 , the State changes over from a fiscal year opening on Dec. 1 to one starting on July 1 . Gov . Leverett Saltonstall pushed through the 1941 Legislature the measure making the fiscal year change . The plan is designed to provide a more effective check on expenditures . Under the Dec. 1 fiscal year at least a half year goes by before the current budget is adopted by the Legislature and becomes effective . During the intervening period , in theory at least , departments are authorized to spenti at the monthly rate of 1-12th of the previous year 's appropriations , making budgetary control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year system , the budget will be passed before the opening of the fiscal year . Thus real control can be maintained immediately upon departmental spending . But the change , at this time , is giving Mr. Greenough and Paul W. Foster , Chairman of the State Commission on Administration and Finance , a hectic time . The Governor and his financial experts must prepare a two-year budget for the biennial period running from July 1 , 1943 to June 30 , 1945 . In addition , they must submit to the Legislature another budget to cover the interim period , Dec. 1 , 1942 , to June 30 , 1943 , to cover State spending during the changeover months .
