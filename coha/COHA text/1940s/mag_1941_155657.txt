" The taking of Moscow would doubtless have a great political import , but it could never be a decisive act for the whole war . The control of the Donets Basin , however , is decisive . " This statement by a Berlin spokesman may have been partly apology for the way the German drive on Moscow stalled last week . But it was also partly true . <P> The Donets Basin is more important strategically than Moscow , and last week the Germans were trying hard to take the Donets Basin . They captured Taganrog , on the approaches to Rostov-on-Don . <P> They took Stalino , an important steel center 75 miles to the north . They reached Kharkov , hub of the eastern Ukraine as Pittsburgh is of western Pennsylvania . <P> They renewed attacks on the Crimea . <P> The Russians complained that Italian , Hungarian and Rumanian forces had swelled German ranks to such an extent that the enemy enjoyed great superiority in numbers . The sending of Marshal Semi-on Timoshenko to this front suggested how badly things were going . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be decisive . But it would make a great difference . It would mean that the old industrial Russia would have been pretty completely crushed-nearly as completely as the old industrial China was crushed when Tientsin , the Shanghai-Nanking-Hankow triangle and Canton were taken . <P> Now the new Russia-the upper Volga , the Urals , the basin of the great River Ob in Siberia-would have to take over its own defense . This was an unfinished , incomplete Russia . It would need outside help . But it might be able to deliver some surprises . Certainly the Germans would not win their decision if this Russia stood .
