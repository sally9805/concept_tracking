txt Topics of The Times Our city scout , prone And Men to nostalgic retrospect , Change and particularly attenWith Them tive to changes in the setting of the stage on which the drama of New York is played , tells us that he was sharply reminded this past week that it is not only the setting that changes but the cast of players . A. E. Thomas , whose death was then recorded , was , he says , the last of a very notable company that gave color and character to the life of the town when this century was young and the impatient ways of a world metropolis in the awkward age had not yet thrust aside the traditions and manners of Old New York  --  when dignity and a certain formal elegance had not departed even from what was called the Rialto , only a couple or so of decades earlier promoted from Irving Place to Broadway . Those were the days ( he First went on ) when John Drew Nights and Maude Adams were of Old stars at the Empire , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " The Sultan of Sulu , " when Brian Hooker put " Cyrano de Bergerac " into English that crackled and sparkled ; when what were called " problem plays " were frowned on by critics who had not yet got fed up with drawing-room comedy , wistful romance fetched in from Maritime Bohemia and gay musicals about girls from pleasant places overseas . According to the scout , the men who kept theatrical company and wrote and made pictures for the lighter-minded public in that happy time wore an air of elegant distinction as an accustomed garment , and used wit as the edge tool it is , and not like matches scratched on the outside of the box for the sake of the flash and the noise , as got to be the futile fashion a bit later . Not all of the cast were as good , as some of them , even this backward-looking fellow admits , but to show how good were the best of them it was only necessary to set down a few names . And he pro-ceeded : " Take Oliver Herford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of use the lightest words as the Best rapiers ; take Don Marquis , who distilled profound philosophy out of unconsidered trifles ; take that solemn-faced Yale man Hooker , who put a Greek chorus  --  in the original classic tongue  --  into the ? Broadway musical that said to Hell with Burgundy . And take that pintsized pattern of Victorian gallantry , Reginald Birch , with the flower in his buttonhole and an air that matched the elegance of his drawings , but who never got over dressing up Lord Fauntleroy in pen-and-ink ; take Otis Skinner , robust actor and great gentleman ; take Thomas himself , not the least urbane and accomplished of the crew , who looked as if he had stepped out of a painting by Velasquez . " The scout paused for The Old breath , and then took up Order the tale . " Take them all ? Changes and all in all we shall not see their like again . The whole picture changed with the cast of characters that followed them upon the scene . Whether the newcomers were lesser men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public what it wanted and their reward was applause in plenty and sometimes fame and fortune . But they had lost the grand manner and the grace which had clung to their predecessors , even when the old rascals were doing things and saying things they should n't . And that was a thing that happened not infrequently . For they carried on with gusto . " For our part , when we A Wreath remember what a first of night at the Empire used Rosemary to be like in the days the scout was talking about and when we compare it with a first night on Broadway today we suspect that there is something in what he says . We have had a couple of World Wars since , many changes in our big city and many seasons in the theatre , some of which have delighted the most severe critics  --  who nowadays are apt to complain when plays are n't " problem plays " ? only what they call it is " social significance . " We have had a revolution in our art of fiction chaperoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in public print words that could not be spoken by gentlemen except when they were off duty , so to speak , or ready to face a fight . But those bygone days and those bygone ways had something worth remembering . And the men who made them what they were are also worth remembering .
