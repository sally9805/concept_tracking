In the bustling seventh-floor newsroom of the New York Daily News , a shirt-sleeved copyreader , pale-faced under the fluorescent lights , strove for a headline that would tell a crime story . When he had one that suited him , he flipped it over to the man in the " slot " of the horseshoe-shaped copy desk . It read : <P> WILD HUNT NIPS <P> 2-GUN , 2-PANTS <P> CROOK IN SKIRTS <P> To the 2,225,000 readers of the tabloid Daily News next morning-or the smart minority that could read headlines-the head meant that the cops had caught an armed burglar wearing two pairs of pants and a skirt as well . Last week it was pinned on a bulletin board , and Copyreader Harry Mott got an extra $20 in his pay envelope for writing the headline of the week . <P> Few newspaper readers suspect how much headwork goes into headlines . A head must do more than nutshell the news and lure the reader into the story . First &; foremost , it must " count , " which means that the type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the copydesker spends his life finding short words like " nips " for long ones like " arrests . " <P> Until the tabloids came along , headlines tended to be wordy and dull , with each " bank " of type telling part of the story . Now , most headlines are briefer and more to the point . Nowhere in the U.S. are they as pointed , cynical , impudent or brassily clever as in the Daily News . Sample ( on meat prices and inflation ) : <P> <P> PRICES SOAR , BUYERS SORE <P> COW JUMPS OVER THE MOON <P> The man who made the Daily News , the late Captain Joe Patterson , demanded that his headline hunters make their heads " understandable , applicable and bright . " The man who keeps them that way is tall ( 6 ft. 3 in. ) , red-mustached William Bernard Murphy , 53 , copydesk chief . A paper like the Daily News is only as good as its copy desk , and the desk is as good as its chief , who must combine speed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye on guard for double meanings . <P> Bill Murphy is no part of the newspaper tradition that copyreaders are just broken-down reporters . A Yaleman ( ' 17 ) and onetime Wall Street bond salesman , he left Manhattan to work on the News-owned Detroit Mirror . When Patterson torpedoed it without notice in 1932 , Murphy went back to the News to stay . <P> One night in 1937 the late Harvey Deuell , managing editor of the Daily News , told Murphy to " take over the copy desk on a temporary basis . " The " temporary " basis became permanent ; Murphy likes it-and the pay of more than $10,000 a year-well enough to turn down better jobs . Recently , when he lost an eye , he thought he might have to change ; but his one good eye is still enough to oversee the output of his 14 " rim men . " They are all experts at trimming and polishing copy , as well as heading it up . They are not hampered by the shibboleths of most copy desks ( Newsmen may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-paid men by copydesk standards : they start at $110 a week and go up to $140 , plus bonuses for prize heads . <P> Some of their heads are newspaper classics . When a man walking home ran into an acquaintance and got into a fatal argument , the Daily News headlined it : <P> <P> A BUMP , A WORD , <P> A MAN IS DEAD
