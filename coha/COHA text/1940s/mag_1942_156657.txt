Two shapely brown shoulders and a round , roguish face , framed in a triangle of white light , showed above the grand piano 's shining ebony . From the keyboard Chopin 's Minute Waltz flowed fleetly , ripplingly . For a while it surged along according to Chopin . Then watchers saw an impish flicker of a smile , an insinuating movement of a shoulder . Came the first suggestion of a hot lick ; another , and another . Then Hazel Scott began to " break it down , " and was off in a wild mlange of pianistics , sweet , hot , Beethoven and Count Basic . <P> Her fans had known all along what was coming . Hazel Scott , star Negro entertainer of Manhattan 's Cafe Society Uptown , was doing what she does best , the thing that has lifted her into showdom 's top rank and made her this season 's Manhattan sensation : swinging the classics . <P> But where others murder the classics , Hazel Scott merely commits arson . Classicists who wince at the idea of jiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . She seems coolly determined to play legitimately , and for a brief while , triumphs . But gradually it becomes apparent that evil forces are struggling within her for expression . Strange notes and rhythms creep in , the melody is tortured with hints of boogie-woogie , until finally , happily , Hazel Scott surrenders to her worse nature and beats the keyboard into a rack of bones . The reverse is also true : into Tea for Two may creep a few bars of Debussy 's Clair de Lune . Says wide-eyed Hazel : " I just ca n't help it . " <P> Uptown , Downtown . Hazel got this lucrative bad habit while quite young . Born in Trinidad , she had lived in New York 's Harlem most of her life . When she was a sober little girl of 13 , she was given free piano lessons by a teacher in the Juilliard School . Her teacher got sick-the lessons stopped . She kept on studying the classics herself , but to relieve boredom , now &; then sneaked in a few stray blue-notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a wonderful vice . <P> At 15 , after her father 's death , she became pianist in an all-female band . Three years later she stopped a Broadway show , Sing Out the News , with her sultry rendition of Franklin D. Roosevelt Jones . But her break came with a chance to fill in for ailing Blues Singer Ida Cox at Barney Josephson 's downtown Caf Society , a Manhattan Mecca for jazz connoisseurs . Result : Hazel Scott has been entertaining Caf Society audiences ever since . Two years ago Showman Josephson opened a Cafe Society Uptown to house her art with greater swank , now finds it packed nightly with Scott fans : socialites , Broadway sophisticates , savants-about-town . Celebrities regard her with reverence , movie stars ask her for autographs . When Lieut . Commander John Duncan Bulkeley ( They Were Expendable ) came to New York , he picked out Hazel Scott on the welcoming platform , greeted her with " I 've always wanted to meet you , Miss Scott .
