" I am a warm , rich , and passionate human being and very few things are too much for me . . . . People go to a play because they want to get in out of the rain . <P> Or because they have a date with some rabbit in it later on . Or just because they happen to know the press agent and do n't have to pay . It is not that way with me . <P> I go because I love Life . That is an important statement and I want to repeat it : William Saroyan Loves Life . " This Wolcott Gibbs parody of a cocky Saroyan dramatic preface appeared on Manhattan newsstands one morning last week . Same morning 's papers told about some new Saroyan shenanigans . A brand-new , self-consciously indigenous , highly touted and talented group who call themselves the Ballet Theatre staged the world premiere of a Saroyan innovation . Its title was a phrase for which anti-Saroyans have long groped to describe William Saroyan himself : The Great American Goof . The author of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your Life , Inhale &; Exhale ( short stories ) , called his experiment a " balletplay . " It used music ( composed by Henry Brant ) , dancing ( choregraphed by Eugene Loring ) , dialogue ( Saroyan 's ) , and exquisite , dreamy sets consisting of stereopticon shadows cast on gauzy overlapping screens ( Boris Aronson ) - was , as Saroyan boasted in his cocky program note , " a new American form . " As usual by Saroyan , critics were baffled ; some thought the experiment goofy , some thought it just goo , some thought it really good . None could deny it was full to the lips with life . <P> The Goof , a cowlicky , touching little dandelion seed of a man whom Saroyan characterized as " the naive white hope of the human race , " wanted to change the world . He was thwarted wherever he went by an Easter-Parade cutaway-dummy representing conformity , and a deadpan gal named Destiny . He tried to change the world with love ( represented by Minsky models in black lace panties ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor . He pleaded with all sorts-a dope-fiend radical , a religious drunkard , a doting old man with a beard and a penchant for poetry , followed by a girl representing his sickness , a priest who stood for Capitalism , a boy with a fever of 105 . They all made the Goof cry : " I want to resign . " But at the moment when he was most desperately disillusioned , Destiny gave him quite a cute smile . So the poor Goof started all over again .
