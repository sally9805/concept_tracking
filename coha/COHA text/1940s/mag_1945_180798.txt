Turkey 's Foreign Minister Hasan Saka , homeward-bound from San Francisco , dropped off in London for a call on Britain 's Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden . High diplomatic secrecy muffled the 45-minute talk between the statesmen . But it could not muffle its importance . <P> Presumably Minister Saka told Secretary Eden what the Russians last month had demanded of the Turks as a prerequisite for a new friendship treaty ( TIME , July 9 ) . Besides the right to privileged use of the Straits and the right to police them , the Kremlin was reported to want : <P> Rectification of Turkey 's Balkan frontier . Apparently this meant the cession to Bulgaria of the Turkish Aegean port of Alexandroupolis ( Dedeagach ) . <P> Rectification of Turkey 's Asia Minor frontier . This meant the cession of the Kars region ( with the town of Ardahan ) to Russia . The Kars area ( see map ) , was wrested from Turkey by the Tsars in the 19th Century , given back by the Bolsheviks in 1921 , when Allied forces were in control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's demand for Kars had far-reaching implications . Physically the region is a remote forested plateau , once part of Armenia , now predominantly populated by Kurdish shepherds and bandits . It has fairly valuable salt mines , and rigorous winters . But strategically , Kars is a bastion commanding the entrance from Turkey into Russia and from Russia into Turkey . <P> The Russians say that " Kars is a British dagger pointed at Russia 's heart-Baku . " Kars dominates the valleys leading to Batum , Russia 's rail and pipeline terminal on the Black Sea , and the Transcaucasian roads to Russia 's biggest oilfields . But Kars can also be a Russian dagger pointed through Turkey at the British Empire 's oil arteries . It flanks the Iranian province of Azerbaijan about which Russia is much concerned . <P> For Turkey , Kars is the military key to its eastern defenses . If Kars passed into the Soviet Union , the rest of Turkey might soon follow into the Russian orbit .                @ @ @ @ @
