txt Subway Suggestion Here is a suggestion as to designation of stations on the subway lines so that passengers , especially strangers , may know the most convenient station at which to alight for their particular purpose . For instance , a passenger desires to go uptown by means of the Seventh Avenue subway ; his destination is Broadway and 161st Street . He gets on , say , at Chambers Street . There is a station at 157th Street and the next one is at 168th Street . Being a stranger , he can tell where he is by looking out of the window when he gets to a station . He sees 157th Street . He does not know whether to get off there or , take his chances with the next stop . There are not many guards or conductors on the trains to advise him . At each station , in addition to the present designation , why not add the designations of the next two stations ? One could thus figure out for himself two stations ahead at which to get off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1941.
