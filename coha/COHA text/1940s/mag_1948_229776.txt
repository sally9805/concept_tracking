In the vaulted hall of Florence 's Palazzo Strozzi , one day last week , art scholars and critics from all over the world were waiting . Through a tiny oaken door stepped a frail , bearded little man , Bernhard Berenson , the world 's greatest authority on Italian Renaissance art . Bobbing and nodding his white beard to the ovation , he hurried , with staccato steps , to the center of a long table . There , Italy 's Minister of Education Guido Gonella presented him with two bronze medals , one four centuries old , the other struck especially in his honor . After the minister 's speech , cheers broke out anew ; and " Il Bibi , " clutching his gifts in small , gloved hands , bowed and beamed his thanks . <P> Il Bibi is as much a part of Florence as the Pitti Palace-and , to the art world , as widely known . For almost 50 years " B.B. " has been an authority respected above all others . Millionaire collectors have sought him out for merely an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nod . His theories on tactile values have become a part of the stock in trade of art experts and connoisseurs . His meticulous researches into Italian masters have influenced a whole generation 's tourist guides and scholars ' volumes . <P> Pater Rejected . Bernhard Berenson breathes the air of a world long past . Born in Lithuania , of " the Jewish aristocracy , the old gentry , " he grew up in Boston , was working his way through Boston University when haughty , wealthy Mrs. Jack Gardner discovered his talents . She helped him through Harvard in return for his advice on her art collection . Then Bernhard went abroad . <P> He traveled to Oxford , married Logan Pearsall Smith 's sister , devoured-and rejected-the theories of Walter Pater . In Florence , he earned a bare living escorting tourists through the galleries until , in 1894 , he published his Venetian Painters of the Renaissance , the first of four handy , brilliant guidebooks which netted him enough to buy a lavish 17th Century villa high above the Arno valley . <P> He has lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke out , friends urged him to leave . He refused : " Rather than give up these cypresses and olive trees and this light , I would lay down my life . " Ambassador William Phillips then got a promise from Count Ciano that " Berenson would never be disturbed . " Finally , however , the onrush of the Nazis forced him out . After the war , two young partisans , sent by the Committee of National Liberation , found him in hiding and escorted him back to his cypresses and olive trees , his several servants , and the remote , unruffled life he had known before . <P> Sassetta on the Wall . I Tatti is more a court than a residence . At 83 , Il Bibi still begins his day at 6 , reading or writing or receiving visitors even before he has left his canopied bed . A fine Sassetta Madonna hangs on the wall .
