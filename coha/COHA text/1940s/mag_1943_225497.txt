A curious vestige of the code of chivalry is the wartime treatment accorded captured officers by nations subscribing to the Geneva Convention . Last week , under this arrangement , General Jrgen von Arnim and Italian Field Marshal Giovanni Messe were settling down in England to sit the war out in comfortable detention . <P> The ranking Axis commanders in the Tunisia debacle were quartered in " camps " - actually country homes with spacious but well-guarded grounds . The tactful British planted them several miles apart ; Messe and Arnim had differed sharply on strategy and were not speaking during the final days . Both are entitled to the stand ards of equivalent British officers living in mess . Thus they will fare better than Brit ish civilians , also better than Rudolf Hess , who is not a prisoner but an interned enemy alien . <P> Under the Geneva rules , captive officers are entitled to draw their pay . But in practice , to avoid transfers of large sums , the captor government pays only a nominal personal allowance . The British will pay Arnim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about $150 a week will be credited to his account in Germany . Messe , who got a boost in rank and pay just be fore his capture , will draw about $30 a week . British officer prisoners in Germany and Italy also get cash allowances ; after the war the nations are to reimburse each other for the sums advanced . <P> Majors , Field Marshals . Axis generals who surrendered to American troops in Tunisia will get fixed allowances of $40 a month each during their detention . U.S. practice calls for payment of $20 a month to warrant officers and lieutenants , $30 a month to captains , $40 to any rank from major to field marshal . <P> Privates and noncoms captured by the U.S. get a basic allowance of 10 a day and can earn 80 a day by working at such jobs as fanning , road building , forestry and flood control . Unlike their officers , they can be required to work , although not at any task directly connected with military operations . Twenty-two prison camps scattered about the U.S. now hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 62 crestfallen Japanese . <P> In the early months of the war Jap forces captured 18 U.S. general officers ( Lieut . General Jonathan Wainwright , five major generals , twelve brigadiers ) but almost nothing is known of their treatment and pay . Neutral observers who have seen prison camps in Japan and occupied China have reported that food was skimpy and not too good , that some recreation and self-government were permitted , that general housing and sanitary facilities were tolerable but far below the standards maintained for prisoners in Germany and Italy . <P> Japan announced that it would abide by the Geneva Convention ( which it never signed ) but so far has refused to permit representatives of the Swiss Government or Red Cross to visit the camp on Formosa where General Wainwright and many other Americans are interned . Unless the Japs decide to loosen up , the Army presumably will not learn until after the war how many ( if any ) yen and sen " Skinny " Wainwright and his comrades are getting .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
