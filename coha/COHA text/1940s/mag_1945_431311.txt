FOR Maj. William Orris and hundreds of other American airmen , being captured by the Germans was like being stranded in an incredibly weird and inadequate world . They were always hungry . They had no tools , and scarcely any material except tin cans . Yet they re-equipped themselves with nearly as many things as a novelty store sells ? and they pulled through . Orris is a tall , bright.eyed pilot who parachuted into the enemy 's custody five weeks before D-day and escaped three weeks before VE-day . His B-24 was hit by flak in a bombing run over Toulon . Blinded'and nauseated by gasoline fumes , he went out  | through the bomb bay and lit in a tree beside German headquarters . Looking back , he saw his own plane explode and the rest of his squadron disappear beyond the horizon . " Boy , " he says , " I sure felt lonely . " But the Major was luckier than many kriegies ( war prisoners of the Nazis ) . He learned the next morning that his crew was safe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilians . But he was not tortured , and he believes the Luftwaffe 's prison camp at Sagan , southeast of Berlin , in which he was confined for the next eight months , was one of the best in Germany . Even so , the food at this camp was neither good nor sufficient . But at first each man got a Red Cross parcel once a week , and Orris received one of the two dozen packages that his family sent , and about a fifth of the mail addressed to him from America . With tin cans as shovels , the boys leveled two baseball diamonds for themselves and cleaned out a water tank to swim in . But they soon talked and dreamed more about food than about sports or home or girls . Planning future menus was a favorite occupation , and Orris is carrying out those plans now . While talking to POPULAR SCIENCE MONTHLY 'S editors , he lunched on a fruit cocktail , two helpings of roast duck with all the  | trimmings , and a strawberry shortcake smothered in ice cream . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his breakfast was a cup of poor coffee and two slices of toasted but sour black bread , as thin as Melba toast . Lunch was another slice of bread and a bowl of barley soup as tasty as dishwater . And the day 's big meal was half a bowl of potatoes and cabbage with just enough meat to whet a soldier 's appetite . The kriegies were required to punch two holes immediately in every can of food they received from the Red Cross . This was to keep them from saving some for attempts to escape . Another result was that much of the food spoiled , and many men had-dysentery . When a rabbit came through the barbed wire , 70 or 80 of the imprisoned airmen would chase it like dogs . Even three cats that were pets of the prisoners were sacrificed after days of discussion and planning . One man was detailed to stun each cat with a club , another to skin it , and so on . The first man did not hit his cat hard enough , and it got away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men who ate the cat meat said it was good . The Germans let them have gardens , which they spaded and raked with tin cans . But the soil was miserable , and American officers solemnly followed the horses whenever a wagon entered the camp , waiting for manure . They even built a trap t- jolt the cart that carried waste away from the latrine , and salvaged the stuff that spilled out as fertilizer . When a kriegie found a nail , he kept it in his watch pocket and took it to bed with him , because it was a precious tool . They had table knives , forks , and spoons , but no pliers , screwdrivers , or hammers . Yet , in addition to doing their own cooking , they had to improvise the utensils . Their cooking was economical . They saved prune pits , for example , extracted the seeds , and cooked them in margarine to make a dessert . " It tasted like almonds , " says Major Orris . Coal was so scarce that they dug up stumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made " kriegie turners " out of tin cans . These were tiny contraptions that enabled them to get the maximum heat from leaves and twigs . These PW 's could not buy anything , but they ran a store where they swapped whatever they happened to have . The storekeepers set point values on everything , and some men soon learned to play the market . When smokes were fairly plentiful , they stocked up with cigarettes , held them until the point value rose , then traded them for soap or whatever else was offered . Others turned to handicrafts . Some saved metal from the tops of cans , made molds from AAF insignia , and cast new badges for those who had lost the wings from their shirts . A popular variation was an insigne with one wing clipped off and a tiny eight ball hung on a chain in its place . Some men made knit- ting needles out of bucket handles , then knit scarfs , sweaters , and gloves , to have something to swap . One man made himself a tin suitcase , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoonful of margarine .. Desperate amusement seekers made kites out of toilet paper , until the Germans declared this sport verboten . Then , lying in his bed one day , Major Orris saw a fly come in his window with a glider in tow . It was a tiny piece of paper , folded the way schoolboys fold sheets into toy airplanes , and attached to the fly by a thread . From then on , the imprisoned airmen had glider contests with the flies as tow planes . During his year in Hitlerland , Orris saw only two movies . One was from Hollywood . " The Male Animal , " and the other a propaganda film about the beautiful scenery in Germany . You can imagine how we felt about that , " he grins . But the kriegies made a curtain by sewing blankets together and put on stage shows for themselves . A loudspeaker blared German broadcasts at them , and they published two camp newspapers , lettering . them by hand and posting them on the wall . At Christmas , the kriegies scraped wax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Major Orris thinned the paint from a box of children 's water colors and decorated his window . Soon , nearly all the windows in the camp were gaily painted . but the prisoners got no " bash " ( extra big meal ) on the holiday . By January , they could hear the guns on the Eastern Front . The camp was near the Oder , and the Russians were coming that way . On an hour 's notice , in the middle of the night , the kriegies were marched out into a snowstorm , with the temperature 10 below zero . All the rest of the night , led by a horse and wagon , they marched three abreast in a column more than a mile long . Trails of blood were left by the bleeding feet of the horses and the guards ' dogs . When a plane swooped low as though about to strafe the marchers , some men dived toward the woods , and the guards opened fire on them . Stragglers , whether guards or prisoners . were just left behind . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; other guards fell in the snow . Polish women enslaved by the Nazis looked out of a factory window that dawn and wept when they saw the bedraggled , motley line of prisoners tramping down a  | side road . The men were billeted that day in a barren , dusty room over a pottery works ; other days they slept in barns , and once on a woodpile . The snow turned to rain , and the crude sleds on which some of them dragged their packs had to be discarded . Many had fatigue visions of rosy sunsets , fireworks in the sky , and beautiful green pastures . Eventually they were herded into cattle cars . The 50 men in the car with Orris found they could all lie down at once if they carefully knit their bodies together , and they jolted on across Germany to Nuremberg . There the weary , underfed , sick , and dirty men were soon covered with vermin and bites , because the cells into which they were dumped had not been cleaned . They received fewer Red Cross parcels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The more weevils we got , " says the Major , " the better we liked it . That was our meat ration . " Some of the men became so weak they seldom left their bunks . " They blacked out , " Orris explains , " if they stood up quickly . " American planes bombed the big railroad yards just beyond the prison fence . At Sagan , some men had been shot for rushing out and showing enthusiasm during air raids . But here they were allowed to sit on the sandbags and watch the fireworks while the guards ducked into slit trenches . Major Orris and another kriegie escaped while being marched out of this camp , fled to the woods , built themselves a lean-to , and waited . They were afraid they 'd be caught if they moved on ? and Patch was coming toward them . For two weeks they waited , listening to the guns , and living on scraps of food left by German troops who camped near by . They found other escaped prisoners in the woods , and played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the days seemed endless , so they risked moving on toward the northwest ? and almost ran into a tank concealed in the brush . Neither of them had ever seen that kind of a tank , so they supposed it was German and backed away fast . But when they peeked out farther on at an autobahn , they saw a long column of such tanks rumbling toward them ? and the faces beneath the helmets of the men on the first tank were black . " We just about cried , " says the Major , " because when we saw that they were Negroes , we knew we were free . "  |
