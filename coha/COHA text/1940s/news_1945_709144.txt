txt The Jewelry industry . now finishing the biggest year in its history , is looking forward to a prosperous 1946 ? if the goods can be iiroduced . For future historians , the indicated 1945 retail sales of 51,250 million will be as valuable an index that people were rolling in wealth as were record low sales of 5170 million in 1932 an indication of the bottom of the depression The Jewelry business is a sensitive economic : weather vane . Enough of it falls into the luxury class so that people buy most of it when they have surplus money and do without it wnen they 're short of cash This year they 've gladly paid twice as much for a diamond ring as they would have before the war . Diamonds , like other personal Jewelry , ha  --  e not been under Office of Price Administration ceilings . Plenit of Demand Problems ahead for the Jewelry industry din not he in the direction of immediate demand . There 's plenty of that . The nation 's six million war brides are clamoring for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . For costume Jewelry makers , there is not only a. big civilian market but the Army is urging them to take on the Job of making 23 million more medals and other emblems , including discharge buttons . Diamonds . which were received from abroad during the war in small amounts , were never so anxiously sought . according to Jewelers . But the key to the situation is that this demand is immediate . The weather vane characteristic of the jewelry industry might begin to assert itself if the public starts to run out of surplus cash . A lot of those war brides might not buy new silverware , especially if its purchase meant giving tip A. new radio or a new toaster . Meantime . the Jewelry industry is having its troubles getting off to a good post-war start to take care of immediate demand for its products . Ca n't Find orkers Jewelry manufacturers complain that labor is hard to get This is ' especially true in costume Jewelry plants where the pay has traditionally been low and the work seasonal . Even silverware and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that they are n't getting back enough skilled craftsmen who left them when they had to curtail output during the war . Also , these manufacturers say they ca n't find enough young men willing to learn the business . Materials are also short , say Jewelry manuf a ctu rers . Such metals as copper and brass which go into gold-filled jewelry should pick : up in supply as reconversion in the metals industry progresses But the delay is especially annoying to an industry overwhelmed by demand for its products . The Jewelry makers have been held up by the silver situation , too . For a long time foreign countries I principally Mexico ) all but refused to ship silver here because the price paid was too low . then it was raised , which has encouraged the resumption or shipments . Meantime , the Jewelry industry has been worried about the biggest domestic source of supply  --  silver set aside by the Treasury from its vast store , for SRN ' to industry That was provided for under the Green Act , which expires December 31 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraged by the Treasury , is pushing through legislation to continue making Treasury silver available to industry . Story on Page 2 Flatware Items Dropped Meantime , silver flatware sets in production are being limited in number of designs and parts to stretch present short supplies of silver and labor . Sets do n't include such pre-war extras as pickle and lemon forks . They are limited generally to teaspoons , soup spoons. table spoons , knives and forks and salad forks . Production of silver hollow ware is being held down not so much due to the lack of silver as to the tin stringency Tin is an essential alloy for Brittama Metal , an alloy of tun. zinc and antimony , a base metal used for hollow ware  --  sugar bowls , tureens and other concave pieces . Good Outlook for Watch Maker , ' Of all segments of the jewelry industry . watch makers appear to have the best outlook , both as to the demand and their ability to meet it While the American market was well supplied with watches from Switzerland during the war , ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watches until the return to the market of well-known American names like Elgin , Waltham and Hamilton . This demand , unlike that for some jewelry , be permanent . Watches hill into the essential category with most Americans . Also encouraging to the domestic makers is the prospect that shipments of Swiss watches to this country are expected to fall off sharply . Swiss manufacturers have to divert part of their production from the U. S. to recapture markets which were cut oft to them during the war . These markets are England . France , Belgium , Holland . Africa . and the Far East . In addition , the United States Department of State is reported to have naked Switzerland to make a sharp cut in her exports to this country . To ' satisfy the demand for their products , O. S. watchmakers are in a good position . During the war they were engaged in makin , ordnance precision products or timepieces for the armed services  --  products which are identical with their regular lines of watches or near enough to them so that their labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply lines will tit into their peacetime production pattern . Thus . U. S. watchmakers are fast getting into peacetime gear . They expect to be delivering watches in volume in three to six months . Currently . distribution is being held up becuse manufacturers have not a sufficient ' backlog to assure their thousands of retail outlets a supply . Demand for diamonds is expected to continue high . An important factor here is that Belgium and Holland will be active bidders for rough diamonds as they try to reestablish themselves as diamond-cutting centers . Fine one-osrat cut diamonds increased imt pries from 55 , - , to S5 " . m U. S. jewelry stores during the war . Melee ( small stone ) diamonds more than tripled in price . Similarly , prices of sapphires. rubies and ither precious and semi-precious stones went up substantuilli ? in the war period . Stones and other personal jewelry were not under ceilings . It is this absence of price regulation oat personal Jewelry that will be responsible to large extent for lifting jewelry sales this year close to $1 i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of record outlays of around $1 billion in both 1943 and 1944 . Still , sales of watches , clocks and silverware , which are under ceilings , have been considerable , say jewelers who point to shelves that are fast-emptying in the Christmas buying rush . The doubling of the excise tax in 1944 -- -from 107 , to 20% -- did not act as any brake on sales .
