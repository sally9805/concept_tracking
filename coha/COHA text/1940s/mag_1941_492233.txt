WHEN the winter of 1929-30 closed down over New Hampshire 's White Mountains , it found the villagers holed up , with all but one of the region 's great and small resort hotels closed tight , waiting the return of warm weather and summer vacationists . Peckett 's , a de luxe establishment on Sugar Hill , remained open . Katharine Peckett had talked her father into the experiment , into a campaign of advertising , too , telling the world that there , in the Franconia Hills , winter-sports lovers could find their long-favored skating , tobogganing and snow-shoeing at the best . And , as an added attraction , Peckett 's offered a genuine Tyrolean skimeister , just imported from the Austrian Alps , to teach skiing , a sport then pretty well restricted to folks of Scandinavian origin , a few Northern college groups , and opulent Americans who had learned in Europe . Katharine Peckett 's dream of New Hampshire hillsides black with a skiing multitude has come true . Every winter week end finds from 30,000 to 40,000 streaking down the region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole up for the cold weather  --  they 're too busy running 253 hotels , lodges , inns , taverns and made-over private homes to shelter and feed a tired , hungry horde . Powder snow on a crusted base has become a cashable asset . Harvey D. Gibson 's famous $150,000 skimobile . He was swiftly and smoothly whisked to the top of Cranmore Mountain , that towers 1300 feet above the village of North Conway , probably the only town in the world to brag about its location in a " snow pocket " and advertise that it is buried in deep drifts from mid-December through April . Into the car immediately following Mr. Ford 's , and assisted with his skis just as courteously , stepped an eighteen-dollar-a-week shipping clerk . The automotive magnate was paying plenty for a cottage suite at the big hotel . The clerk was having a grand week end and , probably , a better time , on shoestring expenditure . Skiers of moderate income outnumbered the millionaires 4998 to two in the crowd on the slope that day . Harvey Gibson was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new concept in resort merchandising to jerk winter sports out of wealthy seclusion and put them within the economic reach of almost everybody . The merchandising concept was and still is based on the premise that there are more one-dollar than five-dollar hills floating around , and that ten ones add up to considerably more and are easier to get than one five . In fact , five dollars a day laid out for board and room today puts a winter visitor into the high-bracket spending class in the snow country . It rather isolates him from the elect in the skiing set . A city newspaperwoman , covering the ski towns on expense account  --  with no great incentive to keep costs down  --  testifies that it 's a problem to spend more than four dollars a day , including her keep , gas , movies and dances , and remain among the sort of people in whom her middle-class paper is interested Four dollars , even three dollars a day will buy an amazing amount and quality of comfort , hospitality and good food in the winter hills . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least ten to one . If he is willing to put up with four to six beds in a room , and get along with heaping platters of plain , home-cooked victuals , the snow follower can do himself well for two dollars a day . " It 's the low-priced , family-operated places that are always filled , " says Phil Randall , North Conway businessman turned Eastern Slope booster-in-chief . " These have shown the way to full houses to hotel-keepers . The result is reasonable prices everywhere . " Even big-town-hotel atmosphere , with lavish surroundings and service , is being brought within reach of an increasingly large number . To stay in the imposing caravansary in North Conway costs from nine to thirteen dollars a day  --  even higher per person if one demands a suite or private cottage for his party . But if the skier will bunk in one of the double-decker beds  --  installed two , four and six to the room  --  in the brand-new ski barracks smack beside the big hotel , he can eat his meals in state in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lobby , rub shoulders with the wealthy , and his bill will be five dollars a day , including meals . " You 've no idea how much easier it is to snare a five-dollar bill than a ten-dollar , up here in the winter , " comments Lester Sprague , the manager . Club life can be had , too --  and for little more than half of five dollars a day . It and Joe Dodge , " first citizen of the White Mountains , " mountaineer , pioneer winter sportsman , hero of a hundred thrilling rescues above timber line , are to be found before the massive stone fireplaces in the lodge at the Appalachian Mountain Club 's Pinkham Notch camp , where outsiders are as welcome as members . True , the guest must carry his own luggage , make up his own double-deck bunk , roll out at 6:30 A.M. , wax his own skis , and eat with the camp 's husky crew at the long tables . The bewhiskered old boy with the frost-bitten cheeks , beside him at the table , may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ski-trousered but charming young lady next to him in the penny-ante poker game in the ski room that night may be a debutante from Beacon Hill or a stenographer . Whoever becomes an accepted " regular " at Pink-ham Notch camp has entered the aristocracy of skidom . Here are found the heroes who run the treacherous Back Wall , over which the snows pile a hundred feet deep into Tuckerman Ravine , high on the side of Mount Washington -- where there 's skiing until the middle of June , sometimes into July . They scorn ski lows and open slopes and revel in long treks over rugged mountains , or sweeping down twisting trails that only experts dare run . If night catches them far from camp , they bed down snugly in one of the High Country cabins that the National Forest Service has spotted all over the White Mountain National Forest . The Federal foresters , with the aid of the CCC , have made this into a veritable skiers ' paradise , where nothing costs anybody a dime . Rendezvous for the Thrifty HE High Country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stocked with blankets , cooking range , heating stove and kitchen utensils . They 're never locked , free to all corners ( but wash the dishes before you leave ) . Many hardened snow slaves unload their car , park it at the foot of the trail , pack rations up to a High Country cabin , and ski out from there . Thirty-one of them crowded into one cabin last New Year 's Eve ; the men had to bunk in an " open-face " shelter outside , with a great fire blazing before it . Eating was in relays , but what a greeting young 1941 got that night . Probably the cheapest way to enjoy a skiing week end is to cook your grub in one of these cabins . Last Christmas vacation , a college group packed up to one of the smaller cabins . The girls slept in the hunks , the boys outside ( Continued on Page 101 ) in their sleeping bags . Everything worked out fine , except that they ate their four-day supply of rations the very first day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skiing horde during a White Mountain winter . A Littleton merchant testifies that his hotel customers buy just about half again as much per guest in winter as in summer . " The first breakfast , most of them are sure that their usual orange juice , slice of toast and coffee will be plenty , " says Edith Robertson , hostess at a Franconia ski lodge . But after that they 're reaching for everything on the table and yelling for more . " Long hours of exercise in the open air account for much of this capacity . But everywhere the quality of the food inspires appetite . Carroll Reed , pio ' , neer of low-cost ski instruction , insists that for stoking skiers no place in the world beats Mrs. Ed Moody 's , way back in the hills behind Jackson , where prices make staying at home seem expensive . It 's a simple farmhouse . Four and five to the room permit a total capacity of twenty . Huge platters and great bowls of food are set on the table and the crowd wades in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is New Hampshire farm cookery at its best . At Joe Dodge 's Pinkham Notch camp , capacity eighty , an ordinary breakfast menu  --  eat all you can hold , come back for seconds , thirds and fourths ? includes grapefruit , dry or hot cereal with milk or cream , toast , corn muffins , jam , marmalade , wheat , cakes with pure maple sirup , sausages , ' broiled bacon , coffee , tea or milk . Practically all of these serious skiers take out a trail lunch and stay on the hills all day . Back in camp at night , they dine on quantities of soup , roast meats , vegetables , salads , bread and butter , pies and puddings and beverages . The amount that eighty famished outdoor athletes can encompass is simply astounding . Pleasure for Jill Purses Mrs. Moody 's , whose place can be duplicated all through the snow country , and the Pinkham Notch camp , which would be unique were it not for the Dartmouth Outing Club lodge on the other side of the mountains , cater to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only blankets to roll up in and plenty of solid stokage . Most of the other places , though , are designed to take care of people not used to roughing it . Bill and Betty Whitney , skiers themselves , run an old-home sort of place , which is typical of scores , where guests can get their skiing without too much hard work . The farmhouse is big enough to shelter twenty-five guests . Waitresses give individual service at mealtime , in conventional tearoom surroundings . Maids make up the beds or bunks . Right behind the house is a steep hillside which , until mountain ski slopes were cut out , was the highest piece of cleared land in New Hampshire . An overhead tramway drags skiers to the top of the hill . Two years ago , the Whitneys wallboarded the loft of a long , shedlike structure running from the house to the barn , put in heat and toilet facilities , including shower baths , divided the place into two rooms , one for women , the other for men , and installed fourteen single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reduced prices a dollar a day for those sleeping in the new barracks . The ski-barracks idea has given accommodation to an increasingly wide range of winter-sports incomes . Barns , sheds , old country schoolhouses and deserted mills have been remodeled into barracks . The skiers have gone for them . Many who can afford to go where they wish , prefer the unconventional camaraderie that pervades the barracks , featuring a big lounge room with fireplace , table games , a library and plenty of comfortable chairs . The dignified New Hampshire air of comfort and hospitality , built up ever since summer residents and vacationists came with the first railroads , now is found functioning in the winter , too , and at moderate prices . Sam Thompson opened North Conway 's first hotel way back before the Civil IN'ar ; the family has stayed in the business ever since . His granddaughters , Edna Ricker and Mary Kinney , are caring for winter guests in three modernized mansions . Surely , Sam Thompson 's granddaughters would never care to give a tearoom atmosphere to their dining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tables . Workers of Economic Miracles The old village hotels , that used to slumber the winter through , have come to life , spruced up , laid on new paint and wallpaper , put in modernistic cocktail lounges , ski rooms and racks , have a sports hostess on duty from the first snowfall . Always famous for bountiful fare , they have n't abated a hit . Truly amazing economic miracles in four-month snow campaigns have been wrought , too , without recourse to established hostelries . Five young Boston working boys , the top salary among them twenty dollars a week , labor hard five days a week , skimp on spending ; Saturday and Sunday are their days of glory . For four years now , they 've been winter tenants of a rather woebegone cottage hard by the North Conway slopes , paying twenty dollars a month rent . Jointly , they own a jalopy of ancient vintage . They whack up on the cost of gas and provisions , do their own cooking . They 're even riding the skimobile now . They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them were put on the skimohile slopes safety patrol ; the pay , free use of the big lift . This year , all five have made the patrol . They could n't get more or better skiing were they highly paid business executives . An employees ' groupfrom a large Lynn , Massachusetts , industrial concern owns a rambling old farmhouse , with a fine cleared slope not a stone 's throw from the door ; bought it five years ago , when mountain properties were going for a song . They 've fixed up the place , furnished it with cast-off stuff collected at home , and employ a full-time cook . Summer vacations crowd the house with hikers , camera fiends , fishermen and mountain climbers . Winter week ends , it bulges with skiers , come up five and six to the car . They 're good skiers too . They picked two of their most promising members , sent them to school to Hannes Schneider , called the greatest of the Tyrolean skimeisters who have come to America . The pair came back , put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stem bogans , Christianias , stem and jump turns were child 's play . Such clubs are multiplying rapidly throughout the section . When Carroll Reed got the idea that has made the ski-school short cut to good siding available to the masses , he was lying in a mountain hospital , his back broken in a skiing accident , doomed never to walk again . But he did get back on his feet , brought over Benno Rybizka from the Tyrolean Alps . picked seven local farm boys with poor prospects of earning a living , put them under Benno 's tutelage . When the young fellows got good , Reed dinned into the ears of the natives that his own accident was the result of poor ski technique , that winter-sports enthusiasm would die if participants were n't made into good , safe skiers , finally sparked public interest to raise funds to send the boys to Austria to learn ski-school methods . " They 're good , just as good as the best Austrian teachers , " Reed avers , adding with a chuckle , " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tyrolean accent , which does n't hurt their standing with pupils . " Carroll Reed 's system called for large classes , low prices , and his school went over with a bang . But he 's out of the ski-school business now ; bought out by Harvey Gibson , the North Conway boy who went to the city , became New York 's youngest bank president , was named head of the great Manufacturers Trust Company when several banks combined , and found time , too , to mastermind the 11140 New York World 's Fair . Harvey Gibson has never lost fondness for his native village , has become the region 's benefactor during time off snatched from his banking job . He built the Cranmore skimobile , that brings as many as 10 , - , 1 skiers to North Conway of a week end , gave twenty young villagers work running it . He decided that ski schools should be a public operation in ski villages , so he bought Reed 's , put Hannes Schneider in charge , turned it over to the regional ski clubs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davis , look after visitors ' comfort , safety and entertainment , the opening of new slopes and the like , while a booster corporation handles the job of getting skiers in , under the Eastern Slope technique . Novice skiers , hopeful of becoming good , stormed Reed 's school . Six thousand lessons the first year , 10,000 the second , and when the clubs took over the number jumped to 12,000 , and , last year . to 20,000 ; the thing 's getting bigger and bigger . The reason is n't far to seek ; even an office boy can save up enough to take a course in skiing at the school  --  twelve two-hour lessons for ten dollars  --  and a graduate can get along on any slope . Native-born Chester ( " Chuck " Em-1 erson , former Dartmouth football , baseball and skiing star , and Noel Wellman , New Jersey industrialist , who came to Kearsarge to mend his shattered health by rest and has been busier than ever , ever since , have teamed up with Hannes Schneider and the school in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region on skis , and they 've just about done it . It has meant more than mere fun to some of the boys ; graduates of free skiing courses , they have become full-time paid instructors of ski classes all over the mountains . Many of the boys got their outfits through the munificence of seven freehanded but anonymous Eastern Slope citizens , who offered to equip youngsters who could n't afford to pay with outfits at the rate of 100 a year , and 4 have been exceeding that limit until ( Continued on Page 1061 // f Continued from Page 104 ) now they have few prospects left . The donors excuse their philanthropy by saying that making every White Mountain town a veritable ski village will bring in more visitors , add up to a profit in the long run . Nearly all the mountain towns agree , have made outfits easy to get by the boys and girls . Ski villages they 're becoming indeed , with ski hoots , snow trousers the accepted winter costume for men , women and children . And how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ junior program from the start and strives to teach them all he knows . The Tyrolean was visiting in his native land when Hitler 's Putsch caught him : it cost Harvey Gibson a lot of money and diplomatic wire-pulling to get the skimeister out . On the cold , star-studded winter night when he got back to North Conway , Hannes Schneider got his accolade from the boys and girls , his assurance that here were coming into being ski villages like his home town . Hundreds of red-checked youngsters from all the towns on the Eastern Slope were ranged in double line to greet . him , their upraised skis forming an archway for him to walk under , from the station , across the town square and up the main street to the big hotel . where the elders had gathered . The teamwork of small-town men , the ski-village atmosphere , safe slopes with patrols to warn the unwary , plenty of tows , winter sports at their best at prices that run-of-the-mill folks can afford to pay  --  they 're bringing thousands more to the mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to be dead loss . The Eastern Slope is frankly out for volume business , welcomes the snow trainers and the one-day automobile parties , delights in days like ode last winter , when three snow trains and a couple of thousand autos brought nearly 10,000 skiers to the skimobile slopes alone . The southern sections  --  Plymouth , Laconia , the Ossipee , Monadnock and Belknap Mountain areas  --  close to centers of population , are naturally out for one-day business too . Keeping the Skiers Happy But the Franconia section is n't so keen for snow trains and the skiers who do n't stay overnight . From North Woodstock and Lincoln up to Littleton , on the Western Slope , they 're out for the long week-ender and the guest who stays a week or two . Top prices over there average a little higher than on the Eastern Slope , but still a great deal of entertainment and skiing can be bought for very little money . Two insurance-company typists from Springfield , Massachusetts , spent a full week in Franconia . They found a room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bought their breakfasts and luncheons in a tearoom , but went overboard every evening for a full-course dinner at one of the good hotels . Two days they spent on Cannon Mountain , riding the nation 's only passenger-carrying aerial tramway to the top , running the ski trails down . The rest of the time they skied on slopes with rope tows , close to Franconia . They went skating three evenings , two they spent tobogganing . Ski-club dances accounted for their other two nights . Homeward bound , they totted up , found they had spent less than twenty-five dollars apiece . For that amount of money they had purchased everything in winter sports that a person of wealth could . The canny ski villagers provide plenty of evening entertainment , much of it free to all , the rest modestly priced . Nearly every town maintains a skating rink . Tobogganing brings townspeople and guests to near-by slopes and built slides , on some of which tows drag toboggan and riders to the top . Movies are in every town . Ski-club dances are held in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the week , some of them specializing in old-time square dances , others offering modern swing bands . Most of the week-end dances throw in a maple-sirup sugaring-off party during the intermission . An Unbroken Record The state-owned Cannon Mountain Aerial Tramway , running up the peak from which , for centuries , the Old Man of the Mountains has looked across Franconia Notch , is to the Franconia district what the skimobile is to the Eastern Slope . Nearly 60,000 skiers used the tramway last winter , rode to the top for fifty cents a trip and skied down for nothing . But none of them even at tempted to approach the record of the hustler who rode the skimobile to the summit of Cranmore Mountain , skied down thirty-one times in a single day . Par for the mile-long , 2000-foot lift up Cannon Mountain is four trips a day ; those are long trails from the summit down into the notch . This winter , though , most of the skiers are making only one full run a day down the mountain , the last one when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , installed last fall , from the 3200-foot level to the crest , after one trip up on the tramway ; get in up to eighteen miles a day downhill running , over the best skiing on the mountain . Up here , too , the spruces are tinseled with frost , and snow-decked vistas and long-distance panoramas lend glamour to the running . The Franconia district 's policy of concentrating upon the winter vacationist arid the lung week-ender is working out just as satisfactorily as the come-one-come-all plan of the Eastern Slope . The capacities of the listed hotels in its six villages total less than 950 , yet every week end finds twice that number staying over Saturday night ; rooms in private homes take in the overflow . Basket lunches are sent to guests spending the day on Cannon Mountain . An added attraction is the recreational area at the foot of the mountain , where the state maintains a score of fireplaces with grills and dry wood for fires . Almost daily , records for per-capita consumption of hot dogs and canned soups are broken around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may practice his woods cookery at the outdoor grills , or take lunch in the lodge at the top of the tramway . Snow trains are lots of fun , but they 're not the cheapest way to get in a day in the open air . In the early days of the skiing outbreak , the trains carried up to 5000 enthusiasts to the slopes every Sunday ; now the number has tapered off to a fairly consistent 1000 per Sunday , from Boston , Worcester , Springfield , Providence and New York , the last being an overnight trip . Open roads , with four or five to an auto to share the expense , enable motorists to beat even the $2.50 and $2.75 snow-train fares from Boston . In three hours , one Sunday morning last winter , on one main road , inspectors counted more than 1500 northbound motorcars equipped with ski racks , and carrying from two to five passengers each . The desirability of open roads in any weather , to bring skier cash into the state , has given New Hampshire a system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been called the best winter-highway maintenance in the world . For over five years the highway department has kept clean a record of not a single stoppage of traffic , even during blizzards that have deposited four feet of snow in the notches . They claim with pride that anyone can drive anywhere , safely , in any kind of weather . Still , open roads or not , a lot of skiers who own cars remain true to the snow trains , check their skis and poles at the station from week to week , never miss the Sunday trip . They claim that the ride , besides being a lot of fun in a congenial crowd , brings them , fresh and strong , to the slopes for their skiing , nerves unjangled by driving hazards . The occasional skier finds the snow train to be a real economy , for in its service car he can rent equipment at low rates . Snow trainers are steady patrons of the skimobile and other tows and lifts ; they want all the downhill running they can get before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests eat a lot more than summer folks , that it costs a great deal of money to heat the big places in cold weather and runs up a big electric-light bill , too , one wonders at finding winter rates for board and lodging far below summer charges . Roland Peabody , manager of the tramway , himself a native , long a grocer in Franconia , knowing the working of the shrewd Yankee mind , makes the reason clear . " Sound business common sense is behind it , " he holds . " Winter sports are an extra-budget expense to most families , not saved up for as summer vacations and tours are ; they ca n't come if it 's going to cost them a lot of money . We figure that if , by cutting margins close , we can get enough people to come up here and spend enough to enable us to pay our annual taxes , cost of insurance , the actual outlay for fuel and light , and the keep of the family , we 'll have done well enough for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That leaves summer profits real velvet . " That business policy works out to the advantage of everybody when the new winter cash gets to circulating . Eleven hotels , reporting in the Eastern Slope area , had winter receipts of $7266 in 1935 ; $114,155 in 1939 . Carl Chase , who runs a large lunch car in the square at North Conway , is serving three times as many meals every week end as all the restaurants in town , combined , did two years ago . Ed Warren , operating a gas station next door , has had to initiate twenty-four-hour service , keep three men on duty all the time ; three years ago he could take care of the business by himself . Cold Winter Brings Cold Cash One bank reports that its winter commercial deposits averaged $233,000 in 1934 , but $1,155,128 in 1939 . Milkmen report a 100 per cent increase in business . A small store in Jackson used to do about $400 worth of business during the four winter months ; last winter it sold $22$3 worth of goods . The Franconia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice since the new proprietor put in a wintersports-goods department . Over a five-year period , the winter monthly pay roll of a Plymouth garage has increased from $367 to $1654 . An electric-light company reports doubling of kilowatt-hour output from 1937 to 1939 . A restaurant man in Laconia sells 200 extra meals every Saturday and 300 every Sunday , during the winter-sports season . So the $2,000,000 extra outside money that the winter-sports army leaves with the 40,000-odd residents of the New Hampshire snow country adds up to all-around profit , pulls the winter out of the red . Soon , the forward-looking Yankees behind it believe , the spreading fame of the region with its reasonable charges , its combination of a hum snow season and fully equipped ski slopes , will be lu ringin winter vacationists from all over the East , make the midweek nearly as profitable as week ends are now . Indeed , one and two week bookings are showing a big jump this winter , with many large employers reporting that winter vacations are becoming more and more popular with their staffs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New Hampshire smalltowners have parlayed their deep snows into . " All we 've done is give people extraordinary value for their dollars , " says Phil Randall . " Do that and you 'll get along ? all right , whether you 're selling shoestrings or winter sports . "
