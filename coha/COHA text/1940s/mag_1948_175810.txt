The Senate completed the victory of the Air Force last week . By an overwhelming 74-to-2 vote , it passed a $3,198,000,000 appropriation to get the 70-group Air Force program started . Coupled with the House 's recent 343-to-3 endorsement of a similar bill , the Senate 's action was conclusive proof that Congress considered air power the nation 's first line of defense . <P> Only Senators Harry Cain of Washington and Glen Taylor of Idaho voted against it . Said Cain : " We 're trying to do too much-too fast . " Cried Taylor , running mate to Henry Wallace on the third party ticket : " When Wallace is elected President , we can reach an agreement with Russia and call off this whole armaments program . " <P> By its action , Congress rejected the recommendations of Defense Secretary James Forrestal , who had suggested a 66-group Air Force and a " balanced " military establishment ; e.g. , more ground troops to support overseas air bases . Forrestal never made too good a case . Air Secretary Stuart Symington , pleading for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time in eight years on the tricky playing fields of Washington that Forrestal had lost the ball on a fumble . <P> Not Comical . Some Congressmen felt uneasy over having to repudiate Forrestal . But they blamed the National Defense office for the situation more than they blamed themselves . Said Massachusetts ' Senator Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. : " No satisfactory method at present exists to resolve the differences between the armed services and to produce an intelligent and integrated plan . . . The Secretary of Defense , although an extremely competent official , is so lacking in professional help that he can not possibly resolve the differences . What happens ? The controversy is passed on to Congress and we here are thus required to resolve a technical dispute between professionals . It is utterly preposterous and would be comical if the consequences were not so dangerous . " There was a move on foot to revise the law to strengthen the Secretary 's hand . <P> Anxious Moments . The legislation covered $1,651,000,000 which the Administration had marked down in the 1948-49 budget for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on second thought , plus $822 million Congress thought should be added . The total $3,198,000,000 would be divided up at roughly a 70-30 ratio between Air Force and Navy air arm . <P> Still to be voted on was the rest of next year 's military budget-now a big proposed $11.6 billion . Congress might knock out some items , such as the 80,000-ton carrier which the Navy yearned for . Congress was less than likely to pass universal military training , which was down for $400 million . But in the end the total defense appropriations would be around $14 billion , which was even more than the Finletter Commission , in its most anxious moments four months ago , had thought necessary for national defense . There were no bargains , yet , in defense .
