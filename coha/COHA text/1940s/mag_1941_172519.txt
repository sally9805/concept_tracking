Wheat prices rose 3 to 5 a bushel last week to the highest level since May 1940 ; corn rose ? to 1 to new peaks since August 1938 ; and cotton rose 67 to 74 points ( $3.35 to $3.70 a bale ) to four-year highs . The double-headed reason : The House passed the Fulmer Bill making crop loans of 75% of parity prices* mandatory , and the Senate Agricultural Committee unanimously approved 85% loans . The existing law gives the Secretary of Agriculture discretion between 52% and 75% of parity , and present loans were made on the basis of what was 52% of parity when the rate was fixed . <P> Washington dopesters figure the House and the Senate will compromise . On the basis of today 's parity , 75% to 85% rates would mean 1941 crop loans to farmers from 85.5 to 96.9 a bushel on wheat ( present loan 64 ) ; 62.1 to 70.3 on a bushel of corn ( now 61 ) ; and 12.0 to 13./a pound on cotton ( now 8.5 ) . <P> Unless President Roosevelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probable result is that the Government , which is now financing almost half a year 's supply of wheat , about a quarter of a year 's supply of corn , and 18 months ' domestic supply of cotton , will shortly be in even deeper . <P> <P> *Parity prices are the average price for the last five years before World War I , adjusted upwards to reflect the increase in the cost of things the farmer has to buy .
