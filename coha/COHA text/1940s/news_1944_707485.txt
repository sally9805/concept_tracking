txt Things Were Different Then This morning I saw a public-spirited citizen clearing slush away from a corner sewer opening at Murray Street and West Broadway , a most unusual sight , and rivers pouring therein from two directions . Down by the Custom House a street cleaner was actually clearing a crossing , but his side kick was busy clearing the sidewalk inside the little Bowling Green Park , where nobody would wish to walk . All other crossings thereabout were practically impassable . So the slush was melting all day , with nowhere for the water to run . It will probably freeze , and we 'll have the mess with us for weeks . Do you remember the good old days when everyone cleared his gutter " the width of a shovel " or he got a call from the cop on the beat ? WILL . Cross , New York . Jan. 4 , 1944.
