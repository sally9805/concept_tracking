txt Substantiating at least one phase of the August grand jury 's pressntment , that prostitution and ' venereal disease were rife in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section , Brooklyn 's " Little Harlem , " Commissioner of Health Dr. Ernest L. Stebbins in a report to Mayor La Guardia yesterday afternoon disclosed that there were approximately 10,000 recorded cases of syphilis in the area in the last five years , an average of 2,000 a year . The tuberculosis death rate in the wide belt that stretches across the neck of the borough and embraces twelve square miles , is four times higher than in the rest of the city , exclusive of Harlem , Dr. Stebbins also revealed . These disclosures were made public by the Mayor himself as part of a report on the progress of plans , approved a month ago , for a health center at 1301-05 Fulton Street , in the heart of the Bedford-Stuyvesant section . Never Neglected , Says Mayor The Mayor emphasized that plans for improving the section , along with other sections of the city , have been under way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the grand jury 's charges , declared that Dr. Stebbins ' report " shows that conditions in the BedfordStuyvesant section have never been neglected by any city departlment . " Dr. Stebbins recalled that the Mayor had included in the master plan for the development of health centers a center for the Bedford larea ; that in addition , in 1942 , the Mayor approved a substation for the section , and that at his , the Mayor 's suggestion , " because of the increasing needs for that area , " he had undertaken " a detailed survey of health needs in Bedford , particularly in that area above Atlantic Avenue . " " Plans for improving this section , " the Mayor declared , " were in progress , along with every other section of the city , over a year ago in addition to the constant improvement during the past ten years . " This is because of the action of the Health Department in knowing of the actual cases . If the Health // DISEASE RAVAGES LITTLE HARLEM ' // Department had not been doing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venereal cases . " Dr. Stebbins said that his survey , carried out in the past nine months , " showed serious public health problems in this area . " He continued : " For example , the tuberculosis 1death rate in the district is significantly higher than the rest of the city . Moreover , the tuberculosis death rate in the health areas above Atlantic Avenue is approxiImately three times that of the rest 1of the city and approximately four times that of the rest of the city , exclusive of Harlem . Venereal Rate Unusually High " The venereal disease rate is unusually high , with approximately 10,000 cases of syphilis reported during the past five years . " In view of these and other evidences of unusual public health problems in this particular area , you approved approximately one month ago the immediate and emergency development of additional health facilities . In accord-ance with your approval , a tenta-tive site for the development of health services from this area was selected at 1301-1305 Fulton Street in Brooklyn . " At the present time in the Budget Director 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the development of the project and for the necessary limited funds for this center , including venereal disease clinic , tuberculosis clinic , child health station and the necessary nursing and sanitary personnel . " ? . s soon as this new district center can be equipped and opened it is our plan to assign to it one of our experienced health officers who has been , given special training by the Health Department . " Meanwhile it was reported , but not confirmed , that the six high police officials who conducted the survey ordered by the Mayor following the grand jury presentment on which Commissioner Valentine 's report to the Mayor was based , would be summoned before the grand jury when it convenes again on Dec. 6 . These reports also had the Mayor and Commis- ? moiler Valentine again being summoned as witnesses . Mr. Valentine was before that body on his last appearance on Tuesday for an hour and a half . He was the sole witness that day . The grand jury , it was said , would make a full study of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. Belford , pastor of the Roman Catholic Church of the Nativity , Madison Street and Classon Avenue , Brooklyn , commenting on the Valentine report , said he believed the grand jury present- , ment , which blamed the Mayor and the Police Department for failing to curb alleged widespread lawizssness in the area , was " fair and reliable . " In outspoken fashion , the priest said the issue was whether the police were unfetterd and in a position to take remedial action or whther they had to abide by orders from the Mayor . " I think , " he said , " the situation boils down to this  --  is the Police Department really free to do what it thinks it ought to do , or does it get its orders from City Hall ? " Patrolman David Liebman , whose talk at the mass meeting of the Midtown Civic League last Sunday while on vacation and in civilian clothes led to racial recriminations and his subsequent suspension by Commissioner Valentine , yesterday sought out Mgr . Belford , who was also a speaker , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him , was the best of the meeting , ' but the priest said he also told Liebman that he thought he erred in expressing what could be con- , strued as criticism of the Police Department . Mgr . Belford likewise said he did not think there was anything in the patrolman 's speech to give offense and that he believed Liebman used the word " sun- , burned " in referring to Negroes in a light vein . Mgr . Belford took occasion to remark that he himself had been criticized recently by Negroes as being anti-Negro . He said he was not anti-Negro , but that he was opposed to " bad behavior , " whether1 by white persons or Negroes . Sumner A. Sirti , head of the Mid-1 town Civic League , who presided at the stormy mas , , . , meeting , yesterday declared the Valentine report was " definitely made and timed to offset the presentment of the August grand jury and the expected report of the July grand jury on conditions in Brooklyn . " Certainly , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police protection and the lack of enforcement of the law are largely responsible for the lawless condition . " The July grand jury has been reported ready for a week to issue a presentment of its own on crime conditions in the borough . Generally supervising the survey ordered by the Mayor which was conducted by 420 policemen was Chief Inspector John J. O'Connell . The five other police officials who made reports were Deputy Chief Inspector Michael J. Murphy , on bars and grills ; Inspectors William P. O'Brien and Conrad H. Rothengast , on suspected premises ; Deputy Inspector George Mitchell , dealing with church closings , and Deputy Inspector William M. Kent , reporting for the Juvenile Aid Bureau that he heads . Police in the survey covered 691 buildings in the area in thirty-two of which the investigating officers reported there was suspicion of prostitution . The August grand jury presentment came in for severe censure at the hands of the board of directors of the New York City Chapter of the National Lawyers Guild , at a special meeting held on Wednesday . The Guild , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirety " does violence to basic concepts of orderly administration of justice and paves the way for incitement and provocation . " It condemned the grand jury for failing to examine the " basic social and economic handicaps which the Negro people in the area are compelled to suffer , " and declared the grand jury 's advocacy of " muss ' em up " tactics on the part of police to suppress lawbreakers to be " unconstitutional .
