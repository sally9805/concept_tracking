" Did you ever hear of a werewolf ? Did you ever hear of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde ? I 'm like him-two personalities . " <P> That was the only way that Private Edward Leonski , 24-year-old New York grocery-boy-draftee with the U.S. Signal Corps in Australia , knew how to defend himself . It was not enough to convince a medical board of two Army physicians and an Australian alienist . They declared that Leonski was sane and always had been . Last week an Army tribunal , sitting in Melbourne , sentenced him to be hanged . <P> The Army verdict was that Leonski was a " fiend , " whose barehanded strangulation of three Melbourne women " cast a foul blot on the service . " But there were two other theories about Leonski , one of which may still save him from the gallows . <P> Theory A. To alibi his murders , Leonski talked to tentmates of his split personality . When he had a few drinks he even walked wolflike on his hands and knees to build up his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart , who was responsible for the horrors he committed . This theory the medical board quickly exploded . Leonski was not a schizophrenic . <P> Theory B. The second theory was advanced by Dr. Frederic Wertham , New York criminal psychiatrist , on new research presumably not available yet in Australia . In Dr. Wertham 's psychiatric terminology , the Leonski case was that of catathymic crisis resulting from the same mother fixation which plagued Shakespeare 's Hamlet , which for centuries has driven certain types of thwarted men to kill the thing they love the most . Leonski , according to Dr. Wertham , was a lonely , heartsick tenement boy suddenly deprived of all sense of comfort and personal love . Under these circumstances the inhibitions piled up from the time he was a little boy , when his sister said , " He was so good he used to scare me , " drove him to one of the rarest and least understood forms of murder-symbolic matricide . Without being aware of it , he wanted to kill his mother . With his mother 10,000 miles away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Leonski met Mrs. Ivy McLeod , 40 , on May 3 . This is the story he told investigators : <P> " I started to walk up the street and saw a girl in the doorway . She had a bag . She said something and smiled , and I said something about her bag . I walked over and felt of it . It was very soft . <P> " She stepped back in the doorway and I followed her , and grabbed her by the neck . . . and I choked her . <P> " She fell and I fell on top of her . I started to rip her clothes . I ripped them and ripped them . But I could n't rip her belt , so I left it and came back to it . <P> Then I went mad , and I thought ' I 've got to rip it . ' I ripped it and ripped it . " <P> Victim No. 2 was Mrs. Pauline Thompson , 31 , whom Leonski met on May 9 . " I remember a woman singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a nice voice . We came to a long flight of stone steps , and I grabbed her by the throat . I wanted her to keep on singing . I choked her . How could she keep on singing when I choked her ? " Later he said : " Fancy my being a murderer ! I guess that Thompson girl was the hardest . She was strong and , oh boy , could she drink gin squashes ! She told me I had a baby face , but I am wicked underneath . "
