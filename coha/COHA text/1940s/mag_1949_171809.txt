When young ( 37 ) G. Mennen Williams , onetime Princeton oarsman , surprised himself and his fellow Democrats by getting elected governor of Michigan last November , the C.I.O. hurriedly set out to help him run the state . Personable " Soapy " Williams , a New Dealing Grosse Pointe socialite ( and an heir to the Mennen shaving-cream fortune ) soon had a press secretary handpicked by U.A.W. Chieftain Walter Reuther , and a batch of other officers who had been blessed by the C.I.O. Political Action Committee . Considering that the C.I.O. ( 530,000 dues-paying members in Michigan ) was the biggest group to support him in the campaign , Governor Williams thought it was the thing to do . <P> After teaching Williams the secret grip and tattooing him with the mystic symbol , the C.I.O. set out to bring Michigan 's Democratic Party into the lodge , too . This involved rescuing it from the A.F.L. ( who controlled the Michigan delegation to the Democratic National Convention ) and from jealous old-line party members who showed an unrealistic persistence in demanding space on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all out was smart , amiable August Scholle , 44 , longtime president of the State C.I.O. Council , and one of Walter Reuther 's close friends . His influence was soon felt . A committee of properly indoctrinated Democrats last week held a state convention at Grand Rapids . <P> State Chairman . John R. Franco , a party wheelhorse , was not consulted . When he arrived to protest , he found that it was too late to do anything-the convention was dominated by August Scholle . <P> While Soapy Williams watched from the sidelines ( his law partner , Hicks Griffiths , was named to replace Franco ) , Scholle pulled the strings . All Democratic candidates for the spring elections were hand-picked by the C.I.O. By moving smartly , new Boss Scholle had made the Democratic Party in Michigan a political arm of the C.I.O.
