One glittering night last week . Manhattan 's theatregoers offered to pay up to $50 a seat to get into the venerable Belasco Theatre . They went to sit through something Chicago had been howling over for 33 weeks : John Barrymore , the Waning Profile , making a travesty of a play that travestied his own career . In a sense they were disappointed . My Dear Children was definitely not up to the low standard it attained in Chicago ( TIME . Nov. 6 ) . <P> Barrymore 's burlesque of himself proved more bumpy than bumptious , his ad libs flabbier than flip . But he did let go a few Royal Family burps , and enough offside lines to indicate that this Jerry Horwin-Catherine Turney farce might yet be " good theatre , " with old John really strutting his stuff . <P> As Barrymore took his curtain call-his first in Manhattan after 17 prodigal years-an unemployed Hamlet from Brooklyn , in long Hamlet pants , leaped to the stage . After he was hustled off , Barrymore returned to report : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat upon by the fattest electrician in New York . ' ' <P> Meanwhile a determined young woman hustled out of her third-row seat and trailing her foxy furs , headed backstage . She was , as most of the audience knowingly noted , darkling Elaine Barrie , the lipsticky , 25-year-old tyro-wife whom 57-year-old John had spanked out of My Dear Children 's ingnue lead and into the divorce courts last April . <P> Backstage , Elaine breezed into John 's dressing room . Barrymore 's ( and Poetess Michael Strange 's ) pretty young daughter , Diana , who had hoped to guard Papa from mischief this trip , was floored . " I ca n't stand any more . . . " she wailed . " This is the end . " <P> But it was only Scene I. After 35 minutes with John , Elaine said she must be going . " John . " purred she , " it might be embarrassing to you and to me , too , if we happened to meet in public . You tell me where you 're going after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " John took the whole hook &; line . <P> Sure enough , into Fefe 's Monte Carlo , where John sat sipping with Daughter Diana and Stage Daughter Doris Dudley ( who succeeded Elaine in the play ) , swept Elaine . She sat at a table close to John 's . Doris and Diana bristled . When Diana got up to dance , Elaine slipped into Diana 's chair . The Monte Carlo crowd cocked eyes , cupped ears for Scene II . " All I want is 24 hours with you . " Elaine implored . " I do n't want you for keeps , John , but I must have you back for a little while . All I want is 24 hours of bliss . Look at me , John . " John looked . Elaine the Eyeful was wearing a slinky , low-cut gold mesh gown . John bussed her zestfully . Diana scrammed . Shortly afterwards John and Elaine left . They went to the Hotel Navarro . Fifteen blissful hours later . John emerged . Cocking a baggy but eloquent eye , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "
