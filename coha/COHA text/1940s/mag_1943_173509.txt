Less than three years ago , boyish , trigger-tempered Ted Nelson , 36 , was an $11-a-day welder in San Francisco 's Mare Island Navy Yard . His financial resources hardly bulged his vest pocket . Last week Ted Nelson , in his own spick- &; - span new $330,000 San Leandro plant , received an Army-Navy E , topped off the celebration by announcing the opening of a second plant in Camden , NJ. in a few months . He had skyrocketed up on a Buck-Rogerish invention of his own , aptly dubbed the " rocket gun . " <P> California-born Ted Nelson started slowly . After graduating from high school , he spent some 15 years picking up mechanical know-how in machine shops . He finally landed in the Mare Island Yard as a welder . There he fell afoul of a problem that had puzzled the best welding minds for 20 years : the problem of conveniently welding short , pencil-like pieces of metal to perpendicular or overhead surfaces . <P> Devise a Trick . Earlier welding guns could be used only on horizontal plates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dumped on the plate and fused by electricity to attach the " stud . " But on perpendicular plates there was no way to keep the flux in place . Instead , a small square of " welding pad " had to be laboriously welded , then the stud welded to that . Ted Nelson wearied of doing this , finally worked out a crude welding gun to make the job easier . But when he got " no thanks nor extra dough " he quit , and set to work perfecting his gun in a shop behind his home at Vallejo . His simple solution : encase the flux in a small cap and fasten it to the end of the stud . When the stud was loaded into his 7-lb. gun and the trigger pulled , a spring snapped the stud against the steel plate , electrically welding it in a trice . <P> Inventor Nelson began to make guns in his garage . At once he found a feverish market for them in the coast 's mushrooming shipyards-at $500 apiece . Reason : with the old method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours ; with the rocket gun , 1,000 . ( A Liberty ship has 10,000 studs to hold hangers for wireways and pipes , plastic decking , etc. in place . The C-4 has 55,000 . ) <P> Collect the Profits . The gun soon blasted out of its garage home , forced Nelson to incorporate as the Nelson Specialty Welding Equipment Corp . He borrowed $95,000 from RFC , put up a new plant in a San Leandro cornfield . Soon he was supplying guns to 120 shipyards . <P> He soon found that the big profit was in selling his patented studs . He began to hand out a new model of his gun to old customers on a replacement basis for $50 - the actual cost of materials . In the last 19 months , Ted Nelson 's profits have been a fat $407,000 , all plowed back into plant expansions and repayment of loans . <P> But he still spends 16 hours a day in the shop , still dresses in shopworker 's tan pants and shirts , still blows up in rocket-hot cussing over new problems . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep up the small cottage he and his wife live in near the plant . His 150 workers are paid $350 to $400 a month . Looking at the whopping $4,000,000 business the rocket gun is doing annually , Ted Nelson has no worries about the present , few about the future .
