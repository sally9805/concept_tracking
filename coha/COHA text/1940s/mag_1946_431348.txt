 | Hysterectomy ? removal of the womb ? is a serious operation . Any operation in which the abdomen is opened and some organ is removed is serious . Hysterectomy , luckily , is now so frequent that surgeons , through wide experience , have reduced the mortality rate until it is little higher than that in removal of the appendix . Many women have had this operation . They are in their early forties , and for the most part they are healthy and happy . Their operations have not made them either withered hags or abandoned wives . On the contrary , for they underwent surgery to , remedy a weakening condition , to avoid becoming that scourge of husbands ? an ailing female . By far the most frequent reason for this operation is that benign tumors have developed in the uterus . There are several other conditions , such as malignant growths or cancers , a disease called " endometriosis " ? inflammation of the lining of the womb with overgrowth of tissue ? bleeding due to disordered glands , or indeed any bleeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation may be the ultimate treatment . A woman has menstrual disturbances . First the periods are prolonged and profuse . Then , one day , perhaps , the bleeding assumes the proportions of a hemorrhage . This is frightening , of course . She consults a gynecologist . He sends her promptly to the hospital for curettement , for two reasons : to stop the bleeding and for diagnosis . Curettement is scraping of the uterus lining with a special instrument , so that the doctor can examine the tissue with a microscope . This tells whether or not there is any malignancy . Probably a small fibroid tumor is the cause of the trouble . This is not serious ; but after six months the doctor will reexamine the woman . Perhaps , before the half-year has passed , her menstrual periods become so prolonged there are only a few days between them , and the bleeding becomes so profuse that it interferes with her activities . Moreover , she becomes anemic , catches colds easily , and develops nagging infections . So the doctor decides to do something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Usually there is nothing imperative about it ; it can be delayed for months or even years , for benign tumors are n't fatal . But they can grow to such proportions that they complicate the operation seriously , and they can make life a dreary dragging of one foot after the other . Consequently it is best to get the operation over with . When the doctor operates , he removes the uterus and takes away all the cervix except the outer ring . This is a subtotal hysterectomy . He might decide , once he has made his incision , that a total hysterectomy is indicated , and so remove not only the uterus but the whole of the cervix . The first is simpler and less serious , but the doctor can not know in advance what he must do , and every case is different . Whichever he does is his problem , and whether the patient emerges with all or part of the cervix does not matter . The surgeon does not remove either the Fallopian tubes , which carry the ova from the ovary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If they show evidence of disease , he excises them . However , he leaves all or part of one or both ovaries if he possibly can , for he never interferes with ovarian function unless it is absolutely necessary , The ovaries are such an important part of the glandular system that their complete removal is likely to cause a glandular imbalance , and it would take the system a long time to readjust . After hysterectomy , the patient remains in the hospital two weeks . Many doctors let their patients go home after ten or eleven days , but this is @#  | usually because hospital beds are in desperate demand . All in all , it is not too bad . After a couple of days of gas pains , which are unpleasant but not unbearable , the patient merely lies quietly and begins to recover . Complications do sometimes follow this operation , even in the hands of the most competent and experienced surgeons . The bladder occasionally sustains injury during the freeing of the uterus and cervix ; but such laceration of the bladder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total hysterectomy the ureter may be damaged or disturbed , and this demands careful attention . However , expert gynecologists take measures to avoid such consequences . Usually a general anesthetic is used . If the patient is fat , the doctor may request spinal anesthesia . If she is very fat indeed , he may insist that she take off some flesh before going to the hospital . This facilitates the operation and reduces risks . Under certain circumstances , the surgeon performs the operation through the vagina , the opening from the uterus to the outside . The doctor does this when his patient is elderly or obese and might not be able to stand the strain of the abdominal incision ; for this type of hysterectomy is not nearly so great a shock to the system . In the hands of a good surgeon , it is extremely successful . But he must be absolutely certain of his patient 's condition , for he must work more by touch and he can not see whether there is anything unusual . He can not use this method to remove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adhesions or any other complications . When selected with knowledge of all the conditions , however , the vaginal operation is highly satisfactory ; but it is bad business when the patient , not the doctor , decides on it ! The doctor may , however , give a choice hysterectomy or irradiation , by X-ray as radium . Irradiation has disadvantages as well as advantages . It requires only about forty-eight hours  | in the hospital . It does not cost nearly so much time and money as surgery . But its liabilities , most doctors believe , gravely outweigh these attractive features . First , irradiation not only halts the bleeding and the growth of a tumor , but it also may destroy ovarian function , something the doctor always wants to avoid . Second , while it is not actually proved , some doctors express the fear that cancer of the uterus may develop after this type of treatment . Disturbances of the intestinal tract , which may follow the use of irradiation , may make the patient more miserable than surgery , and for more weeks than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at some later date , the tumor may begin to grow again , and the same situation must be faced once more . The cautious doctor rarely advises radium or X-ray except in cases of poor operative risks . Removal of the uterus does not cause " surgical menopause . " The menopause is normal . Removal of the uterus puts an end to the menstrual function and naturally makes childbearing impossible ; but it does not in any way interfere with the ovarian functions . The ovaries go right on doing their work according to plan . With or without the uterus , the ovaries function normally and taper off naturally in their function until their job is done and they cease to act . It is the functioning or non-functioning of the ovaries that governs the menopause ; the uterus has nothing to do with it . IF THE surgeon is obliged to remove the ovaries , as he sometimes is , the situation is different . This causes a drastic and sudden revision in a glandular system designed to change slowly , adapting itself to change by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of ductless glands ; surgical removal is so swift that the related glands do not have an opportunity to adjust . This is the reason for the acute symptoms of artificial menopause , and it is also the reason the doctor leaves at least part of one ovary if it is at all feasible , for even a portion of an ovary is a great help . Indeed , a small part of one ovary is enough to make it possible for a woman still to bear healthy children . There is , however , no evading the fact that an artificial menopause is a trying experience . The manifestations begin to appear within perhaps a week or ten days after the operation . The normal menopausal symptoms of irritability , poor sleep , depression , vasomotor disturbances may be exaggerated . The hot flushes may be frequent and trying . The doctor may give a sedative , and he advises rest and fresh air ; but he does not give hormones unless the symptoms are serious . If the mental depression verges on neurosis ; if weakness or dizziness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they make the woman an invalid , he may give hormones in small quantity for short periods . The symptoms of surgical menopause , like those of a normal change of life , do not go on forever . After some months they disappear and are forgotten . Hysterectomy is a major operation , more serious than an appendectomy or a hernia operation . It takes time to get over the operation , for muscles do not knit and strengthen overnight . It takes quite a while for Nature to do her work . And the patient must cooperate . She should not move around too much at first  | or lift anything heavier than a teacup for a bit . She must get plenty of rest and avoid fatigue . At the first sign of fatigue she must pause and rest . She should nap an hour or so after lunch , and go to bed early ? not later than ten-thirty . She should have breakfast in bed , and make her toilet slowly . When she goes out , she should walk only a block at first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should do everything at half-speed . If she is careful , eight or ten weeks after she goes home from the hospital she can drive a car , clean the house , do almost anything except move the grand piano . In this way she can regain her strength and health and return to a normal life within a very few months . If she tries to be Superwoman , she must pay the price . She wo n't feel human for a much longer time ; her disposition will be far from equable ; small things will annoy her ; she may burst into tears when the gravy is n't just right . She will tire quickly and feel far from hearty for months or even years . So it is much better to go slow . At first , the stomach may bulge and sag , because the abdominal muscles have lost tone as a result of long relaxation . But that slim silhouette will return . The doctor probably will suggest a comfortable girdle to prevent spreading and to support the back . As for marital relations ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married life . Most gynecologists insist that their patients refrain until all the organs have healed and regained strength ; but the time varies according to individuals and sometimes according to doe-ors ' own attitudes . Some doctors permit relations a month after the operation , if all is well ; others only after examination three or four weeks after the patient goes home from the hospital . Even though hysterectomy is serious , the patient eventually is her normal self rain ? and need not worry . She 'll find life brighter than ever .
