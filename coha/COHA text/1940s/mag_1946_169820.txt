Dictator Francisco Franco , like Dictator Stalin ( see below ) , saw hostile foreigners around every corner . Last week he felt a sudden surge of claustrophobia . <P> At Segovia , the plump little Caudillo told 3,000 lean Spaniards that , just by looking at them , he could see they were " really short of nourishment . " He blustered : " It is the fault of outside nations which deny us many things . " Franco 's solution : " If we ca n't progress looking outward , then we 'll progress looking inward . " <P> Certainly the outside world was none too friendly . Same day in London , the General Assembly condemned Franco 's regime , barred Spain from UNO , 45-to-0.
