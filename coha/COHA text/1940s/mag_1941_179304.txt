Is there a national emergency or is there not ? With fear &; trembling the House confronted this question-a question in the form of a bill to extend the service of draftees in the Army . <P> If the U.S. actually were in danger , and the danger could be shown , the bill would pass like a shot ; draftees would stay in the Army indefinitely . If no danger could be clearly demonstrated , the bill might fail , the half-baked U.S. Army would lose its half-baked soldiers , would have to start from the beginning again with completely raw recruits . <P> The Senate had already passed a bill extending service for 18 months ; but the Senate had not answered the big question . Isolationist after Isolationist had stood up and shouted that he wanted to be shown : Where was the emergency ? Less loudly , less cogently the Administration 's leaders had tried to prove that the peril to the U.S. was immense and soon might be immediate . They lost the argument but passed the bill ; enough middle-roaders went along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten Senators ducked a vote , were " ill , " " out of town " or just-away ) . <P> Of the 30 Nay voters , 23 were confirmed Isolationists who had also voted against the Lend-Lease Bill and against nearly every Roosevelt-sponsored measure relating to foreign policy . Against the Lend-Lease Bill they had argued that the U.S , was quite capable of defending itself alone . Now they argued that going-it-alone did not necessarily include creating a big , well-trained Army , certainly did not include sending arms to Soviet Russia , California 's irreconcilable Isolationist , old ( 74 ) Senator Hiram Johnson , shouted in a throbbing voice : " I will not subscribe to the doctrine that you must be a Stalinite to be an American . . . . Good God ! Did we ever sink so low before as to choose one cutthroat out of two ? This man was Hitler 's ally . . . . Now we furnish him with weapons which may be turned upon us . " <P> In the House , the bill 's fate teetered on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the argument would have to be won . The House leaders faced up to their task with no great conviction . Only a month ago Speaker Sam Rayburn himself had stated that to keep the draftees past their year 's enrollment was a breach of contract . Now he had changed his mind : he had been convinced that there was a national emergency ; whether he could convince enough of his fellows remained to be seen . The Senate had beaten down attempts to make the extension for only six months ( proposed by Ohio 's Robert Taft ) , for only twelve months ( Ohio 's Harold Burton ) , had finally agreed on 18 months and a limited declaration of " national peril . " House leaders privately feared that the best they could hope for was a six-months ' extension . The Isolationists , supposedly on the defensive , were smiting their opponents hip &; thigh . <P> Editorial writers throughout the land pointed out that Congress was getting itself out on a creaky limb . If Russia were suddenly to go down before the Nazis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Congress would be in a fix much worse than mere embarrassment . Hitler would then have all of Europe and a big chunk of Asia . And the U.S. would be armed only with the tongues of its Congressmen.
