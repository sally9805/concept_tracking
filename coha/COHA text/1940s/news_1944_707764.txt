txt Religious and civic leaders opened last night the drive for the $4,500,000 needed to . fill the gap between the endowments and other income that provide the principal support of member organizations of the Greater New York Fund and the entire sum required for this year . Gathered at the Hotel Astor for the opening campaign dinner , 1,400 campaign workers heard a message from Governor Dewey and addresses by James A. Farley , former Justice Edward Lazansky and fund officials emphasizing the urgency and importance of homefront tasks handled by the New York Fund . The appeal is directed exclusively to business concerns and employe , groups and seeks to raise only a comparatively small percentage- of the $81,250,000 annual needs of the 406 voluntary hospitals , health and welfare agencies benefiting from the New York Fund . These agencies have a collective income of their own from fees , investments and endowments of $59,000,000 annually . Their own appeals are able to raise $17,750 , - 000 of the $22,250,000 difference . From Governor Dewey came recognition of the heavy strain on the public 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red Cross drives and income ' taxes . Coriceding that such demands were " indeed numerous , " the Governor 's message nevertheless characterized the Greater New York Fund as " a primary obligation and privilege . " He said our ability to support properly American fighting men overseas Was in direct ratio to ' maintaining the health of the home front on the highest possible level , and added : " One of the oldest expressions of the primary obligation of citizenship in a free republic is the legitimate concern of one man for the welfare of his neighbor . The people of Greater New York will , I I am sure , not fail in this responsibility . " Mr. Farley reminded that homefront needs could be as pressing as those of oppressed peoples in foreign lands . " With death and destruction rampant abroad , " he said , " our hearts go out in deep sympathy to the innocent victims of hatred and aggression across the sea . It 's only right and natural that we should support suffering humanity wherever it may be . But let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember that by working for the success of this campaign you are making a definite contribution to the war effort . " Only a people strong in morale can offer a united front against the enemies of democracy . It would not be right that we pass up the appeal for our home-front needs . " Mr. Farley emphasized the unselfish , nonpartisan nature of the fund 's work , pointing out that the organizations receiving support from the fund existed not only for the poor , sick , lame , halt and blind but for all New Yorkers , giving help annually to 2,000,000 persons , or two out of every seven residents of New York City . Sketches Are Presented Before the speaking , outstanding radio artists presented " My Story , " consisting of eight typical stories of persons who had been helped by a member agency of the Greater New York Fund . Westbrook Van Voorhis of " The March of Time " was commentator ; the show was produced by Yasha Frank with a cast assembled by the Columbia Broadcasting System ; sound equipment was furnished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Radio City Music Hall was stage manager . Another special guest was Robert Sherrod , correspondent for Time and Life Magazines , who related his experiences at Tarawa and in other Pacific battle areas . He said the average soldier wanted more than anything else " to have his people realize what war is like , what sacrifices he and his comrades are having to make before victory is achieved . " Observing that we are " only beginning to fight the Japanese , " Mr. Sherroe said the enemy in the Far East figured Americans had no heart for war and that concessions might be made before the ultimate objective of Tokyo was reached . " For the Japanese any concession would be a victory upon which to build another war for another generation of Americans , " he declared . " Most American fighting men in the Pacific realize this . Most of them are willing to sacrifice anything , even their lives , to crush Japan utterly , to prevent that other war for another generation . " Arthur A. Ballantine , president of the Greater New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had " established a permanent place for itself in the community life of New York City . " " You volunteers , " he added , " have the blessing of our Governor . The Mayor of our city has consented to act as honorary chairman of our campaign , and the highest executives of our great corporations and business institu ? bons are heart and'soul behind it . " J. Stewart Baker , general chairman of the 1944 New York Fund , commended those who have volunteered to head the drives in the various boroughs . They include Charles J .. Stewart , Manhattan ; Philip A. Benson , Brooklyn ; James A. Lundy , Queens , and William C. Thompson , - the Bronx . There is no chairman for Staten Island , where solicitation is carried out by the Community War Chest . Labor Takes Part in Drive Mr. Baker said the two principal branches of organized labor had pledged their support . Vice-chairmen of the campaign include Jacob S. Potofsky , general secretary-treasurer of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers , Congress of Industrial Organizations , and Frederick F. Umhey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union , American Federation of Labor . " Our goal is the same as in 1943 , " Mr. Baker declared , " but we do have to raise more money than we did last year , when we fell $166,020 below our goal . This should not be difficult . Some concerns which have been making more money than they did last year can afford to give a little more . " Others , perhaps , can be persuaded to raise their giving standards to correspond with what is done by others in the same group . " Mrs. E. M. Statler , chairman of the employe solicitation committee of the fund , spoke of the increasing role women are playing in its work , with more than 4,000 serving on the wards of voluntary hospitals , health and welfare agen-1 cies and working in the fund campaign . Mrs. Statler urged a better showing this year than last by employe groups , which contributed more than $800,000 . While " good , " the figure was not impressive measured against the 2,500,000 employed persons in the city , Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outgrowth of a democratic process designed to " give full sway to individual initiative and action . " However , he remarked that voluntary philanthropy had not always kept pace with ' social requirements , as a result of which government now shared a large place in this field . " I earnestly trust the invasion will go no further , " he added , " and that this volunteer service in which we are interested will continue as the citizens ' direct obligation , and will never become a governmental function . The 403 agencies participating in the fund provide service free or below cost to persons . of all races and creeds , without discrimination , who are residents of the five boroughs of New York City . They include seventy-three voluntary hospitals , a number of convalescent homes , visiting nurse services , specialized health agencies , shelters , institutions for the deaf and blind , agencies providing vocational guidance and special care for children , institutions for the aged , and recreation and health groups for children .
