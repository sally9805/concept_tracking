txt Rivers of blood are flowing . Brother fights brother . Crops , houses and forests are burned . Public works are destroyed and civilians killed . I ask you where all this will lead if it continues . Do the Serbian people want civil war ? General Milan Neditch , Serbian leader who was once War Minister of Yugoslavia , spoke thus last week over the Belgrade radio to his defeated countrymen . The general was quoted by a pro-Axis Hungarian source , which implied that he was appealing for order in the land overrun by last April 's Balkan Blitzkrieg . For weeks tales of unrest have filtered through the cordon of censorship around the former kingdom of the South Slays . The spark of revolt has apparently been fanned from underground into open armed conflict between Serbian patriots on the one side and pro-Axis groups , Italian and German occupation forces on the other . The backbone of Serbian resistance are the Chetniks ( from the Serbian " company " ) , the secret band which learned how to carry on a guerrilla fight during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yugoslav soldiers , after the Nazi victory last Spring , fled with their weapons into the Serbian hills to join the Chetniks . Now , it is estimated , 100,000 of the guerrilla warriors harry the Italians and Germans . The Chetniks have fired grain fields , torn up rail lines , dynamited tunnels , warehouses and munition dumps , attacked enemy stragglers , outposts and patrols . Axis reprisal has been severe . Sunset curfews have been imposed , with night loiterers shot on sight . The hangman and the firing squad have taken a toll of thousands . The scene in former Yugoslavia was symptomatic of the unrest that has risen like a fever throughout Nazi- I occupied Europe as the Red Army has fought off the Germans . In occupied France last week anti-terrorist courts , spurred by German pressure , meted out harsh penalties for sabotage and distribution of Communist and Free French propaganda . In Denmark more than 150 " Communists " were arrested . In Belgium women staged food riots . Settlement With Mexico ?

From the Mexican OonatItution of 191T . This constitutional article was cited in 1988 when the government of Mexico took over the entire foreign petroleum industry  --  oil lands , equipment and concessions  --  valued at $450,000,000 by the United States and British companies affected . Those companies had controlled 95 per cent of Mexico 's production of " black gold . " The expropriations led to a rupture of diplomatic connections between Mexico and London . No such serious trouble resulted with Washington , but the State Department insisted that Mexico make compensation to the dispossessed United States nationals . Another point of controversy was land taken from Americans and made into " ejidos " ? comm  --  nal farms  --  by the Mexican Government . Negotiations for indemnity payments dragged on and on . Meanwhile Mexico 's economy began to suffer , British and American companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced the purchase price paid by the Treasury for silver . That meant another blow to Mexico , for silver is the country 's chief export . The European war has forced Mexico to shift trade relations from the old world to the United States , Successful Negotiations Last week Mexico 's President , Manuel Avila Camacho , declared that the indemnity problem and some of his country 's economic difficulties were on the point of solution . In an address at the opening of the Mexican Congress he revealed that negotiations between Mexico and the United States for a comprehensive agreement were in their final stages . Some of the important points being worked out were : ( 1 ) final payment by Mexico for the expropriations ; ( 2 ) purchase of silver by the United States and assistance in helping to stabilize Mexico 's peso ; ( 3 ) ' a general commercial treaty involving a reduction of United States tariffs . In Washington it was learned that the United States was ready to make a large loan to Mexico .

Nazi ' Show Window ' Leipzig , the ancient Slav settlement which became a great German city , has won fame as a book capital , toy manufactory , university town and music center . There Luther disputed , Goethe went to school , Leasing produced his first play , Leibnitz and Wagner were natives , and Bach lies buried . More celebrated In Leipzig 's life than these , perhaps , are her Spring and Autumn Fairs . Their origin goes back more than 700 years . Over the centuries they have served as showplace for German goods and clearing house for products from over the world . Last week the narrow , cobbled streets lined by Leipzig 's steeply roofed buildings were thronged with visitors and buyers come for the Autumn Fair . The event coincided with the war 's second anniversary . In more than two score buildings scattered through the city 615 business firms of nineteen foreign nations displayed their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asserted that the number of exhibits had increased since last year , called the fair the " show window of Europe , " hailed it as a symbol of the new economic order being built on the continent under German hegemony . Neutral observers found the bustle at Leipzig seemingly as of old . Under the surface changes were noted , the strain of war evident . Russia and the United States , as well as Britain , had no representatives , where formerly they held important places . The only non-European countries on hand were Chile , Brazil , Turkey and Japan . " Ersatz " ? arising from material shortages ? was prominent on most counters ; Danish silversmiths , for example , had to display their goods in stainless steel rather than silver . Once a Leipzig Fair sold more than $200,000,000 worth of goods ( including $70,000,000 for export ) ; at this season 's show , buyers found it impossible to place orders with any certainty of delivery .                  @ @ @
