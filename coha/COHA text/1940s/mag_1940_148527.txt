For the first time since November 1938 , the biggest 26 U. S. life insurance companies-holders of 87% of the assets of all life companies-were free last week from the job of waiting on and helping SEC in its vast insurance study for the Temporary National Economic ( monopoly ) Committee . As far as TNEC was concerned the study had been completed . But for the big 26 there was still a question to decide . TNEC had offered to let them present further testimony on the probity of U. S. life insurance . Should they do so ? Through last week officers of the big 26 went into huddle after huddle , at week 's end were still undecided what to do . <P> The monumental study of the big 26 prepared by SEC Economist Ernest J. Howe had showed that the big 26 own 11.6% of the Federal debt , hold better than a tenth of the mortgage on U. S. private industry , 17.4% of the mortgage on U. S. railroads ( TIME , Feb. 26 ) . It also showed that they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group , grounded the fair conclusion that policyholders had suffered less in depression than bank depositors , brokers ' customers , stockholders of investment trusts . Toward the close of the hearing last fortnight , SEC 's grey-haired young inquisitor , Gerhard Gesell , showed however , that the record of insurance companies beyond the control of such strict States as New York and Massachusetts had been something less than perfect . <P> Between 1929 and 1938 , 19 smaller insurance companies , most of them under the control of Middle Western States , went to the wall and initial indicated losses to policyholders totaled $130,000,000 . Famed Insurance Statistician Alfred <P> M. Best , devout defender of the well-run insurance companies , attributed most of the crashes to bad investment judgment , rather than skulduggery . But he was able to point a striking contrast : during the period when 19 small insurance companies were failing , 14,000 banks great and small also crashed and indicated initial loss to their depositors was $3,500,000,000 . <P> As impressed as anyone by this comparative record was SEC 's Leon Henderson whom Business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was more astounded than insurancemen when Commissioner Henderson broke in on Statistician Best 's testimony to point and dramatize the Best statistics . <P> " I think that is an extraordinary record as far as the integrity of insurance assets are concerned , " said he . " . . . It is an amazing record as far as investment policy is concerned . " Pleased but not disarmed as the hearing ended , U. S. insurance still had reason to fear that the TNEC study may still be the basis for a bill to put the business under Federal control , not at this session of Congress when the SEC has its hands full with its investment trust bill , but perhaps in 1941.
