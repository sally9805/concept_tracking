txt Marshal Henri-Philippe Pdtain was convicted at 4:15 A. M. today of intelligence with the enemy and sentenced to death . Because of his age  --  the former head of the Vichy regime is 89  --  the jury expressed the hope that the death sentence might not be carried out . Guards had to arouse Petain in his cell to bring him into the courtroom to hear the verdict . He seemed as impassive as ever during the reading of the judgment , which lasted twenty minutes . Only when the presiding judge , Pierre Mongibeaux , ordered : " Guards , remove the accused , " did Petain seem to realize that this was his own trial . He continued to sit until a guard tapped his shoulder . Then , dazed , he rose , turned one way and another and seemed about to fall .. His eyes turned toward his lawyers , who pointed silently to the door . Petain took his gold-braided cap and his gloves and followed the guards , apparently still not understanding . The judgment ordered the confiscation of all Petain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The High Court of Justice took more than seven hours to reach its verdict . It had to vote on retaining or discarding each count in the indictment . The judgment was a long document , full of " whereases . " From the tenor of the first few sentences it became evident to all except Petain that the verdict would be " guilty . " Petain , who had Sat forward in his chair . soon leaned back in an attitude familiar during the twenty-day trial . He was paler than usual and one hand nervously stroked his mustache . The judgment upheld every count in the indictment , even some that the prosecutor , Andre Mornet , had intimated he would net press . The court found Main guilty of a plot against the French Republic , conceived many years prior to the war , asking for an armistice in June , 1940 , to further his plans ; broadcasting his intentions three days in advance , thereby demoralizing the army and increasing the number made prisoner ; suppressing Republican institutions ; aiding enemy troops in Syria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France by patriots and/or organizing the French Militia , which killed and tortured thousands . /Detain was further found guilty of having led astray many good citizens who had faith in him because of his past record . The judgment attributed to him responsibility for all the acts carried out in his name . Finally , the court found him guilty of premeditation . There were no demonstrations in the court , although the public galleries were filled by people who had patiently waited seven hours . The jury went out at 9 o'clock last night after having heard the defense argue that Petain had tried to serve France in his way as Gen. Charles . de Gaulle had tried in his . The defense warned against a verdict that , it said , would divide the nation when unity was needed . After his attorneys had finished , Petain was asked whether he had anything to add . " Yes , " he said , taking out a paper from which he read : " During this trial I deliberately kept silent after having explained the reason to the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people on French soil in accordance with my promise to try to protect them and lighten their sufferings . Whatever happened , the people will not forget . They know that I defended them as I defended Verdun .

Do with me as your consciences dictate . i have nothing on my conscience , for , during an already long life and on the threshhold of death . I affirm that I have had no other ambition than to serve France . " As he finished there was some clapping in the galleries . There had also been applause when his chief attorney , Fernand Payen , shouted : " Long live France ! " at the close of his speech , in which he appealed for the union of all Frenchmen in order that France might live . " Each in his way and according to his temperament , de Gaulle and Petain , has served ' France , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resistance , Petain the negative pole ' for both were essential . " Says Main Would Be Martyr No applause followed the plea of Jacques Isorni , M. Payen 's colleague , but it left the court hushed . " Should you decide for death , you must not cower behind the clemency of another man , " he said , alluding to General de Gaulle 's power of commutation . " You will see how a marshal of France can die , for you will all be present in spirit when this illustrious old man stands at the stake of martyrdom . Memories of his pale face will haunt you while the people of France will beat their breasts . " Petain 's attorneys had been so exhaustive in their speeches reviewing the evidence that it was 9 P. M. before the court retired to discuss the verdict . Under the procedure of the High Court of Justice , the three judges and the twenty-four jurors took part in the discussions , all passing on the sentence as well as the verdict . M.

Payen alluded to the death sentence imposed on General de Gaulle by Vichy and he read the following memorandum in Pdtain 's writing , found among his papers : " The judgment against de Gaulle was intended to maintain discipline in the Army and to prevent officers from going over to the Free French .
