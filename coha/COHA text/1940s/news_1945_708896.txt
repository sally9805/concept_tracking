" FORRESTAL GIVES WARNING Says ' We Must Not Go Back to Blind Trust in Unpreparedness ' WASHINGTON , Sept. 2 ( // ) ? James V. Forrestal , Secretary of the Navy , warned today that " we must not go back to the blind trust in unpreparedness that prevailed before the war . " To do so , he commented during a Columbia Broadcasting System broadcast , would be to " choose again to fly into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to God that we have learned the lesson  --  the lesson that peace without power is an empty dream , that it is an invitation for evil men to shake the very foundations of society . Now more than ever before we must make it our business to see that the means to wage war be kept ( in the hands of those who hate war . " The end of the war against Japan , he said , finds the sea-air power of the American Navy " in a position such as it has never held before . " He added : " The Navy , which against great odds drove victoriously across the Pacific , now becomes one of the foundation stones for the hope of peace and order in the world . " Mr. Forrestal prefaced his remarks about preparedness with a tribute to the Navy 's fighting men . He said : " The elation of victory is in every mind and heart , but it is an elation which for me , as I know it is for you , is tempered by solemn recollection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living reminders of our wounded still in hospitals . To those men , living and dead , we pay reverent homage today and in our prayers of thanksgiving to God we add the prayer that we may never forget what they have done for their country .
