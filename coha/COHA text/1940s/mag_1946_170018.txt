At his ornately carved dark wood desk in Lima 's graceful Presidential Palace , President Jos Luis Bustamante pored over a plan . It had been drawn up , at his request , by crack U.S. petroleum engineer Arthur Curtice . The plan was to throw Peru 's important oil reserves open to foreign exploitation . <P> In the musty chambers of Lima 's venerable Gran Hotel Bolvar , over bourbon-and-sodas , representatives of the world 's major oil companies also studied the supposedly secret Curtice plan . They grumbled at proposed royalties that would resemble the prevailing Venezuelan scale of 16 ? % . Such percentages , they said , were fair enough in proven fields like Venezuela , but high for Peru , where exploration costs are probably the highest in the world and where the trans-Andean pipeline to bring oil out to the west coast might cost $30,000,000 . <P> Peruvians believed they had gone more than halfway by cutting combined royalties and export tax from their present high of 37% . And three factors might well influence oilmen to agree : <P> 1 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Californian oil may be running out ; <P> 3 ) Peru 's Amazonian fields may be even richer than million-barrel-a-day Venezuela . <P> First to Flow . Without doubt , black gold abounded in the Montana-as Peruvians call their Amazonian foothills east of the Andes . A jungle-whacking , California-financed wildcatter-the Ganso Azul ( Blue Goose ) Petroleum Co. - had long since proved that . Last week , Ganso Azul was hard at work , as it had been for seven years , not exploring but producing , cracking petroleum and selling gasoline , kerosene and diesel oil . <P> Ganso Azul had become a legend since the day in 1929 that a U.S. geologist , studying the trackless Montana for a possible railroad , spotted from the air what has since been described as the nearest thing to a perfect geological oil dome . A 2,800-mile supply line up the Amazon , oil diplomacy , and proliferating jungle postponed the payoff till 1939 . Then Ganso Azul drilled a well that was a honey : 750 barrels a day . Thenceforth , the problem was not producing but selling oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Amazon from Iquitos in his double-decked river boat Lucrecia last week was Ganso Azul manager Edgar Clayton . As usual , he was looking for new business . He tied the Lucre da up to mudbanks by thatch-roofed Campa Indian villages , talked with mestizo river merchants about setting up new distribution centers . <P> With the river valley his only market , Clayton first floated oil drums downstream to Iquitos as rafts tied together with vines and buoyed by balsa logs . Later he got barges , now has river tankers . During the war he sold gasoline , kerosene and fuel oil as far down the river as Manaus . <P> Already Ganso Azul has brought new life into the Peruvian Montana . Indians who never saw a lamp come with bottles and even hollow canes for kerosene . With wicks stuffed into tin cans , they now have lights in their huts . A balanced diet of vegetables , fruit , beef , pork and chicken for the company 's 250 employes has by example encouraged better living habits among other Indians .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
