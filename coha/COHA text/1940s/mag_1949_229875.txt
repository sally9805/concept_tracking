DRY MESSIAH ( 353 pp. ) - Virginius Dabney-Knopf ( $4 ) . <P> <P> Like most Methodist ministers at the turn of the century , Virginia 's young ( 36 ) James Cannon Jr . was dedicated to the defeat of the Demon Rum . Gaunt and black-bearded , humorless and generally disliked , he licked alcohol by legislation in his native state ( 1914 ) , did as much as any man to bring prohibition to the U.S. Like many of his contemporaries who believed that morality could be legislated , he periodically struck out at lesser demons . Dancing , tobacco , Coca-Cola and even football ( " neither manly nor Christian " ) felt his indignant lash . But in 1930 , this paragon of virtue , by then long a bishop and according to H. L. Mencken " the most powerful ecclesiastic ever heard of in America , " was accused by the elders of his own church of immorality , bucketshop gambling , flour-hoarding ( during World War I ) , adultery , lying and " gross moral turpitude and disregard for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Walkouts . Dry Messiah is Richmond Newspaper Editor Virginius Dabney 's careful and stolid look at a puritan 's progress from circuit-riding man-of-God to arrogant director of a nation 's morals . It does little to explain the man or the moral climate in which he was bred , but it is a useful and embarrassing reminder that for over a decade Cannon 's narrow vision and flinty prohibitionist zeal were among the most persuasive forces in U.S. politics . <P> The secret of Cannon 's success was the unsparing use of his apparently boundless nervous energy . At one time , besides his duties as head of a Methodist girls ' school , he edited a newspaper , ran the Anti-Saloon League , speculated heavily on Wall Street and was one of the most active lobbyists for legal morality in Washington . His handling of political contributions became a national scandal , but he successfully defied congressional committees that sought to bring him to heel . Once he walked out of a public hearing after refusing to testify . Brought before both civil and ecclesiastical courts he always got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgiveness saved him from the wrath of fellow churchmen . <P> I 'll See You in Court . On the evidence given in Dry Messiah alone , most readers will probably conclude that he was guilty as charged by church and state . But thousands of prohibitionists were ready to accept the denials of the man who had done so much to whip the saloon . Cannon 's favorite tactic was to sue his detractors for huge amounts in libel suits that he tried to settle for small amounts out of court . In his day he sued a Congressman for $500,000 and William Randolph Hearst for a total of $7,500,000 . He lost the one , settled the Hearst suits out of court , also lost his suits against TIME , which had called him " reactionary , " and LIFE , which had said he was " bigoted . "
