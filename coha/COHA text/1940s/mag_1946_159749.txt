Like a black sheep son , the tangle of surplus property was back on the front pages again last week . The anti-administration New York Sun was telling horrendous and undocumented tales of graft and inefficiency ( sample : an unnamed War Assets Administration salesman sold $120 worth of property , collected $15,000 for expenses ) . In Washington , five Congressional committees were trying to find out what was wrong . <P> One man who thought he knew what was wrong was Louis Broido , executive vice president of Manhattan 's Gimbel Bros. , which has sold more surplus property than any other U.S. retailer . On the basis of this , Broido told the Senate 's Mead Committee : all consumer-type surpluses should be sold through big city department stores . Under his plan , surpluses would be sold in the stores , the cash going to WAA . To do the job right , the cumbersome system of priorities for veterans , local governments , educational institutions should be scrapped . <P> Unwieldy Law . But , as Broido knew , the priority system was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congressmen , would probably stay there . Said Broido of the hodgepodge act : " You could be the smartest merchant in the world , Old Man Original Macy or Gimbel himself , and you could n't do a very good job . . . with this legislation . " <P> Lieut . General E. B. Gregory , WAA administrator who had done a conscientious job administering a bad law , agreed with Broido . Priorities had held up the disposal of some surpluses as long as six months . General Gregory also liked Broido 's plan for department store sales . But he did not know whether WAA had the right to use that system . <P> Unwieldy Inventories . And there were other troubles . Getting the services to declare items surplus was still a problem . Example : the Army had 25,000 almost-new passenger cars rusting and rotting in an Atlanta depot . When this hoard was publicized , the Army reluctantly gave up only 7,000 of them , and they were the worst of the lot . <P> WAA was also wrestling with the artificial division of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be classified differently , warehoused thousands of miles apart , described in Army or Navy nomenclature no civilian buyer could understand . <P> But the basic trouble was political . With every politico wanting some surplus articles , or thinking he wanted them , for schools and cities back home , no one was getting much of anything . Out of the $15 billions in declared surpluses , only $2.3 billion had been sold , and the Government got only $942 million in cash . And the investigations going on seemed to do more harm than good . Said General Gregory : " All this pressure from Congress and its various committees had made WAA a little timid about doing anything drastic . "
