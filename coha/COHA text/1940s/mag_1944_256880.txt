Argentina 's predominantly democratic people may have found a leader . At least , they have found one man who dared defy the blustering military Government . He was Jos Aguirre Cmara , former deputy in Congress . <P> Last March , Police Chief Colonel Filomeno Velazco suspected Aguirre Cmara of being editor of the famous underground newspaper Himno National ( National Anthem ) . Arrested and imprisoned , Aguirre Cmara won his liberty by promising not to attack the Government without telling the police beforehand . Last month , astonished Police Chief Velazco got Aguirre Cmara 's warning . Soon , wrote the cheeky ex-deputy , he would publish a scathing pamphlet . He would print it in Argentina . He would remain in the country " until I am convinced that the people do not want to be saved . " <P> Velazco mobilized the entire police force , hunted high &; low . He did not find Aguirre Cmara or his printing plant . On schedule , the pamphlet appeared . Entitled Demagogia , Inflacin y Armamentismo ( Demagoguery , Inflation and Militarism ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Government agencies . Before the police woke up to the trick , it had reached a wide audience . A single copy now brings as much as 1,000 pesos ( $250 ) . <P> Cheap Demagoguery . Aguirre Cmara pulled no punches . Damning the Government as totalitarian , he predicted that it would lead Argentina into inflation and militarism . Blasting powerful Vice President Juan Domingo Pern , he deflated his " love of the workingman " as demagoguery . <P> Aguirre Cmara comes of an old family in Crdoba Province . In both political and private life his record is so blameless that even the slugging nationalist press of Buenos Aires has not been able to smear him . His aged patrician mother still chooses his clothes . When he was Finance Minister of Crdoba , he gave her his paycheck every week , like a boy on his first job . <P> Many Argentines are inclined to be contemptuous of the oppositionists who thunder at the Government from safety across the river in Montevideo . They admire Aguirre Cmara for remaining in Argentina . Last week the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother , she drew herself up proudly . " Go ahead and look for him , " she said . " You wo n't find him . I 've put him in the hands of God , who knows he is fighting for the salvation of his country . "
