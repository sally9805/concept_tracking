The war at sea , which for seven months eclipsed the war on land , was obscured but by no means suspended by last week 's maelstrom in Belgium and France ( see p. 23 ) . Two major moves were made almost in lock step : <P> 1 ) The German Navy set up northern headquarters in Oslo and Grand Admiral Erich Raeder there visited Admiral Hermann Boehm , commander of the Nazis Norse naval district . <P> 2 ) Great Britain discontinued its contraband control bases at Weymouth in the south and The Downs on the southeast English coast , removed all but a skeleton staff from the control base at Kirkwall in the Orkneys . <P> Admiral Raeder was putting pressure on Germany 's fitting up of Oslo Fjord , Bergen and Trondheim as submarine bases , and on the laying down of new tonnage-merchant as well as naval- in Norse and Danish shipyards . <P> Great Britain withdrew her controls from Weymouth and The Downs partly because of Germany 's new proximity in The Netherlands , but chiefly because , when the war reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany became practically 100% . The skeleton crew at Kirkwall will look over only the few ships bound for Sweden , Finland , Russia and her Baltic satellites . <P> All Dutch and Belgian ships not caught at home by the Germans were available for the Allies ' merchant fleet . These additions , together with tonnage contributed gladly by Norway , less gladly by the fretful , fearful Danes , added about one-third to the Allies ' merchant marine and put them so far ahead of present requirements that they could last week reduce charter rates by 20-25%.
