A marshal , sergeant-major , commissary of musters , lieutenant-colonel to the general , provost marshal and paymaster were chosen from the lead-ing captains . A list of fifty-six captains , for the most part taken from those that had seen service in the Netherlands or in the recent campaign in Portugal , was submitted by Willoughby , and selections made from them by the queen and council . The general was authorized to take into the service twelve drummers , six fifers and six surgeons for each of the four regiments . The archbishop of Canterbury and the bishops of London , Winchester and Chichester were ordered each to appoint a chaplain for one of the regiments for a month , to be paid twenty shillings a day by a levy on the clergy of the diocese . The archbishop was also asked to have one of his chaplains draw up and put in print a special form of daily prayers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military discipline of the forces was also issued . Although Willoughby , according to custom , was given by his commission the right to confer knighthood on any of his officers , he was instructed not to make use of this right except for very unusual occasions and in cases where the recipient of the honor had inherited means to maintain the place . ' There was the usual delay in the departure of the expedi-tion . The loth of September was first chosen for the day of embarkation , then the date was postponed till the 24th , and still again postponed . On the 22nd and 24th two stragglers from the fleet were set upon by a League officer with some boats from St. Valery and Dunkirk , and their capture gave occasion for much rejoicing and the printing of a couple of pamphlets at Paris . On the 26th came over to Lord Wil-loughby , who was by this time at the seaside , a hasty mes-sage from Sir Edward Stafford , the English ambassador in France , saying that the duke of Mayenne with the army of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had with-drawn and that it might not be necessary after all for the English troops to be taken across the channel . Stafford had secured from Henry himself a reluctant assent to the sending of this message . Willoughby , however , who had almost his whole body of troops on their transports , rejected the advice of the ambassador , went aboard ship the same day , and with such troops as were ready reached Dieppe on the morning of the 28th of September , much to Henry 's delight . The general was promptly rebuked by the queen and privy council for his precipitancy , such troops as were not yet embarked were held back , and instructions given to keep those already sent over ready to be brought back on immediate notice . Nevertheless when Willoughby wrote offering to return , he was ordered to await further instruc-tions where he was . Finally the remaining troops were released , all reached Normandy by October 1st and matters were allowed to take their course . ' The English general had small reason to be proud of his troops . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill-chosen and badly armed , " as he reported , and he advised that the local authorities who had levied and equipped them be called before the council , " least ye conse , consequences be perillous . " Those from Kent and London were better , and with the latter came a liberal provision of artillery and ammunition that was most welcome . As usual , a group of gentlemen , amounting in this case to about fifty , came along with the regular force as volunteers , serving at their own expense and largely at their own will . The condition of the troops improved under daily drill , and by the ninth of October when the English troops were all brought out on a Sunday afternoon on a hill near Dieppe to be viewed by the king he professed himself greatly delighted by their appear222 A HISTORY OF ENGLAND ance . By means of the money that had come from England , Henry was able to retain in his service for a longer period the Swiss troops that had been in the employ of the late king , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercenary German reiters , or cavalry , for whose services he had long been negotiating . On the day before the arrival of Wil-loughby some 1500 Scots also joined the king 's forces , and soon afterward he received the adherence of several more French nobles with their followers . From the very beginning of the war Henry 's boldness verged so close on rashness as to drive his followers almost to despair . Willoughby records , soon after his arrival , the departure of the king by night with 1200 horse on some enterprise unknown , and that " everybody heere is madd at ytt , and above others , the Marshall Biron , to see him take those nyghte enterprises in hand himself . " 1 With this somewhat heterogeneous force , Henry began in October a three months ' campaign which , although made up of small successes , did much to put his fortunes in the ascend-ant and to build a solid foundation for his ultimate although long delayed victory . A beautifully written journal , drawn up by Willoughby 's orders , still preserves a continuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected.2 The first movement was directly on Paris . Marshal Biron asked especially to lead the English regiments , and with them and some French and Swiss occupied the faubourgs of Vichy and St. Marceau . Paris was soon closely invested and a number of the surrounding towns captured . But it was probably no part of Henry 's policy to subject his capital either to a long siege or a sack . Moreover the duke of Mayenne succeeded in introducing reinforcements . So two weeks after the landing of Willoughby and his men , // with Henry 's whole army they were again on the march . It did not suit the king 's plans to conform to the queen 's wishes that he should follow the coast . Instead he began a series of short sieges and quick captures of towns in Normandy , Touraine and Maine . Making a long circuit to the southwestward , then to the northwestward , Henry captured successively Corbeil , Etampes , Joinville , Chateaudun , Vendome , Alencon , Mantes , and some ten or twelve other places . The part taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpromising personnel , poor equipment and insufficient support , was by no means insignificant . The officers and even the men seem to have possessed a dash , an adaptability and a determination that called forth the admiration of the French soldiers , the thanks of Henry and even words of appreciation from the queen . Elizabeth in one of her only too infrequent gracious moods added with her own hand the following postscript to an official letter to Willoughby , " My good Peregrine , I bless God that your old prosperous successe followithe your valiant acts , and joye not a little that safety accompanythe your Lucke . Your loving Soverain , El . R. " One of the English officers writes that the natives " account us to be a company of Huguenots , a terrible and resolute people , wading through whatever we take in hand . " At the siege of Alencon , a Captain Lea constructed an " engine , " consisting of some kind of a hook , by which a drawbridge was drawn down in the very sight of the garrison so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across it into a ravelin , put to the sword all its defenders and guaranteed the success of the whole attack . At the siege of Mantes where the English regiments were appointed to seize the suburbs on the far side of the river , Willoughby , after fulfilling this duty , built a floating bridge of empty hogsheads and ladders and captured a number of mills on the river which gave him access directly to the town wall . La Noue writes to Walsingham reporting that the king and all the French were much pleased with the actions of the English , that Williams and other English // gentlemen have " borne themselves with honor , " and that Sherley is a " gentil cavallero . " But there is another side to the story that becomes more and more insistent as time goes on . This is the increasing suf-fering from hunger , disease and exposure of the little Eng-lish army . Notwithstanding its effective service its condition became more and more deplorable through the whole cam-paign . After its departure from Dieppe , for more than two months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partial payment to the soldiers of their first month 's wages . The soldiers ' clothes and shoes soon wore out , their weapons were injured or lost in battle or by carelessness , they had no money by which food might be purchased , and they were reduced to the necessity , as was the rest of the army , of pillag-ing for their daily needs . The old national hatred of French for English was re-awakened among the peasantry , making their foraging all the more difficult , and many stragglers from the main body had their throats cut . Willoughby writes home that " to fill their hungry belly they are faine , after the licentious fashion of warres , to spoyle ; which the frenche indure worst of all of our nation , because we are English . . . . Our misery through the contagion is worse than ever . " John Stubbs , whose right hand had been sacrificed to his Puritan outspokenness , but whose left hand had still swung his hat while he shouted " God save the queen , " ten years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gives a vivid account of its sufferings and irregularities . But he testifies that " our nation is not infamed of murder or ravishment , " " our chief gentlemen do carry away an honor-able name of courtesie , " and closes his account by saying , " I still think it an honor to have been on this jornie. " 2 The marches were often long for foot troops , and they suffered from exhaustion as well as hunger and exposure . // The English with their habits of heavier feeding suffered worse than the more frugal French and Swiss . Meat they must have , if in any way possible , even if there was no salt for it and but little opportunity for cooking it . Henry wrote to his ambassador in England that he often saw the English soldiers eating half-raw the pork and goat 's flesh they had secured . Lord Willoughby and the other officers did their best to relieve the distress . The general 's private wagon and the officers ' horses were regularly utilized to carry sick and wounded soldiers . Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he and they were all penniless together . Good humor and good fellowship he did provide . Once when the English footmen had to cross a stream , the French horsemen , including the king himself , took them up behind on their horses and carried them over . He knew all the English officers personally and gave hearty recognition to whatever they did . He was present in every melee , in the midst of the soldiery and often indistinguishable from them . ' Word from home was seldom a source of encouragement to the English army , although once or twice the queen sent congratulations and messages of acknowledgment of some-thing accomplished . But usually the letters were devoted to warning the troops to be careful of their accoutrements so that they might be returned uninjured to the county storehouses , to complaints of Henry 's failure to fulfil his engagements , and to somewhat conflicting instructions as to the ultimate return of the expedition . The early return of the troops to England had never ceased to be a matter of almost daily anticipation , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week and month after month . Wil-loughby himself , when the French army marched southward from Paris beyond the boundaries of Normandy , fearing that his troops would be carried to the distant interior of France , asked the king for leave to return to Dieppe and to send to // England for shipping to carry his men home . Henry , on the other hand , had his political objects in going at least as far as Tours , quite apart from the military exigencies of his position . There was established all that existed of his civil government , including the loyal members of the parlement of Paris and of the council of state . He therefore urged Willoughby to go thither with him , promising then to turn northward toward Caen . On the twelfth of November , 1589 , Henry met his council at Tours and at the same time held a royal sitting of the parlement and gave public audience to foreign ambassadors , thus asserting a kingship in form as well as fact for which the military struggle ordinarily gave but scant opportunity . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ambassador of Venice , who appeared at Tours with a message of congratulation from the seignory . These ceremonies over Henry resumed his military activ-ity and in accordance with his promise to the English directed his march again toward Normandy . Willoughby now re-peatedly brought up the question of the departure of the troops . As the weather became more rigorous and the shoes and clothing of the English soldiers wore out still more com-pletely their sufferings increased . Many of the best men in the English forces begged that they should either be sent home at once or put into garrison by the king to recuperate . As Willoughby said , they could now fight only against the weather and their necessities . They had already been reduced to one half their original numbers and as they marched northward there were numerous desertions . The month for which the queen had agreed to pay the troops had long since expired , they had no regular payments from the king , and were now not only without support , but had only the most vague general promises of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They became continually more restive . ' // In November a new special ambassador , Philippe de Fresne , was sent to England , and on the fourth of December he with Beauvoir , who had now become permanent ambassador in place of Buzenval , laid before the queen an offer of the king to pay the English troops for the second month of their service , already expired , out of the new loan , recently obtained from England , and then either to take them directly into his pay or dismiss them , according to their own request . To this Elizabeth agreed . Willoughby was ordered to ex-plain the circumstances to the dissatisfied officers and sol-diers and to persuade them to continue in their duty and service to the queen and the common cause . Some clothing was also sent over by the government to be sold to the soldiers at a set price , and arrangements entered into by which private merchants could take over as much more to be sold at such profit as they could make . But the supply of clothes was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the troops were no longer necessary to the king . The campaign was practically over . Henry 's victorious journey through Normandy , Maine and Touraine had been com-pleted and he was already contemplating the temporary dissolution of such troops as he had in the field . While agreeing therefore to pay the troops for their second month of service , he announced his willingness to dispense with the main part of the English force . He asked at first that he be allowed to retain with him eight hundred or one thousand picked troops under Sir John Borough as colonel . Willoughby warned the home government that apart from the sick and wounded there were now probably not more than this number in his whole force . Finally , the day after Christmas , Henry withdrew his request for the retention of even this portion of the troops and licensed all to depart . ' On the 28th of December , 1589 , exactly three months from the day of their departure from Dieppe to Paris , the troops arrived again at the coast at Dives , not far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition of the soldiery was such that Willoughby did not await regular transports from England . He wrote to Burghley , " I am afeared if the ship-ping come not the sooner I shall leave few behind and bring home fewer . In my life nothing ever grieved me more , but I must endure God 's will . " Beginning with the last day of the year he sent the sick and wounded and many others home in such vessels as could be engaged for the purpose at Dives . The privy council expressed their disapproval of this irregularity , and made all requirements still possible for giving the soldiers passports , for ascertaining the time for which they had been already paid and arranging for the return of their weapons . Within the early part of January the few survivors were brought back into England . Lord Willoughby himself lingered in France a little longer and was with the king at the capture of Honfleur on January 15 , 1590 . On his departure , Henry , who seems to have gained a sincere regard for him , gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family . Henry had already written to the queen acknowledging the help the English troops had been to him , praising the courage and good judgment of Wil-loughby and complimenting her on her choice of officers for her troops.l On the 21st. of January , 1590 , Willoughby made his personal report to the queen at Lambeth . On the 4th of February , ? 4630 , the wages of the troops for their second month , which had been paid over by the French ambassador , was placed in his hands to be paid to the troops . The arrangement made by the privy council was that the captains should be paid as if their companies were complete . The captains in turn should pay to the survivors of their companies the wages due them ; out of the remainder they should pay the costs of transportation of the troops from France to England , and // keep what there was left . This double position of the cap-tains as military and financial officials , as contractors for their companies as well as their leaders , was demoralizing in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the common soldiers . No provision was made for the payment to the families of those who had died of wages due , and no payment was made beyond the two months provided for , although the period of service had extended over more than three months . Thus ended the first expedition sent by Elizabeth to the aid of Henry . It was in many ways typical of those which were to follow . Of the four thousand men who had been sent , it is hardly probable that a thousand returned . Two years afterward the council in referring to this expedition declared that " Her Majesty is informed , and we do feare the same to be true , that few of the men returned againe. " 1 They had taken part in no pitched battles , but were worn away by casual losses in a long series of sieges and attacks upon fortified towns , by hunger , disease , exposure and other privations . The most valuable aid they gave to Henry was the moral effect of the English alliance in this early and criti-cal period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ League supported by its great Spanish patron was so over-whelming that it is difficult to see how Henry could have gained any foothold or built up any party in his kingdom had his cause not been upheld and opportune assistance given by some other power , and this support England alone could and did give . CHAPTER XII VERE IN THE NETHERLANDS AND NORRIS IN BRITTANY , zggo-gr Jr PART from Henry 's great victory of Ivry in March and some operations in the Netherlands , the greater part of the year 1590 passed away with less fighting than those which immediately preceded or immediately followed it . It was none the less for the warring states of central Europe one of the most important years in the whole period of conflict . Its earlier months were a pause in the struggle ; before its close the contest began again with new elements and new intensity . It was in the first place marked by sugges-tions of a general peace . The obscure records , memorials and correspondence concerning such a possibility include a recommendation from the emperor to the Netherlands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desirability of peace between England and Spain , an offer from the duke of Florence to the queen to mediate between her and Spain , and the rough outline of a plan of a confederacy so widespread as to guarantee peace , sketched out in the handwriting of Burghley . ' In the conditions then existing , however , uni-versal peace was rather an amiable hope than a possibility . Henry , as a substitute , would gladly have formed all the Protestant states into a league against Spain . This had been , as already stated , one of the propositions of his ambas-sadors to Elizabeth immediately after his accession . The new ambassadors , who had arrived late in , 1589 , M. Sancy and M. de Fresne , had special instructions to bring the pro-posal up again along with their request for further loans , and with M. Beauvoir they laid the matter before the English THE NETHERLANDS AND BRITTANY 23 r ministers with considerable formality and detail . The prop-osition was that an offensive and defensive alliance bind-ing on all princes who should join it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and peaceful communication among its members and protection against their enemies and rebellious subjects . Any member of the league attacked by an enemy or by rebels should have the right to call on the other members to furnish certain stipulated numbers of troops at the expense of the country called upon . If the prince attacked should ask for more than this number of troops they must be furnished to him , if the numbers were reasonable , but at his own expense . Such aid should be continued till the end of the war , however long it should last . Thus a group of states would exist all whose resources would be at the service of each in time of need . Henry offered especially favorable terms to Elizabeth , since " in case of necessity it would be reasonable that the queen should have a larger number than a lesser prince . " 1 The ambassadors who had this project in charge were on their way to Scotland and Germany , in search of mercenary troops and approval of the scheme of the confederation . Elizabeth agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had frequently employed in half diplo-matic , half financial missions , and to provide him with ten thousand pounds with which to hire soldiers for Henry . But the plan of a widespreading anti-Spanish and anti-Catholic league , so alluring to the temperament of Henry , did not interest the queen , who was never attracted to broad plans and lived in a world of details . Moreover as it was quite obvious that Henry was not in a position to defend anybody , even himself , a league in which all the other mem-bers were bound to provide at their own expense protection for the one attacked may well have seemed to her somewhat one sided . No action was therefore taken on the wider plans . They were not , however , forgotten . A copy of the // proposed terms dated a year later than this , August , 1591 , still exists among the state papers ; and Henry complained long afterward of the queen 's neglect of his propositions . I-Iowever disinclined to general agreements , in individual cases Elizabeth was willing to exert her influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she gave both diplomatic and financial help in the formation of the treaties with the Protestant German princes , so she aided Henry by personal letters and the advice of her agent in his negotiations at this time for a treaty with the sultan of Turkey . There was also some discussion of a joint expedition of England , France and the Netherlands for the restoration of Don Antonio , but nothing came of it . ' Intervention in 1590 was in the air . In January the bonds were drawn more closely between the League and Spain by a new treaty ; the Spanish king was given the title Protector of the Crown of France , and agreed to send some 16,000 foot and 3500 horse into France , to loan the Leaguers 500,000 crowns immediately and 20,000 a month while the war lasted . In return for this he was to have possession of certain towns in France , the free use of the Channel harbors , and assistance from the seaboard cities in the equipment and protection of any ships or fleets he might send against England or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand were to be excluded from all French harbors under the control of the League . On the 8th of March Philip followed this up by a declaration addressed to all Christian princes , defending his action in invading France in support of the League , and shortly afterward ordered troops to march into France from the Netherlands . These were the forces which had been the subject of negotiation between the duke of Mayenne and Parma some months before and against the despatch of which Parma had so vigorously protested . ? Fifteen hundred cavalry under Egmont joined Mayenne just in time to be cut to pieces on the field of Ivry . This was , however , but the beginning of the policy of using the veteran troops of Spain // and the military abilities of Parma in support of the League in the civil war in France . When Henry in May again laid siege to Paris , Philip ordered Parma to organize an invading army and himself advance to its relief . The prince , notwithstanding his disapproval of the policy , carried it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrances to the city and forced the king in September to give up the siege and soon afterward to break up the greater part of his army for the winter . The absence of some of the Spanish troops from the Netherlands , then that of Parma himself , following upon his illhealth and discouragement , gave to the Dutch and their English allies in that country an opportunity to carry on a more active policy , the beginnings of which are to be found in the year 1589 . This bolder strategy , however , was as much the result of the personality of their military leaders as it was of their opportunities . The Netherlands estates under the influence of the genius , training and initiative of the young Count Maurice of Nassau , son of William the Silent , showed themselves more ready to organize extended military operations than they had recently been and the whole war gradually took on a somewhat more aggressive character . In these operations the English troops took an important , on many occasions a leading part . They were now under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Willoughby returned to England in March , 1589 , he left the troops in the field in the charge of his young cousin Sir Francis Vere , who had been appointed by him sergeant-major in the field in the preceding January . Vere was twenty-nine years old . He was nephew of the earl of Oxford and the eldest of three brothers who , like the Sidneys and Norrises , were all soldiers . He had come to the Netherlands with Leicester as a volunteer in 1585 , became a captain in 1586 , and had seen service in almost every engagement of importance since , winning especial notice at Sluys and in the fighting before Berghen-op-Zoom . He spent a month in England on leave of absence in 1588 and was at that time presented to the queen . // A new period of the wars in the Netherlands may be considered to have begun on the and of August , 1589 , when the queen issued orders appointing young Vere commander of all the English forces in the field in the Netherlands and directed the governors of Ostende @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their troops as could be spared under his charge , to be sent where the estates should request them . The particular occasion for this action was a report that the Spaniards were about to invade the Bommelwart , a broad region strategically important lying on the south border of the revolted provinces . This attack was warded off , but the ready despatch of troops to the open field was indicative of the direction of later English activities in the Netherlands . It is true that the position of Vere was coordinate with that of the governors of the garrison towns , not that of a supreme commander . In fact in the orders of August , 1589 , the governors of the towns were instructed to choose for the field only such captains and men as were already well disposed to Sir Francis Vere . But more and more it became customary to send men out of the garrison towns to service with this more active force . The good terms on which Vere stood with the other English commanders , his growing military reputation , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governors and captains ready to answer his appeals and the summons of the estates to join in such expeditions . In fact Sidney , Norris and Morgan frequently left their charges under subordinate officers and joined in military expeditions under Vere 's command . He was also aided by his two brothers , Horace and Robert Vere , Sir Nicholas Parker , and a number of other captains who if less exalted in rank than the noblemen of Leicester 's time were far more experienced and able . This contingent in the field serving directly under Vere 's orders , sometimes as part of the army under Count Maurice , sometimes in independent movements , was never at this time more than 1200 infantry and 400 cavalry , a small body if looked on as an army , // but active and efficient far beyond its numbers if compared with earlier more stationary conditions , and if judged by its adaptability to the work it had in hand . Vere was not given the political powers of Willoughby , much less those of Leicester . He retained the title of sergeant-major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The English government practically withdrew from the civil affairs of the republic , except as it could influence them through its diplomatic representative at the Hague , who still remained , in accordance with the treaty of 1585 , a member of the council of state , but who was much more actively occupied in negotiations with the estates general , which had taken over so many of the council 's powers . The military operations under these more active conditions can hardly be followed in detail , but their main course must be traced . In August , 1589 , as already indicated , Vere , with some 65o troops , took part in the successful defence of the Bommelwart against the threatened advance of Parma . Twice in the later months of 1589 , he was sent by the estates in command of some nine hundred Englishmen and an additional body of Dutch soldiers to relieve Rheinberg , a hard-pressed outpost of the Provinces on the Rhine far to the east of Gelderland . He was successful in both of these expeditions , outwitting the besiegers in one case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasions replenishing the stores of the besieged and withdrawing in safety . The plans for the surprise of Breda , early in 1590 , were talked over with Vere by the Dutch commanders , and with six hundred English soldiers he was with the victorious troops that rushed so unexpectedly into that important stronghold in the early dawn of March 4th . During the spring of 1590 , nine English companies were among the troops who occupied the Betuwe and prepared the entrenchments opposite Nymwegen which were so effective the next year . In July , while Maurice was engaged in reducing a number of towns in North Brabant , Vere with a purely English force of eight hundred infantry // and five hundred cavalry made a rapid march across the moors into Westphalia , where Recklinghausen and other outlying towns held by the rebellious provinces badly needed succor . He was successful in scattering the Spanish besieging force , and on his return march captured for the estates an important fort on the lower Rhine opposite Wesel . ' During the last four months of 1590 , while Parma was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Paris , Elizabeth , following a bolder policy than was usual with her , set her heart on an invasion of the southern provinces he had left thus relatively unprotected . Desirous both of a diversion that would force Parma to return and thus relieve Henry , and of the " spoil of Flanders , " she urged upon the estates , Count Maurice and her own commanders in the Netherlands a vigorous advance in favor of the common cause . She called their attention to the success of some recent raids made from Ostende , offered to the estates the unhampered use of the English troops in the Netherlands , and even talked of sending over some additional troops for the purpose . But she underrated the difficulty and expense of such a general movement and to her great disappointment nothing was done until the next spring . ' In the meantime Vere was offered by the queen his choice whether to take command of a regiment under Norris now in Brittany or to remain in his interesting but somewhat unpromising position as commander of the English irregular forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old position and before the year 1591 was over had built up , along with Count Maurice , on the advances of the years 1589 and 1590 a substantial structure of progress in the work of regainTHE // ing the northern Netherlands from the Spaniards . In May a stratagem gave him control of the outlying defences of the city of Zutphen , which had been betrayed by the English traitor Yorke some years before . He dressed up a number of his soldiers in the costume of market men and women , provided them with weapons to wear under their clothes , and sent them in small groups early in the morning to gather outside the fortified entrance to the ferry from the defences to the city . Then he ordered some horsemen to make a feint on the forts , the gates were opened to let in the peasants gathered outside , the disguise of his men was thrown off and they soon had possession of the forts from the inside . With Vere in possession of this advantageous position , Maurice laid formal siege to Zutphen itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Dutch then pressed on down the river Yssel to Deventer , the capital of the province of Overyssel , which with the English help they captured in June . Vere then accompanied Maurice on a rapid march far to the north where Delfziel on the Dollart , one of the places through which the Spaniards brought supplies from Germany , was captured . By July , however , Parma had retufned from France and with his usual vigor had transported an army across the Waal into Gelderland and besieged the Dutch forts prepared in 1590 for a later advance on Nymegen . The dash and ingenuity of Vere seems to have been relied on by Maurice and the estates to break up this attack . He justified this trust , for in a series of skirmishes , feigned retreats and ambushes , supported by an obstinate defence of the earthworks , he prolonged the contest till so late in the season that Parma , in ill health as he was , withdrew his army in October , not only permitting the English and Dutch allies to retain their former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capture it the same month . Thus the close of the year 1591 saw a distinct improvement in the military fortunes of the young republic over their depressing state when Willoughby retired in 1589 , notwithstanding the withdrawal of 1500 // seasoned troops for a campaign in Brittany which had been by this time begun and their replacement by recruits . ' Although there were no English troops in France in the year 1590 , except the few volunteers who were with Henry at Ivry , it was not because they were not asked for , or for lack of communication between the two sovereigns . An active correspondence was carried on . In the first place , while Henry was besieging Paris again , Elizabeth wrote him a peculiarly cold and hard as well as intrusive letter , protesting against his laxity in allowing a number of old men , women and children to leave the city during the midst of the siege , thus prolonging its resistance , as she thought , by too easy a show of mercy . At about the same time , on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and sent it to him accompanied by a pleasant letter in her own handwriting . In the course of the summer she wrote him six times , four times in her own hand . Besides these letters sent directly to the king , on the 13th of August she dictated to her secretary a vivacious letter to the French ambassador from " Oteland , upon a Wednesday night , after hir coming from hunting . " It was to accompany an emerald which she was sending as a present to Henry , " with her good will and affection and hopes that he will beat down all his enemies and put them to flight . " She reminds the king suggestively that emeralds are said to possess the quality that they will not break so long as the owner keeps his faith entire and firm . She invites the ambassador to come out and spend a few days hunting with her , and closes by saying " Meanwhile I send you part of the fruit of my labors to-day . I was myself where the beast fell dead and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of gratitude for help already given and of urgent appeals for further grants of men and money . He warned the queen of the necessity of protecting Normandy and Brittany and the danger of a second Armada if the Spaniards should get a footing in either of those provinces . In October , a new ambassador , Viscount Turenne , came to // England with the same request , and finding little encourage-ment passed on into Scotland and Germany in search of recruits . ' More than three fourths of the critical year 1590 passed away before Elizabeth gave any favorable reply to such appeals . Then news arrived in England that forced her to a decision . Parma , with 12,000 foot and 3000 horse , entered France from the eastern border , as already stated , in August . Only two months later , on the 12th of October , a Spanish force landed in the west . This incursion had been long prepared for . The League governor of Brittany , Philip Emmanuel de Lorraine , duke of Mercceur , in August , 1589 , sent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for assistance in men , money and munitions in aid of the Catholic cause against the governor representing Henry IV , the heretic king . He offered Philip in return the use of the Breton ports for his naval operations . The king was much interested , sent an envoy , Diego Moldanado , with a cordial letter in reply , ordered that Merceeur should be immediately supplied with ammunition , and promised to send money and men later.2 It was not only the Catholic cause and the Breton sea-ports that aroused Philip 's ready interest . His wife , Eliza-beth of France , was descended from Anne , the last heiress of Brittany , and Philip saw from the beginning a vague possibility of reestablishing the old ducal line in the person of his own daughter . He instructed his envoy therefore to investigate the circumstances by which Brittany had been united to France and the feeling of the inhabitants of the country toward the union . In the course of these inquiries Moldanado learned that care would be necessary since there was some dread of the landing of Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims , but he assured // the principal inhabitants that the object of the king was only to help the Catholic faith . Mercceur , also , probably , had ambitions beyond the mere administration of his governorship . His wife , Marie de Luxembourg , was , like the wife of Philip , descended from the old dukes of Brittany , though not in so direct a line , and long afterwards he expressed his regret that he had made so little of his pretensions . ' These ulterior interests of governor and king did not of course appear in the open negotiations for Spanish assistance , though their presence undoubtedly influenced the policy which was adopted . In March , 1590 , Mercceur despatched another envoy to urge haste in sending the promised succor and in July complained that the fine army which he had prepared to join the Spaniards when they should make their descent had dis-solved to gather in their harvests . Philip then sent word that 3000 men were on their way ; but it was not until three months later that this body of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period their numbers were defective , their condition bad and their pay in arrears . Some immediately went into hospital at Nantes and others scattered through the country foraging for the food which they had no money to buy . However , they were soon gathered together again by their commander , Don Juan d ' Aguila , a junction was made with the forces of the League under Mercceur , and they marched westward and laid siege to Hennebon . This city , lying two leagues inland and com-manding Blavet , the most available harbor for the landing of further Spanish troops in Brittany , had been captured the year before by the royalist governor of the province . The strong force now brought against it forced its commander to capitulate with all his artillery and Hennebon became for the future in a certain sense the fortified base of the Spanish invaders ; while Blavet , the modern Port Louis , became their port of entry into Brittany . Philip wanted Brest , a // much more valuable seaport , but under the circumstances it was impracticable to turn it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns of Brittany , especially the seaports , either took possession of the castles that controlled their streets and harbors , as at St. Malo , and carried on their trade independently of both contestants , or else , as at Brest and Morlaix , they exercised such a dominating influence over the commander that he was not at liberty to act without their approval . The estates of Brittany must also be reckoned with . The freedom with which the military governors could dispose of the walled towns of the country was thus very much restricted , and their operations were largely in the open country , the villages and the smaller towns . Therefore , although the governor claimed to be able to offer Philip Brest , Morlaix and three other towns in Lower Brittany and there was much correspondence on the subject , Blavet remained the only harbor in Spanish hands . ' Report exaggerated the troops that landed in October to 5000 , and there were widespread rumors that additional forces were being prepared in Ferrol and Corunna to re-inforce those already in Brittany . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did disembark at Blavet . Another rumor spread that the duke of Parma and his army instead of attacking the king before Paris would make a detour and march rapidly across France to join the other Spanish troops and take possession of the whole province of Brittany . These occurrences and reports made a profound impres-sion . The prince of Dombes , the king 's governor , wrote to the estates of Brittany appealing to them not to yield their country to the Spaniards to become the scene of the same tyranny and cruelty that was devastating the Netherlands . If they would not give him help he begged them at least to remain impartial spectators of the struggle between his forces and those of the League and Spain . He wrote at the same time to Turenne in England , appealing through him to // the queen for two thousand troops , which he promised the French king would pay for . The estates of Brittany , which met in December , 1590 , proved to have a native , if not a royalist majority , and also looked across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king 's permission to ask the queen of England , as being the most interested sovereign , to send a force of two thousand men into Brittany , at their expense , equipped to help in the resistance to the Spaniards and Leaguers . Their deputies found Henry at Senlis January 20 , 1591 , and ex-perienced no difficulty in obtaining from him the necessary authority . Gabriel Hux , treasurer of the estates of Brittany , and one of the deputies arrived in London a week later and presented the request of the estates to the queen . These urgent appeals were , indeed , scarcely necessary . Elizabeth had heard from other sources the news of the dis-embarkation of the Spaniards , and had realized the necessity of action . She was always sensitive to the acquisition by the Spaniards of any further influence on the opposite side of the channel , and although Blavet and Hennebon lay far to the south she perceived clearly enough that a firm footing of the Spaniards anywhere in Brittany would be most dangerous to the interests of England . The reports of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parma 's army to the west reached England in their most ample form and were generally believed . Sir Roger Williams in a memorial on the military conditions of the time declared that it would be better for England to allow the Spaniards to have five other provinces than Brittany , and that at least eight thousand English troops ought to be sent thither . Elizabeth had therefore determined to prepare a new army to be sent to France , to meet the danger in Brittany , even before the appeals of the king , the prince of Dombes and the Breton estates reached her . These appeals nevertheless served to confirm her wayward resolution and gave a welcome oppor-tunity to charge the expense of the expedition to the French . ' // In the middle of January , 1591 , she issued orders for the levy of three thousand troops , and soon afterward despatched Sir Edmund Yorke to France to see what were the best terms that could be arranged with the king . He was instructed to express the queen 's surprise that Henry had not himself immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to cut off the duke of Parma from any advance on that province . At the same time he was to state that she had offered the French ambassador two or three thousand troops if Henry would pay for them and grant her reasonable requests . The most important of these requests were that the king would give some better security for the repayment of the sums she had already loaned and was now about to spend in his defence , and that he would grant to her the use of the harbor of Brest as an anchorage for her shipping and the town as a place of lodging and refuge for her soldiers . The French ambassador in England was provided with a copy of the queen 's instructions , but the negotiations took place directly between Henry and Yorke , who soon brought back the king 's reply , dated March 4th . There was little difficulty about the first demand . Henry was never niggardly in promises . He gave full power to his representatives to sign all possible documents promising full repayment for everything . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a military and naval base , he was somewhat more cautious . This on the other hand was a favorite idea with Elizabeth . To obtain some kind of a territorial foothold in France was an ever present if a somewhat vague hope in her mind . The loss of Calais had never been forgotten . The occupation of Havre in 1562 as a gage for the help she gave the Huguenots at that time may have suggested the possibility of a substitute for the ancient possession of England on the French side of the channel . She already held two towns in pledge in the Netherlands , and the practice of giving temporary possession of towns as security for loans , guarantees of good faith or places of refuge was well established in European inter-1 // national relations . Elizabeth declared in her instructions to Yorke " It hath ben a thing usual among Princes that are succored , if ye succor passes the sea , to have some certain place for safety of men and shipping . " Henry had offered to the German princes such border cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the civil wars in France had been fortified by the grant of the occupation of certain towns by the leaders of each party . Although she probably did not know that Philip was negotiating with Mercceur at the same time for possession of the same city , she knew that he had been offered other towns by the League , and had recently occupied and fortified Blavet . Why should she not obtain a cautionary town in France ? Besides this fixed idea in Elizabeth 's mind there was good ground for her claim that a place for ready disembarkation and possible retreat was necessary to the safety of her ships and troops , as the event proved . Henry on the other hand was both now and afterward suspicious of Elizabeth 's desire for the control of a seaport . He feared , perhaps with reason , that once in her hands it would never be given up . He answered therefore at this time somewhat cautiously that the queen might use the harbor and town of Brest , as well as his other towns , as freely as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Brest , however , he excused himself from delivering to English occupation , on the ground that such action would be looked upon with great disfavor by his adherents among the Catholic nobles of France . As a substitute for this strong city , however , he offered to allow Elizabeth to capture from the League , fortify and place under any commander she might choose , a little seashore place named Relaner , which had been partly fortified sometime before . Although no definite agreement seems to have been entered into on the point of numbers , the French ambassador gave the queen to understand that Henry would see that a body of royalist troops double that of the army she was sending // would join it in Brittany . With such general offers on the French side Elizabeth had to be content . ' The command of the expedition was given to Sir John Norris , who since his return from the Portugal voyage had been considered for the charge of the expedition to Normandy which Willoughby had led , then sent for a short period of service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The reputation of Norris as a soldier was beyond question , but complaint had more than once been made of his impa-tience of control and his unwillingness to consider the views of those who shared responsibility with him . The failure of the Portugal expedition was charged by some to his pre-cipitancy , and now Burghley was warned by a correspondent that similar failure could only be avoided by forming a council of officers and requiring Norris to respect its advice . But whether wisely or unwisely no such restriction was included in the commission that was given to him . He became , January 11 , 1591 , " General of the Queen 's army in Brittany , " a title which he was destined to retain for more than four years . His first duty led him , however , again to the Netherlands . The difficulty of sending raw recruits to meet a trained army was clearly recognized , and Henry had begged for veteran troops for this service . They could be found , as usual , only in the Low Countries , and although it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elizabeth agreed that the three thousand troops for the expedition to Brittany should be drawn thence and replaced by newly levied English troops . Norris was therefore sent to the Netherlands , as before the Portugal expedition , to use his personal influence in persuading both Dutch and English authorities to agree to the departure of the seasoned men . Even his persuasions , however , were ineffective , and after many alterations of plan a compromise was arranged . Ten companies , making up fifteen hundred men , one half of the // proposed force , were to be taken from the Netherlands and replaced by new troops from England ; the other ten com-panies should be made up of men recruited in the south-western counties of England and sent directly from thence to France . The weakness of absolutely new troops had , however , been made so manifest in Willoughby 's expedition that even the recruits sent to the Netherlands and France were selected as far as possible from those who had been soldiers before , and the county authorities were allowed to take one half of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This requirement did not , however , guaran-tee soldierly qualities . Norris complained bitterly that half of the Somersetshire contingent were " the worst men and the worst furnished he ever saw , " and that he would be forced to leave many of them behind , " the men being so poor and weak that they will scarce endure the passage by sea . " He was equally dissatisfied with their equipment and the sup-plies furnished for them . He had much higher ideals of the requirements of food for the troops than the queen and her official councillors , and in February was busy holding con-ferences with London merchants as to the provision of beef , beer , bread and biscuits for the troops during the month which would be required to place them in Brittany . All these negotiations and arrangements involved , as usual , much delay , notwithstanding the continued presence and urgency of the representative of the estates of Brittany , the repeated letters of Henry transmitting to the queen rumors of the coming of new troops to Blavet and the arrival in March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the early days of April , the troops destined for the Netherlands were gathered in the south-eastern ports , those intended to be sent directly to France at Portsmouth and Southampton . April llth , the general , // his brother , Sir Henry Norris , Captain Anthony Sherley and the other principal officers rode by post from London to Southampton , where they spent a week in completing the preparations . While here a change of plan was ordered by the queen . Six hundred of the troops were detached from the main body and sent under Sir Roger Williams to Dieppe to assist the governor of that city in its defence , but only under very special circumstances to take part in any action outside . Elizabeth was anxious that Dieppe should not fall into the hands of the enemy , but not ready as yet to risk English troops again in the field in Normandy . On the 27th of April the army for Brittany set sail in twenty-three ships , and on the eve of the 3oth arrived in the roads of the Isle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet them there had been delayed . Some were compelled to run into Dover for additional supplies on the 26th . On Monday , May 3rd , however , they arrived at Jersey and found Norris awaiting them ; the next morning they all sailed together , and at night anchored in the harbor of Paimpol , almost the most northerly point on the rugged coast of Brittany . The sudden appearance of the English fleet and the chance capture of a vessel loaded with fish and salt sailing from the Isle of Brehac to St. Maio led to the surrender of Brehac and the small places on the adjacent coast to the English . Paimpol and its whole neighborhood were thus left quietly to their possession . The little Breton town looking to the setting sun across its wide bay became for some years practically an English possession . Although it went out of their hands temporarily more than once it was promptly recaptured , and expedition after expedition from England made its way into its harbor . Some of its old dwellings are still known as the English houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coast and back from it inland are familiar names in the English records of the time . Norris occupied as headquarters the neighboring abbey of Beauport , from which he reported his arrival to the council . After a week spent in marshalling his soldiers he joined the // prince of Dombes , and on the loth of May they pressed inland to Guingamp , the nearest large town . As the army approached the town they saw its outlying houses burning and hastened forward to seize such as could be saved . In those days of closely walled towns the suburbs , which in time of peace and prosperity spread far beyond the walls , in time of war were sacrificed promptly and ruthlessly by their own possessors , if they had time , rather than leave them as a cover to the enemy . The one cannon and two culverins possessed by Norris were put in position and used with such good effect that on the third day , after four hundred shot had been fired , a small breach was made in the walls . Although the artillery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not come , with the usual French precipitancy he urged Norris to an immediate assault , to which the general reluctantly agreed . The French demanded permission to lead the assault but Norris claimed that privilege for the English . All the English captains wanted to be first in the attempt , and to avoid contention the general caused them , according to the custom of the time , to throw dice to decide who should lead the first two hundred men to the assault . The fate that gave Captain Heron the leadership prepared at the ramparts a pike thrust for his throat , of which he died the next day . A Captain Dennis , who attempted an escalade , was shot and killed at the same time , as well as some forty soldiers . How-ever , after the failure of two assaults and ten days more of battery , on May 24th Guingamp surrendered and the French and English entered the old town together . ' Norris wished then to push on along the coast to Morlaix , whose Leaguer merchants , carrying on a half-smuggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old thorn in the side of the English . But a report came that Mercceur with his combined forces had broken up his camp at Pontivy near Hennebon , and was himself marching by way of Corlay // to anticipate them at Morlaix . The allied English and royalists marched southward to intercept him , but instead of fighting a battle the two armies took up their positions , the English and royalists at Chatelaudren , the Leaguers and Spaniards at the village of Queremer , north of Corlay , four or five miles from the English camp . Between them lay one of the open heaths so characteristic of Brittany , where the remaining three weeks of the month of June were spent in skirmishing , night attempts to cut off outlying parties of the enemy , " revenges " and other inconclusive actions . The English and royalists claimed that Mercceur would not come into the open field to fight , notwithstanding their repeated invitations . It would ? seem that neither of the two hostile armies was strong enough to force a battle on the other , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously to do so . In the early days of July the English army broke up its camp , marched eastward and occupied the large and wealthy town of Lamballe , the Leaguer garrison withdrawing to the castle , which was then besieged . In the fighting before this castle several English and French officers were killed , among the latter de la Noue , who had joined them at Chatelaudren with the counts of Montgomery and Combourg and a number of French volunteers . He could ill be spared . The French contingent was discouragingly small in this whole campaign . Instead of providing twice the number of the English they were never probably half as many . The marquis of Villeneuve appeared for a while with two hundred and twenty horse and seven hundred foot ; but such volunteers came and went , and the prince of Dombes frequently had so few under his command as to form little more than an inconsiderable adjunct to the English army . In the middle of July the siege of Lamballe castle was abandoned at the news of the arrival of Mercceur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent in skirmishes between the two forces . But no pitched battle took place and no important captures were made on either side . Instead there was a constant series of encampments , dislodgments // and marches from one spot to another . The English army passed from Montcontour to St. Brieuc , then back to Col-linec , thence to St. Meen , Breal , Chateaugiron , St. Aubin , St. Allaire , Fougeres Ernee , Couringe , working their way eastward , but apparently seldom if ever meeting the enemy , and only occasionally capturing for the king a castle or unimportant town . In the middle of November , rather unexpectedly , the enemy were driven out of the castle of Dorec , and the English Captain Latham was placed in it as governor , but this was a petty conquest . ' Both armies were declining in numbers . Notwithstanding the constant rumors of Spanish reinforcements none came , after April , during the whole remainder of 1591 and ten months of 1592 . In July , 1591 , Merceeur had altogether but 3720 men in the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of June six hundred troops were levied and sent over to fill the deficiency which had existed ever since Williams ' detachment had been sent to Normandy ; in July two hundred volunteers , some horses and supplies were sent from England . Money enough had been taken over to pay the wages of the troops till the end of September , and through the autumn additional money , food and clothing were sent over from time to time . But no more men reached Brittany and other supplies were at best irregular and inadequate . A number of the officers were killed and several licensed to return to England . The total numbers can scarcely have reached two thousand . As the autumn came on the soldiers suffered severely from cold and sickness . Norris sent letters to England every few weeks and some news made its way to court indirectly through the English ambassador at Henry 's court . But there was little communication in the other direction . For some months the little English army remained an almost detached , unsup-ported and independent force.2 // There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Norris had suffered no defeat , but he had also accomplished little . The French had obviously not carried out their engagement to keep 6000 regular troops in the field in Brittany . Those that had come there from Normandy had either been withdrawn or disbanded and many of the Breton volunteers abandoned the army in the fall to attend to the harvesting of their crops . Of this Eliza-beth complained bitterly in letters both to Henry and the prince of Dombes , and threatened repeatedly that she would withdraw all her troops from Brittany unless the king and the governor fulfilled their agreement . As a warning , in August she ordered the warships then in the Channel to go to Jersey to convoy the English troops home as soon as Norris should send word that he was ready to return . ' In Brittany there was some friction between the English and French commanders . In August Dombes and his councillors planned a joint campaign involving the departure of the English from the coast for the " high parts of Brittany , " toward Rennes . To this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the queen and against his judgment of what was good strategy . His troops were also in such poor con-dition that he felt it impossible for them to depart on such a campaign without some weeks of recuperation in a town or settled encampment . He put these arguments in writing and laid them before the French governor , and at the same time sent a copy of his protest to the queen . Elizabeth approved of his objection , ordered him to come home rather than take his army so far inland , and through her ambassador protested to the king against the plan . She wished to fight her own battles in France , not Henry 's . Dombes on the other hand showed his dissatisfaction by refusing to join Norris in a proposed resumption of the siege of the castle of Lamballe , and objected to his plan for an attack on Corlay and Craon . The campaign into upper Brittany ceased to be urged as a // definite project , but as a matter of fact the general move-ment of the English army during the autumn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It passed across the alternate moors and cultivated tracts of Brittany , through a score of towns and villages , stopping a day or a few days at each , till it got as far eastward as Gouron . There it lay for two months . In January there was a momentary proba-bility of more vigorous action . The prince of Conty came into Brittany to join the prince of Dombes , and they held a conference with Norris at Vitre on the 11th of January , 1J92 , as to future plans . It was evident that nothing of a serious nature could be accomplished with the forces in their present condition , and at the request of the French leaders Sir Henry Norris , lieutenant to the general , was sent over to England with letters to the queen asking her to reinforce her troops in Brittany . He left Laval for England by way of Caen , January 28th . He passed on the way a messenger bringing to Brittany letters giving the general the permis-sion to return to England for which at a period of discourage-ment he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the later message concerning reinforcements , Norris went directly to England , leaving his troops in camp at Gouron under the command of Captain Anthony Wingfield , sergeant major of the expedition . He reached Caen February 21st , sailed on the 28th , reached Portsmouth on the 1st of March , and on the 8th was writing to France from his house at Puddle Wharf in London . The expedition to Brittany had thus been brought to at least a temporary close , with the general and his second in command both in England , and the army , now reduced to about twelve hundred men , lying for the time inactive in eastern Brittany . ' CHAPTER XIII // B RITTANY was not the only region of France in which English troops were engaged during the year 1591 . The campaign in Normandy of the summer and fall of that year , the central point of which was the siege of Rouen , was one of the best known military events of the time and has left an abundant contemporary literature both in England and France . A variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Henry IV . One of these was particularly insistent in the years 1590 and 1591 . In addition to her dread of the extension of Spanish power , the desire to increase her influence across the channel , the personal solicitations of Henry , and possibly a certain amount of religious sympathy with him and his party , she could not disregard the urgent appeals of her favorite , the earl of Essex , for an opportunity to win military glory . Essex was gifted and highspirited . He had great political ambitions , and a military career seemed the shortest route by which to attain power . So long as he stayed at home , the " domesticall greatness , " which some of his friends urged him to seek , must be dwarfed by that of the influential lord chancellor and the aged lord treasurer . If he won great success in war he might override their influence . He was deeply in debt and hoped , like other military men of the time , that a successful campaign , with its chances of plunder , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or of such brilliant exploits as would demand a reward at home , would free him from this burden . His surreptitious participation in the Portugal expedition had accomplished neither of these results , though it had giyen him a certain credit in arms and had whetted his appetite for war . 2S4 A HISTORY OF ENGLAND The career of Henry had a special attraction for Essex . The chivalrous character of the French king , his arduous struggle for the crown , his evident need of assistance against a stronger enemy , all seemed like a chapter of old romance , and Essex frequently grieved over his lack of freedom to join him and the hard fate which condemned him to the life of a royal favorite . Henry wrote to him , as he did to other influential English councillors , and Essex in all his correspondence asked with eager interest for news of the war in France . In November , 1589 , during Willoughby 's campaign , he writes from court to the French captain de la Noue , " I should be very happy to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve the common weal . I am idle here , and have nothing to do but to hearken for such opportunities . " When , in October , 1590 , Viscount Turenne came to England to solicit troops , Essex gladly acceded to Henry 's request to use his influence in gaining the queen 's assent , hoping himself to be their leader . But the effort to induce the queen to send a new army to France was at that time unavailing . The expedition to Brittany , sent a few months later , was based upon different claims , and had special requirements which only a veteran commander like Norris could fill . Afterwards , however , conditions became more favorable for Essex . When in March , 1591 , de Reaux arrived bringing a new appeal from Henry not only for haste in sending troops to Brittany but for three thousand more footmen for a campaign in Normandy , it seemed that the opportunity of Essex had come . Possibly the despatch in April of Sir Roger Williams , a close personal friend of Essex , to Dieppe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a partial concession to this request . But if so it did not satisfy the applicants . Neither Henry nor Essex allowed Elizabeth to forget their wishes . The king wrote again later in April . Essex told the French ambassador that he had knelt before the queen more than two hours at a time on three occasions , begging permission to go to France , and although he had // been refused each time he was still hoping to obtain leave . On the 3rd of June Henry sent de Reaux over for a second time with a letter thanking the queen in the most submissive and adulatory terms for sending Norris and Williams , prais-ing highly the service the latter had just performed outside of Dieppe and begging for four thousand men for Normandy . Doubtless instructed by the reports of his ambassadors he asked that the earl of Essex should be their leader , although at the same time he deprecated interfering with the queen 's choice of a commander and apologized for his ambassadors ' audacity in making such a suggestion . Essex on his knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ambassadors and the steady pressure of Elizabeth 's most serious counsellors made a combined assault that was irresistible , and late in June the queen , reluctantly , and , as she frequently declared , against her better judgment , agreed to the despatch of a new expedition into France , of which Essex was to be the general . News had just come of the early successes of Norris in Brittany . On the loth of June , 1591 , Essex , exultant and optimistic as usual , writes to a friend , " I am commanded into France for the establishment of the brave king in quiet possession ' of Normandy . " I On the 24th of June letters were sent through the counties ordering the levy of 3400 men , which with the 600 of Sir Roger Williams already in Dieppe would make up the 4000 for which Henry had finally asked . These troops were levied from fourteen counties , including some in the north as well as the southern and midland shires . There was no question in this case of obtaining veteran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given the most stringent instructions as to the careful choice and equipment of the recruits . A good supply of ordnance and ammunition was later provided , partly from the Tower , partly from the Island of Guernsey . After the levy of the troops had begun , it was ordered that a cornet of roo horse should be organ256 A HISTORY OF ENGLAND ized and substituted for 250 footmen . For a while it seemed that cavalry was to take a more prominent part in English warfare than it had played for a long time . Essex organized a private troop of horse , made up of his friends and depend-ants , serving at his expense . All his tenants were called on to pay the sums provided for in their antiquated leases to equip men to follow him when he should go in his own person to war , and this money he used in supporting additional horse . A number of mounted gentlemen volunteers also joined him . When Henry wrote in July stating how happy he was to learn that Essex was coming over , he begged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which to levy 500 cavalry in England . But this loan was refused and the army remained , as was true of all the English armies of this period , essentially a foot force . The army for Normandy , as finally constituted , consisted , in addition to the cavalry , of twenty-one companies of foot-men . They were placed under carefully chosen if somewhat young captains , ? Wingfields , Baskervilles , Careys , Morgans , Poores , Cliffords , Gorings and other names now becoming famous in England from the exploits of members of those families in France , the Netherlands , Portugal and Ireland . " I have not known so gallant a troope goe out of England with so many young and untrained commanders , " writes Sir Thomas Wilkes to Sir Robert Sidney . Essex himself was but twenty-six years of age and the queen insisted that Sir Thomas Leighton , governor of the Isle of Jersey , and Sir Henry Killigrew should accompany him not only as officers of the camp and field but as authoritative counsellors . Leigh-ton 's familiarity with the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitable . The English ambassador in France was also instructed to watch over Essex and give him advice as to his actions , even if unpalatable. ' // As in previous cases , the equipment of this force suffered some interruption , and on the morning of the fifteenth of July messengers were sent posting into various counties with orders from the queen to hold back the troops appointed to be ready at the seaports by the twentieth of that month . In the afternoon she had changed her mind again , these orders were as hastily revoked , and the preparations con-tinued . The great stumbling-block in the way of the de-parture of the troops was no doubt the contemplated absence of Essex . The queen had long before this become so fond of him that she could scarcely bear him out of her sight . His flight to Portugal with Drake and Norris in 1589 and his marriage in 1590 had both been forgiven rather than to see him gloomy or to miss him from her court altogether . She was unhappy unless she saw him daily , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country for an indefinite period . On the other hand her statesman-like recognition of the circumstances of the time showed the desirability of further intervention in France and her word had already been given to Essex that he should be the leader of her forces there . ' A second difficulty was the financial one . The early loans to Henry had not been repaid . The equipment and trans-port of the expedition of Norris to Brittany had cost more than ? 2000 , and its running expenses amounted to some ? 3500 a month . Although the organization of the army had been begun before a formal engagement had been entered into , Elizabeth had no mind to go to still greater expense without additional security , if it could be obtained . The possibility of a territorial foothold also again presented itself , not now in the form of a city of refuge but of one or more towns to be held in pawn for the repayment of the debt . While Essex impatiently waited , a series of conferences was held between the two French ambassadors on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other . Terms were // finally arranged and an agreement signed August 14 , 1591 . Elizabeth agreed to complete the preparation of the army the equipment of which had been already begun and to pay them for two months from the time of their disembarkation in France . After the two months , if they remained in France , they were to be paid weekly , or at furthest monthly , by the French king directly . All the loans previously made by Eliz-abeth to Henry , the expenses of Sir John Norris in Brittany , the cost of equipment of the troops now being prepared for Normandy and their wages for two months were acknowl-edged by the French ambassadors as valid debts . For the payment of these debts it was agreed that all the taxes and income of every kind coming to the French crown in Rouen and Havre should be collected by officials of Elizabeth , from the time when these two cities should by the joint efforts of French and English be captured until the full debt was repaid . To guarantee this payment the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In order to make this agreement effective it was to be accepted by the king and sealed in the French chancery . ' The closer military and financial relations arising from the presence of two English armies in France seemed to call for a closer diplomatic connection , and in place of Sir Edward Stafford , who had lately returned , a new ambassador was appointed and sent over at the same time as Essex . This as Sir Henry Unton . The commission of Essex was signed July 21 , 1591 , the instructions of Unton , July 24 ; they were both at Dover on the 27th , and arrived with the troops in Dieppe August 2 , exactly three months after the arrival of Norris and his forces in Brittany . This army was equipped on the whole the most promptly and with the greatest care of any sent out during this period . Elizabeth boasted that but three weeks intervened between her consent to its levy and the assembling of the troops , but her calculation differs somewhat from that of the state papers . Essex was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive the congratulations of the French on its appearance , instead of feeling ashamed of his command , as had been the experience of both Willoughby and Norris . Yet it was destined to accomplish the least of any of the English expeditions to France and to suffer quite as much as any . Its movements were hampered by the queen 's original instructions . It was not allowed to leave Dieppe till the financial agreement with the French ambassadors had been ratified by the king , sealed by the chancellor at Nantes , confirmed by the parlement at Tours and returned to Essex to be transmitted to England , a process which required three weeks to complete . Additional ordnance had to be brought from the Island of Guernsey , which required a month more . Week after week the army lay idle in its entrenchments at Arques , doomed to inaction , partly by the necessity of waiting for the countersignature of the treaty and the completion of its equipment , partly by the absence of the king from Normandy . While the army is lying inactive in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while to make a rapid survey of the situation of the various bodies of English troops at this time of the furthest extension of Elizabethan military operations . Sir John Norris with his little body of some two thousand or three thousand men was slowly marching from place to place eastward through Brittany , getting further and further away from Paimpol , his original base . Two hundred miles to the east , in Normandy , not only was Essex with his four thousand men lying in camp at Arques , but Dieppe , although under a French governor , was in many ways an English station . Otwell Smith , an English official , was regularly established there and had hired a warehouse for the storage and issue of supplies to the English troops . Many English merchants were there for the sale of their goods to Henry 's soldiers and subjects , and English vessels came constantly into and out of the harbor on private or government service . One hundred and twenty-five miles further to the north26o A HISTORY OF ENGLAND eastward along the coast , at Ostende @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by English troops and under English governors . Flushing , Berghen-op-Zoom , Brielle and some smaller camps carried the series of stations seventy-five miles further . The troops in the field in the Netherlands had been weakened by the withdrawal of many of the old companies for service in Brittany and the substitution of new recruits ; nevertheless it was the summer months of 1591 that saw the recapture by the joint forces of Vere and Maurice of Zutphen and Nymegen , the principal cities of Gelderland , Deventer , the capital of Overyssel , and Delfziel in the far northern province of Groningen . Later in the winter of 1591 Vere and a body of English troops were with the futile expedition for the surprise of Dunkirk and the general received there a wound in the leg that put an end to his activity for some months while he lay in the hospital at the Hague . ' There were also a few English volunteers on the continent directly in the French and Netherlands service . Thus some ten or twelve thousand English troops were established at six or eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in addition to such troops as were in Ireland and such war ships as were upon the sea . These numbers were by no means large for England 's population , and their expenses were by no means great in proportion to England 's resources , if any adequate means had existed for drawing on those resources . They were quite numerous enough however to make this distinctly a war period for England . The com-ing and going of soldiers , the creation of a group of " men of the sword , " as a contemporary chronicler calls the officers , the appearance of the soldier as a stock character on the stage , and a new element of disorder in the country , the growth of martial law , and the pamphlets that were published recount-ing military adventures and experiences gave one additional phase to the many-sided interests of these last decades of the reign of Elizabeth . In no one of the expeditions of the time was popular interest // keener than in that to Normandy . Its fortunes however did not flourish . The two rulers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set her mind firmly on an immediate siege and capture of Rouen . Henry on the other hand was not yet ready for joint operations , or at least not in Normandy , where alone the queen would approve of them . He was engaged in the siege of Noyon in Picardy , and on its surrender undertook the siege of the neighboring town of Pierrefonds . He had still other military needs pressing upon him which held him in the east of France , and here , much to the queen 's disapproval , Essex went to visit him . Sir Roger Williams , who had come over with the 600 men in March , had found his orders to remain in Dieppe irksome , and had taken advantage of the vagueness of his instructions to join the French in several military affairs . He had taken part in a successful attack on two regiments of Leaguers who were intercepted and defeated near Dieppe . He then drifted still further eastward and took part with Henry in the capture of Noyon on the 9th of August . He was immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and either of his own initiative or at Henry 's request urged Essex to visit the king in his camp in person in order to concert plans for the campaign . Essex , already weary of inaction and believing the journey necessary , left his foot-troops in camp near Dieppe , took his cavalry , and on the 14th of August galloped across country a hundred miles to meet Henry . It was a hot and dusty journey . Although it was midsummer they were forced to ride most of the way with all their armor on for fear of ambuscade by the enemy . The Leaguers held most of the country through which they were passing , and viewed their party from the hill tops as they passed . To many of the English it was the first experience of a country devastated by successive captures and ravagings , " the tokens of the lamentable warrs . " It was five days before they reached Picardy and the neighborhood of the king . The first interview of the earl with Henry was characteristic . A citizen of Compiegne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ description of his entrance into that city preceded by six pages on horseback in orange-colored velvet trimmed with gold lace , he himself and his horse covered from the shoulders with the same orange velvet strewn with pre-cious stones . Six trumpeters sounded before him , twelve squires rode after him , and he was followed by sixty English gentlemen . Henry , shabby but cordial , received him with delight , and summoned up enough English to cry to all those who followed Essex , " You are welcome . " He kept his guest at Noyon three days , showed him all possible courtesy , had some serious talk with him about their plans and afterward wrote to the queen that he would always consider the day he met Essex as one of the happiest of his life . The evening before their departure the king , Essex and the French nobles had a jumping match , and the loyal English chronicler records that " our lord general did overleape them all . " The serious side of the arrangements was less satisfactory . Henry was undoubtedly in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops in haste to Normandy , prob-ably without realizing the improbability that he could join them there immediately . Now he found himself unable to carry out what would be inferred to be his side of the bar-gain . There were on their way to France 5000 horse and II , 000 foot which Viscount Turenne had after long effort engaged in Saxony , Wurtemberg and Anhalt , a body of troops which Henry considered indispensable for his future opera-tions . These he must meet in person at the frontier if they were to be held together and brought further into the country . This would necessarily delay his appearance before Rouen for a month at least . If he had consulted his military judg-ment alone he would have preferred to carry the English forces with him to a junction of all his troops in the east of France ; but the queen neither at this time nor afterward could be brought to agree to this , and he must perforce , though reluctantly and only after delay , yield to her wish // to restrict the joint English and French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that Essex should return to his camp , that the siege of Pierrefonds should be given up , and that Marshal Biron with the bulk of the French forces should begin their march immediately toward Rouen , but that Henry should first proceed with a small body of cavalry to the eastern frontier , then return as soon as possi-ble , bringing the Germans with him , to join Essex and Biron before Rouen . This agreement seemed the best that could be obtained , so with it Essex and his little body of horse turned back toward their camp at Arques . He found his return not so easy as his coming had been . Villars , the League com-mander at Rouen , had learned of his movements and sent a considerable body of horse and foot to intercept him . Essex was obliged after reaching Gisors to turn to the southward , and with difficulty by some hard riding to cross the Seine at Vernon and reach Pont de 1'Arche , a town held for the king . From here , on the advice of his companions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot troops . After remaining at Pont de l'Arche for six days he heard of their arrival at Rea , the appointed rendezvous near Rouen , with a cornet of horse sent along with them by the governor of Dieppe . After some risky manceuvering the two bodies united and Essex was then at liberty to retrace his steps without danger of molesta-tion . He could not however withstand the temptation to make a " bravado " under the walls of Rouen as he passed near it . In the petty skirmish fought there one of the only two Englishmen killed was , to the deep sorrow of Essex , Walter Devereux , his only brother . The army reached its original camping place at Arques September loth , more than three weeks after the departure of Essex and the cavalry , instead of six days as originally expected . Many of the officers and men , the general included , were suffering from malaria . ' // But the worst of the misfortunes of Essex was the rising tide of the queen 's discontent . She watched " almoste hourlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her four times in the first two weeks of his absence , and still more infrequently later . The passage of messengers was difficult , and such letters as were sent reached her late and irregularly . She travelled down from Nonesuch to Portsmouth thinking that Essex and perhaps even Henry might come across the channel to visit her , but neither of them knew that she was near the coast till some weeks afterward . When she heard of Essex 's visit to the king she wrote him her strong disapproval . He ought not to have departed from Normandy without special license from her ; he had left the main part of his forces without a proper commander ; he had separated his army into two parts ; he had risked his own life ; he had exposed his troops purposelessly before Rouen . Henry 's determination to go to Champagne to join with the German reiters before coming in person to the siege of Rouen was equally distasteful to her . She wanted the siege to begin immediately , that no day should elapse in which her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only point in the campaign that she interested herself in . Henry 's request that Essex be allowed to join him in a campaign against his enemies in Champagne and Lorraine before entering upon the siege of Rouen stirred her wrath afresh . Even the commencement of warlike operations took a form that she disapproved of . September 12th , two days after the return of Essex to Arques , word came from Marshal Biron that he had come as far as Gournay , but that he thought it necessary to capture this town before besieging Rouen . After a few days ' interchange of discussions , Essex , his counsellors , and the ambassador decided , though with some trepidation , that it was safe to stretch the queen 's orders so far as to participate in the siege , and on the seventeenth the army broke up its camp at Arques and took its place outside the gates of Gournay . When Elizabeth heard that the English troops were taking part in this preliminary siege , Essex himEXPEDITION // self at the assault " trailing of a pike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong displeasure at the news . When the French decided that still another town , Caudebec , must be captured before it was safe to attack Rouen , the queen worked herself up into a belief that the king was deliberately mocking her , and that she had been treated with the grossest neglect and indignity . She wrote an angry rebuke to Unton for going to seek an interview with the king at Louviers , declaring that Henry ought to be treated with severity for his failure to keep his promise , not with the honor of being sought for by her ambassador . Although Henry in successive letters and through his ambassadors explained that military necessities frequently required change of plans , and assured her that he was following her wishes as far as was in any way possible , she was so violent in her com-plaints that the French ambassador prudently stayed away from court , this abstention giving her in turn new umbrage . All through August and much of September she was in con-stant ill-temper and sent personally and through the privy council , repeated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal officers of the expedition . The news from Brittany was bad , and she was disappointed and angry that Henry had not given better support to her troops there . She knew , of course , nothing of the military and but little of the political requirements of the situation , and was , as usual , judging the whole operation from a personal point of view , in which the absence of her favorite from court was the principal feature . ' By the middle of September she had fully determined to call back Essex and his forces at the expiration of the two months which had been set as the minimum time of their service . Orders to this effect were actually sent to the various parties concerned . The only concession she would // make was that if the king would give full proof of his ability and intention himself to pay the weekly wages of the troops and would use them only for the capture of Rouen and Havre , she would allow a part of them to remain a month or forty days longer under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Brittany at the same time . September 24 , 1591 , a public declaration of her reasons for the withdrawal of her forces was issued . ' But the storm gradually subsided . Elizabeth 's counsel-lors and officials , both in France and England , tried as far as they dared to dissuade her from precipitate action . Essex sent to the queen and the council a series of manly and outspoken letters , protesting against their misjudgment of his actions and the queen 's determination to humiliate him by a recall before any service done . As a protest against the denial to him of an opportunity to lead his men where they might hope for distinction , on the eighth of October he drew all his troops out in sight of Rouen , commanded the gentlemen to alight , and proceeded to knight twenty-four of them , a lavish grant of honors which was criticised by the queen and ministers and ridiculed by the populace at home . Gournay surrendered on the 26th of September and Caudebec on the 18th of October , and on the 23rd of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marching towards Normandy with his German mercenaries . Elizabeth herself shrank from what would seem a betrayal of the common cause by the withdrawal of her troops at this juncture . Be-fore the day announced for their return therefore Essex received letters from the queen and council permitting him to remain in France with his army for the month of October , although as before they were restricted in their movements to the siege of Rouen and Havre and their wages were to be paid directly by the French king . Subsequently permission was given for a still further continuance of the troops in the field . The queen 's better disposition was confirmed by a hasty visit to England made by Essex , at her immediate // command , early in October . He found her at Oatlands , stayed for a few days , and was back again in Dieppe on October i7th.1 The army of Essex had now been in France for ten weeks , and except for its rescue of its commander and his party on their return from Noyon , and the help given to Marshal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active service . It is true it had taken part in some skirmishing before Rouen immediately after the surrender of Gournay . A plan for a surprise was made and after long dispute dice were thrown first to decide which regiment , then which company should head the column of attack . " It was a world to see how men that were before dull with daunts , sickness and discontenta-tion pulled up their harts , " when there was some fighting to be done . But it was soon over with , for the time at least ; the army went into camp again at Arques , and even when Biron asked for five hundred men to help besiege Caudebec , Leighton , Essex being then in England , thought it safer to refuse . The army was already much depleted in numbers and weakened in character . Deaths from disease and accident , desertions and the return of gentlemen volunteers to England had been constant . English soldiers died of fever in the streets of Dieppe . Seven hundred sick were sent home at one time , eight hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a review late in October but two thou-sand men were well enough to appear . There was also much disorder . The troops were now nominally in the direct pay of the king of France , but they received little money , and the supplies provided by the French officials were irregular and inadequate . There was doubtless much point in the state-ment of one of the captains that " much more contented would we be in the paie of the blessed quene . " The soldiers were demoralized by their long inaction and irregular pay . They foraged recklessly in Arques and through the sur268 A HISTORY OF ENGLAND rounding country . They burned cottages , pillaged houses of the gentry and desecrated churches . The French governor of Dieppe complained bitterly of their excesses and appealed to Essex to enforce sterner discipline . There were even quarrels and bloodshed within the English camp itself . ' Discipline as well as reinforcements seemed absolutely necessary if the troops were to be of any use when Rouen was finally besieged . An effort was therefore made to enforce order more strictly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a further appeal to the queen for troops . On the 23rd of October Essex wrote to Burghley stating that there were but fifteen hundred able-bodied troops left and suggest-ing that one thousand new men should be made ready to be sent over on the king 's arrival before Rouen . The king also despatched a new appeal for additional troops , pioneers , ammunition and vessels . Essex , the day after his return from England , sent Sir Roger Williams to Henry and on his return ten days afterward sent him to England , so that he might declare from his own observations as well as by his instruc-tions the needs of the English army and the desperate state of the king 's finances and arms . As a matter of fact Henry 's affairs at this time , two years after his accession , seemed at the lowest possible ebb . When joined by the English ambassador as he was slowly moving toward Rouen , and pressed to declare what probability there was that he would be able to pay the English troops , he con-fessed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His treasurer acknowledged that the royal income was scarcely sufficient to pay the few garrison troops , leaving the expenses of the army in the field and of his troops drawn from Ger-many , Switzerland , Scotland and England to be paid either from the plunder or composition money of captured cities . Unton writes , " The state of France is most . miserable and lamentable , and the necessities cf the poore Kinge such as he is forced to give over his tables in coste ; and in a manner himEXPEDITION // self wanteth breadd to eate . If I were not an eywitness herof I could not believe it . . . . He is a Kinge without a crown and hee maketh warrs without money . " Most of the king 's French adherents were fighting as volunteers , at their own cost , under their own leaders , or under such governors as Henry had appointed in the various provinces of France . His own army was now principally made up of the Germans , who had only been paid for one of the three months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sullen , muti-nous and untrustworthy . They were also badly armed and attired . One of the English officers says that the English bands , miserable as they were , were " gallant in comparison of them . " Unton writes " The Kinge is followed altogether by strangers , without any number of French , who mutyne daily for wante of paie , and burne most villages where they lodge , to the great discontentment of the Kinge and greife of his good subjects , which they doe very despite-fully. " 1 Henry himself almost lost heart . One night after eleven o'clock he came to the English ambassador 's lodgings and stayed for more than an hour pouring out to him and Sir Roger Williams his despairing views of the condition of his affairs . He deplored the untrustworthiness of his French troops and the dubious attitude of the half-mutinous German mercenaries . Neither French nor Germans would do active fighting , and even the Swiss would not attack a breach , and were useful only for guard duty . He declared if he were killed he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was weary of himself , and if the queen aban-doned him he wished that death might finish his misery . The king was beginning to feel that his position and policy were hopeless . He was constantly being urged to change his faith ; he knew that a number of the cities and nobles that had taken his side , and even several members of his council , were discontented that he remained a Huguenot , and were // not giving him the military , pecuniary or moral support that he had felt he might expect . In the midst of these desperate straits , however , Henry 's winning personality still drew men 's affections and confi-dence . The English ambassador was not an enthusiast ; Henry in fact thought him not a very favorable advocate of his cause . Yet he testified of the king in one of his reports at this time that " he is a most noble , brave King ; of great patience and magnanymitie ; not ceremonious , affable , familiar , and only followed for his treu vallour ; but very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to forsake him if he converte not . " All who came in contact with him felt his charm . Many Englishmen who had never known him and who looked at his affairs with but little per-sonal interest were none the less impressed with the bold fight he was making , and with the desirability of supporting his cause . ' Therefore when Sir Roger Williams arrived in England on the last day of October , and presented to the privy council the request of the king and the general for reinforcements , he had no difficulty in winning its approval . That of the queen was a different matter , and for a while no one ventured to stir her wrath by placing the matter before her . Yet the knowledge that Henry 's army was so near revolt and dis-solution , that Parma was preparing to enter France from the Netherlands with a new army for the assistance of the League , that additional Spanish troops were being prepared for Brittany ; the probability of the complete domination of Spain in France , and in the background the constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force Elizabeth to a policy of further sup-port of the king . That part of the condition of affairs which had to do with the armies was placed in plain terms before her by Williams , and on November 15th he had the satis-faction of taking back news that she had consented to the despatch of a000 veteran troops which should be withdrawn // from the Netherlands and to the levy of 450 sappers and miners in Cornwall , all to be sent immediately to Normandy . These arrived in due time at Dieppe under the charge of Sir Edmund Yorke , the 400 pioneers and 50 miners from Eng-land about December 1st , the companies from the Nether-lands , quietly withdrawn without consulting the estates , by way of Flushing , December 7th . But such reinforcements were less important than might at first appear . The differ-ence between nominal and actual numbers is a constant characteristic of this period . There were supposed to be in this contingent from the Netherlands seven companies of 150 men each , making with their officers a total of 1 roo men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English force in Normandy shortly afterward consisted of but 1089 soldiers and 198 officers . ' In the meantime the siege of Rouen had actually begun . The king , it is true , still delayed . More than two months had elapsed since the conference at Noyon ; but it was certain now that he was approaching ; the towns flanking Rouen had been captured ; and there was no reason why the actual arrival of the king should be awaited . On the 27th of Octo-ber therefore the English army left its camp at Arques , Met the French at Cally , and on the 29th Biron and Essex occupied the suburbs of the city . The English occupied the village of Mont de Malade , a little hill to the northwest of the city only a quarter of a mile from the town walls . Various detachments of the French and Swiss established themselves in other suburbs . In the skirmishing connected with the investment of the city , the English won much credit and received a letter of praise and acknowledgment from the queen . Two weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the outlying fort of St. Kath-erine which he considered the most important point to cap-ture . But the progress of the siege was disappointing . // Villars , governor of the town for the League , was a brave , skilful and energetic commander . He had made careful preparations and utilized the advantages of his position to the utmost . The city had been so well victualled that there was very little suffering until quite at the close of the siege , and not a single person died of famine . Many of the horses and cows had to be killed for lack of forage , but these served for a while at least as food for the populace . The allied army carried on vigorously the work of trenching and bombarded the defences of the city from several points , but they were not strong enough to overcome its defenders . Their marks-manship does not seem to have been of the best , as a French officer who was in the town at the time testifies that more than four thousand musket and arquebus shots were dis-charged at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single one of the inhabitants being killed or wounded.l Even when some English and Dutch boats made their way up the Seine with men and munitions nothing more was accom-plished . Week after week , and indeed month after month , passed away in a constant series of petty skirmishes , sorties and attempts at ambuscades . Occasionally a few men were killed on one side or the other , occasionally an unusually furious sortie was made , and the trenches were gradually pushed closer and closer to the city walls . The earl , the marshal and the king met almost daily for conference or companionship , and the monotony was varied by occasional dinner or hunting parties . Captain Coningsby , who has left us his journal of the siege , showed still more enterprise in seeking amusement . " This afternoone , to drive awaie idle-ness , I went to a monasterie of nonnes , about a league and a half from our quarters , where we so behaved ourselves that we receyved very kynd wellcomes , and a banckett of twenty-one severall dishes of preserved fruits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three howres there , returned home to our strawe bed . " But usually the occupations were guarding , foraging , // entrenching and fighting , and the relaxations watching a skirmish " handled verie soldior-lyke on both sides , " or " the beste fighte that I sawe betwixt them since our arryvall , for there were blowes both with the sword and pystoll , blood on both sides , horses slayne , and one of our French taken pris-oner , " or " many a horse well spurred , and many a sword jollyly glystering in the sunn on both sides , " or seeing the king ride down from a hill top into the midst of a melee " like god Mars his thunderbolt . " These skirmishes used up men , camp fever broke out , and there was some friction between the various nations in the allied quarters . The German auxiliaries were still unpaid and it required skilful encouragement from both the English and the French officers , and two personal letters from the queen to the prince of Anhalt , their commander , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in November , after the siege had been in progress about a month , a message came from England that sent the general homeward for a second hasty visit to the queen . It was the anticipation and desire of others beside the queen that he would not return to France . He had won the admira-tion and affection of his followers by his constant activity , his bravery and his amiable manner , but it can not be said that he had shown any special gifts of generalship . Moreover , the campaign of 1591 was practically over . The siege was dragging on with small prospect of success , Leighton and Killigrew as well as Essex were absent from the army , the approach of Parma 's army so long threatened would certainly not be long delayed , and the most that could be hoped was that Henry 's army should be held together till his enemies were wearied out and the resistance to him gradually extin-guished . Such fiery spirits as Essex and such optimistic souls as Henry himself still hoped that the goddess of chance might throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to more conservative men , even those who cared most for Essex , he seemed to be doing both himself and // the king an injury . By his chivalrous sympathy he was misleading Henry into the mistaken belief that Elizabeth would do something more for him , and at the same time diminishing his own fair credit and reputation by the leader-ship of such a forlorn hope . But Essex had given his promise to Henry to return , he felt that his honor forbade him to desert the siege while the duke of Parma was approaching , so he pleaded successfully with the queen for permission to rejoin his troops . On the loth of December therefore he was again at Dieppe and on the 14th in the camp before Rouen . ' In accordance with the strict instructions of the queen , Essex proceeded reluctantly to reorganize his little army on a smaller scale . The number of men in each company was reduced from one hundred and fifty to one hundred , and only as many companies were retained as could be made full in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This process left but eight companies , numbering with their officers less than a thousand men , out of the whole original force of twenty-five companies and their reinforce-ments . Henry still sent appeals to the queen directly and through both Unton and Essex for five thousand or more new men to help him continue the siege and withstand Parma when he should arrive , but the ambassador declined to trans-mit any more such requests , and Essex simply mentioned t hem in his letters without anticipation of a favorable reply . In January Duplessis was sent from Henry to the queen on a special mission for the same purpose . But sharp refusals and angry reproaches were the only replies from the queen to letters and personal solicitations alike and January 2nd , she issued a public declaration giving her reasons for refusing to send any more troops to France and protesting against the pressure being brought on her to do so.2 // Even Essex at last realized that there was no hope of actual victory ; and although he and his little group of men still took part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls of Rouen , they realized that it was rather in defence of honor and protraction of time than in anticipa-tion of success . As he had done in Portugal , Essex tried to transform a modern war into a medieval tournament . He offered to fight with Villars , the governor of Rouen , singly or with twenty or with sixty men on each side , for the main-tenance of the claim , " That the king 's quarrel is juster than the League 's , that I am a better man than yourself , and that my mistress is fairer than yours . " Unfortunately the days of chivalry were over , these three dubious questions could hardly be settled in single combat , and it is not at all certain that a settlement of any or all of them would have contributed largely to bringing the war to an end . Essex obtained no more satisfaction than a rebuff from Villars and a scolding from the queen . It is only fair to Essex , however , to say that somewhat less formal challenging across the narrow strip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common occurrence , and the frequent conflicts not to be very clearly distinguished from duels . ' A letter from a group of the privy councillors , on the 19th of December , urged Essex for his own credit to return from what was now such an unworthy command . A some-what sarcastic letter from the queen on the 23rd ordered him to send home any remaining " gentlemen of good qual-ity dear to their parents and their blood , " and gave him permission either to remain as long as one man was left or to return as soon as his own judgment was good enough to show him its wisdom . All his best friends urged his recall . Henry himself , at Unton 's request , advised Essex to withdraw . The queen finally sent a personal letter to him with peremp-tory orders to return , but enclosed it in despatches from Cecil to Unton , with orders to the ambassador not to deliver // it if the earl should make an early decision to return volun-tarily . Essex , however , was present when Unton opened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it away , and opened and read it before Unton could stop him . He had now no choice and on the 8th of January , 1592 , after a hasty visit to the king in his camp , and a protest against leaving when a battle was in prospect , handed over his com-mand to Sir Roger Williams , kissed his sword as he sailed out of the harbor of Dieppe , and returned discontented to England . He resumed his attendance at court January 15th , and turned his restless mind for the time from military to diplomatic ambitions . It was six weeks later that Norris returned from Brittany . ' CHAPTER XIV THE BRITTANY AND NETHERLANDS CAMPAIGNS OF 1592 ? 5 THREE alternatives were now before the queen ; to with-draw her two little armies , sadly decayed as they were , from France ; to combine them into one force for the protec-tion of either Brittany or Normandy ; or , finally , in accord-ance with the continued urgency of Henry and most of her councillors , to reinforce them . It was the last to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , irresolution and delay . Now that her favorite was at home she was more willing to add to the forces abroad . Essex and the French ambassador were both able to write to Henry that the queen had assured them of her intention to despatch one or two thousand men to Normandy immediately . In fact the orders for their levy were actually made out ; but the queen refused to sign them . In March the sent Sir Thomas Wilkes over to Henry 's camp with instructions to make secret inquiries as to the likelihood of the king 's ultimate success and the sin-cerity of his promises . Elizabeth feared that he might at any time make a peace with his rebellious subjects or with the king of Spain adverse to her interests . Even after Wilkes ' report she remained in suspense . A plan momentarily won favor for sending Sir Roger Williams , with the troops now lying at Rouen , overland to Brittany . Plans for send-ing Sir John Norris back with strengthened forces and new instructions were also considered . ' After some weeks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A handful of men were despatched to Brittany , and twelve companies , making up some i600 // men , arrived at Dieppe under Sir Edmund Yorke , an offi-cer who had been in France before and had made a repu-tation for his skill in fortification . On the 27th of March , 1592 , they joined the little remnant of their countrymen and the king 's forces before Rouen . But they were too late . Even this addition to Henry 's forces , and a body of Dutch troops which arrived under Count Maurice of Nassau on the loth of April , could not hold the position before Rouen against external attack . The duke of Parma with an army of 12,000 foot and 4000 horse , pressing steadily if slowly on , arrived early in April within four leagues of the city . On the loth a sudden advance by this relieving force on the French king and his allies in their camp and a wild night of fighting in the entrench-ments broke up the siege of Rouen which had now endured more than six months and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Henry was not able to prevent Parma from entering the city and providing it with supplies and fresh defenders . Nor had the king force enough both to meet Parma in the field and at the same time to keep up his investment of the city . He therefore reluctantly raised the siege , formed his troops , including the English , into a movable army and began the pursuit of Parma 's army , which had departed as soon as it had revictualled Rouen and disorganized the siege . Parma marched some distance to the west and recaptured Caudebec and some smaller towns , but his work was accomplished , and as his army was in no condition to remain in France he almost immediately began his retreat . ' In the skirmishes at the raising of the siege , in the battle of Yvetot which followed , and in the fighting of the next few weeks , in which the army of Parma , weakened by famine , disease and contention , was gradually driven by Henry back into Flanders , the English troops were actively engaged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed by their captains to leave the army . The old disgrace of deser-tion asserted itself anew , but few of the deserters reached home . Now that the army was further from the coast such deserters formed themselves into bands sometimes of as many as twenty or thirty , and in the effort to make their way to England were frequently overtaken by the enemy or the French peasants and had their throats cut to a man . By May the English bands were reduced to eight hundred , and these were in bad condition . By order of the queen they were again reformed , nineteen broken companies giving place to eight full ones . An effort was made again to reinforce them by detaching two thousand men from the English garrison in the Low Countries , but this plan met with such deter-mined resistance there that it was given up . Again it was proposed to send them overland to join the force in Brittany , but this plan also was abandoned .

On the twelfth of June , 1592 , the remnant of the English troops were given permission by the king to return to Dieppe for a rest of twenty days , and their commander , Sir Roger Williams , went on a visit to England . At about the same time Sir Henry Unton , the ambassador who had gone over to France with Essex in August , 1591 , whose tact and endurance had been so sorely tried during the last ten months , and whose voluminous correspondence throws such a clear light on the events of that period , was given permission to return to England , which he reached on the 17th of June . The second expedition to Normandy , like the expedition to Brit-tany , was evidently a thing of the past , though the little body of troops still lay encamped at Dieppe , and even occasionally gave some help to the king in his fighting .
