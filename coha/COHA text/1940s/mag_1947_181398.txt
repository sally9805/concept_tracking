Gathering up his notes and books , he tucked his hornrimmed spectacles into the pocket of his tweed jacket and picked up his mortarboard . Still talking-to the accompaniment of occasional appreciative laughs and squeals from his audience-he leaned over to return the watch he had borrowed from a student in the front row . As he ended his final sentence , he stepped off the platform . <P> The maneuver gained him a head start on the rush of students down the center aisle . Once in the street , he strode rapidly - his black gown billowing behind his grey flannel trousers-to the nearest pub for a pint of ale . <P> Clive Staples Lewis was engaged in his full-time and favorite job-the job of being an Oxford don in the Honour School of English Language &; Literature , a Fellow and tutor of Magdalen College and the most popular lecturer in the University .
