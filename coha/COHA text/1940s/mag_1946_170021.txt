A tight-lipped businessman named Albert Houston from Chatham , Ont. had tramped from farm to farm buying used tractors . When he had 69 , he slapped on some fresh paint , took them to Yorkton , Sask . In newspapers and on telephone-pole posters he advertised a " Mammoth Auction Sale of Farm Machinery . " Not until the day before the auction did Yorkton 's 5,577 people know what they were in for . Some 10,000 tractor-hungry farmers , their pockets bulging with cash , arrived from all over the prairies . When all the rooms in Yorkton 's three hotels were snapped up , empty cells in the jail were used . Private citizens rented their spare rooms , put four farmers in a bed . But hundreds of the invaders had to sleep in their cars , or nowhere . Cars were so jammed in one Yorkton street , that firemen had to detour to reach a fire . <P> Government liquor-store operators sold a 26-oz. crock of gin , rum or wine every 27 seconds from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m . Beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses in a day . Because many a farmer had left his meat ration coupons home , grocers had a field day . Said one : " I sold more bananas and sardines than I 'll ever sell again one day if I stay in business 100 years . " <P> Next day , at the auction , the urge to splurge was even giddier . Reason : no ceiling prices on used machinery . A 1938 McCormick-Deering tractor , which cost $1,300 , was knocked down at $2,100 . A Cockshutt tractor ( $1,341 new ) went for $1,775 . Twelve-year-old Olivers ( $1,740 new ) brought $1,875 . One farmer got one for $1,800 , sold it a moment later to an unsuccessful bidder for $1,900 , thought the deal over , bought it back for $2,000 . Another farmer , who had sold Houston one of his own used machines , liked the new paint job so well that he bid $300 more for it than he had been paid . He was out bid . The crowd 's enthusiasm even infected the three auctioneers . One got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . <P> At sale 's end , Albert Houston ( who would not say what he had paid for the 69 tractors in the first place ) pocketed an estimated $137,000 and departed .
