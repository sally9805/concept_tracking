The giving mood Russia has shown in Paris ( see above ) spread to The Bronx just in time to save the Security Council from another awkward split . <P> Ten of the eleven nations at the horseshoe table , including the three ( France , Mexico , Poland ) which had originally backed Russia 's demand for immediate U.N . action against Franco , supported Australia 's proposal for a five-man subcommittee to sift the facts on Spain and suggest by May 31 what " practical measures " U.N . could take . Andrei Gromyko said he " intensely disagreed " but would abstain , " realizing that my vote against the proposal would make its adoption impossible . " Gromyko thus reiterated Russia 's sweeping interpretation of the veto . Earlier , Russia had threatened another walkout from U.N . After the Council voted down 8-to-3 his demand that it drop Iran from the agenda , Gromyko said that Russia would take no further part in the discussions on Iran . Everybody had won-Russia most of all .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
