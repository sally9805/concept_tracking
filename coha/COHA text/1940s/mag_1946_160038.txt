Commercial aviation 's first big labor crisis ( TIME , Oct. 28 ) was more exasperating than an adolescent quarrel . Transcontinental &; Western Air , Inc. , third largest U.S. airline , continued to thrash about on the ground last week with its striking pilots ' union . Neither gawky T.W.A. nor the Air Line Pilots Association , the Little Lord Fauntleroy of the A.F.L. , wanted to be first in hollering uncle . <P> A.L.P.A. President David Behncke stuck stubbornly to his wage demands . The pilots were asking four-figured annual salary increases for flying the bigger payloads of trickier , four-motored transports . T.W.A. 's President Jack Frye stood equally firm . Overseas expansion and expensive troubles with the Lockheed Constellation ( TIME , July 22 ) had already stretched <P> T.W.A. resources thin . Frye claimed that the thread would snap under a heftier payroll . He asked the Government to take over and keep the cash register ringing . <P> In Washington , Chairman Frank Douglass of the National Mediation Board knocked heads together . But days of private confabbing failed to spin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly 15,000 employes ( worldwide* ) and broadly hinted that the highly paid pilots were taking bread out of the mouths of lower-paid mechanics , clerks , stewardesses , et al . Many of those locked out took the hint and picketed pilots ' homes ( see cut ) . <P> First &; Only . But brash tactics did not unnerve slow-talking Dave Behncke . A onetime stunt flyer in the days when bamboo and baling wire passed for an airplane , he was prepared to sweat out the storm . It had been building up since he quit United Air Lines eleven years ago to become A.L.P.A. 's first and only fulltime president ( salary : $12,000 ) . <P> He had fought vigorously to tighten safety regulations and had developed a tight organization for the highly skilled specialists , whose careers are abruptly over the day they fail a physical . Today all but a handful of pilots among the major airlines pay A.L.P.A. 's initiation fee ( up to $100 ) and dues ( up to $100 yearly ) . <P> Soon after V-J day Behncke had stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bigger , faster planes of the postwar era . Pay rates-computed on a complicated formula covering mileage , speed , and hours in the air - had not been basically revised since a 1934 decision of the National Labor <P> Board . Weather delays and scheduled stopovers often kept pilots from logging maximum flight earnings . Behncke turned down a compromise suggested by a presidential factfinding board last July , held out for the equally unwieldy principle that each new design off the drafting board demanded a new formula . <P> Scanning the dispute , C.I.O. President Phil Murray called it " a row between capitalists . " T.W.A. was finding out that capitalists , too , could be tough . <P> <P> - In Paris , T.W.A. 's 200 employes fared better . Under regulations of the French Ministry of Labor , a full month 's notice must precede a layoff . T.W.A. 's Paris branch still remained on the payroll .
