txt WASHINGTON , July 18 ? President Roosevelt revealed today that he intended to send a special message to Congress next week supporting the Army 's urgent appeal for legislation to retain selectees , National Guardsmen and reserve officers in military service for the duration of the emergency . Hope immediately sprang up among some Administration fol. ; lowers at the Capitol that the President would thus take the lead in having Congress declare formally a state of national peril so that statutory provisions for holding the temporary soldiers in camp might automatically come into force and the whole preparedness drive may be put on a more warlike footing . However , there was little in the President 's announcement , made at his regular press conference , to indicate that he would ask Congress outright for a declaration of a state of emergency to buttress the proclamation which he issued on the night of May 27 . He simply said that the message would be general in nature and that the legislative method for holding the selectees , guardsmen and reservists in service would be left to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be satisfied with either of two courses : first , a declaration of emergency by Congress or , secondly , passage of new legislation empowering him to extend the service tenure of any soldier , regular or temporary , until the end of the emergency as proclaimed by him in May . As seen here the matter of declaring emergencies is divided between the President and Congress . By ' his proclamation nearly two months ago , the President brought into force some laws dealing largely with the conduct of civilian affairs . A Congressional declaration of emergency would set in.motion acts dealing more directly with military actions , and would specifically vitalize sections of the Selective Service Act , the National Guard Act and the National Defense Act which empower the President to prolong the service of trainees , guardsmen and reserve officers in event of just such a declaration . Other Army officers and civilians interested in the armed forces went before the Senate Military Affairs Committee today to urge Congress to use the simplest method , and declare a national emergency . They backed up in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chief of Staff of the Army ; also his estimates as to the seriousness to the ' United States of the present international situation . Generals Ask Emergency Call Those urging the emergency call included Major Gen. Jacob L. Devers , commander of the Ninth Division at Fort Bragg , N. C. ; Major Gen. Milton A. Reckord , who rose through the National Guard of Maryland to his present post as commanding officer of the TwentyNinth Division at Fort Meade ; Major Gen. William H. Haskell , commander of the Twenty-seventh Division , made up of about " 60-40 " of New York National Guardsmen and selectees ; Major Gen. John F. Williams , chief of the National Guard Bureau ; Brig . Gen. Charles H. Grahl , Adjutant General of Iowa and president of the National Adjutant Generals Association ; Major Gen. George E. Leech , retired , vice president of the Na tional Guard Association , and Colonel John Thomas Taylor , legislative representative of the American Legion . Following them on the stand was Norman Thomas , Socialist leader and first witness to oppose the service-extension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's name , his plans for the Army and his opinions " are being used in a great game of politics , the logical end of which is war , which 70 or possibly 80 per cent of the American people do not want . " General Devers , who is soon to be transferred from his post as head of the Ninth Division to the command of the armored forces , urged immediate enactment of the service-extension legislation to prevent the disintegration of the unit he has been building up for the last several months . He told the committee that the Ninth Division would be a firstclass , efficient fighting unit by Jan. 1 if its present organization was continued . But , he added , if its selectees are demobilized in January , as they will have to be under existing law , it will be another eight months before replacements can be trained properly and the division restored to its prospective Jan. 1 level . " Chaos " for 27th Is Pictured General Haskell predicted " chaos " for the Twenty-seventh Division , now encamped at Fort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold the trainees and Guardsmen in service . " If something is n't done , we will have to let about 11,000 National Guard troops go in October at the end of their training period of one year , " said General Haskell . " Then we would have nothing left but 7,000 trainees . In February they would have to go out ; then we would have practically nothing left . " Why , there would be chaos . What there would be left of the outfit would n't be able to move from one town to another , to- say nothing of being able to fight . The men themselves would think the country had gone crazy to let them go . " General T-Taskell urged the committee to recommend a declaration of emergency to Congress . The troops in the field are not all psychologically " in line , " he said , because the " boys down in the . country " do n't understand the seriousness of the situation . He predicted that if Congress declared a state of national peril , 98 per cent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the thing through . " ' He did not propose , however , that a system of volunteering be instituted for re-enlistment of the Guard . General Rockford challenged any suggestion that there was an implied " contract " to muster out the National Guardsmen at the end of a year 's training . The real contract which Guardsmen made when they enlisted , he said , was to serve their State and national governments in any emergency " for the duration . " " Does that feeling run throughout the enlisted personnel ? " Senator Stiles Bridges , Republican , of New Hampshire , asked . " With at least 90 per cent of , them , I think it 's true , " said General Reckord . Emergency There , Said Witness In answer to questions from Senator Josh Lee , Democrat , of Oklahoma , General Reckord said he thought a real emergency now existed and would be materially increased if the Nazi forces overran Russia . General Williams urged the committee to recommend legislation to keep the present forces intact , and insisted most of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70,000 National Guardsmen were scheduled to be sent home eight weeks hence unless legislation to the contrary is enacted , and they wanted to make their personal arrangements one way or the other . He warned the committee not to expect the Guardsmen to stay in their units back home once they are mustered out . " They will be moving to the industrial centers to try to make some money , " he said . " They wo n't want to give any more of their time to the National Guard . " General Grahl testified that the Guardsmen would be willing and anxious to stay in service if they knew that an emergency existed . General Leech contended that it would be a death blow to the whole . National Guard organization if it is relieved from service at any time before the emergency is over . " The . National Guard never has considered itself as anything but a combat force that would be the first to- get into line and the last to leave , " he said . Legion Backs Retention Colonel Taylor ' put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep the selectees , Guardsmen and reservists in service . He urged , however , that Congress recognize and proclaim by its own ' action the present state of national emergency . " Any man , who closes his eyes and denies this emergency exists , is a foolish man , " said Colonel Taylor . Senator Downey of California , a member of the Military Affairs Committee , stated as the committee opened today ' ' s session that he would propose an amendment to the service-extension legislation , giving each selectee $30 additional pay for each month he is retained in the Army after his first year . He said his amendment would also create a joint Congressional committee to investigate means of reemploying the selectees in civilian life when they finally leave the armed forces . Mr. Downey called his plan " a rehabilitation program " and said it would ease the transition period which selectees will have to go through when they return to normal pursuits , and would also support the nation 's purchasing power when emergency defense spending is shut off .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
