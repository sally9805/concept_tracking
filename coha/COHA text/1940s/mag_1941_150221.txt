Pretended Portraiture <P> Sirs : <P> What , a Bunyan on the Achilles heel of TIME ? Your supposed portrait of John Milton ( TIME , March 17 ) is believed by authorities ( J. F. Marsh , G. C. Williamson , et al. ) to be actually of John Bunyan , the author of Pilgrim 's Progress . Your cut showed but part of the picture ; a staff and pilgrim 's bottle are really in the left background , and what appears to be a representation of the risen Savior is in the upper right . The portrait belonged to Capel Lofft , who believing it to be of Milton , published an engraving of it in 1792 . Lofft , like TIME , was evidently unaware of the authentic Faithorne engraving , which is the National Portrait Gallery 's choice among portraits of Milton , although Lofft presented the Gallery with his pretended portrait in 1839 . Experts acquainted with the various portraits of Milton and Bunyan will hardly approve your selection ; and Milton himself might say of it what he said of Marshall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know my face , <P> Fail to find me in this place . <P> Portraiture the fool pretends ; <P> Laugh at the result , my friends . <P> On the other hand , I salute your reviewer for his wise , penetrating account of Logan Pearsall Smith 's Milton and His Modern Critics . . . . <P> WILLIAM R. PARKER Department of English The Ohio State University Columbus , Ohio <P> " Those Horrid Books " <P> Sirs : <P> Although I am one of this thoughtless generation ( 13 ) , I generally read TIME . In the Feb. 24 issue I came across your brilliant ( oh , yeah ! ) expose of comic books . I was amazed : " An overseasoned , indigestible , nerve-shattering , eye-ruining diet of non-comic murder , torture , kidnappings , sex-baiting . " Brother , do n't make us laugh ! . . . <P> This is a little bewildering to me . We 're reading those horrid books , but are they more horrid than the world where people are killing each other ? In the U. S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe I speak for every " real " boy and girl in the U. S. when I say : " Quit getting grey hairs worrying about us and see what can be done about the world we 're growing up in . " <P> MARCIA RAHN Billings , Mont . <P> Forces of Evil <P> Sirs : <P> . . . Have read the letter from Mary Rohrabaugh of Youngstown that says , " I hate war " TIME , March 10 . Who does n't ? Lincoln , too , hated war , so did Washington , so does all the civilized Christian world ; but the time to cry out against it is past when the evil forces in the world make it inevitable . Lincoln and Washington mourned the sacrifice of the youth of our land to war in their day , but they had no choice . . . . <P> These are not easy times for youth ; but looking back through history was there ever an easy time ? Each generation has its problems to face . Do you want this one to throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BETTY Fox Boston , Mass . <P> Sirs : <P> I like TIME . I wish that TIME would refrain from using the term " isolationist . " No one in the U. S. is one . We all realize that the world is constantly growing smaller .
