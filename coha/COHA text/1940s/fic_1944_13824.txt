The inner courtyard of an old house in Mexico City . The house is a dilapidated but beautiful relic of colonial times , now a lodging-house , shabby but decent . Most of the rooms of the house open into this courtyard which is in two stories with a narrow balcony running along two sides - the back and the left . This balcony is supported by narrow columns . Down left is a curved staircase leading up to the balcony . Upper right a dark corridor ( zaguan ) leading to the street . There is a heavy old carved wooden door here , with a tiny peep-hole where one can look out before opening . The door is held closed by a strong old wooden bar . Down right a corridor leading to the kitchen patio . Center a small fountain with a low stonewall around it where people can sit . Back center - Miguel O'Higgins ' room . Up left - Evelyn 's room . Down left - by the staircase - Gilda 's room . On the balcony - the doors to Tony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rises , HERCULANO and LUPE are on stage . Herculano is an old Mexican servant , stupid , harmless , habitually sodden with pulque . His job is pottering around and now watching the outer door . He is sitting inside the zaguan barely seen in the shadows . He is dozing . Under the balcony at the back beside the door to O'Higgins ' room is Lupe . She is a beautiful young Indian woman . She sits on the stones on a bright blanket , has a few little pottery dishes around her and a little charcoal stove . She is patting tortillas . In a big pot is something cooking . The time is around midday . It is quiet . There is the sound of loud hammering on the outer door . Herculano rouses - looks out the peep-hole - opens the door . Enter EVELYN . Mrs. Evelyn Hoag is a small-town American woman around forty , who has left her good commonplace husband at home in a good commonplace bungalow to come to Mexico to " study . " She is interested in native " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her artistic yearning in a young Mexican singer called Prudencio . She is common and silly and vain , and shows it in everything about her ; but she is sure of her superiority , and aggressive about it . She is irritated by being made to wait and comes on innerly spoiling for a fight . MRS . HOAG ( comes into the patio from the zaguan - calls ) Prudie  --  Prudie  --  ( turns back - disappointed and angry - calls ) Herculano ! p. 3 HERCULANO ( appears from withint the zaguan ) Yes , Mrs. Evelyn ? MRS . HOAG Senor Prudencio has n't come yet ? HERCULANO ( stupidly ) Who ? LUPE ( looking up from her tortillas - with a little wise smile ) Prudencio . HERCULANO Oh . No , Mrs. Evelyn - he has n't come . MRS . HOAG I 'm sure he came  --  and you did n't let him in ! Stupid ! I bet you do n't even know who I mean . HERCULANO Oh yes - you mean the boy you give money to - to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! - I 'm going to - ( stops - makes a gesture dismissing it ) Oh you 're so full of booze you 're not responsible - so drunk all the time you do n't know anything !

It 's never later than  --  HERCULANO He came but he went by . p. 4 MRS . HOAG Because you would n't let him in ! I know he had a letter for me ! - with a check in it ! My husband never fails to send my check on the first . It 's already way past ! I  --  LUPE Maybe he 's got another woman . MRS . HOAG No ! The letter came . I am sure it came and  --  Enter down right , SINFOROSA , a Mexican woman around fifty , never married . She is dark , thin , always dressed in black . She comes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the outer door , throwing a black veil over her head as she comes . She is nervous , hurried and timid . She comes rapidly like a person who is just snatching at a free moment . MRS . HOAG ( turning to her - peremptorily ) Senorita ! SINFOROSA ( caught - unable to escape - turns back - patiently ) Yes , Mrs. Evelyn ? MRS . HOAG How long are you going to have this old drunk guarding the door ? SINFOROSA Who knows ? MRS . HOAG Who knows - always - who knows . Do n't you know ? You own the house . You 're the boss . You 're  --  SINFOROSA ( deprecating ) The Senora Cristina asked for a watchman . She pays Herculano extra . I have nothing to say about it . p. 5 MRS . HOAG It 's all nonsense - a watchman on the door . For what ? Does she think  --  SINFOROSA ( dignified ) The life of her son is threatened , Mrs. Evelyn . MRS . HOAG Boo ! SINFOROSA ( with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - just one week ago . You know that as well as  --  MRS . HOAG I know there was some shooting going on . That 's nothing ! That happens every day down here . Why should she think it was at Tony ? SINFOROSA ( patiently ) He was just going out the door , Mrs. Evelyn . MRS . HOAG And does she think the murderer now is going to walk in and  --  SINFOROSA Who knows ? Her son does not leave the house now . Who knows  --  MRS . HOAG She 's just neurotic about the boy ! All this exaggerated mother-love - it 's her repressed libido ! The other tenants have some rights . That their friends - and their letters - come in is just as important as her murderers stay out ! SINFOROSA ( anxious ) But it 's only for a day or two , Mrs. Evelyn ! They are leaving . They are going to the United States . The Senora Cristina is at the Consulate now to get their visas . p. 6 MRS . HOAG Then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! SINFOROSA Why not ? They are fine honorable people - they  --  MRS . HOAG Because they have n't any money ! - they have n't anything ! We do n't want people like that anymore . We have enough of them ! ( as Sinforosa starts for the door ) Do n't run away ! You 've got to face this ! SINFOROSA ( drawing her veil over her head again ) I was just going out to pray to Saint Anthony to  --  MRS . HOAG All this praying all the time . It 's neurotic ! It 's a transference of your repressed libido ! - praying for every door - for every  --  SINFOROSA ( overwhelmed ) It is n't only the door , Mrs. Evelyn ! - it 's a chicken ! A chicken has been stolen - a fine , fat chicken - right out of the pot ! - right  --  MRS . HOAG ( suddenly ) My chicken ? SINFOROSA Who knows ? MRS . HOAG Yes ! My chicken that I bought for Prudencio 's lunch . That - ( sniffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ) Chicken , huh ? p. 7 LUPE ( on the defensive ) My chicken . MRS . HOAG My chicken ! Give it to me ! ( tries to take the pot from the protesting Lupe - it is hot ) Ouch  --  ( Lupe laughs ) Give me my chicken - you thief ! You  --  SINFOROSA ( intervening ) Wait ! Wait ! I 'll tell the gentleman . He does n't like a thief . ( to Lupe ) Where is he ? LUPE He has gone out . ( O'Higgins ' voice comes from the other side of the door - he is singing an Irish song in a loud voice ) SINFOROSA ( knocking on door - the song is silent ) Senor ! MRS . HOAG Let me ! ( starts to open the door ) LUPE He 's lying on the bed naked . ( Evelyn drops the handle ) Go in if you want - he wo n't care . ( Evelyn takes hold of the handle again ) SINFOROSA ( dignified ) We observe the decencies here , Mrs. Evelyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence ) Senor ! The woman is stealing again . p. 8 O'HIGGINS ( off ) Stealing ? SINFOROSA Yes -- stealing ! O'HIGGINS ( off ) ( roaring ) Wait til I come out ! Sinforosa backs away Lupe gets up quickly runs to Zaguan . DANIEL O'HIGGINS comes on.He is a powerful interesting looking man in his forties . He is a painter , an artist of originality and power , but unrecognized . He is an American -- but has lived many years in Europe -- mostly in France and Spain . He has come to Mexico- fed up with the overcivilization and decadence of Europe --  seeking salvation in primitiveness , - the Indian . In character he is honest , generous , independent , sensitive , and strong . His manners reflect this . He can be protective , tender , caressing ,  --  and abrupt , rude , frankly insulting , - depending on circumstances and the person he is with . He has been in this house only a few weeks --  coming to the city from the back country- with Lupe- to enter his picture in a big government-sponsored contest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now he waits for the decision -- financially broke -- undecided about his future . O'HIGGINS Where is the thief ? ( see Lupe in the Zaguan -- drags her out ) Stealing again , eh ? By God I am going to make you honest if I have to --  what did you take this time ? p. 9 SINFOROSA A chicken . MRS . HOAG ( coming into it ) My chicken ! O'HIGGINS ( in a different tone that shows his deslike ) Your chicken ? MRS . HOAG Yes ! A fat young chicken . O'HIGGINS ( letting Lupe go ) A fat , young chicken , huh ? Where is it ? LUPE ( reassured , goes to the pot , lifts it under his face , so that he can smell its delicious fragrance - then to Evelyn ) Prove it ! Prove it ! O'HIGGINS Yes . How do you know this is your chicken ? This is our chicken , from the market . I bought it myself . MRS . HOAG ( sarcastio ) With what ? O'HIGGINS ( struck ) With what ? MRS . HOAG Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen you eat anything but tortillas . LUPE With chili - with chili ! MRS . HOAG ( mocking ) Yes ! with chili . ( taunting ) What did you buy my chicken with ? p. 10 LUPE ( as O'Higgins makes no answer ) He gave a picture ! O'HIGGINS No ! No picture for a chicken ! MRS . HOAG How - then ? O'HIGGINS I won it in a raffle . ( Lupe hands him a piece of chicken - he bites into it with relish ) Delicious ! Take some , Lupe . Give Herculano some ! ( calling ) Herculano ! MRS . HOAG ( almost in tears ) My chicken ! LUPE ( triumphant ) Prove it ! O'HIGGINS ( eating ) Yes , you ca n't prove this is your chicken . But I can prove it is n't . This chicken is young . This chicken has juice and flavor . If it were your chicken it would be old and tough - no flavor - no  --  ( to Lupe as Herculano draws near ) Give Herculano a piece . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodding gratefully ) Thank you , Senor . ( takes his chicken - eats ) MRS . HOAG ( beside herself ) Give me my chicken ! Give me  --  There is knocking on the door . Herculano , eating , hurries to open it . Enter through zaguan , CRISTINA . Cristina de Mora is a slender , graceful woman about 38 or 40 years old - a European , born in the north of Spain , fair of skin and with ash-blond hair . Not pretty in a conventional way , but with an air of great personal distinction . She has the allure of a very feminine woman , sensitive and highly cultivated . She wears simple , becoming but rather shabby street clothes . She comes on hurriedly . p. 11 MORA Oh , Herculano , you 've left the door ! ( calls to the upper balcony anxiously ) Tony ! Tony ! ( more anxiously - turning back to Herculano ) Has anything happened ? Has he gone out ? HERCULANO ( disappearing into the zaguan ) Nothing . He 's here . TONY appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is a boy - not yet twenty - handsome , intelligent and good , but there is a heightened sensibility and insecurity about him of those who have lived through too much too young . MORA ( smoothing his hair as one who has been lying down ) You want me , Mother ? MORA ( turning - relieved ) Oh , Tony , I did n't hear the typewriter . I thought you had broken your promise and gone out . MORA ( a bit impatiently ) No - no . I 've been working . I just got tired . I guess I dozed a little . Is there anything wrong with that ? MORA ( soothing ) No , dear ! Of course you have a right to rest , only - MORA Only what ? MORA You sleep so much in the day now , darling , that is why you ca n't rest at night . p. 12 MORA It 's the other way around . I ca n't rest at night so I sleep in the day ! Well - did you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - not yet - but I will . I have n't given up - I - MORA ( he is relieved ) That 's all right , Mother . We 'll stay here . ( he turns back toward his room ) MORA ( quickly ) No - we will not stay here ! MORA ( more impatient ) I want to stay here ! MRS . HOAG ( jeering ) We know why , Tony ! ( Tony makes an angry gesture - goes into his room . Cristina starts to the stairs . ) MRS . HOAG You did n't get your visas then , senora Cristina ? MORA Not yet - - - MRS . HOAG How long do you expect to keep Herculano sitting at the door ? It 's a great inconvenience to all the rest of us and - MORA I know - just a little longer . MRS . HOAG It 's been over a week now since the incident . p. 13 MORA ( swiftly ) Incident ! Murder - an attempted murder ! MRS . HOAG ( superciliously ) Nothing has happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not left the house and no stranger has come in . MRS . HOAG ( supercilious ) Are you going to keep him looked up forever ? MORA ( courteously ) No ! I 'm going to get him away . MRS . HOAG ( loud ) When ? MORA ( makes a helpless gesture - does not answer ) MRS . HOAG ( nods toward Gilda 's door ) Before she gets back . Is n't that it ? She 's the real danger you 're afraid of - is n't she ? She 's  --  MORA Oh please - ( starts for the stairs ) MRS . HOAG ( turning toward her door ) You 're just neurotic about the boy , that 's all ! MORA ( struck ) Oh ! ( she begins to sob - wildly ) p. 14 O'HIGGINS ( to Evelyn ) Fool ! MRS . HOAG ( airily ) Call me all the names you Mister O'Higgins - you 're just calling them to yourself ! You 're the fool and you know it . She goes to her room . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go in his own door - turns back - looks at Cristina . Her sobs have increased to hysteria . She clings to the wall by the stairs for support . He hesitates , then goes to her . ) O'HIGGINS Can I help you , Madame ? MORA ( between gasps ) Thank you . I 'm quite all right . I just need - O'HIGGINS May I get you anything ? MORA ( recovering ) No - I 'll be all right in a moment . ( apologetically ) I do n't know what came over me ! I do n't know when I 've done a silly thing like this . It 's just - sometimes - once in a while - I do n't know - it 's like something snaps in me ! Everything shatters ! - goes to pieces ! I - O'HIGGINS That woman is beyond anyone 's endurance ! MORA Just that word she used ! p. 15 O'HIGGINS Fool ? MORA Neurotic ! MORA ( crying out ) Is it neurotic to love your son ? - to fight to save his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorant amateurs of the soul are - MORA ( her excitement mounting ) Death waits for my son outside that door , Senor ! If I try to keep him in - just till I can get him away , is that - ( stops suddenly - aware of his eyes on her - and taking hope from them ) Senor - do you know anyone who - forgive my asking you a question like this . I have no right - I know . We 've never even spoken to each other before today . O'HIGGINS ( on the defensive ) You 've never honored me before today . MORA I did n't know you , Senor - before today . But today you come to me and say - " Can I help you ? " and that - ( again excitedly ) Yes ! Yes . You can help me ! Someone must help me . O'HIGGINS I 'll do whatever I can , Madame , but - MORA ( hesitates - looks at him ) We 're both Europeans - I think . That means - exiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bond . p. 16 O'HIGGINS I am not a European , Madame . MORA You look like one . O'HIGGINS I have lived in your Europe many years , Madame . I went there to learn to be a cultivated man , civilized , Christian . All I learned was fighting . I had to come here to these poor savage Indians to find peace . MORA You were in the war ? O'HIGGINS Several wars . MORA What are you ? O'HIGGINS I am an American . MORA Oh --  then you can be of great help to me ! I must get a visa , Senor - to cross the border . O'HIGGINS What border ? MORA Your border ! O'HIGGINS You 've been to the Consulate ? MORA Every day ! I go every day ! They deny me ! O'HIGGINS I see . MORA What am I to do ? They are adamant ! They - O'HIGGINS But , Madame , if the Consulate - MORA There are ways ! People do get visasi - even passports ! p. 17 O'HIGGINS You mean a forged visa - a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must ! O'HIGGINS I 'm afraid what you ask , is impossible . MORA But it is done ! There are people who - O'HIGGINS It would take a great deal of time - and a great deal of money - and - MORA I have neither . O'HIGGINS Even if you had - the negotiations would have to be the most delicate - the most subtle - through just the right middle men and  --  MORA But could n't you  --  O'HIGGINS No - I could not . ( starts to go ) MORA ( her desperation mounting again ) But you could find out ! - without involving yourself - just find out . It 's a matter of life and death - the life of my son - or his death . You heard of the attempt to kill him ! He 's in mortal danger ! Every day I - I - I feel we must go today ! The man who wants his life is  --  O'HIGGINS You know who it is ? MORA Yes - yes - I do . There 's only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 18 O'HIGGINS He has threatened to do so ? MORA He said he would follow him to the ends of the world . He said - O'HIGGINS Why do n't you report this person to the police ? MORA That would be useless - worse than useless . The threat was not made here . It was made back in our country . It comes from our hatreds - our violence - not those here . O'HIGGINS Even so , if there was a threeat and you recognize the man - MORA I do n't recognize him ! I never saw him ! O'HIGGINS Then how can you be sure that - MORA Because of this : Mu husband was a high officer in our war - and - O'HIGGINS ( quickly ) For the Republic ? MORA No ! For God ! and country ! O'HIGGINS ( disappointed ) Ah .  --  Well ? MORA Two Italians - Sicilians - father and son , were brought before my husband accused of spying . The evidence against them was not strong , but my husband was bitter against foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because I felt they were innocent - and they were ! - afterwards we knew they were ! - I begged for their lives - begged till at the last moment - the morning of the execution - my husband had the son brought before him and gave him his life . He said : " I do this because of my own son ! " The boy pled for his father 's life , too , but my husband refused . The boy was put on a boat and returned to Sicily . Weeks later we received a letter . It said : " Because you killed my innocent father , I shall kill your innocent son . " That is the man , Senor . p. 19 O'HIGGINS You believe that he has followed you here ? MORA Yes ! It is perhaps hard to understand a drive like that in a human soul but  --  O'HIGGINS Vengeance ? No ! Of all the dark and complicated urges that drive the human soul , it is one of the most simple . Is this the first time he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France . O'HIGGINS France ? MORA Yes - when the war ended - we left Spain . O'HIGGINS ( a little bitterly ) You left ? You ? The victors ? MORA The victors are often the vanquished , Senor . Disillusion can banish - and can kill . My husband died - of a broken heart - really . All his hopes betrayed - and - O'HIGGINS And you ? MORA Me ? O'HIGGINS Your he art did n't break ? MORA ( smiles ) As long as my son lives - my heart can never break . O'HIGGINS It was not until you were alone there - that he came ? p. 20 MORA Yes - one night when my boy came into the dark hallway of our lodgings - he suddenly sprang out upon him and would have killed him then but - ( she makes a nervous , frightened gesture with her hand ) Well , it passed . A stranger came down the stairs - he turned and fled . ( there is a pause - Cristina is struggling to hold herself together ) O'HIGGINS And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought here ! - here across the ocean ! But - ( she makes a helpless gesture ) Now ! Now ! ( she begins to cry again - weak - frightened and exhausted ) O'HIGGINS ( gently ) Had n't you better sit here by the fountain , and rest a moment ? Water is restful . MORA Yes . Yes . Thank you . ( goes to the fountain ) I do n't want my son to see me like this . He - he would n't understand it . ( sits by the fountain ) This is such a charming old fountain , is n't it ? It makes me think of home . O'HIGGINS Have you a handkerchief ? ( as she reaches for her bag ) I have n't one - not a clean one . ( she hands a fine folded handkerchief ) I 'm afraid this is toofine . I want to wash your face . p. 21 MORA Wash my face ? O'HIGGINS Yes . It 's all streaked . ( he dips the handkerchief into the water and begins to wash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) This makes me feel as I did as a very little child - cared for - surrounded by love - safe in a safe world . O'HIGGINS Did you feel like that as a child ? MORA Do n't all children ? Did n't you ? O'HIGGINS No . I have never felt like that . I have always felt uncared for - alone - in a dangerous world . MORA Even as a child ! O'HIGGINS More so - for then I felt week . ( he has finished washing her face ) There ! ( he spreads the handkerchief on the stones to dry ) MORA Thank you . Have you taken all my make-up off ? ( she takes out a mirror from her bag ) I must look ghastly ! O'HIGGINS You look better . There is great reality in your face now . MORA ( laughs - the face washing has curiously refreshed her ) You mean lines ? p. 22 O'HIGGINS Yes . Life is etched in your face very interestingly - with much contrast - happiness and suffering - trust and fear - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show very much ? O'HIGGINS Yes . In the eyes . MORA I do n't like that ! O'HIGGINS You ca n't help it . It is somewhere in all European faces now . MORA Is there no courage to go with it ? O'HIGGINS Yes . In your face - yes . But not in many . ( studying her ) There is something else there that is not in many - and also in the eyes --  MORA What ? O'HIGGINS The ability to love - a great - an infinite capacity to love . I would like to paint you . You are the first woman of your class I have ever wanted to paint . MORA My class ? What is my class ? O'HIGGINS Upper . You are an aristocrat . MORA ( laughs ) I work in a dress shop . O'HIGGINS That has n't changed your - quality . I 'd like to see if I could get that  --  maybe not . Till now I have painted only working women - and women of the streets - and Indian women . p. 23 MORA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORA Are you at work here ? O'HIGGINS No . I only came here to enter my picture in the national contest . MORA Then I 've seen it ! I went to the exhibition one lunch time . O'HIGGINS You saw plenty of bad painting then . MORA I saw some magnificent painting . O'HIGGINS That was mine . MORA The Indian girl with the great machines ? O'HIGGINS Yes . MORA Oh . ( she looks at him - differently ) O'HIGGINS You liked it ? MORA I thought it one of the finest pictures I 've ever seen - and I 've seen very many ! O'HIGGINS ( swiftly ) Tell me ! I need to hear from someone who - who - Tell me ! MORA What ? O'HIGGINS Everything ! Everything - in detail ! What did you like about it - specially ? Tell me ! p. 24 MORA ( smiling ) I liked the clash and harmony of the whole composition.It came out to me like from a great orchestra . O'HIGGINS ( eagerly ) The way I filled the foreground with the machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the window ? MORA ( nods ) With the figure of the Indian girl between . O'HIGGINS ( satisfied ) Yes ! What else did you like ? MORA I liked the way you painted the machines - with that incredible detail . It made them overwhelming - beautiful - powerful - and yet - dead . O'HIGGINS ( eagerly ) I got that mostly with color ! - greys and blacks and blues . MORA Colors of steel . O'HIGGINS And decay - death . MORA The whole palette is extraordinary ! - the brown girl - brown as the earth - the way her naked body - almost luminous shows through the thin purple rags she wears - and the landscape - all orange and yellows - sunburnt ! - tanned with sun - and swept with air ! You use color quite arbitrarially ! p. 25 O'HIGGINS ( nods ) To express myself forcefully ! MORA ( smiles ) The woman was painted very tenderly . O'HIGGINS I ca n't paint a woman any other way . MORA ( nodding toward Lupe - sitting on her blanket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? O'HIGGINS Lupe is my model . She is not my wife . ( rushing on ) You saw what I wanted to say ? MORA Say ? O'HIGGINS Yes ! These days one must say his say . What did I say ? ( slowly ) MORA You said that machines are overwhelming life - natural life that civilization has become - inhuman - and - O'HIGGINS Yes ! Yes . That 's what I wanted to say ! MORA When is it decided ? O'HIGGINS What ? MORA The contest . O'HIGGINS Oh - sometime this week - any day now . MORA How will you know ? p. 26 O'HIGGINS Oh - they send a deputation to you I believe - all very formal - MORA You will surely win ! O'HIGGINS I doubt it . MORA Doubt it ? Why how can you ? There was nothing there - even in the same class with it . O'HIGGINS ( laughs ) The judges may not know that . MORA One of them is a very good painter , I hear . O'HIGGINS And a very jealous man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down here . Some politician 's nephew will probably win . MORA How can you go on working if you feel like that ? O'HIGGINS ( laughs ) I go on working because I must . ( pause ) And so as not to suffer - too much . MORA ( slowly ) Why do you enter a contest if you feel hopeless about it ? O'HIGGINS I do n't feel hopeless . I doubt . I know all the things that will probably defeat me . But I feel - differently - always . In spite of everything , I 've always felt that I am a traveller going somewhere - to some destination that 's - good . It 's as though I had proof - or a hint - that everything - in the end will be all right with me . And so - p. 27 MORA It will . You have everything ! O'HIGGINS No ! MORA Talent ! Energy ! Originality ! O'HIGGINS ( serious ) Yes- but there is a great emptiness in me somewhere --  that I have never been able to fill ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The phone hangs on the wall under the balcony . It rings again . ) O'HIGGINS The Senorita is out . I 'll answer it . ( he goes to the phone ) Hello - The Senora ? Just a minute . ( to Cristina ) It 's for you . MORA ( surprised ) Me ? No one ever calls me. ( taking the phone ) Hello - hello . ( in the phone ) Who do you want ? Oh the Senora Gilda ! No - she is not here . I do n't know - not before another week - anyway . ( with sudden anxiety ) Who is this ? Who is speaking ? Hello ! Hello ! ( hangs up - very disturbed again - to O'Higgins - troubled ) It was someone for - for her . ( nods towards Gilda 's door ) Some man . ( agitatedly ) Do you suppose she 's due back ? p. 28 O'HIGGINS ( shrugs ) I do n't even know where she went . MORA ( a little bitterly ) She went to Cuernavaca - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here - only two weeks . O'HIGGINS She may show up any day than . MORA But she 's been gone only one week ! O'HIGGINS ( laughs ) You know how things go here . ( makes a gesture of money ) A little oil ! The machine runs faster . MORA ( anxious ) I must get him away before she comes . He 's - utterly - ( stops - helplessly - then goes on - nodding toward Evelyn 's door ) Maybe she was right ! Maybe I am - neurotic ! But I would rather have my boy die than become involved with a woman like that ! O'HIGGINS ( pause - looks at her - then suddenly ) Here ! ( takes a slip of paper out of a small book in his pocket - hands it to her ) MORA What is this ? O'HIGGINS It 's an address . It will get you where you want to go . p. 29 MORA ( low ) A visa ? O'HIGGINS A simpler way than that . Take the train north up the west coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost to the border . Go to that man - at that address . Put yourself in his hands . He will do the rest . MORA He will get us across ? O'HIGGINS Yes . MORA I do not know how to thank you , Senor . I - O'HIGGINS ( starting toward his room ) Do not thank me , thank him . MORA ( suddenly ) Why does he do all this for me ? Do I use your name ? Do I - O'HIGGINS He does it for you because it is his business . He 's a cattle smuggler , but he takes over human beings now and then . There is more in it . MORA ( uneasily ) Oh . O'HIGGINS He 'll ask you a lot - but he 'll do it for a lot less . Make your own bargain . MORA But Senor - I 've only enough to buy our train tickets and - a little more - I - O'HIGGINS Have n't you anything you can sell - or - p. 30 MORA Nothing . O'HIGGINS And I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll get it somewhere ! ( holding out the paper ) This is like a proof of divine protection to me - a miracle ! O'HIGGINS ( drily ) No miracle , Madame . MORA How did you happen to have it ? O'HIGGINS Oh . I thought - for a moment - that if I won the contest I might grant to go home . MORA Then you 'll need this ! for yourself ! O'HIGGINS No -- my papers are in order . I wanted it for Lupe No ! It was just an idea . No ! - win or lose - I am going in the other direction - south to the Indians . ( laughs ) I 'm afraid of the civilized . They 're too dangerous ! MORA ( smiles ) You do not like civilization , do you ? O'HIGGINS ( laughs ) I have a recurrent need to destroy it . MORA ( slowly ) I know . I feel that , too , at times . But  --  is n't it being done for us ? - destroyed - I mean . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there any salvation there ? p. 31 O'HIGGINS The only one I see . MORA Ca n't we go ahead - differently ? O'HIGGINS What is going to make us - different ? MORA We were taught a way - to become - different ! - to become - new ! O'HIGGINS It has n't seemed to work . MORA ( turns to go - then ) Why did n't you give me this before - when I first - O'HIGGINS I did n't know you before . I did n't recognize you - until you recognized me . MORA ( sincerely ) I am glad we are no longer strangers . O'HIGGINS ( quickly ) We know each other very well ! You have seen my picture - and I have heard you play . Every night I have heard you playing above me . MORA Oh - I 'm sorry . When other women pray - I play . Has it disturbed you ? O'HIGGINS ( nods ) Very much . ( laughs ) I shall miss it . ( then seriously ) Strange . All my life - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has always been someone near me - playing in the night . When I first went to Paris to learn to paint - every night - in the room next - a violin ! And then in the prison in Spain - a gypsy in the cell next to me - all night long playing a guitar . p. 32 MORA You were in Spain ? O'HIGGINS Yes . MORA For the Republic ? O'HIGGINS Yes . MORA Against us ? O'HIGGINS Yes . I was one of those foreigners your husband so resented . MORA ( quietly ) Then we are not only strangers , Senor - we are enemies . ( she starts swiftly toward the stairs - turns - cries out ) In spite of - of - everything ! - enemies ! ( she starts up the stairs ) ( O'Higgins looks after her ) ( Herculano , who has been awaiting his chance , comes from the zaguan - one eye on the door - one eye on the chicken cooking in the pot . ) HERCULANO Senor - MORA ( from the balcony ) Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Senora . I know the importance of the door . But there is something I forgot to tell the Senor - also of importance . O'HIGGINS ( to him ) Go back to the door , friend . Herculano starts back toward the zaguan . Cristina goes off into her room . Herculano turns back - eying the chicken . p. 33 O'HIGGINS ( a little impatient ) What is it you want , friend ? LUPE He wants more chicken . O'HIGGINS Give it to him . HERCULANO ( protesting ) Ah no , Senor - no more chicken - no - no ! O'HIGGINS ( handing him a piece of chicken ) Here ! ( as Herculano makes a protesting gesture ) Take It . Never refuse chicken . HERCULANO ( taking it ) If you insist , Senor ! But this is not why I came ! O'HIGGINS ( starting in his own door ) I know , friend . HERCULANO ( starting for the zaguan with his chicken - turns ) There was a man came to see you , Senor . O'HIGGINS ( turning at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrugs ) Who knows , Senor . O'HIGGINS What did he want ? HERCULANO Who knows . p. 34 O'HIGGINS Did n't he leave his name ? HERCULANO ( shakes his head ) No , Senor . O'HIGGINS Well - what did he look like ? HERCULANO ( shrugs ) He looked like a man , Senor . O'HIGGINS ( leasing patience ) Ay ! HERCULANO He said it was about a painting . O'HIGGINS ( eagerly ) A painting ! Why did n't you tell me ? Why did n't you call me ? HERCULANO Lupe said you were asleep . O'HIGGINS I was n't asleep ! ( to Lupe ) Why did you say I was asleep ? LUPE You were lying on the bed . O'HIGGINS But not asleep ! HERCULANO ( disappearing into the zaguan ) He 'll be back . O'HIGGINS How do you know ? HERCULANO He said so . O'HIGGINS When ? HERCULANO Who knows ? He said right away . It wo n't take him long . He has a big car and a big chauffeur and  --  p. 35 O'HIGGINS ( crying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's from the government ! Yes , I 've won ! I 've won !

You 're just calling them to yourself . ( to Prudencio ) Why were you ? PRUDENCIO What ? MRS . HOAG Lute . You 're two hours late . PRUDENCIO That 's not late !

PRUDENCIO ( more dignity ) He wants to put me on the air . MRS . HOAG On the air ! Prudie , why did n't you tell me ! PRUDENCIO ( injured ) He was to see me this morning already . That 's why I 'm late . MRS . HOAG When will you start ? PRUDENCIO Just as soon as I pay him the money . MRS . HOAG You pay him ! Why he 's got to pay you ! PRUDENCIO That 's not the way we do it here . MRS . HOAG I do n't believe it . p. 38 PRUDENCIO ( dignified ) You think I am lying to you ? MRS . HOAG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't lie - to me .

HOAG I understand you , Prudie . You must feel that through my love . Who appreciates you as I do ? Who  --  PRUDENCIO You appreciate my love , but not my art . MRS . HOAG They are the same ! ( Prudencio shakes his head ) It 's all one , Prudie . All the creative urge of the artist is really just the libido . One must understand these things . You do n't realize what I am doing for you , Prudie . My gift to you is boundless . You do n't appreciate it ! I give you everything . Nothing I withhold - nothing . PRUDENCIO You are going to give me the money for the man ? MRS . HOAG ( taken down - a little sharply ) How much does he want ? PRUDENCIO ( shrugs ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honesty - the rest later . Just whatever you think correct . You always know . Enter Herculano from the zaguan - going immediately to O'Higgins ' door and knocking . p. 39 HERCULANO ( speaking close to the door ) The man from the government is here , Senor , for the painting . The car just drove up . O'HIGGINS Bring him in . Herculano goes to the zaguan . O'HIGGINS ( to Evelyn ) Could I have it here - to myself - for a few minutes ? Prudencio moves toward Evelyn 's door . MRS . HOAG No , Prudie ! We have just as much right here as he has . I pay my rent ! I - Enter from zaguan , HARRY BLISS . Harry Bliss is a small , beautifully tailored , dapper man who always looks- and smells - as though he had just stepped out of a barber 's chair . He has made a lot of money that 's making him a lot more . He got a piece of the new racetrack and a piece of the new gambling casino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and imagination at the moment is his new night club that he plans to make the most chic - and the most profitable - in Mexico . BLISS ( coming on - holding out his hand ) Mr. O'Higgins ? O'HIGGINS Yes . BLISS The painter ? O'HIGGINS Yes . p. 40 BLISS I 'm glad to know you Maestro . I guess you know who I am . O'HIGGINS No . BLISS Bliss ? Harry Bliss . O'HIGGINS No . BLISS You must a heard of my new night club - " The Leda ? " O'HIGGINS No . BLISS Do n't you read the papers ? O'HIGGINS No . BLISS The papers are always full a me . Lupe comes shyly out of the room - and leans against the wall there . She looks very beautiful - washed and brushed and with red flowers in her hair . Bliss looks at her appreciatively - then goes on to O'Higgins . BLISS Well , Maestro , I have good news for you ! General Gonzales had a big dinner at the Club last night - for his son-in-law - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess you know that , do n't you ? O'HIGGINS No . BLISS Did n't you hear it on the radio this morning ? O'HIGGINS No . BLISS Have n't you got a radio ? p. 41 O'HIGGINS No . BLISS My God ! Has n't even got a radio ! So you do n't know you lost ? O'HIGGINS No . BLISS My God - that 's bad . I came to make you an offer - thought I 'd come when you were feeling low - ( quickly ) Cheer you up . ( as O'Higgins says nothing ) Well - this is the doal , Maestro - At the party last night just a private party - only about a hundred people - but all big shots - big shots and their women - one of ' em was kind of a critic - could n't get you off his mind . The drunker BLISS he got , the more you worried him . " Holy Saints , " he kept sayin ' - " how the fellow can paint flesh ! " - That impressed me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can paint it - so that 's the deal - a lovely lookin ' woman - naked - lyin ' in lilies ! How 's that for an idea for you , Maestro ? I often give artists ideas . ( as O'Higgins makes no response - he goes on - his eye has fallen on Lupe and he feels very creative ) Her flesh has got to be white - white as a lily . I like a brown skin myself- I even like black - but white has the universal appeal . Well - what do you say , Maestro ? O'HIGGINS No . BLISS No cheap barroom stuff - the work of a master . High-class people come to my place - very high - and the higher they are the tougher they are to impress . We 'll call it " Woman with Lilies . " Do n't that sell it to you ? p. 42 O'HIGGINS No . BLISS But think of the publicity , Maestro ! Your painting hanging over my bar will be seen by more connisures than in any gallery you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen in the right mood by connisures feeling good - not by a lot of dopes with cold feet and a backache . Have you considered that , Maestro ? O'HIGGINS No . BLISS But Maestro ! Your painting over my bar will make you ! Millionaires are crowding up there every afternoon and every night - promoters from New York - statesmen from Washington - directors from Hollywood - oil men from Dallas . Why , Maestro , it 's an opportunity you ca n't afford to pass up . What do you say ? O'HIGGINS No . BLISS I 'll give you one thousand pesos for the job , Maestro . O'HIGGINS No . BLISS But Maestro - O'HIGGINS ( loud ) No ! Get out ! No ! BLISS Well - if that 's the way you feel . ( starts toward the zaguan ) You follows dig your own graves . MRS . HOAG ( calls ) Mr. Bliss ? p. 43 BLISS ( turns from the entrance of the zaguan ) Yeah ? MRS . HOAG I 'm Mrs. Evelyn Hoag , Mr. Bliss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? MRS . HOAG I 've discovered a wonderful native artist , Mr. Bliss - really a - BLISS Does he paint ? MRS . HOAG No . He sings . BLISS ( turns to go ) Oh - MRS . HOAG He 's simply marvellous , Mr. Bliss ! He 's better than Tito Guizar ! Hear him sing now , Mr. Bliss . He  --  BLISS ( going ) No time now . MRS . HOAG He 's as good as Sinatra ! BLISS ( turning back ) Yeah ? MRS . HOAG Give him an audition , Mr. Bliss - let him  --  BLISS OK . OK . I 'll give him an audition . I 'm always willing to give an artist a chance . ( turns toward the door ) MRS . HOAG When , Mr. Bliss ? What day ? p. 44 BLISS ( a little irritably ) Any day . I 'm always willing to see an artist . MRS . HOAG We 'll come today ! You 'll never regret it , Mr. Bliss . He simply melts you . Bliss disappears into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Evelyn - Lupe is clining to O'Higgins and talking fast . LUPE One thousand pesosi How many chickens in one thousand pesos ! One thousand pesos - how many chickens ? Chickens ! Never refuse chicken ! You told Herculano - never refuse chicken - one thousand pesos ! - chicken - chicken To all this O'Higgins remains unmoved as though some puppy were barking at his feet . But now there is the sound of music - a piano in the room above . As Bliss disappears into the zaguan - O'Higgins calls out . O'HIGGINS Wait ! BLISS ( turning ) Yeah ? O'HIGGINS ( with effort ) Will you - will you give me the money now ? BLISS How much ? O'HIGGINS ( loud ) One thousand pesos ! p. 45 BLISS Now ? O'HIGGINS Now . And one thousand when it is done . BLISS ( shocked ) No ! O'HIGGINS ( turning to his door ) All right - no ! BLISS If you 'd make a mural - I might - O'HIGGINS All right - a mural . BLISS The whole space over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ! I 'll take a chance . ( takes out a piece of paper - begins to write ) O'HIGGINS I want the money now . BLISS ( nods ) I 'm always willing to take a chance ! Sign here . ( O'Higgins signs - Bliss takes it - looks at it . ) BLISS ( checking it over rapidly ) One mural - Woman with Lilies - 820. ( satisfied puts it away carefully in a folder - takes a out a fat roll of bills - begins to count ) When will you deliver her Maestro ? O'HIGGINS When I 've painted her . p. 46 BLISS Are you a fast worker ? O'HIGGINS It 'll go fast . BLISS That 's the right attitude , Maestro. ( after-thought ) I want a good job , of course ! O'HIGGINS You 'll get a good job . BLISS ( satisfied ) OK Maestro , I leave it all to you now . All I ever do for an artist is give him an idea . ( he starts off ) PRUDENCIO Could I have some advance too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need a costume to sing in - and - BLISS ( going out the door ) You ai n't hired yet . He is . Exit Bliss O'HIGGINS ( stands staring after him ) Dog ! ( turns to Lupe ) Go upstairs to the Senora - tell her I want to speak to her . Lupe runs up the stairs to Cristina 's door . MRS . HOAG ( to Prudencio - impressively ) Now you have your big chance , Prudie . " The Leda " - that 's tops ! p. 47 PRUDENCIO ( a little morose ) I want to buy a charro costume . MRS . HOAG We can rent one , Prudie ! Let 's go now . ( she is moving toward the outer door ) PRUDENCIO ( following her ) They 're lousy . MRS . HOAG Well - we can look , Prudie . We can  --  PRUDENCIO ( following her off ) You ca n't find ' em . They hide in the seems . They 're smart . Prudencio and Evelyn off . O'HIGGINS Dogs ! Sinforosa comes on from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - starts off . O'HIGGINS Senorita ! SINFOROSA ( turning patiently ) Yes , Senor . O'HIGGINS I 'll want the room - another month . ( suddenly nodding to Evelyn 's room ) And this room . SINFOROSA But Mrs. Evelyn ? O'HIGGINS Put her out ! SINFOROSA But Senor ! She pays her rent every month . She - p. 48 O'HIGGINS ( peeling off a bill ) Here 's the rent . Throw her out ! SINFOROSA ( taking the money uneasily ) But why , Senor ? She  --  O'HIGGINS I do n't want to breathe the air of that woman any more . It stinks to heaven . Lupe comes down the stairs . She has gone to Cristina 's door and the music there has stopped . LUPE ( at the foot of the stairs ) She 's coming . ( O'Higgins turns - stands looking up at the baloony - waiting . Cristina appears - comes quickly along the balcony and down the stairs ) SINFOROSA ( to Lupe - low ) Where did he get all this money ? LUPE He won the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint in then ? LUPE ( nods happily ) A big picture with a lot of lilies ! SINFOROSA Ah ! Then in that case ! She goes off into the corridor . MORA You want me ? O'HIGGINS Yes . ( thrusts the roll of money towards her ) Here . p. 49 MORA What is that ? O'HIGGINS Money ! Money for your - MORA But , Senor - I ca n't take money from you ! O'HIGGINS Why not ? MORA I told you ! We are enemies ! We are - O'HIGGINS Enemies ? MORA Yes ! You were on the other side ! O'HIGGINS ( roughly ) Side ? What do sides mean now to people like you and me ? Sides ? They are tearing the world to pieces . They kill and they betray ! Yes ! shift --  sell themselves --  barter their faith from day to day . All that matters now are people --  from one side or the other side --  a few scattered people ! MORA What people ? O'HIGGINS People like you and me ! the disillusioned who still have hope ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tie between people like us --  stronger than any of your sides- or countries- or races --  or any of the rest of it . We recognize each other from the ends of the earth . And --  we know a duty to help each other whereever we meet .  --  - Take this ! ( he thrusts the money into her hands ) MORA ( slowly ) I will take-half. ( she hands part back to him ) p. 50 O'HIGGINS ( looks at her- nods- smiles- takes it- turns swiftly --  and starts toward the outer door . ) Lupe who has been waiting in the entrance to the kitchen corridor comes out quickly . LUPE Where are you going ? O'HIGGINS I 'm going to get a woman . LUPE What woman ? O'HIGGINS A white woman - white as a lily ! LUPE ( more uneasy ) To sleep with ? O'HIGGINS ( thundering ) No ! To paint ! - with lilies . LUPE But you say you can not paint a woman good unless you know her good . O'HIGGINS For this painting I do not need to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( he starts toward the outer door - Lupe darts at him - begins to hit him - claws at him - screaming and kicking ) O'HIGGINS ( surprised ) What 's the matter Lupe ? LUPE Money ! Money to buy a chicken ! O'HIGGINS ( remembering ) Ah - ah yes . ( hands her money ) p. 51 LUPE ( happy ) All that for a chicken ? O'HIGGINS For a dress . I 'll buy the chicken . ( he starts off into the zaguan and out the main door that Herculano opens for him - stops - gives him a coin ) You , too , friend . Here 's some money for you ! He goes . Lupe resentful at this goes off into O'Higgins ' room counting the money he has given her . Cristina who has been looking after O'Higgins - turns - starts for the stairs - calling up to Tony . MORA ( joyful ) Tony ! Tony ! Enter GILDA , a smart , modern , attractive , passionate woman in her early forties , who has - after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this marriage , she has come to Mexico to get a quick divorce . Tony appears on the balcony , looks down . MORA ( delighted - starts down the stairs ) Gilda ! I thought it was my mother 's voice . ( comes to her from the foot of the stairs - not seeing his mother ) Darling , is it all over ? Did you get it ? GILDA Of course . ( sees Cristina and is a little self-conscious ) p. 52 MORA You do n't look any different . Do you feel any different ? GILDA Of course ! MORA Tell me all about it . Tell me everything that happened . It 's been deadly here without you . ( suddenly a little embarrassed ) I 'll say it 's been deadly . I 've got lots to tell you about ! GILDA As soon as I wash up we 'll go downtown and have a cocktail and talk . MORA Right . Gilda goes to her door . MORA ( coming forward ) Tony can not leave the house , Senora . MORA ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go on keeping me bottled up like this - like some kind of a fly crawling around in a trap . I ca n't stand it any longer ! I 've got to get out ! I - MORA ( soothing ) I know , dear - I know . MORA ( going on ) No , you do n't know ! I 'd rather be killed ! If I 'm going to be killed , I 'm going to be killed anyway . GILDA ( swiftly ) Killed ? p. 53 MORA Oh somebody took a shot at me the other day and  --  GILDA Who ? When ? MORA The day after you left . GILDA ( agitatedly ) Did you see him ? Did you  --  MORA Oh let 's not talk about it . I 'm sick of it ! GILDA But - MORA I 'll tell you about it afterwards - when we 're out of here . Gilda looks at him - then goes slowly into her room - closes the door . MORA You gave me your word , Tony ! You - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you did n't get them . MORA We 're going , Tony . MORA Going ? How ? When ? MORA Today - now ! Everything 's arranged . We take the afternoon train . MORA But , Mother I ca n't go now . MORA Why ca n't you ?

She got a divorce on account of me . She - MORA She came here to get a divorce . MORA She came here to get away from her husband - yes , but she had n't made up her mind to divorce him til - MORA Oh , Tony , you 're so young ! so - MORA You 're always telling me that , Mother ! I 'm tired of hearing it - tired of being it - I - I 'm going to marry Gilda , Mother . MORA Marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you 're saying This is madness ! That is - MORA You usually say " nonsense " Mother . Madness ? I like that better . It sounds more important , more - Maybe I 'm growing up in your eyes . Am I ? Mother ? Getting just a little older ? MORA You 'll never be as old as she is if you live to be a hundred . MORA That is not worthy of you , Mother . MORA ( ashamed ) I know , Tony , I know . ( she makes a nervous helpless gesture with her hand ) But this thing happening now - just now ! - no-happening any time . Why , she 's had one lover after another ! There is an odor of stale bedrooms about her that  --  p. 55 MORA ( flippantly ) She uses a lovely perfume , Mother . MORA Do n't smile - like that ! - it 's like a smirk from the gallows ! Oh Tony ! There 's nothing you can do in life that is as important as the woman you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we make to others that we live ! Do n't marry this woman , Tony ! MORA I 've got to Mother ! I 'm already her lover . MORA Oh - MORA I know that shocks you but  --  MORA ( slowly ) No - no it does n't shock me. ( pause ) But why do you want to marry her - if - MORA ( shrugs ) Oh - more convenient - I guess . ( seeing her face ) You can go on living in ideals , Mother ! But I 'm going to live in reality ! Take the world as it is - and get the most out of it I can - and in the easiest way . MORA Already you 've become cheap , cynical , and - vulgar ! MORA Like the world I live in , Mother ! ( crying out ) I 'm going to live life as it is ! MORA And is that life as it is ? - sneaking down to a cheap woman 's room at night - crawling into bed with her like a - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that way - yes ! MORA No ! No ! There 's more to it than that . It 's not as easy and as cheap as that ! ( rushing on ) It is in saying " No " - that a man finds his life - as much as in saying " Yes . " That no ! That - MORA That old world of denial of yours ! MORA That - no ! This - yes ! MORA ( angry ) This - yes ? What this ? This life here ? Hunted - frightened - cowering behind a door ? No ! Now I say - no ! I 'm going out of here today ! - and with a woman ! - and - MORA ( pleading ) Not this woman , Tony . She 'll ruin you in body and soul - she 'll  --  MORA ( laughs ) I 'm not so weak as you think , Mother . I 'm tougher than you know . MORA Then do n't marry her - Tony ! MORA Yes - I 'm going to marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . MORA She ? Why ? MORA She loves me , I suppose . ( as Cristina makes an impatient gesture ) You saw how upset she was now - then - p. 57 MORA Yes ! - and I wondered why . MORA ( angry ) Why ? Because she loves me I tell you ! MORA Love ! She does n't know what the word means ! MORA Do you , Mother ? ( as she stares at him ) Does anybody ? MORA Yes ! - yes , I know what it means . MORA ( impatient ) Now you 're going to say " to lay down one 's life for another and all that stuff . Oh , I know all you 've done for me - gone through - the privations - but - MORA That is n't what I mean , Tony . MORA Then what do you mean ? MORA I mean - the love your father had - for me.

Has anything he died for been won ? p. 58 MORA Not yet - maybe - but  --  MORA When ? When ? Is n't it all wiped out - lost ? MORA No ! ( as he makes an impatient gesture ) As long as some man live - who do n't give up - just inside themselves - just in their hearts - a few men - MORA Where are they - dead or in jail ? MORA They are scattered over the world - here and there - they - Sinforosa comes on - starts towards Evelyn 's room . MORA Senorita ! SINFOROSA ( turning ) Yes , Senora .

Lupe comes on - starts toward outer door . She has a roboso over her head and carries a bright straw bag . HERCULANO ( at Evelyn 's door ) Where you going ? To market ? LUPE No . HERCULANO Where ? LUPE ( proudly ) I 'm going to buy a radio ! HERCULANO A radio ? For the love of God ! Have you money enough to buy a radio ? LUPE ( nods ) For one month ! HERCULANO What do you want a radio for ? I should think you 'd rather have something else with all that money . LUPE I would rather have something else . HERCULANO Then why do you buy one ? LUPE Because I 'm ashamed . That man that was here - he laughed at us because we did n't have one ! HERCULANO ( nodding ) Ah yes ! Then you must get one . It is n't good to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lupe goes into the zaguan and out the door . Sinforosa comes on from the corridor with an earthen jar . She fills it at the fountain - goes off with it into the corridor again . The outer door opens . SARMONTE comes on . He is an Italian about 30 - handsome in a vulgar way - strong-looking - and well-dressed . He looks around the patio as though getting his bearings - then goes straight to Gilda 's door - knocks . p. 61 GILDA ( off ) I will be right out , Tony . SARMONTE It is n't Tony . It 's me. ( there is a silence - he looks at the door - smiles - turns away - lights a cigarette ) Gilda appears at her door . GILDA ( coming to Sarmonte swiftly ) Oh , Sarmonte ! How did you know I was here ?

( laughs ) Women make me sick . They like to play - feel important - but when it turns out to be the real thing - they lose their guts . GILDA ( suddenly ) Sarmonte , did you try to kill this boy here the day after I left ? SARMONTE ( laughs ) Me ? GILDA ( rushing on ) Is that why you wanted me to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ?

GILDA ( fear mounting ) Is that why you want to get rid of me now ? Get me out of she way - so - SARMONTE I 'm not getting rid of you - nor you of me. p. 64 GILDA Oh , Sarmonte , why do you want to do a thing like this ? He 's no danger to anyone - or anything .

SARMONTE It 's for you to go out and get a drink . HERCULANO Oh , thank you , Senor !

A kid ! - a baby ! - still sucking his mother ! Jesus ! do n't you know a boy like that can never satisfy a woman like you ? p. 65 GILDA Like me ? What do you know about me ? SARMONTE Everything !

SARMONTE You loathe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? GILDA Yes ! SARMONTE But you like it ! Good ! Makes it all the better ! GILDA ( breaking down ) Why did I ever get mixef up with you ? Why did I - SARMONTE If it was n't me , it would be somebody else . GILDA You degrade me so ! - make me feel so low ! - so trapped - SARMONTE ( jeering ) Why trap ? GILDA Myself . You destroy me in my own mind . You take all hope away from me - all  --  ( as he laughs ) Yes - all my life - all the men  --  all the degradation - all the vice - all of it - I 've hoped - I 've longed - all my life for decency - Yes ! for purity ! - for - ( as he laughs again ) Yes .

GILDA ( turns- stares at Sarmonte- then- low ) You do want to kill him ! SARMONTE ( still looking up at the balcony-makes no answer ) GILDA ( crying out ) Why ? SARMONTE ( still makes no answer ) GILDA ( frantic ) But I told you he is n't doing anything here ! not anything ! Nothing ! no politics- no scheming- no spying- he is n't an agent for anything --  or anybody --  he --  SARMONTE ( turning to her ) Then why did he come here ? p. 69 GILDA For his mother ! She wanted it ! SARMONTE His mother , eh ? and what about hisfather ? GILDA His father 's dead ! SARMONTE He was a big man on the other side -- did n't he ever tell you of him ? GILDA No .

( turns to him- frightened at the door ) You 're going with me , Sarmonte ? SARMONTE You 're going with me . They go . Gilda first-Sarmonte after . Sound of taxi starting . Tony comes out of his room . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balcony- starts toward the stairs-hesitates -- goes to his mother 's door-knocks . MORA Mother ! MORA ( opens the door ) Oh Tony -- you 're ready ! Come in , dear . I 've just got to --  I wont be a minute --  come in ! MORA I 'm not coming with you , mother . I 'm going with her . MORA Oh . MORA ( crying out ) I cant help it , mother ! ( angry ) Do nt take it like this ! I 'm not the first man who left his mother to marry . ( as she turns to go into her room ) Wont you say good bye ? MORA ( shakes her hoad -- no ) p. 71 MORA Then I will . Goodbye , mother . ( turns goes down the stairs ) Cristina turns --  watches him go . He goes down the stairs- goes to Gilda 's door -- knocks . MORA Gilda -- Gilda ! He opens the door -- looks in --  sees the empty room --  starts swiftly for the outer door . MORA Gilda ! There is a shot . It comes from the zaguan . MORA ( crying out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother . ( he sinks to the ground ) MORA ( starting down the stairs ) I 'm coing , Tony . I 'm coming !

The patio is getting dark . Beside the door to O'Higgins ' room is a new radio in an elaborate cabinet . On the radio is a cheap kitchen clock with a broken leg . Beside the clock is a small pottery jug . From the radio comes the sound of Mexican mountain singers , falsetto Indian voices in a monotonous Indian song , accompanied by a squeaky violin . There is a loud hammering on the door . LUPE appears at door to O'Higgins ' room . She has been taking a sponge bath and is almost naked . One towel is around her and with another one she is drying herself . LUPE ( calling ) Senoita @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more worried - more harassed than over . SINFOROSA What is it ? LUPE Someone is at the door . SINFOROSA Where is Herculano ? LUPE At the corner . ( makes the Nexican gesture of drinking ) SINFOROSA ( dreary ) Always !

SINFOROSA Who knows , Senor ? BLISS ( more impatient ) Where is he ? SINFOROSA Who knows . LUPE ( calling out ) He is wandering . BLISS ( coming in ) Wandering ? Sinforosa goes off into the corridor . LUPE ( nods ) He gets tired - and then he wanders . The day you were here- he got tired . BLISS And he 's been wandering ever since ? ( Lupe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he is rested . BLISS ( angry ) And what about my mural I ordered ? p. 74 LUPE ( shrugs ) Who knows ? BLISS When is he going to start ? LUPE Who knows ? BLISS But - ( irritably - nodding toward the radio ) Turn that thing off ! It drives me crazy ! LUPE ( nods understandingly ) My music - not your music . BLISS Music ? LUPE ( nods toward the radio ) Everybody has their music - what they like - it 's in there  --  BLISS ( more irritably ) Turn it off ! ( Lupe picks up the little jug - says nothing ) What 's that for ? ( she jingles a few coins in the jug - says nothing ) Oh - ( he puts a coin in the jug - Lupe turns off the radio ) LUPE ( proud ) I got a business . EVELYN comes from the outer door - starts to cross to her own door . MRS . HOAG ( to Lupe ) Did my letter come ? ( recognizes Bliss ) Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is an honor ! p. 75 BLISS Yeah ? MRS . HOAG How - how is Prudencio doing ? BLISS Great - the women are nuts about him . Have n't you been in to hear him ? MRS . HOAG ( embarrassed ) No  --  he said I better not for a while .

BLISS ( as Lupe counts her coins ) I 'll say you got a business ! ( now interested ) Where did you get that thing ? LUPE That money you gave O'Higgins for the prize . BLISS You bought this ? LUPE ( proudly ) Yes ! ( shrugs ) One month but they wo n't take it away for two or three . BLISS ( respectfully ) I did n't think you people had it in you !

Ask a policeman - " The Leda . " LUPE ( a little eagerly ) Where Prudencio works ? BLISS Yes . ( There is an uproar - and from outside comes the sound of O'Higgins ' voice singing an Irish song about a colleen . ) LUPE ( calling out ) O'Higgins ! Enter from the zaguan , O'HIGGINS . He looks exhausted and disheveled , but he is still going strong . He carries a scrawny chicken in one hand and on the other arm is PEG . PEG is a pale , used-up , dilapidated Irish girl , with red hair and very white skin . She wears cheap extravagant-looking clothes and is a pretty battered-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) O'Higgins ! ( calling out for all in the house to hear ) O'Higgins is home ! O'HIGGINS Back to the sacredness of the home ! ( presenting Peg ) Lupe - Peg . Peg - Lupe . Lupe has rushed to him - is clinging to him on one side - Peg on the other . He tries to have an arm for both women - at the same time clinging to his chicken . Sinforosa appears in the corridor . SINFOROSA Oh - Senor O'Higgins ! Thanks be to San Antonio . You are home ! O'HIGGINS Safe at home ! The refuge of the home ! ( seeing Bliss ) Oh God - what are you doing here ?

PEG ( calmly , speaking in a rich Irish brogue ) Throwing a chicken to the dogs . SINFOROSA Chicken ? PEG ( calmly ) Yes - he 's been doing that all day - buying a chicken and throwing it to dogs . p. 81 LUPE ( suddenly ) Good chicken ? PEG ( calmly ) Good chicken . LUPE ( angry ) Good chicken ! ( turns indignant - goes into her room ) O'HIGGINS ( coming in from zaguan ) That 's over ! ( exhausted ) Now I can get to work ! ( rallying ) You 're a wonder to paint , Peg , my girl ! You say it all ! - all there is to say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room - my pretty one . MRS .

Civilization is a terrible thing ! When women want love there 's nothing for them but a voice ! - coming out of a box ! - a goat 's voice !  --  SINFOROSA ( nodding to the radio ) Prudencio ! O'HIGGINS Prudencio ? ( starts toward radio again - Prudencio 's voice comes to an end ) MRS . HOAG Yes , Prudencio - a real artist ! And when I listen to him it 's for his artistry - his art - his  --  O'HIGGINS ( laughs ) Hypocrite ! Coward ! MRS . HOAG Call me all the names you want , Mister O'Higgins ! You just call them to yourself ! ( she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - to Sinforosa ) Well - where are you going to put the girl for me , Senorita ? She must have a room . SINFOROSA ( protesting ) Oh , Senor - I have a respectable house . ( as he makes a gesture ) Yes - I know I let you have Lupe in your room - but - ( sentimentally ) That is different . If Lupe does anything bad - she does it for love - or out of the goodness of her heart - or for her needs as a woman . But a streetwalker ! MRS . HOAG ( turning in her doorway ) A streetwalker ? SINFOROSA I want only decent people in my house . O'HIGGINS She 's decent . MRS . HOAG And takes men from the street O'HIGGINS Only for a decent reason . MRS . HOAG ( outraged ) Decent ? O'HIGGINS She needs the money . He pays her - she do n't pay him - with the money another men gives her . MRS .

O'HIGGINS Yes ! - to the truth ! That 's always too far . ( as she starts back to the corridor - firmly ) What room , Senorita ? SINFOROSA ( on the defensive ) Oh , Senor - every room is taken ! O'HIGGINS ( Pointing upstairs ) What about those rooms ? SINFOROSA ( shocked ) Tony 's room ? O'HIGGINS Yes . SINFOROSA You mean that , Senor ! O'HIGGINS Yes ! SINFOROSA ( now beyond her patience - calls ) Senora Cristina ! Senora  --  p. 85 O'HIGGINS ( surprised ) She is still here ? SINFOROSA She has not left her room . O'HIGGINS Why not ? Because her boy went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead . O'HIGGINS ( struck ) Dead ?  --  ah . SINFOROSA Murdered ! Shot down in cold blood ! The day you  --  CRISTINA appears on the balcony . Her dress is black , and she seems smaller - like a figure that has receded , is far away . And she is far away , for grief has gone on to despair , despair to hopelessness , hopelessness to apathy . It needs only one step more for her , and she will be over the edge of reality altogether . MORA You called me , Senorita ? SINFOROSA Yes . MORA What do you want of me ? SINFOROSA The Senor wants you to give this woman he brought home your empty room . MORA Tony 's room ? SINFOROSA Yes !

I will paint her with  --  EVELYN comes on - she carries a drab suitcase - and a bright woven Mexican bag - she is highly nervous - but tries not to show it . MRS . HOAG ( dignified ) I 'm leaving , Senorita . SINFOROSA ( uneasily ) For good ! MRS . HOAG Yes ! I wo n't live in a house where I 'm called a name like that ! SINFOROSA But where are you going ? MRS . HOAG I do n't know yet ! Back to my own country I guess - where men are gentlemen and  --  O'HIGGINS ( under his breath ) Husbands are fools ! p. 87 MRS . HOAG ( more dignified ) I 've left my trunk Senorita . I 'll send for it tomorrow - as soon as I know . SINFOROSA Very good , Mrs. Evelyn . MRS . HOAG ( a little apologetic ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have time . I want you to do it for me , will you ? SINFOROSA But-Mrs Evelyn -- I have MRS . HOAG ( agitated ) I must see someone before I leave --  and I have to hurry --  or I'll -- I 'll miss him .  --  Here ! ( es Sinforosa a bill ) SINFOROSA ( taking the bill gracefully without looking at it ) Of course , Mrs Evelyn --  with pleasure . MRS . HOAG I know it will be all right -- you 're honest . ( goes to door --  turns back to O'Higgins ) As for you , Daniel O'Higgins -- you hate me -- I know . And I know why , - because I am your shadow -- as you call it ! If I 've run away from my failure at home --  well --  so have you ! If I 'm down here to escape --  so are you ! And if I 've tried to find some kind of love here --  well so have you --  and that 's why you hate me --  because I keep reminding you of yourself ! She goes out the door.O'Higgins , ( struck stands staring after her ) ( to himself ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at bill -- it is only one peso ) Pack her trunk for her !

Not lyin on no junk pile , he wont ! ( goes to outer door -- turns back to O'Higgins ) You said I 'd be lyin on lilies ! She goes . O'HIGGINS Lilies ! ( He makes a gesture after her- then overcome by exhaustion- he sits by the fountain ) Oh God how alone I am ! ( he looks around the patio -- suddenly calls out desperately ) Lupe ! Lupe ! Lupe appears at the door -- she is dressed Lupe ( in the doorway --  coldly ) What do you want ? O'HIGGINS ( crying out ) Want ! Want ! LUPE ( firmly ) Yes ! Why did you call me ? O'HIGGINS Did I call you , Lupe ? LUPE Yes . O'HIGGINS ( contritely ) I know . Sometimes I call when I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to call ! p. 89 LUPE ( angry ) Oh ! ( turns to go back into room ) O'HIGGINS Now you are mad at me . LUPE Yes ! O'HIGGINS Why ? Because I did n't come back ? LUPE ( angry ) Because you give away everything ! Everything you have , you give away ! O'HIGGINS No ! That is the trouble with me , Lupe - I ca n't give away what I have ! LUPE You give away your chicken . O'HIGGINS ( gently ) Yes . I give my chicken . But I want to give my work ! - my work and my love ! I carry them with me wherever I go , Lupe - and they are a heavy load . But nobody wants them . LUPE Oh ! ( turns to go turns back ) Do you want me now ? or do n't you ? O'HIGGINS No . I do n't want you , Lupe . But I have to have you ! O'HIGGINS ( gets to his feet ) That is the other side of the trouble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now ? p. 90 O'HIGGINS Yes ! ( wearily ) I want to rest , Lupe ! And yes ! - I can rest with you . LUPE Well !  --  come ! O'HIGGINS ( starts toward the room - stops - looks up at the balcony ) Now I remember why I called you , Lupe - what happened here - when I was gone ? LUPE ( indifferently ) Tony was killed . ( points ) There ! O'HIGGINS How ? LUPE With a gun . O'HIGGINS Who ? LUPE ( shrugs ) Who knows . O'HIGGINS Was n't anyone here ? LUPE Nobody was here . O'HIGGINS Was n't Herculano at the door ? LUPE ( outraged ) Herculano Ha ! ( accusing ) You give him money ! You give everybody money ! You 're to blame ! ( makes a swift gesture ) Bing ! Off to the corner  --  the door open ? O'HIGGINS Were n't you here ? p. 91 LUPE Nobody was here ! Only his mother --  there . ( points to balcony ) O'HIGGINS His mother saw it ! LUPE Never saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) The do nt know nothing  --  never saw nothing --  just Tony -- dead ! Oh . O'HIGGINS ( painfully ) What of her , Lupe ? what about her --  now ?

O'HIGGINS A refuge , Lupe ! - a refuge from the night - open all night - to the end of the night ! That 's where I was waiting , Lupe . In a place to go in out of the night - a place to get rest and strength - and joy - and  --  LUPE ( coldly ) A place to get a drink . O'HIGGINS Yes , Lupe ! Think of that , Lupe ! - all that ! in a drink ! LUPE ( suspicious ) Were you alone in there ? p. 93 O'HIGGINS No ! That 's why I went in - not to be alone . LUPE Who were you with ?

O'HIGGINS Ah ! You know him . Yes . That is my brother Bum - and that 's my brother Drunk - and that 's my brother Laden  --  LUPE Laden ? O'HIGGINS Yes . Heavy Laden is his full name , but we just call him Laden - for short . See Lupe , see his pack ? He 's come down from the mountains - with his pack on his back  --  ( shows more sketches ) And that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my little sister - and my little brother . See , Lupe , how they stand there - hand-in-hand before that table . They want a peso . Our mother sent them out to get a peso . p. 94 LUPE How ? O'HIGGINS How do any of us get a peso , Lupe ? We sell ourselves - that 's how we get a peso . ( another sketch ) And that , Lupe , is my mother . LUPE ( turning away toward her door ) That 's just an old woman selling a pencil . O'HIGGINS A pencil ? That ? That she sticks out from her rags ? No - Lupe ! That is a sign ! - a secret sign ! She makes it to us - we others - so we know we belong . ( stuffs all the papers back in his pockets ) I am going to make a picture of all this , Lupe - as soon as I am rested I will make a picture . ( Lupe bored and angry goes into her room - he goes on to himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red - red as hot iron ! No - dark - the power of darkness ! Better - a pale sulphur - a devil 's furnace of pale sulphur ! with a little blue and green in it . One can be terrible with a little blue and green , Lupe ! And the figures ! - all these figures - the room must be crowded - and yet look empty ! That is my main problem , Lupe ! - a small room - small to suffocation - crowded to suffocation ! - and yet the feeling must be emptiness ! Empty ! Empty ! ( He suddenly sees Cristina come out of her room - she comes along the balcony - and down the stairs- he gets to his feet . Cristina comes to O'Higgins and he to her. ) p. 95 MORA ( holding out an envelope ) Here , Senor . Here is the money you gave me. ( as he hesitates ) Take it , please . O'HIGGINS ( taking it ) Had you no need of it ? MORA I had enough for what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need money now . ( she turns back toward the stairs ) O'HIGGINS Where are you going ? ( as she makes no answer ) Back into your room - alone ? MORA Yes . O'HIGGINS Stay here with me ! MORA What do you want to say to me ? O'HIGGINS Nothing ! ( nods toward the fountain ) We will just sit here - side by side - and say - nothing . MORA It is cold in the patio now . O'HIGGINS It is colder up there . The air is thinner higher up - too thin for a woman like you . Stay down here - with me . MORA It 's dark - the sun has gone . ( strangely ) The sun has gone - my son - gone ! Sinforosa comes on from Evelyn 's room . She crosses to the outer door . p. 96 SINFOROSA ( scolding to herself ) A trunk as big as a house ! - everything strewn around - I 'm going to get Herculano to pack it for her - if he 's sober enough ! ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - indicating the place where Tony died ) He died there ! - like - like nothing . ( crying out ) Why was he born - just to die - like nothing ? O'HIGGINS What can I say to you ? SINFOROSA ( turning at the outer door ) You can tell her to pray . O'HIGGINS To what ? SINFOROSA To God - for mercy - for  --  MORA ( crying out ) Mercy ? O'HIGGINS God has gone from us , Senorita . For mercy now - we have only each other . ( he picks up Lupe 's blanket - puts it on the edge of the fountain ) Sit here , Madame ! Rest ! Sinforosa goes . MORA ( still standing ) Rest ? O'HIGGINS Yes . You must rest . And then you must go . p. 97 MORA Go where ? O'HIGGINS Anywhere - away from here . MORA I can not leave here ! O'HIGGINS Then you will always be sick . MORA Here is all I have . O'HIGGINS Do you want to be sick ? MORA I want to die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ask me that ? O'HIGGINS Because you have lost your son ? No ! It is not grief alone that is killing you . That you could bear - even that ! - bravely . It is something more - what ? ( Cristina makes no answer - starts toward the stairs . He looks after her - then ) They have not found the murderer ? He is not brought to justice ? MORA ( turning ) No . O'HIGGINS Is it that same one ? MORA Yes . O'HIGGINS Not taken ? MORA No . O'HIGGINS No clue ? No  --  p. 98 MORA ( crying out ) Nothing ! No trace ! Nothing ! He is free ! O'HIGGINS Too clever ! Too ruthless ! ( as she turns to the stairs again ) It is because he has triumphed that you do not want to live , Madame ! Not the murdering gun but its triumph ! Yes ! that is your sickness - that is why you want to die ! ( she turns and looks at him ) But we are all dying of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruelty - hypocrisy , lying -  --  everywhere ! MORA ( pause - then ) Has God gone from the world ? O'HIGGINS Law is gone - justice - gone - right - gone . MORA Have we nothing left to cling to ? O'HIGGINS Maybe there is something within us ! MORA There is nothing within me - but emptiness . O'HIGGINS ( nods ) Emptiness - emptiness at the heart . ( looks at her pityingly ) I can fill it with work most of the time . But you ! - what can save you - make you want to live ? ( Cristina does not answer - turns away again ) p. 99 O'HIGGINS What are the police doing ? MORA ( apathetic ) The police ? O'HIGGINS Did n't they come ? Did n't they  --  MORA Yes ! They came . O'HIGGINS And you told them ? MORA Everything I knew . O'HIGGINS Well - what are they doing ? MORA They phone me every day to report - but  --  ( suddenly ) They have nothing to work with ! - nothing ! No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( soothing ) I know . I heard . ( pause - nods to Gilda 's room ) What became of her ? MORA ( indifferent ) She 's gone back - where she came from . O'HIGGINS When did she leave ? MORA That afternoon . O'HIGGINS That afternoon ? MORA She had just gone . O'HIGGINS Is n't that - strange ? p. 100 MORA The police think so - but I think she went to leave my boy alone . O'HIGGINS What do they say ? MORA They think he put her here to spy on us - seduce the boy - and  --  O'HIGGINS Yes ! MORA I do n't believe it ! I ca n't believe in such human depravity ! O'HIGGINS ( slowly ) No - you wouldn't. ( suddenly ) Why did they let her go if  --  MORA She was gone before ! they were here -- by plane . O'HIGGINS Ca n't they bring her back ? MORA Why ? There 's nothing to connect her . O'HIGGINS They can at least have her watched ! MORA ( always apathetic ) They are . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuba . So now they have the idea that he may be going there , too . They are watching all the planes and boats - and  --  O'HIGGINS Do they know what he looks like ? MORA ( nods ) They know he is an Italian - about thirty . p. 101 O'HIGGINS That 's something ! MORA They think he is a secret agent - a spy . O'HIGGINS Of course ! Was n't it as a spy that your husband first  --  MORA My husband was wrong ! He was not a spy then ! O'HIGGINS Then he became one immediately after ! How else would he be able to travel as he does ? Have all the money to - MORA ( to herself ) He was accused of it ! And he became it ! O'HIGGINS Your boy was just one of his objectives -- a personal --  and minor one ! Lupe comes on from her room . She has a reboso over her head - and carries her belongings in a bright woven basket . She walks determinedly toward the zaguan . O'HIGGINS Where are you going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? LUPE I have a business . O'HIGGINS ( astonished ) What business ? LUPE Selling business . ( nods toward radio ) You can keep my other business . ( starts off ) p. 102 O'HIGGINS When will you be back ? LUPE I wo n't be back . O'HIGGINS ( really disturbed ) Because I brought a woman home ! But , Lupe , she was only to paint - I told you  --  LUPE It was n't the woman . O'HIGGINS What then ? LUPE The chicken ! You throw away good chicken ! O'HIGGINS Ah yes ! That 's an excellent reason , Lupe . No woman should stay with a man who throws away good chicken . That is an insult to her special dignity - because it is an insult to life . You are right , Lupe ! You are always right ! You follow your instincts - you  --  Lupe goes out the outer door - closing it vehemently . He stares after her - then turns back - brushes his hand over his eyes . MORA ( surprised ) You weep ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am a little bit drunk . So I can weep if I feel like it ! It is not an offense against manliness - it is merely funny . MORA But you let her go without  --  O'HIGGINS She had to go - that only makes it the more sad for me. p. 103 MORA You laughed at her . O'HIGGINS At myself . MORA ( gently ) You loved her ? O'HIGGINS Loved ? I was fond of her ! I liked her ! And I liked to sleep with her . Is that what you mean by love ? MORA ( as to herself ) My boy asked me that - that day - what I meant by love . O'HIGGINS And did you tell him ? MORA I tried to - but  --  O'HIGGINS No ! You could n't tell him - not then - not yet ! MORA I told him the love I had known . O'HIGGINS ( quickly ) And that did n't satisfy him ! MORA No . O'HIGGINS It was n't enough for him ! MORA No . O'HIGGINS ( almost triumphantly ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low ) I loved my husband . O'HIGGINS Yes ! But some part of you was always outside ! - not used ! not !  --  ( suddenly ) Come with me - and you will know what love is ! p. 104 MORA ( withdrawing ) Come with you ? O'HIGGINS Yes ! MORA Are you mad ? O'HIGGINS I 'll save you , Cristina ! I 'll fill the emptiness at your heart ! I 'll use all of you ! None of you will be outside - crying in the night ! Come with me , Cristina . MORA No ! O'HIGGINS Why not ? Ah yes - you are one of those who can give love - but can not receive it . All right - let it be that way ! - at first ! Give me your love , Cristina . Reconcile me to the world - I have such a homesick longing for a real life . The only home I have ever had has been - in painting . Help me to live ! Give me heart to  --  MORA I ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even to try ? MORA No . O'HIGGINS Then better youdie - decently . Why go on like this - empty of life - chilling the air . Come with me , Cristina . MORA I can not ! O'HIGGINS Why not ? Because you know I live with this girl ? Yes ! I do not believe in your abstinence . I believe in enjoyment ! in use ! I do not want to live dimmed - like you ! Yes , Cristina - dimmed ! When we try to become more than we are - we become less ! p. 105 MORA I know that . O'HIGGINS Then why wo n't you come with me ? Because nobody buys my pictures ! They will , Cristina ! And for a big price ! And soon ! Till now all the people intelligent enough to like my pictures are too poor to buy them - but soon , very soon ! someone will tell the rich ! and then . I can give you a life worthy of you - in every way . MORA It is n't that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Yes ! If the storm inside gets too loud - I drink to drown it ! But not very often ! - mostly I drown it - in work ! And those rare times that I do - I still feel the stars high and clear above me ! It is not dissipation ! And even if it were - it does nothing to destroy me . Loneliness and the unsatisfied need of love - are what really destroy us , Cristina ! MORA I know . But still - O'HIGGINS With you , Cristina ! - it will not be this way ! All this will be over ! All things will become new for me ! I shall become new ! fresh ! good ! strong ! Cristina ! Two people who believe in each other are strong as an army of ten thousand men ! - and when they love ! MORA ( crying out ) I can not ! O'HIGGINS You closed your boy within these walls . Now are you going to wall yourself in , too ? Die here , too ? Imprisioned ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'HIGGINS ( suddenly begins to beat on the stones of the fountain ) Listen ! Do n't you hear me ? I am here ! In the cell next to you . I am knocking on the wall between us . Hear me ! Answer me !  --  No  --  you can not . You are deaf ! - exhausted. ! - frightened ! - frozen ! Let me hold you , Cristina . It will give you warmth ! Close to my body . MORA No ! O'HIGGINS Feel my heart beating . It will give you courage . MORA No . O'HIGGINS Feel arms around you . It will give you rest . MORA ( going swiftly to the stairs ) No ! No ! The phone rings . She turns - comes away from the stairs - goes quickly to the phone . MORA ( at phone - eagerly ) Hello - yes - yes - where ? Now ? Right now ? Yes - yes . ( hangs up - slowly - disturbed - absorbed - speaks half to O'Higgins - half to herself ) He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . O'HIGGINS Where ? MORA At the airport . p. 107 O'HIGGINS Escaping ? MORA ( nods ) Yes . They took him off a plane . O'HIGGINS So ! The guilty is brought to justice ! Now you may get well ! Now - MORA He is not brought to justice yet . ( disturbed - frightened ) I must identify him , theysay ! - so they can hold him ! They are bringing him here - now ! - for that ! O'HIGGINS ( soothing ) Well ? MORA But I did n't see him do it - I did n't see any one ! I --  O'HIGGINS You know he did it ! MORA Yes ! I know . O'HIGGINS Then - identify him . MORA ( more troubled ) But I never saw him - actually - O'HIGGINS You know - he is the man ! MORA Yes ! Yes ! He is the man . O'HIGGINS You want him brought to justice ! MORA ( crying out ) To justice - yes ! O'HIGGINS Then you must identify him ! - or they will let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - O'HIGGINS Think of all the evil he has brought against you ! You have only to say - MORA Oh , Senor  --  please !  --  I can not ! O'HIGGINS You will not ! MORA I must tell the truth ! I - O'HIGGINS In a world full of lies ? MORA There is still some truth to cling to ! You yourself said there was a truth within us - that - O'HIGGINS That is not this kind of truth ! MORA There is only one kind of truth . O'HIGGINS Platitude ! ( bitterly ) And so this murderer - this brutal murderer - is to walk out free - because you - MORA Do not torment me like this - not today - not - O'HIGGINS Today is the day ! Now ! You say he will be here any moment ! MORA ( desperately ) But truth can never be proved by lies ! - no more than goodness can come from evil - or - O'HIGGINS Evil can come from goodness - when that goodness is weakness ! This evil that has made waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goodness !  --  your pity ! You interceded for this man 's life - and now he  --  p. 109 MORA It was not pity ! It was justice ! He was innocent ! O'HIGGINS Then perhaps - now he is guilty . MORA And what has made him guilty ? - injustice ! My husband 's injustice ! A just man - unjust ! And what made him unjust ? Anger ! Hatred ! Fear ! It is a chain of evil ! And I will not add one link - not one ! Let it break ! It must break ! O'HIGGINS When it breaks , the guilty one goes free ! ( bitterly ) O'HIGGINS ( bitterly ) All you good people ! - you 're all alike - vain , fatuous and blind ! You wear armor instead of a knife ! Carry a flag instead of a machine gun ! Retire to your high towers of truth and justice - and leave the world to the ruthless and the wicked ! You must come down from your nobility ! Come down and fight - force , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - bribery with bribery - trickery with trickery - betrayal with betrayal - or you are lest - you and all you want life to be - gone-wiped out - murdered - dead - MORA No - you are wrong - truth can not die - it - O'HIGGINS Words - platitudes ! When truth is murdered it is dead ! - and the dead do not rise - except in myths - and they , too , are dead . p. 110 MORA ( crying out ) No ! Evil can not conquer ! It destroys itself ! - feeds upon itself ! It - O'HIGGINS Not without fight - punishment - destruction ! ( There is a ring of the outer bell ) These they are now ! ( he goes to the outer door - opens it ) Enter SARMONTE and a Detective . Sarmonte is well-dressed and handsome - as always . He seems sure of himself - outwardly - indignant - blustering . But innerly he is quiet - and keenly alert . The Detective is far more uncertain than he is . He is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of himself and the moment - but very insecure about them both . DETECTIVE ( coming in ) Well - Senora - here we are . SARMONTE ( blustering ) What is all this ? What am I - DETECTIVE ( with a gesture of his little fat hand ) Just a moment , Senor . I told you not say anything until we got here . SARMONTE But what I brought here for ? DETECTIVE ( always the same characteristic gesture of the hand ) Now everything will be explained . p. 111 SARMONTE But - DETECTIVE Everything in order . Senor ! - ( getting himself lined up ) Have you ever seen this place before ? SARMONTE Never ! What is all this ! DETECTIVE ( to Cristina ) Is this the man , Senora ? MORA ( who has not taken her eyes off Sarmonte ) Yes ! SARMONTE What man ? What are you trying to - DETECTIVE You are sure , Senora ? MORA Yes . SARMONTE You never saw me in your life before ! DETECTIVE You can swear it was this man ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you sure , Senora ? MORA He swore to kill my boy ! He - SARMONTE ( makes an impatient gesture ) Me ? DETECTIVE You heard him ? You were present , Senora ? MORA No - but I was told ! My husband told me  --  p. 112 DETECTIVE ( important - but patient ) That is just hearsay , Senora . SARMONTE I tell you she never laid eyes- DETECTIVE Is this true , Senora - did you never really see him before this ? MORA ( does not answer ) DETECTIVE You said he tried to kill the boy before - in France ! You said  --  MORA Yes ! DETECTIVE You were present ? You saw him ? MORA No . But I know it was he ! SARMONTE ( makes another disparaging gesture ) DETECTIVE This is no identification , Senora ! This kind of thing ! What can I hold this man on ? O'HIGGINS ( to Cristina ) Madame , you say you know this is the man who murdered your son - shot him down - here ! - viciously - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the law ? MORA ( low ) Because I never actually saw his face - before today - O'HIGGINS But you know - p. 113 SARMONTE ( to Detective ) How long is this going on ? Has n't she made fool of you enough for one day ? DETECTIVE ( makes a helpless gesture ) You are free , Senor . ( goes to the door - turns back to Cristina ) I ca n't do differently , Senora . It is the law . ( opens the door ) Herculano is standing on the threshold - he is very drunk . HERCULANO ( to Detective politely ) With your permission , Senor . ( comes in - sees O'Higgins - embraces him ) Ah , Senor O'Higgins ! My friend ! Home again , Senor . Welcome ! I - ( suddenly sees Sarmonte - goes quickly to Evelyn 's door ) I 'll pack the trunk immediately - the Senorita said to pack the trunk . ( he is about to go into Evelyn 's room ) O'HIGGINS Wait ! Herculano ! Did you ever see this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sure ? The day Tony was killed - before you went off to the corner to drink - did n't you see this man somewhere here ? HERCULANO No , Senor , no ! I never saw anyone here . No one at all - I swear it - Senor ! Herculano off . p. 114 DETECTIVE ( to Sarmonte ) I gegret , Senor , all the molestation we have caused you . SARMONTE ( blustering ) Molestation ! I ca n't get another seat on the plane for days maybe . I - DETECTIVE ( politely ) If you will come with me , Senor - to my chief . Perhaps he can arrange something . He has great influence everywhere and - SARMONTE No , thank you . I 've had enough of your chief 's influence for one day ! DETECTIVE ( bows - his dignity injured ) As you wish , Senor . He goes . ( Sarmonte lights a cigarette to hold back just enough to be rid of him - then starts quickly for the door . ) O'HIGGINS ( suddenly bolts door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is all this ? O'HIGGINS Herculano ! SARMONTE You ca n't hold me here ! O'HIGGINS Herculano ! ( Herculano appears at Evelyn 's door ) HERCULANO ( frightened ) Yes , Senor . p. 115 O'HIGGINS You know this man ! Why did you say you did n't ? HERCULANO No - Senor ! No ! I - O'HIGGINS Why do you lie to me - friend ? HERCULANO Do n't let them put me in jail - Senor ! O'HIGGINS No - just tell me the truth , friend . HERCULANO I did n't mean to steal the gun , Senor  --  I was just keeping it till - O'HIGGINS What gun ? HERCULANO The gun he threw away - in the alley - that day . O'HIGGINS You have his gun ? Where is it ? HERCULANO ( taking it from under his shirt ) Here - Senor - I was just - MORA ( taking it in her hand ) Is that the gun that killed  --  HERCULANO Yes  --  Senora - yes . SARMONTE ( quietly - starting to ard her ) Give me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Evelyn 's room - closes the door ) SARMONTE ( still coming ) Give me that gun . ( Cristina suddenly levels the gun - shoots . Sarmonte takes a step forward - then turns - starts toward the zaguan - falls by the back wall in the shadow . Cristina goes to him - stands over him - firing. ) p. 116 MORA You killed my boy  --  you killed my boy  --  SARMONTE ( lifts himself toward her ) Mama - mama mia.He dies . ( Cristina stands looking down at him . O'Higgins goes to the body - kneels by it . ) MORA ( stonily ) He is dead ? O'HIGGINS Yes . ( he gets up - takes Lupe 's blanket - puts it over the body ) MORA ( crying out ) He killed my boy ! He killed my boy ! O'HIGGINS Yes ! ( he takes the gun from her hand ) MORA ( hysteria ) He killed my boy  --  he  --  O'HIGGINS ( trying to lead her away - toward the stairs ) Come . MORA No ! ( hysteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( throwing his hand off - crying out ) No - no prison - no walls . I am free ! I have killed him ! He is gone ! I am safe ! O'HIGGINS ( soothing ) Yes ! Now you are safe . Enter Sinforosa from the outer door . She has her black veil over her head , and starts to cross from the zaguan to the corridor . p. 117 SINFOROSA ( coming in ) Did Herculano get home ? ( There is no answer . She stands a moment be- wildered by the silence  --  then her eye falls on the figure under the blanket . She thinks it is Herculano ) SINFOROSA Oh - so that 's it ! Well - anyway he got home ! I was afraid he would n't make it alone - but I wanted to stop in church to pray for a little . ( she starts toward the corridor - turns drawing her shawl close ) It 's so cold - should n't we put him in his bed ? O'HIGGINS Let him sleep it off here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two . SINFOROSA ( starting off ) To the corner again - always the corner . ( turns at the entrance of the corridor ) I stopped to pray for you , Senora . To the Holy Mother - to show you her divine mercy - that love may come into your heart again . She goes . MORA ( strangely ) The Holy Mother ? She wo n't answer ! No ! - no love - no mercy - no ! ( crying out ) She wants to revenge her son - like me ! O'HIGGINS ( soothing ) Come , Cristina. p. 118 MORA He called to his mother  --  Mama  --  Mama . ( she goes to Sarmonte - kneels beside him just as she did by Tony ) I am here , son  --  I am here ! O'HIGGINS ( sharply ) Cristina ! - come with me ! MORA We must put him in his bed . He is cold . He is  --  O'HIGGINS Lupe 's blanket is warm . MORA Not warm enough ! He is dead ! I killed him ! O'HIGGINS You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can not leave him ! He is my son ! I killed him ! I killed my son . O'HIGGINS No ! No ! MORA ( strangely ) Who did then ?  --  You ? ( getting to her feet ) Yes  --  you killed him . Yes ! That 's what you said - punishment ! destruction !  --  yes ! - you brought him down to this ! You killed him - you ! O'HIGGINS Yes - yes . Come - MORA ( crazily ) Now they will track you down  --  follow you  --  you will be the hunted one ! You ! And they will find you  --  punish you - kill you ! No ! - they must n't do that !  --  They must n't know ! We must hide it ! Hide it ! Take it away from here ! So they will never know ! We can put it in the alley - where he put the gun  --  Yes , that is the place for it - where he - Come - we 'll carry him out - drag him out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it 's Herculano  --  Come  --  help me  --  it 's heavy  --  too heavy ! Oh - we can never get rid of it - never  --  never ! Enter Sinforosa from corridor . p. 119 SINFOROSA ( to Cristina ) Let him sleep , Senora . ( she starts to cross toward Evelyn 's door ) O'HIGGINS ( sharply ) What is it , Senorita  --  what do you want ? SINFOROSA ( stops - surprised at his tone ) I was just going to pack Mrs. Evelyn 's trunk - now that Herculano is  --  O'HIGGINS Tomorrow . SINFOROSA But she is sending for it tomorrow  --  they may come for it early . O'HIGGINS They are never early . SINFOROSA ( nods ) Always late . O'HIGGINS And you are tired . SINFOROSA ( nods ) Always tired . ( hesitates ) Well  --  good night , Senor . ( she goes toward the corridor ) O'HIGGINS Good night . SINFOROSA ( at the entrance of the corridor ) Good night to you both . She goes . MORA ( crosses to O'Higgins ) The trunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - hide it in that - take it but in that ! p. 120 O'HIGGINS Yes ! MORA Herculano is packing it - we must get him away - we must - O'HIGGINS ( interrupting quickly ) Yes . ( loves toward evelyn 's door - calls ) Herculano ! Herculano ! The door opens a little . Herculano appears . HERCULANO ( hesitating ) Yes , Senor ? O'HIGGINS Come out . He is gone . HERCULANO Is everything all right ? O'HIGGINS Yes . HERCULANO I thought I heard him shooting . O'HIGGINS No . HERCULANO A taxi in the street , I guess . O'HIGGINS A taxi - yes . You can go back to the corner now . HERCULANO But - I have to pack the trunk . O'HIGGINS The Senorita will pack it . HERCULANO Did she say that ? HERCULANO ( crosses hurriedly to the door ) Aiy ! ( turns at the door ) Did n't he leave me anything for keeping his gun for him ? Last time he gave me a peso . p. 121 O'HIGGINS ( taking money out of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( taking it eagerly ) Aiy ! Virtue is always rewarded , Senor . He goes . O'HIGGINS ( crosses quickly to Evelyn 's door - looks in - then swiftly as though to himself ) Yes ! Yes ! ( he goes to outer door - bolts it - turns to Sarmonte 's body - sees Cristina ) Go to your room now ! Get ready to leave . MORA I am going away ? O'HIGGINS Yes . MORA Where ? O'HIGGINS Have you still that paper I gave you that day - for your son ? MORA Yes . O'HIGGINS You are going there . MORA Across the border ? O'HIGGINS Yes . Go to that address and do everything just as I told you . ( he gives her the money that is in the envelope she gave him ) Here ! Take this ! Now ! It was always meant for this . ( she takes it hesitantly ) Go up to your room now and pack what you need . p. 122 MORA ( starts toward stairs - turns ) What are you going to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am going with that . ( kneels beside it - throws back the blanket-looks through the pockets swiftly - Cristina stands watching him - unable to move ) MORA ( low ) Will it be in the trunk ? O'HIGGINS Yes . MORA How will you get it out ? O'HIGGINS ( matter-of-fact ) Call a taxi and take it out - as any trunk ! ( suddenly ) Ah ! Ah ! ( he has found a wallet full of money - he gets to his feet - goes to her with it ) Take this , too . MORA ( recoiling ) No ! O'HIGGINS Yes ! ( as she stares at it - unmoving ) Half then ! - as before ! ( puts half back in his pocket - hands her half ) MORA No ! O'HIGGINS ( grimly ) All right ! I 'll take it ! I may need it - all of it ! ( puts this half in another pocket - turns back to the body ) Go now ! Hurry ! p. 123 MORA ( starts to go - turns back ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it ? Out to the country ? - to a ditch ? O'HIGGINS To the station . ( he is looking in the other pocket ( he takes out overything he finds - puts all of it in a fine white linen handkerchief - knots it - as he goes on talking to her ) . MORA To the railroad station ? O'HIGGINS Yes . MORA But there are many people there ! What will you do with it there ? O'HIGGINS I 'll buy a ticket somewhere - far - and check it there . MORA And then you will go on there and  --  O'HIGGINS No . I shall return here . MORA ( frightened ) Here ? Why ? O'HIGGINS So that tomorrow - when she sends for her trunk - I can  --  MORA How can you explain ? What will you  --  O'HIGGINS Explain nothing !  --  it will be gone ! MORA How ?

" MORA It was like that - ( pause  --  then ) Can one soul speak to another like that ? - silently - like that ? O'HIGGINS Some souls . ( There is a loud hammering on the outer door - and the Detective 's voice is heard calling ) DETECTIVE ( off ) Open the door ! Open  --  O'HIGGINS ( to Cristina ) Go ! Quickly ! You must n't be seen here . ( he goes to her - leads her to the stairs ) MORA ( protesting ) I must stay beside you . I must be with you .

DETECTIVE Ah - O'HIGGINS She went right away - she was very tired . DETECTIVE Poor woman . I feel great sympathy for the Senora . I always feel sympathy for a beautiful woman . But what could I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Law ! O'HIGGINS You acted very correctly . DETECTIVE I felt a great sympathy for him - too - after all - taken off his plane - for nothing ! I wanted to take him to my chief . My chief could have gotten him out again tonight - if the fellow had made it worth his while . ( shrugs - laughs ) But - well - he 's gone . p. 127 O'HIGGINS Too bad . He would have been very grateful to you ! DETECTIVE ( seriously ) That 's what I thought , Senor . That 's why I was waiting . a few extra pesos- , - when a man has a family -- well --  goodnight senor . O'HIGGINS Good night . DETECTIVE ( starts out - walking over the place the body lay - slips a little - looks down ) Ah - what is this here ? Ah - ( takes out a flashlight - follows the trail of blood to the room door - opens it - looks in - then closes the door again - turns back to O'Higgins ) Who did this - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where she has been standing inside by the unclosed door ) I - Senor . DETECTIVE ( surprised ) You ! Senora ? MORA Yes - I - alone - O'HIGGINS It was in self defense ! He - DETECTIVE ( important ) Better you say nothing , Senor - neither one of you ! - nothing !

I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( offers ) DETECTIVE ( taking one ) Thank you . ( O'Higgins lights the cigarette for him - then one for himself . He has become - for the Detective - polite , formal , graceful - full of mutual understanding . ) ( The whole scene that follows must be played with the utmost seriousness . ) DETECTIVE ( with a little smirk ) You are the Senora 's - friend ? O'HIGGINS Her friend ? Oh no - Senor - I can not claim that honor . I am only a lodger in this house - as she is. ( nods to the balcony ) She - there . I - here ! p. 129 DETECTIVE ( smirk ) There are the stairs . O'HIGGINS ( laughs - shakes his finger ) DETECTIVE You are a gentleman , Senor . O'HIGGINS No more than you , Senor .

DETECTIVE No bail for that . ( nods toward Evelyn 's door ) That is the law . O'HIGGINS ( to himself ) God ! And she must suffer this ! after all the other ! Now this !

I am the law . O'HIGGINS The law protects the innocent , Senor . DETECTIVE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - stopped - then begins again ) Will you do me a favor , Senor ? DETECTIVE ( on the defensive ) Anything in my power , Senor , but  --  O'HIGGINS Let me make a picture of you while we are waiting . DETECTIVE A picture ? Me ? O'HIGGINS You . p. 131 DETECTIVE Now ? O'HIGGINS Why not ? We have a long time to wait . You know women ! DETECTIVE ( smirk ) Not as well as you , Senor . O'HIGGINS Just a sketch . ( he takes a piece of paper from his pocket - feels the Detective 's disappointment ) From this I will make the picture later - if you wish me to - O'HIGGINS a big picture - very big . ( impressively ) I will call it - The Law . DETECTIVE ( flattered ) My picture ? O'HIGGINS ( nods ) Are n't you the Law ? ( as Detective takes a pose ) Fine , Senor ! Great ! The chin just a little higher - good . ( draws rapidly ) DETECTIVE ( after a pause - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I talk , Senor ? O'HIGGINS Of course you can talk ! Are n't you the law !

DETECTIVE You must be a big artist then . O'HIGGINS Who knows ? DETECTIVE ( convinced ) Very big . ( pause ) I guess you won . O'HIGGINS Won ?

( takes out money from his pocket ) See ? DETECTIVE That 's a lot of money - for a picture . O'HIGGINS Yes - a lot of money . With this money I can buy myself a lot of the things I 've been wanting - I can buy a gold ring . DETECTIVE ( eagerly ) With a diamond ! O'HIGGINS A big diamond ! And if I do n't want to pay for it all at once - many things besides ! For myself ! and my family !

DETECTIVE ( starts to smile - then quickly is serious again ) O'HIGGINS ( nods towards evelyn 's door ) I was just about to put that miserable nothing in a trunk in there - and take it away ! No one would ever have known anything about it - if you had n't been waiting outside ! DETECTIVE Too smart - eh ? O'HIGGINS Yes ! Smart - then ! But --  ( serious ) Are you smart now ? smart enough ? DETECTIVE ( on the defensive - but eager ) What do you mean , Senor ? O'HIGGINS Smart enough to let me finish the job ? ( quickly ) You never came back here ! It is as simple as that ! DETECTIVE ( considering ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 135 O'HIGGINS She will never tell ! O'HIGGINS ( as he hesitates ) It 's her own skin ! Her own  --  DETECTIVE ( dismissing it firmly ) Even so . I ca n't trust her . She is too honest . ( pause - as O'Higgins goes on drawing ) If there was another - remedy - Senor . O'HIGGINS ( quickly ) There is ! A very simple remedy ! DETECTIVE ( uneasy - but always eager ) What ? O'HIGGINS ( shrugs ) Let her go . DETECTIVE Now ? O'HIGGINS Yes ! DETECTIVE But - O'HIGGINS You are the law ! DETECTIVE But the body , Senor ! Who ? O'HIGGINS You ! You are the law ! If the law puts a few bullets in a prisoner attempting to escape - what is that ? It happens every day !

O'HIGGINS And they are the same bullets that killed the boy ! ( gives him the gun ) It all ties up ! - perfectly . DETECTIVE ( nods as though agreeing - then suddenly ) I ca n't do it , Senor . ( puts the gun in his pocket - a little slyly ) I 'll keep this - as evidence - but - ( makes a helpless gesture ) O'HIGGINS I thought you were smart ! ( begins to draw ) p. 137 DETECTIVE ( wetting his lips ) I regret , Senor . I regret deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say no more about it . ( goes on drawing - then ) Your chief is a rich man - no ? DETECTIVE A very rich man , Senor . O'HIGGINS And a smart man . DETECTIVE ( shrugs ) As to that  --  O'HIGGINS Smart enough to see an opportunity when it offers . DETECTIVE That yes , Senor . O'HIGGINS ( as Detective makes a gesture ) And courageous ! Courageous enough to take a chance when it comes - And a man of heart ! Heart is the important thing in life , Senor . DETECTIVE True , Senor . O'HIGGINS ( nods ) As soon as the Senora can talk to him - in private  --  No - the Senora has nothing to fear but a little inconvenience . DETECTIVE ( slyly ) A great inconvenience , perhaps . O'HIGGINS Perhaps - but - p. 138 DETECTIVE One I would like to avoid for her ! O'HIGGINS You are a man of heart , too , Senor . DETECTIVE If there was only a way - without too great - inconvenience . O'HIGGINS Take the phone ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone and report it in now . DETECTIVE ( hesitant ) Now ? O'HIGGINS Now !

( in phone - vigorously ) Martinez speaking . Give me the chief ! O'HIGGINS No doubt he will reward you . ( the Detective wets his lips ) Very shortly - just what happened - he attacked her - you did your duty . ( he suddenly sees Cristina who has come along the balcony - and now starts down the stairs  --  she carries a little worn travelling bag - wears a coat - and has a veil over her head - O'Higgins makes a sign to the Detective to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs ) p. 139 DETECTIVE ( speaking in phone as Cristina is on the stairs ) Hello - Chief ? I just killed a man over here - you know - that killer ! ( he goes on talking ) O'HIGGINS You were quick , Cristina . MORA Everything was ready - my bag - packed that day to go with Tony . ( struggling for control ) I was already - to go away with Tony . O'HIGGINS ( soothing ) And now you are going there  --  alone . MORA ( bewildered ) Where ? O'HIGGINS ( firmly ) There - to that place where you were going with Tony . MORA What are you trying to ell me ? O'HIGGINS ( turning - seeing the Detective bang up the phone ) The law has absolved you , Madame . MORA The law ? O'HIGGINS ( makes a gesture toward the Detective ) Yes . The law is setting you free ! Free in person ! and - in conscience , Madame . MORA ( enormous relief ) I knew justice would triumph in the end ! p. 140 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand ) Justice is for the Gods , Senora . They do not work as we . MORA ( sincerely and simply ) You have said a very great truth , Senor . O'HIGGINS Come , Madame . You must go now . I will put you in a taxi . MORA Thank you . ( moves toward outer door - turns ) Thank you both - from my heart . ( goes to door - O'Higgins opens it for her - the light from a street lamp shines there - she starts out - turns back to O'Higgins with sudden desperation ) Come with me . O'HIGGINS Yes ! Yes , Cristina ! I will come with you ! ( comes swiftly in from the zaguan - goes to Detective - gives him money from one pocket ) DETECTIVE ( taking it without seeming to - nods toward Cristina waiting at the open door ) You fooled me , Senor . O'HIGGINS I ? Never ? ( seriously ) It is new for me. ( joyously ) All new . ( starts back to the door ) DETECTIVE ( watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door ) Come , Cristina. ( suddenly cries out ) You in that luminous light ! - that radiance ! - of the good ! He has closed the door after them . They are gone.The curtain begins to fall.The Detective stands alone in the shadow holding his money .
