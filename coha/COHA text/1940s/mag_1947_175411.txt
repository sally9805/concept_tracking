PROUD DESTINY ( 625 pp. ) - Lion Feuchtwanger-Viking ( $3.50 ) . <P> This is another novel whose success is as predictable as next year 's Democratic majority in Tuscaloosa , Ala . Screen rights to this novel of 18th Century France sold for $350,000 last May ; it is the Literary Guild choice for October , and thus sure of sales in the hundreds of thousands . To these rewards , critical acclaim is not likely to be added on the same scale . Proud Destiny resembles War and Peace in the general aim of treating great events ( in this case France 's part in the American Revolution ) in terms of the people who enact or suffer them . The resemblance does not go much beyond that . <P> A first-rate historical novel represents a strong and magical act of imagination : a great deal of learning may have gone into it , but the scaffolding has then been removed . Thackeray 's Henry Esmond and Robert Graves 's I , Claudius put the reader in the presence of the past ; Proud Destiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sixty-three-year-old Lion Feuchtwanger is a professional hand at this and a capable one . Writing in pre-Hitler Germany , he used medieval material in The Ugly Duchess , 18th Century Germany in Power ( his first U.S. success ) , 1st Century Rome in his Josephus trilogy . He has worked on Proud Destiny in Santa Monica , where he settled after fleeing Europe in 1940 , and the novel smells faintly of the Hollywood atmosphere in which it was composed . The period sets are painstaking , the main characters are photogenic . With no strain on his attention , the reader can savor from one large dish a thousand tidbits of 18th Century custom &; morality that he would otherwise have to root for in the garden of biography and memoirs . <P> The two principal and contrasting figures are the French adventurer and comedy writer , Beaumarchais ( he wrote The Barber of Seville ) , who procured arms for the Continental Army , and the 71-year-old sage , Benjamin Franklin , first Minister to France . Feuchtwanger does best at picturing Franklin 's patient and crafty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printing his bagatelles of satire on his own hand press , enjoying his hot bath in a lidded tub of his own design ( on which visitors could sit while he soaked ) , gravely carrying on his gallantries with French women and using his popularity to best advantage for his country . <P> By comparison , the character of Beaumarchais remains a paper doll . So do most of Feuchtwanger 's supporting players : the pretty Hapsburg queen , Marie Antoinette , with her " Lilac Coterie " of expensive courtiers ; the fat and timorous king , who hated rebels on principle ; and various noblemen , courtesans , and intriguers of Versailles . The dying Voltaire comes up from Ferney to see his play , Irene , and to give Feuchtwanger a crack at him , too .
