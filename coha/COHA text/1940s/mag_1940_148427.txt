J. as soon as Swarthmore finds someone to fill his shoes ( TIME , Oct. 23 ) , made his last report to his board of managers , reviewed his 19 Swarthmore years . <P> Dr. Aydelotte had many homely achievements to report . He had rebuilt the bathrooms in old Wharton Hall , mapped the maze of pipes , wires , sewer mains , heating conduits under the campus . He had closed the college laundry and farm , saved money by buying eggs and sending the laundry out . He could truly boast that he had a good-looking campus , one of the most beautiful in the U. S. In a few weeks its apple and cherry trees and its 150,000 daffodil bulbs will begin to blossom . But his principal achievement was what he had done to Swarthmore . <P> Dr. Aydelotte had kept Swarthmore ( opened in 1869 ) a small , coeducational college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 731 , although it could be three or four times as big if he took all applicants .

Unknown at Swarthmore are long , irksome hours of practice , subsidization of athletes . Swarthmore boys and girls play games for fun - two-thirds of them represent their college in intercollegiate sports , on varsity , junior varsity or sub-junior varsity teams .
