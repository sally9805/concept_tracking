In a Delaware Federal court last week , Judge John Biggs Jr . stared thoughtfully at a demonstration of spiral waves , " croquignole " waves , the grotesque spindles , rolls , clamps and gadgets used in 83,000 U. S. beauty shops to help straight-haired women outwit nature . If the display looked frivolous , the lawsuit behind it was not : at stake was some $6,000,000 . <P> The croquignole process , which revolutionized permanent waves by the simple device of winding the hair around curlers from the tips instead of from the scalp , was patented in the ' 20s by a Czech named Josef Mayer . In the U. S. , Mayer 's patents are controlled by the Philad Co. , which once licensed equipment manufacturers and collected royalties of at least $80.000 a year . But in 1939 a Federal court ruled that , since the manufacturers did not themselves use the croquignole process , they were exempt from royalties . Thereupon Philad began an attempt to collect $12-up a year from virtually every beauty shop in the land . Possible Philad take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hence . <P> Philad 's demand made beauty operators ' hair stand right on end . A court test promptly was sought by the National Hairdressers ' &; Cosmetologists ' Association ( 14,000 members ) , headed by able St. Louis Businesswoman Edna L. Emme . Miss Emme 's claims : the croquignole process had been used in the U. S. before the Mayer patent ; the patent was issued improperly ; by purchasing machines from licensed manufacturers , the operators had bought the right to use the process anyway . At week 's end , Judge Biggs took the case under advisement , started combing out the kinks.
