txt David Lloyd George will celebrate in a few days the completion of fifty years of continuous service in the House of Commons . We Americans , who love records of all kinds , will want to send our good wishes across the Atlantic for this democratic jubilee . What a record his has been ! He entered Parliament when Gladstone was still Prime Minister . Benjamin Harrison was President over here ; Bismarck had just been dismissed as German Chancellor , but Blitzkrieg and all its horrid implications had not yet entered the Anglo-Saxon consciousness . Hitler was still painting houses in Vienna when this " pluto-democrat " from Wales , this product of British " decadence , " was putting through the most stupendous program of social legislation in Europe 's history . His program - saved Britain from trouble in later years ; the sons and grandsons of Lloyd George 's enemies of 1909 will admit it today . And although the Conservatives still dislike him , they still honor him as the organizer of resistance , the father of victory , in the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All these years he has stayed on in the House of Commons , a nuisance to Tory Ministers , a delight to the galleries , a prodigy of physical and mental energy . Half a century in Parliament has made him an Elder Statesman , but not for one moment a ghost of some dead past . No ghost could have such pink cheeks , such a perky manner . They say his speeches were more effective in the old days ; but the House fills up to hear him even now , and there is a dead hush in the chamber whenever he stands there , scolding , prodding , ridiculing , tossing his white mane in anger , or wagging an accusing finger at Mr. Chamberlain across the floor . Only Winston Churchill can match him in holding the House in the hollow If his hand . He gives the impression , at times , of enough energy to sweep the whole Cabinet into the dustbin . How he would like to do it if the voters gave him the chance ! But the voters will have none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changeable , for the public taste . In recent weeks he has outdone his own record of intellectual somersaults ; for he has warned against war with Russia , and almost in the next breath has cried " Too late ! too late ! " because the Government did not disregard his warnings and send an . expeditionary force to Finland . Yet he is still applauded whenever he appears on . English movie screens . His real interest today , as an apple farmer in Surrey , is the development of British food-growing ; and as a sentimental tribute it probably would be popular , though inconceivable , if Mr. Chamberlain were to appoint him Minister of Agriculture with wartime powers . There just is no rational way of explaining this man . . They always called him the Welsh Wizard , long before any one thought he would stay in Parliament for fifty years . He must have been descended from Merlin the Magician . It is hard to think of him as a veteran of fifty years , but still harder to imagine British politics without him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
