At last America 's war with Japan has made us free to act . Now we shall see what our U-boats may achieve-Adolf Hitler last week . <P> The Canadian liner Lady Hawkins skittered across a slick , black ocean . Scarcely 100 yards away a U-boat reared up out of the sea for the brief space of 60 seconds . The raider fingered the Lady coldly with a pair of searchlights . Then the Lady Hawkins shuddered under the impact of a torpedo . Her forward mast crashed . Over on her side careened the 7,988-ton liner . Passengers and crew tumbled into the sea . A second torpedo exploded in the Lady Hawkins ' engine room and her career ended . <P> One lifeboat got away . Somehow 76 people , some in night clothes , hair matted with oil , managed to scramble into it or were pulled up from the sea . It was built to carry only 63 . Jammed in so tightly that they could not sit down , they floated wretchedly through the rest of the night and into the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were mornings after mornings . Five died , pleading for coffee or water . They were dropped into the sea . <P> Daily rations were one biscuit , one-quarter of a cup of water , two teaspoonfuls of condensed milk . The youngest , and one of the most stoical , of the forlorn voyagers was two-year-old Janet Johnson . <P> Her father , a British foreign service attache , had paddled away from the sinking Lady Hawkins with Janet in his arms and his wife struggling beside him . When Janet became feverish , Chief Officer Kelly gave her a spoonful of brandy . Janet began to laugh . Her shipmates laughed with her-the only time they laughed . Most of the time they prayed . For five days the little company floated on the Atlantic , until the S.S. Coamo spotted them . <P> The Coamo put them ashore in San Juan , Puerto Rico . As far as was known at week 's end , they were the only survivors of the Lady out of some 300 who had been aboard . Among the missing : 27 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mo. , who had jumped at an opportunity to go to Bermuda on a construction job . Shocked , St. Joe 's News-Press cried out a curse on submarines : " May the U-boat that struck by stealth , bringing death to more than a score of St. Joseph citizens , meet with such a fate . . . . Before the sinking of the Lady Hawkins this would have seemed a savage and un-American wish . " <P> In two and a half weeks the reported toll of submarine operations along the East Coast was twelve ships , some 350 lives . The day the Lady Hawkins ' fate became known coast guardsmen landed at Chincoteague , Va . a handful of near-dead seamen , survivors of the torpedoed tanker Francis E. Powell . Reports that two Axis subs are operating in the Gulf of Mexico brought a complete blackout along 100 miles of Texas coast . The success of counter-measures was the Navy 's own secret . Just one hint was allowed to slip through . The Navy released a terse report of one unnamed flyer : " Sighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
