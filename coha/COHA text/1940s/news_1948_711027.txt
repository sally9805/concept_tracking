txt Senator Robert A. Taft , Republican leader on domestic matters and a candidate for his party 's Presidential nomination , - oday spoke out his views on the European Recovery Program . Mr. Taft said that the $6,800 , - 000,000 asked for the first fifteen months of the program was too high ; that he did not think the April 1 deadline must be met and that he believed the program should be run by an independent administrator with Cabinet rank . Mr. Taft asserted he believed that the ** estimated for the four-year program was also higher than needed . " The Marshall Plan in effect proposes that we increase our exports to Europe by about $3,000 , - 000,000 during the next twelve months , and I do n't think we can do that and maintain a stable economy in this country , " Mr. Taft said . " How much can we afford to give ? " he asked . " How much is really going to do Europe any good , and how much is going to do this country harm ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a radio discussion broadcast over the National Broadcasting System . With him on the program were Calvin B. Hoover , a member of the President 's Committee- ( Harem- a committee ) nr . Foreign Aid , and Walter Johnson of the university 's History Department . Part Payment Demanded Mr. Taft 's statements were a , leading development of the day which also was marked by a demand by members of both parties in the House Foreign Affairs Committee that the United States receive strategic materials as part payAnt for ERP funds and goods . Mr. Taft said that " we have had two or three deadlines laid down in Congress and we did n't follow them , and when we got there we seem to have gotten there in plenty of time . " He cited the loan to Greece , which was not passed intil sixty days after the deadline , as a case where " it did n't make any particular difference , " and concluded : 1 " I do n't think there is any dead ' fine . " " This is going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will get , " the Ohioan said . " It wo n't be much for the first three I months , and I think there is enough in the temporary plan ( the interim aid approved last month ) pretty well to carry the European nations to the first of July . " For Cabinet Discussions Mr. Taft said he agreed with the Harriman committee report 's recommendation on administra. tion . This report proposed an independent administrator with an independent force in each country in Europe working with him and , to some extent subject to at least the information of the American ambassador in that country , but independent of the State Department . But Senator Taft said he would go further and put the administrator into the Cabinet , " where he can sit with the President , with the Secretary of State , with the Secretary of Commerce . " " I want a man who is looking in each case at our economy as much as he is looking at the advantage that goes to foreign countries . " The ERP , as proposed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Secretary of State Marshall , would have an administrator under the State Department 's direction . This plan has been widely criticized and many observers now believe that the State Department will have to withdraw consiuel aly in working out a compromise that the Con .. gr:ss will accept . In another broadcast , over the Columbia Broadcasting System , Senator Owen Brewster , Republi- can , of Maine , also called for administration by a " competent and responsible authority outside the State Department who shall supervise every dollar of any foreign aid to make sure no politicians at home or abroad shall , in the words of Winston Churchill , ' fritter it away in indulgences not indispensable to recovery . ' " He appeared with Dean Acheson , former Under-Secretary of State , who said that our safety and that of the United Nations was weakened if any of the ERP nations " are weakened and fall by internal action or external pressure into the close police , military and economic system which stretches from Poland to the Pacific . " Another to comment today on ERP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who wondered if the " gigantic task " might impair United States solvency . In a broadcast interview over Station WEAy , Mr. Byrd said that this country 's soundness was the world 's only hope . Without it , he said , " there would be no bulwark against communism , and freedom could not survive here or elsewhere . " Also evidenced today was a demand shared by some members of both parties in the House Foreign Affairs Committee that the assisted countries guarantee that the United States get strategic minerals and oth r materials in exchange for aid .
