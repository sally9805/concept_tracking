Eleven competitors lined up for the race , but the 17,000 foot-racing fans , sizzling in the stands at New York 's Triborough Stadium , had eyes for only two . One was chunky , pony-gaited Gregory Rice , taking time off from his duties as chief petty officer at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point , L.I . to defend the championship he had won for five successive years . The other : gaunt , gazelle-gaited Gunder Hagg ( pronounced Hegg ) , the touted Swedish fireman who was making his U.S. debut in the national 5,000-meter run . <P> On form , things looked none too good for Greg Rice . " Gunder the Wunder , " a self-coached runner , had smashed seven world 's records ranging from 1,500 to 5,000 meters in 90 days last year . His time for 5,000 meters ( 3 miles , 188 yards , 2 inches ) was 13 min. 58.2 sec . The fastest 5,000 Rice had ever run was 14:33.4 . <P> The Race . Rice seldom sets the pace . Neither does Hagg . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lean Gunder decided to take the lead . A youngster named Wilt spurted past Hagg once , passed him again . But Hagg refused to be annoyed . With effortless ease he glided over the cinders , his fringe of long hair flapping , his voluminous shorts billowing like a spinnaker . <P> Now &; again he turned his head to see how he was doing . Rice , pumping along with his peculiar heel-pounding gait , fell farther &; farther back . <P> At the mile he was 6 yards behind . At two miles there were 60 yards between them . Gunder Hagg could not be caught . His time ( 14:48.5 ) was not for the record books . But his racing stride was something never to be forgotten . <P> The Winner . Ever since Gunder Hagg arrived in the U.S. two weeks ago he has confounded U.S. sportswriters . He speaks only a few English words , but at his first press interview , he gave the sportswriters knuckle raps aplenty . <P> When one asked how he happened to become a runner , Hagg looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Ask him how he happened to become a sportswriter . " Another asked : " What are your duties as a fireman ? " Replied tart Gunder Hagg : " I put out fires . " He calmly announced that he expected to break no records while in the U.S. because he was past his peak ( at 24 ) - " and that 's the time to become a sportswriter , when you 're past your peak . " <P> At Hanover , N.H. , where he retired so that he could lope through its wooded hills , he put a " Private " sign on his door in the Dartmouth College Field House . He ate such unorthodox foods as fried scallops before going out for a two-mile jaunt . He made friends with a local Swedish-speaking minister , told a visiting newshawk that he liked the minister " because he ca n't put what I say into the Bible . " <P> After last week 's race , the men in the press box were ready to forgive Hagg all this puckery humor . In awed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patter barefoot over the scorching concrete of the stadium to the broadcasting booth . There , impassive as a totem pole , he stood before a microphone , said hello to his countrymen back home .
