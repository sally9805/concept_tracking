RUMANIA PRESENTS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF the meaning of Hitler 's " new European order . " Here is a country occupied by German troops , governed by men nominated and controlled by Berlin , that has been allowed to fall into a state of organized anarchy . Hitler can not disclaim responsibility . The Iron Guard , which has usurped the functions of the police and instituted a reign of terror , is an organization inspired , fostered , and financed by the Nazis . Its killings are not the result of blind blood-lust but are carefully calculated . The prisoners shot in macabre ceremony over the open grave of Zelea Codreanu , himself the apostle of political assassination , are alleged to have been responsible for his murder . For other slayings there is not even this excuse . The victims include some of the most respected citizens of Rumania , the two most notable being Nicolas Iorga , famous historian , and Virgil Madgearu , economist and secretary of the Peasant Party . Their only crime was that they were anti-Nazi . Germany now has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time seems ripe may openly take over the government . But anarchy let loose is not easy to canalize General Antonescu seems to have lost all authority , and the Iron Guard itself is split into factions , with its Green Shirt being used as a cloak for looting and private vengeance . Now an effort is being made to restore unity by playing up the Transylvania question . In his speech at Alba Julia , Antonescu talked of recovering the lands lost through the Dictate of Vienna . Hungarian reactions were sharp , and the enmity of the two newest Axis partners can not be disguised . THE PROGRAM OF GIVING ENGLAND ALL AID short of war made a giant stride with the resignation of Joseph P. Kennedy as Ambassador to London An ardent champion of appeasement at the time of the Munich pact , Kennedy has since shown somewhat less flexibility on the subject than was displayed by the late Neville Chamberlain . Widespread reports that since his return to the United States Kennedy has been assuring everyone within earshot that England is through gained startling credibility when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview with the Ambassador by Louis M. Lyons of the Boston Globe . According to Mr. Lyons , Mr. Kennedy remarked that " democracy is finished in England " and " it may be here , " that the appointment of Labor leaders to the British Cabinet spelled national socialism for England even if it won , and that talk of England 's fighting for democracy was " the bunk . " Even more remarkable was Mr. Kennedy 's disavowal of the interview , in which he expressed his indignation and annoyance at Mr. Lyons 's betrayal of an off-the-record confidence and vaguely charged him with " inaccuracy , " but repudiated no single statement attributed to him . Kennedy has since branded oc " nnncence " rerwl-c that- by bac keen making anfi -- 1 " British statements , but he is careful to utter no word of hope or confidence in England and has announced his devotion to " the greatest cause in the world today " ? that of keeping this country out of the war . Mr. Kennedy 's appointment in London was inept , and his continuance at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an appalling blunder . His defeatist talk , calculated to discourage effective aid to Britain , appears to be rooted in a preference for the national socialism that Berlin would inflict on England over the " national socialism " which he painfully senses in the pronouncements of Labor Minister Ernest Bevin . THE $100,000,000 CREDIT GRANTED TO CHINA by the United States is an overwhelming answer , both diplomatic and practical , to Japan 's recognition of its puppet Nanking regime . With traffic moving over the Burma road without interruption from Japanese bombing planes , the $100,000,000 can soon be transformed into planes , trucks , and other vital sinews of war for Chiang Kai-shek 's armies . Although the amount is only one-half of that asked for , it is four times as large as has ever before been granted to China . Japan 's recognition of the Wang Ching-wei government could only have importance if it brought about further support for Wang either within China or among foreign nations . It has Published weekly and copyright , 1990 ? In the U S A by The Nation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Y. Entered as second-class matter , December 13 , 1879 , at the Post Office of New York , N Y , under the act of March 3. 1879. 546 done neither . Chiang Kai-shek 's prestige among the people of China in both the occupied and unoccupied sections is higher than ever before . And significantly enough , no other country has so far followed Japan 's example in recognizing Wang . It is particularly interesting to observe that not even Germany and Italy ? Japan 's partners in aggression  --  were sufficiently impressed by the hoax to extend recognition to Wang 's paper regime . * JAPAN 'S CAUTION DESPITE UNPRECEDENTED opportunities for southward expansion continues to baffle many observers . Tokyo has protested against alleged discrimination in the Dutch East Indies and has brought pressure on Indo-China for new bases which would be useful in carrying out its avowed ambitions in the South Seas . But in a most uncharacteristic manner it continues to rely on diplomatic rather than military pressure . Some weeks have now passed since the evacuation of Japanese forces from Kwangsi and Shantung , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the troops remain concentrated at Formosa and Hainan , their commanders unwilling or unable to take advantage of the situation . This does not mean that the threat has lifted . On the contrary , it appears that the Indo-China authorities may surrender Saigon and make other important concessions without a struggle . Much of Japan 's caution , however , is clearly due to apprehension regarding American policy . Reports of further important conversations between Under Secretary Welles and Ambassador Oumansky have doubtless had a sobering effect on the Tokyo militarists. * ALTHOUGH DEFENSE SPENDING IS STILL IN its preliminary stages it is already providing a tremendous stimulus to all forms of economic activity . More goods are being moved by the railroads , new plants are being erected and old plants refurbished , steel production continues at near-capacity and a dozen other industries are breaking all output records , factory employment is mounting , and the increase in consumer incomes is being reflected in rising retail business . The New York Times index of business activity for the week ending November 23 jumped sharply to 117 , thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 114.8 for the week ending June 29 , 1929 . National income is also getting within hailing distance of the 1929 level and in terms of goods and services is undoubtedly higher . The total for the current year is now estimated at $74 billion , compared with $781/2 billion in 1929 . It is true that this year 's income must provide for a population some 7 per cent greater than in 1929 , but this is more than compensated for by the greater purchasing power of the dollar . The fact that economic well-being is increasing not merely in spite of but because of exThe NATION penditures which represent sheer economic waste is a paradox producing many headaches . The fact is that prior to the inception of the rearmament program we were failing to use something like 20 per cent of our potential productive capacity . In the coming year we may devote as much as half of that unemployed margin to defense purposes , but in so doing we shall create new purchasing power and make possible an additional rise in the total output of goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of abundance which , if thoroughly digested , can save us from the dreaded post-emergency depression . * A TROUBLED YEAR SEEMS TO HAVE COME TO an end in Mexico with the inauguration of Avila Camacho . His task will not be easy , but the fact that Henry Wallace , " good neighbor " par excellence , was chosen to represent the United States is the best guaranty that Almazin will attempt no serious insurrection , for the simple reason that it gave notice to his supporters in this country that attempts to foment revolt south of the border will find no sympathy in Washington . Washington 's motive may be the selfish one of hemisphere solidarity and defense , but considering the past , it is a sign of progress in our Latin American policy when we land Henry Wallace instead of the marines . * THE PROPORTION OF SELECTIVE SERVICE registrants who are being rejected as unfit either by the draft-board physicians or the army medical examiners is hardly a good advertisement for the national health . Draft-board doctors in New York City , it is estimated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come before them . And when the remainder are sent on to the army induction centers , where they receive a more rigorous examination , another 20 per cent are found below standard . The chief causes of rejection by the army examiners seem to be bad eyes and bad teeth , and while the causes of the former are largely unknown it is well established that many dental defects can be traced to malnutrition . We have no doubt that the army , needing only a fraction of the men eligible for the draft , is attempting to skim the cream and has devised correspondingly severe tests . Even so , the indication that something like two-thirds of our young men are not in first-class physical condition is disturbing . It is also proof that the best way in which this nation could invest some of its surplus capital would be in a really comprehensive health program . * THE DIFFERENCE IN STANDARDS BETWEEN draft-board and army doctors is causing a good deal of hardship to registrants who are accepted by the first but rejected by the second . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recruit is given five days to resign his job and wind up his affairs . Only then does he have to submit to the final test  --  the army medical examination  --  and if he fails at this stage he finds himself in an awkward vacuum between army and civilian life . A good many men in this predicament are getting back their jobs , but this is not possible in all cases . Moreover , some of those affected are business or professional men who have closed their offices and must suffer loss in getting a new start . It ought to be possible to provide for better coordination between the two medical examinations or , failing this , to allow the draftee his five days of grace after the army doctors have rendered their verdict . * THE WHITE HOUSE TAX CONFERENCE THAT took place last week appears to have evolved a fairly complete and coherent policy for paying the costs of national defense . There will be no further increases in taxation on 1940 incomes , but a substantial boost in taxes is forecast for next year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rearmament on a pay-as-you-go basis , the regular budget will be balanced by a combination of increased taxes and enforced economies . Defense costs will be covered by borrowing , but the loans will be amortized over a definite period of years by the yield from special defense taxes . Although a detailed description of the new taxes is lacking , we have the President 's assurance that a sales tax is not being considered . There is some discussion of strengthening the gift tax and increasing income and excess-profits tax rates still further . All of this is unquestionably in the right direction , but it would be still more encouraging if a real effort were being made to pay the costs of defense , to a considerable extent at least , by increased taxation The burden of such taxes would of necessity fall upon the well-to-do . The money which is raised by loans will also come from this group , but since the loans must be repaid with interest they serve to strengthen the favored position of the wealthy at the expense of the general public . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is bound to lead to rising prices . These difficulties can be avoided by taxing the surpluses of the well-to-do instead of asking that they be lent to the government at a profit . * ONE OF THE DEFENDANTS IN THE FAMOUS Christian Front trials of last spring was Captain John T. Prout , Jr. , accused of conspiring to overthrow the government and to steal munitions from a government armory . Prout was acquitted of the first charge , but the jury disagreed on the second , although he had confessed to having turned over a quantity of ammunition to William Gerald Bishop , a codefendant and alleged ring-547 leader in the plot . The government has not pressed the theft-conspiracy charge , but Prout 's confession compelled the army to bring him before a military tribunal , which has just acquitted him after a trial which was peculiar to say the least . The defendant denied the testimony he had given at his first trial and told his military judges that his confession had been obtained under duress by FBI agents at a time when he had been overworked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Prout 's lawyer had admitted in open court that his client had given Bishop " about $40 worth of ammunition . " The military trial itself proceeded in an atmosphere of fantasy . Two of Prout 's fellow-officers who were called from Alabama to testify for the prosecution reported first to counsel for the defense . Major John J Rhattigan , asked to testify on the stand concerning ammunition-supply records , could offer no help because he had " left his glasses in Alabama . " Ordered to report back at another session , the Major sent the court a telegram saying he had " been ordered back " and could n't come . Rhattigan was cited for contempt , but however cooperative he may decide to become as a result , Front has already been cleared . It is impossible to say whether all this reflects merely the " code of honor " that prevails in army cliques or something more sinister . We should feel easier about the case of Captain Prout if the federal courts would finish their job and bring him again to trial . * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wagon Drivers ' case have come from the Supreme Court in recent years , but none more clearly illustrates the changed character of that tribunal . The unanimous decision , written by Justice Black , indicates that after years of crusading against the evils of the labor injunction we finally have a Supreme Court that is in sympathy with their elimination . The labor provisions of the Clayton Act were meant to end " government by injunction , " but they were nullified by the Supreme Court under Chief Justice Taft . The Norris-LaGuardia Act was passed by Congress in 1932 in an attempt to achieve what the Clayton Act had failed to do . The decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago in the Milk Wagon Drivers ' case demonstrated that judicial interpretation could also emasculate the Norris-LaGuardia Act . The Circuit Court held that this fight of the A. F. of L. milk drivers against a " vendor " system that permitted price-cutting by exploitation of the labor employed was not really a " labor dispute " within the meaning of the Norris-LaGuardia Act . The Circuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cut-rate stores was a secondary boycott and enjoinable under the antitiust laws despite the Norris-LaGuardia Act . These wide loopholes were stopped up by the Supreme Court , which reversed the Circuit Court on both counts .
