Man in the Moon <P> TROPIC MOON-Georges Simenon-Harcourt , Brace ( $2 ) . <P> This book is called by its publishers the first " mature " novel by France 's most famed detective-story writer , the creator of Inspector Maigret . Hot melodrama would be a better term for it . A young , naive Frenchman , Joseph Timar , goes out to work at the Equatorial African trading post of Libreville . At the town 's only hotel , he stares at the grinning masks on the walls , cranks up a phonograph with a big , old-fashioned horn , drinks his first " peg " of whiskey and feels like a young rakehell . The feeling increases when Proprietress Adle comes to wake him , wearing her usual black silk dress and no underclothing . Mutual captivation follows instantly . <P> Within a few days Timar is happily forgetful of his job , drinking heavily , scorning Adle 's obese , mouching husband . And then comes sudden death-to Ad ? e 's husband by fever , to a Negro waiter by an unknown hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband without a tear and persuades the infatuated Timar to use his uncle 's influence to get them a partnership trading concession in the back country . <P> But things crop up to disturb Timar 's sodden conscience . As they travel to their new home , Adle disappears for hours to parley with a native chief . Then she suddenly goes back to Libreville , begging Timar to wait patiently till she returns . But the lonely Timar has learned that Adle herself killed the native waiter , who had seen her leaving Timar 's bedroom and threatened blackmail . He has also found that her parleys with the native chief were to bribe him to fix the murder on an innocent tribesman . She has gone to Libreville to spend the night with the Governor and put him in a good mood for the trial . Deftly , coolly , Author Simenon makes the finale a freezing picture of a colonial court in action . When Timar hurries to court to denounce his mistress , a trader informs him : " Out here white folk hang together . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fate . Timar , half-crazy with his experience , is shipped blathering back to France . <P> At 39 , Georges Simenon , last heard from in Occupied France , has to his credit the staggering total of approximately 300 novels . Most of them reflect his nonchalant ability to record in short , spare sentences the everyday life of Frenchmen of every class and type . Built up out of thousands of small incidents , Simenon 's novels never fail to show a " customary air of slow-motion absent-mindedness . " But they were written-usually on his canal boat Ostrogoth ) - at rates varying from four days to one month per novel . Says Simenon : " I get up at half-past five ; go on deck ; start typing at six , with either a bottle of brandy or white wine at my side ; and write a chapter an hour until noon , when I go on land and lie down in the grass , exhausted .
