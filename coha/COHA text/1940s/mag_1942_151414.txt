The first hardheaded , scientific program for giving U.S. workers enough vitamins appeared in a little booklet published by the National Research Council last fortnight ( The Food and Nutrition of Industrial Workers in Wartime ) . The booklet would make interesting reading for two kinds of people , neither of whom sufficiently appreciates the merits of fresh fruits , meats and vegetables : housewives who pack lunch pails and the factory managers who install cafeterias .
