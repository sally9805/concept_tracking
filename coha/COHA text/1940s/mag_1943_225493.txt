Protestant Church bodies do not make a habit of complaining to the State Department about the behavior of another Church , but last week two of them did just that . The Reformed Church in America ( 200.000 members ) , and the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.* ( 500,000 members ) were the complainers . <P> An old grievance stirred them to this unusual action . Last autumn , U.S. Roman Catholic bishops charged that Protestant missionaries in predominantly Catholic South and Central America were " a disturbing factor , " and suggested that they should stay away . Since then the U.S. Catholic press has kept the issue alive . <P> The Reformed Church 's General Synod , at Buck Hill Falls , Pa. , told the State Department that " the duty has been laid upon us by Christ to preach the Gospel to all nations . . . . To restrain all but one faith from doing what under conscience is the duty of all faiths is a violation of religious liberty . . . . " <P> The letter from the Southern Presbyterians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by this campaign , " declared the protest from the Church 's General Assembly at Montreal , N.C. , as delegates formulated plans for missionary work in Latin American lands . " If the hierarchy is right in insisting that Protestant missions should cease in Latin America because Protestants are in the minority in those countries then , on the same principle , Roman Catholic propaganda should be excluded from the United States . <P> " In the highly delicate situation that faces us in the world ... the Catholic hierarchy has indeed taken upon itself a grave responsibility in thus introducing the divisive elements of sectarianism , bigotry and religious intolerance . Lovers of democracy everywhere will be shocked at this open-handed effort to gain ecclesiastical advantage at the expense of the very principles for which free men are fighting . " <P> *Not to be confused with the much larger ( over two million members ) Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. , of which Dr. Henry Sloane Coffin is Moderator .                   @ @
