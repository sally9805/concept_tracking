The last Olympic Games ( 1936 ) were held in Berlin . This time the Germans will probably not even be allowed in the hop , skip &; jump . Last week the International Olympic Committee chose London for the next Games ( XIIth Olympiad ) . Date : 1948 . Probable grounds : the cramped Wembley Stadium , whose seating capacity ( 42,000 ) is less than half as big as the last two Olympiad scenes . Still unsettled : 1 ) what to do about Russia 's semi-pro athletes , whose victories are rewarded in cash by the Soviet Government ; 2 ) whether to invite Italy ( Germany and Japan are specifically outlawed until they can demonstrate their " good faith " ) .
