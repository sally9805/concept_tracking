George Mahon is a 30-year-old songwriter from Glasgow who can not read music . But he can hum a tune and rhyme a verse , and a month ago he hummed into a recording machine , packed the record and a verse to go with it off to a publisher . Adele England , creator of steps for the Lambeth Walk , which swept England in 1938 , heard it and devised a courtly old-world dance to match . <P> This week London debutantes were rushing off to their dancing academies to learn the new Royal Minuet , prepared as " a tribute to H.R.H. Princess Elizabeth on the occasion of her 21st birthday . " The first part ( with dance partners side by side , hands crossed in front ) was a sprightly gavotte ; after that came a quick waltz-step chorus to be danced in ballroom style . <P> Although the Keeper of the Privy Purse had pruned Mahon 's verse-a member of the Royal Family must not be named in anything that can be exploited commercially-it was still a comely tribute to Lilibet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such a dainty thing you 're bound to get . It 's created for a gracious name , A sweet princess of Royal fame. * <P> Princess Elizabeth was still in South Africa ( see PEOPLE ) and had not heard the song yet , but she is known to foot a nifty minuet . <P> * Copyright 1947 by Macmelodies Ltd. , London , for the entire world except U.S.A. and Canada .
