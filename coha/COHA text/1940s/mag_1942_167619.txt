Organized labor realizes an old ambition this week when the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations jointly take over a regular 15-minute slice of NBC 's Saturday night network time . Together they gain what neither has ever had-the opportunity to inform , and the obligation to please , a national weekly radio audience . The two organizations will alternate in producing regular weekly programs under the title Labor for Victory , Saturday nights from 10:15 to 10:30 , E.W.T. , beginning this Saturday . <P> Long bitter toward the press for-as they thought-scandalizing labor 's name , A.F. of L. 's press agent Philip Pearl and C.I.O. 's press agent Len De Caux last summer turned to the radio networks , with whom it had become a point of pride to be impartial in all debate . They started separate negotiations for radio time . By early December NBC was close to consent , but the declaration of war delayed the discussions . <P> The recent overtime pay controversy , when the A.F. of L. resorted to paid newspaper advertisements to explain its case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , NBC Commentator H. V. Kaltenborn had worked himself up to a jeremiad against the unions . The unions thereby acquired another talking point , if they wanted one , in their case for a labor interval on the radio . <P> A fortnight ago NBC granted network time to labor " as a public service . " While William Green and Philip Murray conferred with President Roosevelt one afternoon , their pressagents Pearl and De Caux agreed to alternate programs and to let a coin-toss decide who should begin the series . Green was willing , but Murray was gracious . As they left the White House . Murray said : " You can have it , Bill . " <P> Later and more formally Murray stated : " The C.I.O. will use this opportunity for . . . promoting the war effort . . . . We are most happy to cooperate with the A.F. of L. . . . " <P> Green matched him with a statement saying , " We want to tell what the workers of America are doing in the victory production program . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Both declared , in an unprecedented joint statement : " We are grateful to NBC . . . . " <P> De Caux and Pearl hope to make the Labor for Victory program popular enough for an indefinite run , using labor news , name speakers and interviews with workmen . Labor partisanship , they promise , is out .
