For three months the giant Boeing plant in Seattle , hamstrung by a manpower shortage , has failed to meet constantly rising schedules for Flying Fortresses . Up &; down the West Coast there is plenty of scary talk from other planemakers about production lags . <P> Last week all this talk caused the War Manpower Commission to do some tough , scary talking of its own . Gist of its talk : if necessary , the manpower problem may be solved by the wholesale removal of plants from the Pacific area . These were big-muscled words for often flabby WMC . And while few believed that such drastic measures would be necessary , or feasible , there was plenty of evidence that WMC is at last using its muscles to solve its No. 1 problem . <P> Chink &; Plug . Fortnight ago , WMC asked Puget Sound shipbuilders ( suspected by WMC of hoarding labor ) to lay off some 14,000 workers to give Boeing a pool from which to draw the 9,000 it estimates it needs . Speedily the shipbuilders agreed . ( WMC warned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even have some of the present ones canceled , if they did not . ) <P> But the plan seemed to have a chink as wide as a Flying Fortress . What was to prevent laid-off workers from getting jobs in other shipyards outside the Puget Sound area ( such as Henry Kaiser 's yard at Vancouver , Wash . ) ? Also , many smaller plants in the area are understaffed , pay more under the WLB freeze than Boeing . <P> Last week , WMC neatly plugged the chink . It warned that if Boeing does not get enough workers , contracts in the area will be canceled until it does . One small Seattle company , Pacific Huts , is so afraid of this very thing happening that it is taking full-page ads in Seattle newspapers urging workers to take jobs with Boeing . <P> In many another labor-parched coast area the solution calls for more than a WMC order . Within the next few months , the number of shortage areas on the West Coast is expected to jump rapidly . The total number of additional workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 250,000 early next year . To solve these problems , WMC has murmured of a National Service Act . But most planemakers dislike the idea of a labor draft . <P> Said handsome , 51-year-old Donald Douglas , president of the Douglas Aircraft Co. ( which also makes Flying Fortresses ) : " Transportation , feeding and housing are the crucial problems . If the Government breaks these bottlenecks , it wo n't need a labor draft . " But he added this warning : if the manpower problem on the West Coast is not solved , aircraft makers can not meet their huge 1944 production schedules , may even have trouble meeting them this year .
