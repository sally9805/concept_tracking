txt  | dissections and observations , but also the kind of experiments which are to be seen in sixteenth-century Padua . He declared that he both learned and taught anatomy , " not from books but from dissection " , and he combined the results of this with clinical observation and ingenious experiment . What is very remarkable in him is the comprehensive and systematic character of his investigation as a whole ? not merely in ranging over so many of the operations and so much of the topography of the blood-circuit , but also in extending the comparative method so systematically over so large a range of creatures . After we have heard so much about the mistakes that had been made through dissecting apes and other animals instead of human beings , it is curious to find Harvey making it a matter of complaint that dissection was now too often confined to the human body ? that insufficient attention was being given to the comparative method . An extraordinarily modern flavour attaches to his work as a result of the clearly mechanical nature of much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave to purely quantitative considerations ; and the final cogency that he attributed to a piece of arithmetic . It is interesting to see him talking about the heart as " a piece of machinery in which though one wheel gives motion to another , yet all the wheels seem to move simultaneously " . When he examined any anatomical feature he did not pretend immediately to deduce its function from an impression of its form and structure , but , once a hypothesis suggested itself , sought for the experiment which would mechanically confirm the idea he had conceived . Finally , though his book itself seems to lack order , it gives a clear account of the methods employed at the various points of the argument , and is remarkable as a comprehensive record of experiments made . It seems to have been the valves which set Harvey thinking , possibly the valves at the entries or outlets of the heart itself , though very soon he was concerned with those valves in the veins which his teacher Fabricius had described and which he himself appears to have regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ De motu cordis , was published in 1628 , but  | he himself wrote that " for more than nine years " he had been confirming his views " by multiple demonstrations " . He still had to fight the old heresies , and we should make a mistake if we imagined that the discoveries made by those Paduan precursors of his who have been mentioned had as yet become common property . He attacks the view that the arteries take in air , and finds it necessary to point out that Galen himself had shown them to contain nothing but blood . He notes that when they are cut or wounded they neither take in air nor expel it in the way that the windpipe does when it has been severed . He still sets out to undermine the idea that the blood crosses the septum of the heart ? that septum , he says , is " of denser and more compact structure than any part of the body itself " . If blood seeped through it , why did the septum need to have its own private supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fabric of the heart ? In any case , how could the left ventricle draw blood from the right when both contracted and dilated simultaneously e Similarly , he attacked the vexed question of the lungs ? asked why something that had all the structure of a major blood-vessel should be supposed to have the function of carrying air from the lungs to the heart , while blood , on the other hand , was alleged to strain itself so laboriously through the solid septum of the heart . He made inferences from the structure of the vessels , made experiments to test the direction of the blood in them , and ' argued from their size that they must not merely carry blood necessary for the private nourishment of the lungs , but transmit all the blood through the lungs for the purpose of refreshing it , though he was unaware of the process of oxygenation which actually takes place . In addition , he used the comparative method , showing that creatures without lungs had no right ventricle of the heart ? which confirmed his view that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was able to show that in the embryo the blood took a shorter route from the right to the left ventricle of the heart ? a route which ceased to be operative when the lungs came into action . Then he examined the fibrous structure of the heart , and showed that ?  | contrary to the hitherto accepted view ? its real activity consisted in its contraction and constriction ? that is to say , in its systole , when it pumped out blood , and not in its diastole , when it had been alleged to suck it in . His actual description of the structure and the action of the heart may be said to rank as an admirable piece of artistry . He showed that existing opinions on these subjects were neither plausible nor self-consistent ; but though he was remarkable in his use of the comparative method he was not at his most original in the experimental field , where there appear even to have been devices , already put to use , which he did not employ . The revolution that he brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the realm of mechanics , or the one that Lavoisier was to achieve in chemistry ? it was due to the power of seeing the whole subject in a new framework and re-stating the issue in a way which made the problem manageable . It was due in fact to a kind of strategic sense which enabled his mind to seize on the point of crucial significance . Harvey 's crowning argument is a simple piece of arithmetic , based on his estimate ? a rough and inaccurate estimate ? of the amount of blood which the heart sends through the body . It did not matter that his measurement was only a rough one ? he knew that his conclusion must be right , even granting the largest margin of error that anybody might impute to him . The answer was clear to any mechanically-minded person who could really bring his attention to the point ; and it rendered the rest of Harvey 's evidence and argument merely subsidiary . In regard to the capacity of the heart , he presents us with a sentence that can be left to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quantity and source of the blood which thus passes is of a character so novel and unheard of that I not only fear injury to myself from the envy of a few but I tremble lest I have mankind at large for my enemies , so much doth wont and custom become a second nature .  | He found that in the space of an hour the heart would throw out more blood than the weight of a man , far more blood than could be created in that time out of any nourishment received . It was impossible to say where all that blood came from and where it could possibly go , unless one adopted the hypothesis that it went streaming through the whole body time after time in a continual circulation . Harvey followed that circuladon from the left ventricle of the heart and around the body , showing how it explained the position of the valves of the heart , and accounted for the harder structure of the arteries , especially near the heart , where they had to bear the shock of each propulsion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies the blood had drained away from the arteries but not the veins , and he could give a more satisfactory reason for those valves in the veins which left the way to the heart open but prevented the return of the blood to the outer branches of the veins . The one link in the chain , the one part of the circulation , which he failed to trace was the passage of the blood from the outermost ramifications of the arteries to the outlying branches of the veins . The connection here could only be discovered with a microscope , and was made good in 1661 when Malpighi announced his identification of what are called the capillaries in the almost transparent lungs of a frog . It seems to have taken between thirty and fifty years for Harvey 's work to secure acceptance , though his arguments would perhaps seem more cogent to us today than . those of any other treatise that had been written up to this period ; since , though he held some of the unsatisfactory speculative views which were current at that time ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never depended on these , and his thesis was so mechanically satisfying in itself that it helped to render them meaningless and unnecessary in future . Descartes welcomed the idea of the circulation of the blood , but it appears that his acceptance of it was based on a partial misunderstanding , and he differed from Harvey on the question of the action or function of the heart itself . Most important of all , however , is the fact that the establishment of the circulation of the blood  | released physiology for a new start in the study of living creatures . Only now could one begin to understand respiration itself properly , or even the digestive and other functions . Given the circulation of the blood running through the arteries and then back by the veins , one could begin to ask " what it carries , and why , how and where it takes up its loads , and how , where and why it parts with them " . Both in regard to methods and results , therefore , we seem to have touched something like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ARISTOTLE AND PTOLEMY As the crucial stage in the grand controversy concerning the Ptolemaic system does not seem to have been treated organically , and is seldom or never envisaged in its entirety , it is necessary that we should put together a fairly continuous account of it , so that we may survey the transition as a whole . A bird's-eye view of the field should be of some significance for the student of the scientific revolution in general , especially as the battles come in crescendo and rise to their greatest intensity in this part of the campaign . It would be wrong to imagine that the publication of Copernicus 's great work in 1543 either shook the foundations of European thought straight away or sufficed to accomplish anything like a scientific revolution . Almost a hundred and fifty years were needed before there was achieved a satisfactory combination of ideas ? a satisfactory system of the universe ? which permitted an explanation of the movement of the earth and the other planets , and provided a framework for further scientific development . Short of this , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the close of the sixteenth century ? that the period of crucial transition really opened and the conflict even became intense . And when the great perturbations occurred they were the result of very different considerations=-the result of events which would have shaken the older cosmos almost as much if Copernicus had never even written his revolutionary work . Indeed , though the influence of Copernicus was as important as people generally imagine it to have been , this influence resulted not so much from the success of his actual system of the skies , but rather from the stimulus which he gave to men who in reality were producing something very different . When Copernicus 's work first appeared it provoked reli-  | gious objections , especially on Biblical grounds , and since the Protestants were the party particularly inclined to what was called Bibliolatry , some scathing condemnations very soon appeared from their side ? for example , from Luther and Melanchthon personally . One may suspect that unconscious prejudice had some part in this , and that the Aristotelian view of the universe had become entangled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Testament talked of God establishing the earth fast , the words were capable of elastic interpretation , and Biblical exegesis in previous centuries had managed to get round worse corners than this . In any case , if the Old Testament was not Copernican , it was very far from being Ptolemaic either . And it gives something of a blow to Aristotle and his immaculate fifth essence , surely , when it says that the heavens shall grow old as a garment , and , talking of God , tells us that the stars and the very heavens themselves are not pure in His sight . The prejudice long remained with the Protestants , and when a few years ago the Cambridge History of Science Committee celebrated in the Senate House the tercentenary of the visit to England of the great Czech educator Comenius or Komensky , the numerous orations overlooked the fact that he was anti-Copernican and that his text-books , reprinted in successive editions throughout the seventeenth century , were a powerful influence in the Protestant world on the wrong side of the question . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic Church and high dignitaries of that Church were associated with the publication of his book . The comparatively mild reception which the new view received on this side led only recently to the enunciation of the view that the Roman Catholics , being slow in the uptake , took nearly fifty years to see that Copernicus was bound to lead to Voltaire . The truth was , however , that the question of the movement of the earth reached the stage of genuine conflict only towards the end of the sixteenth century , as I have said . By that time ? and for different reasons altogether ? the religious difficulties themselves were beginning to appear more serious than before .  | Although Copernicus had not stated that the universe was infinite ? and had declared this issue to belong rather to the province of the philosopher ? he had been compelled , for a reason which we shall have to consider later , to place the fixed stars at what he called an immeasurable distance away . He was quickly interpreted ? particularly by some English followers ? as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and unless they had some non-religious objections Christians could hardly complain of this , or declare it to be impossible , without detracting from the power and glory of God . Unfortunately , however , that enfant terrible amongst sixteenth-century Italian speculators , Giordano Bruno , went further and talked of the actual existence of a plurality of worlds . There arose more seriously than ever before the question : Did the human beings in other worlds need redemption ? Were there to be so many appearances of Christ , so many incarnations and so many atonements throughout the length and breadth of this infinite universe ? That question was much more embarrassing than the purely Biblical issue which was mentioned earlier ; and the unbridled speculations of Bruno , who was burned by the Inquisition for a number of heresies in Moo , were a further factor in the intensification of religious fear on the subject of the Copernican system . Apart from all this , it is remarkable from how many sides and in how many forms one meets the thesis that is familiar also in the writings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is absurd to suppose that the whole of this new colossal universe was created by God purely for the sake of men , purely to serve the purposes of the earth . The whole outlay seemed to be too extravagant now that things were seen in their true proportions and the object had come to appear so insignificant . At this later stage the resistance to the Copernican hypothesis was common to both Roman Catholics and Protestants , though in England itself it appears to have been less strong than in most other places . The Protestant astronomer , Kepler , persecuted by the Protestant Faculty at Tubingen , actually took refuge with the Jesuits in 1596 . Both the Protes-  | tant , Kepler , and the Roman Catholic , Galileo , ventured into the realms of theology by addressing their co-religionists and attempting to show them that the Copernican system was consistent with a fair interpretation of the words of Scripture . Galileo made excellent use of St. Augustine , and for a time he received more encouragement in the higher ecclesiastical circles in Rome than from his Aristotelian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run it was Protestantism which for semi-technical reasons had an elasticity that enabled it to make alliance with the scientific and the rationalist movements , however . That process in its turn greatly altered the character of Protestantism from the closing years of the seventeenth century , and changed it into the more liberalising movement of modern times . The religious obstruction could hardly have mattered , however , if it had not been supported partly by scientific reasons and partly by the conservatism of the scientists themselves . It has been pointed out by one student that to a certain degree it was the astrologers who were the more ready to be openminded on this subject in the sixteenth century . Apart from the difficulties that might be involved in the whole new synthesis which Copernicus had provided ( and which , as we have seen , included a quasi-superstitious reliance upon the virtues of circles and the behaviour of spheres as such ) , there were particular physical objections to the attribution of movement to the earth , whether on the plan put forward by Copernicus or in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had tried to meet the particular objections in detail , but it will easily be understood that his answers , which we have already noted , were not likely to put the matter beyond controversy . Copernicus himself had been aware that his hypothesis was open to objection in a way that has not hitherto been mentioned . If the earth moved in a colossal orbit around the sun , then the fixed stars ought to show a slight change of position when observed from opposite sides of the orbit . In fact , there is a change but it is so slight that for three centuries after  | Copernicus it was not detected , and Copernicus had to explain what then appeared to be a discrepancy by placing the fixed stars so far away that the width of the earth 's orbit was only a point in comparison with this distance . If the Ptolemaic theory strained credulity somewhat by making the fixed stars move at so great a pace in their diurnal rotation , Copernicus strained credulity in those days by what seemed a corresponding extravagance ? he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fabulous distance away . He even robbed his system of some of its economy and its symmetry ; for after all the beautiful spacing between the sun and the successive planets he found himself obliged to put a prodigal wilderness of empty space between the outermost planet , Saturn , and the fixed stars . The situation was even more paradoxical than this . When Galileo first used a telescope , one of his initial surprises was to learn that the fixed stars now appeared to be smaller than they had seemed to the naked eye ; they showed themselves , he said , as mere pin-points of light . Owing to a kind of blur the fixed stars appear to be bigger than they really ought to appear to the naked eye , and Copernicus , living before that optical illusion had been clarified , was bound to be under certain misapprehensions on this subject . Even before his time some of the fixed stars had seemed unbelievably large when the attempt had been made to calculate their size on the basis of their apparent magnitude . His removal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while their apparent magnitude remained the same , of course , to the terrestrial observer ) made it necessary to regard them as immensely bigger still , and strained a credulity which had been stretched over-far already . Beyond this there was the famous objection that if the world were rushing from west to east a stone dropped from the top of a tower ought to be left behind , falling therefore well to the west of the tower . The famous Danish astronomer , Tycho Brahe , took this argument seriously , however absurd it might appear to us , and he introduced the new argument that a cannon-ball ought to carry much farther one way than the  | other , supposing the earth to be in motion . This argument had a novel flavour that made it particularly fashionable in the succeeding period . In the meantime , however , certain other important things had been happening , and as a result of these it gradually became clear that great changes would have to take place in astronomy ? that , indeed , the older theories were unworkable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . One of these occurrences was the appearance of a new star in 1572 ? an event which one historian of science appears to me to be correct in describing as a greater shock to European thought than the publication of the Copernican hypothesis itself . This star is said to have been brighter in the sky than anything except the sun , the moon and Venus ? visible even in daylight sometimes ? and it shone throughout the whole of the year 1573 , only disappearing early in 1574 . If it was a new star it contradicted the old view that the sublime heavens knew neither change nor generation nor corruption , and people even reminded themselves that God had ceased the work of creation on the seventh day . Attempts were made to show that the star existed only in the sublunary region , and even Galileo later thought it necessary to expose the inaccurate observations which were selected from the mass of available data to support this view . After all , Copernicus had only put forward an alternative theory of the skies which he claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , men were meeting inconvenient facts which sooner or later they would have to stop denying . In 1577 a new comet appeared , and even some people who disbelieved the Copernican theory had to admit that it belonged to the upper skies , not to the sublunary regions ? the more accurate observations which were now being made had altered the situation in regard to the observation of the whereabouts of comets . As this one cut a path straight through what were supposed to be the impenetrable crystal spheres that formed the skies , it encouraged the view that the spheres did not actually exist as part ofthe machinery ofthe heavens ; Tycho Brahe , conservative though he was in other respects , hence-  | forward declared his disbelief in the reality of these orbs . In the last quarter of the sixteenth century Giordano Bruno , whom I have already mentioned , pictured the planets and stars floating in empty space , though it now became more difficult than ever to say why they moved and how they were kept in their regular paths . Also the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the earth , which ignited in the sphere of fire ? all within the sublunary realm ? was no longer tenable . And those who did not wish to fly in the face of actual evidence began to modify the Aristotelian theory in detail ? one man would say that the upper heavens were not unchangeable and uncorruptible ; another would say that the very atmosphere extended throughout the upper skies , enabling the exhalations from the earth to rise and ignite even in the regions far above the moon . Quite apart from any attack which Copernicus had made upon the system , the foundations of the Ptolemaic universe were beginning to shake . It is particularly towards the end of the sixteenth century that we can recognise the extraordinary intermediate situation which existed ? we can see the people themselves already becoming conscious of the transitional stage which astronomical science had reached . In 1589 one writer , Magini , said that there was a great demand for a new hypothesis which would supersede the Ptolemaic one and yet not be so absurd as the Copernican . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than either those of Ptolemy or those of Copernicus , and that the time had come for " the radical renovation of astronomy " . People even put forward the view that one should drop all hypotheses and set out simply to assemble a collection of more accurate observations . Tycho Brahe replied to this that it was impossible to sit down just to observe without the guidance of any hypothesis at all . Yet that radical renovation of astronomy which Maestlin required was being carried out precisely in the closing years of the sixteenth century ; and Tycho Brahe was its first leader , becoming important not for his hypotheses but precisely because of what has been called the " chaos " of observations  | that he left behind for his successors . We have seen that in the last quarter of the sixteenth century he achieved practically all that in fact was achieved , if not all that was possible , in the way of pre-telescopic observation . He greatly improved the instruments and the accuracy of observation . He followed the planets throughout the whole of their courses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special points in their orbits . We have noticed also his anti-Copernican fervour , and in one respect his actual systematising was important , though his theories were not justified by events ; and when he had made his observations he did not follow them up with any development of them since he was not a remarkable mathematician . He attempted , however , to establish a compromise between the Ptolemaic and the Copernican systems ? some of the planets moving around the sun , but then the sun and its planetary system moving in a great sweep around the motionless earth . This is a further illustration of the intermediate and transitional character of this period , for his compromise gained a certain following ; he complained later that other men pretended to be the inventors of it ; and after a certain period in the seventeenth century this system secured the adhesion of those who still refused to believe in the actual movement of the earth . He was not quite so original as he imagined , and his compromise system has a history which goes back to much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chaos of data collected and recorded by Tycho Brahe came into the hands of a man who had been his assistant for a time , Johann Kepler , the pupil of the very person , Maestlin , who had demanded a renovation of astronomy . Kepler , therefore , emerges not merely as an isolated genius , but as a product of that whole movement of renovation which was taking place at the end of the sixteenth century . He had the advantage over Tycho Brahe in that he was a great mathematician , and he could profit from considerable advances that had taken place in mathematics during the sixteenth century . There was one further factor which curiously assisted that renovation of astronomy which  | we are examining at the moment , and it was a factor of special importance if the world was to get rid of the crystal spheres and see the planets merely floating in empty space . An Englishman , William Gilbert , published a famous book on the magnet in i600 and laid himself open to the gibes of Sir Francis Bacon for being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject of research that they could only see the whole universe transposed into the terms of it . Having made a spherical magnet called a terrella , and having found that it revolved when placed in a magnetic field , he decided that the whole earth was a magnet , that gravity was a form of magnetic attraction , and that the principles of the magnet accounted for the workings of the Copernican system as a whole . Kepler and Galileo were both influenced by this view , and with Kepler it became an integral part of his system , a basis for a doctrine of almost universal gravitation . William Gilbert provided intermediate assistance therefore ? brought a gleam of light ? when the Aristotelian cosmos was breaking down and the heavenly bodies would otherwise have been left drifting blindly in empty space . With all these developments behind him , therefore , the famous Kepler in the first thirty years of the seventeenth century " reduced to order the chaos of data " left by Tycho Brahe , and added to them just the thing that was needed ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since it did not ultimately prevail , merely remains as a strange monument of colossal intellectual power working on insufficient materials ; and even more than Copernicus he was driven by a mystical semi-religious fervour ? a passion to uncover the magic of mere numbers and to demonstrate the music of the spheres . In his attempt to disclose mathematical sympathies in the machinery of the skies he tried at one moment to relate the planetary orbits to geometrical figures , and at another moment to make them correspond to musical notes . He was like the child who having picked a mass of wild flowers tries to arrange them into a posy this way , and then tries another way , exploring the possible combinations  | and harmonies . He has to his credit a collection of discoveries and conclusions ? some of them more ingenious than useful  - -  from which we today can pick out three that have a permanent importance in the history of astronomy . Having discovered in the first place that the planets did not move at a uniform speed , he set out to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a line were drawn from a given planet to the sun that line would describe equal areas in equal times . At two different points in his calculations it would appear that he made mistakes , but the conclusion was happy , for the two errors had the effect of cancelling one another out . Kepler realised that the pace of the planet was affected by its nearness to the sun ? a point which encouraged him in his view that the planets were moved by a power actually emitted by the sun . His achievements would have been impossible without that tremendous improvement in observation which had taken place since the time of Copernicus . He left behind him great masses of papers which help the historian of science to realise better than in the case of his predecessors his actual manner of work and the stages by which he made his discoveries . It was when working on the data left by Tycho Brahe on the subject of the movements of Mars that he found himself faced with the problem of accounting for the extraordinary anomalies in the apparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditure of energy he tried one hypothesis after another , and threw them away , until he reached a point where he had a vague knowledge of the shape required , decided that for purposes of calculation an ellipse might give him at any rate approximate results , and then found that an ellipse was right ? a conclusion which he assumed then to be true also for the other planets . Some people have said that Kepler emancipated the world from the myth of circular motion , but this is hardly true , for from the time of the ancient Ptolemy men had realised that the planets themselves did not move in regular circles . Copernicus had been aware that certain combinations of circular motion would provide an elliptical course , and even after  | Kepler we find people accounting for the new elliptical path of the planets by reference to a mixture of circular movements . The obsession on the subject of circular motion was disappearing at this time , however , for other reasons , and chiefly because the existence of the hard crystal spheres was ceasing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various inner wheels of the vast celestial machine , that had enjoyed the happiness of circular motion , while the planet , recording the resultant effect of various compound movements , had been realised all the time to be pursuing a more irregular course . It was the circular motion of the spheres themselves that symbolised the perfection of the skies , while the planet was like the rear lamp of a bicycle ? it might be the only thing that could actually be seen from the earth , and it dodged about in an irregular manner ; but just as we know that it is really the man on the bicycle who matters , though we see nothing save the red light , so the celestial orbs had formed the essential machinery of the skies , though only the planet that rode on their shoulder was actually visible . Once the crystal spheres were eliminated , the circular motion ceased to be the thing that really mattered ? henceforward it was the actual path of the planet itself that fixed one 's attention . It was as though the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the rear lamp , the red light , was discovered to be sailing on its own account in empty space . The world might be rid of the myth of circular motion , but it was faced with more difficult problems than ever with these lamps let loose and no bicycle to attach them to . If the skies were like this , men had to discover why they remained in any order at all ? why the universe was not shattered by the senseless onrush and the uncontrollable collidings of countless billiard-balls . Kepler believed in order and in the harmony of numbers , and it was in his attempt to fasten upon the music of the spheres that he discovered , amongst many other things , that third of his series of planetary laws which was to prove both useful and permanent ? namely , the law that the squares of the period of the orbit were proportional to the cubes of their  | mean distances from the sun . By this time Kepler was mystical in a sense somewhat different from before ? he was no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be heard by God or man , or which should be loaded with mystical content . The music of the spheres was now nothing more or less to him than mathematics as such ? the purely mathematical sympathies that the universe exhibited ? so that what concerned him was merely to drive ahead , for ever eliciting mathematical proportions in the heavens . In fact , we may say that this worship of numerical patterns , of mathematical relations as such , took the place of the older attempt , that was still visible in Galileo , to transpose the skies into terms of circles and spheres , and became the foundation of a new kind of astronomy . It is in this particular sense that Kepler can most properly be described as having provided an improvement upon the old superstition which had hankered only after circular motion . Furthermore , by the same route , Kepler became the apostle of a mechanistic system ? the first one of the seventeenth-century kind ? realising that he was aspiring to turn the universe into pure clockwork , and believing that this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will be necessary to glance at the Keplerian system as a whole when we come to the problem of gravitation at a later stage of the story . We must note that , of course , Kepler believed in the motion of the earth , and showed that if this supposition were accepted the movement conformed to the laws which he had discovered for the planets in general . Besides Kepler 's three planetary laws , one final addition was being made in this period to the collection of material that spelt the doom of Ptolemy and Piristotle . In 1609 Galileo , having heard of the discovery of the telescope in Holland , created a telescope for himself , though not before an actual sample of the Dutch instrument had appeared in Venice . Instantly the sky was filled with new things and the conservative view of the heavenly bodies became more completely untenable than ever . Two items were of particular importance . First , the discovery of the satellites of Jupiter provided a picture  | of what might be described as a sort of miniature solar system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously goes round the earth , ergo in a regular heaven the celestial bodies must move about the same centre , were now confronted with the fact that Jupiter had its own moons , which revolved around it , while both Jupiter and its attendants certainly moved together either around the sun as the Copernicans said , or around the earth according to the system of Ptolemy . Something besides the earth could be shown to operate therefore as the centre of motions taking place in the sky . Secondly , the sunspots now became visible and if Galileo 's observations of them were correct they destroyed the basis for the view that the heavens were immaculate and unchanging . Galileo set out to demonstrate that the spots were , so to speak , part of the sun , actually revolving with it , though the Aristotelians tried to argue that they were an intervening cloud , and that some of Galileo 's discoveries were really the result of flaws in the lenses of his telescope . Galileo was seriously provoked by these taunts and at this point of the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unprecedented degree of intensity , not only because the situation was ripe for it , but because Galileo , goaded to scorn by university colleagues and monks , turned his attention from questions of mechanics to the larger problem of the Aristotelian issue in general . He ranged over the whole field of that controversy , bringing to it an amazing polemical imagination , which goaded the enemy in turn . His intervention was particularly important because the point had been reached at which there was bound to be a complete impasse unless the new astronomy could be married somehow to the new science of dynamics . The Aristotelian cosmos might be jeopardised , and indeed was doomed to destruction . by the recent astronomical disclosures ; yet these facts did not in the least help the enquirers over the original hurdle ? did not show them how to square the movement of the earth itself with the principles of Aristotelian mechanics or how to account for the motions in the sky . Copernicus had taken one course in treating the earth as virtually a celestial  | body in the Aristotelian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operated in the higher reaches of the skies . Galileo complemented this by taking now the opposite course ? rather treating the heavenly bodies as terrestrial ones , regarding the planets as subject to the very laws which applied to balls sliding down inclined planes . There was something in all this which tended to the reduction of the whole universe to uniform physical laws , and it is clear that the world was coming to be more ready to admit such a view . After his construction of a telescope in 1609 and the disturbing phenomena which it quickly revealed in the skies , Galileo 's relations with the Peripatetics ? the worshippers of Aristotle ? at the university of Padua became intensely bitter . Though for a time he met with support and encouragement in high places and even in Rome itself , the intensified controversy led to the condemnation of the Copernican hypothesis by the Congregation of the Index in 1616 . This did not prevent Galileo from producing in the years 1625-29 the series of Dialogues on The Two Principal World-Systems which he designed to stand as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemnation . This book traversed the whole range of anti-Aristotelian argument , not merely in the realm of astronomy , but in the field of mechanics , as though seeking to codify the entire case against the adherents of the ancient system . It stands as a testimony to the fact that it was vain to attack the Aristotelian teaching merely at a single point ? vain to attempt in one corner of the field to reinterpret motion by the theory of impetus as the Parisian scholastics had done ? which was only like filling the gap in one jigsaw puzzle with a piece out of a different jigsaw puzzle altogether . What was needed was a large-scale change of design ? the substitution of one highly dovetailed system for another ? and in a sense it appeared to be the case that the whole Aristotelian synthesis had to be overturned at once . And that is why Galileo is so important ; for , at the strategic moment , he took the lead in a policy of simultaneous attack on the whole front . The work in question was written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the realm of learning ? wider than that university world which Galileo had set out to attack . Its argument was conducted much more in the language of ordinary conversation , much more in terms of general discourse , than the present-day reader would expect ? the Dialogues themselves are remarkable for their literary skill and polemical scorn . Galileo paid little attention to Kepler 's astronomical discoveries ? remaining more Copernican in his general views , more content to discuss purely circular motion in the skies , than the modern reader would expect to be the case . He has been regarded as unfair because he talked only of two principal world-systems , those of Ptolemy and Copernicus , leaving the new systems of Tycho Brahe and Johann Kepler entirely out of account . In his mechanics he was a little less original than most people imagine , since , apart from the older teachers of the impetus-theory , he had had more immediate precursors , who had begun to develop the more modern views concerning the flight of projectiles , the law of inertia and the behaviour of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that clouds and air and everything on the earth ? including falling bodies ? naturally moved round with the rotating earth , as part of the same mechanical system , and in their relations with one another were unaffected by the movement , so that like the objects in the cabin of a moving ship , they might appear motionless to anybody moving with them . His system of mechanics did not quite come out clear and clean , did not even quite explicitly reach the modern law of inertia , since here again he had not quite disentangled himself from obsessions concerning circular motion . It was chiefly in his mechanics , however , that Galileo made his contributions to the solution of the problem of the skies ; and here he came so near to the mark that his successors had only to continue their work on the same lines ? future students were able to read back into his writings views which in fact were only put forward later . Galileo 's kind of mechanics had a strategic place in the story , for they had to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order was established . And the  | new dynamics themselves could not be developed merely out of a study of terrestrial motion . Galileo is important because he began to develop them with reference to the behaviour of the heavenly bodies too . At the end of everything Galileo failed to clinch his argument ? he did not exactly prove the rotation of the earth ? and in the resulting situation a reader could either adopt his whole way of looking at things or could reject it in toto ? it was a question of taking over that whole realm of thought into which he had transposed the question . It was true that the genuinely scientific mind could hardly resist the case as a whole , or refuse to enter into the new way of envisaging the matter ; but when Galileo 's mouthpiece was charged in the Dialogues with having failed to prove his case ? having done nothing more than explain away the ideas that made the movement of the earth seem impossible ? he seemed prepared to admit that he had not demonstrated the actual movement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his secret weapon ? he declared that he had an argument which would really clinch the matter . We know that Galileo attached a crucial importance to this argument , which appears in the fourth book , and , in fact , he thought of taking the title of the whole work from this particular part of it . His argument was that the tides demonstrated the movement of the earth . He made a long examination of them and said that they were caused , so to speak , by the shaking of the vessel which contained them . This seemed to contradict his former argument that everything on the earth moved with the earth , and was as unaffected by the movement as the candle in the cabin of a moving ship . It was the combination of motions , however ? the daily rotation together with the annual movement , and the accompanying strains and changes of pace ? which produced the jerks , he said , and therefore set the tides in motion . Nothing can better show the transitional stage of the question even now than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the earth was a great mistake and did nothing to bring the solution of the question nearer .  | Aristotelian physics were clearly breaking down , and the Ptolemaic system was split from top to bottom . But not till the time of Newton did the satisfactory alternative system appear ; and though the more modern of the scientists tended to believe in the movement of the earth from this time , the general tendency from about 163o seems to have been to adopt the compromise system of Tycho Brahe . In 1672 a writer could say that the student of the heavens had four different world-systems from which to choose , and there were men who even talked of seven . Even at this later date an enquirer could still come forward ? as Galileo had done ? and claim that at last he had discovered the capital argument . The long existence of this dubious , intermediate situation brings the importance of Sir Isaac Newton into still stronger relief . We can better understand also , if we can not condone , the treatment which Galileo had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dialogues on The Two Principal World-Systems he had certainly displayed in more ways than one . Although Galileo 's most famous writings appeared in the 163o 's they were the fruits of work which had been done at an earlier date . The second quarter of the seventeenth century represents really a new generation ? that of the disciples of Galileo , and particularly of those who followed him in his capacity as the founder of modern mechanics . In the 163o 's and 164o 's his arguments are carried to a further stage , and the essential theme of the story assembles itself around a group of interrelated workers whose centre seems to be Paris , though there are connections also with Holland and Italy . The group in question includes Isaac Beeckman ( 1588-1637 ) in Holland , a man who stimulated others to take an interest in important problems and initiated a number of ideas . Next to him comes Marin Mersenne ( 1588-1648 ) , not himself a great discoverer , but a central depot of information and a general channel of ' communication ? a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against another , and incited his colleagues to controversy . Next again in point of age comes  | Pierre Gassendi ( 1592-1655 ) , a philosopher and writer of scientific biographies , who possessed an encyclopaedic knowledge of the sciences of the time . And after him comes Rene Descartes ( 1596-1650 ) , though in many respects he stands out as a lonely worker , mathematician , physicist and philosopher all in one . Gilles de Roberval ( 1602-75 ) comes next , and he is an original figure , essentially a mathematician ; while Galileo 's pupil , Evangelista Torricelli ( 1608-47 ) , also comes into the picture on occasion . Even the famous Pascal , and also Christian Huygens , were brought into contact with the circle as young men in the latter part of the period , and helped to form the bridge to a later generation , their fathers having been connected with the group . The Englishman , Thomas Hobbes , first began to develop his views on the physical universe after he had made contact with Mersenne and his friends . These are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though they are disciples of Galileo in the field of mechanics they are at first inclined to adopt a cautious attitude in respect of his cosmology . Some of them feel that Galileo has not established the case for Copernicus , though they may like the Copernican system because it is more economical and more aesthetic than the ancient one . What they have chiefly taken over is Galileo 's way of mathematising a problem , and what affects them most of all perhaps is the establishment of the modern principle of inertia ? the thesis that things will continue their movement in a straight line until something actually intervenes to check or to alter their motion . This principle is important because it provides the starting-point for a new science of dynamics . Work was continued on the problem of falling bodies and on questions of hydrostatics ; and the atmosphere itself was now being examined on mechanical principles . Round about 163o , in various regions independently , work was conducted on the assumption that the air has weight ; the problem of the possible existence of a vacuum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry us from Galileo to Torricelli 's famous experiment ? to the barometer and the  | air-pump . The old way of explaining things through the assumed existence of secret sympathies in various forms of matter , or through nature 's " abhorrence " of a vacuum , was derided ? only mechanical explanations would serve . The magnet was still a serious problem , because it seemed to confirm the idea ofsympathetic attraction ; but there was now a tendency to believe that it would some day be explicable on mechanical principles . One was now less inclined to believe in the ability of the magnet to recognise an adulterous woman or to bring about peace between man and wife . The war on Aristotle still continued ; and this meant also war against medieval scholasticism and against the modem conservative followers of Aristotle , the Peripatetics , who retained their place in the universities even after this period was over . But the warfare was equally against the so-called naturalism of the Renaissance ? the belief in pan-psychism and animism , which gave everything a soul and saw miracles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of religion itself that Renaissance naturalism was attacked , and the Christians helped the cause of modem rationalism by their jealous determination to sweep out of the world all miracles and magic except their own . Some of this new generation of scientists argued that Christian miracles themselves could not be vindicated unless it could be assumed that the normal workings of the universe were regular and subject to law . In the circle around Mersenne in the 163o 's the idea of a complete mechanistic interpretation of the universe came out into the open , and its chief exponents were the most religious men in the group that we are discussing . They were anxious to prove the /// adequacy and the perfection of Creation ? anxious to vindicate God 's rationality . The advent of the printed book on the one hand , and of the woodcut and the engraving on the other , had greatly transformed the problem of scientific communication from the time of the Renaissance , though even in the sixteenth century it is surprising to see how local the effect of original work might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spondence between scientific workers became significant ? particularly perhaps that between the astronomers , who found it valuable to compare the observations that were made in one place and another . From the time of Galileo the development of modern science appears much more as a general movement ; it is much less capable of reconstruction as a case of isolated endeavour . The experimental method became quite the fashion amongst groups of people both inside the universities and outside them ; and men who had previously cultivated antiquity or collected coins began to regard it as a mark of culture to patronise science and experiments too , and to collect rare plants or curiosities in nature . Amongst the clergy and the university teachers , the doctors and the gentry , there would emerge enthusiastic amateurs , some of them attracted by the love of marvels , by mechanical tricks and toys , or by the fantastic side of nature . Indeed , a good number of the famous names of the seventeenth century would seem to have belonged to this class . To a certain degree the scientist made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other purposes in that period ; and the antecedents of the scientific societies are the literary clubs of the sixteenth century and the groups of people who assembled to discuss philosophy at the time of the Renaissance . It was customary for people to meet in informal societies and read news-letters which had been written from correspondents abroad ? letters which would describe not only political events but recent publications and movements of ideas . Scientific works and even experiments would come to be included in the readings and discussions . In some cases , those who were interested in science would feel that the news was too political , and would try to make the proceedings more scientific or would be inclined to break away and form a purely scientific circle of their own . One group at the house of the French historian De Thou had been composed of scholars , men of letters and members of the professions , and later , for a number of decades , it sat under the brothers Dupuy , serving as a bureau for the exchange of foreign news and being at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not always move on the same course , however , and we fmd members of the scientific movement ? Mersenne and Gassendi , for example ? amongst those who attended its gatherings . Henry Oldenburg , later Secretary of the Royal Society , went to the meetings in 1659-6o . Between 1633 and 1642 weekly conferences were held at the house of Theophraste Renaudot in Paris , and here a weekly pamphlet was published . They were called Conferences de Bureau d'Adresse , and the discussions dealt with concepts such as those of First Matter and Cause , subjects like air , water , atoms , dew and fire , mythical creatures like the unicorn and the phoenix , but also novels , dancing , the education of women and the status of trade . These conferences had an influence in England in the late 164o 's . More serious groups or societies or academies existed amongst actual scientific workers from the very beginning of the seventeenth century , however ; and here the priority seems to belong to a circle in Rome called the Accademie dei Lincei , which ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they were broken up because they were suspected of poisonings and incantations . They met at the house of their patron , a Duke , but hoped to establish their own museum , library , laboratory , botanical garden and printing office , as well as to organise subordinate branches in various parts of the world . From 1609 their written proceedings form the earliest recorded publication of a scientific society . Galileo himself was an active member , and he made a microscope for the society , which published one or two of his important works . Similar historical significance attaches to the conferences founded by Mersenne in 1635 and kept up by him until his death in 1648 , conferences which brought together with more or less regularity the mathematicians and physicists , Gassendi , Desargues , Roberval , Descartes , the elder and the younger Pascal , and many others . Mersenne , we are told , is responsible more than any other ' single person for the establishment of the intellectual centre of Europe in Paris during the middle  | third of the seventeenth century . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one scientist to another , submitted the suggestions of one worker to the criticism of a rival , established relations abroad and created the most important system of scientific communication then in existence . Much of the essential history of science in the seventeenth century has to be worked out from the massive correspondence of men like Mersenne . In the more definitely scientific gatherings the work of individual scientists would be checked , their experiments would be repeated and subjected to criticism , and their conclusions would become the subject of debate .  | THE EXPERIMENTAL METHOD IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY IT is not always realised to what a degree the sciences in the middle ages were a matter for what we today would describe as literary transmission , and came into European history as a heritage from ancient Greece and imperial Rome . Nobody can examine the actual state of scientific knowledge in , say , the tenth century A.D. without realising what had been lost both in scholarship and in technique ? indeed , in civilisation as a whole ? since the days of ancient Athens and ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flourished . Nobody who has any picture of Europe as it emerged from the dark ages , or any impression of our Anglo-Saxon forefathers one or two centuries before the Norman Conquest , will imagine that the world was then in a condition to discover by its own enquiries and experiments the scientific knowledge which Athens and Alexandria had attained at a time when their civilisation was at its peak . Actual contact with the science of the ancient world had to be re-established by the unearthing of texts and manuscripts , or by the acquisition of translations and commentaries from peoples like the Arabs or the subjects of the Byzantine Empire , who already possessed , or had never lost , the contact . That process of recovery reached its climax and came to full consciousness in the period of what we call the Renaissance . It would have taken many hundreds of years more if the middle ages had had , so to speak , to find the same things out for themselves ? to re-create so much of the development of science by independent enquiry and unaided research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the history of medieval thought rests on a framework of dates which are really dates in the literary transmission of ancient science and scholarship . Historians find it of primary importance to dis-  | cover at what date such and such a work of Aristotle was resuscitated in western Europe ; or when this or that scientific treatise became available through an Arabian translation , and ? better still ? when western Europe was able to acquire the authentic text in the original Greek . The process was not stopped by any reluctance on the part of Catholic Europe to learn from the infidel Arabians or the Byzantine schismatics or even the pagan Greeks . Nor is it known that there was any opportunity which the middle ages missed ? any great store of science that they turned their backs upon because it was tainted with paganism or infidelity . Because the intelligentsia in the middle ages was a clerical one and the intellectual leadership was religious in character , such natural science as existed was the more likely to keep the subordinate place it had always had in a larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could hardly be said to have existed then , in any significant sense of the term . Because the purely literary transmission was so important , that thing which we call science , and which might rather be called natural philosophy , was first and foremost a series of ancient texts upon which one commentary after another would be compiled , often by people writing , so to speak , at a desk . If even at the Renaissance philology was considered the queen of the sciences , this was because the man who was master of the classical languages did in fact hold the key position . We can still read the letters of humanists who cursed their fate because they had to ruin their style by translating works of physics from the Greek . So in the middle ages men found themselves endowed with an explanation of the physical universe and the workings of nature which had fallen upon them out of the blue , and which they had taken over full-grown and ready-made . And they were infinitely more the slaves of that intellectual system than if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own original researches and their own wrestlings with truth . There even seems to have been a perceptible hurdle here and there where there was a gap in the transmission ? where patches of ancient scholarship had still remained undiscovered.  | We have already noticed , for example , certain tendencies in fourteenth-century Paris which are considered to have been nipped in the bud because of a deficiency in mathematics  --  a deficiency somewhat rectified by a further recovery of ancient texts in the period of the Renaissance . Under such conditions the chief openings for independent thought ? the chief controversies in the sixteenth century even ? occurred at those places where the ancient writers were found to have differed from one another . And though in the later middle ages there were men who were doing experiments and pushing back the frontiers of thought , they were , for the most part , like the theorists of the impetus , only playing on the margin of that Aristotelian system which in the year 1500 must have appeared at least as valid to ' a rational thinker as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were men in the later middle ages who were carefully observing nature , and improving greatly in the accuracy of their observations , these tended to compile encyclopaedias of purely descriptive matter . When there was anything that needed to be explained these men would not elicit their theories from the observations themselves ? they would still draw on that whole system of explanation which had been provided for them by the ancient philosophy . Sir Francis Bacon , early in the seventeenth century , complained of this divorce between observation and explanation , and it was part of his purpose to show how the latter ought to arise out of the former . So far as one can see , the mathematics of ancient Alexandria , acquired at the time of the Renaissance , and the works of Archimedes , made generally available in translation in 1543 , represent the last pocket of the science of antiquity which was recovered in time to be an ingredient or a factor in the formation of our modern science . As we have already seen , this was a body of knowledge which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to recover before all the components of the scientific movement could be assembled together and the autonomous efforts of scientific enquirers ? of a new crowd of pioneers in research ? could properly be put into gear . And it is remark-  | able how quickly things began to move , once all the ingredients , so to speak , had at last been collected together . Early in the seventeenth century , as we have already seen , the ancient explanation of the universe ? the framework of existing science ? was palpably breaking down . There was beginning to emerge what contemporaries clearly recognised as a scientific revolution , and what to us is the dawn of modern science . Now , if we are seeking to understand this birth of modern science we must not imagine that everything is explained by the resort to an experimental mode of procedure , or even that experiments were any great novelty . It was commonly argued , even by the enemies of the Aristotelian system , that that system itself could never have been founded except on the footing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of those university teachers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries who still clung to the old routine and went on commentating too much ( in what we might call a " literary " manner ) upon the works of the ancient writers . We may be surprised to note , however , that in one of the dialogues of Galileo , it is Simplicius , the spokesman of the Aristotelians ? the butt of the whole piece ? who defends the experimental method of Aristotle against what is described as the mathematical method of Galileo . And elsewhere it is the man speaking as the mouthpiece of Galileo himself who says that though Aristotle only gives reasoning to prove that such and such a thing must be the case , still this is only Aristotle 's way of demonstrating the thesis ? the actual discovery of it must have been the result of experiment . We have already seen how the medical students and the medical university of Padua were ahead of most other people in their regard for experiment , and the most remarkable result of the experimental method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is William Harvey 's treatise on the circulation of the blood . Yet it was not in the biological sciences that the Aristotelian way of attacking the problem was to receive its spectacular overthrow . It was not there that the scientific revolution found its centre or its pivot ? on the contrary , we shall have to study  | later the effects of the scientific revolution as they come by reflection , so to speak ( and at a second remove ) , upon the biological and other sciences . What is more remarkable still is the fact that the science in which experiment reigned supreme ? the science which was centred in laboratories even before the beginning of modern times ? was remarkably slow , if not the slowest of all , in reaching its modern form . It was long before alchemy became chemistry , and chemistry itself became in the full sense of the word quantitative in its method , instead of being qualitative , after the manner of ancient science . It may be interesting in this connection to glance at what perhaps is the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of science declared in 1923 to be " one of the outstanding achievements of scientific history " . It comes from the vague story of a disciple and a somewhat romantic biographer of Galileo , who said that his teacher had dropped two bodies of different weights from the tower of Pisa to prove that Aristotle was wrong in his view that they would fall at paces proportional to their weights . Later historians of science filled in the details , so that in a work published in 1918 the final precision was attained , and we learn how this martyr of science climbed the leaning tower of Pisa with a one-hundred-pound cannon ball under one arm and a one-pound ball under the other . Even Dr. Singer repeated the story in 1941 in his history of science , where he calls it " the most famous of experiments " and attributes it to the year 1591 . None of the vast crowd who are supposed to have observed the experiment gave any evidence on its behalf ? though , as we shall see , there was a particular reason why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witnesses ? and the writings of Galileo give no confirmation of the story . On the contrary , the writings of Galileo showed that he had tried the experiment several times in his youth with the opposite result ? he said in one of his juvenile works that he had tested the matter on many occasions from a high tower and that in his experience a lump of lead would very soon leave a lump of wood behind . The supposed experiment had actually been tried by another  | scientist , Simon Stevin of Bruges , and was recorded in a book published in 16os . Stevin , however , dropped balls of lead only from a height of thirty feet , and , considering how little was known in those days about the effects of such things as airresistance , the Aristotelians were perhaps not unreasonable in saying that the result was not conclusive ? you needed to try the experiment from a great height . Galileo , who in his youth indulged in curious speculations concerning the behaviour of falling bodies , ought to have been in a position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his early works , he had even insisted that it was useless to drop bodies from the top of a tower ? the height would need to be doubled before it was possible to form a proper judgment , he said . To crown the comedy , it was an Aristotelian , Coresio , who in 1612 claimed that previous experiments had been carried out from too low an altitude . In a work published in that year he described how he had improved on all previous attempts ? he had not merely dropped bodies from a high window , he had gone to the very top of the tower of Pisa . The larger body had fallen more quickly than the smaller one on this occasion , and the experiment , he claimed , had proved Aristotle to have been right all the time . Coresio 's work was published in Florence , and it does not appear that either Galileo or anybody else challenged the truth of the assertion , though the date is long after that of the alleged incident in the life of Galileo . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been gradually approaching the settlement of the problem on different lines altogether . At first they had moved timidly and had argued that different weights of the same substance would fall simultaneously ; though there might be a difference in pace , they said , if the comparison were between different substances altogether . Galileo , in fact , uses the argument employed by his predecessors ? they had reasoned that two tiles each weighing a pound and dropped at the same moment would fall to the ground at precisely the same time . Fastened together , end to end , they would still descend at the pace at which they had  | fallen when dropped merely side by side . And if one were fastened on the top of the other , still it would not press down more heavily than before , and therefore it would do nothing to press its lower partner to fall any more quickly either . In other words , the predecessors of Galileo had reasoned their way to the answer to this particular problem , and neither they nor Galileo showed any willingness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to confirm their judgment . In his youth Galileo had held the view for a time that falling bodies did not accelerate ? at least , they only accelerated at the beginning of their fall , he said , until they got into proper going form . Even on this point he was not to be put off by mere observation . It was in this connection that he refused to be deterred by the results of an experiment made from a tower , and said that it would be necessary to drop things from twice that height before the experiment could be regarded as decisive . As an appendix to the whole story I may note the existence of a controversy on the question whether Aristotle himself held the views for which this crucial experiment was supposed to have brought him into discredit . The matter is irrelevant , however , as at any rate the Aristotelians of the seventeenth century held these views and accepted the issue as a fair one . In connection with this and many similar problems , it would be somewhere near the truth if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been considerable comment on what are called the " thought-experiments " of Galileo . In some of his works one can hardly fail to notice the way in which he would assert : " If you were to do this thing , then this other particular thing would happen " ; and on some occasions it would appear to be the case that he was wrong in his inference ? on some occasions nobody stops to worry if one of the parties in the dialogues even makes the point that the experiment has never been tried . It is curious also how often Galileo makes use of these " thought-experiments " in regard to those points of mechanics that affect the question of the rotation of the earth ? how often he resorts to them when he is meeting the argu-  | ments that were the chief stock-in-trade of the Aristotelians . He discusses what would happen if you were to drop a stone from the top of the mast of a ship ( a ) when the vessel was moving and ( b ) when the vessel was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensation was caused by Gassendi , who actually tried the experiment and published the result , which on this occasion confirmed the thesis of Galileo . There was in France a younger contemporary and admirer of Galileo , called Mersenne , who , though a disciple of the great Italian in mechanics , was unable to feel convinced by the arguments which had been put forward in favour of the rotation of the earth . He came across Galileo 's " thought-experiments " in this field and on one occasion after another we find him making the significant comment : " Yes , only the experiment has never been tried . " As , later , he began to show himself more sympathetic to the Copernican point of view , Mersenne revealed that even now it was a different form of reasoning that appealed to him ? a type of argument belonging to a period long before the time of Galileo . He said : " If I could be convinced that God always did things in the shortest and easiest way , then I should certainly have to recognise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is most significant , and its achievements are the most remarkable , in the fields of astronomy and mechanics . In the former realm the use of experiment in any ordinary sense of the word can hardly be expected to have had any relevance . In regard to the latter we may recall what we observed when we were dealing with the problem of motion ? how it seemed reasonable to say that the great achievement was due to a transposition taking place in the mind of the enquirer himself . Here was a problem which only became manageable when in a certain sense it had been " geometrised " , so that motion had come to be envisaged as occurring in the emptiness of Archimedean space . Indeed , the modern law of inertia ? the modern picture of bodies continuing their motion in a straight line and away to infinity ? was hardly a thing which the human mind would ever reach by an experiment , or by any attempt  | to make observation more photographic , in any case . It depended on the trick of seeing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was empty and neutral ? utterly indifferent to what was happening ? like a blank sheet of paper , equally passive whether we draw on it a vertical or a horizontal line . In the case of the Aristotelian system the situation had been different ? it had always been impossible to forget that certain parts of the universe had a special " pull " . There were certain directions which it was fundamental to regard as privileged directions . All lines tended to be attracted to the centre of the earth . Under this system it was not possible to make the required abstraction , and , for example , to draw a simple straight line to represent a body flying off at a tangent ? flying off with determination and rectitude into infinite space . It was necessary that the line should curl round to the bottom of the paper , for the very universe was pulling it down , dragging the body all the time towards the centre of the earth . At this point even Galileo was imperfect . He did not attain the full conception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is why he failed to achieve the perfect formulation of the modern law of inertia , for he believed that the law of inertia applied to motion in a circle ; and here he was wrong ? what we call " inertial motion " must be movement along a straight line . When he talked of a perfectly spherical ball riding off to infinity on a perfectly smooth horizontal plane , he showed his limitations ; for he regarded the horizontal plane as being equidistant from the centre of the earth , and pictured it as a plane that actually went round the earth ; so that he could seize upon even this as a form of circular motion . And , though he was not fmally unaware of the fact that a body might fly off from the circular course at a tangent , in general he was perhaps a little too " Copernican " even in his mechanics ? a little too ready to regard circular motion as the " natural " kind of motion , the thing which did not require to be explained . In reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was precisely this circular motion which became " violent " motion in the Aris-  | totelian sense of the word . The stone that is swung round in a sling requires a constant force to draw it to the centre , and needs the exertion of violence to keep it in a circular path and prevent it from flying off at a tangent . The men who succeeded Galileo made a cleaner affair of this business of geometrising a problem , and drew their diagrams in a space more free , more completely empty , and more thoroughly neutral . We can see at times how the new science had to dispose of mental obstructions in the achievement of this task , as when the two vertical sides of a balance were assumed to be parallel and the objection was raised that they must meet at the centre of the earth . It was easy to reply : " Very well , let us leave the centre of the earth out of the picture , let us suspend the balance up in the sky , far above the sun itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary . Then we can be satisfied that the lines are really parallel . " If there was a threat that the diagram should be spoiled by the operation of gravity they would say : " Away with gravity ! Let us imagine the body placed in heaven , where there is neither up nor down ? where up and down , in fact , are as indifferent as right and left . " It was possible to argue : " Surely God can put a body in totally empty space , and we can watch it moving where there is nothing in the universe to attract or repel or in any way interfere with it . " The Aristotelian system had never been conducive to such a policy , which was necessary for the " geometrising " of problems , and which rendered science itself more amenable to a mathematical mode of treatment . It had not even been conducive to such a simple thing as " the parallelogram of forces " , though Simon Stevin may not have been absolutely original when he produced this device while Galileo was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea of the composition of motions , and was uncongenial to any mathematical treatment of the path which a body would follow when one motion happened to be complicated by another . We have seen how , in the case of projectiles , the Peripatetics had been unwilling to consider a mixture of  | motions , and had preferred to regard the body as driving forwards in a straight line until that motion was spent , and then quickly turning to drop vertically to the ground . It had been the new school which had begun to curve the path of the moving body and produced the view that in the mathematical world ( which for a time they confused with the real world ) the projectile described a parabola . And they worked out by mathematics the angle at which a gun must stand in order to fire the farthest ; leaving their conclusion to be tested afterwards by actual experiment . All this helps to explain why Galileo could be in the position of defending what he called the mathematical method even against the experimental system of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francis Bacon , for all his love of experiments , was in a certain sense inadequate for the age , and proved to be open to criticism in the seventeenth century because of his deficiency in mathematics . In a certain sense he saw the importance of mathematics ? the necessity of making calculations on the results of experiments in physics , for example ? and on one occasion he even made an emphatic statement in regard to this matter . What he lacked was the geometer 's eye , the power to single out those things which could be measured , and to turn a given scientific problem into a question of mathematics . It was the extension of the new method that was to prove exceptionally important , however . Having conceived of motion in its simplest form ? motion as taking place in this empty directionless space where nothing whatever could interfere with it and no resisting medium could put a check on it ? the modern school could then reverse the process and collect back the things they had thrown away . Or , rather , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these things into their geometrised world and make them amenable to the same kind of mathematical treatment . Things like air-resistance , which had been read out of the diagram at the first stage of the argument , could now be . brought back into the picture , but brought back in a different way ? no longer as despots but as subjugated servants . These things themselves were now caught  | into the mathematical method and turned into problems of geometry ; and the same mode of treatment could be applied to the problem of gravity itself . The very method which the new science had adopted was one that directed the mind to more fields of enquiry and suggested new lines of experiment ? attracting the student to things that would never have caught the attention of the Aristotelian enquirer . And the new avenues which were opened up in this way , even for experiment , were to carry the natural sciences away from that world of common-sense phenomena and ordinary appearances in which not only the Aristotelians but also the theorists of the impetus had done so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to be constantly directed in future to those things ? and was to apply itself to those problems ? which were amenable to measurement and calculation . Galileo therefore spoke very much to the point when he said that shape , size , quantity and motion were the primary qualities which the scientist should seek to examine when he was enquiring into given bodies . Tastes , colours , sounds and smells were a matter of comparative indifference to him ? they would not exist , he asserted , if human beings had not possessed noses and ears , tongues and eyes . In other words , science was to confine its attention to those things which were capable of measurement and calculation . Other objects which might be unamenable to such mathematical treatment in the first instance might still in the course of time be resolved into the same fundamentals . They might be translated or transposed into something else , and so , at a later stage of the argument , might become capable of being measured and weighed in turn . In any case , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not cause us to overlook a matter of which the seventeenth century itself was clearly conscious ? namely , the importance of mathematics in the developments that were taking place . When the interpretation of the whole scientific revolution is in question , certain facts which seem to have a bearing upon this issue strike the outsider as peculiarly significant . We have already met with a  | number of important aspirations and developments that belong to the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries ? hints of a more modern kind of mechanics for example , foreshadowings of analytical geometry , discussions which seem to point towards what we call mathematical physics , and even intuitions concerning the value of the purely quantitative method in the natural sciences . We are told , however , that these interesting developments were brought to a halt , apparently because the middle ages lacked the necessary mathematics ? the world had to wait until more of the mathematics of the ancient world had been recovered at the Renaissance . It would appear that there can exist a case of what might be called stunted development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked , almost before it has cut any ice , if one of the requisite conditions happens to be lacking for the time being . In a similar way , we learn that Kepler 's discovery of the laws of planetary motion was made possible only by the fact that he inherited and developed further for himself the study of conic sections , a study in which he was famous in his day . And certainly Tycho Brahe 's astronomical observations became a revolutionary factor in history only when the mathematical mind of a Kepler had set to work upon that collection of materials . At a later date the same phenomenon recurs and we learn that the problem of gravitation would never have been solved ? the whole Newtonian synthesis would never have been achieved ? without , first , the analytical geometry of Rene Descartes and , secondly , the infinitesimal calculus of Newton and Leibnitz . Not only , then , did the science of mathematics make a remarkable development in the seventeenth century , but in dynamics and in physics the sciences give the impression that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Without the achievements of the mathematicians the scientific revolution , as we know it , would have been impossible . It was true in general that where geometrical and mathematical methods could be easily and directly applied ? as possibly in optics ? there was very considerable development in the seventeenth century . In the period we have now reached  | ? in the age of Galileo ? arithmetic and algebra had attained something like their modern external appearance ? the Frenchman , Francois Viete , for example , had established the use of letters to represent numbers ; the Fleming , Simon Stevin , was introducing the decimal system for representing fractions ; various symbols , now familiar to students , were coming into use between the fifteenth century and the time of Descartes . At the same time aids to mathematical calculation ? a matter of importance to students of the heavenly bodies ? were being created , such as John Napier 's logarithms , developed between 1595 and 1614 , and other devices for simplifying multiplication and division ? the " bones " , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had greater renown even than his logarithms . It has been pointed out that as algebra and geometry had developed separately ? the former amongst the Hindus and the latter amongst the Greeks ? the marriage of the two , " the application of algebraic methods to the geometric field " , was " the greatest single step ever made in the progress of the exact sciences " . The crucial development here came to its climax in the time of Descartes . Descartes put forward the view that sciences involving order and measure ? whether the measure affected numbers , forms , shapes , sounds or other objects ? are related to mathematics . " There ought therefore to be a general science ? namely , mathematics , " he said , " which should explain all that can be known about order and measure , considered independently of any application to a particular subject . " Such a science , he asserted , would surpass in utility and importance all the other sciences , which in reality depended upon it . Kepler said that just as the ears are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind of man is meant to consider quantity and it wanders in darkness when it leaves the realm of quantitative thought . Galileo said that the book of the universe was written in mathematical language , and its alphabet consisted of triangles , circles and geometrical figures . There is no doubt that , , in both Kepler and Galileo , Platonic and Pythagorean influences played an important part in the story .  | If all these things are kept in mind we can see why the resort to experiment in the natural sciences now came to have direction , came at last to be organised to some purpose . For centuries it had been an affair of wild and almost pointless fluttering ? a thing in many respects irrelevant to the true progress of understanding ? sometimes the most capricious and fantastic part of the scientific programme . There had been men in the middle ages who had said that experiment was the thing that mattered , or had realised that behind the natural philosophy of the Greeks there had been experiment and observation in the first place . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century a man like Sir Francis Bacon , who harped on the need for experiments but failed to hitch this policy on to that general mathematising mode of procedure which I have described , was early recognised to have missed the point . In the thirteenth century , a writer called Peregrine produced a work on the magnet , and many of his experiments prepared the way for the remarkable book on the magnet produced by William Gilbert in 1600 . The chief influence that came from Gilbert 's book , however , emerged from his cosmic speculations based on the thesis that the earth was itself a great magnet , and Sir Francis Bacon was ready to seize upon the fact that this was not a hypothesis demonstrated by experiment , the thesis did not arise in the appointed way out of the experiments themselves . Even Leonardo da Vinci had tended to cast around here and there , like a schoolboy interested in everything , and when he drew up a plan of experiments in advance ? as in the case of his projected scheme of study on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that here are experiments , but not the modern experimental method . Neither the medieval period nor the Renaissance was lacking in the ingenuity or the mechanical skill for modern technical achievement , as can be seen from the amazing contrivances they produced even where no urgent utilitarian purpose provided the incentive . Yet it is not until the seventeenth century that the resort to experiments comes to be tamed and harnessed so to speak , and is brought under direction , like a great machine getting into gear .  | Even when one is interested in the scientific revolution primarily as a transformation in thought , one can not ignore those wider changes in the world which affect man 's thinking or alter the conditions under which this thinking takes place . It is coming to be realised that the history of technology plays a larger part in the development of the scientific movement than it was once understood to do ; and in fact the history of science is bound to be imperfect if it is regarded too exclusively as the history of scientific books . Some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to locate , as yet , and might well be difficult to prove . But apart from the transference of ideas and techniques , there must have been an appreciable effect of a subtle kind upon the way in which problems were tackled and upon man 's feeling . for things , his feeling perhaps even for matter itself . A series of famous sixteenth-century books has put on record the technical progress which had then been achieved in various fields ? in mining and metallurgy , for example ; and some of this work must be regarded as preparing the way for modern chemistry , which it would be wrong to imagine as springing out of alchemy alone . On this technical side , and especially in the field of mechanics and hydrostatics , there is no doubt that Archimedes had a further influence on the course of the scientific revolution ? we may almost regard him as the patron saint of the mechanically-minded and of the modern experimenters in physics . At first there was a considerable gulf between the practical man and the theorisers . The navigators would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any experience of the sea . Those who worked out the trajectory of projectiles , or the appropriate angle of fire , might be far removed from the men who actually fired the guns in time of war . The map-makers , the surveyors , the engineers had long required some mathematics , however ; the Portuguese discoverers had needed science to help them when they sailed south of the equator ; William Gilbert had associated with navigators ; and Galileo speaks of the kind of problems which arose in the ship-building yards at Venice , or in connection  | with the handling of artillery , and the pumping of water in mines . Indeed , it is proper to picture Galileo as passing his time in a sort of workshop with trained mechanics as his assistants , for ever making things ? even making things for sale ? and carrying out experiments , so that in him the mechanic or artisan combined with the philosopher to produce a modern type of scientist . It has been argued that the growing number of mechanical objects in the world at large had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude of mind ? an interest in the sheer question of the way in which things worked , and a disposition to look upon nature with the same preoccupation . Apart from the famous cases in which a strategic experiment might bring the solution of a particular problem , Galileo gives the impression of having experimented so constantly as to gain an intimacy with movement and structures ? he has watched the ways of projectiles , the operation of levers and the behaviour of balls on inclined planes , until he seems to know them , so to speak , from the inside in the way that some men know their dogs . And clocks worked by wheels were still a surprisingly new thing in the world when there appeared in the fourteenth century the suggestion that the heavenly bodies might be like a piece of clockwork . The early propaganda on behalf of the scientific movement laid remarkable stress on the utilitarian results that were expected from it ; and this was one of the grounds on which the scientists or the scientific societies called for the patronage of kings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the technical needs of the age and the preoccupations of scientific enquirers , even when the precise connection escapes us or is hard to locate ? as in the case of ballistics in the sixteenth century and hydraulic problems , perhaps , in the seventeenth . Much of the attention of the Royal Society in its early years was actually directed to problems of practical utility . And for a remarkably long period one of the topics constantly presented to the technicians and scientists was a matter of urgent necessity ? the question of the finding of a satisfactory way of measuring longitude . It is not sur-  | prising that much of the work of students in our time has been turned to the history of technology . One thing becomes significant in the seventeenth century and that is the creation of scientific instruments , especially measuring instruments ; and it is hard for us to realise how difficult things must have been in earlier centuries without them . The telescope and the microscope appear at the very beginning of the century ? and may have been devised a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a by-product of the glass- and metal-polishing industries in Holland . The microscope proved to be inadequate , however , for a long time , owing apparently to a defect , not in industrial technique as such , but in the actual science of optics . A more powerful single lens was produced , however , in the middle of the century , and much of the important work in the later period was really done with that . Galileo represents an important stage in the development of the thermometer and the pendulum-clock ; and the barometer appears in the middle of the century ; but for a long time it was possible to detect just the fact that the tempera . ture was changing without having a reliable scale for the actual measurement of temperature . A really accurate thermometer did not exist until the eighteenth century . In the middle of the seventeenth century , again we meet with the momentous discovery of the air-pump , and only after this time do we see the use of the blow-pipe in chemical analysis . Van Helmont in the earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas , and found that different kinds of gases existed ? not simply air ? but he was greatly handicapped , as he had no means of collecting and isolating a particular gas that he might want to examine , nor did he achieve our modern conception of what is a " gas " . When one considers the richness and the fantastic nature of the objects that littered the laboratory of the alchemist even in the sixteenth century , one may feel that it can hardly have been the lack of industrial technique which delayed the appearance of some of the modern scientific instruments ; though it appears that where purity or accuracy was highly necessary , either in the glass or in the metal-work ,  | the technical progress achieved by the seventeenth century is a factor that affects the case . We may gather from repeated statements in books and correspondence that the experimental method in the first half of the seventeenth century involved a serious financial burden on its practitioners . Later in the century , when the informal gatherings of scientific workers turned into scientific societies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sciences in France ( and similar bodies earlier still in Italy ) , these societies helped to bear the expense of experiments . Their publications , and the establishment of a periodical literature , speeded up still more the communication and collation of scientific results . It would seem not to have been until the middle of the century that scientific publications really took the form of the communication of actual experiments . Sometimes , as in the works of Galileo , a point would be demonstrated by reasoning , though possibly it had been discovered in the course of experiment first of all .  | BACON AND DESCARTES IT is comparatively easy for people today to accommodate their minds to changes that may take place in upper regions of the different sciences ? changes which from year to year may add further weight to the curriculum of the undergraduate student of the subject . It is not clear what the patriarchs of our generation would do , however , if we were faced with such a tearing-up of the roots of science that we had to wipe out as antiquated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elementary school ? if we had even to invert our attitudes , and deal , for example , with the whole question of local motion by picking up the opposite end of the stick . The early seventeenth century was more conscious than we ourselves ( in our capacity as historians ) of the revolutionary character of the moment that had now been reached . While everything was in the melting-pot ? the older order undermined but the new scientific system unachieved ? the conflict was bitterly exasperated . Men were actually calling for a revolution ? not merely for an explanation of existing anomalies but for a new science and a new method . Programmes ofthe revolutionary movement were put forward , and it is clear that some men were highly conscious of the predicament in which the world now found itself . They seemed to be curiously lacking in discernment in one way , however , for they tended to believe that the scientific revolution could be carried out entirely in a single lifetime . It was a case of changing one lantern-slide of the universe for another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the place of Aristotle 's . Gradually they found that it would need not merely one generation but perhaps two to complete the task . By the close of the seventeenth century they had come to see that they had opened the way to an indefinitely expanding future , and that the sciences were only in their cradle still .  | Before the seventeenth century had opened , the general state of knowledge in regard to the physical universe had been conducive to the production of a number of speculative systems ? these not founded upon scientific enquiry as a rule , but generally compounded out of ingredients taken from classical antiquity . Already in the sixteenth century , also , attention had been directed to the question of a general scientific method , and in the seventeenth century this problem of method came to be one of the grand preoccupations , not merely of the practising scientist , but , at a higher level , amongst the general thinkers and philosophers . The principal leaders in this seventeenth-century movement were Francis Bacon in the first quarter of the century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to a set of regulations ; and Descartes , whose work belongs chiefly to the second quarter of the century and who differed from Bacon not only in his glorification of mathematics as the queen of the sciences , but in the emphasis which he placed on a deductive and philosophical mode of reasoning , which he claimed to have screwed up to such a degree of tightness that it possessed all the discipline and certainty of mathematical reasoning . In the time of Newton and well into the eighteenth century , there was a grand controversy between an English school , which was popularly identified with the empirical method , and a French school , which glorified Descartes and came to be associated rather with the deductive method . In the middle of the eighteenth century , however , the French , with a charm that we must describe as Mediterranean , not only submitted to the English view of the matter , but in their famous Encyclopedia made even too ample a return , placing Bacon on a pedestal higher perhaps than any that had been given him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or charity brought some confusion into historical science at a later stage in the story . Attacks on Aristotle had been increasingly common and sometimes exceedingly bitter in the sixteenth century . In 1543 ? a year which we have already seen to be so important  | in connection with Copernicus and Vesalius as well as the revival of Archimedes ? Pierre Ramus produced his famous Animadversions on Aristotle . This work , which was known to Francis Bacon , and which attacked Aristotle without ever really understanding him , proposed an alternative method which was rather that of a humanist and professor of Belles Lettres ? namely , studying nature through the best writers , and then applying deductive and syllogistic procedures to the result . In 1581 another writer , Francois Sanchez , produced a further attack on Aristotle , and more particularly on the modern followers of Aristotle ? a work which provides a remarkable anticipation of Descartes . He said : I questioned the learned men of bygone centuries ; then I consulted those who were my contemporaries . . . but none of their replies was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; put everything to doubt , as though I had never been told anything by anybody . I began to examine things myself in order to discover the true way of gaining knowledge ? Hence the thesis which is the starting-point of my reflections : the more I think , the more I doubt . He attacked the syllogistic reasoning of the prevalent Aristotelian school , because it turned men away from the study of reality and encouraged them to play a sophistical game of verbal subtlety . He promised to expound the true method of science , but in the fifty years of life that were left to him he never fulfilled the promise . One participant in the controversies over scientific method , Everard Digby , was teaching Logic in the University of Cambridge when Francis Bacon was there in his youth ; and a German scholar has shown that at certain points Bacon appears to have followed the ideas of this man . Bacon held that if Adam , owing to the Fall , had lost for the human race that domination over the created world which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a subordinate command over nature , available if men worked  | sufficiently hard to secure it , though this had been thrown away by human folly . There had been only three short periods of genuine scientific progress throughout the whole course of human history , he said ? one in Greek times , one in the Roman period , and the third which was being enjoyed in the seventeenth century . In each of the two ancient periods the era of scientific progress had been confined to two hundred years . The earlier Greek philosophers had set the course of enquiry on the right lines , but Plato and Aristotle had supervened , and they had come to prevail precisely because , being of lighter weight , they had managed to ride much farther down upon the stream of time . They had survived the storms of the Barbarian Invasions precisely because they had been shallow and buoyant , and Aristotle , in particular , had owed his remarkable sway in the world to the fact that , like the Ottoman sultans , he had pursued the policy of destroying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages , they had had " subtle and strong capacities , abundance of leisure , and but small variety of reading , their minds being shut up in a few authors " ; and therefore they had " with infinite agitation of wit , spun out of a small quantity of matter those laborious webs of learning which are extant in their books " . Bacon was impressed by the fact that scientific knowledge had made such extraordinarily little progress since the days of antiquity . He begins by saying that men ought to " throw aside all thought of philosophy , or at least to expect but little and poor fruit from it , until an approved and careful natural and Experimental History be prepared and constructed " . For to what purpose are these brain-creations and idle display of power .. : . All these invented systems of the universe , each according to his own fancy are like so many arguments of plays ... every one philosophises out of the cells of his own imagination , as out of Plato 's cave . He uses the term " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we speak of natural history , and he regards it as comprising a collection of data , the fruits of enquiry .  | He believed that many men had been led away by allowing their scientific work to become entangled in a search for final causes , which really belonged rather to philosophy , and which he said corrupted the sciences , except those relating to the intercourse of man with man . In education he thought that scholars were introduced too early to logic and rhetoric , which were the cream of the sciences since they arranged and methodised the subject-matter of all the others . To apply the juvenile mind to these before it had been confronted with the subject-matter of the other sciences was like painting and measuring the wind , he said ? on the one hand it degraded logic into childish sophistry , on the other hand it had the effect of making the more concrete sciences superficial . In his reaction against the older ways of discussing science , Bacon carried the attack beyond the bounds of prudence on occasion ? denying the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern philosopher would disapprove of ; though the general line of attack was understandable , and very useful in view of the situation of things at that time . Bacon wanted men to close in on nature and get to grips with her , bringing their minds to mix in its actual operations . " The secrets of nature " , he said , " betray themselves more readily when tormented by art than when left to their own course . " " It is best to consider matter , its conformation , and the changes of that conformation , its own action , and the law of this action in motion . " He did not support a dead kind of empiricism ; the empirics , he said , were like ants merely heaping up a collection of data . The natural philosophers still generally current in the world , however , were rather like spiders spinning their webs out of their own interior . He thought that the scientists ought to take up an intermediate position , like that of the bees , which extracted matter from the flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpretations of nature , he said , were generally " founded on too narrow a basis of experiment " . " In any case " , he insisted , " the present method of experiment is blind and stupid " ? men did it as though they were schoolboys engaged " as it were in sport " . He talked of  | " desultory , ill-combined experiment " . The alchemists , he said , had theoretical preconceptions which hindered them from either carrying out their experiments along useful lines or extracting anything important from their results . Men in general glanced too hastily at the result of an experiment , and then imagined that the rest could be done by sheer contemplation ; or they would fly off into the skies with a hasty first impression and attempt to make this square with the vulgar notions already existing in their minds . Even Gilbert working on the magnet had no unity or order in his experiments ? the only unity in his treatise lay in the fact that he had been ready to try out anything that there was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's firm principle that if men wanted to achieve anything new in the world , it was of no use attempting to reach it on any ancient method ? they must realise that new practices and policies would be necessary . He stressed above all the need for the direction of experiments ? an end to the mere haphazard experimenting ? and he insisted that something far more subtle and far-reaching could be achieved by the proper organisation of experiments . It is quite clear that he realised how science could be brought to a higher power altogether by being transported away from that ordinary world of commonsense phenomena in which so much of the discussion had hitherto been carried on . He insisted on the importance of the actual recording of experiments , a point which , as we have already seen , was now coming to be of some significance . He urged that experimenters in different fields should get together , because they would knock sparks off one another ; and things done in one field would give hints to people working in another field . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how , precisely in this period , the knowledge of several different branches of science at once might have an enriching effect on each . Also , suggestions which are scattered in various parts of Bacon 's work seem to have served as an inspiration to some of the men who founded the Royal Society .  | It often happens that when the philosopher comes to deal with the position of a man like Bacon in the history of thought , he lays great stress either upon the internal inconsistencies that may exist in the intellectual system in question , or on the actual correctness ? from a modem point of view ? of the man 's conclusions , which in the present case would mean the correctness of Bacon 's predictions concerning the character and the method which modem science was going to take upon itself . A modem critic may lay about him right and left on the subject of the philosophy of the nineteenth-century Utilitarians , if that teaching merits the name of philosophy ; but the historian who remembers all the inhibitions that restricted parliamentary action at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind the vast flood of legislation that began to appear in the second quarter of that century , can hardly help realising that on a lower level altogether ? in a sub-philosophical field ? it required a first-class campaign to get rid of the inhibitions and to persuade people of the commonplace fact that laws could be regarded as mere ministers to ordinary utility , that anachronistic legislation was not a thing to be preserved for semi-mystical reasons . It is at this lower level of analysis  --  in this sub-philosophical realm ? that Bacon is so interesting and so important in history , and we must not ask ourselves : How many people adopted the Baconian system literally and in toto ? We must not be surprised that even in the seventeenth century it was precisely the people in the same line of thought as Bacon ? the logicians ? who were the least influenced by his teaching . We must not be disconcerted if even at the very heart of his teaching , where he purported to show exactly how the results of experiments could be turned into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended to be , and on occasion actually mistaken . In the days when the grand campaign against Aristotle was coming to its height he produced a programme and manifesto , and some of the most important things that he said are dead to us but were quivering with life in the seventeenth century , because they were right and so happen to have become commonplaces to-  | day . Ile did not produce Baconians taking over his whole system , but rather stimulated people in a piecemeal way ? people who apparently did not always even read his works in their entirety . And since authors who merely write about method are liable to mistakes which are avoided by men who are actually engaged in research ( for the simple reason that the latter can often hardly help following their noses half the time ) , it is not surprising if some people thought they were disciples of his method when in reality they were doing something different , something which in many cases would be better still . In his own words , " he rang the bell which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aphorisms ? especially where he is diagnosing the causes of common errors in thought ? would give both profit and stimulus to students of history today . Paradoxically enough , there is possibly some truth in the view that the Baconian influence has been most direct in some of what might be called the literary sciences . He has been attacked because there is so much in his writing that savours of the old Aristotle ; but that was necessary since his system ranged over all the realms of thought and philosophy . He has been mocked because so many of his beliefs about nature were still medieval ? but that was also true of the various scientists of the time . If he believed in the existence of vital spirits in the blood , so did William Harvey himself , as we have seen . If he described inanimate things as having aspirations and dispositions , or as being drawn by affection to one another , Robert Boyle , much later in the century , explicitly defended this mode of expression . He has been criticised because when he collected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with established scientific facts . He instructed scientific workers to examine the fables , however , and repeatedly he made the point that he expected to find his data corrected by enquiries that would take place in the future . When he set out to provide a starting-point for scientific enquiry , and to assemble his catalogues of known facts , achieved experiments and suggested hypotheses , he made terrible mistakes , for he was writing before modern physics or  | chemistry or astronomy or physiology had really begun to be established . The mistaken science of the past always appears as blind superstition to the future , and Bacon at one point and another would fail to free himself from existing prejudices or , alternatively , to prevent his mind from running to fantastic conjecture . But he realised the possibility of error in advance , and said that it mattered little if his experiments were wrong , " since it must needs happen in beginnings " . He claimed that at any rate his compendiums were more useful than the scientific knowledge that had hitherto been available . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer hypotheses for people to examine ; even if they were wrong they would be useful , he said . On one occasion he noted that it was too early to put forward an opinion on a given issue , but he would offer his own for the time being because it might seem like cowardice if he did not . On another occasion he said : I do not pronounce upon anything , I set down and prescribe but only provisionally . . . I sometimes make attempts at interpretation . . . but what need have I of pride or imposture seeing that I so often declare that we are not furnished with so much history or experiments as we want and that without these the interpretation of nature can not be accomplished ; and that therefore it is enough for me if I set the thing on foot . If we look for the root of the error that was in him ? the cause that was perhaps behind the other causes ? it lay in his assumption that the number of phenomena , the number even of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution could be expected to take place in a decade or two . " The particular phenomena of the arts and sciences are in reality but as a handful " , he once said ; " the invention of all causes and sciences would be the labour of but a few years . " He thought that he could make catalogues of facts , of required experiments and of suggested hypotheses ; and while on the  | one hand he imagined that the whole renovation of the sciences would be held up unless he provided this guide-book , he spoke at times as though , once his compendium had been compiled , the work of science would proceed almost by rule of thumb . Even here he was not so inelastic as some people have made out , however , and not so blind to the importance of hypotheses . If he thought it his special function to provide the hypotheses , he would add the remark that further ones would suggest themselves to the enquirer as he went along . He believed that out of experiments one could draw generalisations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to further experiments . In a curious but significant way he seems to have foreseen the structure that science was to take in the future ? a point which may best be illustrated perhaps by adapting an example suggested in a lecture by Professor Broad . Bacon thought that at the first immediate level the generalisations or axioms which might be drawn out of experiments were too low-grade , too near to concrete facts to be of any great utility . Knowledge is limited if we only know that heat can be produced by mixing sulphuric acid and water ; and the knowledge is of little value unless these two substances happen to be at hand . The very highest generalisations of all , however , are out of reach , too near to God and to final causes ; they must be left to the philosopher . The intermediate axioms are the ones that are " true , solid and full of life " , says Bacon ? the rather higher generalisations which can be reached by the method of climbing up to them from below . If one knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one is in possession of a wider form of generalisation and this will greatly increase one 's power over nature . Incidentally , Bacon makes the remark that there are some things which have become so familiar or which are accepted so automatically that people take them as self-evident , though they are just the things which are most in need of re-examination . In this connection he specifies the causes of gravity , the rotation of the heavenly bodies , heat , light , density and organic formation . He shows some insight in recognising that the progress of  | science would consist in the pursuit of enquiries upon lines such as these . It was on the mathematical side  --  and particularly , so to speak , on the geometrical side ? that Bacon missed the point of that kind of science which was to spring from Galileo . His error ought not to be exaggerated . He says in one place : " The investigation of nature is best conducted when mathematics are applied to physics . " He says in another place : " If physics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will continually be wanting fresh assistance from mathematics . " On the other hand , he regarded mathematics merely as the handmaid to physics , and actually complained of the dominion which it was beginning to exercise in that science . It was all very well to do sums on the results of one 's experiments , but Bacon specifically disliked Galileo 's method of turning the problem of motion , in the way we have seen , into the problem of geometrical bodies moving in geometrical space . Far from wanting to read away the air-resistance , in the way the new school of scientists were doing , he wanted to add other things to the picture ? for example , the tensions that were bound to take place within the moving body itself . Far from wanting to abstract and to isolate any aspect of a scientific problem , so that motion could be considered as a line drawn in geometrical space , he longed rather to load all the concreteness back into the problem , to see a picture which included air-resistance and gravity and the internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the celestial bodies he deprecated the purely geometrical study of motion and said that the enquirer ought not to overlook the question of the kind of material out of which the planets were manufactured . On the subject of projectiles he declined to accept either Aristotle 's theory that the motion was caused by the rush of air , or the impetus-theory which had hitherto been its principal rival . He put forward the hypothesis that if motion continued after an impact this was the result of the play of the internal forces and stresses which had been put into operation by the shock of the original percussion . Indeed , it is important in the study of Bacon not merely to  | know the skeleton of his system , but to observe how he treats the problems in any of the branches of science . And it is not sufficient to note whether he was right or wrong according to the views of the present day . We must know where each particular science stood at the time when he was writing , and exactly how he would play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which this matter may perhaps be usefully discussed at the present moment , since it is connected with problems which we have already traversed in a general way ; and that is , the field that relates to the problem of the skies . It is the more interesting from the fact that Bacon is so often summarily dismissed for his anti-Copernican prejudices . On this subject Bacon begins by saying : I will myself therefore construct a Theory of the Universe according to the measure of the history , the established facts , as yet known to us ; keeping my judgment however in all points free , for the time when history , and by means of history , my inductive philosophy shall have been further advanced . Later he says : Nevertheless I repeat once more that I do not mean to bind myself to these ; for in them as in other things I am certain of my way but not certain of my position . I have introduced them by way of interlude lest it be thought that it is from vacillation of judgment or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that many astronomical systems can be put forward which will cover the phenomena . The Ptolemaic is one , the Copernican is another . Either will account for the observed movements , but Bacon prefers the system of Tycho Brahe , the intermediate system by which some of the planets go round the sun and these all together go round the motionless earth . He regrets , however , that Tycho Brahe had not worked out the  | mathematics of such a system and shown its operation in detail . " Now it is easy to see " , he says , " that both they who think the earth revolves and they who hold the primum mobile and the old construction are about equally and indifferently supported by the phenomena . " He prefers , however , the view that the earth is stationary ? " for that I now think the truer opinion " , he says . Still , he puts the question as one for the reader to answer : Whether there is a system of the universe with a centre , or whether the particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each , as he says , " on its own roots " , or each as " so many islands in an immense sea " . Even if the earth revolves it does not necessarily follow that there is no system of the universe , he says ; for there are planets that do revolve round the sun . But though the rotation of the earth is an ancient idea , the Copernican view that the sun stands immovable at the centre of the universe is one which Bacon considers to be unprecedented . He is prepared to ask whether there may not be many different centres of the universe , the heavenly bodies being congregated in bundles or groups , so that he can picture them as separate parties of people each doing a separate dance . He addresses himself to the problem we discussed in connection with the modern doctrine of inertia when he says : " Let no one hope to determine the question whether the earth or heaven revolve in the diurnal motion unless he have first comprehended the nature of spontaneous rotation . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement of the earth because it would leave nature without any quiet , any immobility . Repeatedly he tells us that so far as the mathematical aspect is concerned the Copernican system is satisfactory , but he stumbles at the obstacle which we have seen to be the general difficulty even in the days of Galileo : the Copernican hypothesis has not yet been made to square with what is known of physical science in general . Bacon repeats that the **25;1154;TOOLONG can never solve the problem by themselves . Let the observation of the heavenly bodies proceed ? we are all the better if we can get the geometry of the skies correct ? and the mathematical side of the work must certainly  | be dovetailed into the discoveries of physical science . On the mathematical side things are going well at the moment , especially with the new optical instruments ; but there must be greater constancy of observation , greater severity of judgment , more witnesses to confirm observations , and each particular fact must be tested in different ways . The real weakness still lies in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the actual material the stars are made of , learn about the appetites and behaviour of the stuff itself , which must be fundamentally the same in all regions of the heavens . Bacon declines to accept the view that the heavenly bodies are formed of an immaculate substance free from change and exempt from the ordinary forces of nature . It was heathen arrogance , not the Holy Scripture , he says , which endowed the skies with the prerogative of being incorruptible . Also he tells us : " I shall not stand upon that piece of mathematical elegance , the reduction of motions to perfect circles . " Dispersed through his work are many references to Galileo 's telescopic discoveries . He accepts all the empirical data that these observations provide ; but he does not accept Galileo 's theories , though he does quote Galileo with approval for the view that the effect of gravity diminishes as one goes farther away from the earth . When he discusses the question of the tides , he says that on the supposition that the movement of the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he personally holds with Galileo 's theory on this subject . His own view is that the farthest skies and stars move rapidly in a perfect circle , but that as we come down nearer to earth the heavenly bodies themselves become more earthy and they move in a more resistant medium . Things becoming more heavy and gross as we approach the mundane region , their motion slows down in proportion as they are nearer to earth and hold a lower place in the skies . What appears to be the motion of the planets in one direction is merely the optical illusion produced by the fact that they are so much behind the highest skies and the farthest stars ; it merely represents a lag in that single circular movement which they are all supposed to share . Not  | only is the pace reduced , but the circular motion is departed from , as one comes lower down in the sky and nearer to the gross and material earth . The total result is to produce in the sky the effect of spirals , and Bacon affects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , since it represents an initial circular motion constantly going off the circle as it descends to more turgid realms . In his view the tides are the last weak effects of the total revolution of the skies around the motionless earth . That was Bacon 's system of the universe , though as we have already seen , it was a mere tentative hypothesis and he did not consider that the time had yet come for the production of a general synthesis . It is clear , however , that from the point of view of that time his work was essentially stimulating , especially in the signs it gave of an extraordinary elasticity of mind ; and that many people were influenced by it , though their work might not itself have a Baconian look at the finish ? his influence tended to make men better than himself , make them something better than mere Baconians . The numerous translations of his works into French in the first half of the seventeenth century show that he aroused great interest across the Channel . With Rene Descartes , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thought much more intensive and concentrated , and much more intricately interlocked . We shall find this man , like Galileo , reappearing in various aspects in the story of the scientific revolution , sprawling over the whole area that is left of the seventeenth century . What requires notice at the moment is merely the short treatise ? a thing almost of pamphlet size ? entitled A Discourse on Method , which is one of the really important books in our intellectual history . To the historian its greatest significance lies , not in its one or two philosophical passages or in the disquisition on mathematics , but in its aspect as just a piece of autobiography . In this aspect it influenced , not merely those who were to become Cartesian in philosophy , but the world in general . It was written in the vernacular , and Descartes meant to  | address himself to the natural reason of men whose minds had not been perverted by the traditions of the schools . Those who read the Discourse on Method , not profoundly as philosophers but superficially in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand , better than the philosophers ever do , the importance and the influence of Descartes in general history . More important perhaps than anything the author intended is the manner in which the book was misunderstood ; and Descartes himself complains not only in his letters but in this very book of the way in which he was being misunderstood already . He says in the Discourse that when he hears his own views repeated he finds them so changed that he can not recognise or acknowledge them as his ? a remark which must go straight to the heart of every author . He cries out against those people who think that they can master in a day the things which he had taken twelve years to think out . He explains in the Discourse how he had come to feel that all the sciences which he had been taught in his youth had really told him nothing ? how the various opinions to which men in different parts of the world were attached were so often merely the result of custom and tradition . The book is vivid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who after much travail decided that he must sweep away all ancient opinions and start all his thinking over again . Bacon had talked of the need of " minds washed clean of opinions " , but Descartes went further in his determination to unload himself of all the teaching which had been transmitted from the ancient world , his determination to doubt everything and start naked once again , without any foothold whatever save the consciousness that I who do the doubting must exist ? even though I may doubt whether I am doubting . Those who never understood the positive teaching of Descartes , and who could never have risen to his philosophy , appreciated this dramatic rejection of inherited systems and ideas . And though he himself said that the attempt to overthrow all tradition in this way was not a thing to be carried out by any and every man ; though he cautioned against any imitation of the  | sceptics ? for , in fact , he was only doubting in order to find a firmer basis for belief or certainty ? still the influence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be most significant on the destructive side and in the realm of general ideas . The misunderstanding of Descartes was made more easy , because , in fact , he did not intend his Discourse on Method to be anything more than a mere preface to his real study and survey of the problem of method . The essay was an introduction to three treatises ? the Dioptric , the Meteors and the Geometry , and it was the intention of Descartes to develop the idea of his method by illustrating it in action , showing how it operated in concrete cases ? that is to say , in different branches of science . It proved to be these three treatises that provided the greater sensation and drew the chief attention at the time ; but the world soon gets tired of reading out-of-date science , so that these parts of the work gradually lost their initial importance . The Discourse on Method , which is stimulating to read at any time , gradually detached itself from the essays to which it was a mere preface , and came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential capacity to see reason was distributed throughout the human race without any difference of degree , however clouded it might be by prejudice or by the illusions of the imagination . He established what became the great principle of common sense in modern times , for if he insisted on one point more than any other it was in his thesis : " All things which we clearly and distinctly conceive are true . " If I say " I think , therefore I am " , I am not really deducing anything ? I am announcing a kind of intuitive perception of myself , a perception which nothing can get behind . Beyond that , if I say " I have a body " , I am liable to be misled by pictures and fogs ? the visual imagination is precisely the thing that is unreliable . The people who say " I believe in my body because I can see it clearly , but I can not see God " were turning a popularised Descartes to the purpose exactly the reverse of what had been intended . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas that are clearer and more precise in the mind than anything seen by the actual  | eye . Furthermore , everything hung on this existence of a perfect and righteous God . Without Him a man could not trust in anything , could not believe in a geometrical proposition , for He was the guarantee that everything was not an illusion , the senses not a complete hoax , and life not a mere nightmare . Starting from this point , Descartes was prepared to deduce the whole universe from God , with each step of the argument as clear and certain as a demonstration in geometry . He was determined to have a science as closely knit , as regularly ordered , as any piece of mathematics ? one which , so far as the material universe is concerned ( and excluding the soul and the spiritual side of things ) , would lay out a perfect piece of mechanism . His vision of a single universal science so unified , so ordered , so interlocked , was perhaps one of his most remarkable contributions to the scientific revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said that one single mind ought to work out the whole system ? he indulged at one time in the hope that he might carry out the whole scientific revolution himself . When others offered to help him with experiments he was tempted to reply that it would be much better if they would give him money to carry out his own . The physics of Descartes , therefore , depends in a particular way upon his metaphysics ; it provides merely the lower stages in an hierarchical system that definitely reaches back to God . Descartes is prepared to work out a whole system of the universe , starting with matter ( or with what the philosophers call extension ) on the one hand , and movement , purely local motion , on the other . Everything was to be accounted for mathematically , either by configuration or by number . His universe , granting extension and movement in the first place , was so based on law that no matter how many different universes God had created ? no matter how different from one another these might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to become like the universe we live in , through the sheer operation of law upon the primary material . Even if God had created a different universe at the beginning , it would have worked itself round to the system that now exists . Even if He  | had made the earth a cube , it would have rolled itself into a sphere . Perhaps the most essential law in the physical system of Descartes was the law concerning the invariability in the amount of motion in the universe . Motion depended ultimately on God , and the law concerning the invariability in the amount of motion was a law which followed from the immutability of God . It might be thought that Descartes could have arrived at some such law by observation and experiment , or at least by taking it as a possible hypothesis and discovering that it actually succeeded , actually worked in practice . That would never have been sufficient for him , for it could never have provided that clinching demonstration , that exclusion of alternative possibilities , which it was the purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainty of a deductive and quasi-geometrical proof , and he had to carry the question back to God , so that his physics had to depend on his metaphysics . Envisaging the matter with the eye of the geometer , however , and conceiving motion therefore so largely in its kinematic aspect , he laid himself open to the criticism that his system suffered from anaemia in respect of questions relating to dynamics . His law on the subject of the conservation of momentum proved unsatisfactory and had to be replaced by the law of the conservation of energy . He tells us in the Discourse on Method that from one or two primary truths that he had established he was able to reason his way by the deductive method to the existence of the heavens , the stars and the earth , as well as water , air , fire , minerals , etc . When it came farther than that ? to the more detailed operations of nature ? he needed experiment to show him in which of the alternative ways that were possible under his system God actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effects ? amongst a host of possible alternatives that his philosophy would have allowed or explained ? God had actually chosen to produce . Experiment , therefore , only had a subordinate place in the system of Descartes , and in the latter part of the seventeenth century the famous scientist Huygens , who criticised Bacon  | for his lack of mathematics , complained that the theories of Descartes were not sufficiently confirmed by experiment . The beauty and the unity of the system of Descartes lay in the fact that on the one hand it started from God and worked downwards by a system of reasoning that was claimed to be watertight ; while at the same time it worked upwards from below , drawing generalisations or axioms from the experiments . There are signs , however , that Descartes would use an experiment to confirm a hunch or an hypothesis , but would close down the enquiry very soon ? refusing to pursue further observations even when these might have affected the case in a more or less indirect manner . He worried much less about establishing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that , supposing this thing was a fact , his system would provide the explanation ; and , indeed , this system would have explained the case supposing God at one point or another had taken an alternative course that might have been open to Him . So in his treatise on Meteors , which was one of the works attached to his Discourse on Method , he was prepared to explain how the clouds could rain blood , as was sometimes alleged , and how lightning could be turned into a stone . In fact , he confessed that he preferred to apply his method to the explanation of what were the ordinarily accepted phenomena , rather than to use experiment in order to find new phenomena or out-ofthe-way occurrences . Many of his accepted " facts , " like the ones I have just mentioned , were in reality taken over without examination from scholastic writers . He accepted the idea of the circulation of the blood , but quarrelled with Harvey concerning its cause and concerning the action of the heart . He said that when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it effervesced , caused the heart to expand , and leaped of its own motion into the arteries . In this case the truth was that he accepted unconsciously and without real examination the scholastic assumption that the heart functioned as the centre of heat . The men who were influenced by Bacon were chiefly affected by the thesis that experiment was the thing that  | mattered in the natural sciences . And Robert Boyle , who shows clear marks of that influence , was criticised by Huygens and others for having built so little on the great number of experiments that he recorded . The founders of the Royal Society were under that general influence , and in the early proceedings of the Royal Society there is a rage for experiments , not only of what we should call the scientific kind , but in regard to curiosities and prodigies in nature , or in respect of invention and technological devices ? sometimes experiments just to test old wives ' tales . In the synthesis of Descartes , however , as we shall see later , there is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By its mechanisation it anticipated the structure that physical science was to assume in the future . But the combination of the mathematical and the experimental method in England was destined to put the natural science of Descartes into the shade before the seventeenth century had expired .  | THE EFFECT OF THE SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTION ON THE NON-MECHANICAL SCIENCES IT has already been noted that the central studies in the scientific revolution were those of astronomy and mechanics . They represent the fields in which the most drastic changes and the most remarkable progress occurred in the seventeenth century . Picking up one end of the stick , we may consider the suggestion that astronomy might well have been ripe for such development because in so ancient a science observations had been accumulating for thousands of years and the process of revision was bound sooner or later to demand a new effort of synthesis . We may feel at the same time that the science of mechanics had an advantage in that it was a branch of study in which there was much to be achieved by simple devices , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other end of the stick , however , we may say that these sciences were spurred forward because in both cases there was an unusually bad hurdle to get over precisely at the point which the story had then reached . In the one case there was the difficulty of arriving at a proper conception of simple motion . In the other case there was the particular difficulty of conceiving or explaining the motion of the earth itself . With both the sciences it was to transpire that , once the hurdle had been surmounted , the way was left open to an astonishing flood of further change . Perhaps the mere development of mathematics and of the mathematising habit had much to do not only with the scientific revolution in general , but more especially with the surmounting of the significant hurdles that are here in question . It would seem to have been true in any case that the whole history of thought was to be affected by the new study of motion ? whether on the earth or in the sky ? which was the high-water mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one attempt after another to explain many things besides motion , and , indeed , to interpret all the changes of the physical universe , in terms of a purely mechanistic system . The ideal of a clockwork universe was the great contribution of seventeenth-century science to the eighteenth-century age of reason . It is never easy ? if it is possible at all ? to feel that one has reached the bottom of a matter , or touched the last limit of explanation , when dealing with an historical transition . It would appear that the most fundamental changes in outlook , the most remarkable turns in the current of intellectual fashion , may be referable in the last resort to an alteration in men 's feeling for things , an alteration at once so subtle and so generally pervasive that it can not be attributed to any particular writers or any influence of academic thought as such . When at the beginning of the sixteenth century an Englishman could write concerning the clergy that it was scandalous to see half the king 's subjects evading their proper allegiance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know that he was registering a change in the feeling men had for the territorial state , a change more significant in that people were unconscious of the fact that anything novel had been taking place . Subtle changes like this ? the result not of any book but of the new texture of human experience in a new age ? are apparent behind the story of the scientific revolution , a revolution which some have tried to explain by a change in men 's feeling for matter itself . It is fairly clear in the sixteenth century , and it is certain in the seventeenth , that through changes in the habitual use of words , certain things in the natural philosophy of Aristotle had now acquired a coarsened meaning or were actually misunderstood . It may not be easy to say why such a thing should have happened , but men unconsciously betray the fact that a certain Aristotelian thesis simply has no meaning for them any longer ? they just can not think of the stars and heavenly bodies as things without weight even when the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say anything except that it is  | obvious that these heavenly bodies have weight , like any other kind of matter which we meet in our experience . Bacon says , furthermore , that he is unable to imagine the planets as nailed to crystalline spheres ; and the whole idea only seems more absurd to him if the spheres in question are supposed to be made of that liquid , ethereal kind of substance which Aristotle had had in mind . Between the idea of a stone aspiring to reach its natural place at the centre of the universe ? and rushing more fervently as it came nearer home ? and the idea of a stone accelerating its descent under the constant force of gravity , there is an intellectual transition which involves somewhere or other a change in men 's feeling for matter . As we have already seen , there was a change also in the feeling that men had for motion , if only because Aristotle , thinking of simple motion , naturally had in his mind the picture of a horse drawing a cart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary attention on the projectile , which meant a difference in the apprehension of the whole affair . In a similar way , a subtle intellectual change was giving people an interest in the operation of pure mechanism ; and some have even said that this came from the growing familiarity with clocks and machines , though it would be impossible to put one 's finger on any authentic proof of this . The great importance of astronomy and mechanics can certainly not be attributed to this alone , though such a factor may have helped to intensify the preoccupation of scientific enquiry with the question of mechanism . One thing is clear : not only was there in some of the intellectual leaders a great aspiration to demonstrate that the universe ran like a piece of clockwork , but this was itself initially a religious aspiration . It was felt that there would be something defective in Creation itself ? something not quite worthy of God ? unless the whole system of the universe could be shown to be interlocking , so that it carried the pattern of reasonableness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mechanistic universe in the seventeenth century , is significant here ? his mysticism , his music of the spheres , his rational deity , demand a system which has the  | beauty of a piece of mathematics . There had been a time when men had sought to demonstrate God by means of miracles , and the intellect of man had yearned rather to discover the feeling marked a transformation in human experience ; for it is clear that it was now rather the aspiration of the mind to demonstrate divine order and self-consistency . Without regularity in the ordinary workings of the universe the Christian miracles themselves could have no meaning . And , as we have seen , the aspiration to turn the created world into mechanism was part of the reaction against pan-psychic superstition , against the belief that nature itself was magical . It was clear that God could create something out of nothing , but it was obvious to Francis Bacon that nature would do nothing of the kind ? the amount of matter in the universe must remain constant . We have already seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the immutability of God . It is perhaps not too much to say , therefore , that something in the whole intellectual climate of the age helps to explain the attempts which were made in this period to revive those systems which interpreted the nature of matter itself on purely mechanistic principles . It was this which led to the prevalence in the seventeenth century of various forms of what came to be called the corpuscular philosophy . The view became current that all the operations of nature , all the fabric of the created universe , could be reduced to the behaviour of minute particles of matter , and all the variety that presented itself to human experience could be resolved into the question of the size , the configuration , the motion , the position and the juxtaposition of these particles . The ancient atomic theories associated with Democritus and the Epicureans were brought to life again in a new context ; but one broad difference existed ? whereas the ancient theory had tended to attribute everything to the fortuitous combinations of atoms , so that the universe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercy of chance , now there was assumed to be rationality in the mechanism itself ? indeed , the  | corpuscular theories were the result of the search for rationality , and even part of the urge to justify God . Francis Bacon , much as he protested against philosophical systems , took great pains to call attention to the importance of these atomic explanations of the universe . He has some interesting remarks upon this subject in a series of essays entitled Thoughts on the Nature of Things . He pictured the original atoms " throwing themselves into certain groups and knots "  - -  their different combinations being sufficient explanation of the varieties of substance which are presented to the five senses of man . He saw the importance of the motion of the particles and suggested how many things ? heat , for example ? were to be explained by the mere fact of this motion , which took place on a minute scale inside the very fabric of solid substances . In this connection he pointed out that the great defect of the ancient thinkers was their failure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the comprehension of the processes of nature . Some people believed that the minute particles which I have mentioned were the very last thing that could be reached in the analysis and subdivision of matter . They were hard and impenetrable and final ? utterly incapable of further reduction . These people were prepared to desert a principle which had been accepted on the authority of Aristotle ? prepared to admit the existence of a vacuum between the ultimate particles and inside the fabric of matter itself . They tended to follow Gassendi , who in 1626 announced his intention of restoring the philosophy of Epicurus , and produced a system specifically atomic in character . Others , who regarded a vacuum as impossible in any sense and believed therefore in the unbroken continuity of matter throughout the universe , tended rather to follow Descartes . On their view , matter was infinitely divisible , the particles could be broken up and , in fact , there was no really ultimate atom which represented the hard basis of all forms of substance . If all the air could be drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as full as before , and the substance which it now contained would be continuous , however much more ethereal . There were men  | like Robert Boyle who were unwilling to decide between these two views , but still confessed their hankering after some form of what they called the corpuscular philosophy . In the seventeenth century the revelation of the intricate structure of nature ? especially with the increasing use of the magnifying glass , the telescope and then the microscope ? made people greatly interested in the minute subdivision of matter . Bacon himself is an illustration of the way in which men became aware of the extraordinary intricacy in the structure of things and the complexity of even the minute aspects of nature . The new philosophy enabled men to reduce the whole universe to matter and motion . It made possible the explanation of the whole of nature in mechanistic terms . The intention ? often explicitly formulated in the seventeenth century ? of attempting to explain everything in the physical universe by mechanical processes had important effects upon the biological sciences , upon which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would appear to have been stimulated by this new mode of treatment at the first stage of the story ? stimulated to exceptional development on certain sides perhaps . It appears , however , that the time was to come when the mechanistic point of view became an embarrassment in this field , so that it ultimately operated rather as a check upon the progress of knowledge and understanding . We have already seen the mechanical character of William Harvey 's enquiries into the circulation of the blood ; but at Harvey 's university of Padua there is more remarkable direct evidence of the fact that the work and the principles of Galileo were having their effect on the medical faculty . Sanctus Sanctorius ( 1561-1636 ) set out to adapt the thermometer for clinical purposes , and used an instrument invented by Galileo for measuring the beat of the pulse . He studied temperature , respiration , the physics of the circulation , and in particular made experiments in weighing ? he had a balance in which he could both eat and sleep and so could test his own weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | sensible perspiration . Then there was a younger person , Giovanni Alfonso Borelli ( 1608-79 ) , who was a mathematician and a friend of Galileo . His book On the Motion of Animals , published in 168o-81 , just after his death , represented a supreme example of the application of the science of mechanics to the study of the living organism . He was most successful in the treatment of muscular movements , using mathematics and diagrams , so that his treatise looks like a text-book in mechanics . One of his chapters deals with the " Mechanical propositions useful for the more exact determination of the motive power of muscles " . He examined the act of walking as nobody had ever done before , and then turned to the flight of birds and the swimming of fish ? almost the first thing he asks about a bird is where its centre of gravity lies . One of his sections is entitled : " The quantity of air acted upon by the wing of a Bird in flight is in shape a solid sector swept out by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He calculates that " the power of those muscles that beat the wings is greater by ten-thousand times than the weight of the bird " , and he points out that , if anything analogous applies in the case of human beings , the motive power of our pectoral muscles could never be sufficient for such a task , so that the old story of Icarus could not possibly have been true . Starting from the work of William Harvey , he examined the action of the fibres of the heart , and calculated that , to maintain the circulation , the heart at each beat must exert a force equivalent to not less than 135,000 lb . We find him comparing the heart to a piston or a winepress . Also , he worked out that if the blood flows evenly from the arteries , through the minute capillaries , into the veins ( for its return journey to the heart ) , this steady flow is due to the elastic reactions of the arterial walls . The arteries after expansion contract and force the blood forward as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain regularity in the flow is not directly , but indirectly , attributable to the beats of the heart itself . A contemporary of Borelli 's , the Dane , Niels Stensen , who worked chiefly in France and Italy , was also essentially a mechanist , seeking to apply mathematical and  | geometrical principles to the muscles . In proportion as the peculiarly mechanical approach was inadequate , in proportion as chemical operations were involved ? as in the case of the digestion ? this whole method of dealing with the living body was bound to prove a hindrance to biological studies sooner or later . The result of this tendency to glorify mere mechanisation was the spread of the view that the animal body was nothing more than a piece of clockwork . Descartes , completing the continuous interlocking machinery of his physical universe , seems to have made himself the most remarkable exponent of this view . Adherence to his principle of strict animal automatism became , so to speak , a marginal point of dogma and was regarded as a test case amongst the followers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have in you the pure milk of Cartesian orthodoxy . The whole issue was one which aroused great controversy in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries . The philosophy of Descartes made so strict a separation between thought and matter , soul and body , that it was hardly possible to bridge the gulf between them with anything short of a miracle that defeated imagination . Under this system , animals were regarded as being devoid of either thought or genuine consciousness , whereas to possess precisely these two things was the very essence of the human soul . It was even held , therefore , that animals could not authentically see anything or feel the bitterness ? the genuine pangs ? of bodily pain . Their eyes would hold the kind of picture which we have when we are not ourselves ? when we gaze on things with a glassy stare and a vacant look but do not really apprehend . Similarly , in the theory of Descartes , animals had a purely corporeal , unconscious kind of sensation , but no consciousness , no mental agony , no real ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole realm of spiritual things , however , escaped imprisonment in the process of mechanisation , and were superadded presences , flitting vaporously amongst the cog-wheels , the pulleys , the steel castings of a relentless world-machine . It was very difficult to show how  | these two planes of existence could ever have come to intersect , or at what point mind or soul could ever join up with matter . There was a sense in which the soul ? representing chiefly Thought in the Cartesian system ? could hardly be regarded as having a location in space at all . There was another sense in which it was possible to say that it was no more associated with one part of the human body than with another . Descartes particularly attached it , however , to the pineal gland , partly because it was thought that the mere animals did not possess this feature at all . In the next generation , however , Niels Stensen spoiled the argument by discovering this gland in other animals . Descartes , having imagined that he had found the strategic place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by concentrating attention at the next remove upon the action of the nerves . He believed , however , that an actual transmission of matter took place from the nerves to the muscles . In general , he arrived at too direct a process of mechanisation . Leibnitz said that everything which took place in the body of man or animal was as mechanical as the things that happen inside a watch . Some Englishmen later in the seventeenth century ? Henry More , the Cambridge Platonist , for example ? thought that Descartes had gone too far in his idea of man as an organised statue , an automatic machine . Newton felt that , though the system of Descartes necessitated a Creator who had set the clockwork into motion in the first place , it was in danger of making God superfluous once the universe had been given a start . And it is curious to note that , if earlier in the century religious men had hankered after a mathematically interlocking universe to justify the rationality and self-consistency of God , before the end of the century their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanism becoming possibly too self-complete . Boyle differed from Descartes in thinking that God was necessary , not merely to set things in motion and to establish the laws of motion , but also to combine the atoms or corpuscles into those remarkable architectural systems that enabled them to organise themselves  | into a living world . Newton was even prepared to believe that gravity , which was otherwise so apparently unaccountable , represented the constant activity of a living being that pervaded the whole of space . He was ready to think also that special combinations which took place on occasion in the sky ? unusual conjunctures , for example , or the passage of comets along a path when another heavenly body happened to be near ? produced small mechanical derangements and casual discrepancies which necessitated the occasional intervention of a watchful Deity . The effects of the scientific revolution in general , and of the new mechanistic outlook in particular , are vividly illustrated in the works of the Hon. Robert Boyle , who lived from 1627 to 1691 , and who at the same time helps to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bacon . From the age of twenty he came under the influence of the members of a group who from 1645 were meeting in London to study the New Philosophy , specifically described by them as the Experimental Philosophy . At the age of twenty , writing to another member of this group , he confessed that he had once been very much inclined to Copernicus , but he now wrote of the Ptolemaic and Copernican systems , as well as the system of Tycho Brahe , as though they were rival theories in a controversy which at the moment it was impossible to settle . Five or six years after this ? that is to say , in 1652-53 ? he appears to have been converted to the doctrine of the circulation of the blood , and he made the acquaintance of William Harvey at the end of Harvey 's life . In 1654 he went to live in Oxford at the invitation of Dr. John Wilkins , the recently appointed Warden of Wadham College , around whom there were grouped a number of chemists , physicians , etc. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although he talks of having discovered " the usefulness of speculative geometry for natural philosophy " , Boyle regrets his lack of mathematics and his work wears a more Baconian appearance because he does not give that mathematical turn to his researches . In parts of his works he sets out explicitly to justify  | the non-mathematical approach to the problems of science . Boyle sought in the first place to be an historian in Bacon 's sense of the word ? the sense that is implied in the term " natural history " ? namely , to assemble the results of particular enquiries and to accumulate a great collection of data which would be of use in the future to any person wishing to reconstruct natural philosophy . In this sense he set out to produce such collections as a natural history of the air , a history of fluidity and firmness , an experimental history of colour or of cold , just as Bacon had done with winds or with heat . He tells us that one of his collections was designed as a continuation of Sylva Sylvarum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural history . He was so Baconian , he confesses , that for a long time he declined to read Gassendi or Descartes or even Bacon 's own Novum Organum , lest he should be seduced too early by lofty hypotheses ; though he agrees that there is a place for hypotheses behind experiments , and only insists that these should be of a subordinate kind , and that the scientist shall not cling to them too long or build too great superstructures upon them . Occasionally he says he will communicate the results of experiments without any theories concerning their causes , because it is the concrete data established by his enquiries which will be of permanent use , whether his theories prove to be acceptable or not . He created a certain public interest in his experiments as he employed a host of " assistants , experimenters , secretaries and collectors " . It was noted by the contemporary scientist , Huygens , and has been repeated with some justice by historians of science since , that in relation to the vast amount of experimental work that he put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategic changes in science . He wrote like Bacon : " It has long seemed to me to be none of the least impediments of the real advancement of true natural philosophy that men have been so forward to write systems of it . " He complained that even the new science , the mechanical philosophy , still had too narrow an experimental basis , and that people despised the limited generalisations of the Baconian experimentalist ? the  | world wanted everything to be explained from first principles after the manner of Descartes , and thought it nothing if you merely proved that a certain phenomenon was the result of the application of heat . He valued Bacon even where Bacon has most been despised by modem writers ? namely , in his natural history . And though Boyle had severe things to say about Bacon 's contemporary ? the famous chemist , Van Helmont ? as well as about many other people , he found it hard to believe that the great Francis Bacon could have been foolish . In one or two cases where people jeered at Bacon for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enquire how Bacon could have been wrong , and discovered that , for example , Bacon was correct if you assume that he used a purer sort of spirits of wine than was usually employed a generation later . Even apart from this , he was interested in those anomalies or impurities which often existed in the materials employed by chemists , and which explain why so many of their experiments were vitiated . He wrote about the whole range of accidents which in given cases prevented experiments from producing the correct result or even a uniform result . He kept careful registers of observations himself and insisted on the importance of recording experiments , of confirming them by unwearied repetition , and of distrusting a great amount of what purported to be the published record of experiments . He was Baconian in that he repeatedly thanked God that he had been initiated into chemical operations by illiterate artisans ? men not capable of infusing into his mind the notions and philosophising of the alchemists , a class of people who had been blinded by the jargon of their trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is more popularly known as alchemy , his belief that he could turn water into earth , his idea that he had transmuted gold into a lower metal , and the degree of secrecy and mystification which he manifested in regard to some of his work . It was because of his confidence in his work on that side that he petitioned parliament in 1689 and secured the repeal of a law of Henry IV 's reign against people who set out to multiply gold and silver .  | It is difficult for us to imagine the state of chemical enquiry before the days of Boyle , or to comprehend on the one hand the mystifications and the mysticisms , on the other hand the anarchical condition of things , amongst the alchemists in general . Van Helmont , who stands roughly twenty years after Francis Bacon , made one or two significant chemical discoveries , but these are buried in so much fancifulness ? including the view that all bodies can ultimately be resolved into water ? that even twentieth-century commentators on Van Helmont are fabulous creatures themselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in comparison . Concerning alchemy it is more difficult to discover the actual state of things , in that the historians who specialise in this field seem sometimes to be under the wrath of God themselves ; for , like those who write on the Bacon-Shakespeare controversy or on Spanish politics , they seem to become tinctured with the kind of lunacy they set out to describe . Two things , however , are clear in the time of Boyle , because the conscious campaign against them was one of the explicit objects of much of his writing . On the one hand he quarrelled with the scholastic interpretation of the properties and qualities ? greenness , fluidity , coldness , etc. ? which bodies possess ; that is to say , he quarrelled with a traditional doctrine of what were called " substantial forms " , a doctrine which he claimed had become hardened and perverted since its exposition by Aristotle . In this connection he showed that the doctrine of " substantial forms " had explained nothing and had only added a species of mystification , while it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important problems had been solved in recent times in statics , hydrostatics , etc . On the other hand , in regard to the constitution of matter , the followers of Aristotle believed that substances could be resolved into the four elements ? earth , water , air and fire . The alchemists , whom Boyle was in the habit of calling Spagyrists , believed that matter could be resolved into three hypostatical principles ? sulphur , salt and mercury . In his attack upon these views or upon any combination of them , Boyle came near to laying  | the foundations of modern chemistry and made his significant contributions to science ? contributions relating to the structure of matter . Here his work is so stimulating that some historical explanation has to be provided for the fact that it took another century to place the science of chemistry really on its feet . At a point where his work was to be of such interest and importance in the history of science , it is curious to note that Robert Boyle , in spite of all his preaching against that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which he apparently tried to fight against himself , was spurred and stimulated by a species of doctrine , an all-embracing philosophy which had become current amongst the more advanced thinkers of the time . In a sense he was Baconian even in this ? for it was the corpuscular view of the universe which had attracted him , and Bacon in one of his most fascinating essays , as we have seen , had called attention to the corpuscular theory , making the significant remark that it was either true or useful for the purposes of demonstration , since hardly any other hypothesis enabled one either to comprehend or to portray the extraordinary subtlety of nature . Far from regarding it as a purely speculative theory of the kind that ought to be avoided , Bacon had told the scientists that this was precisely the direction in which they ought to move if they wished to " cut nature to the quick " . Boyle tells us that for a long time he avoided reading about the corpuscularian hypothesis lest his work and his mind should be deflected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could not really resist it . He continually discussed it whether in the form of an atomic theory in Gassendi , or in the system of Descartes , which regarded matter as infinitely divisible , and he bracketed the two as forms of the corpuscularian theory , setting them against both the Aristotelian and the alchemical theories of matter . He said on one occasion that he was prepared to be corrected in his particular generalisations about the formations of mixtures and compounds in chemistry , but that as a natural philosopher he did not expect to " see any principles proposed more comprehensive and intelligible than the corpuscularian " ,  | which he often also called the " mechanical " philosopy , since it purported to give a mechanical explanation of the physical universe . Here , then , is another way in which Boyle is a product of the scientific revolution on its essentially mechanical side . Boyle said that the Peripatetics , the Aristotelians , made too little use of experiment ? they brought in experiment merely to illustrate the principles they had arrived at in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baconian in character , and perhaps not quite just , and the same was true of the continued attacks upon the syllogistic method . Boyle was Baconian again when he pointed out that the mechanical philosophers themselves " have brought few experiments to verify their assertions " . He consciously set out to do that particular service to the mechanical philosophers ? to supply the experimental background for their theory of matter ; and in that sense , in spite of the multitude of his protestations , he was laying himself open to the charge of doing the very thing he had reproached the Aristotelians for doing ? namely , using experiments to demonstrate and fortify a philosophy already existing in his mind . Above all , Boyle tells us that he set out to " beget a good understanding between the chymists and the mechanical philosophers who have hitherto been too little acquainted with one another 's learning " . He stressed the necessity for an alliance between chemistry and mechanical science in the study of the body ? stressed the importance of having men actually skilled in both sciences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play , for example in research on the subject of the digestion . He regarded the whole corpuscular philosophy as being confirmed by chemical science , in the operations of which , he said , it often happened that " matter was divided into parts too small to be singly sensible " . On the one hand , therefore , the principles of mechanics are often brought by Boyle into connection with chemical and medical questions ? he has a work , for example , entitled Medicina Hydrostatica or Hydrostatics applied to Materia Medica . On the other hand , he constantly hauls these sciences  | into connection with the fashionable seventeenth-century hypotheses concerning the structure of matter . One of his writings is entitled Of the Reconcileableness of Specific Medicines to the Corpuscular Philosophy . He repeatedly expressed his anxiety to show that chemical experiments had relevance and applicability to natural philosophy in its higher reaches . In all this it is abundantly clear that he thought he was doing the greatest possible service to Christianity , for the interests of which he was very jealous and for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacks both on Aristotle and on the alchemists , he gives a close picture of the structure of matter as conceived in the new mechanical philosophy , and we can follow the way in which he was led to his new doctrine concerning the chemical elements . On his view , the universe could be explained from three original principles ? matter , motion and rest ? matter itself being capable of reduction to minute particles which on one occasion and for purposes of illustration he was prepared to assume to be a billionth of an inch in length . Firstly , he said : there are in the world great stores of particles of matter , each of which is too small to be , whilst single , sensible ; and being intire or undivided must needs have both its determinate shape and be very solid . Insomuch that though it might be mentally and by divine omnipotence divisible , yet by reason of its smallness and solidity nature doth scarce ever actually divide it ; and these may in a sense be called minima or prima naturalia . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multitudes of corpuscles which are made up of the coalition of several of the former particles or minima naturalia ; and whose bulk is so small and their adhesion so close and strict that each of these little primitive concretions or clusters . . . of particles is singly below the discernment of sense ; and though not absolutely in-  | divisible by nature into the original particles or prima naturalia that composed it . . . they very rarely happen to be actually dissolved or broken but remain intire in a great variety of sensible bodies . Granted the original particles and their clustering together in knots or concretions , says Boyle , the purely mechanical movements and arrangements of these minute corpuscles will explain all the different characteristics and tendencies of physical bodies , so that there is no need to resort to Aristotelian notions of forms or to any mystification about the quality of greenness in bodies that happen to look green . The differences between one substance and another are merely differences in the schematic systems into which the particles of common matter are ranged , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of texture or structure which the various possible combinations produce . The configuration of the corpuscles , the size of the clusters , the position or posture of the particles ? these are sufficient to explain all the variety that exists in nature . One of Boyle 's works is entitled Experiments about the Mechanical Origin or Production of Particular Qualities , and it includes a discourse on the mechanical origin of heat and of magnetism . Boyle showed elsewhere that bodies are fluid when the minute corpuscles lie over one another , touching at only some parts of their surfaces , so that they easily glide along each other until they meet some resisting body " to whose internal surface they exquisitely accommodate themselves " . " Bodies exhibit colours not upon the account of the predominancy of this or that principle in them but upon that of their texture and especially the disposition of their superficial parts ; whereby the light rebounding thence to the eye is modified . " Whiteness is the result of reflection from a body whose surface is asperated by almost innumerable small surfaces ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirrors are also so placed that some looking this way and  | some that , they yet reflect the rays of light that fall on them not towards one another but outwards towards the spectator 's eye . And just as the colours of plush or velvet will vary as you stroke one part of the fabric one way and another part another way just as the wind creates waves of colour and shadow in a field of corn as it falls differently in different parts of it ? so the posture and inclination of the particles in a given body will govern the way the light is modified before it is returned to the eye . Something similar to this is true with various processes in nature or in chemistry ? in the case of putrefaction , for example , air or some other fluid fetches out the looser particles , and the substance is dislocated , producing perhaps even a change in the composition of the separate corpuscles . The taste of things is accounted for in a parallel way : If bodies be reduced into a multitude of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some of these , : . either in part or in conjunction with others , may acquire a size and shape that fits them sensibly to affect the organ of taste . He speaks sometimes as though it were a case of their sharp edges pricking . His total view is clear ? the qualities and properties of the bodies that we know may be accounted for by motion , size , configuration and combinations of particles . The behaviour of the particles and the resulting manifestations in the various kinds of body that exist are attributed by him to what he calls " the mechanical affections of matter " , because , he says , they are analogous to " the various operations of mechanical engines " . He often talks of the human body as a " matchless engine " and of the universe as " an automaton or self-moving engine " . He was greatly concerned over what he was for ever calling the texture or the structure of matter , the result of the numberless combinations that were possible with particles and corpuscles . Many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this question ; and it is not surprising that his most important contribution to chemistry lay in this field ? namely , in his discussion of what constituted a chemical element . His most famous work , The Sceptical Chymist , addresses itself to this particular question . It does not give his positive system at its ripest ? we must rather regard it as his greatest piece of destructive work . He attacked what his predecessors had hitherto regarded as the virtually irreducible things in chemistry ? on the one hand , Aristotle 's doctrine of the four elements ; on the other hand , the teaching of the alchemist on the subject of the three hypostatical principles . He showed that the alchemists were wrong in assuming that by the use of fire all mixed bodies could be analysed into their elementary ingredients . He demonstrated that , indeed , different things happened if a sample of some mixed body were burned in an open fire and another sample in a closed retort . The results produced on a substance by a moderate degree of heat , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced by a very great heat . He showed that sometimes fire actually united bodies of different natures or produced out of a substance new compounds that had not existed previously . Having combined two ingredients to form soap , he heated the soap in a closed retort and produced out of it two substances different from the ones he had used originally . He maintained that fire divides mixed bodies because some parts are more fixed and others more volatile , but that it does not matter whether either of these is of an elementary nature or not ? fire does not necessarily reduce a substance into its primary elements . At the same time he pointed out that nobody had ever divided gold into any four component parts , while blood was a substance capable of being reduced to more than four ingredients . He drew attention to the difference between chemical compounds and mere mixtures , showed how the two were differently related to the elements composing them , and indicated the tests that would facilitate the identification of individual substances . In a full-dress attack on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? sulphur , salt and mercury ? he clarified the description of the irreducible nature of a chemical element , though Van Helmont had foreshadowed him in this , and indeed it can be argued that , through the way in which he apprehended the matter , Boyle introduced a new confusion which nullified the benefit he had bestowed . He showed that fire was unable to reduce glass to its elements , though everybody was aware that there were elements to which it could be reduced , since it was composed of sand and alkali . He regarded a piece of gold as being built up from very fine corpuscles and he was prepared to believe that these metallic corpuscles were even more resistant to sub-division than glass itself . He regarded them as composed of ultimate particles , each corpuscle being what he called a " concretion " ? extremely stable , extremely difficult to reduce , and clearly recoverable even after gold had been compounded with something else and had apparently disappeared . But he was not convinced that they could never be resolved into something more genuinely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistently prepared to be pragmatic , as Lavoisier was ready to be at a later date , and to accept a substance as " elementary " merely because it had proved chemically irreducible up to this time . On occasion he even expressed doubts about the existence of " chemical elements " or the need for postulating such things , since the differences between one substance and another might be explained as the effect of size , shape , structure , texture , and motion produced by the mere accretion and architectural arrangement of the ultimate particles of primary matter . Chemistry itself could be reduced to what has been called " micro-mechanics " , therefore ; and Boyle himself showed a tendency to rush direct to this ultimate explanation of the qualities that he found in any kind of matter . In this , if to some degree he foreshadowed a distant future , he may still have done harm , because it meant by-passing the whole idea of a chemical element . His mechanistic philosophy may have helped him in some ways , but it hindered him in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the argu-  | ment his work , in proportion as it influenced the world , may well have served rather to check the progress of chemistry . The Paracelsan division of matter into three hypostatical " principles " may have gone somewhat out of fashion in the subsequent period ; but the parallel system of Aristotle ? the doctrine of the four " elements " ? was to recover favour , as was noted in the eighteenth century . Boyle 's study of the atmosphere , which inaugurated his career as a chemist and his quarrel with Aristotelianism , has an important place in a longer narrative of seventeenth-century discovery . When Galileo was faced with two smooth slabs of marble or metal so clinging together that the one could lift the other , he interpreted the phenomenon in accordance with the Aristotelian thesis that nature abhors a vacuum , and he slurred over the objection that the resistance of these bodies to any attempt to separate them could hardly be due to something which did not yet exist ? namely , the vacuum that would be produced by their separation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet Galileo did not ask why nature 's abhorrence of a vacuum should come to its limit at that point ? he said that the column of water broke by its own weight , just as he said one might hang up a column of iron so long and heavy that it would break by its own weight . Galileo both regarded the atmosphere as having weight and conjectured that a column of mercury , because it was so much heavier than water , would break if it reached only onefourteenth of the height that a pump could carry water . But it was his disciple , Torricelli , who took a tube three feet long ( sealed at the top ) , filled it with mercury , and immersed it in a bowl of mercury , so that the column of liquid fell to two feet six inches ; thereby showing that the pressure of the atmosphere kept up the column of mercury and that something like a vacuum existed at the top of the tube . This led to the discovery of the barometer and then to further experiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example ? while in Germany the observation of the pumping of water led to the important discovery of the air-pump.  | Robert Boyle greatly improved the German air-pump which , he tells us , required the hard labour of two men for many hours before the vessel could be emptied . He demonstrated that the air could be weighed ? that it had an expansive force which resisted pressure and that the barometric column was kept up solely by the weight of the outside air . At one moment he made the interesting conjecture that the behaviour of the air might be explained by regarding its minute particles as so many tiny coiled-up springs . In addition to all this , he studied both respiration and combustion and came near to the discovery of oxygen when he said : " There is in the air a little vital quintessence ( if I may call it so ) which serves to the refreshment and restoration of our vital spirits , for which uses the grosser and incomparably greater part of the air is unserviceable . " He realised that in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is scarce a more heterogeneous body in the world . " But it seems to have been his view that the air itself was homogeneous , the variations being due to the presence of steams and effluvia which in reality were foreign to it . In this single field his experiments did much to justify the Baconian influence under which they were undertaken ? the principle that the scientist should use the experimental method in order to collect concrete data , without attempts at too hurried synthesis . And if his concentration on the mechanical activity of the air may have had unfortunate effects on the chemical study of the atmosphere in the following period , as we shall see , Boyle in general marks so great a difference from the older chemistry that historians have had to wonder why greater progress was not made in that science in the next century .  | THE HISTORY OF THE MODERN THEORY OF GRAVITATION IT became clear to us when we were studying the work of Copernicus that the hypothesis of the daily and annual rotation of the earth presented two enormous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in dynamics . It was the question : What power was at work to keep this heavy and sluggish earth ( as well as the rest of the heavenly bodies ) in motion The second was more complicated and requires some explanation ; it was the problem of gravity . On the older theory of the cosmos all heavy bodies tended to fall to the centre of the earth , because this was the centre of the universe . It did not matter if such earthy and heavy material were located for a moment on the immaculate surface of a distant star ? it would still be drawn , or rather would aspire to rush , to the same universal centre , the very middle of this earth . Indeed , supposing God had created other universes besides ours and a genuine piece of earthy material found itself in one of these , it would still tend to fall to the centre of our universe , because every urge within it would make it seek to come back to its true home . Granted an earth which described a spacious orbit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer be regarded as the centre of the universe . In that case , how could the existence of gravity be explained ? For it was still true that heavy objects seemed to aspire to reach the centre of the earth . The two problems in question became more acute when , towards the end of the sixteenth century , men began to see the untenability of the view that the planets were kept in motion and held in their proper courses by their attachment to the great crystalline orbs that formed the series of rotating skies . It became necessary to find another reason why these heavenly bodies should keep in movement yet not drift at the mercy of  | chance in the ocean of boundless space . These two problems were the most critical issues of the seventeenth century , and were only solved in the grand synthesis produced by Sir Isaac Newton in his Principia in 1687 ? a synthesis which represented the culmination of the scientific revolution and established the basis of modern science . Though it entails a certain amount of recapitulation , we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we try to mark out the chief stages in the development of this new system of the universe . It has been suggested that Copernicus owes to Nicholas of Cusa his view that a sphere set in empty space would begin to turn without needing anything to move it . Francis Bacon said that before the problem of the heavens could be solved it would be necessary to study the question of what he called " spontaneous rotation " . Galileo , who seems at times almost to have imagined gravity as an absolute ? as a kind of " pull " which existed in the universe irrespective of any particular object in space ? drew a fancy-picture of God dropping the planets vertically until they had accelerated themselves to the required speed , and then stopping the fall , turning it into circular motion at the achieved velocity ? a motion which on his principle of inertia could then be presumed to continue indefinitely . Involved in the whole discussion concerning the form of the universe was the special problem of circular motion . Copernicus was responsible for raising these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not fail to realise the magnitude of the problems he had set . It was his view that other bodies besides the earth ? the sun and the moon , for example ? possessed the virtue of gravity ; but he did not mean that the earth , the sun and the moon were united in a universal gravitational system or balanced against one another in a mutual harmony . He meant that any mundane object would aspire to regain contact with the earth , even if it had been carried to the surface of the moon . The sun , the moon and the earth , in fact , had their private systems , their exclusive brands , their appropriate types of gravity . For Copernicus , furthermore , gravity still remained a tendency or an aspiration in the alien-  | ated body , which rushed , so to speak , to join its mother ? it was not a case of the earth exercising an actual " pull " on the estranged body . And , as we have already seen , Copernicus regarded gravity as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sphere . The Aristotelian theory had implied the converse of this ? the earth became spherical because of the tendency of matter to congregate as near as possible around its centre . In view of the principles which were emphasised in this way in the system of Copernicus , a special significance attaches to the famous book which William Gilbert published in 1600 on the subject of the magnet . This work marks , in fact , a new and important stage in the history of the whole problem which we are discussing . I have already mentioned how , according to Aristotle , four elements underlay all the forms of sublunary matter , and one of these was called " earth " ? not the soil which we can take into our hands , but a more refined and sublimated substance free from the mixtures and impurities that characterise the common earth . William Gilbert , starting from this view , held that the matter on or near the surface of the globe was waste and sediment ? a purely external wrapping like the skin and hair of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the influence of the heavenly bodies it was peculiarly subject to debasement and to the operation of chance and change . The authentic " earth " ? Aristotle 's element in its pure state ? was to be found below this superficial level , and formed , in fact , the bulk of the interior of this globe . Indeed , it was neither more nor less than lodestone . This world of ours was for the most part simply a colossal magnet . The force of the magnetic attraction was the real cause of gravity , said Gilbert , and it explained why the various parts of the earth could be held together . The force of the attraction exerted was always proportional to the quantity or mass of the body exerting it ? the greater the mass of the lodestone , the greater the " pull " which it exercises on the related object . At the same time , this attraction was not regarded as representing a force which could operate at a distance or across a vacuum ?  | it was produced by a subtle exhalation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reciprocal one ; the earth and the moon both attracted and repelled one another , the earth having the greater effect because it was so greatly superior in mass . If a magnet were cut in two , the surfaces where the break had been made represented opposite poles and had a hankering to join up with one another again . Magnetism seemed to represent the tendency of parts to keep together in a whole , therefore ? the tendency of bodies , of material units , to maintain their integrity . Gilbert 's view of gravity carried with it an attack on the idea that any mere geometrical point ? the actual centre of the universe , for example ? could operate as the real attraction or could stand as the goal towards which an object moved . Aristotle had said that heavy bodies were attracted to the centre of the universe . The later scholastics who adopted the impetus-theory ? Albert of Saxony , for example ? had developed this view and had brought out the point that in reality it was the centre of gravity of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gilbert , on the other hand , insisted that gravity was not an action taking place between mere mathematical points , but was a characteristic of the stuff itself , a feature of the actual particles which were affected by the relationship . What was important was the tendency on the part of matter to join matter . It was the real material of the magnet that was engaged in the process , as it exercised its influence on a kindred object . Francis Bacon was attracted by this view of gravity , and it occurred to him that , if it was true , then a body taken down a well or a mine ? into the bowels of the earth ? would perhaps weigh less than at the surface of the earth , since some of the attraction exerted from below would possibly be cancelled by magnetic counter-attraction from that part of the earth which was now above . And though there were fallacies in this hypothesis , the experiment was apparently attempted more than once in the latter half of the seventeenth century ; Robert Hooke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's suggestion , though he failed to reach a satisfactory result .  | Gilbert 's views on the subject of gravity took their place amongst the prevailing ideas of the seventeenth century , though they did not remain unchallenged , and it was long confessed that the question presented a mystery . Robert Boyle wrote of gravity as being possibly due to what he called " magnetical steams " of the earth . He was prepared , however , to consider an alternative hypothesis ? namely , that it was due to the pressure of matter ? the air itself and the ethereal substances above the air ? upon any body that happened to be underneath . William Gilbert constructed a spherical magnet called a terrella , and its behaviour strengthened his belief that the magnet possesses the very properties of the globe on which we live ? namely , attraction , polarity , the tendency to revolve , and the habit of " taking positions in the universe according to the law of the whole " ? automatically finding its proper place in relation to the rest of the cosmos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is impelled by its own force and " by a consentient compact of other bodies " ; there was a correspondence between the movement of one body and another so that they formed a kind of choir ; he described the planets as each observing the career of the rest and all chiming in with one another 's movements . That gravitational pull towards the centre affected not merely bodies on the earth , he said , but operated similarly with the sun , the moon , etc. , and these also moved in circles for magnetic reasons . Magnetism , furthermore , was responsible for the rotation of the earth and the other heavenly bodies on their axes . And it was not difficult to achieve rotation even in the case of the earth , he said , because as the earth has a natural axis it is balanced in equilibrium ? its parts have weight but the earth itself has no weight ? it " is set in motion easily by the slightest cause " . He held that the moon always turned the same face to the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like Copernicus , he regarded the sun as the most powerful of all the heavenly bodies . The sun , he said , was the chief inciter of action in nature . In a curious manner the wider theories of Gilbert had found  | the way prepared for them and had had their prospects somewhat facilitated . Since the fourteenth century there had existed a theory that some magnetic attraction exerted by the moon was responsible for the tides . Such an idea came to be unpopular amongst the followers of Copernicus , but it appealed to astrologers because it supported the view that the heavenly bodies could exercise an influence upon the earth . In the very year after the publication of Copernicus 's great treatise ? that is to say , in 1544 ? a work was produced which attributed the tides to the movement of the earth , and Galileo , as we have already seen , was to make this point one of his capital arguments in favour of the Copernican revolution . It was in reply to Galileo that the astrologer Morin put forward a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ namely , that not only the moon but also the sun contributed to affect the tides . Galileo at one time was prepared to adopt the more general theories of Gilbert in a vague kind of way , though he did not pretend that he had understood magnetism or the mode of its operation in the universe . He regretted that Gilbert had been so much a mere experimenter and had failed to mathematise magnetic phenomena in what we have seen to be the Galileian manner . Even earlier than Galileo , however , the great astronomer Kepler had been influenced by Gilbert 's book , and it appears that he had been interested somewhat in magnetism before the work of Gilbert had been published . Kepler must have an important place in the story because , under the influence of the magnetic theory , he turned the whole problem of gravity into a problem of what we call attraction . It was no longer a case of a body aspiring to reach the earth , but , rather , it was the earth which was to be regarded as drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near to this one , said Kepler , and this earth of ours would acquire weight in relation to the bigger one and tend to fall into it , as a stone falls on to the ground . And , as in Gilbert 's case , it was not now a mathematical point , not the centre of the earth , that exercised the attraction , but matter itself and every particle of matter . If the earth were a  | sphere , the stone would tend to move towards its centre for that reason , but if the earth were differently shaped ? if one of its surfaces were an irregular quadrilateral , for example ? the stone would move towards different points according as it approached the earth from one side or another . Kepler further showed that the attraction between bodies was mutual ? the stone attracts the earth as well as the earth a stone ? and if there were nothing to interfere with the direct operation of gravity , then the earth and the moon would approach one another and meet at an intermediate point ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be of the same density as the moon ) because it was fifty-four times as big as the moon . It was their motion in their orbits which prevented the earth and its satellite from coming into collision with one another in this way . In Kepler we see that curious rapprochement between gravity and magnetism which was already visible in Gilbert , whom he admired so greatly , and which is explicit in later seventeenth-century writers . As in the example of the broken magnet this gravity could be described as a tendency in cognate bodies to unite . Kepler belongs also to the line of writers who believed that the tides were caused by the magnetic action of the moon ; and he has been criticised on the ground that his chains of magnetic attraction , which he pictured as streaming out of the earth , were so strong as to have made it impossible to hurl a projectile across them . He did not quite reach the idea of universal gravitation , however ? for example , he did not regard the fixed stars as being terrestrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that Jupiter threw shadows and Venus had no light on the side away from the sun . Like Bacon , he seems to have regarded the skies as becoming more xthereal ? more unlike the earth ? as they receded from our globe and as one approached the region of the fixed stars . Also , he regarded the sun as a special case , with , so to speak , a gravity of its own . Having noted that the speed of planets decreased as the planet became more distant from the sun , he regarded this as  | a confirmation of the view to which he was mystically attached in any case ? namely , that the sun was responsible for all the motion in the heavens , though it acted by a kind of power which diminished as it operated at a farther range . He held that the planets were moved on their course by a sort of virtue which streamed out of the sun ? a force which moved round as the sun itself rotated and which operated , so to speak , tangentially on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luvium magneticum and seemed to regard it as something which was transmitted along with the rays of light . If the sun did not rotate , he said , the earth could not revolve around it , and if the earth did not rotate on its axis , the moon in turn would not revolve around our globe . The rotation of the earth on its axis was largely caused by a force inherent in the earth , said Kepler , but the sun did something also to assist this movement . Granting that the earth rotates 365 times in the course of the year , he thought that the sun was responsible for five of these . Kepler knew nothing of the modern doctrine of inertia which assumes that bodies will keep in motion until something intervenes to stop them or to deflect their course . In his theory the planets required a positive force to push them around the sky and to keep them in motion . He had to explain why the motion was elliptical instead of circular and for this purpose he made further use of magnetism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth , always remained in one direction , and at a given angle , so that now the sun drew these bodies in , now it pushed them away , producing therefore an elliptical orbit . The force with which the planets were propelled , however , did not radiate in all directions and distribute itself indiscriminately throughout the universe like light , but moved from the sun only along the plane of the planet 's orbit . The force had to know , so to speak , where to find its object , therefore ? not ranging over the whole void but aiming its shafts within the limits of a given field . In a similar way , the idea that the attracting body must be sensible of its object ? the earth must know where the moon was located in order to  | direct its " pull " to that region ? was one of the obstacles to the theory of an attraction exerted by bodies on one another across empty space . The world , then , seemed to be making a remarkable approach to the modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and many of the ingredients of the modern doctrine were already there . At this point in the story , however , an important diversion occurs , and it was to have an extremely distracting effect even long after the time of Sir Isaac Newton himself . Rene Descartes ? who , as we have seen , had undertaken , so to speak , to reconstruct the universe , starting with only matter and motion , and working deductively ? produced a world-system which it is easy for us to underestimate today , unless we remember the influence that it had even on great scientists for the rest of the century and still later . It is only in retrospect and perhaps through optical illusions that ? as in the case of more ancient attempts to create worldsystems ? we may be tempted to feel at this point that the human mind , seeking too wide a synthesis and grasping it too quickly , may work to brilliant effect , yet only in order to produce future obstructions for itself . We have already seen that , in spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past , Descartes was liable to be misled by too easy an acceptance of data that had been handed down by scholastic writers . It is curious to note similarly that two grand Aristotelian principles helped to condition the form of the universe as he reconstructed it ? first , the view that a vacuum is impossible , and secondly , the view that objects could only influence one another if they actually touched ? there could be no such thing as attraction , no such thing as action at a distance . As a result of this , Descartes insisted that every fraction of space should be fully occupied all the time by continuous matter ? matter which was regarded as infinitely divisible . The particles were supposed to be packed so tightly that one of them could not move without communicating the commotion to the rest . This matter formed whirlpools in the skies , and it was because the  | planets were caught each in its own whirlpool that they were carried round like pieces of straw ? driven by the matter with which they were in actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their proper places in the sky . It was because they were all similarly caught in a larger whirlpool , which had the sun as its centre , that they ( and their particular whirlpools ) were carried along , across the sky , so that they described their large orbits around the sun . Gravity itself was the result of these whirlpools of invisible matter which had the effect of sucking things down towards their own centre . The mathematical principles governing the whirlpool were too difficult to allow any great precision at this time in such a picture of the machinery of the universe . The followers of Descartes laid themselves open to the charge that they reconstructed the system of things too largely by deduction and insisted on phenomena which they regarded as logically necessary but for which they could bring no actual evidence . In the time of Newton the system of Descartes and the theory of vortices or whirlpools proved to be vulnerable to both mathematical and experimental attack . At the same time certain believers in the plenum ? in the Cartesian idea of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was to become the Newtonian synthesis . Descartes himself achieved the modern formulation of the law of inertia ? the view that motion continues in a straight line until interrupted by something ? working it out by a natural deduction from his theory of the conservation of momentum , his theory that the amount of motion in the universe always remains the same . It was he rather than Galileo who fully grasped this principle of inertia and formulated it in all its clarity . A contemporary of his , Roberval , first enunciated the theory of universal gravitation ? applying it to matter everywhere ? though he did not discover any law regarding the variation in the strength of this gravitational force as it operated at various distances . He saw a tendency throughout the whole of matter to cohere and come together ; and on his view the moon would have fallen into the earth if it had not been for the thickness of the ether within the intervening space  | ? the fact that the matter existing between the earth and the moon put up a resistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1643 . It was in 1665 that the next important step was taken , when Alphonse Borelli , though he followed Kepler in the view that it needed a force emanating from the sun to push the planets around in their orbits , said that the planets would fall into the sun by a " natural instinct " to approach the central body if the effect of gravity were not counterbalanced by a centrifugal tendency ? the tendency of the planets to leave the curve of their orbits , like a stone seeking to leave the sling . So , though he came short in that he failed to see the planets moving by their own inertial motion and failed to understand the nature of that gravity which drew the planets towards the sun , Borelli did present the picture of the planets balanced between two opposing forces ? one which tended to make them fall into the sun , and another which tended to make them fly off at a tangent . In the ancient world ? in a work of Plutarch 's which was familiar to Kepler , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a sling , in the sense that its circular motion overcame the effect of gravity . Borelli was unable to carry his whole hypothesis beyond the stage of vague conjecture , however , because he failed to understand the mathematics of centrifugal force . By this date ( 1665 ) , most of the ingredients of Newton 's gravitational theory were in existence , though scattered in the writings of different scientists in such a way that no man held them in combination . The modern doctrine of inertia had been put forward by Descartes and was quickly gaining acceptance , though people like Borelli , who has just been mentioned , still seemed to think that they had to provide a force actually pushing the planets along their orbit . The view that gravity was universal , operating between all bodies , had also been put forward , and on this view it became comprehensible that the sun should have a pull on the planets , and the earth should keep the moon from flying off into space . Now , in 1665 , there was the suggestion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force ? a tendency of the planets to go off ' at a tangent and slip out of the sling that held them . All these ideas ? inertia , gravitation and centrifugal force ? are matters of terrestrial mechanics ; they represented precisely those points of dynamics which had to be grappled with and understood before the movements of the planets and the whole problem of the skies were settled . But if you had these on the one hand , there were the findings of astronomers on the other hand , which had to be incorporated in the final synthesis ? and these included Kepler 's three laws of planetary motion ; the one which described the orbits as elliptical ; the one which said that a line between the sun and any planet covered equal areas in equal times ; and the one which said that the square of the time of the orbit was proportional to the cube of the mean distance from the sun . It had to be shown mathematically that the planets would behave in the way Kepler said they behaved , supposing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned . Huygens worked out the necessary mathematics of centrifugal action , especially the calculation of the force that was required to hold the stone in the sling and prevent it rushing off at a tangent . He seems to have arrived at this formula in 1659 , but he only published his results in this field in 1673 , as an appendix to his work on the pendulum clock . It seems , however , that it never occurred to Huygens to apply his views of circular motion and centrifugal force to the planets themselves ? that is to say , to the problem of the skies ; and he seems to have been hampered at this point of the argument by the influence of the ideas of Descartes on the subject of the heavenly bodies . In 1669 he tried to explain gravity as the sucking effect of those whirlpools of matter with which Descartes had filled the whole of space , and he illustrated this by rotating a bowl of water and showing how heavy particles in the water moved towards the centre as the rotation slowed down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was natural and fundamental ? not a thing requiring to be specially explained ? and that rectilinear motion in the case of falling  | bodies , as with the particles in the rotating bowl of water , was , so to speak , a by-product of circular motion . A writer on Keats has attempted to show how in the period before the production of the sonnet " On Reading Chapman 's Homer " the poet had been setting his mind at play ? and gradually making himself at home ? in what might be described as the field of its effective imagery . Now there had been an experiment in terms of astronomical discovery , now an attempt to squeeze a poetical phrase from the experience of the explorer ; but one after another had misfired . The mind of the poet , however , had traversed and re-traversed the field , and in the long run apparently a certain high pressure had been generated , so that when the exalted moment came ? that is to say , when Chapman 's Homer had provided the stimulus ? the happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind of the poet . The sonnet came from the pen without effort , without any apparent preparation , but , in fact , a subterranean labour had long been taking place . So , as the seventeenth century proceeded , the minds of men had traversed and re-traversed the fields which we have been studying , putting things together this way and that , but never quite succeeding , though a certain high pressure was clearly being generated . One man might have grasped a strategic piece in the puzzle and , in a realm which at the time hardly seemed relevant , another scientist would have seized upon another piece , but neither had quite realised that if the two were put together they would be complementary . Already the scattered parts of the problem were beginning to converge , however , and the situation had become so ripe that one youth who made a comprehensive survey of the field and possessed great elasticity of mind , could shake the pieces into the proper pattern with the help of a few intuitions . These intuitions , indeed , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been achieved , any man might well ask himself why such matters had ever given any difficulty to the world . The role of Newton in the story has been the subject of recent controversy , and doubt has even been thrown upon his  | claim to have made the effective synthesis while still a very young man . It has been shown that , up to a period little short of this , his notes give no evidence of any exceptional ability ; but by 1665 ? 66 he was making important discoveries both in optics and in mathematics , while in respect of the gravitational theory his own retrospective account of his discoveries is not to be lightly dismissed . It would seem then that , acting independently , he had found the required formulae relating to centrifugal force in 1665 ? 66 , before the work of Huygens on this subject had been published . He had also discovered that the planets would move in something like conformity with Kepler 's laws if they were drawn towards the sun by a force which varied in inverse proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other words , he had succeeded in giving mathematical expression to the operation of the force of gravity . On the basis of these results he compared the force required to keep a stone in a sling or the moon in its orbit with the effect of gravity ( that is to say , with the behaviour of falling bodies at the earth 's surface ) . He found that the two corresponded if one made allowance for the fact that gravity varied inversely as the square of the distance . He treated the moon as though it had been a projectile tending to rush off in a straight line but pulled into a curve by the effect of the earth 's gravity ; and he found that the hypotheses fitted in with the theory that the force of universal gravitation varied inversely as the square of the distance . The fall which the moon had to make ( as a result of the earth 's drag ) every second , if it was to keep its circular path , bore the requisite proportion to the descent of the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story of Newton and the apple is historical and was bound to have at least a sort of typical validity ? for if it was not an apple it had to be some other terrestrial falling body that served as the basis for comparison . And the essential feat was the demonstration that when the new science of terrestrial mechanics was applied to the heavenly bodies the mathematics came out correctly . Newton would seem , therefore , to have achieved his essential synthesis in 1665 ? 66 , though he was dissatisfied with certain  | points in the demonstrations and put the work away for many years . In the middle of the 1660s , Borelli , Newton , Huygens and Hooke were wrestling with various parts of the same planetary problem , some of them also treading on one another 's heels in the study of the nature of light . Huygens had visited London , produced experiments for the Royal Society , corresponded with members of that Society , and tried out in England his pendulum clocks , which date back to 1657 . But in England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wren , William Croone , William Balle and Laurence Rooke appear to have inaugurated the enquiry into laws of motion , Robert Hooke performing most of the experiments . It is hardly possible to discover the influence that Huygens and the English scientists must have had on one another in the development of this work . The 1670s must represent one of the greatest decades in the scientific revolution , if not the climax of the whole movement ; and in both London and Paris there were circles of scientific workers whose achievements at this time were of a remarkable nature . So far as the gravitational theory is concerned , it is difficult to resist the view that in this period our attention ought to be directed not merely to Newton as an individual but to the combined operations of the English group . The Royal Society , we are told , following Baconian principles , sought to collect from all the world the data necessary for the establishment of the Copernican hypothesis ; and , perhaps ideally at least , its members were assisting one another , " freely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the names that are in the forefront are those of Isaac Newton , Robert Hooke , Edmond Halley and . Christopher Wren . Hooke is amazing in the number , the variety and the ingenuity of his experiments as well as for his extraordinary fertility in hypotheses . He followed Bacon in his attempts to demonstrate that the effects of gravity on a body must diminish as the body was sunk into the bowels of the earth . He sought to discover how far the effects were altered at great heights or in the region of the  | equator ; and he threw light on the problem by observations and experiments on the pendulum . From the globular shapes of the heavenly bodies and the stable conformation of the ridges on the moon he deduced that the moon and the planets had gravity ; and by 1666 he saw the motion of a comet ( for example ) as incurvated by the pull of the sun upon it , and suggested that the motion of the planets might be explicable on the kind of principles that account for the motion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this route one could arrive at a mechanical system of the planets which would be " the true perfection of astronomy " . He pointed out that , apart from the influence which the sun exerted on the planets , account had to be taken of the force which all the heavenly bodies must be presumed to be exerting on one another . By 1678 he had formulated the idea of gravitation as a universal principle ; and by 1679 he , too , had discovered that the diminution of the force of gravity is proportional to the square of the distance . In this period it would appear that Newton put on to paper some remarks which might suggest that he was unsure about his own earlier theory ; for the moment he seemed to be less firm in his apprehension than Hooke . At the same time he was called upon for mathematical help on various occasions . Some doubt seems to have been entertained ( especially amongst Englishmen ) on the subject of Kepler 's law relating to the elliptical orbit of the planets . Newton provided a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planets made it necessary to adopt the elliptical rather than the circular hypothesis . Hooke was to claim the priority in respect of the whole gravitational theory , and because Newton had been secretive about his work in 1665-66 , because many of Hooke 's own papers disappeared , and because Newton 's memory was defective sometimes ? or his accounts unreliable ? the controversy on this subject has been renewed in recent years . But , apart from the evidence of Newton 's earlier interest at least in the problem , Hooke did not produce the mathematical demonstration of his system . It can simply be said on his behalf that in the crucial period he was developing  | his mathematical powers more than was once imagined to be the case . His reputation has risen , with the development of historical research , therefore ; though the glory of Newton has not been eclipsed . It should be noted that , whereas Kepler had seen the planets as subject to forces which emanated from the sun , the view which Hooke had expounded and which Newton was to develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which the heavenly bodies all contributed to govern one another in a greater or lesser degree . The satellites of Jupiter leaned or reacted on one another as well as influencing the planet itself , while Jupiter in turn had a still more powerful hold upon them . The planet , however , together with its collection of satellites , was in the grip of the sun ( upon which it exerted its own small degree of attraction ) , and was also within range of the influence of neighbouring planets . As Newton remarked later , the sun was so preponderant amongst these bodies that the influence of the smaller ones mattered little and , similarly , one might make small account of the influence of the moon upon the earth . At the same time it had been noticed , especially in England , that when Jupiter and Saturn came into closest proximity with one another their movements showed an irregularity which was never observed at any other point in the course of their travels . Also the moon caused a slight alteration in the earth 's orbit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1846 astronomers were able to deduce the existence of still another planet ? Neptune ? before the planet had actually been observed . The whole system was therefore much more complicated in the 167os than had been envisaged in the early part of the century ? the whole sky presented a more intricate set of mathematical harmonies . It was to be the virtue of the new theory of the skies that it explained some of the minor anomalies , and embraced a world of interactions much more comprehensive than anything which Kepler had envisaged . It was in the middle of the 1680s that Isaac Newton returned to the problem . His greatest difficulty had apparently been due  | to the fact that though gravity operates , as we have seen , between all particles of matter , he had to make his calculations from one mathematical point to another ? from the centre of the moon to the centre of the earth , for example . In 1685 he was able to prove , however , that it was mathematically correct to act upon this assumption ? as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its centre , so that the whole of its gravity could be regarded as operating from that point . It happened furthermore that though in the middle ' 6os the data upon which he worked may not have been radically wrong , still in 1684 he was able to make use of more accurate observations and calculations ; for in 1672 a French expedition under Jean Picard had enabled simultaneous measurements of the altitude of Mars to be taken in Cayenne and in Paris , and the results of the expedition made it possible to secure a more accurate estimate of the sun 's mean distance from the earth ? which was worked out at 87 million miles , coming nearer to the modern calculation of 92 million ? as well as revealing still more vividly the magnitude of the solar system . It was even possible now to have more accurate measurements of the dimensions of the earth itself . The achievements of this expedition , although they had found their way into print at an earlier date , only became widely known after a publication of 1684 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made his final calculations and produced his system . In the middle ' 8os , therefore , there were converging reasons for his return to the problem he had been dealing with twenty years before ; and this time he was satisfied with his results and demonstrations , which were completed in 1686 and communicated to the world in the Principia in 1687 . One of Newton 's objects when he promulgated his system was to show the impossibility of that theory of vortices or whirlpools which Descartes had formulated . He showed that mathematically a whirlpool would not behave in the way that Descartes had assumed ? a planet caught in a whirlpool would not act in conformity with Kepler 's observations on the subject of planetary motion . Furthermore , it would not be possible  | for a comet to cut a straight path across the whole system , from one whirlpool to another , in the way that the theory required . In any case , if the whole of space were full of matter dense enough to carry round the planets in its whirlings , the strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowing down all the movements in the universe . On the other hand , it appears that even mathematicians did not immediately grasp the meaning and the importance of the Principia , and many people ? especially those who were under the influence of Descartes ? regarded Newton as unscientific in that he brought back on to the stage two things which had been driven out as superstitious ? namely , the idea of a vacuum and the idea of an influence which could operate across space between bodies that did not touch one another . His " attraction " was sometimes regarded as a lapse into the old heresies which had attributed something like occult properties to matter . Actually he denied that he had committed himself to any explanation of gravity , or to anything more than a mathematical description of the relations which had been found to exist between bodies of matter . At one moment , however , he seemed privately to favour the view that the cause of gravity was in the ether ( which became less dense at or near the earth , and least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravity representing the tendency of all bodies to move to the place where the ether was rarer . At another time he seemed to think that this gravitation of his represented an effect that had to be produced by God throughout the whole of space ? something that made the existence of God logically necessary and rescued the universe from the over-mechanisation that Descartes had achieved . And , as we have seen , Newton believed also that certain irregular phenomena in the skies ? rare combinations and conjunctures , or the passage of a comet ? were liable to cause a slight derangement in the clockwork , calling for the continued intervention of God . The great contemporaries , Huygens and Leibnitz , severely criticised the Newtonian system , and their work helped to strengthen thee position of the philosophy of Descartes in  | Europe for many years . They attempted mechanical explanations of gravity ? either imputing it to the action and pressure of subtle matter pervading the universe , or looking back to the idea of magnetism . The English in general supported Newton , while the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a controversy which continued well into the eighteenth century . Both Descartes and Newton were in the first rank of geometers ; but the ultimate victory of Newton has a particular significance for us in that it vindicated the alliance of geometry with the experimental method against the elaborate deductive system of Descartes . The clean and comparatively empty Newtonian skies ultimately carried the day against a Cartesian universe packed with matter and agitated with whirlpools , for the existence of which scientific observation provided no evidence .  | THE TRANSITION TO THE PHILOSOPHE MOVEMENT IN THE REIGN OF LOUIS XIV WE have now glanced at what seem to be the strategic lines in the story of the seventeenth-century scientific revolution , and we have seen how that revolution was particularly connected with the study of motion both on the earth and in the sky , the story reaching its culmination in that synthesis of astronomy and mechanics which was achieved in the system of Sir Isaac Newton . The point at which we have now arrived must stand as one of the great moments in the history of human experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newton could not say what were the causes of gravitation , still it emerges from the whole narrative that here was one of those occasions when , by solving this problem and that , men acquired new habits of mind , new methods of enquiry ? almost incidentally , so to speak , they founded modern science . Furthermore , they discovered in the system of Newton that earth and sky could be comprised in a single survey and reduced to one fundamental system of law , and this tended to alter their attitude to the whole universe . ' We have already seen that conscious attempts were made to extend the mechanistic system itself , as well as the scientific methods which had given such great results in physics , to cover also the case of chemical phenomena and to embrace even the field of biology . We have seen also that in conscious correspondence with this mechanistic system ancient atomic philosophies had been resurrected or were being moulded into new forms . It is not often that the historian can sweep into a single cluster such a wide range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of man 's outlook . All this , however , represents only a small corner in that vast range of significance which the scientific revolution possesses ;  | and we should be wrong if now we did not turn aside for a moment to study the repercussions of the new thought upon the life and society of the seventeenth century . The history of science ought not merely to exist by itself in a separate pocket , and if we have isolated certain aspects of it and put the microscope on these , we have done so on the view that at this point in the narrative the intellectual changes had significance for general history in its broadest sense . It would be useful now , therefore , if we were to go back to the number we first thought of and see where the scientific movement of the seventeenth century finds its place in the total story of civilisation . In this connection we can hardly do better than take up the story precisely at the point which we have actually reached in our account of the scientific revolution ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have come into its own . The galvanic period even for our present purposes seems to lie in that decade of the 168os when , as we have already seen , a handful of scientists in both London and Paris were crowning the story with remarkable achievements ; in fact , the years which came to their peak in 1687 with the publication of Newton 's Principia . In order to understand the developments that took place we can not begin better than by putting our fingers on the principal agent in the transmission of the results of the scientific movement to the outside world in this period ? namely , the French writer Fontenelle . He is the most important single link between the scientific revolution and the philosophe movement . He has a special interest for us because he lived from 1657 to 1757 and spanned the great transition with which we are now concerned . And he is instructive because on the one hand he is in a sense the first of the French philosophes ; while on the other hand he invented and exploited a whole technique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sciences from 1699 to 1741 , and it may be useful first of all to take some evidence which he supplies in his famous Eloges ? the funeral orations on a great number of the scientists of this period , which he gave in his capacity as secretary of the Academy . After examin-  | ing what is a critical point in the intellectual transition we shall later try to find the place of the whole story in a wider survey of the history of civilisation , so as to bring out some further aspects of the passage to what we usually call the age of reason . If we were grading forms of historical evidence , most of us would be inclined to put funeral orations into the lowest and least trustworthy class of all . But it often happens in the case of any class of document that a witness is most important in the things that he was not intending to give away , and the historian is in the position of a detective ? there is not anything in the world which may not provide him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely subtle and diplomatic narrator , and even in what was supposed to be eulogy he could manage without offence to draw attention to the weaknesses of this scientist or that ? as in the case of one man who was unduly jealous both of his colleagues and of inferiors . At the same time he seems to have used the orations in order to conduct a kind of propaganda on behalf of the scientific movement , and interesting things emerge from the character of that propaganda ? for example , where he tilts against prevailing educational methods or against religious prejudice there is a considerable amount of information concerning the controversies of the time . It is , however , by collating a great number of his short biographies and comparing the narratives that we discover some of the most interesting of the sidelights which Fontenelle was particularly well situated to provide . There is always a stage in the historiography of a movement , or a revolution , or a war , which might be described as the " heroic age " ? the primitive period in the writing-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their trophies and exult in the overthrow of the enemy , or , in the spirit of the Orangemen , hold commemorative dinners . There is a sense in which the Eloges of Fontenelle may be said to contribute something to our picture because they provide us with just this saga of the scientific revolution . If we examine some illustrations , it is not the names of particular scientists that matter or the specific things said about them .  | What concerns us , rather , is the pattern adopted in these biographies and the cumulative effect of the series as a whole . It is clear from the character of this collection of lives that we are now dealing not with lonely pioneers like Galileo , but with a movement that is on the way to becoming generalised . It would appear from Fontenelle 's biographies that those who joined the movement often sprang from bourgeois families , and remarkably often they are the sons of avocats , as he himself happened to be . Repeatedly it appears that they had originally been intended for the Church and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theology . But over and over again the same pattern occurs in these biographies ? the youth fmds the prevailing educational methods irksome , finds that he is being given an education in mere words and not in real things . And then , on repeated occasions , the identical fairystory seems to take place . Of one person , Bernoulli , we are told that he saw some geometrical figures by chance and immediately responded to their charms ? proceeding later to a study of the philosophy of Descartes . Another , Amontons , found himself deaf after an illness and had to cut short his formal education ? so now he could turn his mind to whatever he pleased , and he began to study machines and dedicated himself to a design for the production of perpetual motion . Regis was intended for the Church , and , while he was getting tired of the length of time which he had to spend on an unimportant line of work , he chanced upon the Cartesian philosophy and immediately was struck by it . Tournefort discovered the philosophy of Descartes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was the thing his mind had been looking for . Louis Cane was the same ? he was to have been a priest , but the prospect was disgusting to him ; then he discovered the philosophy of Descartes which opened up a new universe for him . Malebranche was so transported on reading Descartes , that he gave up everything else for the sake of the study of his philosophy . Varignon picked up a volume of Euclid by chance , and , charmed to see the contrast between this and the sophistries  | and obscurities that he had been taught in the schools , he allowed himself to be led by geometry to the reading of Descartes who came to him as a new light . The Dutchman , Boerhaave , was training for theology , but having tumbled upon geometry he could not resist it because of its invincible charm . It is all like the Christians recounting conversions in the early stages of a religious movement , when one man after another sees the light and changes the course of his whole life , And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation , glad to be emancipated from the burden or routine or prejudice of the old one . Everything is still in the heroic period  --  the scientific view comes as a new revelation and its apostles are counting their conquests . And a particular agent in the transition is geometry , especially the influence of Descartes , which was very powerful at this time . Fontenelle 's biographical sketches , furthermore , give evidence concerning the curious social success of the sciences in the reign of Louis XIV . As we survey them we find that the period of the 168os comes out with peculiar vividness , especially as at this point he speaks very often as an eyewitness , and gives us what are really glimpses into his autobiography . It was probably from about 168o that he himself was meeting some of the leading members of the new movement , and by 1683 or 1684 he had established himself in definite contact with it . This means that he came into direct touch with the scientists at an exhilarating moment ? at one of the peak points in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time he was only in the middle twenties , and had over seventy years longer to live , not only did his most vivid impressions belong to this period , but much of his permanent outlook was established by this date . We learn that Paris was full of foreigners who came to attend the conferences or observe the demonstrations of various scientists ? in one year there were as many as forty people from Scotland alone who came to hear the famous chemist Lemery . Crowds of women attended Lemery 's courses ? carried away by the prevailing fashion , we are  | told ? and as a result of his popularity his medicinal preparadons became the vogue . Regis , the philosopher , had provided a stimulus in Toulouse , where he had awakened in both the clergy and the magistrates an interest in Cartesianism ; and in 168o he had come to Paris , where " the concourse of people was great ? so great that a private house could not conveniently hold them ; people came to make sure of seats long before the time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Italian theatre came to learn the philosophy of Descartes ; but the impression produced by Regis was so sensational that the Archbishop of Paris put an end to the sessions . Another man , Du Verney the anatomist , attracted young ladies to the study of his subject . " Anatomy , hitherto confined to the schools of medicine , " writes Fontenelle , " now dared to come out into the beau monde . " He adds : " I remember having seen people of the beau monde carrying away the dried specimens which he had prepared in order to show them in their own circles . " Later , when he was Professor at the Jardin Royal , this man Du Verney had great crowds of students , 140 foreigners attending his courses in a single year . We learn more about a group of men from Normandy who formed an interesting circle in Paris , including Fontenelle himself , Varignon the famous geometer , the well-known Abbe de Saint Pierre , and Vertot an historian . We learn of aristocratic patronage ? how Lemery the chemist came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conde , where many learned men assembled ; while Du Verney was asked to assist in the education of the Dauphin , and then had a more distinguished audience than ever at his conferences . Fontenelle makes the interesting note that mathematics made a good profit in the 168os , though he adds the significant remark that the outbreak of the great war in 1688 ? the war between Louis XIV and William III ? had a bad effect on this . Then in 1686 Fontenelle produced his famous dialogue entitled The Plurality of Worlds ? the first work in France which made the discoveries of science clear , intelligible and amusing to the general reading-public . In many respects this book  | would stand as a model for works of scientific popularisation that have appeared down to the present day . Fontenelle consciously set out to make science amusing to fashionable ladies and as easy as the latest novel , and in this connection it is important to note that he had begun life as a writer before he ever turned to science ? he was a literary man manque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In one sense he was typical of the whole French philosophe movement of the eighteenth century which he helped to inaugurate . The results of the scientific revolution were precipitately and hastily translated into a new world-view , and this work was carried out not so much by scientists as by men of letters . Fontenelle wrote some mathematical works , but he was not himself important as a scientist ? he is not remembered by any actual scientific discovery of his own . He was the proper person to write the funeral orations because he was somewhat versatile and familiarised himself with many sciences , so that he could appraise the discoveries of specialists in widely different fields . As a man of the world he saw what was fashionable and produced just what was wanted ? bringing out his work on The Plurality of Worlds in the year before the publication of the Principia , and giving the general picture of the heavens as this had been achieved in the pre-Newtonian period . He invented , and carried to extremes , a playful style , based on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with devices of exposition that are so ingenious and witty that they end by becoming tedious at times . " A mixture of the pedant and the precieux calculated to go down well with the bourgeoisie and the provinces " , somebody has said . He did not merely popularise the scientific achievement of the seventeenth century . It is important to note that the literary man intervenes at this crucial stage of the story and performs a second function ? the translation of the scientific achievement into a new view of life and of the universe . Many of the scientists of the seventeenth century had been pious Protestants and Catholics , and in this very period both Robert Boyle and Isaac Newton showed considerable fervour concerning their
