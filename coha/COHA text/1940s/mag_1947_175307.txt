" Poems can be read or spoken , melodies can be played or whistled , but words and music were blended into song , and a song was written to be sung . " <P> This pronouncement on choral singing is the cornerstone of the new Fred Waring summer school of music in Delaware . Last week 560 music teachers from the U.S. , Canada , Mexico , Hawaii and the Philippines had absorbed their lessons and were on their way back home to spread the Waring message to 1,500,000 students and concertgoers . It will not be long , Waring thinks , until practically everybody in the U.S. will be singing Waring-style . <P> Rhythm Antics . This year , as he celebrates his soth anniversary in show business , Fred Waring 's big enthusiasm is his new career as a teacher . For a long time he and his top musicians have trooped around the country to hold classes in the Waring technique , especially as it fits choral singing . Waring , who thinks his own chorus is the best on the air , complains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in radio is singing . " <P> Last winter , sure that the time had come to open up a school , he started converting a country club he bought four years ago at Shawnee , Del. into a schoolhouse . The protests of his neighbors at the flossy resort were drowned in a noisy rush of students ready to pay $85 for a week of Waring 's lessons . What the students got was a Waring extravaganza . <P> At Shawnee , the courses included enunciation , programing and " how we acquire balance . " Students sat in on rehearsals and broadcasts , got pointers on microphone technique , learned how to tap time properly with the feet ( the heel , not the toe ) . They were also exposed to such Waring inspirations as Tone-Syllables , a phonetic method of lyric singing ( " Mah-ee Bahn-nee lah-ee-zo-oo-vuhr thee o-oo-shun " ) . By the end of the eight-week semester , all the students , including eight nuns , were fairly groovy . <P> And Money , Too . The session also offered tips on another Waring formula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The students at Shawnee could hardly have found a more knowing instructor . The 75 musicians and minnesingers known as Waring 's Pennsylvanians have outlasted many a more popular band and are apparently imperishable . Last week , Fred was lining up a new NBC show for the fall ( sponsored by General Electric ) . <P> At 47 , the Waring profile is sagging slightly , but the Waring temperament is as sharp as ever . " I 'm a perfectionist , " explains Fred in his twangy Pennsylvania Tone-Syllables . He can make the claim as both showman and businessman . The Waring Corp . ( whose Waring Mixer is a U.S. kitchen and barroom standby ) is still doing nicely . So are the Waring Musical Library , the Shawnee Press ( which sells the Waring choral arrangements ) , concert bookings , recordings . All told , the Waring enterprises gross the Maestro " at least " $2 million a year .
