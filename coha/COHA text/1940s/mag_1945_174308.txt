Folks at home began to feel embarrassed . Almost since the war started , they had innocently used the term " G.I. Joe . " Then from Santa Barbara , Calif. , came a report that soldiers resented it , thought it patronizing . Hearst Columnist Damon Runyon gave his old-soldier version of the name : " For over 40 years a Joe has meant a Jasper , a Joskin , a yokel , a hey-rube , a hick , a clodhopper , a sucker . " Runyon remembered that in the last war G.I. ( i.e. , " government issue " ) meant " the big galvanized iron garbage and ash can in the back of each company barracks . " <P> Other columnists and letter writers took up the protest . The New York Times lectured : " The U.S. soldier is never a nameless character in a comic strip , and maybe we should stop treating him as such . " <P> But recently came a note of reassurance from abashed users of the opprobrious phrase . Stars &; Stripes Reporter Jimmy Cannon had asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He reported : they do n't give a damn what they 're called .
