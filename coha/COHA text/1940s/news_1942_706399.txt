txt Would Scrap Street Canopies There is a crying need for metal scrap for our steel and iron mills . In this city there is plenty of scrap in the form of the framework of the street canopies , extending from the entrances of apartment houses to the curb . The owners of these buildings should donate this to the government for distribution where the need is urgent . The canvas canopies could be used for tarpaulins by the armed forces after remaking . The landlord is relieved of the maintenance of the contraptions and the doorman goes back to the good old umbrella . Further , at , least for the duration , the use of the canopies should be prohibited , because they are impediments during a blackout and a fire hazard in an air raid . Their practical benefits are problematical and only serve at best to add a little " class " to the entrance . JOHN I. CONROY . New York , May 1 , 1942.                  @ @ @
