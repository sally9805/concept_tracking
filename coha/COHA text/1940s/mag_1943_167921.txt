A slippery spy was John Jacob Napp , who kept a Buenos Aires waterfront saloon . Arrested , he sang on his boss as well as his subordinates ( TIME , Dec. 28 ) and last week furnished Argentina 's Supreme Court with evidence necessary to open legal proceedings against German Naval Attach Captain Dietrich Niebuhr . At the request of the Court , the Foreign Office demanded that the German Embassy waive Niebuhr 's diplomatic immunity and permit him to stand trial . <P> This put the German Embassy in a hole . If the Embassy agreed , Niebuhr 's conviction seemed inevitable ; if it refused , the spying captain would be self-convicted by implication , and would probably have to sit in the safety of the extraterritorial German Embassy for the duration . In either case , Niebuhr would be of no further use as a spy .
