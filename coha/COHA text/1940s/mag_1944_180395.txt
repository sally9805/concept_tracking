The children never smile . Their dread of cold is so great that , when brought into warm rooms , they fight desperately for the spot nearest the fire .

Someone asks a little girl why she is so silent . She answers : " Why do you smile ?

To some chil dren it had caused mental damage so severe that " Soviet authorities feared it would be permanent .
