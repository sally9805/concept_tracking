T HERE has been much talk of late , in Britain , and in America , too , of the fallen and tottering small nations of Europe  --  of Czechoslovakia and Poland , of Finland and the Baltic states , of Hungary and the Balkans , even of Belgium and the Netherlands and the Scandinavian kingdoms . There has been no word at all of Ireland . And yet , Ireland , as far as England and the United Stales , and possibly Germany , are concerned , is one of the most important small nations in Europe . Small as she is , she is one of the great mother nations , and her blood flows in a strong stream  --  not sluggishly  --  through the British Empire and many of your states . Possibly this silence has been subtly suggested by the British Foreign Office for its own purposes . The British Foreign Office is quite capable of anything in the game it forever plays , as America ought to know . Well , let is talk of Ireland and be damned to the diplomatic corps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago , Ireland established her own government  --  not for the whole of Ireland , but for most of it  --  after hundreds of years of struggling servitude . In the twenty years that have elapsed , we Irish have been struggling tooth and nail to create  --  to re-create  --  our own image of life . We have suffered many discomforts to do it , and the work is far from finished ; we have hundreds of years of leeway to make up , but the work is now well founded . Much has been said in mockery of the Treaty of Versailles and President Wilson . It is fashionable to treat them as a bitter joke . But the Versailles Treaty , thanks largely to Wilson , released old life that was being choked , and created new life that , in a peaceful Europe , might have given the world much of value and interest . We , in Ireland , look at the map of Europe today and see what is left of this freedom and cultural urge . Czechoslovakia is gone ; Albania is gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave danger ; the Baltic states are tottering ; the Balkans are anybody 's game . Not even Sweden , Denmark and Holland are secure . We ask ourselves : " How secure is Ireland ? " If this war should end in the domination of one power by a victorious enemy , what reason has Ireland to believe that she will be permitted to live and develop  --  always develop  --  her own ancient way of life without interference ? No matter who emerges as the actual or moral victor , the whole economic structure of Europe will be so shaken that we know well that our freedom of action as an independent , self-reliant , economic unit wilt he seriously impaired . And so , the present mood of Ireland is one of serious apprehension for the future , and a coldly detached , if not completely cynical , appreciation of the ideologies of the combatants . The New Era in Erin AT CONSIDERABLE cost and pain , we have been trying at top speed to exploit and industrialize what has been kept for 100 years a vast pasturage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fattened . It is almost unbelievable that , until recently , we imported largo quantities , for home consumption , of inferior-quality foods which we ourselves produced in a luxury standard for sale to England . That we have absolutely stopped . There is nothintron offer for home consumption now but the best Irish bacon , beef , nmtton , butter , eggs and poultry . Of other foods for which we once depended almost entirely on foreign supplies we now produce , to take a few examples , 00 per cent in sugar , 35 per cent in wheat , practically 100par cent in vegetables . including tomatoes , and an ever-increasing percentage of fruit . We shall he a wonderful orchard country later on . The comparative figures are striking . Whereas foreign bacon , eggs , fats , meat and butter to the value of $10,000 , n041 were imported into Ireland as recently as 1031 , five years later the figure was only one fifth of that sum . Cereals and feeding stuffs worth $40,000,000 came into Ireland under the old British regime . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothing annually . We now manufacture up to $20,000,000 worth ourselves . All sorts of industrial products once wholly imported are now being manufactured in Ireland , in small , decentralized factories , scattered through the green fields of Ireland . We , who once never manufactured anything except a few homespuns , now make such specialized things as safety-razor blades , motor springs , dry batteries , typewriter ribbons , carbon paper , enameled hollow ware , cutlery , wall paper , golf balls , motor tires , aluminum goods , copper tubing , rubber boots , bolts and nuts , tennis halls , bakelite goods , glass bottles , even motor spirit , and so on . We propose to spend , and have itt part spent , $100,000,000 ? ? 20,000,000 ? on housing ; nearly half a million on milk for the poor ehildren ; we subsidize a **27;1572;TOOLONG scheme . The idle grazing lands are being bought over by the state and divided among landless men at the rate  --  a heavy rate for this country  --  of 100.000 acres a year . Considerable headway has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education . Ireland is now being dotted all over with rural hospitals than which there is none better equipped in the world . The State subsidizes three theaters . I do not say it is all perfect . We love to have our grumble in Ireland , and we have high standards . I mention these things merely to indicate that Ireland has been getting on her feet during the past twenty years as a self-supporting country . Of course , some of our huckstering politicians look hack on the good old days of huckstering , when our whole economic policy was mere selling and buying , not making ; when our well-to-do people in an emptying , emigrant land were cattle jobbers , publir'an shopkeepers , and British commercial agents . It is so easy to sell and buy . l It takes a man to make , and a huckster never made anything , except excess profits . But it was England 's policy to keep us an emigrant country , as she keeps Scotland today  --  a place where there was the best of food for England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aborigine  --  a place to visit in summer and forget in the winter . In a word , we were England 's floating raft . England , with her wealth and her needs , has always that effect on the nations under her dominance ; especially if that nation was developing a sense of her own nationhood . See how carefully she never gave us the monopoly of her food market ; which might have given us too much power . She had that debilitating effect on your America before the Revolution , when you were a small nation along the Eastern seaboard . Yoe tore yourselves free in eight bitter years , thanks largely to 3000 miles of sea . Ireland has torn herself partially free in six centuries : and Scotland , who was England 's willing partner , is now beginning to wonder how she , too , can escape , and keep her body and soul alive . Lastly , I am a writer , and my interests are books and sport . Of both need say nothing as far as Ireland is concerned , though 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Irish horses . We produce , for so small an island , more artists to the square mile than any country in the world  --  and that is a challenge . In drama , poetry and the novel , we have shown that we are a distinct and a distinguished people . Indeed , I might say that when England lent us her language , we gave her , in return , her literature . It is a commonplace that from Sheridan to Shaw , and Congreve to Oscar Wilde , every notable dramatist in these islands was an Irishman . London journalism is controlled by Englishmen , but run by the Scots and the Irish . That tradition goes on . The generation of Yeats and Shaw , and George Moore and sE , is passing away , but writers continue to appear in Ireland as numerous and as vital as ever . There is , therefore , no field of human activity in which Ireland can not supply most of her needs . She is a self-contained nation , although I emporarily partitioned and deprived of six of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her future is , so far , in her own hands . She has at long last entered into the comity of the free nations of the earth . No bar to her expansion exists which she can not , in time , surmount . She feels that she has , now , the good will of the greater part of the world , as she has always had the good will of the United States . The Edge of the Maelstrom Is it any wonder , then , that Ireland is perturbed at her possible destiny in this war that is likely to devastate Europe ? Ireland , with all her ambitions and hopes so thick upon her , feels too near the drag of the maelstrom to be happy about it . Luckily for her , it is the first war in her long life story in which she can declare her neutrality . In 1914-1918 , she lost 50,000 of the flower of her manhood , all volunteers  --  in that war to end war . These volunteers were brought in by John Redmond , the Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a promise that was subsequently denied by a British government . Her entire manpower , so well fitted to be shock troops for England , so often used as such all over the world , would have been conscripted , had it not been for the defiance of Sinn Fein . Her shipping was submarined . Every scheme for her development was shelved indefinitely . She did not evade one single effect of that war which the greater part of England did not equally evadeunless it he , alone , the Zeppelin and plane bombing raids . Today , so far immune , every Irishman is asking : " How long can we keep out of it ' ? " For every Irishman is aware of the importance of Ireland 's position in a general European warfare . Your American naval strategists know that too . Ireland has proclaimed her neutrality . What does that mean ? It means that the British and German governments have up to now respected Ireland 's claim to that neutrality . But there is a certain nervousness lest any attempt be made by one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Problems of Neutrality The Irish government has taken all possible steps to avoid giving the least cause for complaint to any of the belligerents , and to insure that neutrality is real in every sense . As it result , Dublin is effectively blacked out every night . No public lighting is allowed which can not be switched off , totally , at a second 's notice . For ten miles inland along the southwest coast , all lights are dimmed to prevent sky glare . No weather reports are published . Coast watchers are on the lookout night and day along the Irish shores . The Irish army has been recruited to full strength . There is a strict military censorship on news . All uncomplimentary references to the personnel of all foreign governments are forbidden . The northeast corner of Ireland , which is still held forcibly from Ireland by ( beat Britain , houses depots for the famous old-time Irish regiments of the British army . such as the Royal lnniskillings and the Rossd Ulster Rifles and the new London Iris ? Regiment ; these regiments may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eire . Certain reexports , such as petrol , are not allowed . All transmit brig wireless sets are taboo . In short , the Irish government , having agreed to give direct aid to neither combatant , has proclaimed and illustrated its neutrality as best it . can . That neutrality has been hitherto recognized by both sides , But , again , the nervousness . One can so easily foresee crises that will test it . A test may come when the British merchant navy begins to ship from Irish ports foodstuffs badly needed in England . At the opening of war , Britain was not in serious need of our food supplies , and exports were too normal to attract . anybody 's attention . The German U-boats may attack the transporting ships . Now , Irish trade depends almost entirely on the British consumer and the merchant service . British-Irish trade communications being cut , our neutrality will suffer the direct attack of economic war . Arid although the whole aim of the Irish government is to give no foreign power the slightest ground for impugning before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared neutrality , it could not , in that impasse , refuse British convoys . The convoys and convoyed would , it is true , be mainly British ships . Everybody knows how little is needed in the tense atmosphere of war to create a situation that might have the most serious results for Ireland . Ireland , like many of the smaller nations , is alive to the danger of being involved in the war against all her desires ; this by reason of her proximity to England , her direct trade relations with England , and the presence on Irish soil , in Ulster , of armed British troops , aerodromes , munition factories and training camps . Of these , the trade relations  --  that is , Ireland as England 's larder  --  are the most combustible element . If Germany , in a word , ever objects on this score  --  and in a protracted war nothing is more likely  --  then Irish neutrality will hang by the slightest thread . So also in certain circumstances might the United States ' neutrality hang by a thread against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be aware of how neatly the diplomatists can cut thread . Can Ireland protect herself ? Ultimately , yes ; immediately , no . The last Irish Army Estimates asked for a bare 56.000,000 . The British Army Estimates at the same time were about eighty times that sum . They have since multiplied themselves too rapidly and consecutively for computation . The regular Irish army , plus the volunteers  --  a territorial or militia force  --  is not . large . The air force , though efficient , is small . The supply of arms is just adequate , though ; since the manufacturers of the Bren gun , in favor of which the Lewis gun has been scrapped , are too busy supplying arms elsewhere , we may well find a serious shortage of machine guns . The army is mechanized . But these facts bear no realistic relation to Ireland 's capacity for self-defense . The Irish army , attacked by a strong power , would never take the field as an army unit . Ireland 's traditional method of lighting is the guerrilla war . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was for equipment. ? I knew men to fight armed British patrols with stones and sticks  --  she held at bay fifty-one battalions , six cavalry regiments , and a host of police , Black-and-Tans , official and semiofficial agents , totaling 60,000 men . We proved then to other struggling nations that the only unerushable method of resistance to the great mechanized powers is the old method of the elusive . invisible , resolute ambush and raid . Palestine , India and China all used that method . Short of extermination , we say : Look at our history to see what we ran endure , England 's Machiavellis Neither Germany nor England , then , could hold Ireland down without paying a high price for it  --  more than the game would he worth . Nevertheless , no Irishman , and no friend of Ireland , can contemplate such a ruthless struggle with anything but dismay . There is no doubt about it that , if this war is a prolonged conflict , Ireland will become politically of more and more importance in the general European game and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States now , as she did in 1914 , for moral , financial and , later on , military support . And Ireland plays a part in the history of Anglo-American relationships . No matter how your President , or your Foreign Office , or your press may assure you about your neutrality  --  at least , about your military neutrality  --  we Irish tell you that England is quietly confident of bringing you in on her side , with all your ships , and all your bonny fighting men , and all your money besides . The British diplomatic corps will do the job neatly , as usual . You are afraid ? You may well be afraid . Here in Ireland we say that England is hard to beat in a pitched field , but that she is capable of defeat . But , we add , around the green-cloth council table she is absolutely invincible . Do n't heed Hitler 's apparent victories , such as Munich or the forestalling of the Anglo-Soviet pact . England played her own game every time . We know ! We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table  --  and we are no slouchers at a talkfest  --  but these Englishmen bested us every time without taking the wraps off , even if they once had to use the threat of " Immediate and terrible war . " We came away with our tails between our legs and we bit each other 's ears when we got home . Here in Ireland we say : " When you meet British diplomats , lift the green cloth to see the cloven hoof . If you see it , carry on . The devil is a straightforward sort of gentleman as compared with British diplomacy ; you have some hope of seeing what . he is driving at ; be of good heart . But . if you see no cloven hoof , then throw up your hands and surrender . The game is as goud as up . " That is our idea of British diplomacy , and we 've had hundreds of years ' experience with it . Our mainstay of hope for the future is that Ireland 's influence abroad will make itself felt again , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We feel that neither Britain nor Germany will wish to antagonize a large body of American opinion by assailing Irish neutrality . On the other hand , we feel that this large body of organized opinion in America , sympathetic to Ireland , will indubitably be influenced by British treatment of outstanding Irish national grievances . These are two . ( t ) Great Britain insists on holding six counties out of the thirty-two counties of Ireland as a military base and a political subordinate possession . ( 2 ) Great Britain stolidly refuses to recognize the sovereignty of Ireland . Now we are at the crux of the business . The effect of England 's stubborn refusal to withdraw her financial and military support from the six-county puppet parliament which holds the northeast corner of Ireland for the Empire is to make Ireland sullen . Ireland thereby cheated , at the founding of the Irish Free State , out of one fifth of her island territory , still re gards England as her chief enemy  --  as the old enemy of 600 years , the subtle enemy that created the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inveterate and persistent enemy who , in that six-county fortress , reserved her means to reconquer Ireland when the time became ripe again . Why , otherwise , does she not give us back this fourth of our green fields ? What . does she want it for ? I do not think anybody would deny that the mass of Irish opinion is sympathetic to the democracies , or that a straw vote would show that the majority of the Irish people hope for the ultimate victory of the Anglo-French alliance  --  with stress on the French ! The Russo-German alliance has consolidated that , and the Irish Church is naturally anti-Nazi and anti-Soviet . But the Irish people are under no sentimental illusions . They know the trend of their sympathies is a choice between evils . They know that the war is , in the main , a war between imperialists . In preferring to see Great Britain win the war , they are simply following the old Irish proverb which says , " The divil you know is better than the divil you do n't know . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . We in Ireland can not he impressed by the suggestion that the allies went to war in defense of Poland , or that in this present war Great Britain is defending some fundamental right , or rights , so long as we ourselves are being held to Britain 's mooring mast by the hawser of one of her typical alien garrisons in the northeast corner of our country . Even now a British statesman has stated that Great Britain is not at war to restore the Poland of the Versailles Treaty . Over a million and a quarter Irish people are still held under British rule in these six counties of the north . Every man jack of that million and a quarter is Irish , and insists on being known as Irish , though many of them are bogy-ridden and witch-doctor ridden into maintaining a well-oiled political machine , run by a clique , in power . You know well what I mean ; you know how a corrupt but well organized political machine can rule a city or a county or even a state . By means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irish are in every way as ruthlessly held within the British Empire as were the remaining twenty-six counties , up to the revolt of Sinn Fein and the establishment of the Free State . That puppet-parliament clique which controls them has no other purpose than to keep them so . It has gagged all opposition , interned and imprisoned all who dare to resist , gerrymandered every constituency so as to prevent areas with preponderant majorities from expressing their hatred of their rulers , swamped the whole region with armed police , proclaimed every public meeting called to protest , in every possible way assailed the civil liberties of one third of Ireland 's population , and then given out to all inquirers that these six counties really like to be ruled that way . Above all , there reigns here the most outrageous religious bigotry imaginable . No Catholic can , in effect , hold any lucrative post unless he abjures everything that hinds north and south , every spiritual and cultural symbol that is dear to the heart of the Irishman . The higher Civil Service is closed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Catholics of Great . Britain and Ireland alike suffered all these same disabilities , until that great Irish leader , Daniel O'Connell , liberated them all . Today , that Emancipation writ does not run in Northern Ireland . There is here a helot class , which talks beneath its breath and is condemned to perpetual inferiority by the positive , pronounced and deliberate policy of the British government . The Polish Parallel No doubt , our old friends , the suave , Eton-bred , so easily touched , so easily shocked , so civilized diplomatic corps , will give you many plausible , shoulder-shrugging reasons for this partition of Ireland  --  every reason but the obvious one , that Northern Ireland is an ideal jumping-off ground for the British army . They will even , it is possible , murmur , with polite effrontery  --  that sweet politeness of the Englishman , which is worse than a blow in the face  --  that Great Britain is not to blame . And , reader , you will find yourself believing it . After an hour with one of these chaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won , today , in the way of immunity from the horrors of an imperialistic war , she has won by force and with the aid of world  --  and largely American  --  opinion . If Mr. Chamberlain was prepared to permit the Sudeten Germans to return to their Fatherland , why , we ask , was he not prepared to permit the Irish people in the north to return to the bosom of their motherland ? Mr. Churchill can weep over the fate of Poland and the fate of Czechoslovakia . That same Churchillism let hell loose in Ireland for four years , trampled the national aspirations of Ireland as ruthlessly as the Nazi storm troopers trampled the Poles and the Czechs . Ireland was an ancient and civilized land when Poland 's ancient civilization was submerged in the Dark Ages . If it sears the hearts of the English Tories to see Poland Sovietized , I tell them that it is just as painful to us to see one third of our race being Anglicized . Ireland 's declaration of neutrality is , therefore , not only her claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition , acid in part , her gesture of disbelief , or at any rate of reserved trust , in the alleged idealisms of the western powers , especially England . India 's dissatisfaction with Britain 's side-stopping declarations about her future form of government is fully understood in Ireland . Greater India 's unwillingness to be involved in the war is fully understood in Ireland . The refusal of South Africa to be more than nominally involved is fully understood in Ireland . We Irish simply say that we do not know what are the war aims of Britain and France , and before Ireland can alter her present attitude , these war aims must be defined , and related to herself . We are willing to shake hands with England  --  when these English hands are clean . We Irish trust and hope , and with all our might appeal that no American will ever wish to enter this European conflict until the war aims of the democracies are stated in the most clear and unambiguous language . We make that appeal in the name of the small nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , have found themselves invaded , harried , disturbed and impoverished by the ambitions of the dynasts . This little island of ours has seen Europe grow . We may well boast a little . We have helped Europe to emerge from barbarism to civilization . When the British ran through their woods painted like American Indians . we Irish were making the most delicate , and today priceless , objects of art . We preserved the language and letters of Greece when the Dark Ages hart fallen on Europe . The footmarks of Irish scholars all over Europe , ire those early centuries  --  from the fifth to the twelfth  --  are the signposts of emergent culture on the continent .. Through the centuries we have nourished the flame of our own particular philosophy of life . And as we look about . us today we ask ourselves whether that flame that we nourish on our modest hearths , in our little island home , may not have some quality of purity and perfection that all the furnaces of the dynasts can never produce . The giants about us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have destroyed almost as much as they created . They have brought ruin , misery and disaster on Europe in every generation . We may well ask : " Have these dynasts lost all touch with what we may call the primitive beatitudes  --  those simplest , but most necessary virtues which , however deeply buried , are the true sap of human civilization ? Can it he that it is only in small nations , with modest ambitions , that man can find hope today for the continuity and preservation of the things that are most precious to mankind  --  tolerance , charity , restraint , justice ? " Americans ! Many of you have traveled in body , and many more in spirit , over this quiet island on the rim of Europe . Larger countries have more magnificent things to show . We admire them , and we enjoy them , and we have profited by them . But I believe that what we have created in Ireland , and are creating , is no less precious , in its own sphere , not merely to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine quality of spirit in every human endeavor . There is here , and many of you have seen it and enjoyed it , a gentle mode of life such as only great age , and innate culture , and high heart , and long experience , can create in any land . Austria had it , and she was crushed . Finland has it , too , and she , too , is assailed . You may have felt it and loved it , too , down the Rhine into Bavaria , which like-wise is being dragooned out of her heritage of benignity and graciousness and kindness and courtesy by the forces of crude and ruthless ambition . When all the magnificence that today so allures , enchants and delights in the market places of the great has passed away , what remains most gratefully in the memory of posterity is , I believe , not the sight of even the most lovely and breath-taking relies in a museum , but that which a people leaves as an inheritance to the generations after it , in the way of examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gracious in the human spirit . Ireland has fought for these things . She has defended them and suffered for them over the centuries . That indomitable spirit to go out and fight for these things faltered in my generation , for a time , after ten years of bitterest struggle . It is alive again . Ireland is in arms . She will defend her ideals to the last . We appeal to America to help us to preserve them now  --  to give us courage to outwit and outlast the destructive dynasts.
