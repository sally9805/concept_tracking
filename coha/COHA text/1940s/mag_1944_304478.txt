There was no doubt about it-at 56 , cavalry-trained Colonel Harry A. Flint was overage to command infantry in battle . Yet there he was , in France , a happy dust-caked fugitive from half a dozen cushy supply and liaison jobs that were always threatening to keep him out of combat . <P> In France , as in North Africa and Sicily , " Paddy " Flint 's aging , horse-bowed legs sometimes let him down in battle . When they did he would sit down for a spell . His men knew , and they loved him for his nerve . It was soldier 's talk that " Ike " Eisenhower , a West Point plebe when the Colonel was a first-classman , had something to do with keeping Paddy up front . The arrangement suited old Paddy right down to the ground . France , beamed the ruddy Colonel , was his " graduation exercise " as a footslogger . <P> On the Saint-L-Priers road , Paddy 's outfit was held up by heavy mortar fire . Up front , as usual , the Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paddy over the walkie-talkie : " Have spotted pillbox . Will start them cooking . " <P> He called for a tank , rode atop it in a rain of fire as it sprayed the hedgerows . The tank driver was wounded . Paddy crawled down , went forward afoot . A sniper 's bullet got him as he led his patrol into the shelter of a farmhouse . <P> Aid men soon came up , loaded the Colonel on a stretcher . Said a private as they started to the rear : " Remember , Paddy , you ca n't kill an Irishman-you can only make him mad . " Colonel Flint smiled . Next day he died .
