This week , as isolationists and interventionists locked horns over the President 's lend-lease bill ( see p. 75 ) , MARCH OF TIME released as its new issue a film , Uncle Sam-the Non-Belligerent , which may put some banderillas in the bulls . <P> At any time the film would be notable as a portrait of World War II . It opens with shots of London during an air raid , shots which bring to U. S. ears the eerie sound of an air-raid alarm ( a cross between a fire-engine siren and a train whistling for a railroad crossing ) . It shows not only pictures of fires and damage in London but shots taken aboard German naval vessels at sea off Norway , of German artillery firing across the Channel , of U-boats at sea , pictures of England taken from German air raiders ( with bombs visible as they leave the plane ) , of a ship in a British convoy photographed from a Stuka diving straight down on it , of freight yards in occupied France torn up by British bombs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of French children getting rations from the conquerors , of Hitler gaily touring Paris , visiting the Madeleine , looking at the Eiffel Tower , etc . <P> The like of most of these pictures has not been seen in the U. S. , even in the few German newsreels which have been shown . <P> They are official German pictures . MARCH OF TIME got them from the Canadian Film Commissioner . The British contraband control had intercepted them on their way to German officials in South America , who were expected to show them wherever they would do the Nazis the most good . <P> Besides these unusual circumstances , the picture leaps into the middle of the heated U. S. argument between isolationists and interventionists . It shows shots of Senator Burton K. Wheeler , Representative Vito Marcantonio and ex-Editor Verne Marshall ( see col. 1 ) denouncing the President 's foreign policy , Franklin Roosevelt delivering his recent broadcast to the nation and his message to Congress , Dr. George Gallup commenting on the ballots which showed that 60% of the U. S. public favor increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Taking its tone from the fact that the majority of the U. S. favors such aid and that the U. S. appears committed in principle , if not in detail , to the President 's policy , which in effect sets up a London-Washington Axis , the picture says nothing that has not been said before . But the commentary , accompanied by pictures which lend it immense dramatic force , seems like much stronger meat than the U. S. has yet tasted . It may send shivers up the backs even of interventionists and make the hair of isolationists stand on end . Coming out the week it does , it may well be a sensation in the national debate now going on .
