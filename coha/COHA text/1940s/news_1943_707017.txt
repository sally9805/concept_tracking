txt OMAHA , Neb. , March 6 ? They could n't use Max Coffey in the Army , so he decided to do the next best thing . He quit his job as head of the newspaper 's war desk and rented an Iowa farm , where he is going to milk cows , grow coin and produce pork to feed hungry soldiers and meat-rationed civilians . But he is not feeling sacrificial about the change . Being farm bred , he has what it takes to operate , a farm and he figures the way things are now he will be doing quite as well by his family as he would in town , and feel more important to the country doing it . The way things are now is illustrated by the estimate of Iowa State College economists that the average Iowa farmer 's cash income last year was $6,500 , of which about $3,000 was net . Income increased 37 per cent , they say , while costs increased " only . 15 per cent . That was the result partly ' of higher ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even higher , now but production is an unknown quantity . Many Switch Crops Preliminary reports - on 1943 intentions represent farmers as setting their sights high . Six thousand farmers in fifty counties expect to raise more corn , soy beans and flax , breed more pigs and increase the number of cows and hens on their farms . They will I grow less wheat and oats . This is a relatively small sample and represents hopes rather than a definite and irrevocable promise . But it is indicative of the spirit animating the Corn-Belt farmer . Without knowing just how he is going to do it , he is willing to try . The big worry , of . course , is the sufficiency of labor . Apparently a large part of the extra labor that is going to be needed , especially for the emergency jobs in the harvest , will have to be recruited ? locally from volunteers more moved ? by the spirit of service than by the need of a job . A farmer was remarking the other day that the towns of the Farm Belt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vital importance . But he was somewhat skeptical of their usefulness on the farm . Farmers are inclined to be impatient with greenhorns . Results With Unskilled Still , what this kind of labor mobilization can do was illustrated in the North Platte Valley last Fall . This is an irrigated area which specializes largely in sugar beets and potatoes . When it appeared that the crop might be frozen in the ground , schools were closed in ten communities , and 1,835 students went out and worked on 3,758 jobs . . They picked up 672,779 bushels of potatoes and topped 26,246 tons of beets , besides hauling a large part of these crops . They earned $80,000 doing it . But that was only a part of the mobilization . Their teachers worked with them . Storekeepers kept open only half days and they and their help went out and worked in the beet and potato fields the other half . That kind of local self-help will probably be repeated in a good many communities this year .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
