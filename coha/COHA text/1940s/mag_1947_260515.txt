MANNERS &; MORALS <P> The furor over the new fashions rose to a fine , shrill pitch . Across the land , women by the hundreds-and city editors , too-flocked to the banners of resistance . <P> Their stronghold was Texas and their Joan of Arc was a Dallas housewife named Mrs. Bobbie Woodward . Mrs. Woodward , 24 , and mother of two , was no Ingrid Bergman . But she had a nice pair of legs and a stubborn spirit . She saw no reason why she should hide her legs under long skirts , why her draftsman husband should be put to the expense of buying her a new wardrobe , or why the women of Texas should be pushed around by a bunch of Paris and New York designers . <P> " Save Eyesfrain . " A month ago , Mrs. Woodward founded the Little Below the Knee Club and sent out a call to battle . The response was tremendous . By last week , the club had members in all the 48 states , in Canada and Alaska . In Dallas alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a war cry : " The Alamo fell , but our hemlines will not . " <P> Founder Woodward was caught up in a whirl of interviews , picture-taking , mail-opening . In the midst of it , she led an L.B.K. parade down Main Street that tied up Dallas midtown traffic for an hour and a half . Paraders carried signs saying : " Short Skirts . Save Dollars . Save Eye-strain . " Short-skirted girls chased long-skirted girls with brooms . Finally , the L.B.K.s charged up to the doors of the famed Neiman-Marcus department store . Shaking brooms and fists , they cried : " Down with the long ! Up with the short ! " <P> Nothing to Hide . At the University of California 's " veterans ' village " in Albany , a group of young wives formed the Women 's Organization to War on Styles . In a few days , the W.O.W.S. rounded up 750 members , started picketing a dress shop in bathing suits . " We Have Nothing to Hide , " said their placards , " Do We Need Padding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun , chartered the League of Broke Husbands , went picketing , too . A Georgia legislator announced that he would soon introduce a bill banning long skirts . Detroit 's street-railway boss declared that long skirts made the boarding of streetcars hazardous . <P> Despite all this todo , polls showed that , though a majority of U.S. women disliked the new styles , all but a handful planned to wear them . Oldsters recalled that there had been a furor , too , over the hobble skirt of the early 1900s and the above-the-knee skirt of the ' 20s , yet fashion had prevailed .
