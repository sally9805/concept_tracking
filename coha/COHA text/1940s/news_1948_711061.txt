txt CIVILIAN DEFENSE TO BE ESTABLISHED ON NATIONAL BASIS Forrestal to Set Up Interim Organization as Soon as He Can Find Suitable Head CONGRESS TO GET PLANS New Agency to Bar ' Fantastic ' ? Civil Board 's Report Ready as Guide to Proposals By HAROLD B. HINTON special to Tar NEW YORK Tuns . WASHINGTON , Feb. 14 ? A country-wide system of civilian defense intended to filter " the fantastic from the practical " is being sought by the National Military Establishment , Secretary of dpfense James Forrestal said today . An interim organization will be set up , he said , as soon as he can find the man to head it . Asked what he considered " fantastic " measures , Mr. Forrestal mentioned proposals to put the entire steel industry under ground . On the other hand , he said , a civilian defense agency might well consider the location of future industrial plants from the point of view of dispersion and possible shelter under the earth . The new Director of Civilian Defense , when and if he is found , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' whatever organizations he recommends to Congress . A board headed by Maj. Gen. Harold R. Bull was set up by Secretary of War Robert Patterson on Nov. 25 , 1946 , to consider the problem . Complete Report Released It took testimony and deliberated until Feb. 28 , 1947 , before making its report . By that time , unification of the armed forces was in sight , and the matter was submitted to the Navy and the Air Force for concurrence . The complete report , approved by all three services , was made public today . Secretary Forrestal 's move to set up a civilian defense organization followed the board 's recommendations . The general lines the board rec- I ommended were borrowed frankly from Great Britain , Germany and Japan . Italy , France and other belligerents in World War LE apparently were so deficient in civilian defense that they were not mentioned . The measures taken in the United States before World War II , the report said , were " inadequate to cope with a heavy attack . " The American public relied on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , ibut the board saw little reason to believe it would be right another time . In any event , the Office of Civilian Defense , it was pointed out , has been completely liquidated and there now exists no machinery in the nation to deal with such problems in the event of war . Pooling of Services Pictured The board received many requests from harassed Mayors , Governors and other local officials awed by the thought of what they would do in the event their locality were attacked by guided missiles with atomic warheads . It declined detailed advice of this sort . It drew its recommendations to include the strongly centralized authority exercised in Great Britain , the effective mobile reserves developed in Germany , and the painstaking training of the individual in self-help which was the rule in Japan . It recommended that the Fed // eral Government exercise emergency control not only from Washington but from regional headquarters . It foresaw special decentralization of authority for such congested areas as Greater New York and Chicago , where local arrangements for pooling fire , police and medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A mass of legislation , both Federal and state , would be required to bring into being the coordinated , well-knit , mutually reinforcing system which the board believed to be the only method of resisting a prolonged enemy attack on the United States . Authority would probably have , to be delegated to the Federal Government by the state and municipal authorities for the diversion , in emergency , of all available resources to a given part of the country . This could not be done , the board reasoned , unless individual communities could be assured of protection by mobile reserves in case they should be attacked while their civilian defense forces were engaged elsewhere . Complete civilian control of the entire plan was advocated , on the ground that the armed forces should be left free to perform purely military missions . The board also recommended that all subsidiary activities , such as victory gardens , bond drives , rationing , etc. , be completely divorced from the civilian defense agency , regardless of their merits . It found that the necessary training and organization of an effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency .
