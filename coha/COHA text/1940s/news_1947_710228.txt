txt When the glossy , streamlined trains running from Chicago to California cross the Kaw or the Missouri rivers , the club car stewards put away their little ounce and a half bottles of whisky . Beer and ale is replaced by a 3.2 brew . The parching traveler may slake his thirst with this or wait until he gels to Colorado or Arizona . Ile knows then he is in " dry " Kansas . In , Kansas the " dry " prefix is almost invariably in quotation marks if written . If spoken it is still there in vocal inflection . The reason is that about the only people who ca n't buy a drink in the state are travelers in club cars . Vote Dry and Drink Wet There 's an old saying in the state which has been " dry " since 1880 that a man is never more than 20 minutes from a drink in any town of more than 500 population . There 's , another that Kansans will vote dry and drink wet as long as they can stagger to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1948 when the electorate will get another chance to ' vote on repeal of the state constitution 's dry amendment . Political bookmakers wo n't give you odds either way on how this election will go . The legislature authorized the submission of the amendment by a margin of three votes in the house of representatives , tho it was backed by both parties and rushed thru be- , fore the state 's dry forces could organize . They 'll have time , before ' 48 , bUt the wets are counting on support from younger voters  --  especially ex-service men who have observed conditions in- states where liquor may be bought and sold legally . Leavenworth Wide Open Meantime , how is it in Kansas ? Suppose you stop at Leavenworth , a city of 19,000 across the river from Missouri . It has a reputation for being a " wide open " town in the old western sense . Local historians will tell you with a tinge of pride that " nobody ever has or ever will dry up Leavenworth . " The founding fathers , they say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them surveying instruments , stakes , mauls , and a barrel of whisky . Whisky has been part of the local scene since then . rtecords of the collector of internal revenue in Kansas show that Leav- ' enworth county claimed 79 retail liquor dealer federal tax stamps , since last July 1 . U. S. Gets Its Share Tho a ? strauger might consider it odd that the federal government would sell retail and wholesale tax stamps to bootleggers it 's too dangerous to do business without them , the truth is that the certificates may be purchased by any one the same as postage stamps or , for that matter , the same as the federal government will sell a stamp to be affixed to an illegal Illinois slot machine as evidence that the federal government is getting a share of the take . A peculiarity of prohibition pops up In this connection . Each stamp buyer must give the address of his place of business . Thus the Identity and headquarters of every big bootlegger in Kansas is a matter of record  --  a record which is supplied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to time in newspapers . They 're Leading Citizens Bootleggers hardly need this notoriety , however , since ordinarily they are well known in their communities as men of wealth and influence , friends of sheriffs and prosecutors , generous sources of cam ? paign funds , and rarely guests of county jailers . It is the custom of Kansas judges , influenced by the peoples ' will , they say , to admit bootleggers to parole after serving three days of a 30 day sentence . By last October Leavenworth had become such a notorious town that the federal government decided to step in and clean it up . Proceeding under the 1936 liquor enforcement act , the United States attorney indieted the mayor , police thief , and an assortment of others on charges of conspiracy to violate laws which , in effect , forbid the importation of liquor into a dry state . All Are Acquited Last month the case came to trial . Judge Arthur J. Mellott , in federal District court , directed a verdict of not guilty against the mayor and two others , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Evidence was presented that liquor had been brought in , bought and sold , protection given and paid for . The defense did not deny these charges , but Insisted that there was nothing conspiratorial about them . There is another old saying in Kansas : Juries never convict bootleggers . " If you ask why , the answer is " people would n't stand for it . " While the trial was in progress in Kansas City , Has. , this reporter visited Leavenworth . The Ir e a t was n't on . We walked into Ann 's Place on 5th st. , across from the police station . Anna Podowski , the owner , had testified the day before ins the trial that she had bought some of her stock from some of the accused bootleggers . " Can we get a drink ? " we asked hesitantly , a stranger . Anna poured a jigger of bourbon and a glass of water and asked for 40 cents . It was the same in " The Friendly Tavern " on Delaware st. ? Leavenworth 's main street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Pay Of course , there was no state tax to pay In Kansas , only a beer license to buy , and the graft , according to the trial testimony , was about $750 a month . Reasonable prices still netted a tidy profit . In Topeka things were a little different . The legislature was in ses ? Mon and the joints were pretty well closed down . However , the bellboy in our hotel offered a fifth of Old Taylor whisky for $14 . A common retail price in Illinois is $6.75 . " The price is a little higher if there 's a convention In town or a big crowd , " the bellboy said . Most of the drinking In Topeka , we discovered , Is done in homes supplied by bootleggers delivering in answer to telephone calls ; In fraternal , social , athletic , or ex-service men 's clubs , and in hotels where everybody has his own bottle and orders setups for highballs . Wichita , Kansas ' oil capital and aviation manufacturing center , is another wide open town  --  only it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open . The outskirts are rich In package stores , bars , gambling joints , and road houses . " Oasis of the West " During the war the city was the oasis of the west . Better brands of liquor disappeared in the adjoining states where they would be subject to OPA ceilings . They sold in Wichita for double the legal ceilings in stores where wares were set out on open shelves  --  available to anybody , man , woman , or child , in any quantity he could pay for . Last November federal agents , operating under the same law tested in Leavenworth , swooped down on Wichita and seized 1,000 cases of liquor in one ' day . There have been other raids since then , the legality of which has been upheld by the Supreme court . Meantime , the package stores operate in windowless , thick walled rooms with locked doors . The customer names his brand thru a slit in the wall and puts his money in a drawer which slides thru it . A few seconds later his bottle and his change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get anything you want . but you ca n't see the seller . The device also is pretty good protection against . hijackers and holdup
