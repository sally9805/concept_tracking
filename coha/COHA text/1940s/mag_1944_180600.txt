Prime Minister Winston Churchill flew back to London from Moscow last week with a promise of the world 's peace in his pocket . Two days later , in an unusually brief speech , with little Churchillian rhetoric and few high spots , he reported to an attentive Parliament the results of his conference with Joseph Stalin . Peace , like most things , had a certain price . <P> Said Prime Minister Churchill : " I am very glad to inform the House that our relations with Soviet Russia were never more close , intimate and cordial . . . . " <P> Britons , who regard Russians as rather peculiar foreigners but not sinister bogeymen , and mean every word of the 20-year Anglo-Soviet treaty , were glad to hear it , but not surprised . What they wanted to hear from Mr. Churchill was whether he had succeeded in solving the Polish problem , and on what terms . Also , what about the Balkans ? <P> Working Agreement . Reporter Churchill took up the Balkans first . Said he : Britain and Russia have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , singly and in combination . " But the nature of this agreement was specified only in the case of Yugoslavia . " We are in fact acting jointly-Russia and Britain - in our relations with both the Royal Yugoslav Government , headed by Dr. Subasich , and with Marshal Tito , and we have invited them by joint message to ... a conference between them both at Napies . " This statement could not be considered apart from the joint Churchill-Stalin statement issued from Moscow : " The right of the Yugoslav people to settle their future constitution for themselves after the war is , of course , recognized as inalienable . " In this inalienable right Marshal Tito would certainly take a decisive hand , and Tito is more responsive to Moscow than to Britain . But Russia could hardly ask for more than that King Peter 's Government should throw a royal nimbus over the Communist Marshal . <P> Urgent Adjuration . When he came to the subject of Poland , it was evident that Winston Churchill had , in effect , underwritten Russia 's Polish solution . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head the Polish Government , gave the London Poles a sharp reprimand for not having come to terms with Russia sooner . Said Churchill : " I hope Mr. Mikolajczyk will soon return to Moscow , and it will be a great disappointment to all sincere friends of Poland if a good arrangement can not be made which will enable them to form a Polish Government on Polish soil , a Government recognized by all the great powers concerned . ... If the Polish Government had taken the advice we tendered them at the beginning of this year , the additional complication produced by the formation of the Polish National Committee of Liberation at Lublin would never have arisen . ' ' <P> Well did Winston Churchill know that Premier Mikolajczyk 's return to Poland implied a split in the Polish Government in Exile . General Kasimierz Sosnkowski and other London Poles who refused to accept a Russian-dominated Poland were reported to have bought properties in Brazil , where they planned to go into permanent exile .
