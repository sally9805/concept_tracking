txt SEATTLE , Oct. ** an audible word of protest , delegates to the convention of the American Federation of Labor paved the way today to oust from its executive council George F. Browne , president of the International Alliance of Theatrical and Stage Employes , who is on trial in New York with William Bioff , charged with extorting $550,000 from four motion pieture companies . The federation 's constitution was amended to reduce the executive council membership from fifteen to thirteen . The vote was taken after the committee on law , headed by Daniel J. Tobin , president of the Brotherhood of Teamsters , recommended the amendment on the basis of a report from the executive council itself . Leaders of the A. F. of L. were not disposed to call for Mr. Browne 's resignation while he was under fire , but many delegates apparently had hoped that he would resign to save the federation from embarrassment . When he failed to resign , the council , with one vacancy resulting from the death in July of its second vice president , Thomas A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TO OUST BROWNE // Garment Workers , hit upon the idea of cutting its membership by two . Change for " Greater Efficiency " The official explanation was that since the council was enlarged from eight to fifteen members in 1934 , the year before the A. F. L.-C . I. 0 . split , experience had shown it was " more difficult to secure a quorum . " The recommendation was made , the council stated , " not for the purpose of decreasing representation of American Federation of Labor organizations upon the executive council , but instead for the 1Ipurpose of facilitating and expediting the work of the federation . ' In " full accord " with the recommendation , Mr. Tobin 's committee stated that the amendment would " result in greater efficiency . " Pointing to absence of opposition , convention leaders indicated that they expected no difficulty in electing next week a ticket on which the name of Mr. Browne would not appear . Earlier in the clay a sharp fight developed over a proposal to give unions with memberships exceeding 300,000 a per capita tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another labor split if big A. F. of L. unions continued amassing power . As approved by the committee on laws , the proposal provided that the present per capita tax of 2 cents per member per month , paid into the A. F. L. treasury by national and international unions , would be reduced to 11/2 cents on the first 300,000 members of any union and larger unions would pay only 1 cent a month for members above 300,000 . Warning on Rule of Few By an overwhelming vote the constitution was amended to give . effect to the tax concession after it was defended by Mr. Tobin , President William Green and Secretary George Meany . The opposition was led by James M. Duffy of Liverpool , Ohio , president of the National Brotherhood of Operative Potters , who objected to " placing membership on a cashand-carry basis . " Mr. Duffy , whose union has a voting strength of about one-twentyfifth that of the ' powerful Team1 sters Union , warned of a federation trend " toward a few organizations bringing to themselves tremendous I power . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industries but are reaching out on all sides to take in groups from industries in which they were not originally given jurisdiction , " he went on . " It now has got to the point where eight or ten absolutely control the whole works . " If you do nothing to stop the taking of power by a few , I predict that in five or six years you are not only going to be confronted by two separate organizations of working groups in the United States , but by a third . " In reply , Mr. Tobin pointed out that last year the teamsters ' union paid into the A. F. L. treasury nearly $100,000 , as compared with $3,200 received from the potters ' union . The teamsters , who , with the carpenters , comprise the only A. F. L. unions now having memberships larger than 300,000 , he said , were " fighting on every front in the country " against " subversive elements , not real union leaders but men with drunken , blind ambitions . " Bishop Stresses Freedoms The convention was warned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Catholic Bishop of Seattle , against extending to comnumicm " the right hand of fellowship " in connection with its expected endorsement of all-out aid to Russia as well as England in their resistance against the Nadi . He offered the convention a program embracing " three points of freedom , " which he designated as freedom of labor , freedom of ownership and freedom of elections . Only through freedom of election , he said , could racketeers be driven out of labor unions . The convention recessed this evening until Monday morning .
