" The less said about Japanese-American relations , the better . " <P> This pregnant opinion was offered in Manila last week by Japan 's new and superspecial envoy to the U.S. , Saburo Kurusu . Envoy Kurusu was speeding by Clipper to Washington , where officials were equally tight-lipped on the subject of his country and theirs . <P> That jittery , encircled , embargoed Japan proposed to follow months of Washington conversations with still more conversations was a clear sign that Japan still did not dare to follow its sword-brandishing with swordplay . Yet there was an ominous air of urgency about every move that smooth , solid , bespectacled Saburo Kurusu made . <P> He left Tokyo on two hours ' notice . Just before leaving he told his son , Sublieutenant Ryo Kurusu : " Maybe I will not be able to come back . Look after the family . " Then he took a Japanese Army plane to Portuguese Macao , motored to Hong Kong , where he caught the Clipper . <P> Landing in Manila , Saburo Kurusu was nattily equipped with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulging brief case . But the smile on his face was fabricated . At a cocktail party he drank sobering orange juice . The editor of the Tokyo Yomiuri , who shares the Japanese lust for baseball , had called him " a pinch hitter on the diplomatic diamond . " Pinch Hitter Kurusu was well aware of the pinch . <P> It was a pinch that hurt more &; more . The U.S. had steadily insisted on the freedom of the seas ( including the Pacific ) . <P> It had steadily insisted that Japan had no special status in East Asia . Between the U.S. Pacific force of arms and increasing U.S. economic pressure , Japan was being squeezed to the point of desperation . <P> Seven Silly Points . Behind Pinch Hitter Kurusu in Tokyo the Japan Times and Advertiser , which sends up trial balloons for the Foreign Office , sent up a whopper labeled the Seven Points . The U.S. , it threatened , must " face the alternatives " if the U.S. did not : 1 ) Stop aiding Chungking ; 2 ) Leave China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace ; 3 ) End Japan 's military and economic encirclement ; 4 ) Acknowledge Japan 's " co-prosperity " sphere ; 5 ) Recognize Manchukuo ; 6 ) End the freezing of Japanese and Chinese assets ; 7 ) Restore trade treaties and end restrictions on shipping and commerce . <P> More interesting than these grandiose demands was the fact that they said nothing about Japan 's Axis Pact , implying that Japan was weakening on that score . Even more significant was the fact that Japan 's new sword-brandishing Army Premier , General Hideki Tojo , had never officially mentioned Japan 's Axis alliance , nor gone beyond conveniently vague demands for a " successful " conclusion of the China Incident and for that vast vagueness , the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere . <P> Alternatives : War . If the U.S. and Japan reach no solution , what are the " alternatives " the U.S. must face ? Last week Japan appeared too witch-nervous to make up its mind . The war threats in Japan 's armory were getting rustier as time went on . English and Dutch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were U.S. naval and air preparations in the Pacific . <P> But there was one alternative which would embarrass the U.S. The Times and Advertiser stated it clearly :
