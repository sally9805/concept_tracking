Lowell Yerex had but $25 to his name when he founded TACA Airways . He built his Latin American airline into the world 's largest cargo carrier . But TACA remained a one-man show and Yerex made all the decisions . Last week it looked as if someone else had finally made a decision for tough , one-eyed Mr. Yerex . Out he went as president of TACA , the climax to a long struggle for control of the company . <P> Two years ago Yerex invited Transcontinental &; Western Air , Inc. and other U.S. investors to buy into TACA . Yerex , a New Zealander , hoped this would bring him more American planes and landing rights-in effect , make TACA a U.S. flag line . When the U.S. was slow to get behind TACA , Yerex tried dickering with the British , tried to get them to buy out the American interests . This irritated TACA 's new stockholders , chiefly TWA and Pennroad Corp. , an investment trust ; so did Yerex 's highhanded way of running things . They began to bring him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the election of Pennroad President Benjamin Franklin Pepper as chairman of TACA 's board . Then in came ex-Brigadier General Tom ( " There will be no weather " ) Hardin as executive vice president ( TIME , Nov. 12 ) . Out went Yerex 's longtime personal assistant and fellow New Zealander , Edward W. Scott . <P> The showdown came last week at a conference in Havana . TWA and Pennroad bought out Yerex 's contract as TACA president for about $100,000 , half what he would have received in the eight years the contract still had to run . In return , Yerex agreed not to operate airlines in TACA 's Latin American bailiwick for two years . He kept some $3,500,000 in TACA stock and a seat on the board of directors . <P> In TACA 's Manhattan office , bulky , genial Ben Pepper leaned back comfortably in the red leather chair once reserved for Yerex and took charge of TACA 's corporate and financial affairs . Soon a new president will be picked . Most likely candidates : Ben Pepper or Tom Hardin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sidelines ? Those who knew him well doubted it . Last week his longtime friend Ed Scott organized a Panamanian company to operate land , sea and air transportation lines .
