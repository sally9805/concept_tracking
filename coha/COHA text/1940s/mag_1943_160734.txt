The problem of incentive pay is the hottest potato in U.S. war production . It has been championed as the answer to the manpower pinch , as a shot in the arm to hop war production up as much as 30% . It has also been condemned as a backward step towards the piecework system ( particularly unpopular with automotive workers ) , the speedup , the sweatshop . <P> Last week in Detroit , where incentive pay has made snail 's progress in the onetime auto industry , C. E. Wilson , WPB 's production chief , once again pleaded for it . He begged labor not to confuse plantwide incentive pay programs with the union-hated Bedeaux plan , which " provides individual bonuses to inspire competition . " But WPBster Wilson could have made his point more graphically if he had pointed to the way one incentive pay system operates in a Detroit plant . <P> Pinochle Speed-Up . Two years ago , Detroit 's Murray Corp . ( auto frames and parts ) was having production trouble with its branch plant in Ecorse , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( schedules setting average time to complete operations ) , which actually gave some workmen so much free time that they played pinochle in washrooms . Murray got its U.A.W.-C.I.O. local to agree to new time studies by a firm of industrial engineers . To quiet union suspicions of a profit-inspired speedup , Murray did something unique in time study history : five union men were selected to take a nine-month time-study course , to help work out the new schedules . <P> Together-a Plan . Last fall , the new schedules were put into effect-along with a 4-an-hour WLB raise . The union men were given the full-time jobs of seeing the schedules worked properly . Production improved somewhat , but meanwhile the wage freeze had lowered workers ' morale . Both management and union began to think seriously about incentive pay for the Ecorse plant . ( In Murray 's main plant shifting war schedules prevent compilation of permanent time studies , make an incentive plan infeasible . ) Together , they worked out a simple , easy-to-understand system : on every plant operation , the normal production rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100% . If the group of workers on an operation exceeded 100% , wages were upped accordingly . But if they fell below , wages still remained at 100% . To keep production from becoming unbalanced , thus causing layoffs of some workers ( one danger in many incentive pay systems ) , a ceiling was arbitrarily set at 125% . Fast workers who exceeded that figure received no extra compensation . <P> To husky , roughhewn Lloyd T. Jones , onetime Kentucky minister , organizer and president of the Murray local , went the knotty job of selling suspicious workers the plan to work harder . By plugging the hard fact that their pay could increase only through the adoption of the incentive plan , Union Leader Jones got it approved for a trial period in the Ecorse plant . <P> Together-Benefits . Results were amazing . Loafing stopped . So did the pinochle . Fast workers helped slow workers , unhooked production kinks . Production rose 16% . Hourly wages , which once ranged from $1.02 to $1.10 an hour , rose with it to average $1.25 an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , other military equipment dropped .
