Cardinal Kinsley , Britain 's only Cardinal and the Archbishop of Westminster , died last winter ( TIME , March 29 ) . Last week Pope Pius XII appointed his successor : 44-year-old Monsignor Bernard Griffin , Auxiliary ( assistant ) Bishop of Birmingham . The little-known prelate will be the leader of England 's and Wales 's 2,400,000 Roman Catholics . The appointment was also tantamount to telling Mgr . Griffin that he will some day get a Cardinal 's red hat . <P> In naming Griffin , who has been a Bishop only five years , His Holiness skipped over 19 other prelates . The Pope was looking ahead : like the Anglican Church 's leader , William Temple , Archbishop of Canterbury , Mgr . Griffin is a liberal on social questions . A leader in the progressive Catholic Social Guild , he has backed Sir William Henry Beveridge 's postwar Social Security plan : " We need it . We want to get it going as soon as possible . " <P> Son of a Birmingham carpenter who became city councillor and justice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naval Air Service in World War I , later became a priest . He was educated in England and Rome . His outstanding work in smoky Birmingham has been guiding the Father Hudson Homes for Children , one of Britain 's largest orphanages . Birmingham folk also know the wiry , redheaded clergyman for his street preaching . For years he went every Saturday night to the " Bull Ring " ( Birmingham 's Hyde Park ) , where he sturdily traded verbal punches with hecklers.
