As quietly as if he were getting up to stretch his legs , Prime Minister Mackenzie King rose in the House , announced a definite program on an important question-what his Government intends to do about its Japs : <P> There will be absolutely no more immigration from Japan . This is a desirable policy , said Mr. King , although it should not be stated as binding for all time to come . <P> A special commission will determine which Japs have been loyal to Canada and which Japs disloyal . The disloyal Japs , citizens or not , will be deported to Japan , whether born there or not . The loyal Japs will be treated justly . " No person of Japanese origin , " the Prime Minister remarked , " born in Canada , has yet been charged with any act of sabotage or disloyalty . " <P> Before war 's start , 22,096 of Canada 's 23,149 Japs lived in British Columbia . Such concentration , said Mr. King , will not be permitted again . " The Japs will have to settle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not present themselves as an unassimilable bloc . . . . " <P> The policy would not wholly satisfy British Columbia extremists , who want all Japs-citizens and aliens , loyal and disloyal-expelled . Neither would it wholly please those who urge equal rights for all races . Great Compromiser King had stuck to middle ground . But at least he had a stated policy . That was something the U.S. still lacked . <P> Some 2,000 Japs who had been evacuated to Alberta from British Columbia after war 's start had a unique experience this week . In British Columbia they had never been permitted to vote . But since they had met all voting requirements ( citizenship , a year 's residence in the Province , etc. ) , they could vote in Alberta 's Provincial election .
