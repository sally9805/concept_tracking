At almost exactly the same instant on the sleek turf courts of the Sea Bright Lawn Tennis &; Cricket Club in New Jersey , two different linesmen , on two different courts , cried " Out ! " Both balls were hit on match points . One was struck by Don McNeill , national champion , ranked No. 1 by virtue of his victory in the singles on Forest Hills grass courts last year ; the other by Frank Parker , national clay court champion , who has won eight of the nine hard-court tournaments he has played in this year . <P> McNeill , who has won not a single tournament this year , has had a wretched season-about the worst for a No. 1 ranker since John Hope Doeg 's memorable fadeout ten years ago . His game is more effective on grass than on clay , and he has been playing on clay . But his shots had been going badly and his confidence was shaken . He had no alibi last week . Parker , onetime protege of Coach Mercer Beasley , who comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an alibi . He likes clay better than turf ; his mechanical style thrives on a higher bounce than he gets from grass . <P> Meanwhile , without attracting much attention , a compact , snaggle-toothed young man of 23 knocked over opponents like straw men , moved down to the finals with the loss of only one set . Bobby Riggs , ranked No. 2 , had thrice won the Sea Bright Tournament , the first major grass-court tournament of the season . Bobby felt fine this year . His weight was up five pounds ( to 140 ) and he had found out how to relax in the middle of a match without lowering his game . Tennis fans consider him the smartest , nearest thing to a veteran in the present crop of headliners . He does n't hit very hard , but he hits for the openings . He has a fine , quick wrist that enables him to mask the direction of a shot until the last moment . <P> In the final Riggs met the man who beat McNeill-Ted Schroeder , National Doubles champion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schroeder , who a few years ago was good for a kid , is now much better than that . He plays a hard-driving game that will take him further than he has come . In his match with Riggs he was a slugger against a boxer . Schroeder seemed to be still tired from his match the day before with Wayne Sabin , the man who beat Parker . <P> In the final Schroeder 's stuff often left Riggs flatfooted , but Riggs ran Schroeder ragged . At the end of two sets , both of which he lost by 6-4 , Schroeder was done in . In the last set he did not win a game . Bobby Riggs became the first man in tennis history to win four Sea Bright tournaments . <P> When the tournament was getting under way Riggs had said : " The man who wins at Sea Bright will win at Forest Hills . " After it he saw no reason to change his chipper mind .                  @ @ @
