Does your adolescent daughter have an almost unnatural affection for some member of her own sex ? for her scout leader , or the new librarian , or even the girl who sits ahead of her in Junior High ? Is your child 's adoration of this person becoming exaggerated ? Are you beginning to worry about it ? If such is the case ? and such is often the case with girls in their early teens ? you will be interested to know what psychiatrists have to say about schoolgirl crushes . Interested , and relieved . For a psychiatrist will tell you that in adolescence a crush is perfectly normal . That it does n't always happen , but is to be expected . That what to do about it is very little . A psychiatrist defines a crush as " a natural development in an in-29 dividual 's effort to make new relationships . " He groups crushes informally under three general headings ? the idol type , the confidante type , and the attraction-ofopposites type . For the first type of crush , schoolteachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adolescent girl 's logical targets . The girl may hover close to her idol or worship from afar , according to the circumstances . In either case , she copies her idol 's walk , dress , mannerisms , opinions , and hairdo as best she can . She treasures each word the idol speaks , each object the idol touches . Both awake and asleep , she dreams of growing up to be exactly like her . The second type is the attachment of an adolescent girl for another girl of her own age ? a girl who is more or less her equal . Giggling and whispering and the exchange of secrets and of valued possessions characterize this crush ; also letter writing , possibly in private code . Each girl tries to shine in the other 's eyes , though not to surpass her . Both tend to exclude all other close friendships for the duration of the crush . The third type is the attachment of one girl to another who is conspicuously her opposite ? the attachment of a very pretty girl to a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ; of a prim girl to a hoyden ; of a nicely brought up girl to a girl who may not be actually delinquent but certainly knows more than is good for her . It is this crush , when it occurs , that makes dismayed mothers exclaim : " What can my child see in her ? I ca n't understand it ! What causes these crushes anyhow ? " Nature causes them , says the psychiatrist . Crushes are as much a part of adolescence as spotty complexions , and , like the spots , are reasonably certain to disappear . In adolescence the child first begins to break away from the family and become an independent individual . She knows instinctively that she can not stay , protected , inside the family circle forever , that she must enlarge her world , shift the feelings she has for members of her family to individuals outside . That now is the time to begin . But just look at your darling daughter . Unorganized , insecure , and gawky . Bands on her teeth , inferiority in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that she must win friends and influence people , go to parties , get married eventually . The idea makes her shriek with laughter . Then it makes her want  | to sink right through the floor and disappear . You know her personality will tell someday ; but she does n't know it . And she ca n't talk to you very easily about the things that are getting her down . Why ? Because this is the stage in which she is trying to break away from her parents . It is typical of this phase , the 1 psychiatrist says , that in her effort to break away the child goes too far in the opposite direction and rejects her parents entirely for the time being . She becomes hypercritical of them , wants to be as unlike them as possible . She decides they are old hat or dull or too severe . and that she is probably really an adopted child anyway ( preferably of royal or gypsy blood ) . Yet she desperately needs help at this stage in her life . Perhaps she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person who is all she dreams of becoming herself and all she so depressingly is not . In that case an idol crush may develop . Or perhaps she wants the con ) - , forting assurance that she is not facing the grown-up world alone , that another girl shares her yearnings and her bursts of shaky joy . That is the foundation for j the confidante crush . Or perhaps she wants to build up her faltering ego by feeling superior to , or even protective toward , another person . In that ease the result is likely to be a crush of the third kind , based on the attraction o : opposites . W HATEVER the crush , the psychiatrist says . it is normal for it to occur . It is also normal for it to end . Parents : interference may prolong it ; so try to be tolerant . Do n't criticize the idol . make fun of the confidante , or snub the girl you disapprove of . If you do . your daughter will cling to her all the more . Encourage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other girls . Suggest indirectly that to play with the other girls might be fun , too . Given half a chance . the child will work the crush out by herself . How well and how quickly she works it out depends largely on you . Ask yourself honestly why you object to the crush . Is it really objectionable ? Or are you simply unwilling to give up your own place as the center of your daughter 's universe ? If it is really objectionable , try to discover why your daughter has formed this particular attachment . The chances are that it springs from some cause you can correct . If your daughter has chosen a bosom friend who is obviously her inferior , for instance , she is simply showing you that you have failed to give her enough attention , that she is so insecure she has to feel superior to someone , even a girl with whom nobody else wants to be seen . In that case , your job is to start giving your daughter as much unobtrusive attention as you possibly can . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Parents , psychiatrists say , should make it plain that they are ready , willing , and able to discuss anything under the sun their children want to discuss . They should find out what the child 's worries are and tactfully put them to rest .  | Some of these worries will be apparent . " What makes me so clumsy ? " " What shall I talk to the boys about ? " " What if no one dances with me ? " A mother can talk to her daughter about those things without being asked . Other worries may go deeper ; but they are fairly trivial , even so . Make it plain to your daughter that she is not different from other girls , that the things she is experiencing are simply a part of growing up , and that everybody has been through them . In certain rare cases actually abnormal attachments may be formed ? usually in later years . This article does not pretend to cover such cases . When they occur , the parent should consult the family doctor or explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , however , you need not worry about such eventualities . Nor , if you establish a basic understanding between your daughter and yourself , have you anything to fear from any passing schoolgirl crush .  |
