In Washington last week , a U.S. mission , sent to Japan to study the action and effects of The Bomb , was still mulling over the evidence . Many facts remained secret , but those released gave the U.S. people a heart-stopping preview of atomic war . <P> For the first time , the U.S. people had some exact , scientific facts on what happened when The Bomb dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki . At about 1,800 feet above ground ( Japanese figure ) , it turned into a blue-white ball of energy as bright as a thousand suns . Its initial temperature , if known , has not been told . ( The figure , reading in millions or hundreds of millions of degrees , would be meaningless except to physicists . ) <P> Out of that searing ball came a trip-hammer sequence of blows . First to reach he ground was the radiant heat , which moved with the speed of light ( 186,000 miles a second ) . Half a mile away , the heat set clothing and other light , inflammable substances instantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones . Many a Japanese was branded in stripes from the pattern on his shirt . The gay , flowered designs on the dresses of Japanese women were stenciled in charred exactitude upon their bodies . A mile and a half from the bomb , the flash of heat was strong enough to blister the ace or set a forest afire . <P> Shock &; Blast . Next came the shock wave , essentially a sound wave and moving with the speed of sound . Close on its heels came a shattering blast of air displaced by The Bomb 's expanding gases . The shock wave claimed its victims by squeezing their bodies , compressing their internal organs , puncturing their lungs . When the vacuum which followed it reached them , the gas in their stomachs and intestines expanded explosively , rupturing the tissues . Then came the blast , at 500 to 1,000 miles per hour , sweeping them over the ground , along with the churned-up rubble and blazing wood . At first , the blast was as hot as a flame . Even at 4,200 feet from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of the 1926 Miami hurricane . <P> Light buildings were houses of cards for the heat and blast ; they were burned up or swept away . Most factories collapsed completely . At Nagasaki , the heavy-brick Roman Catholic Church fell into rubble . <P> Gamma Rays . In both Hiroshima and Nagasaki a few modern buildings of heavy reinforced concrete stood up through the clean-swept desolation . Some military conservatives have pointed to them as proof that only flimsily built Japanese cities need fear atomic bombs . <P> Such optimism , said members of the mission , was not justified . On the inside , the surviving buildings were empty shells . Even when the fire had not burned them out , the blast had punched through the doors and windows , churning the interiors into hopeless ruin . Example : from a distance , the Nagasaki Medical School looked almost untouched ; inside , it was a wreck . <P> In both stricken cities a few Japanese under shelter survived the heat and blast , only to die later from the invisible gamma rays . Striking through thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raging infections to spread through their bodies ( TIME . Feb. 4 ) .
