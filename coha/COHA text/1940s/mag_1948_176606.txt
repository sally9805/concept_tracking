For some 200 years , Lloyd 's of London had known every day of the Empire 's growth-every new wharf , every skirmish , every treaty . One night last week , Lloyd 's , like a rich aunt with the children home from school , threw open its doors for a party Disraeli would have loved : for 2,400 guests , 2,400 bottles of champagne , and , to soften the glitter of the great marble halls , 1,400 worth of flowers . The London Evening Standard glowed : " Diamonds , champagne , beautiful women in lovely gowns , men wearing dazzling displays of honors and medals . There is no doubt that last night 's party was the most generous since the war . " <P> Guests of honor were the Prime Ministers ( or their deputies ) of seven Dominions* of the British Commonwealth come to London to consult-but not to decide . On many issues they would have found decision difficult . Those issues were deliberately put aside , or touched upon lightly . <P> A Change of Attire . Over the smiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Just what is this new Commonwealth ? Not the old one , that was sure . Most prominent and respected man at the London conference last week was Jawaharlal Nehru , who had spent 14 years of his life in British jails ; for this he held no grudge against Britain , but for his lifelong struggle he certainly had no repentance . Nehru , on arriving in London , changed his long black sherwani for a Savile Row suit . He looked well in a Homburg hat . <P> But was it as easy as that ? Nehru , Westernized leader of an un-Westernized nation , stood for a bewildering new fact : the vast majority of the people of the British Dominions do not speak English , have only partial contact with British institutions and are not deeply touched by what Winston Churchill has called " unity within the mysterious circle of the Crown . " <P> The sovereign Dominions were not formally bound to act together . In 1911 , every one of " the old Dominions " ( and the mother country ) had rejected a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations . Their union rested on like-mindedness , on " kingship and kinship , " on a common heritage and a common way of doing things . It rested also-very heavily-on British control of the seas and London 's central position in world commerce-of which Lloyd 's was a symbol . These had been the central political and economic facts of the preceding century . <P> Now that India , Pakistan and Ceylon were full dominions , now that Britain 's primacy in sea power and trade had departed , now that South Africa was heading down an undemocratic , anti-British road ( see below ) , what was left of the easy trust and informal cooperation of the old Commonwealth ?
