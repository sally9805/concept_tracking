Navy records call her PC-487 . Navy men call her " The Little Fellow , " and say it with affectionate pride . Like dozens of her sisters who do the monotonous patrol work of the war at sea . PC-487 is a modest , unspectacular little warship , about 170 ft. long , of 600 tons displacement . Her commander is a reserve lieutenant , chubby , ruddy W. Gordon Cornell , a Staten Islander . <P> On a medium foggy morning , somewhere in the Pacific , PC-487 was dutifully sheep-dogging along on the outskirts of a convoy . Her sound detectors picked up a strange craft and she headed for that spot . <P> At 250 yd. her lookouts spotted a submarine 's twin periscopes sticking up . Skipper Cornell ordered a depth-charge attack . One charge exploded close to the hull , forcing the Jap to the surface . The Little Fellow heeled around sharply in a 180-degree turn , churned up to 19 knots and rammerd the sub amidships . <P> The sub rolled , her conning tower awash . Machine gunners on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craft . The forward deck gun crew got off one round-a direct hit on the conning tower-as the 487 circled to ram again . Now the submarine was almost entirely on the surface . The Little Fellow crashed into the Jap just forward of the conning tower , rolling the sub over . A wavering periscope scraped the side of the 487 's hull , broke a stanchion on deck and came within an inch of decapitating Skipper Cornell . <P> " The 487 seemed to stick and pivot on top of the submarine , and felt as though it would break in two , " he reported . " But the ship finally slid over . " <P> Now the afterdeck gun crew got into action , pumping five shells into the sub . The Jap 's bow rose in the air , hung for a moment , then the enemy vessel plunged beneath the surface , stern first , at a 45-degree angle . Fifteen minutes after she had been sighted , the sub was one of the most definite kills of the war . The Little Fellow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a thundering welcome of cheers and whistle blasts .
