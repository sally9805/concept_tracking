Every evening at 7 , last week , the 1,810,076 members of the United Lutheran Church in America were asked to " pray . for the press . " The prayer : that " all who gather and publish the news . . . may discharge their trust in the interest of godliness and good order . " <P> " That 's O.K. by us , " grinned New York 's irreverent tabloid Daily News , and suggested a postscript to the prayer : <P> " P.S.-And oh , Lord , please do n't let any American newspaper people ever forget the statement of Wilbur F. Storey , setting forth the aims of the old Chicago Times in 1861 : ' It is a newspaper 's duty to print the news , and raise hell . ' Amen . "
