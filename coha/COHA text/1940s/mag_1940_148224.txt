Last week a hardy old chestnut , still to be cracked , was picked over for the umpteenth time . Picker was Dr. Nolan Don Carpentier Lewis , head of the New York State Psychiatric Institute in Manhattan . " I 'm not interested in normal people , " said bluff Dr. Lewis to a group of normal laymen . All great works in the world , said he , are the doings of neurotics , and if a psychiatrist wants to do his bit for civi lization , he should remember that men of talent must stay neurotic . <P> " A very famous woman novelist , " con tinued Dr. Lewis , " came to consult me not long ago about her neurosis . I recognized her trouble and told her I could cure her but she would no longer write novels if I did . She , of course , desired treatment , but I decided that it would be a pity to destroy a fine novelist and so I refused to cure her and so she is continuing to write fine novels . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be treated for his trouble . I warned him that I could cure him but that he might never play the piano again . He begged me to go ahead . . . . Well , I have cured him but he is no longer a great artist of the piano . He is now a fine mathematician . " Similarly , he said , a " cured painter " became a well-known photographer . <P> " It is true , " concluded Dr. Lewis , " that we know that neuroses produce works of genius , but we do not know yet how to produce these neuroses artificially , nor how to direct them and so create geniuses or works of genius . " <P> On the opposite side of the chestnut stand is Dr. Abraham Arden Brill , great friend of Dr. Lewis and dean of the orthodox Freudian psychoanalysts . " I have analyzed many novelists and artists , " said he last week , " and they have produced their greatest works after treatment . " <P> Still puzzled by this eternal dispute are historically minded laymen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family man like Einstein or Darwin , a sunny soul like Spinoza , an Olympian spirit like Goethe . They can complain , and do , that psychiatrists have never made clear the difference , if any , between scientific and artistic talent . Nor have the doctors explained whether a neurotic is : 1 ) a long-fingered person of " artistic temperament " ; 2 ) a crank who looks under the bed every night or constantly washes his hands ; or 3 ) a robust grappler with convention .
