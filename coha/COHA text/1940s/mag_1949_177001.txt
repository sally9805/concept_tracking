To the editors of Hearst 's San Francisco Examiner , the beefy , flashily dressed stranger introduced himself as Bob Patterson , an all-round newshand . He 'd just breezed in from Atlanta , he said , via Hollywood , where he had written Brute Force for Mark Hellinger . He wanted a job . <P> In March 1946 , he got the job-writing the new society chitchat and gossip column that W.R. Hearst had ordered . As " Freddie Francisco , " Patterson filled his column with racy penthouse scandal and jive talk , was soon earning $15,000 a year as the Examiner 's prize drawing card . Once , when he called a lady Oakland evangelist " sexy-looking , " her congregation picketed the Examiner . A great gagster , Freddie rented a beard and paraded with the pickets . He also crusaded against Elmer ( " Bones " ) Remmer , owner of San Francisco 's three biggest gambling houses , and drove Bones out of business . ( When offered a $500-a-month bribe to lay off , he hid a microphone and got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <P> One day last month , Freddie 's column casually mentioned an obscure and unappetizing Los Angeles weekly called Hollywood Nite Life . It was nothing but a " brash , often spiteful publication , " he wrote , and its swart and droopy-lidded publisher , one Jimmy Tarantino , struck him as a man who liked to toot his own horn . <P> Last week Tarantino struck back . Shipping thousands of extra copies of Nite Life into the Bay area , he gave San Franciscans a shocking story under a black , front-page headline : FREDDIE **25;642;TOOLONG . Who was Freddie Francisco ? Why , said Tarantino , he was a man of eight aliases , with a 20-year criminal record studded with seven arrests ( forgery , robbery , grand larceny , theft of Government property ) and four convictions for theft , forgery , and fraud . A four-time loser , he was on parole from the federal prison at Atlanta , and was an " accomplished shakedown artist . " What was Hearst going to do about him ? <P> For five days , nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story , while Freddie ( real name Robert Lawson Preston , 44 ) tried to bluster it through . " Some of it 's true , " Preston conceded airily , " and some of it is n't . " <P> Actually , Nite Life had the cold dope on Freddie . Like other newsmen , Examiner Managing Editor William C. Wren had known for two years about his columnist 's record , but he had not been disturbed . But at week 's end , the column vanished from the Examiner . The order to fire Freddie Francisco , said Hearstlings , came from the Chief himself .
