For the first time since autumn 1939 , advertising pages of U.S. magazines bloomed last week with the blue , white &; red flag of France above a famed name-French Line . Once one of the proudest of all shippers , employing 50,000 , linking a hundred ports , beloved by Americans for its luxury liners and fabulous food , the 89-year-old line and her famed Pier 57 were household names . <P> World War II set her 79 ships to carrying munitions for the French Government .
