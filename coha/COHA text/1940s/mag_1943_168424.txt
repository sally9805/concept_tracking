Hackettston , Conn. , where they lived with 9,174 other people much like themselves , was a quiet , ordinary , clean and well-kept town . George Peterson , who married Helen , was a solid businessman who flushed uncomfortably when he admitted his philosophy of life : " It 's worth something just to hear the machines going till 5 o'clock again . " <P> They were better people than they knew they were . Hackettston was a better place than its citizens understood . They did not know that their lives were exciting . <P> Readers of The Walsh Girls may feel that Mrs. Janeway does not know it .

The book is unique among U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character . So carefully does the author outline each feature in her pictures of Helen , George and Lydia that the book takes on the quality of a preserved family parlor with portraits by Sargent on the walls . <P> Surf in Her Head . The best feature of The Walsh Girls is its superb characterization of Lydia . Reaching her 40th birthday in the summer of 1935 , teacher of high-school English to classes that were now filled with the children of her old school mates , neat , precise , churchgoing , independent , heartbreakingly lonely , she lived alone in the mansion she inherited , an exemplification of the remoteness of the culture she taught from the stirring life around her . Each morning she put on her black hat with a feather on it , her scarf , galoshes , sweater and coat , and went to her class . She earned her $2,100 a year . At night , after she had graded papers , she cooked a chop and potatoes , carried her supper into the big empty dining room , lit the chandelier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she ate , " the flowing sentences combing out her thoughts , resting her mind as delicously as if the sea swept rhythmically through her head . " <P> $68.03 in the Bank . When George and Helen returned from their Florida honey moon , Lydia was trying to remember that the mortgage was due on the old Walsh home . She sat at her desk by the window and wrote down , " Bank account : $68.03 . " The Brazilian bonds she had bought for $3,600 were now worth $313.64 . She owed two quarters payment on the principal , plus $150 and interest : at least $750 . She talked stiffly to the banker , whose bank had recently passed quietly into the hands of a Boston firm , to her new brother-in-law , who had spent more than he could afford on his honeymoon and whose factory now employed 126 people where it had employed 432 in good times . Then she gave up , sold the house furnishings for $383 , packed her trunk and moved in with Helen and George .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
