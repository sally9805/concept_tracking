Left to carry on with one clerk , one telephone operator , was Charge d'Affaires Robert M. McClintock . Left to stew and wonder was Finland-at war with the Russians , bludgeoned by Germany , and now roundly rebuked by the U.S. <P> Just what brought on the rebuke , the State Department did not say . But it was the latest in a long series of indications that the U.S. Government was fed up with Finland 's role as a Nazi ally , and with Finland 's submission to tightening German control . Last July , the U.S. closed its consulates in Finland . In December , Minister H. F. Arthur Schoenfeld left for Washington , ostensibly to report . Soon afterward , the Finnish Information Service in the U.S. was suspended by U.S. order . Recently Minister Schoenfeld , while retaining his title , has assisted Herbert H. Lehman in the Office of Foreign Relief and Rehabilitation . <P> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or an escape from Axis domination , the Finns knew what to fear next .
