In the hunting lodge at Marly-le-Roi , 16 miles from Paris , former President Charles de Gaulle cloaked himself in complete reticence . The Government cloaked his residence with watchful police , who did not interfere with the General 's liberty but checked every one of his visitors . <P> What did le grand Charlie think of all this ? " Silent as the Sphinx , " reported the weekly Le Clou , " De Gaulle amuses himself with the subtle game of enigmas . " Rumor whirled among left-wingers of an impending rightist coup . " De Gaulle 's intransigent friends , " said Le Clou , " dream for their Idol a destiny either like a return from the island of Elba or one resulting from a big scuffle . . . . <P> " Because of these rumors , which have reached official ears , De Gaulle is ' protected ' by his successors . One might as well write that he is under house arrest . "                  @ @ @
