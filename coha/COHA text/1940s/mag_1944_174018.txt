The first U.S. voluntary hospital+ to take both white and Negro physicians has succeeded " beyond expectation . ' ' This announcement about Harlem 's Sydenham Hospital was made last week by Trustee Harry C. Oppenheimer . <P> When Sydenham began in a Harlem brownstone house in 1892 , most of its ward patients were ( as they still are ) Negroes . But , like the rest of New York City 's voluntary hospitals , Sydenham took no Negro doctors . Twenty years ago , the hospital moved to a fine new 200-bed building . White patients filled the private and semiprivate rooms . The utility staff was mixed , and there were a few Negro nurses . The staff doctors were all white . <P> The only hospitals in New York City where Negro doctors could practice were the free public hospitals , where all patients were ward patients . There was , in short , no hospital where a Negro doctor could send a private patient and continue to treat him . For sick Negroes , going to the hospital meant going to a ward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the banning of Negro doctors from the great voluntary teaching hospitals seriously cut a Negro 's chances of getting good training . At least part of Harlem 's high mortality rate ( 36% above the rest of the city in 1943 ) could be blamed on the shortage of good Negro doctors . <P> To Do What They Could . Last December , Sydenham 's trustees finally decided to do what they could , voted to accept Negroes on the medical staff , added several Negro trustees . When the staff was told of the move , two nurses and three other workers quit . But the white doctors held fast . Last February , Negro doctors began work , Negro patients began to filter into private rooms ( 10-20% ) and semiprivate ( 25% ) . The hospital 's management , worried about mixing races in semiprivate rooms , still asks each patient whether he objects ; so far none has balked . <P> At present , 23 of Sydenham 's staff of some 300 doctors are Negroes . Famed Negro Surgeon Peter Marshall Murray , an attending physician on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of the twelve interns , two are Negroes . About 60% of the nurses are Negroes , and there are a few Negro nurse 's aides . The hospital 's Negro backers hope the proportion of Negroes does not get too high-Sydenham might become known as a Negro hospital , and the whole experiment of interracial hospitalization would be defeated .
