In spite of generations of experience and all the thousands of case histories , cancer research has advanced at a turtle 's pace . Doctors acknowledge the basic truisms that cancer is cell growth gone wild , that cases discovered early can sometimes be cured through X ray , surgery , radioactive substances . But beyond that , chains of ignorance still bind their hands . <P> This week at the University of Minnesota , two top-level professors-Dr . Robert G. Green , expert in bacteriology and immunology , and Dr. John J. Bittner , geneticist and cancer biologist-nailed up an important signpost in medicine 's fight against cancer . They reported that they had discovered : 1 ) a filterable virus which definitely causes breast cancer in mice ; 2 ) an anti-cancer serum which kills the mouse cancer cells , in test tubes . <P> Their inquiry was begun ten years ago by Dr. Bittner at the Jackson Memorial Laboratory , Bar Harbor , Me . There Dr. Bittner discovered that a cancerous agent , which he called a milk factor , could be transmitted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now believes that the milk factor is a virus , fitting a virus ' classic descriptions : 1 ) it grows only in living cells ; 2 ) it is too small to be seen through a microscope ; 3 ) when it is injected into animal tissues , immune agents are formed by the combination . <P> The White Powder . Working over four years with 104,275 mice , Drs . Green &; Bittner developed a breed in which the cancer strain was particularly high . Bits of cancer tissue from infected high-strain mice were sliced , put in gravity-defying centrifuges . The materials thus separated from malignant cancer cells were put back in the centrifuge for a second whirl . What was left was a whitish , dustlike powder-grim carrier of the virus . <P> Rabbits and mice were then infected with a solution of the powder . Mice contracted cancer ; rabbits did not . Antibodies , or immune agents , formed in the rabbits ' bloodstreams , overpowered the virus , produced the serum used to neutralize the cancer virus in test tubes . <P> Conclusions reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more closely linked with the cancer problem ; virus-infected cancer cells are entirely foreign to normal mouse cells ; anti-cancer agents in the serum cause no damage to normal cells . <P> Bespectacled Researcher Green , said to have been the inspiration for Sinclair Lewis ' Arrowsmith , works late in his basement laboratory with Dr. Bittner . The virus has been named the " Bittner Virus , " in recognition of his discovery of the milk factor . <P> While their double-barreled discovery is unquestionably one more forward step in cancer research , Drs . Green &; Bittner carefully point out that heredity , hormone influences and nutrition are still known to be factors in the appearance of cancer . But the relatively unexplored field of virus influence in mammary cancer has now been opened .
