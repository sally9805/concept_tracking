It was wonderful while it lasted : 8,500,000 Americans had tasted the hospitality of the 52-20 club . In effect , the 52-20 club was a kind of caboose on the G.I. gravy train . Under its provisions , every unemployed World War II veteran was entitled to $20 a week until he found a job-for a maximum of 52 weeks . Veterans who were self-employed but found the going skimpy could draw enough to assure themselves an income of $100 a month . <P> This week , after costing taxpayers $3,700,000,000 , the 52-20 club lost its charter . Harry Truman and many governors-who did not want to dip into their state 's own unemployment compensation funds-wanted 52-20 continued . But Congress failed to act before the law expired .
