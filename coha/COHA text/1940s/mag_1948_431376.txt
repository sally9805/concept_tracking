 | Mr. Blandings Goes to Hollywood Condensed from Life Eric Hodgins EVERYONE told me it would be terrible , and I believed everything they said . The movies had bought my hook , Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House , * and it was in my contract that I would spend a number of weeks in Hollywood . " Since nobody will pay any attention to you , " said one of my best and wisest friends , " take along your notes on your next novel and work on that . Hollywood is ? " He then told me what Hollywood was . I had heard it before . I admit there is nothing like a stranger 's first contact with the Los Angeles Extended Area Telephone Directory to make a man feel that he is friendless in an old Czechoslovakian customs house with a hangover . But I finally reached my agent ( whom I had never met ) and was directed to his house . There I had my first surprise : He was gentle , genial and humorous ? not at all the flesh-peddling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my status out here ? " I asked him . " The lowest of the low , " he said , suspiciously quickly . " There is a great veneration for Books here , but this almost never includes their authors . You , as a small example , have written a book which is fairly well known , but nobody has ever heard of you . Your best asset is the people you are going to work with . Have you met them ? " I said that Norman Panama and Melvin Frank were known to me only as names and " co-producers " of Mr. Blandings . " They 're young and hard-working and conscientious , " said my agent . " And they do not think they  | are geniuses , which is a very good omen . Are there any other questions you wish to ask ? " " Am I on the payroll ? " I inquired with simple dignity . " I 'll doublecheck that , " said my friend . " You were yesterday . " " I was n't here yesterday , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said my friend , his eyes like slits . The next day dawned splendid and foggy . The taxi ride from my hotel to the studio was brief ? no more than 35 minutes . The driver , noting my foreign ' appearance ? gray hat , somber , heavy clothes ? threw out a feeler : " You from the East ? " I said I was . " I am too , " he said . This had all the fascination of finding an old girl friend pounding laundry on the banks of the Irrawaddy , so I kept the conversation going by asking , " Where from ? " He said , " Omaha . Where you from ? " I told him New York , and his conviviality faded . " Oh , " he said , hunting for a way to relieve the awkwardness , " the Far East . " We spent the rest of the trip in silence . " Your name is on The List , " said the keeper of the front door , meaning that he had been instructed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the office of the Messrs . Panama and Frank . We were introduced and spent the first five minutes asking each other how we were . It turned out we were all fine . Finally Panama or Frank dredged up a question fraught with chaos : " What would you like to do here ? " I did not know . I thought they knew . They thought I knew . In half an hour we had worked out a plan . They had about half of their first preliminary script down on paper . Why should n't I write a critique of it ? Discussing their 8o-page half-script , I wrote 20 pages of comments , wise beyond my years . Panama and Frank were quite undisturbed . " You have one or two good points here , " they said . " You do n't seem to like Scene 39 . " I said I did n't . " Well , " said they , " we do n't either . So why do n't you write it and we 'll criticize . " My last attempt at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successive revisions of Scene 39 . Finally I discovered that I was mostly recopying what Panama and Frank had written in the first place . For the benefit of the moviegoing public , however , I might say that Scene 39 does not appear in Mr. Blandings at all , in anybody 's version . Gradually the fall came and with it the beginning of shooting from a script that by now was a mosaic of compromises . No man 's ideas had dominated ? certainly not those of Dore Schary , the Official Last-Word Man , nor those of the director , H. C. Potter . The assistant director for Mr. Blandings was a young man named Jimmy Lane . Here is the sort of thing with which he and his associates had to contend :  | The plot of the picture requires that an old house , bought by the Blandings for its antique charm and value , be torn down . This happens in front of the camera . The Blandings ' Dream House must then be built on the identical spot . The plot also calls for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dream House will stand . Could excavation be made and house be built on the same location in natural sequence ? No . That would involve days of dead time for the high-priced cast . So another location had to be found , in which two thirds of all structures , trees , fences had to be completely duplicated . The task of creating rural Connecticut in California 's wholly dissimilar San Fernando Valley was no cinch to begin with , since the majestic oaks were bolted together and their leaves wired on , and they clanked when struck . To do this work twice , and to find a new location with background and topography enough like , the original so that the Special Effects Department could make them seem identical , seemed an incredible labor . But it was done . The two locations appear as one on the screen , but it took weeks of thought and management to produce an effect for which the sole demand was that the audience would not notice any effect whatever . Because of the weather every exterior set must have its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interior to protect the schedule and keep shooting in progress even if there is fog or rain outside . Dollars pour out by the second while shooting progresses , and everyone feels this hard pressure from topmost stars down . By my back-of-the-envelope estimates , the running expenses on Blandings were something like $37,000 a shooting day . There was one huge set , built at great expense , for which the camera had to be set on staging 25 feet above the floor . Cary Grant and Myrna Loy had the job of acting on an inclined plane ( with no guard rail ) some 6o feet above hard concrete and were in position just as I walked nervously into the studio . Grant spotted me and yelled , " Show Hodgins how it looks in the camera . " It must have taken me at least three minutes to climb the ladder , have my look in the camera and climb down again . I made the mental calculation that my look had cost the studio $550 . Yet in another sense maybe my look did n't cost anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching the shooting of a scene depicting the breakfast nook of the Blandings ' New York City apartment . It went wrong seven times in a row . The scene was first flagged to halt by the sound man for that most frequent of reasons ? microphones picking up the mutter of airplane engines over the studio . The second start was halted by the camera operator : something was wrong with the way the lighting struck Miss Loy 's left eyelashes . The third start was interrupted be-  | cause one of the little Blandings daughters had moved her arm when Miss Loy had uttered the word " undermine " instead of " education " as in previous takes . The fourth stop was another airplane , as was the fifth . The sixth stop was one of the longest . The camera operator in a mixture of disgust and self-blame yelled , " Miss Loy 's scrambled eggs have gone dry ! " They had been waiting to be eaten for more than an hour . A property man , with proper union sanction to act as a short-order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crate of eggs and scrambled and garnished two . The seventh start really looked as if it would finish . The reason it did n't was no less a one than Cary Grant . He had only one line to utter : stern parental rebuke that was to end the scene . He had now been waiting more than an hour and a half to deliver it , and tension tells even on the most experienced and adroit ; when his line finally came up it was more than he could bear : in the middle of his sternness , he broke into uproarious laughter . " Twenty minutes ' rest for everybody , " said Mr. Potter . The next time it went through like a breeze . But I was beginning to realize that the shooting of a movie is the one thing in the world more harrowing than the building of a house . As another small example , the men from the Screen Actors Guild hired to play the carpenters could n't make the grade of reality : it takes real carpenters to handle carpenters ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpenters , it was fine with the carpenters but not with the Screen Actors Guild . The eventual solution was that the actorcarpenters were paid standby time for doing nothing while the real carpenters acted their parts and were paid according to the regular carpenter 's scale . I must say I found twisted joy in some other things that happened while the shooting went on . For instance , the book depicted the excavation as flooding from an uncovered spring . The actual shooting situation was precisely the reverse : the excavation could not be made to hold water . It took heavy-duty pumps , out of reach of the microphones and connected to the excavation by fire hoses , to keep the excavation full . The incredible thing is that the studio rated Mr. Blandings as an " extremely easy " picture to shoot . Hank Potter had a 6o-day schedule : he " brought it in , " as they say , in 65 ? and the five-day overrun was due to illnesses . In a storm scene near the end of the picture the water sprays and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she came down with a bad cold . Melvyn Douglas , a sympathetic soul , to whom the script gave the inestimable privilege of kissing her five times ( while being paid for it , the shame of it all ) , not unnaturally caught the same disease , and Hank Potter him-  | self came down with something in the realm of psychosomatic medicine that was never really diagnosed . Before the picture was finished , Somebody got the bright idea of getting builders to put up a number of Dream Houses all over the country and eventually selling or raffling them off for charity , completely equipped and furnished . This involved tie-ups with local contractors , department stores , equipment companies and the like . The General Electric Company picked that one up , and bang , there was a tie-up : all Dream Houses would have GE equipment . Then it occurred to Somebody in GE to wonder , at the 11th hour , what kind of kitchen equipment was going to be shown in the picture itself ? East Coast called West Coast to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prop stuff and there was n't anything td do about it because the kitchen scenes would be shot two days later and the studio could n't afford to wait . Hold everything , said GE we 'll have the stuff there in time ! This involved shipping a washing machine and a refrigerator to Hollywood by air to make sure that the very latest models would appear on the screen . Everything arrived in time and the kitchen scenes were shot without delay . At last there came the evening of the Sneak Preview of Mr. Blandings in a Los Angeles theater , unannounced and unheralded . A little after it was over , a lot of angry telephone bells began ringing . Where was that kitchen scene ? A GE man had been in the audience and he damn well wanted to know . By now you well know where the kitchen scene was : it was on the cutting-room floor . This account , I suppose , should end on a note of high social comment on Hollywood . But I am afraid I have none to make and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made already . A simple remark made to me when I came home , enthusiastic for the Hollywood I had seen , explained a great deal to me : " Everything depends on whom you fall in with . " The people I fell in with I liked .
