Defense Secretary Louis Johnson 's big budget-pruning shears were clipping the U.S. Navy where it hurt-in the wings . Aiming at a cut of nearly $1 billion in the current budgets of the three armed services , Johnson had ordered the Navy to lop off $353 million as its share and let the admirals decide where to do the trimming . Last week the Navy was obediently dismantling 21% of its air arm to meet the new ceiling . Twenty-eight Navy and seven Marine combat squadrons were being withdrawn from service ; operations were being reduced at six air bases . <P> If it had been given time to do a gradual job , there was not much doubt that the Navy could have melted away $353 million in fat without nicking the muscle . But by demanding the cutback immediately , Johnson had forced the Navy to chop away at the only big target in sight . As a result , Louis Johnson 's big plans for economy were beginning to look more like a blueprint for disarmament .
