Will make retroactive to July 1 any new agreement which is finally reached . Bargaining Session On Further , Lewis reserved the right for the union or the operators to set aside this arrangement on five days notice . The two proposals were made public as Lewis and the operators went into a bargaining session . When the meeting broke up after 3 hours , those attending said neither side had rejected or accepted anything . Another session will be held tomorrow . The miners ' welfare fund now contains about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 10 cents a ton by the operators for each ton of coal mined . The mine owners proposed that 50 per cent of the collections be set aside for pensions . They woulc not increase the present 10 cent tonnage payments . In addition to pensions , the money would-be divided this way : 12 Per cent for death benefits , 15 Per cent for hospitalization and medical care , and 23 Per cent for distress and hardship . The operators proposed a total payment of $100 a month in pensions  --  but that would include the government 's social security benefits and the retirement age would be fixed at 65 . The Lewis plan calls for $100 Monthly payments to UMW members 62 years old who hid-20 years service in the mines and retired after May 29 , 1946 ? Van Horn Fights Plan Lewis and Sen. Bridges , as trustees of the fund , agreed to this plan April 12 . Operator trustee Ezra Van liom objected and has asked the courts to block any Pensions under the proposal . He contends the plan is not in conformity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Along with their plan for welfare payments , the operators proposed that a new contract eliminate the so-called " able and willing " clause from the present contract . That clause says the miners will work when able and willing .

In effect , that was an indirect contention  --  the same Van Horn has made  --  that the Lewis-Bridges plan is not . On wages , the operators said : " %ages are not the primary matter in this conference . The miner is the highest paid industrial worker in the country . His Purchasing power has increased a substantial 86 per cent since 1939 , while the purchasing power for manufacturing employes bas moved up only 29 per cent in the same period of time . " We believe that the , miner 's wages should continue at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The employers offered to insert in their contract a union shop provision " to become effective when and to the extent permitted by las That would mean that Lewis , to get a union shop clause , would have to sign the non-Communist affidavit required by the TaftHartley law . ' Altho outspoken against Communists , Lewis has refused to sign such an affidavit . ( Under a union shop , the employer can hire a nonunion man but the new employe must join the union. ) 40 Hour Week OK 'd The operators also proposed continuing the present 40 hour work week . Some union district scale committees have recommended that Lewis seek a 35 hour week , with premium pay for work over 35 hours . Some of these district committees also proposed increasing the $100 vacation pay . The operators would continue that payment . For many years , the mine workers policy has been " no contract , no work . " That has meant a work stoppage whenever a contract ran out , and a new one had not been negotiated . What Lewis announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The miners get a vacation period beginning June 25 and ending July 5.
