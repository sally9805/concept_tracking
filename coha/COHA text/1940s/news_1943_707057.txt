txt While the two leading tax proposals now before the House were being torn to bits in a second day of verbal bombardment on the floor , attention turned to Democratic manoeuvres . Democratic leaders confessed they were unable to tell how majority members stood as of today on the Ways and Means Committee bill , but it was an open secret that both on Capitol Hill and in the executive departments some Democrats were seeking a compromise not unacceptable to the Republicans who are supporting the modified Ruml plan embraced in the Carlson bill . Some Democrats foresaw political embarrassment for the majority party in the Ways and Means measure . With the debate ranging from a classroom lecture on tax economics by Representative Dewey , Republican , of Illinois , who is a former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury , to an outburst of anger by Chairman Doughton of the Ways and Means Committee when Representative Ditter , Republican , of Pennsylvania , said he was " declaring war on the American public , " the Carlson and the Ways and Means Committee bills were being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republicans The Carlson bill and the committee measure , which would allow discounts to encourage taxpayers to put themselves on a current basis by discharging the obligations of two tax years in one , were shot at from every conceivable angle . The committee measure was branded " a loan-shark bill , " while the Carlson bill 's Ruml plan was called a political bid by the Republican party for support in the 1944 campaign . Commenting on a speech by Representative Poulson , a new Republican member from California , who attacked the Rural plan , Representative Disney , Democrat , of Oklahoma , supporting the committee bill. , said " the calves are out of the lot . " He meant , he said , that Republicans who oppose the Ruml plan were now showing themselves . However . others thought the greater significance of the Poulson speech was that he attacked both // DEMOCRATS WAVER DURING TAX DEBATE // the Ruml plan and the committee bill . Mr. Poulson 's was the first speech at this stage of the debate to denounce both the committee and Ruml plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wind . While the Robertson plan to cancel that part of the liability on 1942 income covered by the normal and first surtax rates has been generally regarded as the most likely compromise , this also was violently attacked on the floor today as " socialistic , " and on other grounds . The Robertson plan is embodied in the Forand bill . Doubt Backing for Third Plan Democrats who are seeking a compromise expressed themselves as fearful that the Robertson plan would not be acceptable to enough Republicans to be adopted , and attention turned to the " second Doughton plan , " which amounts in essence to half a Ruml plan ; namely , the cancellation of half of the tax liability on either 1942 or 1943 income . It was pointed out that this is what Canada is about to do ? cancel half of the obligation on last year 's income . One Democrat , believed to express the opinion of others , said " the President is for as much pay-as-you-go as is feasible , the Treasury is for at least some of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ways and Means Committee with something nobody wants . " Speaking before a large blackboard set up in the well of the House , Representative Dewey lectured his colleagues on what he said would be the economic effects of the committee 's proposals . " I 've had some experience with taxes and government finance , " he said , " but I 've never seen anything so fantastic as this 6 per cent feature . " He was referring to the committee 's provision that those who pay all of their Federal income tax obligation for income of the year 1943 , before June 15 , after paying the full obligation on 1942 income , would get a 6 per cent discount in the tax on their 1943 income . " Thousands of taxpayers will sell their government securities on or before June 15 in order to take advantage of the discount , " he declared . Tax Discount Denounced Mr. Dewey declared that a $1,000 government bond would yield the owner $18.75 in the nine months . from June 15 , 1943 , to March 15 1944 , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 6 per cent discount , the discount would represent $60 in the same nine months , an actual yield of 8 per cent a year . " The man of means will naturally conclude that there is no point in holding government bonds at 2% per cent when he can get S per cent by selling these and paythe taxes at discounts , " he added . Mr. Dewey recited these lines : " Discount brothers  --  discount fast , The discount racket can not last . The Treasury will shortly know , It only helps the boys with dough ; They 'll cash their bonds and pay their tax , And then being current , can relax ; That wo n't help the revenue , But it surely helps the wealthy few . " Mr. Dewey branded the Robertson plan , which is supported by the C. I. 0. , as " perfectly socialistic in character and unsounded in principle . " He defended the " middleclass group of taxpayers who have carried the burden of taxation during the trying Thirties . " Lynch Attacks Ruml Plan Representative Lynch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of politics against Republicans supporting the Carlson bill . He called the Rural plan " ready relief for the rich , " and added that the Republican party was " starting a new WPA , not to help the poor of the country , but a War Profits Aid to help those in the high income brackets . " " In desperation they are now looking ahead for an issue for the next Presidential election , " Mr. Lynch said , " and Beardsley Rural today , like Wendell Willkie in 1940 , has sown the seed . The RumlReady-Relief for the Rich may prove a springboard in 1944 for the Republican nomination as ' Information Please ' did in 1940 . " Representative Dingel , Democrat , of Michigan , a member of the Ways and Means Committee , declared that " not all the bait in the Ruml plan is to be found in the legalized rape of the ' Treasury , " but " the minority , sitting on the Republican side of the aisle , has promise of abundant campaign funds should the remission bring about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know but what the generous Republicans would not remember the assistance given them by a few Democrats on our side . " Says " Loan Sharks " Are Busy Representative Reed , Republican of New York , charged that the committee bill was " a loan shark bill . " " There are millions of taxpayers who shudder when they think of being driven by this bill into the jaws of the loan sharks , " he declared . " At this very moment loan sharks are hanging around the war plants like vultures . I have reliable information ? and the whole report will soon be made public  --  that $100,000,000 has been loaned , under cover , at interest rates of from 120 to 240 per cent , and $500,000,000 at from 30 to 36 per cent . But this is only the beginning . Instead of making the taxpayer current , you majority members are putting him in hock for life . " When Mr. Reed was challenged on his figures , and asked to identify their source , he replied : " Take a look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee . If that does n't stink , I do n't know what does . " Representative Ditter arose late in the afternoon to make a speech of " sympathy " for Representative Doughton , who , he said , " will give more time and more time ( for speaking ) to any adventurers willing to join his lost cause of combating public opinion . " " He has declared war against the newspapers and against the intelligence of the American people , which seems to be reasserting it , self , " Mr. titter continued . " I confess it must seem like an ef-1 Ifrontery to him for the American people to show some signs of intelligence and come to their own decision without the pressure of the New Deal to mold it . " Mr. Ditter said that what he de1 scribed as the sudden upsurge of public sentiment against dictation from Washington was a " fifth freedom " which President Roosevelt failed to mention . Mr. Doughton denounced Mr. Ditter as " never contributing anything but politics to our discussions here . " He kept on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At one time three or four were shouting and the elderly Ways and Means chairman strode in the direction of the Republicans shouting so loud and vehemently that what he said was largely lost . Later , Mr. Ditter referred , to it as " invective and abuse . " The National Grange today issued a statement favoring " turning the tax clock ahead " one year as proposed in the Ruml plan and the Carlson bill . The debate will continue tomorrow and end Monday , but it is expected several additional days will be taken in offering and discussing amendments . Meanwhile , a political coincidence occurred which does not necessarily have any connection with the tax debate . Representative Knutson , Republican , of Minnesota , who is managing the Carlson bill on the floor , has told reporters on several occasions , jestingly , that he thought the Republicans could hold support of the Florida Democrats for the Carlson bill " if the President has n't more judgeships than we think he has . " The President today sent to the Senate the nomination of Dozier A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as Federal district judge for the Southern and Northern districts of Florida . He is a law partner of Charles 0 . Andrews Jr. , son of Senator . Andrews of Florida . Mr. Knutson said he would look into the possibility that some attempt was being made to line up the Florida vote behind the committee bill , but he had no knowledge that there was any intention to do so .
