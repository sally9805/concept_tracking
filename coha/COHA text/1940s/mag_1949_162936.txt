After three months in the hurly-burly of Paris , the U.N . was back last week in its well-ordered plastic tower at Lake Success . The air was heavy with French perfume from over there . The freshly waxed green and candy pink corridors rang with cheery greetings of homing travelers . But there was little to be cheerful about . <P> The Security Council reconvened for its 397th meeting , to consider the war in Indonesia . In the week since the Council 's last Paris session , the Dutch had made every effort to make the world forget the war and concentrate on Indonesia 's future . Twelve days after the Security Council ordered him to , the Dutch commander in Indonesia , Lieut . General S. H. Spoor , had told his troops to cease fire ( except for " action against roaming groups and gangs or individuals who try to cause disturbances " ) . Pale , tired Dutch Prime Minister Willem Drees flew to Batavia , to get Republicans to cooperate in a Dutch-sponsored Indonesian interim government . Queen Juliana promised Indonesia " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a federal state . " <P> But at Lake Success , only Dutch Representative J. H. van Royen had kind words for his country 's action . U.N . ' s Good Offices Committee , which has been trying to mediate between the Dutch and Indonesians , gloomily suggested it might as well quit . Philippine Representative Carlos P. Romulo deplored the Council 's " labyrinthine self-justifications . " Australia 's peppery Norman Makin cried that the Security Council could not " bury its head in the sands of Lake Success . " Indonesia 's L. N. Palar warned : " This is only the beginning of our war of self-defense . " <P> U.S. military observers considered this no idle threat , believed that the Indonesians could continue a guerrilla war for months . <P> On the sands of Lake Success , the Council adjourned to have another go at the case this week . It was as though U.N . had never left home .
