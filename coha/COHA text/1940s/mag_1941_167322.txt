( See Cover ) <P> Last week , from the mists of the North Atlantic , naval guns roared a message to the U.S. The guns belonged to the ill-fated German battle cruiser Bismarck , and hapless H.M.S. Hood ( see p. 21 ) . <P> Their simple , terrible message was that one set of the guns might almost as well have belonged to a warship of the U.S. Navy . For on that day , as for many a day past , U.S. naval headquarters in Washington was both surprised and relieved when another 24 hours went by with no news that a U.S. ship had fatally brushed with a Nazi surface raider , submarine or patrolling warplane . <P> It was altogether possible that U.S. naval vessels were within hearing of the Hood 's last blast . The U.S. Atlantic Fleet keeps a regular ( although , in those northern waters , a scattered ) patrol on behalf of the British . It was even possible ( though unlikely ) that some patrolling U.S. ship tipped off the British to the Nazi rovers ' whereabouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bismarck and her escorts beforehand , the tip-off would have been quickly given-that is what the U.S. patrol is for . <P> In any event , once the U.S. Navy had heard of the Hood 's destruction , certainly one of the first men to be advised was Admiral Ernest Joseph King , Commander in Chief , Atlantic Fleet . <P> Wherever he was , Admiral King was in dangerous waters . If there was any doubt about the danger , the Nazis ' Grand Admiral Erich Raeder in Berlin removed it when he defied Ernie King 's fleet to pass from patrol to all-out convoy , and said : " Nobody can expect a German warship to look on while an American warship communicates the position of a German man-of-war to the British Admiralty . Such procedure must be regarded as an act of war . . . . " <P> Nitroglycerin . In the Navy , there are only two opinions of Ernest Joseph King . <P> One : that he is a great fellow and a great sailorman . The other : that he is a no-good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of both judgments , granting that he would probably be at least as unpleasant to an enemy in war as he seems to be to people who dislike him . If that estimate did not now prevail , he would not be commander of the Atlantic Fleet . <P> " Temper ? Do n't fool with nitroglycerin , " the Naval Academy 's Lucky Bag recorded of Ernie King when he graduated in 1901 ( after a mid-school interlude of active duty during the Spanish-American War , on patrol off the Atlantic Coast ) . That temper subsequently hindered his Navy career , made enemies , often saddened friends who had the utmost faith in his capacities . Testifying before Congressional committeemen , he has been known to fly into ugly , inarticulate rage . Such incidents did him no good , either with Congress or with the Navy command . <P> Yet on occasion he can be graceful and charming : there is a Navy saying that 62-year-old , egg-bald Admiral King can outdance any young ensign at night , outwork him next day . <P> There is a storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best . For his staff service in the Atlantic during World War I , he won the Navy Cross . For his brilliant salvage of the sunken submarine S-51 ( lost with 33 lives ) in 1925 , he got the Distinguished Service Medal . When the S-4 was rammed and lost with 40 men in 1927 , he was again called to salvage duty , had the rare Gold Star added to his D.S.M.
