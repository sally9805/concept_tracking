Arthur Creech-Jones is a quiet little man , but what he had to say electrified the U.N . After 25 years in Palestine , the British were ready to pull out . <P> U.N . found itself staring at the newest problem in its lap : What now ? Said Britain 's Colonial Secretary , who doubles as a delegate : " . . . The mandate should now be terminated . ... I earnestly hope that the United Nations may have more success than the United Kingdom has had in persuading Jews and Arabs to cooperate . . . . " As he spoke , Jewish representatives and Arab committeemen sat with their backs to each other . <P> The British , Creech-Jones promised , would put their " experience " at the disposal of U.N . They would even stay on in Palestine for a brief transition period - provided U.N . could find a solution to which Jews and Arabs would peaceably agree . But , said the Colonial Secretary with deliberate emphasis : " His Majesty 's Government are not themselves prepared to undertake the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms . ... In the absence of a settlement they must plan for an early withdrawal of British forces . . . . " If His Majesty 's Government had a preference for any particular solution in Palestine. * Creech-Jones kept it to himself . <P> <P> Crackling events reminded U.N . what enforcing solutions might mean . In the Eastern Mediterranean , British destroyers intercepted another shipload of Jewish refugees ; one Jew was shot to death and nine were wounded in a scuffle with the boarding party . In Palestine , Haganah stepped up recruiting . Five Zionist leaders , including Jewish Agency President David Ben-Gurion , received messages signed by " the commander in chief of fighting Arab youth for free Palestine . " The messages promised : " You will die as soon as possible . . . . " <P> From Jerusalem , the Arab Higher Committee invited the Arab and Islamic worlds to demonstrate Oct. 3 for an Arab Palestine . The Moslem League paper Dawn pleaded for a united Moslem front for 5,000 miles , from Morocco to the Punjab , called on Moslems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> At U.N. , Palestine Arabs promised " defense of our beloved country with the last drop of our blood . " <P> British soldiers guarding road blocks in Palestine merely asked : " When do we go home ? " <P> <P> * Before a U.N . Assembly committee this week was the 165-page report of the U.N . Special Committee on Palestine ( UNSCOP ) containing two diverging plans . UNSCOP 's majority favored partition of Palestine into Jewish and Arab nations , with independence set for Sept. 1 , 1949 . The minority plan ( advanced by India , Persia and Yugoslavia ) proposed semi-autonomous Jewish and Arab states within a Palestine federation , in which , because of greater numbers , the Arabs would elect the chief executive . Zionists regarded the majority plan as better than nothing . Arabs denounced both plans , opposed a Jewish state of any kind in Palestine .
