Farm prices have stolen a backward march on Leon Henderson , have declined without waiting for a ceiling to be clamped on them . Wheat last week was down 15 a bushel from the 1942 high ; corn , 5 ; rye , 28/5 soybeans , 27 ; cotton , 2 : a pound ; eggs , 4 a dozen . <P> Before Leon set up his general price top two months ago , he had bellowed time &; again that price control could not work unless farm prices were included too . But farm prices , after soaring 44% in the 13 months ending last January , have just wound up four straight months of fairly stable prices . They stopped going up-at least temporarily-three months before Leon temporarily halted the rise in living costs in May . <P> Actually the decline in major farm prices is just as much a result of Government action as the freeze in the cost of living . Wheat , corn , rye and cotton were all phony prices in the early part of the year , were supported by political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hope of bigger loans to come . When the Administration froze parity ( by freezing other prices ) , and spread the word that it would not boost loans still higher , speculators ducked out of those commodities in which the Government is holding huge surpluses off the market . <P> But prices like beef and pork , which are based mainly on real demand , are still climbing .
