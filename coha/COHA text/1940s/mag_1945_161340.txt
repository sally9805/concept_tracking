The first year of the atomic age drew to a close amid a noisy bustle of Christmas shopping ( most extravagant on record ) , of unrationed auto traffic , of holiday travel and partying such as the U.S. had never seen before . <P> The long lines in front of the annual Christmas week show at Manhattan 's Radio City Music Hall , the picket lines in Detroit , the lines of dazzling lights reappearing on the trees along Hollywood Boulevard-all these , in their own manner , offered proof that the U.S. was back to some kind of normalcy after four years of war . The uniforms were disappearing ; the face of the land and the face of the people took on a prewar complexion . <P> Yet if the war was fading , its denouement was not . Opinion polls showed that the overriding subject of U.S. interest was still , as at any given moment since Hiroshima , the atom bomb . Never before since the pollsters set up shop had one topic evoked such continuous , prolonged , intense public concern . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reconversion , the Pearl Harbor investigation , the housing shortage nor this week 's Big Three meeting , not even Santa Claus - had been able to drive the bomb from topmost place in the U.S. mind . <P> I Never Was . Interviewing the man-in-the-street , the pollsters found a deep and turbulent stream of consciousness to explore . <P> Said a Baltimore housewife : " I dread the thought that it was discovered . I was never enthusiastic about it , even when we knew it was ending the war . I 'm glad no other country discovered it ; I wish we could find some way of destroying the plans and the secret so no one would know about it , including us . ... The bomb is inhuman . ... " <P> A Brooklyn salesman : " I think the bomb should be kept secret . Even if other nations can find out , we should not tell them . Because right now we do n't know what the future will bring . Like this , we have a chance . Let them find out for themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use in future wars , if the nations in power prevent it . They can do this by organization . All nations , small and big , should get together . The thing that stands in the way is that some group may not like the idea . Russia , to tell the truth . She 's the only one that I can think of ... " <P> <P> There Never Will Be . An Arkansas accountant : " There never will be a counter-weapon to eliminate the horrors and the devastation.There will be a defense to some extent , though ; they 'll find similar destructive devices to prevent aircraft from getting through . But we wo n't know if there 's a defense until the next war . If one is invented it will be kept secret until there is a need for it . ... But we should n't share the bomb now ; I mean we should n't share it with any nation at all . Because the next three or four years are very critical . There is a lot of dissension in China , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years things will be more settled-closer to peace . Then the countries will be able to contemplate the economic and commercial uses of atomic energy , instead of the war uses . . . . "
