txt // find in the higher animals ; but , in addition , we find many higher intellectual elements such as language , self-consciousness , morality , religion , and all the other products of man 's higher intellectual faculties . Peculiar human instincts may give human society a different character to some extent , but this distinctive character is more largely attributable to man 's higher intellectual development . The Struggle for Existence in Human Society. ? From the very beginning there has been no such thing as unmitigated individual struggle among animals . Nowhere in nature does pure individualism exist in the sense that the individual animal struggles alone , except perhaps in a few solitary species which are apparently on the way to extinction . The assumption of such a primitive individual struggle has been at the bottom of many erroneous views of human society . The primary conflict is between species . A secondary conflict , however , is always found between members of the same species . Usually this conflict within the species is a competition between groups . The human species exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other species of animals . The supremacy of man over the rest of the animal world was won only after an age-long conflict between man and his animal rivals . While this conflict was going on there was apparently but little struggle within the species itself . The lowest groups of which we have knowledge , while continually struggling against nature , are rarely at war with one another . But after man had won his supremacy over nature and the population of groups increased so as to encroach seriously upon food supply , and even territorial limits of space , then the conflict between human groups which we call war broke out and became almost second nature to man . However , before we can understand how war arose between human groups , we must know something about primitive human history . Primitive Human History . Anthropologists tell us that the whole history of man may be roughly divided into three stages ? savagery , barbarism , and civilization . Savagery was the stage in which man was a mere child of nature , living off the wild fruits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat , making no attempt to control his own destiny . This collecting and hunting stage lasted for the race at least one hundred thousand years , anthropological evidence shows . To this day , some belated human groups still survive in it . Barbarism was a transitional stage in which man began to cultivate the soil and to raise domestic animals . But he soon turned his attention to preying on his fellow man as an easier method of gaining a livelihood than the mastering of physical nature . This stage of preliterate agriculture began in Europe about seven or eight thousand years ago with the coming of Neolithic man . Civilization in the strict sense began only with the invention of writing and with the keeping of historic records ? with man 's coming to self-consciousness and with his beginning of control or mastery over the mental and social elements in his life . Civilization in this strict sense is therefore a very recent development in social evolution . Its beginnings were not more than five thousand years ago for any people , and for most European peoples it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet achieved anything like complete civilization ; and among all peoples we find still surviving more or less of the typical institutions of barbarism . There is considerable overlapping in the different stages of human culture . Most of the typical institutions of the barbaric stage survive in the earlier stages of civilization . Such institutions as slavery and fixed social castes we got rid of but very recently , while even today we are trying to rid ourselves of autocracy , class exploitation , and militarism . Militancy and predatoriness are among the chief traits of barbarism . Out of them rew its typical institutions , such as slavery , class exploitation , fixed social classes or castes , polygamy , ceremonial politeness , and barbarous class display . In a scientific discussion of war the first thing to remember is the fact that anthropology shows that military institutions did not develop in human societies until the stage of barbarism or preliterate agriculture . The very conditions of primitive life were such as to necessitate comparative peace in human groups . Human populations // were too small and too scattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brute world and with physical nature . The common assumption , still largely prevalent , that the primitive state of mankind was one of constant warfare has been completely discredited by the progress of anthropological knowledge . The most primitive peoples of which we have knowedge are essentially unwarlike . For example , the Veddas of Ceylon and the Eskimos of the Arctic coast of North America , two very primitive peoples in widely different environments , are among the most unwarlike peoples known . In other words , the peoples whom by a strange misnomer we call " savages " are found upon scientific investigation to be relatively peaceful ; that is , they rarely engage in conflicts with other human groups . Thus disappears the dogma that war is a " natural " condition of mankind and with it the belief in the inevitability and universality of war as a social condition . But we know that war became habitual and prevalent among many peoples in the stage of barbarism . At the advent of barbarism the beginnings of agriculture made possible an increased and stable food supply and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly filled up . Peoples began to encroach upon one another 's hunting grounds and food supplies . These new economic conditions led to numerous conflicts between groups . Then , as the brute world was largely subdued , human groups came to fear no enemies so much as other human groups . The groups which were most successful in warlike enterprise found that war was an easier method to obtain food and wealth than the slow and tedious methods of primitive agriculture . A selection was thus started among human groups on the basis of war , those having the greatest efficiency in warlike weapons or organization having the best chance of surviving . Thus war primitively arose from economic conditions , and it is remarkable how economic conditions have had a part in bringing about almost all the great wars in human history . The Social Effects of War . Along with the obvious destructive effects of war have gone certain effects upon human social organizaSTRUGGLE // t ion and upon the evolution of human groups which we must note . War has been the chief agency of group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has had an immense effect upon human culture and human social evolution . Six chief effects should be noted , as follows : ( I ) Intergroup wars gave rise to higher forms of social organization , because in such wars only those groups could succeed that were well organized , and especially only those that had competent leadership . ( 2 ) Government , as we know it in history , was very largely an outcome of the necessities of this intergroup struggle , or war . As we have seen , the groups that were best organized , that had the most competent leadership , would stand the best chance of surviving . Consequently the war leader or chief soon came , through habit , to be looked upon as the head of the group in all matters . Moreover , the exigencies and stresses of war frequently necessitated giving the war chief supreme authority in times of danger , and from this , without doubt , arose despotism in all of its forms . The most primitive tribes are republican or democratic in their form of government ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly develop where a people are continually at war with other peoples . ( 3 ) A third result of war in early society was the creation of social classes . After a certain stage was reached groups tried not so much to exterminate one another as to conquer and absorb one another . This was , of course , after agriculture had been developed and slave labor had reached a considerable value . Under such circumstances a conquered group would be incorporated by the conquerors as a slave or subject class . Later , this enslaved class may have become partially free as compared with some more recently subjugated or enslaved classes , and several classes in this way could emerge in a group through war or conquest . Moreover , the presence of these alien and subject elements in a group necessitated a stronger and more centralized government to keep them in control , and this was again one way in which war favored a development of despotic governments . Later , // of course , economic conditions gave rise to classes , and to certain struggles between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were social and political organization and the evolution of classes favored by intergroup struggle , but also the evolution of morality . The group that could be most efficiently organized would be , other things being equal , the group which had the most loyal and most self-sacrificing membership . The group that lacked a group spirit , that is , strong sentiments of solidarity , and harmonious relations between its members , would be the group that would be apt to lose in conflict with other groups , and so its type would tend to be eliminated . The morality which war developed , however , was a narrow , or " group " morality ; and it was autocratic rather than democratic . Thus while loyalty , mutual aid , and honor were enforced within the tribe , war encouraged the disregard of the rights of all outside ; and while war developed habits of obedience , service , and self-sacrifice on the part of all members of the group , it led to the disregard of the life and personality of individuals . ( 5 ) Another consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weaker groups and the growth of larger and larger political groups until in modern times a few great nations dominate the population of the whole world . That this was not the primitive condition , we know from human history and from other facts which indicate the disappearance of a vast number of human groups in the past . The earth is a burial ground of tribes and nations as well as of individuals . In the competition between human groups , only a few that have had efficient organization and government , loyal membership , and high standards of conduct within the group , have survived . Philologists estimate that for every living language there are twenty dead languages . Remembering that one language not infrequently stands for several groups with related cultures , we can get an inkling of the immense number of human societies that have perished in the past in this intergroup competition . ( 6 ) Modern war is essentially a survival of barbarism . History shows that the area of peace , that is , of settling disputes by unwarlike // methods , has constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settle their disputes now no longer think of doing so because they are parts of a larger organization , a larger social unity , built up partly by the pressure of material interests , partly by widening civilization , and partly by broadening sympathy and good will . Observation shows that whether conflicting moral or material interests lead men to war depends upon their aims , standards , and previous habits . Sociologists in general are therefore practically unanimous in concluding that the real causes of war are always in the cultural conditions and social standards of peoples . Where the tradit ions of a people are nonmilitant , they begin no wars , no matter what the external geographic and economic conditions may be . On the other hand , with warlike mores the most trifling things may be occasions for war . Warlike mores arise and flourish under those economic , intellectual , and moral conditions which characterize the stage of barbarism . Hence the conclusion that war is a survival from the stage in which the tradition of force was dominant . What some of the changes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be dealt with more or less in the discussion of the best forms of social organization and the best methods of human progress . We must not in our desire for peace ignore the part which war has played in past human social evolution . Once war selected well the stronger , more efficient , more socialized human groups . But modern wars produce a " reversal of selection " in human society by killing off the socially fittest and tending to rebarbarize the moral standards of nations . We have left behind the stage of history when war can contribute to the building of civilization . War is now a disease of our civilization . Hence higher civilization must find a better way than war of deciding the competition between human groups . Competition. ? Even though war passes away entirely , nations can never escape competition . While the competition may not be upon the low and brutal plane of war , it will certainly go on upon the higher plane of commerce and industry and will probably be quite as decisive in the life of peoples in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While the primary struggle within the human species has been in the historic period between nations and races , this is not saying , of course , that struggle and competition has not gone on within these larger groups . On the contrary , a continual struggle has gone on between classes , first perhaps of racial origin and later of economic origin . Also there is within the nation a struggle between parties and sects and sometimes between " sections " and communities . Usually , however , the competition within the nation is a peaceful one and does not come to bloodshed . Again within each of these minor groups above mentioned struggle and competition in some modified form goes on between its members . Thus within a party or class there is apt to be a struggle or competition between factions . There is , indeed , no human group that is free from struggle or competition between its members , unless it be the family at its best . Competition and Co-operation . Evidently , competition and co-operation are twin principles in the evolution of social groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups , especially independent political groups , and while co-operation characterizes in the main the relation of the members of a given group to one another , still competition and co-operation are correlatives in practically every phase of the social life . Some degree of competition , for example , has to be maintained by every group between its members if it is going to maintain high standards of efficiency or of loyalty . If there were not competition with respect to the matters that concern the inner life of groups , the groups would soon lose efficiency in leadership and membership and would sooner or later be eliminated . It follows from this that competition and co-operation are equally important in the life of society . It has been a favorite idea that competition among human beings should be done away with , and that co-operation should be substituted to take its place entirely . It is evident , however , that this idea is impossible of realization . If a social group were to check all competition between its members , it would stop thereby the process of natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , as a consequence , would soon cease to progress . If some scheme of artificial selection were substituted to take the place of natural selection , it is evident that competition would still have to be retained to determine who were the fittest . A society that would give positions of trust and responsibility to individuals without imposing some competitive test upon them would be like a ship built partly of good and partly of rotten wood , ? it would soon go to pieces . What people may rightfully object to is , not competition , but unregulated or unfair competition . In the interest of solidarity , that is , in the interest of the life of the group as a whole , all forms of competition in human society should be so regulated that the rules governing the competition may be known and the competition itself public . It is evident that in politics and in business we are very far from this ideal as yet , although society is unquestionably moving toward it . The Necessity of Selection in Society. ? This leads us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No doubt natural selection is often a brutal and wasteful means of eliminating the weak in human societies , and no doubt human reason might devise superior means of bringing about the selection of individuals which society must maintain . To some extent it has done this through systems of education and the like , which are , in the main , selective processes for picking out the most competent individuals to perform certain social functions . But the natural competition , or struggle between individuals , has not been done away with , especially in economic matters , and it is evidently impossible to do away with it until some vast scheme of artificial selection can take its place . Such a scheme is so far in the future that it is hardly worth talking about . The best that society can apparently do now is to regulate competition between individuals , and this it is doing increasingly . The Sociological View of Morality. ? In conclusion let us consider the nature of moral codes and standards from the social point of view . It is evident that moral codes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of conduct which groups find it convenient // or necessary to impose upon their members . Even morality , in an idealistic sense , seems from a sociological standpoint to be those forms of conduct which conduce to the harmony , to the efficiency , and so to the survival of humanity . Groups , however , as has already been pointed out , can not do as they please . They are always hard pressed in competition by other groups and have to meet the standards of efficiency which nature imposes . Morality , therefore , is not anything arbitrarily designed by the group , but is a standard of conduct which necessities of social survival require . In other words , the right , from the point of view of social science , is that which ultimately conduces to survival , not of the individual , but of the group or of the species . This is looking at morality , of course , from the sociological point of view , and in no way denies the religious and metaphysical view of morality , which may be equally valid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Human Society. ? Finally , we need to note that biological factors do not necessitate in any mechanical sense certain conduct on the part of individuals or groups . Rather , natural selection marks the limits of variation which nature permits , and within those limits of variation there is a large amount of freedom of choice , both to individuals and to groups . Human societies , therefore , may be conceivably free to take one of several paths of development at any particular point . But in the long run they must conform to the ultimate conditions of survival ; and this probably means that the goal of their evolution is largely fixed for them . Human groups are free only in the sense that they may go either backward or forward on the path which the conditions of survival mark out for them . They are free to survive or to perish . But social evolution in any case , in the sense of social change either toward higher or toward lower social adaptation , is a necessity that can not be escaped . Sociology and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study not of what human groups would like to do , but of what they must do in order to survive , that is , how they can control their environment by utilizing the laws which govern social evolution . // Summary. ? From this brief and most elementary consideration of the bearings of evolutionary theory upon social problems it is evident that evolution , in the sense of what we know about the development of life and society in the past , must be one guidepost of the sociologist . Human social evolution , let us remember , rests upon and is conditioned by biological evolution . There is , therefore , scarcely any sanity in sociology without the biological point of view . I lowever , overemphasis upon the biological factors leads to the be-littling and neglect of psychological and cultural factors . In fact , it views human social evolution as dominated , like that of animal groups , by the factors in organic evolution . But social evolution must not he confused with organic evolution . Iluman social evolution is essentially cultural , hence psychic ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BEARING OF MODERN PSYCHOLOGY UPON SOCIAL PROBLEMS WHEN mind or consciousness appeared in organic evolution the whole balance of the world of life was changed . Thereafter the determining factors in the life process became more and more the inner and mental , not the outer and physical . Accordingly , to understand human society we must understand something of the mental life of man , for the interactions of individuals in human society are chiefly interactions of their thoughts , feelings , and will . Hence , psychology , the science of our mental life , must be the immediate basis of a large part of sociology . Knowledge of the psychology of human conduct , of behavior , is accordingly indispensable to the student of sociology . Modern Psychology. ? The earlier developments of psychological science laid a great deal of stress upon the analysis of the structure or content of the individual mind , that is , upon the analysis of the states of consciousness into their constituent elements . While this part of psychology is recognized to be of very great importance for the understanding of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sociologist , for he deals with the person in action . What the sociologist needs is a science of the mind in action . This is usually called functional psychology . It deals with individual human conduct or behavior in the widest sense , thus furnishing the basis for explaining the interactions of individuals and the evolution of social organization . Modern psychology is in its point of view broadly biological ; that is , according to modern psychology , mind is not something apart from life , but is a functioning element in the life process . It is subject , like everything else in life , therefore , to the laws of organic evolution 52 // which are discussed in Chapter II . The fundamental attributes of our mental life are not acquired by the individual in his lifetime , but are as much determined by natural selection as the general characteristics of our bodies . Thus our impulses , our feelings , desires , and interests so far as they are inborn are in the long run determined by natural selection . The thought of evolution thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but it must be borne in mind , of course , that natural selection is merely the elimination of the least favorable variations and is thus a framework within which a with the habits which the individual acquires within his lifetime . The Function of the Mind. ? All biologists and psychologists are agreed that the brain is primarily an adaptive organ . Now , whatever may be the exact relation of mind and bo , this means that the function of those higher neural processes which involve consciousness is primarily to aid the organism in adaptation , especially when the process is rapid and complex . Mental processes , in other words , are chiefly concerned with the guidance and control of complex activities . Not all bodily activities or acts are accompanied by consciousness ; but wherever the purely physiological mechanism is insufficient to secure the proper adaptation of the organism to its environment , then consciousness appears , to control and direct movement . All the aspects of the mind present themselves , therefore , from one point of view , as devices to secure the superior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angell said , " Mind seems to be the master device by means of which the adaptive operations of organic life may he made more perfect . " It would be a mistake , however , to think that the mind is concerned merely with the passive adaptation of the organism to the environment , that is , bending and shaping activities to meet the requirements of the environment . On the contrary , in its higher development the mind is equally concerned with the adaptation of the environment to the needs of the organism . This results from what is // same way in which the bodily characteristics of the species have been established . These the psychologists call the " instincts , " or native impulses , or hereditary reactions . These reactions are not acquired by the individual , but are the psychological expression , on the side of behavior , of his racial heredity , and like other inborn traits are transmitted from generation to generation with but little variation . In man , however , the " instincts " differ from those of the lower animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of the more complex hereditary structure of his nervous system , but for this reason they are more variable and alterable . In many of the lower forms of life , such as the insects , the instincts give rise to very fixed forms of behavior . In man there are few , if any , such fixed forms of behavior due to instinct , owing to his much more complex hereditary nervous structure and to the fact that the larger part of the connections in his nervous system are acquired during the lifetime of the individual . The " instincts " in man are variable also owing to individual differences in nervous structure . Again , in man those complex hereditary reactions which we term " instincts " pass through the higher nervous centers which are concerned with consciousness , and hence are more or less subject to those higher controls over behavior which we term " feeling " and " intelligence . " Finally , natural impulses get their development only through appropriate stimuli in the environment , and therefore their expression is largely controlled by man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of these reasons those activities which predominantly spring from heredity are more modifiable and alterable in man through experience than in any other animal . Nevertheless , because inborn impulses furnish the nucleus of activities by which the individual begins to master his world , and because all later adaptations are more or less influenced by these original reactions , they are exceedingly important as the basis of man 's mental and social life . They are the activities which do not need to be learned , but are in us apart from training and experience by virtue of our human heredity. // The " instincts " are the origin of certain simpler relations between individuals and so furnish the beginnings of social organization . This may be seen in such typical human instincts as sexual and parental love . Other typical " instincts " usually recognized by psychologists are gregariousness , imitativeness , constructiveness , acquisitiveness , self-assertion , combativeness , and curiosity . All of these are sufficiently in evidence in human society . It should be pointed out , however , that there is no single " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origin , much less the development , of man 's social life , since many instincts must have been concerned in bringing and keeping individuals together even in the primitive forms of association . Nevertheless , sociability itself must be considered an instinctive rather than an acquired trait . Human society , then , is rooted in " human instincts , " and the instincts are at the basis of man 's social as well as of his mental life . Accordingly , sociology must always seek , beneath habits , customs , and traditions in society , the original instinctive impulses and reactions of individuals . Since these represent the innate or biological clement , and furnish the original basis for the relationships of individuals , they may well be characterized as the primary social forces . No program of social reconstruction can possibly succeed which does not take into consideration these original tendencies of human nature ; on t lie other hand , when their control is understood , they will present no insuperable obstacle to any rational program of social reconstruction . I Ience the guidance and control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and through the appropriate organization of social life is one of the great practical problems of human society . Acquired Habits. ? Instincts are inborn , while habits are acquired . Instincts might perhaps be termed race habits , while habits in the strict sense are modifications of inherent activities acquired by individuals or groups of individuals during their lifetime . As we have already seen , instinctive reactions become modified by experience ; that is , the hereditary tendencies of the individual are adapted to new situations , and new ways of reacting are thus acquired . These // new ways of reacting , when they no longer need attention and drop more or less out of consciousness , become habits in the strict sense of the word . The earlier-formed habits become , of course , the basis for later ones through their modification by adaptation , just as instinctive reactions are modified . Thus are built up the countless habits of the mature individual . This process of building up habits out of " instincts " and previously formed habits , is from a psychological standpoint the essence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Acquired habits in time come to be " second nature , " as we say , and are not less powerful in determining conduct than the original instinctive reactions . This is as true of society as it is of the individual . Acquired habit , therefore , plays a great part in human society . The character of the adult individual is very largely the result of the habits acquired through early environment and education . The organization of society is also at any given time almost wholly the result of habit ; for social organization is the whole mass of reciprocal adjustments which individuals of a group maintain among themselves , and these are largely habitual . The psychological fact of habit is thus the main carrier of all those forms of social life and organization which rise above the merely instinctive level . Thus habit forms the chief raw material for cultural evolution . Man 's capacity to acquire an indefinite number of habits made it possible for him to take on civilization through building up social usages , customs , traditions , and institutions . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social sanction attached to them . Usages , or " folkways , " are simply the similar habits of a group of people , usually handed down from generation to generation . The " mores , " or customs , of a people are the folkways which have been reflected upon and sanctioned by the group , and hence set up as standards . Institutions are simply more highly developed and systematized , more definitely sanctioned and established social habits ; while social traditions are habitual ways of thinking and feeling handed down from generation to generation . Thus the social order // at any given time is largely a matter of habit , and the problem of its reconstruction is the problem of building up new habits adapted to new life conditions to replace old habits which are no longer adapted . The mental and social life of man centers about the psychological facts of habit and adaptation . If we lived in a slowly changing world , we should need no other controls over activity than instinct and habit ; Ian inasmuch as we live in a rapidly changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over behavior which we call " feeling , " " intelligence , " and " rationality . " Feeling. ? By feeling we mean the agreeable or disagreeable tone which accompanies conscious states . It is practically synonymous wi t h pleasure and pain , using those words in a broad way . Feeling , t hen , is the " me-side " of activity , or , more accurately , it is the subjective valuation which the organism gives to an activity . When the activity is one which has on the whole in the past history of the organism been advantageous , the resulting feeling is usually pleasurable . on the other hand , when the activity is one which has been dis.uivantageous , the feeling is disagreeable or painful . Feeling , because it is the me-side of activity , is subject to all the variations to which the individual organism is subject . Conditions of health , habit , and personal idiosyncrasies often make that which is agreeable to one person disagreeable to another . Hence , pleasure and pain are not good guides as to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings are attached to our " instincts " in the form of emotions . They powerfully reinforce , therefore , the instinctive activities . Now , the " instincts , " as we have already seen , are the result of selection in the past history of the species . They and the feelings attached to them , or the emotions , are not therefore good guides in the complex life of the present . Natural impulses , and t heir correlated emotions , need , therefore , to be controlled and guided by the reason . They are , however , rough monitors which indicate to us without the labor of thought the organically advantageous or disadvantageous . 6o MODERN PSYCHOLOGY UPON SOCIAL PROBLEMS A mistake of the psychology of the early part of the nineteenth century was its claim that pleasure and pain are the sole springs of action . But , as we have seen , feeling is the accompaniment and not the antecedent of activity . Feeling does , however , modify activity . If the feeling tone raised by the activity is pleasurable , the activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the activity tends to be inhibited . This is , however , something very different from saying that pleasure and pain are the sole sources of activity . It is important to realize that a large part of our instincts and emotions represent not high civilization , but the wild life which our ancestors lived many thousands of years ago . Hence impulse and emotion are today the great enemies of intelligence ; and perhaps the main problem of civilization may be said to be to bring about the predominance of intelligence in human relations and in social behavior . Nevertheless , we have also to recognize that nothing great in the way of achievement is ever brought about in human society without the help of emotion . It becomes , therefore , very important that we learn to discriminate among our emotions , to discourage the baser ones , and to encourage the nobler ones . Such emotions as fear , pride , anger , tend to antisocial action , while the sympathetic emotions tend to develop behavior favorable to the development of the higher types of human relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is evident that in securing changes in activities in human society it is well if possible to enlist the feelings on the side of those changes . This can best be done by connecting the change with some instinctive impulse . Now , the instinctive impulses which are most favorable to social betterment are the altruistic or sympathetic impulses . Hence it is that the sympathetic feelings can usually be appealed to in bringing about any reform or progressive change in society . Sympathy , by which we mean fellow feeling , or altruistic feeling , is , therefore , the aspect of feeling which is most socialized , and has most to do in furthering social reforms and the reconstruction of civilization upon a basis of justice and humanity . The appeal to feeling is justifiable in society , therefore , only when it is an appeal to INTELLIGENCE 6 r our sympathetic or altruistic feelings , and even these need the control of our intelligence . Nevertheless , sympathetic or altruistic feeling , because it tends to harmonize individuals in their relations and to establish mutual good will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher civilization . Intelligence. ? Intelligence is problem-solving ability . It is the side of the mind which has to do especially with the adaptation of the activities of the organism to the environment . Instinct and feeling have , as we have seen , chiefly reference to the organism and its past environment , while intelligence on the other hand is turned outward toward the rest of the universe , and so stands more for the present and the future . It functions to evaluate and control activities with reference to the environment . Knowledge , ideas , values , in other words , play the decisive role in adapting the organism to its environment . It is probable that intelligence was developed as an aid in adapting instinctive tendencies to environmental conditions and in satisfying the demands of feeling . Nevertheless , in man it can and does act independently of these . The instincts and feelings , as we have already seen , are very insufficient guides in the complex social life of the present ; hence the need of a higher instrument of adaptation than that which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in man the intellect , and the chief distinction between man and the lower animals is that he has passed through many more stages of intellectual development . Man 's intellect has been developed , in other words , to control activities in individual and collective life which can not be controlled in any other way . It is for this reason that roan has developed a higher phase of intelligence which no other animal possesses , which we call the " reason " or " rationality . " Rationality. ? Rationality is the power of the mind to solve problems by abstract thinking . In man it is the supreme device for controlling activity and modifying the environment . The power of abstract thought , of imagination and reasoning , has enabled man to build up a distinctive social life , characterized by " culture , " or // " civilization . " Language , religion , government , science , morality , and education , all these distinctive features of human society , as well as many others , have depended for their development upon this evolution of man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search for primitive social origins in man 's reason , or to think that human society is mainly a product of reflective thought , yet later social developments and movements take on more and more a rational character . Reflective thought , which probably played an insignificant part in primitive society , becomes in the highest social development the decisive element , because upon it depends the control , not only of the forces of physical nature , but also of the feelings and impulses of human nature . All this is illustrated by the part which invention and discovery have played in social development . Invention and discovery hardly exist below the human level , hence animal societies are not progressive . On the other hand , civilization in human societies has been built up largely through invention and discovery . The invention of tools , weapons , laborsaving devices , the improvements in communication and transportation , along with scientific discovery of the properties and nature of things , have been the material means by which human progress has been effected . But it should be remembered that invention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in new ways , nor is discovery confined to the understanding of the workings ? of physical nature . Quite as important phases of invention and discovery have been the making of new institutions and forms of association , the discovery of new possibilities in human living , and especially the development of social standards by which individual and social activities have been standardized and controlled . Moral development in human society has depended , therefore , very largely upon intellectual processes . Moral ideas and ideals especially have exerted a powerful influence on social relationships . Since new ideas are the creation of exceptional minds , and , since they may become powerful instruments in social progress , it is evident that the individual has also his place as a factor in social evolution . // In the higher stages of social development , therefore , the human reason plays an increasingly important part . When we remember that all the achievements of science , all of the conquests of the practical arts , all man 's mastery over nature and self , are products of his reason , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assigned to the intellect in human social evolution and progress . Hope for the social future , moreover , manifestly lies in the possibility of the increasing dominance of intelligence in our social life . Mastery over the condit ions of our social existence can come only through increasing knowledge . This means , in effect , that only science is adequate to guide the reconstruction of our social life . In proportion as we build our social life upon ascertained facts and laws of human living together , we shall be successful ; in proportion as we build upon mere emotionalism , blind tradition , or party prejudices , we shall fail . Only in the development and maintenance of the rational level of behavior lie the safety and security of civilization . The Social Character of Human Behavior , Feeling , and Thinking. ? It is evident from what has been said , that the human mind as a whole enters as a determining and active factor into the social life of man . The forces at work in human relations consist not simply of feeling elements , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impulses , whether hereditary or acquired , and all the intellectual elements which go to make up the mental life of the individual . We must , of course , not forget the influence of physical factors upon human social life , such as heredity , variation , and natural selection , and back of these the conditions of the physical environment , such as climate , soil , food , and other geographical conditions . The human mind is in interaction with all of these , although they manifest themselves chiefly in human social life through the psychological elements of impulse , feeling , and intelligence . But more important than these original factors in human social life are the acquired factors which come from the culture of the group and the accumulated experiences of individuals . It is , as has already been pointed out , the accumulation // of these factors which results in cultural evolution . They are all learned by experience and stored up in language and in other symbols . Thus human societies live , as we have already seen , not only by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society itself , which is called the social or group tradition . The social tradition is , therefore , the main determining force in social behavior , and it is tradition which gives us , in the main , our ideas , sentiments , and values concerning social behavior . The student should , therefore , not fail to note that the greater part of the ideas , sentiments , and values of the individual are derived from his culture and usually from the social traditions of his group . The importance of tradition in determining , guiding , and controlling the forces at work in human society will have to be considered a little later , in the following section of this chapter . Another fact which the elementary student in sociology should note is that the factors at work in our social life are very complex , and that it is impossible to interpret human society aright through paying attention to only one of these . Our views of the human social life must be broad enough , in other words , to include the working of all possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this book , therefore , is a synthetic one , as opposed to the many one-sided theories which are now prevalent regarding human institutions . Such a view we get even from a study of the individual mind , because such study shows that human consciousness is very largely a reflection of the complex social culture in which it has been developed , and that the mind itself is therefore socially conditioned in all of its aspects . This is true even of the " instincts " and emotions with which we are equipped by heredity , because careful study of human instincts shows that they presuppose a social medium for their evolution . Even our most abstract thought is in the nature of conversation , and therefore presupposes mental interaction , or society . Man 's mental and social life are , therefore , largely one . Mental interaction , intercommunication , is as necessary for the mind as for social life . As mind is the chief organ of adaptation for // individuals , so intercommunication is the means of adjustment between individual minds . Moreover , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and social life grow together . Human society is therefore modifiable through modifying the mentality of its individuals . Through intercommunication society carries on a collective mental life , and the individual mind gets its development largely by participating therein . These statements must not be interpreted to mean that the individual 's mental life is wholly submerged in that of his group . Biological variation and the self-active character of the individual prevent this . So far as science can discover there is no complete social determinism of individual consciousness and behavior . While the individual gets his development , both physical and psychical , in the main , from his connection with a larger life , the life of his species and of his group , this does not prevent him from developing variations of his own , both physically and mentally . If this were not so , social progress would be impossible , save through the action of natural rcicction upon groups . As it is , the individual 's variations , originalitics , and inventions may be taken up by the group through communication , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole group . Thus the individual reacts upon his group . Human society is , then , not a simple mass , but is made up of relatively independent , autonomous individuals . The key to its activities is not , therefore , in some principle which simply applies to the mass as a whole , but rather in the laws and principles of individual behavior . Social Tradition. ? So far as there is a single key to understanding the social behavior of men , it lies in the concepts of culture , and social tradition . Social tradition is the subjective side of culture , passed along by various forms of communication . It includes all the ideas , sentiments , and values connected with industry , government , law , rt , science , religion , morality , education , and all other human institutions . It is dominantly a way of thinking and of feeling handed down from generation to generation , while custom is the way of doing thus handed down . The chief vehicle of tradition is oral and // written language . Football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far as its rules , standards , and values have been embodied in oral and written speech . The actual playing of the game is a custom . Together , as we have already seen , custom and tradition make up the culture of the group . But tradition is the main element in culture , for the patterns of action and the values embodied in tradition are what sustain all social customs . These patterns of action , lodged in the minds of individuals , become the standard by which the members of a human group measure and control their behavior . Hence , individual behavior is of a high or low type according to the tradition of the group . Democratic behavior , for example , can not be preserved without a strong democratic tradition . Tradition is what makes the continuity of human society . It makes its historical continuity . All civilization is due to the development of traditions . Thus the traditions of law and government have gradually accumulated and been refined . So also the traditions of our religion and morality . Science , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance of tradition . For all of the knowledge of science , except the little which is being added at the present , is tradition . Yet scientific knowledge is becoming increasingly the basis for wise social adjustments . It is the sociological fact of the power of social tradition which makes students of human social behavior confident that the possibilities of social adjustment and social achievement have not yet been explored . A family , a football team , or a regiment may , through the power of its traditions , shape and mold the behavior of its individual units , even though the personnel of a group changes . Thus one key to social adjustment is group tradition . The same human group may take on ways of barbarism or of high civilization , may become autocratic and militaristic , or democratic and peaceful , according to the social tradition which it accepts and fosters . Human groups are generally careful to preserve and pass along their traditions , because this is the surest way of preserving the acquired uniformities of social behavior . Sometimes traditions are passed along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // toms . Thus it might be doubted if the traditions of Christianity and democracy , for example , have ever been adequately embodied in the corresponding customs in our social life . We must remember that traditions are embodied in words and that sometimes words fail to result in appropriate actions . Empty traditions , if we may so term them , are possible in human groups . A more frequent danger in group traditions , however , is when they become hard and fast and unchangeable . This brings about a state of society which we may call " traditionalism " ; that is , human groups may be so much in favor of certain traditions as to oppose any change in the ideas , sentiments , or values which underlie government , law , religion , morals , or education , no matter how rational the proposed change may be . Inflexible traditions are very manifestly a danger to the social group in which they exist , for change is the law of life for groups as well as for individuals . Therefore , while all human societies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this holds for all their institutions . Perhaps science has given us the best example of how to proceed in this matter ; for science , while it adheres to all the truth which has been established in the past , yet looks forward to the discovery of new truth and new knowledge which will enable man to make superior adjustments with his environment and with his fellow men . The social tradition is so potent in determining group behavior that some sociological writers have called group tradition , plus public Pinion , " the group mind . " The word " mind " however , had better reserved for the mental processes of the individual . The Learning Process in Human Society. ? It has been implied that the higher forms of social behavior in human groups are deterined largely by what the group has learned . Educational psychologists recognize three main forms of learning by individuals : by conditioning responses , whether impulsive or habitual ; by imitation ; tied finally by insight . These are the three types of learning by individuals , and , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , human groups learn mainly , as we have seen , by // intercommunication . Animals learn by the sensory and muscular exploration of objects . But man 's main method of learning seems to be learning from other members of his group through some form of intercommunication , especially verbal language . In ordinary speech we call this " learning from others . " All the customs and traditions of human groups are learned in this way , and these customs and traditions constitute the bulk of all that is learned by human beings . Human beings learn , in other words , not so much by doing or even by private concrete experience , as by intercommunication and social imagination . As learning accumulates in human groups and is stored in language in its various forms and in other symbols , it becomes the basis of tradition and custom , and so of the whole rule of life for the groups of mankind . Such " interlearning " among the members of human groups becomes in mankind the main factor in his cultural and social life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Through such " interlearning " it is possible for groups of men to profit from the experience , the inventions , and the discoveries of a single individual . Thus social leadership becomes very important in guiding human social behavior . Unless we remember this principle of learning from others and especially from leaders , we shall scarcely be able to understand the behavior of human groups or to get a foundation for a constructive sociology , constructive educational theory , and constructive social science in general . As human society secures its development through a learning process , this is the reason why human social behavior is modifiable , and why we have reason to believe that there are possibilities of indefinite improvement in that behavior . However , it is well to remember that human groups , like individuals , may commit errors by learning to act unwisely . Social Control. ? Human societies undertake more or less consciously to shape and mould the habits , the desires , the beliefs , and the ideals of their members , so that their activities may be easily and advantageously co-ordinated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is called " social control . " Except in its simplest forms , group // action is impossible without some degree of control by the group over the individual . Human societies , therefore , show the phenomena of authority and of social discipline . If individual behavior varies too greatly from the standards of the group , the individual is punished . From childhood to the grave the individual is surrounded by social rewards and penalties to get him to conform his behavior to that of his group . This is done through a number of agencies and institutions which exert upon the individual what has been called " social pressure . " These agencies of control may be classified under such heads as government , law , religion , moral ideals , and education , but we should not forget group opinion and social ostracism . In high civilization these agencies and institutions are the chief means of controlling the activities of individuals , and they probably have more to do with the formation of the habits and ideas of individuals in highly civilized groups than all other influences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , order and unity in vast complex human groups is achieved through institutional authority and pressure and through other specialized agencies for social control . The Original Factors in Human Relations. ? Let us now briefly reconsider what has been said in this and in the preceding chapter about the active factors or forces which enter into and affect human relations . From the start , even in the most primitive times , these factors were complex . The evolutionary point of view makes it impossible to leave out physical and biological factors . There were also original psychical factors at work even in the earliest human groups , such as hereditary impulses , the primary emotions , and primary intellectual elements . These have continued to work , as we have seen , even in present human relations . They have , however , been overlaid , and to a great extent controlled , by more complex factors or forces , usually derived from the culture of the group . Hence in interpreting definite human group behavior , the sociologist must always keep in the background these original social forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the emotional , and the primary intellectual cements. // The original factors in human relations , then , are those furnished by physical nature and original human nature . The derived factors are compounded out of these simple original factors , and most of them are products of human culture . The original factors may be classified as follows : I. The physical factors : ( a ) Geographic environment , including climate , food , soil , natural resources , topography , etc. ( b ) Biological forces , heredity , variation , selection , etc . II . The psychical factors : ( a ) Impulses , both hereditary ( instinctive ) and acquired ( habitual ) . ( b ) Feelings , both hereditary ( emotions ) and acquired ( habitual ) . ( c ) Intellectual elements , including sensation , perception , and ideation ( conception , imagination , reasoning , etc . ) The Derived Social Forces. ? In the past there has been much discussion among sociologists as to the nature of social forces and their classification . The word " force " belongs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in the social sciences , as it implies a false analogy . Many sociologists have found the determining factors in human association to be the " desires " or " wishes " of human individuals . Thus Professor W. I. Thomas finds that there are four fundamental desires which characterize all men and which he thinks are adequate to explain human social behavior . These four fundamental desires are : ( I ) the desire for new experience , ( 2 ) the desire for security , ( 3 ) the desire for recognition , ( 4 ) and the desire for response . These " desires " or " wishes " hardly furnish an exhaustive list of fundamental universal human wishes . Moreover , for the most part , they need to be explained . So far as they are not original human impulses , they are largely products of culture , and this is true of most human desires and wishes , which are compounded mainly out of feelings and impulses , frequently modified by cultural conditions . Explanations of // human social behavior through human desires , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be superficial and inadequate , because such explanation fails to see how the desires of the individual may be rooted in the culture of his group . Practically the same is to be said about explanations of human social Ix ? havior in terms of the " interests " and " values " of human individuals . These are compounds built up out of feelings , impulses , and intellectual elements , but such feelings , impulses , and intellectual elements of individuals may be greatly modified by the culture of the coup . The same thing is to be said of the " sentiments , " which are triplexes of feelings attached to some idea or object , and of enduring ial attitudes which have been built up out of feelings , impulses , and abits . All of these are true factors in human relations and supply onnally the motives for the reflective activities of civilized man . trough them the original psychic factors of impulses , feelings , and telligence usually express themselves . Many classifications of social values and interests have been prop iced . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ractical necessity in a discussion of the activities and institutions of uman society . The late Professor Small proposed the following sixteen classification of social interests and values : ( I ) health interests ; s ) wealth or economic interests ; ( 3 ) political and sociability interests ; 4 ) intellectual or scientific interests ; ( 5 ) aesthetic interests ; ( 6 ) moral ml religious interests . This classification does roughly indicate the ? tin activities and pursuits of human groups . It is a sociological classification rather than a psychological one . Alost important of all classifications of active factors in civilized human ioc iety is the classification into material culture and nonmaterial , or spiritual , culture . Material culture includes all the modifications of the srographic environment created by human intelligence , such as tools , machines , roads , buildings , etc . This technological environment fiixlilies and conditions all of the social behavior of civilized man , and et present furnishes many of the most potent stimuli and difficult roblems involved in human social behavior. // But equally potent and important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such agencies and institutions as govern-ment , law , art , science , religion , morality , and education . The com-plexes of institutional stimuli which are found under these heads furnish many of the chief factors to which attention must be paid in explaining human social behavior , and they will frequently concern us in the discussion of social problems . Summary. ? Social life is made up of adaptations between individuals , of coadaptations of individuals and groups to one another . But the master device for controlling the complex adaptations of life is the mind ; hence mind is also the chief instrument for maintaining and perfecting that complex of adaptations between individuals and groups which is our social life . Human society is the creation of the mind of man and is therefore modifiable . Intercommunication is the chief means of making interadjustments between individuals and groups , just as the mind is the chief organ of adaptation in the individual . Hence all phases of social and mental life are intertwined . Back of these , however , we must recognize the physical and biological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to practical use must show the significance of the various mental factors for our social life ; for it is these factors which can be most easily modified and controlled . CHAPTER IV PRIMARY GROUPS : THE FUNCTION OF THE FAMILY IN HUMAN SOCIETY Types of Social Groups. ? We may conveniently distinguish bet ween different types of social groups or " forms of association . " There is first of all the distinction between temporary and permanent groups . It is evident that the permanent groups are more important both practically and for the purposes of scientific study . The temporary groups , moreover , are usually parts of larger permanent groups . Another distinction which should be made is that between voluntary , purposive groups and involuntary , genetic groups . The former are found only in human society and are associations of persons for special purposes , such as parties , religious sects , trade unions , industrial corporations , clubs , and the like . The latter are natural groupings , such as the family , the neighborhood , the city , the state or province , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , called communities , since they are composed of individuals who carry on all phases of a common life . Voluntary , purposive associations always exist within some community , whether large or small . Groups which we call " communities " are , therefore , more embracing , more stable , less artificial and specialized than purely voluntary groups . For this reason communities are of more interest to the sociologist than specialized voluntary groups , and sociology is in a peculiar sense a study of the problems of community life . A still more important distinction between groups for sociological purposes is that between primary and secondary groups . ? ary groups are those which involve more or less intimate , face-to-face , personal relations . Such are the family , the neighborhood , and the play group . Secondary groups , on the other hand , are those which do 75 // not necessarily involve face-to-face association . Such are the state , the nation , the political party , and the religious sect . They are secondary because they are not original but are the creations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , are found in all stages of human development . They are of most interest sociologically , because they exhibit social life at its maximum intensity , and because they are the bearers of the most vital elements in social life , especially the traditions of civilization . Another very important distinction for sociological purposes among the forms of human association is that between the sanctioned , or institutional , and the unsanctioned , or noninstitutional , forms . Those groupings and relations of individuals which have been reflected upon , approved , and established , or instituted , by a large community we call institutions . Such are the family , property , the state , the church , and the school . As institutions are dependent on reflective thought and organized authority , they are not found , in the strict sense , below the human level . Their extreme importance in human society is indicated by the fact that they are forms of association which have been reflected upon , sanctioned , and established by human communities . They embody the chief consciously recognized values in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions in their relations to the social life . To begin our study of sociology it is evident that we should have , if possible , a more or less permanent , natural , group which is at the same time both a primary group and an institution . There is one such group in human society ? the family . It is for this reason that the family is selected as the group with which to begin our study of the concrete problems of human society ? because it illustrates in a simple way so many phases of social life . Many sociologists would begin with some other social group , such as the nation or the neighborhood ; but the nation is not a primary group and is too large and complex to begin with . However , much can be said for beginning the study of human relations with the study of the neighborhood or the local community . // The family group , in normal life , can exist only in a neighborhood or local community . As a social group the family is not entirely selfsufficing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universally characteristic of mankind , there must be other families for intermarriage . Moreover , many social relations , such as those of kinship , for example , can arise only when there is a group of families living together . Nevertheless , human family life presents many of the traits of human society in miniature . Social interaction in the family can be easily observed . As a primary group , the family , in both its biological and its psychological constitution , illustrates the working of the main forces in human social groups . If we remember that the family as an institution is almost always found in the community , we shall find this primary group most fruitful for the understanding of all human relations . It is , moreover , the primary group with which the beginning student in sociology is probably most familiar . It is possible to begin sociological study with other primary groups , but sociology should begin with the study of primary groups , not only because they are familiar to the student , but because they help us to understand best the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family , for example , furnishes clear illustrations of the forces involved in social origins , social development , and social organization . But let us now note the social functions of primary groups in general . The Social Functions of Primary Groups. ? ( x ) The intimate , face-to-face groups of men have always been the chief medium for the development of human social life ; for in them social life is most vividly realized . They form the natural environment for the development of the social traits of the individual . Psychologically the stimulus of the presence of other individuals seems necessary for the development of those instincts , habits , feelings , ideas , and standards which make for social unity . Hence the primary groups are the chief means for socializing the individual . ( 2 ) The face-to-face association of primary groups , moreover , is the chief means of preserving and passing along the social tradition ? that is , the knowledge , ideas , and values handed down from the past ? which is // the essential part of culture . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social tradition , such as schools , libraries , and museums , yet the continuity of the social life on its psychic side would be very imperfect if society had to depend on such specialized institutions . The primary groups are the chief bearers of culture or the social tradition , because they furnish the environment of the child from its earliest years . In them the child learns his language , and with his language he gets the fundamental knowledge , beliefs , and standards of his civilization . Moreover , the meaning of essential traditions is clearer to the young in these groups , because they are accompanied usually by the actual behavior correlated with the traditions . Hence , objectively , primary groups are also the main carriers of custom , in the sense of sanctioned habits of behavior . A certain tradition regarding government or morality , for example , when accompanied by observable actions , can be gotten by the child better than he can get it from the printed page or even the spoken word . ( 3 ) The chief significance of primary groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the source of primary social ideals . They furnish the " patterns " which we attempt to realize in our social life in general . Thus Professor Cooley says we get our notions of love , freedom , justice , and the like from such simple and widespread forms of society , since " in these relations mankind realizes itself , gratifies its primary needs , in a fairly satisfactory manner , and from the experience forms standards of what it is to expect from more elaborate association . " he adds that the ideals of both democracy and Christianity have sprung naturally from the primary groups . The very ideal of social solidarity itself comes from the unity experienced in such groups . Now , all progress in civilization is essentially a following out and development of " patterns . " In the material realm , for example , we have been able to develop the steam engine and the flying machine by following out and improving certain patterns . So in social relations we get our primary patterns from the primary groups , and then strive to realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significance of // these groups for understanding the whole development of human society and of civilization . The Family as a Primary Group. ? The family is the simplest group in human society capable of maintaining itself . It is in an especial sense , therefore , the primary social group . As its members , husband and wife , parents and children , have their places largely fixed in the group by their organic natures and relations , the family seems to be almost as much a biological structure as a social group . For this reason it presents especially clearly the biological forces operating in our social life . The family is not a product of other forms of association , but rather furnishes the possibilities of these . Containing as it does both sexes and all ages , it is not only capable of reproducing itself and society , but of illustrating and developing practically all essential human relationships . Thus the relations of superiority , subordination , and equality , which enter so largely into all social organization , are illustrated in the family in the relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of parents to each other , and of children to one another . Indeed , all essential relations of social interdependence are so fully illustrated in the family that it has often been justly called " society in miniature . " For this reason the work of the family in the social life has often been compared to that of the cell in the biological organism . Without pushing this analogy , however , it is evident that families do enter very largely as units into our social and industrial life , and we shall see that the character of our social life is very largely determined by the functioning of the family . The full evidence for this conclusion can be given only through the consideration of the origin , historical development , and present condition of the family ; but a brief survey of the functions of the family in human society will suffice to show it to be the most important of human institutions . We shall consider these functions under three heads . ThePrimary Function of the Family is continuing the life of the species ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sense of the birth and rearing of children . While other functions 8o PRIMARY GROUPS of the family have been delegated in a large measure to other social institutions , it is manifest that this function can not be so delegated . We know of no human society in which the birth and rearing of children has not been the essential function of the family . In present society , at least , the stream of life must flow through the family . The constitution of the family , therefore , determines the heredity of the child as well as its care and upbringing . If the family performed no other function than this of producing the new individuals of society and furnishing them physical care and nurture until maturity is reached , it would still be the most important of all human institutions . From a sociological point of view the childless family must be judged a failure . While the childless family may be of social utility to the individuals that form it , nevertheless from the point of view of society such a family has failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , to that extent socially a failure . The Function of the Family in Conserving Social Possessions. ? The family is still the chief institution in society for transmitting from one generation to another social possessions of all sorts , and , therefore , of conserving the social order . Property in the form of land or houses or personal property , society permits the family to pass along from generation to generation . Even the material equipment for industry , that is , capital , is so transmitted in present society . Thus under present conditions the child gets its material possessions , its economic equipment , for its start in life mainly from its family group . While this transmission by the family of the material goods of society from one generation to another is obviously of the highest social importance , even more important is its function of transmitting the spiritual possessions of the race . The family is the chief bearer of social tradition , because the child gets its language mainly in the family ; and in language is embodied all the beliefs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , law , religion , morality , the family , and general social life . The Family as a School . So completely does the child get his essential social traditions from the family , that many educators hold that // t lie most essential things in social education can never be given in the public schools , but must be given in the home . This is especially true of religious and moral instruction . The real foundations of moral character are laid while the child is yet of preschool age in the family circle . In the family the child first learns the meaning of authority , obedience , loyalty , love , service , and all the human virtues . If the child fails to get proper moral standards and ideals from his family life , he gets them with greater difficulty , if at all , from society later . The same is true regarding political ideas and standards . If the child fails to learn in his family life loyalty to his country , respect for law , and the ideals of good citizenship , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or unpatriotic elements of society later . Even habits of work must be learned by the child largely in the family . Thus the rudiments of morality , of religion , of government , of law , and even of industry are transmitted in the family and learned by the child in his family group . " I'he family , in brief , furnishes the immediate environment of the child of tender age . Thus it is charged by society not only with producing its new individuals but with training them in the most essential relations and values of life . It is the group which has the greatest power to socialize the individual and to adjust him to the requirements even of a high civilization . If it fails to perform this important task , the chances are that unsocialized individuals will *bound , and that social anarchy will sometime replace social order . Thus the family is the great conserving agency in society to preserve social order and to transmit from generation to generation both the material and the spiritual possessions of the race . The Function of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family in social life are very obvious , the part which it plays in social progress has often been overlooked and even denied . Now , social progress , we shall see later , depends mainly upon two things : the accumulation of knowledge and the accumulation of altruism ? regard for others ? in society . It is , of course , through the latter that the family life plays a part in social progress . // The family is the chief generator of altruism in society , and increasing altruism is necessary for the success of those more and more complex forms of co-operation which characterize higher civilization and upon which it depends . It is chiefly in the family that children learn to ) ove , to be of service , to sacrifice for others , and to respect one an19ther 's rights . If the family fails to teach the spirit of service and selfsacrifice to its members , it is hardly probable that they will get much of that spirit from society at large . The amount of altruism in society , therefore , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . Family affection is the natural root of altruism in society at large . As the family life is the chief teacher of altruism to the individual , and as society depends upon increasing altruism for each forward step in moral progress , so the family life plays a most important part in social progress . There is another way also in which the altruism and solidarity of the family play a most important part in social evolution . All human history has , from one point of view , been a struggle to transfer the altruism and solidarity of the family to successively larger and larger groups of men . In other words , as we have already seen , the family is the primary group which has furnished the main moral " patterns " which society at large has set before itself as its goal . Our primary social ideals , in the main , come from the family . Thus the ideal of human brotherhood is manifestly derived from the family . So also are the ideals of love , service , self-sacrifice for the sake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . higher civilization has set these ideals , which the family life has furnished , before it as the goals of progress . Thus we have a brief presentation of the claim of the family to be regarded not only as the primary , but also as the most important institution of human society . While primarily its function is the birth and proper rearing of children , yet in performing this function it has become the chief medium for carrying and nourishing the essential values of civilization . It has been the cradle of civilization in the past , and something like its organization at best seems to be the normal goal which men set up for society at large to realize . The nation whose // family life decays , therefore , rots at the core ; for its chief spring of cial and civic virtue dries up . he Family and Modern Industry. ? The family is so dependent upon industrial conditions in performing its functions , and industrial conditions so react upon the family life , that a word must be said about the interactions of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the family as a human institution . The Domestic Arts . Primitively all industry centered in the family . Modern industry is but an enormous expansion of primitive housekeeping ; that is , the preparation of food and clothing and shelter by the primitive family group for its own existence is the germ out of which all modern industry has developed . The very word economics means the science or the art of the household . In primitive communities and in new settled districts the family often carried on all essential industrial activities . It produced all the raw material , manufactured the finished products , and consumed the same . This development of household arts greatly aided the development of human culture and at the same time integrated the family , as it made the family a more or less self-sufficing economic unit . The family was in this stage of social and industrial development a more complete miniature society or community , and the tradition grew up that these domestic arts must be maintained in the home if the family was to retain its integrity . But with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great industrial division of labor , and the family has delegated industrial activity after activity to some other institution until at the present time the modern family performs scarcely any industrial activities , except the preparation of food for immediate consumption . Even this in modern cities seems about to be delegated to some other institution . All that need be said at present about the delegation of the industrial activities of the family to other industrial institutions is that the movement is not one which need cause any anxiety so long as it does not interfere with the essential function of the family , namely , the // birth and proper rearing of children . Even though children can no longer learn the domestic arts and the rudiments of industry in their home life , still it is possible through manual , industrial , and domestic science training in our public schools to teach these to all children . And the removal of arts and industries from the home , even such essential industries as the preparation of food , is not to be regarded as necessarily evil . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parents , especially to the mother , for the proper care and bringing up of the children . The Wages of Men . This removal of industries from the home , however , while theoretically to be welcomed , has in practice under present economic conditions not always had the beneficent effect of giving more time to parents for the proper care of their children and of securing a better home life . On the contrary , the removal of industries from the home has often been followed by the removal of both parents and children , the rendering of the family 's economic situation precarious , and the practical disintegration of home life . The wages of the male worker outside of the home have too often tended to conform to the single man 's standard , though government statistics show that the earnings of the husband constitute 8o per cent of the total income of the average wage-earner 's family in the United States . Thus the Federal Census Bureau states that in 1939 the median income from wages of male wage earners in the United States that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that the least income on which a family consisting of two parents and three young children could maintain a decent standard of living was , for large cities , $1700 to $1900 a year , and for smaller cities from $1200 to $1500 a year . The National Resources Committee showed that for one year ( in 1935 ? 36 ) the average income for wage-earning families in the United States was $1289 , but that from $11oo to $1400 , according to locality , was necessary in our cities to maintain a decent standard of living for a family of five . Evidently modern industry has been quite regardless of the family , and has in many instances made it very difficult to maintain a proper home life . // The Labor of Women . This has been all the more the case because in many instances married women , often mothers , have gone into factories to supplement the insufficient income of the family . Under such circumstances the home has often become a mere lodging place , children have been neglected and allowed to grow up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women wage earners formed 24.3 per cent of the total breadwinners in the United States . Of the over eleven million women wage earners , 2,322,252 were employed in manufacturing industries . About 37 per cent of all the women at work for wages in 1940 were married , and the number of married women so employed had quadrupled since 1900 . In foreign countries the proportion is much larger . It is too late to stop this movement , but the labor of married women should be strictly regulated by the state . They should be excluded from certain industries , their hours of labor , wages , and conditions of work should be prescribed , and above all , their employment for a given period before and after the birth of children should be prohibited ; for it has been found that wherever mothers of very young children are employed outside of the home , there is an abnormally high rate of infant mortality . Even the labor of young unmarried women in factories has many dangers to the family ; for they are by such work but poorly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some cases their health may be impaired . These evils can be met , however , by greater attention to education in the domestic arts in our schools and by stricter regulation of the conditions of the labor of women by the state in all respects . The Labor of Children . Perhaps the climax of the encroachment of modern industry upon the home comes when it takes young children out of the home and puts them to work . As late as 1930 three quarters of a million children under fifteen years of age were employed in the United States outside of their families , though only about one fourth of these were in factories , shops , stores , and mines . The labor of liildren outside of the home sprang very largely from the insuffi86 PRIMARY GROUPS ciency of family income noted above . While child labor is often defended as having the merit of giving the child some industrial training , yet careful and extensive investigations show that its net result is to dwarf the child in body and mind , to lower the wages of adults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that education which alone can prepare him for efficient citizenship . The drafting of children who have not yet completed their work in the grades into industry must be regarded , therefore , as altogether an evil . Hence a Federal law passed in 1938 forbids the labor of children in industries engaged in interstate trade . The remedy for these evils is not to put industrial work back in the home . That , under modern conditions , produces what is called " the sweat shop , " which is perhaps a worse evil than any above described . The remedy is rather in so organizing industry that it will not needlessly encroach upon our family life ? in securing adequate wages , reasonable hours , wholesome conditions of work in industry . This means that our industry must be organized about our family life rather than our family life about industry . The Subordination of Industry to Family Life is necessary , therefore , from a social point of view . Industry , as we have seen , was primitively an adjunct of family life , and all modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjunct to family life . Industrial considerations must be , therefore , subordinate to domestic considerations , that is , to considerations of the welfare of parents and their children in the family group . One trouble with modern society is that industry has come to dominate as an independent interest that oftentimes does not recognize its reasonable and socially necessary subordination to the higher interests of society . There can be no sane and stable family life until we are willing to subordinate the requirements of industry to the requirements of the family for the good birth and proper rearing of children . This means that the securing of a normal family life for all classes , rather than mere economic prosperity , should be the first consideration in all attempts at social reconstruction . But the full significance of a normal family life // for human welfare and how it can be secured will be evident only when we have considered the origin , history , and present condition of the family . Summary. ? Primary , or face-to-face , groups are the key to the understanding of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its maxi-mum . They perform three chief functions : ( I ) they socialize the in-dividual ; ( 2 ) they are the chief carriers of custom and tradition ; ( 3 ) they are the source of primary social ideals or " social patterns . " The family is the chief primary group and the most important of human institutions , since it controls largely the birth and the rearing of children . Because the family involves such a close association of both sexes and all ages and enlists so many of the forces that make or mar social life , it illustrates the problem of human relations ? the " social problem " ? in the clearest possible manner . Therefore , the understanding of the origin and historical development of the family is necessary for the understanding of present human society in gen-eral . The good and evil of the family life are sure to reflect themselves throughout society . If what has been said regarding the importance of the family as an institution is true , then it is evident that the securing of a normal family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific social reconstruction . All that is involved in a " normal family life " will become evident , however , only as we proceed to the survey of all of our social problems . CHAPTER V THE ORIGIN OF THE FAMILY WE must understand the biological roots of the family before we can understand the family as an institution , and especially before we can understand its origin . Let us note , then , briefly the chief biological facts connected with family life . The Biological Foundations of the Family. ? ( t ) The Family rests upon the Great Biological Fact of Sex . While sex does not characterize all animal forms , still it does characterize all except the simplest forms of animal life . These simplest forms multiply or reproduce by fission , but such asexual reproduction is almost entirely confined to the unicellular forms of life . It may be inferred , therefore , that the higher animal types could not have been evolved without sexual reproduction , and something of the meaning or significance of sex in the whole life-process will , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolution . Biologists tell us that the meaning or purpose of sexual reproduction is to bring about greater organic variation . Now variation , as we have seen , is the raw material upon which natural selection acts to create the higher types . The immense superiority of sexual reproduction over asexual reproduction is due to the fact that it multiplies so greatly the elements of heredity in each new organism , for under sexual reproduction every new organism has two parents , four grandparents , and so on , each of which perhaps contributes something to its heredity . The biological meaning of sex , then , is that it is a device of nature to bring about organic variation . From the point of view of the social life we may note also that sex adds greatly to its variety , enriching it with numerous fruitful variations which undoubtedly further social evolution . The bareness and monotony of a social life without sex can readily be imagined . 90 // While the differences between the sexes have been mainly elabo-rated through the differences of reproductive function , yet these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the organism . In the higher animals , therefore , the sexes differ profoundly in many ways from each other . Biologists tell us that the chief differ-ence between the male and the female organism is a difference in metabolism , that is , in the rapidity of chemical change which goes on within the body . In the male metabolism is much more rapid than in the female ; hence the male organism is said to be more catabolic . In the female the rapidity of chemical change is less ; hence the female is said to be more anabolic . Put in more familiar terms , the male tends to expend energy , is more active , hence also stronger ; the female tends more to store up energy , is more passive , conservative , and weaker . These fundamental differences between the sexes express themselves in many ways in the social life . The differences between man and woman , therefore , are not to be thought of as due simply to social customs and usages , the different social environment of the two sexes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference in their whole nature . The belief that the two sexes would become like each other in character if given the same environment is , there-fore , erroneous . That sex differences are often inborn , and not ac-quired , may be readily seen by observing children of different sex . Even from their earliest years boys are more active , restless , energetic , destructive , untidy , and disobedient , while little girls are quieter , less restless , less destructive , neater , more orderly , and more obedient . These different innate qualities fit the sexes naturally for different functions in human society , and there is , therefore , a natural division of labor between them , which indeed may be said to be the funda-mental division of labor in human society . The causes which produce sex in the individual are probably beyond the control of man . Sex seems to be a form of Mendelian inheritance , ' and is determined by the nature of the germ cells which unite to form the new individual . While the number of the two sexes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factors , in practically all of the higher species , man included , they are relatively equal . In human society much depends upon this relative numerical equality of the two sexes . Hence it is fortunate that man does not know how to control the sex of offspring , for if he did the numerical equality of the two sexes might be disturbed and serious social results would follow . ( 2 ) The Influence of Parental Care . Sex alone could never have produced the family in the sense of a relatively permanent group of parents and offspring . We do not begin to find the family until we get to those higher types where we find some parental care . In the lowest types the relation between the sexes is momentary and the survival of offspring is secured simply through the production of enormous numbers . Thus the sturgeon , a low type of fish , produces between one and two million eggs at a single spawning , from which it is estimated that not more than a dozen individuals survive till maturity is reached . Thus sexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could give rise in no way to the family ; but quite low in the scale of life we begin to find some parental care as a device to protect immature offspring and secure their survival without the expenditure of such an enormous amount of energy in mere physiological reproduction . Even among the fishes we find some that watch over the eggs after they are spawned , and care for their young by leading them to suitable feeding grounds . In such cases a much smaller number of young need to be produced in order that a few may survive until maturity is reached . In the mammals the mother , obviously , must care for the young for some time , since mammals arc animals that suckle their young . But this care of the young by a single parent only foreshadows the family as we understand it . Among the mammals it is not until we reach the higher types that we find care of offspring by both parents , ? a practice , however , which is common among the birds . It is evident that as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the offspring they have a much better chance of survival . Hence , natural selection favors the growth of this type of group life and develops powerful instincts to keep male and female // i ogether till after the birth and rearing of offspring . Such we find too be the condition among many of the higher mammals , such as some of the carnivora , and especially among the monkeys and apes and man . If it is allowable at this point to generalize from the facts given , it must be said that family life is essentially a device of nature for the preservation of offspring through a more or less prolonged infancy . The family group and the instincts upon which it rests were undoubtedly , therefore , instituted by natural selection . Summing up , then , the animal family group owes its existence , first , to the production of child or immature forms that need more or less prolonged care ; secondly , to the prolongation of this period of immaturity in the higher animals , and especially in man ; thirdly , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instincts which keep male and female together for the care of the offspring . It is evident , then , that the family life rests , not upon sex attraction , but upon the ct of the child and the corresponding psychological fact of parental instinct . The family , then , has been created by the very conditions of life itself and is not a man-made institution . The Origin of the Family in the Human Species . ? Two great theories of the origin of the family in the human species have in the past been more or less accepted , and these we must now examine and criticize : first , the traditional theory that the human family life was from the beginning a pure monogamy ; secondly , the so-called evolutionary theory that the human family life arose from confused if not promiscuous sex relations . The first of these theories , favored both by the Bible and by Aristotle , held undisputed sway down to the middle of the nineteenth century . Then , after the publication of Darwin 's Origin of Species in 1859 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the name of evolution . In order that we may see precisely what the origin of the human family life was , and its primitive form , we must now proceed to criticize these two theories , especially the last , which is known as the hypothesis of a primitive state of promiscuity. // The Habits of the Higher Animals . We have already considered the origin of the family group in the animal world generally , but it must be admitted that there are some difficulties in arguing directly from the lower animals to man . Man is so separated from the lower animals by having passed through many higher stages of an independent evolution that in many respects his life is peculiar to itself . This is true especially of his family life . If we survey the whole range of animal life and then the whole range of human life , we find that there are but two or three striking similarities between the family life of man and that of the brutes , but a great many striking dissimilarities . The similarities may be summed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals the phenomena of courtship , that is , of the male seeking to win the female , also the phenomenon of male jealousy , and we may perhaps add an instinctive aversion to crossing with other species . These characteristics of his family life man shares with the brutes below him . There are , however , many things peculiar to the human family life that are found in no animal species below man . The most striking of these differences may be mentioned . ( i ) Man has no pairing season , as practically all other animals have . ( 2 ) The number of young born in the human species is on the whole much smaller than in any other animal species . ( 3 ) The dependence of offspring upon parents is far longer in the human species than in any other species . ( 4 ) Man has an antipathy to incest or close inbreeding which seems to be instinctive . This is not found clearly in any animal species below man . ( 5 ) There is a tendency among human beings to artificial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural ornament to any extent , as among many animal species . ( 6 ) The indorsement of society is almost invariably sought , both among uncivilized and civilized peoples , before the establishment of a new family ? usually through the forms of a religious marriage ceremony . ( 7 ) Chastity in married women is universally insisted upon , as the basis of human family life ; and among higher civilized peoples there is equal insistence upon the chastity of women before marriage . ( 8 ) There is a feeling of modesty // or of shame as regards matters of sex among the human beings . ( 9 ) In humanity we find , besides animal lust , spiritual affection , or love , as a bond of union between the two sexes . None of these peculiarities of human family life are found in the family life of any animal species below man . It might seem , therefore , that man 's family life must be regarded as a special creation unconnected with the family life of the brutes below him . But this view is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of evolution . We must say that these peculiarities of human family life are to be explained through the fact that man has passed through many more stages of evolution , particularly of intellectual evolution , than any of the animals below him . If we examine these peculiarities of man 's family life carefully , we find that they all can be explained through natural selection and the cultural evolution of man . That man has no pairing season , has fewer offspring born , and a longer period of dependence of the offspring upon parents , and the like , is directly to be explained through natural selection ; while seeking the indorsement of society before forming a new family , sexual modesty , tendencies to artificial adornment , and the like , are to be explained through man 's self-consciousness and higher intellectual development , also through the fuller development of his social life . The gap between the human family life and brute family life is , therefore , not an unbridgeable one . That this is so , we see most clearly when we consider the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cousins in the animal world . All of these apes , of which the chief representatives are the gorilla , orangutan , and the chimpanzee , live in relatively permanent family groups , usually monogamous . These family groups are almost human in many of their characteristics , such as the care which the male parent gives to the mother and her offspring , and the seeming affection which exists between all members of the group . Such a group of parents and offspring among the higher apes is , moreover , a relatively permanent affair , children of different ages being frequently found along with their parents in such groups . So far as the evidence of // animals next to man , therefore , goes , there is no reason for supposing that the human family life sprang from confused or promiscuous sex relations in which no permanent union between male and female parent existed . On the contrary , there is every reason to believe , with Westermarck , that human family life is an inheritance from man 's prehuman progenitor . The . Evidence from the Lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in point of culture even more clearly , if anything , refutes the hypothesis of a primitive state of promiscuity . The habits or customs of the lowest peoples were not well known previous to the nineteenth century . Therefore it was possible for such a theory as the patriarchal theory of the primitive family to remain generally accepted , even by most scientists , down to the middle of the nineteenth century . This was the theory that the oldest or most primitive type of human family life is that depicted in the opening pages of the Book of Genesis , namely , a family life in which the father or eldest male of the family group is the absolute ruler of the group and practically owner of all persons and property . The belief that this was the primitive type of the human family life was first attacked by a German-Swiss philologist by the name of Bachofen in a work entitled Das Mutterrecht ( The Matriarchate ) , published in 1861 , in which he argued that antecedent to the patriarchal period was a matriarchal period , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationships were traced through mothers only . Bachofen got his evidence for this theory from certain ancient legends , such as that of the Amazons , and other remains in Greek and Roman literature , which seemed to point to a period antecedent to the patriarchal . In 1877 Mr. Lewis H. Morgan , an American ethnologist and sociologist , put forth again , independently , practically the same theory , basing it upon an extensive study of the North American Indian tribes . Morgan had lived among the Iroquois Indians for years and had mastered their system of relationship , which previously had puzzled the whites . He found that they traced relationship // through mothers only , and not at all along the male line . This method of reckoning relationship , moreover , he found also character-ized practically all of the North American Indian tribes , and he argued that the only explanation of it was that originally sexual relations were of such an unstable or promiscuous character that they would not permit of tracing descent through fathers . From these theories sociological writers put forth the conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monogamy emerging only after intermediate stages of limited promiscuity , polyandry , and polygamy . A somewhat similar theory has lately been set forth by Robert Briffault in his monumental study of The Mothers . Before giving a criticism in detail of this theory let us note whether the evidence from the lowest peoples confirms it . The lowest peoples in point of culture are not the North American Indians nor the African Negroes , but certain isolated groups that live almost in a state of nature , without any attempt to cultivate the soil or to control nature in other respects . Such are the Bushmen of South Africa , the Australian aborigines , the Negritos of the Philippine Islands and of the Andaman ' Islands , the Veddas of Ceylon , and the Fuegians of South America . Now all these peoples , with a possible exception , ' practice monogamy and live in relatively stable family groups . Their monogamy , however , is not of the type found in patriarchal times or among civilized peoples , but is a simple pairing monogamy , husband and wife remaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if childless . Edward Vestermarck in his History of Human Marriage showed that nothing approaching promiscuity existed among these lower peoples . Promiscuity is apt to be found at a higher stage of social development , and is especially apt to be found among the nature peoples after the white man has visited them and demoralized their family life . But in all these cases the // existence of promiscuity is manifestly something exceptional and abnormal . Perhaps civilized peoples such as the Romans of the decadence have more nearly approximated the condition of promiscuity than any savage people of which we have knowledge . At any rate , the lowest existing savages found in the nineteenth century had definite forms of family life , and the type usually found was the simple pairing monogamy mentioned above . Objections to the Hypothesis of a Primitive State of Promiscuity. ? Let us now briefly sum up the main criticisms of this theory of a primitive state of promiscuity , not only as they may be derived from inductive study of the higher animals and the lower peoples , but also as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles . ( I ) In the first place , then , the animals that are most nearly similar to man , namely , the higher apes , do not show a condition of promiscuity. ( 2 ) The evidence from the lower peoples does not show that such a condition exists or has ever existed among them . ( 3 ) A third argument against this hypothesis may be gained from what we know of primitive economic conditions . Under the most primitive conditions , in which man had no mastery over nature , food supply was relatively scarce , and as a rule only very small groups of people could live together . The smallness of primitive groups , on account of the scarcity of food supply , would prevent anything like promiscuity on a large scale . ( 4 ) A fourth argument of a deductive nature is that the jealousy of the male , which characterizes all higher animals and especially man , would prevent anything like the existence of sexual promiscuity . The tendency of man would have been to appropriate one or more women for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argued that this would prevent anything like the existence of a general state of promiscuity. ( 5 ) A fifth argument against this theory may be got from the general biological fact that sexual promiscuity tends to pathological // conditions unfavorable to fecundity , that is , fertility , or the birth of offspring . Physicians have long ago ascertained this fact , and the modern prostitute gives illustration of it by the fact that she has few or no children . Among the lower animal species , in which some degree of promiscuity obtains , moreover , powerful instincts keep the sexes apart except at the pairing season . Now , no such instincts exist in man . Promiscuity in man would , therefore , greatly lessen the birth rate , and any group that practiced it to any extent would soon be eliminated in competition with other groups that did not practice it . ( 6 ) We have finally the general social fact that promiscuity would lead to the neglect of children . Promiscuity means that the male parent does not remain with the female parent to care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species it would mean that the care of children would be thrown wholly upon the mother . This means that the children would have less chance of surviving . Not only would promiscuity lead to lessening the birth rate , but it would lead to a much higher mortality in children born . This is found to be a striking fact wherever we find any degree of promiscuity among any people . Hence , promiscuity would soon exterminate any people that practiced it extensively in competition with other peoples that slid not practice it . From all of these lines of argument , without going over the evidence in greater detail , it seems reasonable to conclude with Westermarck " that the hypothesis of a primitive state of promiscuity has no foundation in fact and is essentially unscientific . " The facts put forth in support of the theory do not justify the conclusion , Westermarck says , that promiscuity has ever been a general practice among a single people and much less that it was the primitive state . Promiscuity is found , however , more or less in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more often , however , among the civilized than among the uncivilized , but among no people has it ever existed unqualified by more enduring forms-of sex r:zlation . Moreover , because promiscuity breaks up the social tonds , throws ioo THE ORIGIN OF THE FAMILY the burden of the care of children wholly upon the mother , and lessens the birth rate , we are justified in concluding that promiscuity is essentially an antisocial practice . This agrees with the facts generally shown by criminology and sociology , that the elements practicing promiscuity to any great extent in modern societies are those most closely related with the degenerate and criminal elements . Those elements , in other words , in modern society that practice promiscuity are on the road to extinction , and if a people generally were to practice it there is no reason to believe that such a people would meet with any different fate . The Earliest Form of Family Life in the Human Species , therefore , is probably that of the simple pairing monogamous family found among many of the higher animals , especially the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This primitive monogamy , however , as we have already seen , was not accompanied by the social , legal , and religious elements that the historic monogamic family has largely rested upon . On the contrary , this primitive monogamy rested solely upon an instinctive basis , and , as we have seen , unless children were born it was apt to be relatively unstable . Permanency in family relations among primitive peoples depended largely upon the birth of children . Thus we find confirmed our conclusion drawn some pages back that family life rests primarily upon instinctive tendencies connected with child care . That it still so rests is shown by the fact , as we shall see later , that divorce is many times more common among couples that have no children than among those that have children . Some General Sociological Conclusions have now become evident . The first is that the values of human society are in part biologically created . The biological processes of life have created the family group , and the family as an institution rests upon these biological processes . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they necessarily rest upon biological conditions , generally have corresponding to them certain fundamental instinctive tendencies . Not all human social organization is man-made . Therefore , OBJECTIONS TO HYPOTHESIS OF PROMISCUITY iot to attempt to reorganize human society regardless of the biological conditions of life , or regardless of fundamental human " instincts , " is to meet with certain failure . While human institutions can not be arbitrary , this is not saying that human institutions can not be modified by human intelligence . All culture is a result of man 's attempts to modify and control natural conditions and natural tendencies . But if the modification is to result in permanent human advantage , the conditions of life generally , and the fundamental emotions and instinctive drives of human nature , must be respected . The social order can not be made a matter of individual taste or of arbitrary caprice . We have seen that the family from primitive times has been the central institution of human society . It has been a device , partly instinctive , partly intelligent , to control the reproductive process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With this end it has attempted to regulate the relations of the sexes . Such control over the reproductive process has been one of the main aims of all social organization in the past , whether of savage peoples or of civilized peoples ; and upon this control over the birth and rearing of children practically the whole structure of moral civilization has been based . Two practical conclusions stand out in regard to the family . First , the control over the reproductive process which the family attempts evidently precludes the social toleration of promiscuity , or even of free love . Promiscuity , or even great instability in the family life , would seriously impair social control over the birth and rearing of children , and so would undermine the foundations of higher civilization . The second practical conclusion is , seeing that neither the state nor industry had to do with the origin of the family , but rather the biological requirements for human survival , neither the state nor industry may safely determine the form of the family . On the contrary , their interests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the securing of a normal family life , for the good birth and proper rearing of children in all classes . CHAPTER VI THE FORMS OF THE FAMILY THE family as an institution has varied greatly in its forms from age to age and from people to people . This is what we should expect , seeing that all organic structures are variable . Such variations in human institutions are due partly to the influences of the environment , partly to the state of knowledge , and partly to many other causes as yet not well understood . The family illustrates in greater or less degree the working of these causes of variation and of change in human institutions . As regards the general form of the family we have to note first of all the two great forms which we may characterize respectively as " the maternal family " and " the paternal family . " The Maternal or Metronymic Family. ? As we have already seen , Bachofen , Morgan , and others discovered a condition of human society in which relationship was traced through mothers only , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than along the male line . Further investigation and research have shown that up to recent times , say up to the early part of the nineteenth century , one half of all the peoples of the world , if we reckon them by nations and tribes rather than by numbers , practiced this system of reckoning kinship through mothers only , and passed property and authority down along the female line . Ethnologists and sociologists have practically concluded , from the amount of evidence now collected , that this maternal or metronymic system was the primitive system of tracing relationships , and that it was succeeded among the European peoples by the paternal system so long ago that the transition from the one to the other has been forgotten , except as some trace of it has been preserved in customs , legends , and the like . 104 // Among many tribes of the North American Indians this metronymic or maternal system was peculiarly well-developed . Children took their mother 's name , not their father 's name ; belonged to their mother 's clan , not their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if hereditary , not to his own son , but to his eldest sister 's son . The relatives on the father 's side , indeed , were quite ignored . Frequently the maternal uncle had more legal authority over the children than their own father , seeing that the children belonged to his clan , that is , to their mother 's clan . Now , Bachofen claimed not only that in this stage kinship was reckoned through mothers only , but that women were dominant socially and politically ; that there existed a true matriarchy , or rule of the mothers . Do the facts support Bachofen 's theory ? Let us see . The Wyandot Indians , a branch of the Iroquois , were a typical maternal or metronymic people . Among them , without any doubt , the women had a position of influence socially and even politically which often is not found among peoples of higher culture . For example , among the Wyandots the government of the clan was in the hands of four women councilors ( Matrons ) , who were elected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ councilors , however , elected a Peace Sachem , who carried out the will of the clan in all matters pertaining to peace generally . Moreover , the councilors of the several clans , four fifths of whom were women , met together to form the Tribal Council ; but in this Tribal Council the women sat separate , not participating in the deliberations , but exercising only a veto power on the decisions of the men . In matters of war , however , government was intrusted to two war chiefs elected from the tribe generally , the women here only having the right to veto the decision of the tribe to enter upon the warpath . Thus we see that while the women of the Iroquois Indians had a great deal of social and political influence , the actual work of government was largely turned over by them to the men , and especially was this true of directing the affairs of the tribe in time of war . There is no doubt , however , that in the maternal stage of social evolution women had an influence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and social matters much greater than they had at many later stages of social development . Among the Zuni of New Mexico , for example , another well-developed maternal people , marriage is always arranged by the bride 's parents . The husband goes to live with his wife , and is practically a guest in his wife 's house all his life long , she alone having the right of divorce . Indeed , among maternal peoples the rule is that the husband goes to live with the wife , and not the wife with the husband , the children , as we have already seen , keeping the mother 's name and belonging to her kindred or clan . Nevertheless there is no historic evidence to support Bachofen 's theory of the primitive maternal system being a true matriarchy , or government by women . On the contrary , among all of these maternal peoples , while the women may have much influence socially and politically , the men , on account of their superior strength , are intrusted with the work not only of protecting and providing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the work of maintaining the internal government and order of the people . Strictly speaking , therefore , there has never been a matriarchal stage of social evolution , but rather a maternal or metronymic stage . As we have already seen , this stage was probably the primitive one . Flow are we to explain , then , that primitive man reckoned kinship through mothers only ? Was this due , as Morgan thought , to . a primitive practice of promiscuity which prevented tracing relationships through fathers ? The reply is , that among the many maternal peoples now well known , among whom relationships are traced through mothers only , we find no evidence of the practice of general promiscuity now or even in remote times . The North American Indians , for example , had quite definite forms of family life and were very far removed from the practice of promiscuity , though they traced relationship through mothers only . It is evident that the causes of the maternal family and the maternal system of relationship are not so simple as Morgan supposed . What , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It is certain that man in the earliest times did not know the physiological connection between father and child . The physiological connection between mother and child , on the other hand , was an obvious fact which required no knowledge of physiology to establish ; therefore , nothing was more natural than for primitive man to recognize that the child was of the mother 's blood , but not of the father 's blood . Therefore , the child belonged to the mother 's people and not to the father 's people . If it be asked whether it is possible that there could be any human beings so ignorant that they do not know the physiological connection between father and child , the reply is , that this is apparently the case among a number of very primitive peoples , even down to recent times . It is not infrequent among these peoples to find conception and childbirth attributed to the influence of the spirits , rather than to relations between male and female . While , therefore , a social connection between the father and the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways for his children , as fathers do whether among civilized or among uncivilized peoples , yet the blood relationship between the father and the child could not have been clear in the most primitive times . Perhaps an even more efficient cause , however , of the maternal system was the fact that the mother in primitive times was the stable element in the family life , the constant center of the family . The husband was frequently away from home , hunting or fighting , and oftentimes failed to return .. Nothing was more natural , therefore , than that the child should be reckoned as belonging to the mother , take her name , and belong to her kindred or clan . Moreover , after the custom of naming children from mothers and reckoning them as belonging to the mother 's clan was established , it could not be displaced by the mere discovery of the physiological connection between the father and the child . On the contrary , social habits , like habits in the individual , tend to persist until they work badly . We find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for many generations had come fully to recognize the physiological io8 THE FORMS OF THE FAMILY connection of father and child . Indeed , the maternal system could never have been done away with if social evolution had not brought about new and complex conditions which caused the system to break down and to be replaced by the paternal system . The Paternal and the Patriarchal Family. ? At a certain stage , then , we find a great change in the organization of the family , which probably took place slowly and largely unconsciously . The family life becomes definitely organized about the male element , and the maternal system disappears . At first the paternal family appears with children taking the father 's name and property and titles passing along the male line . Then there develops that extreme form of the paternal family which we know as the patriarchal family , in which the authority of the husband and father has become supreme and the position of the wife and children has been reduced , if not to that of property , at least to that of subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in the pages of the Old Testament . What , then , were the causes which brought about the breakdown of the maternal system and the gradual development , first of a paternal , and then of a patriarchal system ? Some of these causes we can clearly make out from the study of social history . ( i ) War was unquestionably a cause of the breakdown of the maternal system through the fact that women were captured in war , held as slaves , and made wives or concubines by their captors . These captured wives were regarded as the property of the captor . Any children born to them were , therefore , also regarded as the property of the captor . Furthermore , these captured wives were separated from their kindred , and their children could not possibly belong to any clan except their husband 's . Manifestly this cause could not have worked in the earliest times , when slave captives were not valuable ; but as soon as slavery became instituted in any form , then women slaves were particularly valued , not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concubines or wives . It is evident , then , that war and slavery would thus indirectly tend to undermine the maternal system . // ( 2 ) Wife purchase would operate in the same way . Among peoples that had developed a commercial life as well as slavery it early became the practice to purchase wives . It is evident that these purchased wives would be regarded as a sort of property , and the husband would naturally claim the children as belonging to him . Among certain North American Indians we find exactly this state of affairs . If a man married a wife without paying the purchase price for her , then her children took her name and belonged to her clan ; but if he had purchased her , say with a number of blankets , then the children took his name and belonged to his clan . ( 3 ) The decisive cause , however , of the.breakdown of the maternal system was the development of the pastoral stage of industry . Now , the grazing of flocks and herds requires considerable territory and necessitates small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the pastoral stage the wife had to go with the husband and be far removed from the influence and authority of her own kindred . This gave the husband greater power over his wife . Moreover , the care of flocks and herds accentuated the value of the male laborer , while primitively woman had been the chief laborer . In the pastoral stage the man had the main burden of caring for the flocks and herds . Under such circumstances nothing was more natural than that the authority of the owner of the family property should gradually become supreme in all matters , and we find , therefore , among all pastoral peoples that the family is itself a little political unit , the children taking the father 's name , property and authority passing down along the male line , while the eldest living male is usually the ruler of the whole group . ( q ) After all these causes came another factor ? ancestor worship . While ancestor worship exists to some extent among maternal peoples , it is usually not well-developed for some reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worship , ' being the worship of the departed ancestors as heroes , seems to develop more readily where the line of ancestors are males . It may be suggested that the male ancestor is apt to be a more heroic figure than the female ancestor . IIO THE FORMS OF THE FAMILY At any rate , when ancestor worship became fully developed it powerfully tended to reinforce the authority of the patriarch , because he was , as the eldest living ancestor , the representative of the gods upon earth , so that his power became almost divine . Religion thus finally came in to place the patriarchal family upon a very firm basis . Thus we see how each of these two great forms , the maternal family and the paternal family , arose out of cultural conditions , and therefore they may be said to represent two great stages in the social evolution of man . It is hardly necessary to point out that civilized societies are now apparently entering upon a third stage , in which there will be relative equality given to the male and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polyandry. ? We must notice now the various forms of marriage by which the family has been constituted among different peoples and in different ages . Marriage , like the family itself , is variable , and an indefinite number of forms may be found among various peoples . We shall notice , however , only the three leading forms , ? polyandry , polygyny , and monogamy , ? and attempt to show the social conditions which favor each . It is evident that if we assume that the primitive form of the family was that of a simple pairing monogamy , the burden is laid upon us to find how such different types as polyandry and polygyny arose . Polyandry , or the union of one woman with several men , is a relatively rare form of marriage and the family , found only in certain isolated regions of the world . It is particularly found in Tibet , a barren and inhospitable plateau lying north of India and adjoining China proper on the west . It is also found in certain other isolated mountainous regions in India , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of these places does it exist exclusively , but rather alongside of monogamy and perhaps other forms of the family . Thus in Tibet the upper classes practice polygyny and monogamy , while among the lower classes we find polyandry and monogamy . In all these regions where polyandry occurs , moreover , it is to be noted that the conditions of life are harsh and severe . Tibet is an exceptionPOLYANDRY I l l ally inhospitable region , with a climate of arctic rigor , the people living mainly by grazing . Under such circumstances it is conceivably difficult for one man to support and protect a family . At any rate , the form of polyandry which we find in Tibet suggests that such economic conditions may have been the main cause of its existence . Ordinarily in Tibet a polyandrous family is formed by an older brother taking a wife , and then admitting his younger brothers into partnership with him . The older brother is frequently absent from home , looking after the flocks , and in his absence one of the younger brothers assumes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how the natural human " instinct " which would oppose polyandry under ordinary circumstances , namely , the jealousy of the male , might become greatly modified , or cease to act altogether . Certain other conditions besides economic ones might also favor the existence of polyandry , such as the scarcity of women . Summing up , then , it should be noted that this rare form of the family seems to have as its causes : ( I ) In barren and inhospitable countries the labor of one man is sometimes found not sufficient to support a family . ( 2 ) Also there probably exists in such regions an excess of males . This excess might be due to one of two causes : First , the practice of exposing female infants might lead to a scarcity of women ; secondly , in such regions it is found that from causes not well understood a larger number of males are born . It may be noted as a general fact that when the conditions of life are hard in human society , owing to famine , war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of male births take place , and this would disturb the numerical proportion of the sexes in such regions . ( 3 ) A third cause may be suggested as having something to do with the matter , namely , that habits of close inbreeding , or intermarriage , might perhaps tend to overcome the natural repugnance to such a relation . Moreover , close inbreeding also , as the experiments of stockbreeders show , would tend to produce a surplus of male births , and so would act finally in the same way as the second cause . // Polygyny , l or the union of one man with several women , is a much more common form of marriage . It is , in fact , to be found sporadically among all peoples and in all ages . It has perhaps existed at least sporadically from the most primitive times , because we find that at least one of the anthropoid apes , namely , the gorilla , practices it to some extent . It is manifest , however , that it could not have existed to any extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abundant . In the main , polygyny is a later development , then , which comes in when some degree of wealth has been accumulated , that is , sufficient food supply to make it possible for one man to support several families . Polygyny came in especially after women came to be captured in war and kept as slaves or wives . The practice of wife capture , indeed , and the honor attached to the custom , had much to do in making the practice of polygyny common among certain peoples . Wherever slavery has existed , we may also note , polygyny , either in its legal form or in its illegal form of concubinage , has flourished . Polygyny , indeed , is closely related with the institution of slavery and is practically coextensive with it . In the ancient world it existed among the Hebrews and among practically all of the peoples of the Orient , and also sporadically among our own Teutonic ancestors . In modern times polygyny still exists among some Mohammedan peoples and to a greater or less degree among all semicivilized peoples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It even exists in the United States , in clandestine form . In 1852 polygamy ( meaning polygyny ) was proclaimed a doctrine of the Mormon Church and was practiced openly for many years ; but it died out when the church withdrew its sanction of plural marriages in 1890 . Two facts always need to be borne in mind regarding polygyny : First , that wherever it is practiced it is relatively confined to the upper and wealthy classes , for the reason that the support of more ' The word " polygamy " is too broad in its meaning to use as a scientific term for this form of the family ; it comes from two Greek words meaning " much married " ; hence it includes " polyandry " ( having several husbands ) and " polygyny " ( having several wives ) . // than one family is something which only the wealthy classes in a given society could assume . Secondly , it follows that under ordinary circumstances only a small minority of a given population practice polygyny , even in countries in which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egypt , for example , it is estimated that less than five per cent of the families are polygynous , while in other regions the percentage seems to be still smaller . The reason for this is not only the economic one just mentioned , but also that everywhere the sexes are relatively equal in numbers , and therefore it is impossible for polygyny to become a widespread general custom . If some men have more than one wife it is evident that other men will probably have to forego marriage entirely . This is not saying that under certain circumstances , namely , the importation of large numbers of women , a higher per cent of polygynous families may not exist . It is said that among the Negroes on the west coast of Africa the number of polygynous families reaches as high as fifty per cent , owing to the fact that female slaves are largely imported into that district , and that they serve not only as wives , but do the bulk of the agricultural labor , the male Negro preferring female slaves , who can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to male slaves . But such cases as these are altogether exceptional and manifestly could not become general . Summing up , note that the causes of polygyny are : ( I ) First of all , the brutal lust of man . No doubt man 's animal propensities have had much to do with the existence of this form of the family . Nevertheless , while male sensuality is at the basis of polygyny , it would be a mistake to think that sensuality is an adequate explanation in all cases . On the contrary , we find many other causes , chiefly , perhaps , economic , operating also to favor the development of polygyny. ( 2 ) One of these is wife capture , as we have already seen . The captured women in war were held as trophies and slaves , and later became wives or concubines . Among all peoples at a certain stage the honor of wife capture has alone been a prolific cause of polygyny. rr4 THE FORMS OF THE FAMILY ( 3 ) Another cause , after slavery became developed , was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barbarous peoples the women do the main part of the work . They are more tractable as slaves , and consequently a high value is set upon their labor . As we have already seen , these female slaves usually serve at the same time as concubines , if not legal wives of their masters . ( 4 ) Another cause which we can perhaps hardly appreciate at the present time is the high valuation set on children . We see this cause operating particularly in the case of the patriarchs of the Old Testament . Under the patriarchal family great value was set upon children as necessary to continue the family line . Where the device of adoption was not resorted to , therefore , in case of barrenness or the birth exclusively of female children , nothing was more natural than that polygyny should be resorted to in order to insure the family succession . In the patriarchal family also a high valuation was necessarily set upon children , because the larger the family grew the stronger it was . ( 5 ) Finally , religion came to sanction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked upon as one of its original causes , but when once established it reacted powerfully to reinforce and maintain the institution . How the religious sanction came about we can readily see when we remember that very commonly religions confuse the practice of the nobility with what is noble or commendable morally . The polygynous practices of the nobility , therefore , under certain conditions came to receive the sanction of religion . When this took place polygyny became firmly established as a social institution , very difficult to uproot , as all the experience of Christian missionaries among peoples practicing polygyny goes to show . Generally , also , while religion does not originate human institutions or the forms of human association , it is preeminently that which gives fixity and stability to institutions through the supernatural sanction that it accords them . Some judgment of the social value of polygyny may not be out of place in connection with this subject . Admitting , as all students of social history must , that in certain times and places the polygynous // form of family has been advantageous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilization , yet viewed from the standpoint of present society it seems that social judgment of polygyny must be wholly unfavorable . In the first place , as we have already seen , polygyny is essentially an institution of barbarism . It arose largely through the practice of wife capture and the keeping of female slaves . While often adjusted to the requirements of barbarous societies , it seems in no way adjusted to a high civilization . Polygyny , indeed , must necessarily rest upon the subjection and degradation of women . Necessarily the practice of polygyny must disregard the feelings of women , for women as well as men are jealous creatures . No high regard for the feelings of women , therefore , would be consistent with the practice of polygyny . Finally , all the evidence that we have goes to show that under polygyny children are neglected , and , at least from the standpoint of a high civilization , inadequately socialized . This must necessarily be so , because in the polygynous family the care of the children rests almost entirely with the mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries , it seems probable that infant mortality is high , and social workers in communities with polygynous families quite generally testify that many delinquent children are found in such households . Fatherhood , in the full sense of the word , can hardly be said to exist under polygyny . Those philosophers , such as Schopenhauer , who advocate the legalizing of polygyny in civilized countries , are hardly worth replying to . It is safe to say that any widespread practice of polygyny in civilized communities would lead to a reversion to the moral standards of barbarism in many if not in all matters . That polygyny is still a burning question in the United States of the twentieth century is merely good evidence that we are not yet very far removed from barbarism . Monogamy , as we have already seen , has been the prevalent form of marriage in all ages and in all countries . Wherever other forms have ( xisted monogamy has existed alongside of them as the dominant , even though perhaps not the socially honored , form . All other forms of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole // unsuited to long survival , because essentially inconsistent with the nature of human society . In civilized Europe monogamy has been the only form of the family sanctioned for ages by law , custom , and religion . The leading peoples of the world , therefore , practice monogamy , and it is safe to say that the connection between monogamy and progressive forms of civilization is not an accident . What , then , are the social advantages of monogamy which favor the development of a higher type of culture ? These advantages are numerous , but perhaps the most important of them can be grouped under six heads . ( i ) The number of men is everywhere approximately equal to the number of women . This means that monogamy is in harmony with the biological conditions that exist in the human species . The tendency to equal numbers in the two sexes has probably been established through natural selection . Why nature should favor this proportion of the sexes can perhaps be in part understood when we reflect that with such proportion there can be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible care in the rearing of offspring . ( 2 ) Monogamy secures the superior care of children in at least two respects . First , it very greatly decreases mortality in children , because under monogamy both husband and wife unite in their care . Again , monogamy secures the superior upbringing and , therefore , the superior socialization of the child . In the monogamous family much greater attention can be given to the training of children by both parents . In other forms of the family not only is the death rate higher among children , but from the point of view of modern civilization , at least , they are inferiorly socialized. ( 3 ) The monogamous family alone produces affections and emotions of the higher type . It is only in the monogamous family that the highest type of altruistic affection can be cultivated . It is difficult to understand , for example , how anything like unselfish affection between husband and wife can exist under polygyny . Under monogamy , husband and wife are called upon to sacrifice selfish desires in the mutual care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of the // Family to foster altruism in the highest degree , and , as we have seen , the higher the type of altruism produced by the family life , the higher the type of the social life generally , other things being equal . It is especially to the credit of monogamy that it has created fatherhood in the fullest sense of the term , and therefore taught the male element in human society the value of service and self-sacrifice . Under polygynous conditions the father can not devote himself to any extent to his children or to any one wife , since he is really the head of several households , and therefore , as has already been noted , fatherhood in the fullest sense scarcely exists under polygyny. ( 4 ) Under monogamy , moreover , all family relationships are more definite and strong , and thus family bonds , and ultimately social bonds , are stronger . In the polygynous household the children of the different wives are half brothers and half sisters , hence family affection has little chance to develop among them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wives there is constant pulling and hauling . Moreover , because children in a polygynous family are only half brothers and half sisters , this immensely complicates relationships , and even the line of ancestors . Legal relations and all blood relationships are , therefore , more entangled . It is no inconsiderable social merit of monogamy that it makes blood relationships simple and usually perfectly definite . All of this has an effect upon society at large , because the cohesive power of blood relationship , even in modern societies , is something still worth taking into account . But of course the main influence of all this is to be found in the family group itself , because it is only under such simple and definite relations as we find in the monogamous family that there is ample stimulus to develop the higher family affections . ( 5 ) From all this it follows that monogamy favors the development of high types of religion and morals , family affection being an indispensable root of any high type of ethical religion . That form of the family which favors the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , favor the development of the highest type of religion . We see this even more plainly , perhaps , in ancient times than // in the present time , because it was monogamy that favored the development of ancestor worship through making the line of ancestors clear and definite , and thus monogamy helped to develop this type of religion , which became the basis of still higher types . ( 6 ) Monogamy not only favors the preservation of the lives of the children , but also , when stable , favors the preservation of the lives of the parents , because it is only under monogamy that we find aged parents best cared for by their children . Under polygyny the wife who has grown old is discarded for a young wife , and usually ends her days in bitterness . The father under polygyny may be reverenced by the children , but the polygynous household rarely gives the opportunity for close affections between either parent and children . That monogamy , therefore , helps to lengthen life through favoring care of parents by children in old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adds not a little to the happiness of life , and so to the strength of social bonds , that people do not have to look forward to a cheerless and friendless old age . In brief , the monogamic family at its best presents such superior unity and harmony from every.point of view that it is much more fitted to produce a higher type of culture . From whatever point of view we may look at it , therefore , there are many reasons why civilized societies can not afford to sanction any other form of the family than that of monogamy . Conclusions as to the Causes which Determine the Form of the Family and Society. ? As we have already seen , the form of the family is undoubtedly greatly influenced by the form of industry . This is so markedly the case that some sociologists and economists have claimed that the form of the family life is but a reflection of the form of the industrial life ; that the family in its changes and variations slavishly follows the changes in economic conditions . That such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen from a brief re view of the causes which have produced certain types of family life in certain periods . Thus , the maternal type of the family can not be saiel by any means to have been determined by economic conditions . Oil I CONCLUSIONS AS TO DETERMINING CAUSES r i q the contrary , primarily the maternal family , as we have seen , was determined by certain intellectual conditions , namely , ignorance of the physiological connection between father and child , though the economic habits of primitive life tended powerfully to continue the maternal family long after intellectual conditions had changed . Again , it has been said that the patriarchal family owed its existence entirely to a form of industry , namely , pastoral industry , but , as we have seen , other factors also operated to produce the patriarchal type of the family , such as war , religion , and perhaps man 's inherent desire to dominate . Moreover , religion continued the patriarchal family in many cases long after pastoral industry had ceased to be the chief economic form . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been claimed to be due entirely to economic causes , we have seen that these so-called economic causes have only been the opportunities for the animal lust or polygynous " instinct " of man to assert itself . This polygynous tendency of man has asserted itself more or less under all conditions of society , but under certain conditions , when there was an accumulation of wealth , and especially with the institution of slavery , it had greater opportunity to assert itself than elsewhere . Thus the basic cause of polygyny is not economic , but psychological ; and given certain moral and economic conditions of society , this polygynous tendency asserts itself . Monogamy , on the other hand , is fundamentally determined by the biological fact of the numerical equality of the sexes . This is doubtless the main reason why monogamy has been the prevalent form of the family everywhere . Certain moral and psychological factors which go along with the development of higher types of culture have , however , powerfully reinforced monogamy . It is doubtful if economic conditions can to any extent be shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be , then , that the family and all other human relations are determined , not by economic forces alone , though these are influential , but by all the active factors in human association , geographic , economic , intellectual , moral , and cultural . CHAPTER VII THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE FAMILY WHILE we can not study the historical evolution of the family as an institution among the many different civilized peoples , still it will be profitable for us to consider the history of the family among some single representative people in order that we may see the forces which have made and unmade the family life , and incidentally also , to a great degree , the general social life of that people . The ancient Romans were among the earliest civilized-of the European peoples , and their institutions are , therefore , of peculiar interest to us as representing approximately the early European type . They are of especial interest also because the Romans furnished us the framework of our government and laws . What is learned concerning Roman family life , moreover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family life of other European peoples , especially the Greeks . The Greeks and the Romans , indeed , were so closely related in their early culture that for the purpose of institutional history they may be considered practically one people . The Greeks developed earlier and set the great traditions for European civilization in art and philosophy . While the family life of the ancient Hebrews is also of particular interest to us , because they gave their religion and ethics to the European world ? a religion and ethics which were essentially an expansion and idealization of the family life at its best ? yet in the family life of the ancient Romans constructive and destructive factors are more clearly marked , and it is for this reason that the study of the history of ancient Roman family life is best fitted to bring out these factors . Without any attempt then to sketch the history of the family as an institution in general , let us note for I22 // the illustration of sociological principles some of the active factors in the family life of the ancient Romans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Worship as the Basis of the Early Roman Family . What has been said thus far indicates a close connection between the family life and religion among all peoples . This was especially true of the early Romans . It may be said , indeed , that ancestor worship was the constitutive principle of their family life . Among them the family seemed to have lost in part its character as a purely social institution and to have become specialized into a religious institution . At any rate , the early Roman family existed very largely for the sake of perpetuating the worship of ancestors . Of course , ancestor worship could have had nothing to do with the origin of the family life among the Romans . The type of their family life was patriarchal , and we have already noticed the causes which brought about the existence of the patriarchal family . But while ancestor worship had nothing to do with the origin of the family , once it was thoroughly established it became the basis of the family life and transformed the family as an institution . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , if not the basis of ancestor worship , powerfully reinforced it . They believed , for example , that the soul continued in existence after death , and that persons would be unhappy unless buried in tombs with suitable offerings , and that if left unburied , or without suitable offerings , the souls of these persons would return to torment the living . Inasmuch as in the patriarchal family only sons could perform religious rites , that is , could make offerings to the departed spirits , these superstitions acted as a powerful stimulus to preserve the family in order that offerings might continue to be made at the graves of ancestors . Thus , as already said , among the early Romans the family was practically a religious institution with ancestor worship as its constitutive principle . It is supposed by de Coulanges that in the earliest times the dead ancestors were buried beneath the hearth . At any rate , the hearth was the place where offerings were made to the de124 HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE FAMILY parted ancestors , and the flame on the hearth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The house under such circumstances became a temple and the whole atmosphere of the family life was necessarily a religious one . ( 2 ) The Authority in the Early Roman Family was vested , as in all patriarchal families , in the father or eldest living male of the family group . Under ancestor worship he became the living representative of the departed ancestors , the link between the living and the dead . Here we may note that the family was not considered as constituted simply of its living members , but that it included also all of its dead members . Inasmuch as the dead were more numerous and were thought to be more powerful than the living , they were by far the more important element in the life of the family . The position of the house father , as representative of the departed ancestors , and as the link between the living and the dead , naturally made his authority almost divine . Hence , the house father was himself , then , almost a deity , having absolute power over all persons within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This absolute power , which was known in the early Roman family as the " patria potestas , " could not , however , be exercised arbitrarily . The house father , as representative of the departed ancestors , was necessarily controlled by religious scruples and traditions . It was impossible for him to act other than for what he believed to be the will of the ancestors . Disobedience to him was , therefore , disobedience to the divine ancestors , and hence was sacrilegious. ( 3 ) Relationship in the Early Roman Family was determined by community of worship , inasmuch as only descendants upon the male side could perform religious rites , and inasmuch as married women worshiped the household gods of their husbands ' ancestors ; therefore , only descendants on the male side could worship the same ancestors and were relatives in the full religious and legal sense . These were known as " agnates . " Later , some relationship on the mother 's side came to be recognized , but relatives on the mother 's side were known as " cognates , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . // Indeed , in the earliest times the property of the family , as has already been implied , was kept as a unit , held in trust by the eldest living member of the family group for the good of all the family . In other words , the house father in earliest times did not possess the right to make a will , but the property of the family passed intact from him to his eldest male heir . The Marriage Ceremony among the Early Romans was necessarily of a religious charcter . It was constituted essentially of the induction of the bride into the worship of her husband 's ancestors . But before this could be done the bride 's father had first to free her from the worship of her household gods , in later times a certificate of manumis- sion being given not unlike the manumission of a slave . After the bride had been released from the worship of her father 's ancestors , the bridegroom and his friends brought her to his father 's house , where a ceremony of adoption was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family of her husband . The essence of this ceremony , as already said , was the induction of the bride into the wor-ship of her husband 's ancestors , and this was done through their both making an offering on the family hearth and eating a sacrificial meal together . After that the wife worshiped at her husband 's altar and had no claim upon the household gods of her father . Divorce . Under such circumstances it is not surprising that marriage was practically indissoluble . A wife who was driven out of her husband 's household , or who deserted , was without family gods of any sort , having no claim upon those of her husband , and became , therefore , a social outcast . Under such circumstances it is not surpris-ing that divorce was practically unknown . It is said , indeed , that for five hundred and twenty years after Rome was founded there was not a single divorce in Rome . While this may be an exaggeration , it is historically certain that divorce was so rare in early Rome as to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sons to be born there was no taking of a second wife , as among the Hebrews . Polygyny was un-known in early Rome . The Roman device to prevent the failure of // the family succession was adoption . Younger sons of other families were adopted if no sons were born , and these adopted sons , taking the family name , became the same legally as sons by birth . Inasmuch as the position of younger sons in the patriarchal household was not an enviable one there was never lack of candidates for the position of eldest son in some family group in which no sons had been born . Not only was the early Roman family life the most stable that the world has ever known , but it was also of a relatively pure type . Chastity was rigidly enforced among the women , but of course , as in all primitive peoples , was not enforced among the men . Still it was expected that the married men at least should remain relatively faithful to their wives . On the whole , therefore , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a singularly high and stable type . While the position of women and children in the early Roman family was one of subjection , the family itself was nevertheless of a high type . ( 7 ) The Decadence . But it was inevitable that this type of family should decay , and this decay began comparatively early . Inasmuch as the early Roman family was based upon ancestor worship , a religion which was fitted for relatively small isolated groups , it was inevitable that the family life should decay with this ancestor worship . How early the decay of ancestor worship began it is impossible to say . Perhaps the nature gods , Jupiter , Venus , and the rest , existed alongside of ancestor worship from the earliest times . At any rate , we find their worship growing rapidly within the period of authentic history and undermining the domestic worship , while at a still later period skeptical philosophy undermined both religions . Along with the decay of ancestor worship went many economic and political changes which marked the dissolution of the patriarchal family . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decadence were . ( 8 ) Steps in the Decadence . ( a ) One of the earliest steps toward the breaking down of the patriarchal family was the limiting of the power of the house father . This took place very early ? as soon as the Council of Elders , or Senate , was formed to look after matters of collective // interest . Gradually the paternal power diminished , until it was confined to matters concerning the family group proper . ( b ) A second step was when the right to make a will was conceded . This right , as we have seen , did not exist in the earliest Roman times , but with the development of property and of a more complex economic life the house father was given the right to divide his property among his children , at first only on the male side , but later among any of his children , and still later to bequeath it to whom he pleased . ( c ) Thus women came to be given the right to hold property , a thing which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holders , their other rights in many respects began to increase . Originally the wife had no right to divorce her husband , but in the second century B.C. women also gained the right of divorcing their husbands . ( d ) The rights of children were increased along with the rights of women , particularly of younger children . ( e ) The right of plebeians to intermarry with the noble families became recognized . All of these changes we should perhaps regard as good in themselves , but they nevertheless marked the disintegration of the patriarchal family . The decay of the family life did not stop with these changes , however , but went on to the decay of the family bonds themselves . Later Roman Family Life. ? By the beginning of the Christian era the relations between the sexes had become very loose . Men not only frequently divorced their wives , but women frequently divorced their husbands . Indeed , a complete revolution passed over the Roman family . Marriage became a private contract , whereas , as we have seen , in the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage were developed , which amounted practically to temporary marriages . In all cases it was easy for a husband or wife to divorce the other for very trivial causes . Among certain classes of Roman society the instability of the family became so great that we find Seneca saying that there were women who reckoned their years by // their husbands , and Juvenal recording one woman as having eight husbands in five years . Women and children achieved their practical emancipation , as we would say . Women , especially , were free to do as they saw fit . Marriages were formed and dissolved at pleasure among certain classes , and among all classes the instability of the family life had become very great . Along with all this , of course , went a growth of vice . It is not too much to say that the Romans of the first and second centuries A.D. approached as closely to a condition of promiscuity as any civilized people of which we have knowledge . Causes of the Decadence . When we examine the causes of this great revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family of the early Romans to the laxity and promiscuity of the later Romans , we find that these causes can perhaps be grouped under four principal heads : ( I ) First among all the causes was the destruction of the domestic religion , namely , ancestor worship , largely through the growth of nature worship and skeptical philosophy . The destruction of the domestic religion necessarily shattered the foundations of the Roman family , since , as we have already seen , there was the closest connection between the family life of the early Romans and ancestor worship . But it is not probable that ancestor worship was destroyed merely through the growth of nature worship and skeptical philosophy . As we have already seen , it was a religion which was mainly adapted to isolated groups . Changes in economic and political conditions , therefore , were to some extent prior to the decay of the domestic religion . ( 2 ) Changes in economic conditions , that is , in the form of industry , were , then , among the more important causes of the decay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essentially to the pastoral stage of industry , and as soon as settled agricultural life , commerce , and manufacturing industry developed , this destroyed the isolated patriarchal groups , and so also in time affected even the religion which was their basis . Again , the growth of cities going along with // these changes in the methods of obtaining a living destroyed the old conditions under which the family had been the social and political unit . ( 3 ) We have therefore as a third cause the breaking up of old political conditions . Family groups were welded into small cities and the authority of the patriarch was destroyed . Legislation designed to meet the new social conditions , especially such as we have already noted in the steps of the decadence , profoundly affected the whole family group and weakened family bonds . ( 4 ) The growth of divorce and of vice may be put down as a fourth cause of the decay of the Roman family . Some may say that this was an effect of the decay of the Roman family rather than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an effect , for it is a peculiarity of social life that what is at one stage an effect reacts to become a cause at a later stage ; and this was certainly the case with the growth of divorce and vice in Rome , in its effect upon the Roman family . Moreover , much of this came from Greece through imitation . The family life had decayed in Greece much earlier than it had in Rome , and when Rome conquered Greece it annexed its vices also . While the most radical social changes do not usually come about merely through imitation , yet the imitation of a foreign people is frequently , in the history of a particular nation , one of the most potent causes in bringing about social changes . It was certainly so in the case of the growth of divorce and vice in Rome . Conclusions as to the Causes of Social Change. ? We see that t he causes of the decay of the Roman family life were very complex . This is true of all important social changes . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single principle or set of causes . While changes in economic conditions were undoubtedly very influential in bringing about the profound changes in the Roman family , still we have no ground for regarding the economic changes as determinative of all the rest . We know as yet little of the development of industry in antiquity . What little we do know , however , furnishes good ground for claiming that changes in the methods of getting a living are among the most influential causes of social change in general ; // but there is nothing which warrants the sweeping generalization of Karl Marx and his followers , " that the method of the production of the material life determines the social , political , and spiritual life process in general . " On the contrary , the evolution of the Roman family clearly shows moral and psychological factors at work quite independent of economic causes . The decay of ancestor worship , for example , can not be wholly attributed to the change in the method of getting a living . The very growth of population and accompanying changes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the undermining of ancestor worship . Moreover , while religion may not be an original determining cause of social forms , it is , nevertheless , as we have already seen , an influence that gives them stability and permanency , so much so that the life history of a culture is frequently the life history of a religion . The decay of religious ideas and beliefs , therefore , from any cause , frequently proves the important element working for social change in all societies . So , too , changes in political conditions , especially changes in law through new legislation , frequently prove a profound modifying influence in societies . Lastly , there are certain moral causes inherent in the individual oftentimes involving perverted expressions of " instinct , " which lead to profound social changes . Such was the vice which Rome copied very largely from Greece , but which proved the final solvent in its family life . In general it is evident , then , that there is no single principle which will explain the evolution of the family from the earliest times down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family to a single principle , or to show that it has been controlled by a single set of causes , must inevitably end in failure . The economic determinism of Marx and his followers , the ideological conceptions of Hegel , the geographical influences of Buckle and his school , and like explanations , are all found wanting when they are applied to the actual history of the family . It is not different with the theories of recent sociologists , who would strive to explain all social changes through a single principle . Unilateral sociological principles , such as " Habit , " " Environment , " " Imitation , " and " Consciousness of Kind " will not go further // in explaining the changes in the family life than some of the older principles that have just been mentioned . Human life is , indeed , too complex to be explained in terms of any single principle or any single set ( f causes . The family in particular is an organic structure which responds first to one set of stimuli and then to another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious ideas , now by legislation , now by imitation , and so on through the whole set of possible stimuli which may impinge upon and modify the activity of a living organism . So it is with all institutions . The Influence of Christianity upon the Family. ? While we need not study further the historical evolution of the family in any detail , still it is necessary , in order to avoid too great discontinuity , to notice in a few sentences the influence of Christianity upon the family in Western civilization . Early Christianity , as we have already seen , found the family life of the Greco-Roman world demoralized . The reconstruction of the family became , therefore , one of the first tasks of the new religion , and while other circumstances may have aided the church in this work , still on the whole it was mainly the influence of the early church that reconstituted the family life . At least four effects of early Christianity upon the family should be noted : ( i ) From the first the church worked to abolish divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prostitution , that came to flourish to such an extent in the Pagan world . Only very slowly did the early leaders of the church win the mass of the people to accepting their views as to the permanency of the marriage bond . In order to aid in making this bond more stable the early church recognized marriage as one of the sacraments , and , as implied , steadily opposed the idea of the later Roman law that marriage was simply a private contract . The result was , eventually , that marriage came to be regarded again as a religious bond , and the family life took on once more the aspect of great stability . After the church had come fully into power in the Western world , legal divorce ceased to be recognized and legal separation was substituted in its stead . // Thus the church succeeded in reconstituting the family life upon a stable basis , but the family , after being reconstituted , was of a semipatriarchal type . The husband was the head of the family , with much more authority than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church had no model to go by except the paternal family of the Hebrew and Greek and Roman civilization . Nevertheless , the place of women and children in this semi-patriarchal religious family established by the church was higher on the whole than in the ancient patriarchal family . The church put an end to the exposure of children , which had been common in Rome , and protected childhood in many ways . The church elevated the place of woman in the family , though leaving her subject to her husband . The veneration of the Virgin tended particularly to give women an honored place socially and religiously , but by the advocacy and practice of ascetic doctrines the early church may be said to have detracted from the social valuation of the family . On the whole , the reconstituting of the family by the early church must be regarded as its most striking social work . But the thing for us to note particularly is that the type of the family life created by the church was a semipatriarchal type , in which the importance of husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the members of the family group . It was this semipatriarchal family which persisted down to the nineteenth century . CHAPTER VIII THE PROBLEM OF THE MODERN FAMILY PASSING over the changes which affected the family during the Middle Ages , and the still more striking changes which came through the Reformation , let us now turn to the study of the problem of the family in the modern world . Peculiarities of Modern Civilization. ? We must note some of the great movements which have made modern civilization what it is in its moral aspects.The first of these is the rise of individualism and the decline of authority . This movement began , or rather had its first manifestation , in the Protestant Reformation . In the latter years of the eighteenth century it culminated in the French Revolution , and in the subsequent rise of political democracy among all European peoples . This growth of individualism and decline of authority has continued down to the present , until both religious and political authority are perhaps less in the civilized world of to-day than ever before in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the family has been that the authoritarian type of the family has tended to disappear . The religious theory of the family which prevailed during the Middle Ages , but which was more or less undermined by the Reformation , has given place among large classes of the population to the view that marriage is a private contract . This view of the family has even been embodied to a large extent in our laws . The second great influence which has affected modern civilization is the revolution in industry , owing to the invention of machinery and the rise of the factory system . This has tended , as we have al ready seen , to destroy the economic functions of the family and to individualize its members in their economic activities . The indivn x34 // izsil , in other words , has become the unit in production as well as the political unit . This has tended to destroy the social cohesion between t he members of the family group and has even to some extent placed the sexes in competition with each other . A third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wealth which has resulted from the introduction of machine industry . While this wealth has not extended to all classes of society , it has emancipated certain classes from the fear of want , a factor which in the past put an effective restraint upon conduct . The growth of wealth , in other words , has favored , in certain classes at least , lower moral standards , and increasing laxity in family relations . A fourth movement which has been supremely important in modern civilization has been the development of physical science . Both the machine age and the growth of wealth have been largely the result of the mastery of the forces of nature which physical science has made possible . Thus the physical sciences have made the comforts and conveniences of life not only accessible to greater numbers of men than ever before , but they have also made these the chief rewards of effort . Moreover , the physical sciences , through their very methods of interrogating nature and through their insistence that the only evidence which can be accepted is the evidence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions . It is not too much to say that this critical attitude has resulted in the undermining of many cherished beliefs upon which these institutions were based in the past . Owing to these and many minor causes the nineteenth century was a period of great social change and unrest . It was a period of social disintegration and of social reconstruction , as yet far from complete . Now , in such periods of social disinteglzation , confusion and instability ht institutions are apt to manifest themselves , until some new basis for a stable social order can be found . While the forces making for social dissolution manifested themselves comparatively late in the family , the modern family has suddenly found itself confronted with // the need of social readjustment and in the midst of change and confusion . The Problem of the Family. ? Thus it happens that we find the family life of the twentieth century in many countries in a more unstable condition than it has been at any other time since the beginning of the Christian Era . Now , any great instability of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monogamy . Hence the problem of the modern family is whether permanent monogamy shall continue to exist or to be the standard in Western civilization . There are many who do not hesitate to say that the family , in its present form of permanent monogamy , will soon pass away . While such a statement is wholly unwarranted from a scientific standpoint , the student of the family can not fail to see that the crux of the problem of the modern family lies in its instability . The legal expression of the instability of the family is to be seen in divorce . If the whole problem of the modern family centers in the matter of its instability , then the study of the divorce movement should throw more light upon the condition of the modern family than the study of anything else . Just how far we have gone already toward getting rid of permanent monogamy as the standard in mod ern society will be more or less evident from the divorce statistics . However , the student must bear in mind that divorce statistics never adequately measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the legal expression of such instability . In every community a certain number of marriages are dissolved without the formality of legal divorce . Among the very poorest class in American cities , it is found that illegal desertion is about four times as common as legal divorce . Hence it has been reliably estimated that the total desertions in the United States are in excess of 50,000 annually . This number must be added to the number of divorces granted to get an approx imate measure of the real instability of the family in American society . As implied by the above , the instability of the modern family is especially evident in the United States . This is due in part to the // freedom with which legal divorce has been granted in the United States ; but it is also due in part to the fact that American society has exaggerated the individualism and industrialism which are characteristic of Western civilization in general . Hence , although the disintegration of the family characterizes more or less all modern civilization , it is particularly American conditions that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern society in respect to the family . Without devoting too much time to the consideration of divorce statistics in their technical aspects , let us note , then , some of the main outlines of the modern divorce movement in this and other civilized countries . Statistics of Divorce in the United States and Other Civilized Countries. ? For many years the United States has led the world in the number of its divorces . Already in 1885 this country had more divorces than all the rest of the Christian civilized world put together . These statistics of the number of divorces granted in different civilized countries in 1885 ( taken from Professor W. F. Willcox 's monograph on The Divorce Problem ) are of sufficient interest to cite at length : // // // // // Switzerland 920 Australia 1 oo // // It will be noted that in this particular year ( 1885 ) when the United States had 23,472 divorces , all the other countries mentioned together had only 20,131 . In 1927 the United States had 192,037 divorces , which was exceeded only by Soviet Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorces , or one divorce to every 3.8 marriages . All the rest of the Christian civilized world in 1927 had less than 90,000. // The following statistics are available for the years indicated : United States ( 1937 ) ? 249,000 Czechoslovakia ( 1937 ) ? ? ? ? ? 5,373 Germany ( 1937 ) 46,786 Sweden ( 1937 ) 3,636 Japan ( 1937 ) ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 46,500 Switzerland ( 1937 ) ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 3,379 France ( 1937 ) 23,614 Denmark ( 1937 ) 3,344 Rumania ( 1937 ) 12,380 Belgium ( 1937 ) ? 3,208 Austria ( 1936 ) 6,28o Canada ( 1937 ) ? ? ? ? ? ? 1,842 Great Britain ( 1937 ) ? ? ? ? ? 5,535 Norway ( 1937 ) 1,046 Recent statistics for Russia are not available , but it is known that the large number reported for 1927 was very unusual , and no doubt the usual number there is smaller than that for the United States . It is evident that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilized nations . The above statistics show that in Austria there was one divorce to seven marriages , in Switzerland one to nine , in Denmark one to ten , in France and in Japan one to twelve , in Germany one to fourteen , in Sweden and in Rumania one to fifteen , in Belgium one to twenty-one , in Norway one to twenty-three , in Czechoslovakia one to twenty-four , in Canada one to forty-two , in Great Britain one to seventy-two ; but in the United States the rate in 1937 was one divorce to 5.8 marriages . In Wyoming in 1937 there was one divorce to every 2.3 marriages , in California one to 2.7 , in Oregon one to 2.8 , in Texas one to 3.1 , in Florida one to 3.2 , in Ohio one to 3.5 , in Oklahoma one to 3.6 , in Missouri one to 4.4 , in Montana one to 4.5 , in Colorado one to 4.7 , in Maine one to 4.9 , in Kansas one to 5.2 . While these rates are those of some of the states in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states in which the divorce rate ranges from one to every 4 marriages to one to 7 marriages are so numerous that they may be said to be fairly representative of American conditions . The divorce census for 1940 gave returns very similar to those of 1937 , except that in the intervening period the number of divorces increased to 264,000 . In 1932 the number of divorces granted was only 160,338 , as divorces decrease in depressions . Some states in 1916 , however , already had as high divorce rates as in 1937 . Thus in Oregon in 1916 there was already one divorce to every 2.5 marriages , and in Washington one to every 4 marriages . // Increase of Divorces in the United States . Not only does the United States lead the world in the number of its divorces , but divorces are increasing in this country much more rapidly than the population . In 867 , the first year for which statistics for the country as a whole were gathered , there were 9937 divorces in the United States , but by 1940 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of divorces granted in this country , yearly , had reached 264,000 . Again , from 1867 to 1886 there were 328,716 divorces granted in the United States , but during the next twenty years , from 1887 to 1906 , the number reached 945,625 . Again , from 1906 to 1940 the number of divorces increased 266 per cent , while the population increased only about 55 per cent ; and from 1930 to 1940 the number of divorces increased 37 per cent , while the population increased only 7.2 per cent . Thus it appears that divorces are probably now increasing in the United States about five times as fast as the increase of population . It becomes , therefore , a matter of some curious interest to speculate upon what will be the end of this movement . If divorces should continue to increase as they have increased during the past fifty years , it is evident that it would not be long before more marriages would be terminated by divorce than by death . In 1870 , 3.5 per cent of all marriages were terminated by divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorce ; and in 1940 , 16.9 per cent . Before the beginning of the twentieth century Professor Willcox estimated that if the divorce rate continued to increase , by 1990 one half of all the marriages in the United States will be terminated by divorce . Thus we are apparently within measurable distance of a time when , if present tendencies continue , the family will not be considered as a probably permanent union between husband and wife , lasting until death . And if primary groups are as important as alleged in Chapter IV for the socialization of the individual and the preservation of the higher values of civilization , the increasing instability of the family will threaten us with general social demoralization . Without , however , stopping at this point to discuss the results or the effects of the divorce movement upon society , let us now consider for a moment I40 THE PROBLEM OF THE MODERN FAMILY how these divorces are distributed among the various elements and classes of our population . Distribution of Divorces . It is usually thought by those who have observed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the laboring classes , but is least common among the middle classes . We have no statistics to bear out this belief , but it seems probable that it is substantially correct . The divorce statistics which we have , however , indicate certain striking differences in the distribution of divorces by classes and communities . ( I ) The divorce rate is higher in the cities than in their surrounding country districts . The statistics show , for example , that in many cities in the Central West the divorce rates are much higher than in the states in which they are situated . Exceptions to this generalization are cities in which a large proportion of the population are Roman Catholic or of foreign birth . ( 2 ) The census statistics show that apparently the divorce rate is about eight times as high for childless couples as for couples that have children . This doubtless does not mean that domestic unhappiness is eight times more common in families where there are no children than in families that have children , but it does show , nevertheless , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a powerful force to bind husband and wife together . ( 3 ) While we have no statistics from this country telling us exactly what the distribution of divorces is among the various religious denominations , still we know that because the Roman Catholic Church is strongly against divorce , divorces are very rare in that denomination . In Switzerland , where the number of divorces among Protestants and Catholics has been noted , it is found that divorces are four times as common among Protestants as among Catholics . Some observers in this country have claimed that divorces are most common among those of no religious profession , next most common among Protestants , next among Jews , and least common among Roman Catholics . ( q ) From this we might expect , as our statistics indicate , that the divorce rate is much higher among the native whites in this country // than it is among the foreign-born , for many of the foreign-born are Roman Catholics , and , in any case , they come from countries where divorce is less common than in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirds of all divorces have been granted on demand of the wife . This may indicate , on the one hand , that the increase of divorces is a movement connected with the emancipation of woman , and on the other hand it may indicate that it is the husband who most often gives the ground for divorce . ( 6 ) The census statistics show three great centers of divorce in the United States . One is the New England states , one the states of the Central West , and one the Rocky Mountain and Pacific Coast states . These three regions are also typical centers of American institutions and ideas . The individualism of the New England , the Central West , and the Rocky Mountain and Pacific Coast regions has always been marked in comparison with some other sections of the country . But since about 1900 divorce has also been increasing rapidly in the Southern states , and we now find such states as Texas , Arkansas , and Oklahoma well up toward the front among the states with a high divorce rate . This distribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country suggests something as to the causes of divorce , and this will come out fully later in a discussion of the causes of the increase of divorce . The Grounds for Granting Divorce. ? There are no less than thirty-six distinct grounds for absolute divorce recognized by the laws of the several states , ranging from only one ground recognized in New York to fourteen grounds recognized in New Hampshire . For this reason some have supposed that many of the divorces in this country are granted on comparatively trivial grounds . Several states have , for example , what is known as an " Omnibus Clause , " granting divorce for mere incompatibility and the like . But the examination of divorce statistics shows that very few divorces are granted on trivial grounds . On the contrary , most divorces seem to be granted for grave reasons , such as adultery , desertion , cruelty , imprisonment for crime , // habitual drunkenness , and neglect on the part of the husband to provide for his family . These are usually recognized as grave reasons for the dissolution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be said to be trivial . Professor Willcox showed that for the twenty-year period 1867 to 1886 , over ninety-seven per cent of all divorces were granted for these six principal causes . Moreover , he also showed that over sixty per cent were granted for the two most serious causes of all , ? adultery and desertion . Again , of the one million divorces granted from 1887 to 1906 over ninety-four per cent were granted for the six principal causes , with over fifty-five per cent for adultery and desertion , while in still other cases adultery and desertion figured in combination with other causes ( a total of over sixty-two per cent in all ) . Therefore , it seems probable that in nearly two thirds of the cases the marriage bond had already practically been dissolved before the courts stepped in to make the dissolution formal . We must conclude , therefore , that divorce is prevalent not because of the laxity of our laws , but rather because of the decay of our family life ; that divorce is but a symptom of the disintegration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instability of the Family. ? In other words , divorce is but a symptom of more serious evils , and these evils have in certain classes of American society apparently undermined the very virtues upon which the family life subsists . This is not saying that sex immorality is more prevalent to-day than it was fifty years ago . We have some statistics which seem to indicate this , but there may well be a difference of opinion upon such a subject . It is the opinion of some authorities that there has been no growth of immorality in the United States along with the growth of divorce , but this would seem to be doubtful . The very causes for which divorce is granted suggest a demoralization of certain social classes . While there may not have been , therefore , any general growth of sex immorality in the United States along with the growth of divorce , it is conceivable that it may have increased greatly in certain classes of American society . Be this as it may , it is not necessary to assume that there has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for if actual moral practices are no higher than they were fifty years ago that alone would be a sufficient reason to explain considerable disintegration of our family life . It is an important truth in sociology that the morality which suffices for a relatively simple social life , largely rural , such as existed in this country seventy years ago , is not sufficient for a more complex society which is largely urban , such as exists at the present time . Moreover , recognized moral standards within the past seventy years have largely been raised through the growth of general intelligence . It follows that immoral acts which were condoned seventy years ago and which produced but slight social effect , to-day meet with great reprobation and have far greater social consequences than a generation ago . This is particularly true of the standards which the wife imposes upon the husband . For centuries , as we have already seen , the husband has secured divorce for adultery of the wife , but for centuries no divorce was given to the wife for the adultery of the husband ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless the adultery of the husband is accompanied by other flagrant violations of morality . Conduct on the part of the husband , which the wife overlooked , therefore , two generations ago , is to-day sufficient to disrupt the family bonds and become a ground for the granting of a divorce . Even if sexual immorality , then , has not increased in our population , if moral practices are no higher to-day than fifty years ago , we should expect that this alone would have far different consequences now than then . The growth of intelligence and of higher and more complex forms of social organization necessitates realization of higher standards of conduct if the institutions of society are to retain their stability . But there are grave reasons for believing that there has been in certain classes of society a decay of the very virtues upon which the family rests ; for family life requires not only chastity , but even more the virtues of self-sacrifice , loyalty , obedience , and self-subordination . Now there is abundant evidence to show that these particular virtues which belong to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the changes and new adjustments of modern society . We have // replaced these virtues largely by those of self-interest , self-direction , and self-assertiveness . Causes of the Increasing Instability of the Family in the United States. ? Let us note somewhat more in detail the causes of the increased instability of the American family during the past six or eight decades . We have already in a rough way indicated some of these causes in studying the distribution of divorce and the grounds upon which it is granted . But the causes of the instability of the family so affect our whole social life and all of our institutions that they are well worth somewhat more detailed study . ( 1 ) As the first of these causes of the increase of divorce in the United States we should put the decay of religion , particularly of the religious theory of marriage and the family . As we have already seen , no stable family life has existed anywhere in history without a religious basis , but within the last few decades religious sentiments , beliefs , and ideals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the result is that many people regard the institutions of marriage and the family as a matter of personal convenience . This decay of the religious view of the marriage bond has , however , had other antecedent causes , partly in the moral and intellectual spirit of our civilization , partly in our industrial conditions . ( 2 ) We should put , therefore , as a second cause of the increase of divorces in this country the growing spirit of individualism . By individualism is meant here the spirit of self-assertion and self-interest , the spirit which leads a man to find his law in his own wishes , or even in his whims and caprices . Now , this growing spirit of individualism is undoubtedly more destructive of the social life than anything else . It makes unstable all institutions , and especially the family , because the family must rest upon very opposite characteristics . Our laissezfaire democracy , our industrial organization , and our unsocialized education have all been responsible to some extent for making the individual take his own interests and wishes as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread within the last seventy years especially among the women of the population , and has proCAUSES // doted a great movement , known in its moderate phases as the " Woman 's Movement " and in its more radical phases as " Feminism . " The woman 's movement has accompanied and in part effected the emancipation of women legally , mentally , and economically . The result is that women , as a class , have become as much individualized as the men , and oftentimes are as great practical individualists . No one would claim that the emancipation of woman , in the sense of freeing her from those things which have prevented the highest and best development of her personality , is not desirable . But this emancipation of woman has brought with it certain opportunities for going down as well as for going up . Woman 's emancipation has not , in other words , meant to all classes of women , woman 's elevation . On the contrary , it has been to some , if not an opportunity for license , at least an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of society and particularly with the stability of the family . We may remind ourselves once more that the Roman women achieved complete emancipation , but they did not thereby better their social position . On the contrary , the emancipation of woman in Rome meant woman 's degradation , and ultimately the demoralization of Roman family life . While this is not necessarily an accompaniment of woman 's emancipation , still it is a real danger which threatens , and of which we can already see many evidences in modern society . As in all other emancipatory movements , the dangers of freedom are found for some individuals at least to be quite as great as the dangers of subjection . That the woman 's movement has had much to do with the growth of divorce in this country gains substantiation from the fact that many leaders of that movement , especially the more radical such as Mrs. Gilman and Miss Ellen Key , have advocated free divorce , and their inculcation of this doctrine certainly could not have been without some effect . But the woman 's movement would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of widespread support , if it had not been for the economic emancipation of woman through the opening to her of // many new industrial callings and the securing for her a certain measure of economic independence . This , again , while perhaps a good thing in itself , has nevertheless facilitated the growing tendency to form unstable family relations . But obviously this economic independence of woman is the necessary and , indeed , inevitable outcome of modern industrial development . ( 4 ) The growth of modern industrialism ? that is , manufacturing industry ? must , then , be regarded as one of the fundamental factors which has brought about the increase of divorce in the United States . As we have already noticed , the growth of manufacturing industry has opened a large number of new economic callings to woman and has rendered her largely economically independent of family relations . Moreover , the labor of women in factories has tended to disrupt the home , particularly in the case of married women , as we have already seen . For the laboring classes it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with little or no development of a true family life . Again , such labor has set the sexes in competition with each other , has tended to reduce their sexual differences and to stimulate immensely their individualism . Finally , inasmuch as modern industrialism has tended to destroy the home , the result has been the production of unsocialized children , and especially of those whohad no tradition of a family life . Girls , for example , through industrialism , have failed to learn the domestic arts , failed to have any training in homemaking , and therefore when they came to the position of wife and mother , they were frequently not fitted for such a life , and through their lack of adjustment rendered the homes which they formed unstable . ( 5 ) Closely connected with the growth of modern industrialists is the growth of modern cities , and , as we have already seen , divorce is usually much more common in the cities than in the rural districts . The growth of the cities , in other words , has been a cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the economic conditions under which they live , are peculiarly homeless . A normal home can scarcely exist in the slums and in some of the tenement // districts of our cities . Again , in the city there is perhaps more vice and other immorality , less control of the individual by public opinion , and more opportunity , on account of close living together and high standards of living , for friction , both within and without the domestic circle . ( 6 ) The higher standards of living and comfort which have come with the growth of our industrial civilization , especially of our cities , must also be set down as a cause of increasing instability of the family . I Iigh standards of living are , of course , desirable if they can be realized , that is , if they are reasonable . But many elements of our population have standards of living and comfort which they find are practically impossible to realize with the income which they have . Many classes , in other words , are unable to meet the social demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a home . To found and maintain a home , therefore , with these rising standards of living , and also frequently with rising costs of living , requires such a large income that a constantly decreasing proportion of the population are able to do this satisfactorily . From this cause , undoubtedly , a great deal of domestic misery and unhappiness results , which finally shows itself in desertion or in the divorce court . It is evident that higher standards of taste and higher standards of morality may also operate under certain circumstances to render the family life unstable in a similar way . ( 7 ) Another cause of the increase of divorce in the United States is the popularization of law which has accompanied the growth of democratic institutions . Law was once the prerogative of special classes , and courts were rarely appealed to except by the noble or wealthy classes ; but with the growth of democratic institutions there has been a great spread of legal education , especially through the modern newspaper , and consequently a greater participation in the . remedies offered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagined . Many people , for example , who would not have thought of divorce two generations ago , now know how divorce may be secured and are ready to secure it . However , it would seem as if this cause of the inI48 THE PROBLEM OF THE MODERN FAMILY crease of divorce might have operated to a greater extent forty-five or fifty years ago than it has during the last four decades , for it can not be said that recently there has been much increase of legal education among the masses , or much greater popularization of the law . ( 8 ) Increasing laxity of the laws regarding divorce and increasing laxity in the administration of the laws has certainly been a cause of increasing divorce in the United States , though back of these causes doubtless lie all the other causes just mentioned , and also increasing laxity in public opinion regarding marriage and divorce . To assume that laxity of the laws and of legal administration has no influence upon the increase of divorce in a population is to go contrary to all human experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , are not very different from ourselves in culture and in institutions , yet there is little divorce in England and in Canada as compared with the United States . Unquestionably the main cause of this great difference is to be found in the difference of their laws . This is not saying , however , that instability of the family does not characterize Canada and England as well as the United States , even though such instability does not express itself in the divorce courts . Interesting statistics have been collected in numerous places in our country to show the laxity of the administration of the divorce laws . In many of the divorce courts of our large cities , for example , it has repeatedly been shown that the average time occupied by the court in granting a divorce is not more than fifteen minutes . In other words , divorce cases are frequently rushed through our divorce courts without solemnity , without adequate investigation , with every opportunity for collusion between the parties , so as to favor a very free granting of divorces . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for divorce which come to trial are refused by the courts , showing that the courts are not so lax in all cases as they are sometimes pictured to be . Moreover , the divorce courts have two excuses for their laxity . First , the divorce courts are always greatly overburdened with the number of cases before them ; and , secondly , public opinion , which the // courts as well as other phases of our government largely reflect , favors this laxity . This is shown by the fact that public opinion stands back of the lax divorce statutes of many states , all efforts to make radical changes in these statutes having failed in recent years . ( 9 ) The disintegration of the family in Western civilization is due to causes deeper than any which have thus far been discussed . So far as they can be summed up in a single sentence , it is due to the increasingly sensate character of our civilization ; that is , increasing tendency to find the values of life in sense satisfactions . In other words , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have become more and more materialistic . This leads to increasing instability in family relations ; because when the values of life are chiefly in sense satisfactions , there is apt to be more conflict between individuals . Careful study has shown that if the whole of civilization takes on a sensate character , more and more conflicts between individuals and groups are the result . If that is so regarding civilization as a whole , it must be so regarding the relations between individuals in the family . Such materialistic standards cause conflicts not only between husband and wife but also between parents and children . A family life on a more idealistic basis , exalting such intangibles as good will , love , justice , and mutual sacrifice , is much more apt to remain stable . However , the trend in our civilization for nearly a century has been away from idealism and toward a crude realism which recognizes but little place for faith , hope , and love in human relations . ( to ) Our study of the family has accustomed us to the thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human institutions , undergoes constant changes . Now at periods of change in any institution , periods of transition from one type to another , there is apt to be a period of confusion . The old type of institution is never replaced at once by a new type of institution ready-made and adjusted to the social life , but only gradually does the new institution emerge from the elements of the old . In the meantime , however , there may be a considerable period of confusion and anarchy . This social princi150 THE PROBLEM OF THE MODERN FAMILY pie , it should be noted , rests upon the deeper psychological principle that old habits are usually not replaced by new habits without an intervening period of confusion and uncertainty . In other words , in the transition from the old habit to the new habit there is much opportunity for disorganization and disintegration . It is exactly so in human society , because social institutions are but expressions of habit . Now , the old semipatriarchal type of the family , which prevailed down to the beginning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps properly be called the monarchical type , has been disappearing for the past one hundred years , ? is in fact already practically extinct , at least in America , but we have not yet built up a new type of the family to take its place . The old semipatriarchal family of our forefathers has gone , but no new type of the family has yet become general . A democratic type of the family in harmony with our democratic civilization must be evolved . But such a democratic type of the family can be stable only upon the condition that its stability is within itself and not without . Authority in various coercive forms made the old type of the family stable , but a stable basis for a new type of the family has not yet been found , or rather it has not been found by large elements of our population . Unquestionably a democratic ethical type of the family in which the rights of every one are respected and all members are bound together , not through fear or through force of authority , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes of our society . The problem before our civilization is whether such a democratic ethical type of the family can become generalized and offer a stable family life to our whole population . It is evident that in order to do this there must be not only a considerable development of the spirit of equality but , even more , a considerable development of social intelligence and ethical character in the minds of the people . To construct a stable family life of this character , however , ? which is apparently the only type that will meet the demands of modern civilization , ? is not an impossibility , but is a delicate and difficult task which will require all the // resources of the state , the school , and the church . There is , however , no ground as yet for pessimism regarding the future of our family life ; rather all its instability and demoralization of the present are simply incident , we must believe , to the achievement of a higher type of the family than the world has yet seen . Such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought and effort or without wise social leadership . The Reconstruction of the Family. ? That instability of the family ? with divorce , so far as it is an expression of that instability ? is an evil in society is implied in all that has thus far been said concerning the origin , development , and functions of the family as an institution . While all the preceding chapters amount to an argument on this question , a word further may not be out of place . It is often said by those who favor free divorce , that such divorce will prevent immorality in society ; but it must be pointed out that this has not been the experience in other countries and ages than our own . As we have already seen , in proportion as divorce grew in Rome , for example , sexual immorality of all sorts increased . Weak family ties seem to encourage lax relations between the sexes generally , and to destroy the social ideal of the sanctity of the marriage bond . Again , those who advocate free divorce claim that such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as of the husband and wife . While it may be admitted that in many cases it is desirable to dissolve the family bonds for the sake of the children , still all investigations seem to show that the instability of the family is itself one of the greatest sources of child delinquency and dependency in those communities where such instability is pronounced . In an investigation made by the writer in the year 1909 , it was found that out of 7575 children in thirty-four State Reform Schools , 29.6 per cent came from families in which there had been divorce or desertion , 33 per cent in which either father or mother was dead , while 38 per cent ( including a few cases which overlapped the first two classes ) came from homes demoralized by drink , vice , or crime . In only a negligible per cent of the cases did these Reform School // children have a normal family life . Out of 4278 children investigated in four juvenile courts , it was found that 23.7 per cent of this number came from families in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while 27.8 per cent came from families in which one or both parents were dead . Even in thirty-two institutions for dependent children it was found that 24.7 per cent of the inmates were from homes in which there had been desertion or divorce , while only 47.5 per cent were either orphans or half orphans . Many similar statistics have been collected by social workers later , showing that the children of separated or divorced parents are much more apt to drift into poverty , vice , or crime , that is , into the unsocialized classes , than children who do not come from such disrupted homes . The general conclusion of social workers is that a normal family life in which the child has the care of both parents is the best possible guarantee for the proper adjustment of the child to society ; for hitherto all experiments in the proper care and upbringing of children in institutions have been , comparatively speaking , failures . We are not warranted , therefore , in drawing any other conclusion than that the welfare of the child as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stability of the family . If the real evil is not divorce , but the decay of the family life , however , it is idle to suppose that superficial remedies will suffice . Nothing short of radical social reconstruction , such as will put an end to all of the disintegrating influences which are now affecting the home , whether industrial , political , or moral , will solve the problem of the modern family . The problem of the family , in other words , like all other social problems , is bound up with the total conditions of modern social life . As has often been emphasized , present social problems are all interdependent and really but phases of one larger problem , the " Social Problem , " the problem of the relations of men to one another . Legislation can do little , in one sense , to correct the real evil . That it can do nothing , and that an attitude of laissez-faire is justified upon this question , is , of course , not true . Legislation , if properly applied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // marriage and divorce can accomplish something . As we have already noted , the difference between the few divorces of Canada and England , and the many divorces of the United States , is largely due to a difference of laws . But of course we must not assume that there is a like difference in the state of the family life of the two countries . Legislation , in other words , may simply ignore social evils , and prohibit in appearance things which persist in reality . While it is not too much to say that the divorce laws of many of our states are a crime against civilization , because they have set low moral standards , yet the making of these laws stricter may not of itself greatly check the decay of the family . Let us note , however , some of the proposed reforms which seem feasible with reference to marriage and divorce , because they illustrate the difficulties and the principles of scientific social reconstruction in general . Proposed Legislative and Judicial Remedies for the Divorce Evil . ( I ) The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and marriage law , to be enacted by the Federal Congress and administered by the Federal courts . The enactment of such a law , however , would require an amendment to the Federal Constitution . Assuming that such amendment is possible , a uniform marriage and divorce law for the whole United States is certainly desirable ; for such a fundamental institution as the family should not be left to the regulation of local administrative areas , such as our states are . The family is not a state concern , but a national concern . However , as has already been implied , the family problem is so deep that a mere transfer of the laws governing marriage and divorce from the statute books of the states to the statute books of the nation would make no material difference in the problem . There can be no question but that the states which now lead in divorce would continue to lead . In Switzerland , for example , where the cantons had the right to regulate divorce prior to 1876 , in I906 , after thirty years of uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every 7 marriages , while the canton of Valais had one divorce to every 250 marriages . Nevertheless , while we must not expect too great results to follow , uniform divorce and // marriage laws are important enough to be worth working for . It is possible that such uniformity may be brought about through the cooperative action of our states rather than through an amendment to the Federal Constitution . ( 2 ) Of more importance than uniformity in divorce laws , however , is reform in judicial procedure in trying divorce cases . We have already seen that very often divorce cases are rushed through our courts , not only without solemnity , but even without adequate knowledge of the merits of the cases . This has resulted , in many instances , in divorce being granted , in effect , upon mutual consent of the parties ? something never contemplated by our divorce legislation , lax though it be . Two reforms may be suggested which would undoubtedly correct the worst of these evils . The first is the appointment , in every court which tries divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to inquire carefully into every application for divorce to see whether the alleged grounds actually exist and whether there is an absence of collusion or fraud , and then to advise the judge . In some courts the appointment of such divorce proctors has resulted in cutting down the number of divorces granted nearly thirty per cent in a single year , a conclusive proof that many divorces had previously been granted upon inadequate grounds or through collusion or fraud . A second reform in judicial procedure in granting divorce , more radical than the first , would be to put the matter of divorce in the hands of special Courts of Domestic Relations . Such courts already exist in several cities , but hitherto their control over divorce cases has been limited . It would seem that all applications for the dissolution of family bonds , whether between husband and wife , or parents and children , should come , in the first instance , before special tribunals which should carefully investigate the cases to see whether or not the welfare of society would be served by the breaking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts could fully establish the facts and make recommendations to the judges , while the judges in turn could , in many instances , reconcile the parties and thus // preserve the unity of the family . This has been done very successfully in a large number of instances by the Courts of Domestic Relations in Chicago and other cities . Similar practices in Switzerland also have been found effective in bringing about the reconciliation of many parties seeking divorce . Such work by the courts is truly reconstructive of the family , and can not be too highly commended . The trouble is that in a majority of cases it comes too late . As yet , moreover , such Courts of Domestic Relations exist only in very large cities ; and even where they exist , they have only a limited jurisdiction in matters affecting the family . ( 3 ) A third legislative remedy for the divorce evil would be lessening the number of legal grounds for absolute divorce . There can be no question but that such legislation is desirable in many of our states . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too far , and of simply forcing the evil beneath the surface . A practicable divorce law in a majority of our states at the present time would probably have to recognize the five or six most serious grounds for divorce which have already been discussed in this chapter , and for which over ninety per cent of the divorces are granted . Stricter laws , however , in many of our states , would serve to set higher standards for the family life and indirectly might thus do considerable to lessen the instability of the family . ( q ) Restrictions upon remarriage of divorced parties might also do something to reduce the instability of the family . Statistics in the United States seem to indicate that from thirty to fifty per cent of divorced persons remarry , according to the locality . While no large proportion of divorces are sought for the purpose of immediate remarriage , yet some are , and the number is apparently increasing . If restrictions upon remarriage were permanent , this would amount to making divorce merely legal separation , and might be at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the other hand , the lax laws of some of our states which permit immediate remarriage upon divorce make possible frequent remarriage on the part of divorce " repeaters " and result in affronts to public decency . Stu156 THE PROBLEM OF THE MODERN FAMILY dents of divorce , therefore , are practically unanimous in the opinion that a reasonable time should elapse after a divorce decree has been granted before remarriage is permitted . This is probably best secured by what is known as the nisi , or conditional , decree of divorce , which becomes absolute , permitting remarriage , only after a period of one or two years , thus allowing the divorced parties to effect reconciliation within that time without the formality of remarriage . ( 5 ) Restrictions upon marriage are advocated by certain writers as a remedy for the instability of the family . It is said that the real evil is not the divorce evil , but the marriage evil , and that we should have very few divorces in society if we had only wise marriages . This may be granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do much to make our family life more stable . Wise marriages should , of course , be in every way encouraged by society , but thus far it has been found possible to do but little in a legal way to bring about such marriages . To be sure , our marriage laws are still lax , and they should do more than they do ; but at best marriage laws could act only negatively , that is , they can prevent to some extent unwise marriages , but can do very little to secure wise ones . The laws might safely forbid not only the marriage of persons of immature age , of defectives , and of those afflicted with contagious diseases , but also probably the marriage of persons of too great difference in age , or of different races . Farther than this the laws could scarcely go with safety . In all countries where property restrictions have been put upon marriage , or where the legal age of marriage has been placed too high , a great increase in illegitimacy has resulted . Indeed , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage among all normal persons in society and certainly not to make marriage difficult for such . Conclusions Regarding the Reconstruction of the Family. ? What law can not accomplish or even safely attempt , however , education , public opinion , and social standards can . It is to the power of these rather than of mere legislation that we must look for stable and adequate reconstruction of any institution ; for back of all institutions // stand the habits , opinions , and standards of the mass of individuals . The chief thing which is wrong with American family life is after all the " mores , " the social standards , of the American people in regard to the family . Now , the " mores " of a people can be changed for the better only in one way ? and that is through a process of learning on the part of the mass of the people . There are several ways , of course , in which a people may learn , but the safest and most economical way is through the systematic education of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals , especially of the young , is the key to the scientific reconstruction of society . Let us consider , then , more in detail social education as a means of reconstructing our family life . Social Education and the Reconstruction of the Family . Education , unlike legislation , can easily change the habits , opinions , and standards of individuals , because the whole process of education is essentially a process of taking on certain habits , ideas , and ideals as preparation for life . Legislation , on the other hand , is necessarily external and coercive . It affects the individual for the most part too late in life to change radically his habits or even his opinions . It is for this reason that legislation has so many shortcomings as an instrument of social reconstruction or reform . Of course , neither education nor legislation should be neglected in social reconstruction . Both are necessary and supplement each other . Wise legislation must rest upon the opinions , ideals , and habits of the people already formed through education . On the other hand no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by appropriate legislation . In this matter of reconstructing our family life , therefore , the main reliance must be placed upon the education which the school , the church , and the home can give to the rising generation . Until children are taught to look upon the family as a socially necessary and therefore sacred institution , until they are taught to look upon marriage as something other than an act to suit their own convenience and pleasure , we must expect that our family life will be unstable . While the reconstruction of our family life practically involves the reconstruction of our whole social life , as has already been pointed out , yet // the key to the situation in any event is the social education of the young , because only through such education can right ideals concerning marriage and the family be acquired . The importance of a pure and wholesome family life should , therefore , be emphasized by our whole system of public education from beginning to end . This can readily be done even in the lowest grades through throwing the emphasis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all social activities and relationships . Here , of course , would enter instruction in the domestic sciences and arts in our public schools ; also education for parenthood so far as it is practicable to give such education in the public schools . The institution in society , however , which is especially charged with the task of conserving and propagating social ideals is the church . It is evident that a large responsibility for right ideals concerning marriage and the family must rest upon the church . Unless the church teaches such ideals , other institutions in society will not teach them to any extent . So far as the Christian church is concerned , it may be suggested that the first social task of the present church should be , as it was of the primitive church , the reconstituting of a stable and pure family life . It may be admitted , however , that the chief education along these lines must come in the home itself . Only there can the truest respect for marriage and the family be effectively inculcated in the young . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect , that we can not expect that the children in them will receive the right ideas from their home life . Hence the importance of supplementing the moral education along these lines which has hitherto been given mainly in the home , by explicit education in our public schools and in our Sunday schools . The situation is , however , not so difficult as might seem , for we must remember that imitation in society moves from the socially superior to the socially inferior classes . Proper social leadership in this matter of educating the child adequately in the school , the church , and the home in everything which pertains to the family would insure a great improvement within a single generation . // There is no reason , then , for pessimism ; but it is evident that effective work along this line has hardly yet begun . A Normal Family Life is one which continues , preserves , and en-hances human life . It evidently requires not only proper physical conditions , sufficient income to maintain a decent standard of living , ' and ethical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , consideration of the child . It is this last which marks the fully social-ized family ; for the welfare of the race and of society is bound up with the welfare of the child . Child welfare may , indeed , in one sense be said to be the central problem of civilization . For this reason , the child has always been and must continue to be the center of gravity , so to speak , in any normal family life . Any discussion of the family , therefore , which fails to make the welfare of the child that is , or may be , born there the matter of the highest importance in the family life misses the whole point . On the other hand , any discussion of child welfare which fails to recognize the family as the normal environment of the child also misses the point . For so-called children 's institutions , juvenile courts , and other child-saving agencies are very inadequate substitutes for a normal home . The securing of a normal family life for all classes is , then , the indispensable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , a normal family life must be centered in the child . From this point of view the way which must be followed to secure the solution of the many problems connected with our family life be-comes clear . For example , whether a particular family should be dissolved or not is a matter which should be decided upon the basis , not primarily of the happiness of husband and wife , but rather of the welfare of the children involved ; and society , of course , can not afford to set up one standard for couples with children and another standard for couples without children , as that would place a premium upon childlessness . Again , the labor of married women outside of the home , 16o THE PROBLEM OF THE MODERN FAMILY the labor of children themselves , wages and hours of breadwinners , and even the building of our cities must be regulated upon the basis of child welfare . Finally , the unsocialized individualism of our " mores " with reference to marriage and the family must be modified for the sake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all , for the instability of the American family is rooted not so much in our industrial conditions as in our " mores , " as is shown by such facts as that divorces usually increase with economic prosperity , and that American industrial development is of the same general type as that of European countries which have a more stable family life . It may be pointed out that in emphasizing child welfare as the basis for deciding problems of the family , there is no necessary sacrifice of the moral and social welfare of adults . Any system of morality which is social in its aim must place a premium upon the development of altruism . The moral character of adults , in other words , can best be safeguarded by emphasizing the claims which society and the race have upon the individual ; and the child stands , as we have seen , for society and the race , and so for the development of the higher altruism . General Conclusions for Social Reconstruction. ? The study of the problem of reconstructing our family life furnishes certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Social reconstruction , as we have seen from the problem of reconstructing our family life , always involves reconstructing the " mores . " But this can not be accomplished by mere force or coercive legislation . It can be accomplished only by a process of educating the whole people . The press , the school , and the church must be the prime agents for accomplishing such a process of education . Free public discussion and the free formation of public , opinion under the guidance of social leaders are also necessary before a definite social decision can be reached which will change social standards . Only when public opinion and public sentiment have so crystallized that social standards have already practically changed , is it wise to pass coercive laws . Even then laws must be supported by the active // forces of government , education , morality , and religion , if they are to be effective and the habits of the people definitely changed . All agencies of social control , in other words , must be enlisted . More-over , economic conditions and conditions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be favorable to the new standards if they are to be successful . If , on the other hand , laws are enacted without such a process of popular education and without the free formation of a public opinion , they will not represent the popular will and must sooner or later prove a failure . The same thing is evidently true if they are not actively supported by political , educa-tional , moral , and religious agencies after enactment , and if appro-priate changes in the material conditions of life are not made . In stable social reconstruction society must move as a unit ; but social education is the key to its successful prosecution . CHAPTER IX THE GROWTH OF POPULATION Mass as a Factor in Social Evolution. ? Mass is a factor in the survival of a social group . Other things being equal , that group will stand the best chance of surviving which has the greatest numbers . In a large and growing population , also , competition will be keener , selection more stringent , and hence the level of efficiency will tend to rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contact of numbers , " as Professor Keller says ; however , not so much because of the two facts just mentioned , as because of the fact that the larger the mass of a given group the greater can be the industrial and cultural division of labor . This means higher , more complex social co-operation and so greater progress in industry and in civilization . With the proper organization and division of labor of large numbers the mastery over nature becomes easier . For this reason the higher types of industry and of civilization have depended upon the growth of numbers as one important factor . As we pass from savagery to civilization we find population constantly increasing . Each of the lowest savage hordes has scarcely ever more than forty or fifty individuals , and not until high civilization is reached do we find nations numbering many millions . There is thus an intimate connection between numbers and a high state of civilization . Perhaps the chief reason for this is that the human mind gets practically all of its development through contact with other minds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both mental and cultural development . Provided there is relatively free intercommunication maintained between individuals , mental interstimulation can be immensely more rich , varied , and intense in a large 164 // population than in a small one . The number and variety of ideas in circulation in a large group is greatly increased , and hence the opportunities for the selection of valuable ideas is also increased . Hence inventions of all sorts are stimulated by the increased contacts and needs of great masses of men . On the other hand , it is obvious that population may exceed resources , and that its increase makes the social life and its problems more complex and may greatly intensify the struggle or competition between individuals and groups . The questions which center around the growth of population , accordingly , are among the most important with which sociology has to deal . These questions are , of course , closely connected with the family life , since the growth of population in the world as a whole is dependent upon the excess of births over deaths . However , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a national question that perhaps it will be best to study it from the standpoint of the national group . The population of modern national groups , the influences which augment and deter the growth of population , and the laws of population in general , will be what will concern us in this chapter . Perhaps the greatest problem in connection with population is its quality . A population which has intelligence and moral character is usually able to meet successfully its problems , at least those within its numbers . This problem of the quality of population is , however , only partly a biological problem , for intelligence and character in individuals are even more a product of culture than of hereditary qualities . However , the advocates of eugenics have forcibly called attention to the vital importance of hereditary traits in populations . This must be conceded , even if we regard culture as the more important in the determination of intelligence and character . But the problem of this chapter is the growth of numbers and the factors which enter into that growth . Population Statistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will show the growth of population in'some of r66 THE GROWTH OF POPULATION the largest nations of the world since the beginning of the nineteenth century ' . The table shows that while the population of nearly all these nations increased rapidly in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries , the rate of increase has been relatively unequal . Japan is now the most rapidly increasing in population of all the great powers . If the annual rate of increase of 1930 ? 40 should continue , which is unlikely , Russia 's population in the year 2000 would be in the neighborhood of 250,000,000 ; Germany 's population , not counting annexations , would reach 1oo,000,000 ; while France 's probable population in the year 2000 , if it continues to increase only at its present slow rate , would be but 42,000,000 . France , indeed , now faces the possibility of depopulation , since in the four years 1935 ? 38 there was every year an excess of deaths over births . World wars render all forecasts of population uncertain , but it is probable that , owing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth of population in different nations will remain unequal . // Inasmuch as the mere element of numbers is one of the large factors in the strength and efficiency of any nation , population growth is a highly important matter . It is probable that the nations that lead in population will lead in industrial and cultural development . Practical statesmanship has often overemphasized numbers , but it is a factor which can not be neglected in sociological thinking . The usual estimate of the present world population is about 2,000 , - 000,000 . It is reliably estimated that the population of the world has quadrupled in less than three centuries . While such a rapid rate of increase is improbable in the future , yet even a very much smaller increase will create many new problems . Many students of population estimate that the United States will have a population of 150,000,000 in the year 2000 . We have already seen that Russia 's population may equal 250,000,000 by that year . India already has a population of over 350,000,000 , and it is probable that China 's population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Second World War , its territory with those annexations would have a population of over 350,000,000 . The student will have no difficulty in seeing that the immense population of these great powers introduces into the world 's social and political future a momentous factor whose significance we probably apprehend imperfectly . If some nations or races limit their numbers , they will evidently be at a disadvantage in the struggle for existence , other factors being equal , with nations or races which do not limit their numbers . Moreover , the unevenness of cultural attainments of the different nations makes the problem much more difficult for any practical solution . It must be faced , however , in any attempt to understand world-wide social and political conditions . Hence the need of a careful study of vital statistics of the different nations in order to understand the working of this factor . Population and Vital Statistics. ? The population statistics and vital statistics of various civilized countries show : ( I ) The population of all civilized countries , with one or two exceptions , has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Previous to that time we have no statistics that are reliable , i68 THE GROWTH OF POPULATION but it seems probable that the population of Europe stood practically stationary during the Middle Ages and increased only slowly down to the nineteenth century ; but during the nineteenth century the pop-ulation of the leading industrial nations increased very rapidly . This was due primarily , without doubt , to improved economic conditions , which made it possible for a larger population to subsist within a given area . Back of these improved economic conditions , however , has been increased scientific knowledge of ways of mastering physical nature , and accompanying them has been a very greatly decreased death rate , due in part at least to the advance of medical science . This increase in population has been due , not to an increase in birth rate , but to a decreased death rate . During the nineteenth cen-tury the death rate decreased markedly in practically all civilized countries . As we have already noted , this was due primarily to im-proved living conditions , particularly in the food , clothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also due in no small part to the advance in medical science , especially that branch of it known as " public sanita-tion . " Because the death rate decreases with improved material con-ditions , and probably also with improved moral conditions , it is a relatively good measure of the material civilization or progress of a people . It should be noted that the death rate is measured by the number of deaths that occur annually per thousand in a given popu-lation . The death rate of the countries most advanced in sanitary science and in industrial improvement apparently tends to establish itself around fifteen per thousand annually . ' The birth rate of civilized countries also declined markedly dur-ing the nineteenth century , especially during the latter half . On the whole , this was a good thing . The birth rate should decrease with the death rate . This leaves more energy to be used in other things ; but when the birth rate falls more rapidly than the death rate or falls bePOPULATION // yond a certain point , it is evident that the normal growth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be threatened . While an excessively high birth rate is a sign of low culture on the whole , on the other hand an excessively low birth rate is a sign of physical and probably moral degeneracy in the population . When the birth rate is lower than the death rate in a given population , it is evident that the population is on the way to extinction . Such a birth rate is manifestly abnormal . In order that a birth rate be normal , therefore , it must be sufficiently above the death rate to provide for the normal growth of the population . On the whole , it seems safe to conclude that we have no better index of the vitality of a people , that is , of their capacity to survive , than the excess of births over deaths . This has sometimes been called " the vitality index . " Such an excess of births over deaths is a fairly trustworthy index of the vitality of a population , because if its biological conditions are poor , no matter how high the birth rate may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the excess of births over deaths , therefore , relatively low . Vital statistics are , therefore , when sociologically interpreted , an indication of more than the mere health or even the material condition of a given population . Probably there are no social facts from which we may gather a clearer insight into the social conditions of a given population than vital statistics . Without going into the vital statistics of modern nations in any detail , the following tables of birth rates and death rates in three leading European nations will serve to illustrate the decrease in the death rate and the birth rate among civilized people in general , the birth rate being computed the same as the death rate , that is , the number of births that occur annually per thousand in the population . The two tables ( p. 170 ) show , not only that birth rates and death rates have been declining among civilized peoples , but that the decline has been unequal in different peoples . In the case of England and Wales the excess of births over deaths in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annually ; in the case of Germany , 14.5 ; while for France it was only 1. o . In the years just before World // War II the excess of births over deaths in Germany was larger than in England and Wales . During the same period the excess of births over deaths in France was insignificant ; and in some years ( 1935-1938 ) the number of deaths in France has actually exceeded the number of births . During World War I the birth rate of France fell nearly one half ? to 10 per thousand annually . The causes of the stationary population of France may be mainly economic , although all factors which influence the family life in any degree must also influence the birth rate . For a number of years certain economic conditions of France have not been favorable to the growth of a large population , and at the same time the law necessitating the equal division of the family 's property among children has tended to encourage small families , especially in the agricultural population . Unquestionably , however , other factors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in France as well as in all other populations that are decreasing in numbers . It would be well for the student to note at this point that all these factors affecting birth rates and death rates among modern peoples are social , that is , are in a people 's culture or in objective social conditions . They are not purely biological , as they might be in an animal group . The census of 1940 reported a death rate for the United States , in the population taken as a whole , of 1 0.8 , while the birth rate for the // same year was reported as 17.9 . This indicated an excess of births over deaths of 7.1 per thousand of population annually , which is sufficient for reasonable population growth , if we judge by the crude birth rate and the crude death rate . However , the population growth of the future can not be calculated from crude vital statistics . That must be calculated from what statisticians call " the net reproduction rate , " which is a measure of the potential rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reproduction rate of roo would indicate a stationary population . For the first time in our history the census of 1940 indicated a net reproduction rate of only 96 , while in 1930 it was 111 . The recent vital statistics of the United States , therefore , indicate a possible decrease in population in the near future . This is not wholly a new trend and has been expected by vital statisticians for some time . Let us note some of the historical facts . The Decrease in the Native White Stock in the United States . For a number of decades United States Census statistics seem to indicate that the native white stock in the Northern states is not keeping up its numbers . This is suggested by the decrease in size of the average family in the United States . The average size of the family in the United States in 185o was 5.6 persons ; in 1900 , 4.7 ; in 1930 , 4.1 ; and in 1940 , 3.8 . This is the average population per occupied dwelling unit , and varied from 3.2 in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statistics of certain New England states , such as Massachusetts and New Hampshire , show the same general trend among the native white population born of native parents . In 1920 , for example ; the death rate among the native-born in Massachusetts was 12.8 , while the native-born had a birth rate of only 14.9 . Thus among the nativeborn , the number of births was greater than the number of deaths by only 2.1 per thousand of their population annually . Among the foreign-born in Massachusetts in 1920 , however , the birth rate was 43.4 while the death rate was 15.5 . Through a number of decades the vital statistics of Massachusetts indicated that the older stock in its populat ion was dying out and was gradually being replaced by the children and descendants of recent immigrants . // Until recently , the birth rate among the foreign-born in the United States has often been twice as high as among the native-born . In part this was due to the fact that the foreign-born population was made up largely of persons in the prime of life . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foreign-born had not adopted the practice of artificially limiting their numbers . The foreign-born now have , however , a larger number of persons of advanced age and many of the foreign born stock have also adopted the custom of artificially limiting the size of the family . Hence , the birth rate among the foreign-born has also been falling rapidly and tends to approximate the conditions found in the older native white stock . This is probably the reason why the census of 1940 first showed a decline in the net reproduction rate of the population under the norm of Ioo . The vital statistics in the whole Northern tier of states show everywhere practically the same tendencies ; everywhere we find the older native-born white population failing to hold its own alongside the recent immigrant stock . We must conclude that the birth rate of the older white stock in the United States is declining to such an extent that that element will contribute less and less to our general population in the future . Only the Southern whites present an exception to this generalization . The Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? doubtless mainly because a large majority still live under rural conditions , partly from a lower standard of living , and perhaps partly from family pride , ? keep up their numbers , increasing more rapidly than the Negro population which exists alongside of them . Causes of the Decrease in Birth Rate of the Native White Stock in the United States. ? What , then , are the causes of this decrease in the birth rate of the native white stock in the United States ? It is worth while to inquire briefly into these causes , for they illustrate the factors which are at work in favoring or deterring the growth of population . They are not only of special interest to us as affecting conditions in our own country , but they are typical of the influences which determine the survival or extinction of peoples . // ( r ) Economic conditions are probably at the bottom of the decreasing birth rate in the native white American population . Certain unfavorable economic conditions have developed in this country of recent years for this particular element ; especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population in the United States more rapidly than their income . This has led to later marriages and smaller families . Again , more intense competition along all lines has forced certain elements of the native stock into occupations where wages are low in comparison with the standard of living . It has often been said that this has come about through the increased competition which certain foreign-born have offered to the native white element . The foreign-born have , at any rate , taken rapidly all the places which might be filled by unskilled labor and many of the places filled by skilled labor . The native stock have shrunk from this competition , and have retired for the most part to the more socially honored occupations , such as clerkships in business , the professions , and the like . In many of these occupations , however , as we have already seen , the wages are low as compared with the standards of living maintained by that particular occupational class ; hence , as we have already seen , later marriages and fewer children . Rising standards of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impinged more heavily upon the native stock than upon the foreign-born . It is difficult to suggest a remedy for this condition of affairs . No legislator can devise means of encouraging a class to have large families when by so doing that class would necessarily have to sacrifice some of its standards of living . However , it may be that the native stock can be protected to some extent from competition through reasonable restrictions upon immigration , and it may also be that unreasonable advances in standards of living may be checked , but both of these propositions seem to be of somewhat doubtful nature , because so many other factors enter in. ( 2 ) No doubt the pressure of economic conditions is not responsible for small families in some elements of the native white population in the United States , for oftentimes the smallest families are found among the wealthy , among whom there could be no danger of a large family // lowering the standards of living or pressing upon other economic needs . We must accept as a second factor in the situation , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to be burdened with the care of children . In other countries , and apparently in all ages , the wealthy have been characterized by smaller families than the poor . It might reasonably be argued that these materialistic standards of the wealthy , diffused to the middle classes , have been the main fac-tor in lessening the birth rate of the latter . Indeed , the spread of these standards has usually been prior to the pressure of economic con-ditions . The following table from Bertillon , l showing the number of births per thousand women between fifteen and fifty years of age in Paris , Berlin , and London among the various economic classes , shows that it is not altogether the pressure of economic wants which leads to the limiting of a population : ( 3 ) Besides economic conditions and individual selfishness we must unfortunately add another cause of decreasing birth rate in our population which has been definitely ascertained , and that is vice . Vice cuts the birth rate chiefly through the diseases which accompany it . About 20 per cent of American marriages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of these childless marriages the barrenness is due to venereal diseases . All authorities in medical sociology agree that a large per cent of the young men of the United States become addicted to sex vice before marriage . This serves to disseminate venereal diseases among the general population , especially among innocent women and children . The consequence is , on the one hand , a 1Quoted by Newsholme , Vital Statistics , p. 75. // considerable number of sterile marriages and on the other hand a high infant mortality . It need not be assumed that vice is more prevalent today than in previous generations , but on account of the conditions of our social life diseases which accompany vice are now more widely disseminated than they have been at any time in our previous history ; therefore , even the physical results of vice are different today from what they were a generation or more ago . ( 4 ) Education has been alleged as a cause of decreasing birth rate in the native white American stock . This , however , is true only in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as collected statistics have shown , that if Harvard and other universities depended on children of their alumni for students their attendance would actually decrease in numbers , it is not true that college graduates have had a lower birth rate than the economic and social classes to which they belong . So far as statistics have been collected , indeed , they seem to indicate that the wealthy uneducated are producing fewer children than the educated classes who are grouped with them . The influence decreasing the birth rate among the educated is , therefore , not education itself , but the high standards of living and the luxury of the classes in which they are grouped . f On the other hand , the higher education of women seems to be , down to the present time , operating as a distinct influence to lessen the birth rate among the educated classes for the reason that apparently a majority of educated women do not marry . The higher education has not yet gone far enough , however , to give us any definite facts with which to judge what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the higher education of women is going to lead to a large per cent of the best and most intellectual women in society leading lives of celibacy , then , of course , ultimately the higher education of women will be disastrous to the race . But probably the relative infrequency of marriage among women who are college graduates is a transitory phenomenon due to the fact that neither women nor men are as yet adjusted to the higher education of women . // ( 5 ) Some phases of the " woman 's movement " have without doubt tended to lessen the birth rate in certain sections of American society . Some of the leaders of the woman 's movement have advocated , for example , that women should choose a single life , while others have advocated that families should not have more than two children . Some " birth-control " advocates have gone so far as to claim that if families would have but two children this would be a cure-all for many social troubles . Indeed , this ideal of two children in the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is often spoken of as the " American Idea . " Of course , such teachings could not be without some effect . Without attempting to reply to the advocates of this theory of but two children to a family , it will be sufficient to note that for a population simply to remain stationary three children at least must be born to each family on the average ; otherwise , if only two children are born , as one of the children in many cases will never marry , the population will actually decrease in numbers . Under the best modern conditions one out of three children now born either fails to live to maturity or fails for other reasons to reproduce . There must be , therefore , more than three children born to the average family for a population to grow . From the sociological point of view the ideal family would seem to be one in which from three to six children are born . ( 6 ) Finally , not all of the childless and small families in the native American stock are due by any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have been mentioned . There are also certain other obscure physiological causes at work producing sterility in American women . The sterility of American women is greater than that in any other civilized population , even apart from the causes which have just been mentioned . Some say this is due to physical deterioration in the native white American stock , and there are other things which seem to point in that direction . It may be , however , that this deterioration is in no sense racial , but only individual , affecting certain individuals who lead a relatively unnatural life . Our American civilization puts a great strain upon certain elements of our popCAUSES // Illation , and this strain in many cases falls even more upon the women than upon the men . The social life of the American people , in other words , is oftentimes such as to produce exhaustion and physical degeneracy , and this shows itself in the women of a population first of all in sterility . It is evident that the remedy for this cause is a more natural and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is possible to bring this about . Thus , the causes which influence the birth rate arc evidently very complex . In the main they are economic and cultural among all peoples , but there is no reason to believe that economic causes act alone in determining the birth rate , nor is there any reason to believe that the psychological and biological causes may be in any way derived from the economic . But mingled with industrial conditions , operating as causes , are certain social traditions and biological factors that have to be considered as in the main independent . It is furthermore evident that the causes which lead to the decline and extinction of any population , whether civilized or uncivilized , are complex . All efforts to explain the extinction of peoples of antiquity , or the decline of modern nature peoples , such as some North American Indians and the Polynesians , through any single set of causes , must be looked at as unscientific . It can readily be shown that in all these cases the causes of the decline of the birth rate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not reducible to any single set of causes . Causes which Influence the Death Rate. ? Before we can fully understand the causes of the growth of a population , that is , of the surplus of births over deaths , we must understand something also about the things which influence the death rate as well as the things which influence the birth rate , because , let it be borne in mind , the growth of a given population ( excluding immigration always ) is due to the combined working of these two factors . Within certain limits the death rate is more easily controlled than the birth rate . It is very difficult for society deliberately to set about to increase the birth rate , but it is comparatively easy for it to take // deliberate measures to decrease the death rate , because all individuals have a selfish interest in decreasing the death rate ; but the increase of the birth rate does not appeal to the self-interest of individuals . Modern medical science , as we have seen , has done much to decrease the death rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . A century ago a death rate of fifty or sixty per thousand population in urban centers was not unusual , but now the time has come when a death rate of twenty per thousand of the population is considered disgraceful to any community . As we have already seen , the normal death rate of the most enlightened European and American communities tends to establish itself around fifteen per thousand . Of course the sanitary and hygienic conditions which influence the death rate are so numerous that they can not be fully discussed here . But we should consider some of the more general social causes which are often overlooked and which arc of particular interest in sociology . ( I ) World wars have demonstrated once more that war , next after famine and pestilence , is the greatest destructive agency known to man . While previous recent European wars , such as the Franco-Prussian War of 187o-1871 , had comparatively small effects upon the death rates of the countries involved , the reverse was true of World War I. In all the-chief belligerent nations the death rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decreased . Thus France suffered a loss of about seven per cent of its total population in the years 1914-1918 , losing 1,427,000 through deaths in its military forces , and over 1,000,000 through the excess of deaths over births in its civilian population , during the four years of the war . Germany , it is estimated , suffered a total loss , within its geographical boundaries of 1914 , of about 3,500,000 in its population during the four years of World War I , of which number , however , only 1,611,000 was from deaths in its military forces . It is estimated that about 1o,000,00o died in the armies of the whole of Europe during the war , while almost as many more were permanently disabled ? the total wounded being estimated at over 20,000,000 . In addition , perhaps 10,000,000 died in Europe from the diseases and starvation caused by the war . Thus we see that even // in modern war disturbances in economic and sanitary conditions may cause more deaths than wounds received in battle . ( 2 ) As already implied , also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate , especially when economic conditions cause increased cost of the necessities of life and widespread scarcity of food . This cause produces far more deaths in modern nations than any other preventable cause . The doubling of the cost of bread ( luring the World War I was one of its greatest calamities . While in peace modern civilized peoples fear famine but little , there are many classes in the great industrial nations that live upon such a narrow margin of existence that the slightest increase in the cost of the necessities of life means practically the same as a famine to these classes . Statistics , therefore , of all modern countries , and particularly of all great cities , show an increase in sickness and death among the poorer classes in times of economic depression unless generous relief is given . ( 3 ) Other economic causes also greatly affect the death rate , especially industrial accidents and occupational diseases . It is estimated by reliable authorities that in the United States alone 18,000 are killed annually by industrial accidents , and I , 000,000 maimed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases of illness in a year produced by harmful industrial conditions . It is evident from these figures that modern industry is more bloody than many a war , and that in all industrial communities , unless there are the most advanced sanitary and safety appliances , it must swell the death rate considerably . ( 4 ) Climate and season are rather constant factors in the death rate of all communities . The rule here is that in cold and temperate lands the death rate is higher in winter , while in warm and hot lands the death rate is higher in summer . Taking ioo as an arbitrary standard , in Sweden in February deaths rise to i 13 , in August they go down to 79 . In the United States , however , in 1940 the death rate in January was 12.6 and in February 12.5 , and in August 9.3 , while the death rate for the year was io.8 . The period of minimum death rate in the United States seems to be in the summer and autumn .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
