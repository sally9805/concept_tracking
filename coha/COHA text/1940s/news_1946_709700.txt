txt The Department of Agriculture wants most food products freed from price ceilings by September 1 . Tins sentiment for almost complete decontrol of major commodities starts with Secretary Anderson and Is shared by his lieutenants . It is based on these arguments . Prices of farm products , If left unregulated. are bound to decline eventually from their current levels through natural supply-demand relationships . In the long run , farmers will be better off if this decline starts from a " free market " price level rather than from an artificial price structure bolstered by subsidies . Agriculture Department policy is against subsidies . Officials would prefer to remove them completely while demand for farm products is strong enough to boost prices to compensate for loss of such payments . Both the department and organized farm groups would like to see a period of high agricultural prices without Government support . A high price level now would furnish a strong talking-point for maintaining high prices in the future . Within the next month , Mr. Anderson must decide what agricultural commodities remain in such short supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consumer . Commodities not specifically listed by Mr. Anderson for coverage must be decontrolled . The ' single but significant exception to this rule is the group of items whose decontrol or recontrol Congress left for the new three-man Decontrol Board to decide by August 21 . Unless the Board rules otherwise , ceilings will go back on grain , meat , dairy products and cottonseed and soybean. products . If the Board takes no action to recontrol poultry , eggs and leaf tobacco , these farm ' commodities will remain free from ceilings-at least for the present . The Board could recontrol them later if it decided prices were getting out of hand . The hoard , under the law . has specific authority to recontrol these farm products once , but the products would thereafter be subject to the general provisions of the law covering certification of goods in " short supply " by the Agriculture Secretary . The Office of Price Administration 's ardor for holding the price line has been curbed considerably by terms of the law which gives It life until next June 30 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to resist many decontrol proposals of the Secretary of Agriculture . The ** legal advisors are of the opinion that the Decontrol Board does not have the power to recontrol the price of farm products after the Secretary of Agriculture has declared them to be in adequate supply , This interpretation quashes the O.P.A. hope that it might he able to appeal to the Decontrol Board whenever the Agriculture Secretary ordered a specific farm commodity freed from controls . Story on Page 5.1 As decontrol policy becomes crystallized , it is likely that the Department of Agriculture will come out first for removing ceilings on meats , dairy products , sugar and fats and oils . On the first two of these commodities . the Department thinks it can make a good case . Supplies of the second two are tight , and the case for a free price is consequently weaker . When the decontrol arguments have subsided , it would not be surprising to find that Mr. Anderson had backed away from his stand on sugar , and fats and oils , and settled for freeing meats and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 to decide whether prices of meats , dairy products , grain , cottonseed and soybeans should continue to be exempt from price ceilings after August 20 . With the exception of relatively unimportant items not affecting the cost of living or of doing business which must , by law , be decontrolled by the end of the year , the yardstick laid down by Congress to guide the transition to free prices Is " short supply " . As long as commodities remain in short supply , maximum prices 80111 continue . When supplies are ample , price controls arc supposed to go , This leaves open the definition of " short supply " and the question of who is to determine whether stocks of a given product are below demand . Congress attempted partial explanation by including in the O.P.A. extension act its own definition : " en sgri ? cultural commodity shall be deemed to be in short supply unless the supply of such commodity equals or exceeds the requirements for such commodity for the current marketing season . " While stocks of most farm products can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' leaves room for wide official disagreement . Most Agriculture Department experts think higher prices will tend to reduce demand for commodities , especially from foreign countries , and thus help bring supply-demand 4 , equilibrium to the domestic market . They hope that even for scarcer commodities , like meats and dairy products , the point of balance will be reached without carrying prices excessively high . The department will rely on its men star tistical divisions to furnish data on the supply situation of various commodities . Here Is the latest supply picture available from otticial departmental sources : MEAT : Production this year is expected to run close to 23 billion pounds , about the same.as last year. , On the basis .. of ceiling prices itt , , effect June. , 30 , this would not be enough. , to supply demand . ' However , when meat Prices rose ' after ** into a temporary . eclipse , some consumer resistance developed . ' This leisened demand .. Foreign buying of U. S. meat is likely to drop sharply with higher prices . The department 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall , without Government interference at 15% to 20% above the old ceiling prices . The Agriculture Department can be expected to press for decontrol of meats and ending of the complicated meat subsidy program . If the going with O.P.A. gets too tough , Secretary Anderson might settle temporarily for an end of the subsidies with the new ceiling price set high enough to reflect-both the Government payment and at least some of the price advance made by cattle since July I. GRAIN : With a record wheat crop all but in the bag and the largest corn crop in history just around the corner , grain men in the Agriculture Department think there 's no danger of runaway prices for these commodities . The Government planned to ship 250 million bushels of wheat abroad this season , but improved crop ' prospects in other parts of the world plus relatively high prices here may reduce these estimates . Should some export demand evaporate , grain men forecast that ceiling prices may be above actual selling prices and therefore academic and unnecessary . DAIRY PRODUCTS : Despite the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raid milk as last year , there still does n't appear to be enough to give consumers all the milk , butter , cheese , canned milk and ice cream they want and are willing to pay for . This explains the lack of butter during the first half of the year . Milk went into bottles and ice cream , both of which yielded higher profits than butter .. Dairy economists in the Agriculture . Department think that without price control relative prices among various kinds of dairy products will come into adjustment . However , they are worried about the jump of two to three cents a quart in fluid milk brought on by the end of subsidy payments . They fear this may discourage the milk-drinking habit Required by millions during the war . Loss of this market for fluid milk would he a severe blow to the dairy farmer over the long run . This leaveS the milk experts in a quandary . They may want to reinstate a small subsidy for milk with some cutback in price . Should such a program be put back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progressive reduction of the rate of payment and for corn : pensating boosts in prices . For a long term solution to the problem , milk experts of the agricultural agency hope for greater productio . POULTRY AND EGGS : Supplies of both hens and eggs are plentiful enough to head off any sharp upward trend in pricea , the Department of Agriculture thinks . FATS AND OILS : Because of the slump In soybean and flaxseed crops , another small cotton year and the prospect for leas lard this tall and winter ( oiving to lighter weight hogs. ) oils will continue to be one of the two most restricted agricultural items . Best hope for improvement In the supply lies In better oilseed crops abroad and a revival of imports of copra ( for coconut oil ) from the Pacifle area . Meantime , there appears to be sufficient pressure on the limited stocks of fats and oils to push prices beyond the point when even the Agriculture Department thinks they should go . Consequently , the Department will not object strongly to reinstating price controls on soybeans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before August 20 . , SUGA It : Substantial improvement In the supply of sugar available to consumers in this country is said to be many months away , probably sometime in the , spring of 1947 .. So Secretary Anderson will probably concede to the O.P.A. for continued ceilings on this commodity . FRUITS : Peaches , apricots , cherries , plums , apples and moat other fruits will he generally plentiful this slimmer . Supplies of fresh oranges will he smaller than last year but more bananas are being imported . There appears to be nothing in this supply picture to necessitate the return of price controls . O. P.A. already hasdecontrolled fresh pears . Truck crops this year are bountiful and the vegetable experts expect that with nr without O.P.A. ceilings , prices of these foods will he lnwer this summer than last . Measured in overall terms , production of vegetables this summer is forecant at 20 , : , above last year . with particularly large in creases seen for potatoes , green peppers , onions , celery . Production of watermelons and cantaloupes  --  lumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to soar .
