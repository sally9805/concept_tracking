FIFTY degrees below zero , a blizzard blowing , and 200 miles to go . Over frozen muskeg bogs , down creek beds , and up through the bush over rugged moraines go the drivers of the tractor trains , all through the wild Canadian winter , freighting machinery and supplies to the new gold mines of the northern canoe country . For this kind of mushing , which in recent years has conquered the swampy wilderness for heavy traffic , a man has got to be tough . But especially he 's got to be good . That 's why he 's sure to make a real tank soldier . The far north 's new breed of musher is called a cat-skinner . Up around God 's Lake and Hudson Bay there are n't so many catskinners this winter . They 've been joining the Canadian Army in droves , and as soon as they can get a proper rig of machinery they are figuring on starting for Berlin . After all , a tank is nothing but an over- grown , armored cat ? with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cat-skinner rides the cab of a six-ton Caterpillar tractor over trails marked by poles in the drifted snow , with six sleds and a caboose behind and maybe fifty tons of precious freight . On his cat he carries a spare radiator and six barrels of gas . He uses fuel oil for antifreeze and he keeps his engine running for five or six days at a stretch . If it breaks down on him , he rigs a tent over his cat , installs a stove , takes a chew of tobacco and a monkey wrench , and fixes things right on the spot . When he starts out with a cat train , he gets there and he brings it back . You 'll find these north-country men today in a sandy wilderness of tar-paper shacks called Camp Borden , up between Lake Simcoe and Georgian Bay , north of Toronto ? tinkering with those 200 World War tanks which the U. S. Army sent to Canada a few weeks ago . With them are cat-skinners from the western construction crews , drag-line men , clamshell men , bulldozer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manitoba an d Saskatchewan , w h o know their gas engines and Diesels too . If a lad is tractoring a section of wheat land twenty miles from the railroad , he ca n't call the garage when something goes wrong . And when that lad goes to town , he drives his own jallopy . One look at those old tanks we sent to Canada would give Hitler a belly laugh , but another look at the men who are handling them would tone it down . Just let the R. A. F. and London hold out long enough for the tank factories to get going , and the Panzer divisions will have something to tangle with . Take the Fort Garry Horse , for instance . That 's a cavalry regiment from Manitoba , named for the old frontier post which became Winnipeg . In the last war it dashed behind the lines and put a German field battery out of action , with a mounted charge against withering machine-gun fire , one of the great cavalry exploits of modern war . It was a sad , sentimental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when , in September 1939 , the Fort Garry Horse bowed to the inevitable , mobilized as a mechanized outfit , and recruited up to war strength with tractor men , garage mechanics , and cat-skinners . But it was a sadder winter when men who had volunteered for mechanized duty found that they had no machinery to work with . By the end of the summer ( spent guarding German prisoners captured in the mechanized blitzkrieg abroad ) these men were so machinery-hungry that they 'd have started picking their wrist watches apart if something had n't happened . That something was the sale of the old American tanks , which made it possible to bring together the Fort Garry outfit and three other tank regiments at Camp Borden and set them up as Canada 's first armored-vehicle brigade . Obsolete though  | the old hell buggies were , they gave the men something to work on , a means of learning to drive and navigate cross-country , and even for group maneuvers later on . With them these empty-handed regiments could be turned into going concerns . Bright and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depot to get their quota of forty tanks . Experienced tank men , there to show the troopers what to do , just stood by with surprised looks on their faces . The cavalrymen hitched up a few hose connections , poured a little gas in the vacuum tanks , twisted the cranks , climbed aboard , and simply drove the cats away . " Ride ' em , cowboys ! " somebody cried ? and they did . These little six-ton , twoman tanks ( American-made  | on the Renault model ) were tough-looking babies , weathered for more than twenty years in a parking lot at Fort George G. Meade in Maryland , many of their hulls and turrets pitted with machine-gun marks , presumably from the last war . They clattered along on wide steel plates with heavy lugs ( a far cry from the flexible chainlike links of speedy modern tracks ) which slapped on the ground and limited speed to six miles an hour . But the engines and running gear were O.K. ; they had been greased up well when put away . And if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these sands at Camp Borden , that was fine . So much more repair work to be done in the winter . Back at their own quarters , the Fort Garry boys went to work . Within three days , twenty-five of those forty tanks were out in line , purring like kittens , and the rest were well on the way . The boys clattered up and down in the open spaces among the barracks . For a man who has driven a car there are only a few things to catch onto . The controls are almost the same as a car 's , except that you practically sit on the floor and instead of a wheel you have two clutch levers , one for each track . Pull back the right lever , it disengages the clutch of the right tread and turns you in that direction . Unlike most cats , a still harder pull brakes the track , and you make a hairpin turn . It is in rough country that the cat man 's skill comes into play . There the novice can easily tip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the turret above is open . But the experienced man will instinctively spin her when she tips , quickly turn her nose straight down the grade . Anyway , the boys took to the equipment like ducklings to a mud puddle . And old horse soldiers happily realized something : the Northwest still breeds good horse riders ; but the same lads are part of a whole generation which has grown up in North America since the last war , a generation which practically cut its teeth on a spark plug and was weaned on a carburetor . That is something worth remembering in these gloomy war days . Since the disasters of last May , all of us have been centering our thoughts on aviation , on assembly lines , machine tools , and craftsmen who can split a thousandth of an inch . These things are all important , and military aviators have to know their trigonometry . But when armored vehicles are produced , it 's going to be the back-yard and the backcountry mechanics who fight with them . If Britain is to win , there will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take off from the Near East or from a beach-head on the Channel , that 's when you 're likely to hear more of Canada 's cat-skinners , and of their salty , peppery , pint-sized commander , Col. F. F. Worthington . This is one of those sad , pathetic tales of unpreparedness , though it now may have a satisfactory ending . Worthy , as they call him all up and down Canada , was his country 's bug on mechanized equipment , one of those prophets without honor which every country seems to have . The United States had Billy Mitchell , France had De Gaulle , and quite possibly in Germany today there is some ignored seer telling Hitler why he is going to lose the war . When the first World War broke out ,  | Scottish-born Worthington was a young adventurer in Central America ? ship 's engineer , mining engineer , and machine-gunner . Fresh from fighting against Villa for Madero , he went up to Canada and enlisted in the Black Watch . In France he was four times decorated for deeds which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wound up the war as a captain in one of the world 's pioneer armored-car outfits , known as Brutinel 's Brigade . Gen. Raymond Brutinel was a French engineer , living in Canada , who early in the last war foresaw the coming of armored , mechanized warfare . His idea was so outlandish that his outfit had to be equipped by private subscription , with guns obtained in various ways , sometimes illegal . Its original equipment was a two-cylinder Autocar truck , with a steel box built around it , mounting two Colt machine guns . When the masses of British tanks broke through the line on August 8 , 1918 , which Ludendorff called Germany 's blackest day , Brutinel 's Brigade came close behind , with machine guns on trucks , motorcycle side cars and trucks . The battle plan for that day followed precisely the tactics used last June by the German armored divisions in France . Brutinel 's column was to have dashed through and grabbed Roye , a rail center . But the battle that was visualized never quite came off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But that was a tank battle , identical with what the Hun has done now , " Colonel Worthington recalls today . " We showed the bugger the way . It boils me up . It 's almost a shame he did n't have more tanks then , so we 'd have remembered . " WORTHINGTON remembered the tanks . When Canada after the war became even more demilitarized than the United States , he stayed on with the skeleton army , waiting for the war he knew was coming . Worthy was a very popular fellow , but was always talking tanks and mechanized warfare . Kind of eccentric on the subject . Or so people thought . Four years ago the Canadian Army established a " tank school " with Worthington in command . In the spring of 1938 he set up , in a few shacks in the deserted sands of Camp Borden , the Canadian Armoured Fighting Vehicles Training Centre , C.A.S.F. With the beginning of the war , groups of officers and men from tank regiments of the active militia were rushed in for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and maintenance , so they could go back to their own outfits and pass on the knowledge . Even so , lack of equipment made it necessary to do much training with gadgets substituting for the real thing . Most ingenious of these is a device called a " rypa , " a turret which jolts and pitches like the jouncing of a tank , from which the gunner shoots airrifle pellets down a sand-pit range . The lowlands blitzkrieg of last May suddenly brought to Canada the realization that it had done hardly anything about tank warfare . Tank building got underway almost immediately , in the Canadian Pacific Railway shops . Nothing is being said about when the new tanks will be delivered , or what they will be like . But a contract was recently let for nine carloads of pins for caterpiller tracks . Well , I went up to Camp Borden to find out what in the world a nation at war wanted with those old World War clunks , and this story is what I found out . It is a Canadian story , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , too . Our armored vehicles are also on order , and in army maneuvers we use ice trucks . But then again we have our own cat-skinners , and our lads from the mechanized farms , and the boys fixing their flivvers in the back yards ? millions more of them than Canada . A lot of them will be getting together in barracks this winter , eager for machinery to work with . And it begins to look as though , in due course , they will be getting it . At any rate , once the present excitement about production is over , we are going to realize strongly that there is a lot more in preparedness than machine tools . We 're going to realize that the used-car lot and the despised jallopy are among the strongest links in our national defense . You can learn a lot from an old piece of machinery .  |
