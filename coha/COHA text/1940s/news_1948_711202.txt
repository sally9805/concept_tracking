txt The revised defense plan submitted to the Senate Armed Services Committee by Defense Secretary Forrestal seems to be a sensible compromise between what the military chiefs would like to have , in order to be reasonably certain of carrying out their obligation to defend the United States against any possible attack , and a large increase in military expenditures that would strain our national economy and call for reimposition of various wartime controls . The revised plan would expand the Air Force to sixty-six groups , or within four of the maximum General Spaatz and Air Secretary Symington had requested and which the House already has authorized . The four groups to be dropped  --  two light bomber and two troop carrier  --  are primarily attack groups . The eleven new groups that would be added to the previously authorized , but not yet appropriated for , fifty-five-group Air Force would be one fighter and ten heavy bomber groups , the latter the very weapon that will be most likely to deter any wouldbe aggressor from attacking the United States . The revised plan is much less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built around a seventy-group Air Force . Instead of costing $9,000,000,000 more  --  the April 12 estimate of Secretary Forrestal ? the addition to next year 's budget , if the program is adopted , will be $3,481 , - 000,000 . Part of this saving comes from the decision to add to the Air Force by withdrawing 300 ** from reserve and making certain modifications in them instead of contracting for new planes . A great part of the saving , however , comes from modification of previous Army and Navy demands for large increments in their own forces if the Air Force was to . be built to seventy groups . The revised plan , for instance , calls for 116,000 fewer men for the Navy and 47,000 fewer for the Army than the original seventy-group $9,000,000,000 program . When the original estimate of the cost of a " balanced " force was made , it struek many of us as excessive , both as to dollars and as to manpower , for the Army and the Navy . The two older services seemed determined to expand in equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good sense , since the basic idea was to build up the arm that would be most likely to prevent war by posing the threat to any at-. tacker of immediate and heavy retaliation . That the Joint Chiefs of Staff are now able to agree unanimously on the new plan shows what can be done when sufficient pressure is brought to bear . Perhaps there is hope yet for real unification of the services . One mistake we trust Congress will not make , if the expanded Air Force program is adopted , is acceptance of idea that it would make unnecessary reimposition of Selective Service and adoption of Universal Military Training . Secretary Forrestal forcefully stated in his testimony the fact that it does not do that . Just the reverse is true . The new program makes even more necessary the adoption of both measures  --  Selective Service to provide immediately the manpower that will be needed to activate this force , and Universal Military Training to provide the growing reserve that may make unnecessary indefinite continuance of Selective Service . Although the proponents in the House of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an overwhelming vote last week were shouting yesterday " no compromise , " Chairman Gurney of the Senate Armed Services Committee reported that he heard only favorable comment on the revised program among his Senate colleagues . We believe the House would be wise to listen to similar moderate counsel . The program always can be stepped up if the international situation should become more threatening . It would be more difficult to revise it downward once the wheels were set in motion .
