COMMAND <P> ( See Cover ) <P> Last week an air of great decision hung over Washington . To some it even seemed that the commanders and civilians who hold the fate of the U.S. in their hands had decided at last " how the U.S. is going to fight the war . " <P> The decision apparently had to do with the intricate , vital , all-inclusive problem of U.S. manpower ( TIME , Oct. 5 ) -a problem which goes to the roots of global strategy , because the number and kind of fighting men the U.S. elects to place on the battle lines will determine that must and can be done by those remaining in the home arsenal . <P> WPB Chairman Donald Nelson declared that the problem had to be faced , the decision had to be made-and soon . He and the Manpower Commission 's chairman , Paul Vories McNutt , had told a House Committee that the U.S. must screw itself up to the mandatory control of all civilian manpower . But they knew that legislation alone would not solve the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size of the U.S. Army . <P> Precisely this basic decision seemed to have been made just last week-exactly ten months after Pearl Harbor . At least in its essentials , the decision even appeared to have been made-wrapped up and delivered in its minimum detail ( so many weapons for so many men in such &; such a time ) to Donald Nelson , Paul McNutt and other key civilians who had to have the information before they could effectively get on with their jobs . <P> WPB certainly had the impression that for the first time- " the very first time " - it knew exactly what the military expected to be done in a given span . For the first time- " the very first time " - WPB considered that it had a specific , intelligible , practicable schedule of requested production , reasonably keyed to the actual production capacity of the U.S. The men in charge of war production were even able to visualize an overall , master plan for 1943-including a marked increase in the dollar-volume of aircraft , a great increase in the number of heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. air assault on German Europe ( see p. 27 ) . <P> Global Secret ? This apparently belated arrival at vital decisions looked bad for General George Catlett Marshall , the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army , and others in the U.S. high command . In fact , such delay seemed to confirm what many responsible men , at the key controls of the U.S. arsenal , had been saying : that the military , up to last week , had simply lacked any real strategy , any real grasp of the global war , any real plan for winning the war . <P> The Army had an answer . According to military men who should know best , the basic decisions were not so belated ; the Army has long had a plan for global war . All that happened last week , according to these sources , was that General Marshall &; staff at last let Don Nelson and a few other key civilians in on some of the end facts stemming from the Army 's Master Plan .
