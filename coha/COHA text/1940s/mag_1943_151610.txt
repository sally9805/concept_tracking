Most of the 50,000 U.S. newsmen drudge along in their 40-hour-a-week ( usually ) jobs , pushing pencils , punching typewriters , interviewing small fry , reporting the drab doings of civic characters . Tom Treanor was one such unglamorous unfortunate . But last week Tom Treanor was in Chungking . <P> Tom Treanor is a columnist-correspondent , of the same general school as Ernie Pyle ( TIME , May 31 ) . His cozy , comfortable , popular column , paradoxically called The Home Front , appears daily in the Los Angeles Times . <P> His airmailed articles ( to save cable tolls ) are angled for publication six weeks after writing . They are bright vignettes-a picture of the five Italian bootleggers who supply the U.S. Army in Ethiopia ; American soldiers borrowing the instruments of a Calcutta dance band and giving Calcuttans a taste of boogie-woogie . <P> Tall , handsome Thomas Stanly Treanor is 35 years old , with a mop of jet-black hair and a shy face . He started out in routine fashion , reporting for Hearst papers in Los Angeles ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times as woman's-page editor , in 1940 got his Home Front column to write . <P> In April 1942 , he was on a tour of defense plants , when he decided to be a war correspondent . He wired the Times , asked if it would pay his daily living expenses if he could get a free bomber ride to the Middle East . The Times wired him $1,500 and its blessing . Treanor invested $1,250 in a Pan American Airways ticket , arrived in Cairo as Nazi Marshal Rommel approached Alexandria . <P> No Insignia . The British refused to accredit him . His claim that he was the only correspondent from a paper west of the Mississippi failed to impress them . Why , they said , we 've got plenty of correspondents from west of the Mississippi - five from Chicago , for instance . Tom Treanor was not permitted to go near the front . <P> He went anyway . For 70 he bought a pair of correspondents ' shoulder insignia . He borrowed a British military truck , got to the lines , got back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was gone . He sent letters to the Times telling all . The British stripped him of his illegal insignia . <P> Then he nosed around a rear R.A.F. base , finally wangled a free bomber ride to Malta , then to Gibraltar . On the way back to Egypt , he saw the bombing of Navarino Bay . The British P.R.O.s were furious , forbade him to ride in combat planes . <P> No Trouble . Undaunted , Correspond ent Treanor sidled up to some New Zealanders , was taken along into the Battle of El Alamein . Treanor went with them into enemy gunfire , saw five days of the battle before the British discovered him . This time they complained to the U.S. Army . Treanor was ordered by his paper to leave the Near East , fast . The first plane out was one bound for India . Treanor hopped it . <P> In India , he was finally accredited . He saw jungle fighting , in his spare time interviewed maharajas . He went along when U.S. bombers plastered Rangoon , finally went across the Himalayas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned , he can go on being a foreign correspondent forever . Probably no paper ever got war coverage as cheaply . Paid an estimated $125 a week , Treanor gets along on $10 a day expense money , even in expensive Cairo , where it costs most correspondents three times as much .
