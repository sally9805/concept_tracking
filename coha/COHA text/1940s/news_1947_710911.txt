txt To me the death of " Baron " Warn comes as a shock . Although my senior by many years he was a companion on many occasions . We worked on neighboring journals and exchanged pleasantries at the " tea time " hour over at the Artists aid Writers Club . We seemed to speak the same language . We enjoyed his company because he was a realist , because he was a master of his particular job , generous in his advice to his younger colleagues , a gentleman in presenting his views . He had the rare quality of giving without seeming to do so . Many a young political writer sat at his table and learned . Some stars in the profession of journalism ! are conscious of the weight they throw ; W. Axel Warn was never one of them . Rather he seemed an humble fellow , who wanted to listen rather than to talk . Perhaps that was the very reason why he was foremost in his field , a confidant of all big figures in political life . To me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as reporting was concerned . We thought the world of nim as a man , as a great journalist , as a symbol of what this Gauntry stands for , and needs to understand at this moment more than ever .
