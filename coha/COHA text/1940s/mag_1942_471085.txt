dominant fact about the Pacific JNorthwest is the immense wilderness it still contains . Nearly half the region is covered with fir and pine trees that represent more than half the standing timber in the United States . National Forests alone mantle an expanse as large as the British Isles . These wooded reserves stretch to a thousand horizons . They are dotted with peaks and serried by deep canyons . White summits rise like domes above needled green foothills . Entire New England States could be lost in the portions of this realm that have been set aside as permanent primitive areas in which cabins , roads , and all other manifestations of man 's intrusion , however crude , are taboo . More than forty per cent of the Northwest remains what it was when we took it away from the Indians ? Public Domain . This is because it is chiefly valuable as the source of swift rivers , a habitat for wild animals and spawning salmon , and as a monumental chunk of the United States in original , untrammeled form for Americans of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you spend all your time in the Northwest within Seattle 's city limits , in a Pullman compartment , or on the awninged afterdeck of a yacht cruising across Puget Sound , the wilderness will dominate your vacation . It is omnipresent . It lies just back of the big cities and flanks the main railways for hundreds of miles . Its products and bounty maintain the region 's pioneer economy . The cities of the Northwest are modern and fresh , yet they are distinctive principally because of the wilderness which frames them . Portland and Seattle have never been offended by the story of the exuberant tourist who said it was mighty convenient to have two such nice big settlements so close to the best fishing and camping he ever did see . Both these cities take greater pride in the back country to which they give access than in their own essential worth .

The Museum 's descriptive literature puts first things first and boasts of the view of the mountains before telling about the art masterpieces . Move southward down the coast and you will find that the quality of Portland 's Rose Festival is judged not by the floats and flowers , but by whether the snowy ramparts of Mount Hood , towering two miles above the city , are visible or shrouded in clouds and mist . The Northwest 's supreme attraction is its outdoors . Charley " Silvertip " Sieber once said he reckoned he had as good a chance to meet important folks at his trapping camp below Eagle Cap as in downtown Portland . There is an element of truth in this . Herbert Hoover , Ernest Hemingway , and Justice William 0 . Douglas spend weeks and months in the Northwest and rarely show their faces in any of the cities . The region 's urban pleasures are by no means inferior ; they simply are overshadowed . This has been so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory of the Northwest was the mountain-locked stream near Portland where on a soul-stirring afternoon he caught sixteen Chinook salmon in six hours . The Northwest cherishes many minor epics and one great one , that of Lewis and Clark who brought the American flag across the Rockies and down the Columbia River in 1805 . Monuments and statues and museum collections honor their feat . But you can miss all of these and still understand what that journey really meant ; for many of the sights that met those great frontiersmen 's eyes endure to-day unchanged . Up out of the little town of Salmon , Idaho , twists a narrow wooded road . At its crest , in the Beaverhead National Forest , you can stand on the summit of Lemhi Pass , where Captain Lewis tottered into the camp of the Shoshone Indians andbartered for the food that saved his company from starvation .

Back of you the Columbia River , five miles wide , pushes inexorably out of a corridor lined with timber and ribbed with tributary streams . Lectures , memorials , and tablets fail hopelessly by comparison to tell what must have been in the minds of those ragged adventurers when , after eighteen hungry , trackless months , the fog lifted on a cold November afternoon and they saw the gray seas breaking beyond the bar . A thousand miles by road separate Salmon and Astoria . Other distances in the Northwest are comparable . And this vast domain is a land of contrasts . Streamlined trains clatter past trappers ' bivouacs . The forty-two-storey Smith Tower in Seattle can be seen from Olympic escarpments barricaded by miles of dense " rain forests .

When the generators of the mightiest power project in the world began to turn , the first delivery of Grand Coulee electricity was made not to the huge new aluminum plants downstream but to Ernestine Nanamkin , a squaw at the Nespelam Indian Agency who had purchased a washing machine for the occasion . Montana rises up out of the prairie in a long , gentle incline . On your way westward you will hear at filling stations about Fort Peck . This is an abandoned fur trading post where Army Engineers have reared an earthen barrier four miles long to insure a deep-water channel on the Missouri River . The dam itself is not spectacular , but the empty shack towns that squat on the flats reveal what happens when one hundred million dollars are spent in a wasteland .

Eat at least one meal with the men who soon will be on the job installing turbines and transformers This is recommended at all the big projects still under con-struction . The workers ' mess halls are generally open to visitors and the food , served on an " all you can eat " basis , is wholesome and reasonable .

Ninety miles up the dwindling river , Helena stands at the gateway to the Northern Rockies . From here to the Pacific a series of mammoth wrinkles corrugates the earth .

The excellence of the kitchen has endured , although , incongruously , the special dish is neither bear meat nor salmon trout but rum chiffon pie . The first-class Chinese restaurants which seem so out of place eight hundred miles from a harbor indicate that white men alone did not lay the railroads or dig the mines . For all its vast dimensions , which triple Pennsylvania 's size , Montana has only half a dozen places with populations that run into even five figures . The largest of these is Butte , where 36,964 people live on a hill shot through with shafts and tunnels . Some communities are a discreet distance from the industrial process which maintains them , but Butte encircles the copper mines like a stockade . Dunes of slag frown down on the office buildings and encroach menacingly on the miners ' shabby frame houses . Technically , however , the mines are not in the city at all , for Montana law conveniently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to municipal annexation . Extra taxes have never appealed to the Anaconda Copper Company , so Butte 's boundaries are twisted into a labyrinth to exclude property right at the heart of town . But this gerrymandering applies only to the assessor 's rolls , and the frames above the mine shafts stick up out of Skeleton Hill like gallows , reminding natives and visitors that pine timbers in the tunnels below support Butte physically as surely as the ore hauled out of the tunnels by Butte 's grimy men maintains it economically . One of the shafts is open to tourists . The miners call it a " show mine " and its whitewashed walls will show you what a copper mine is not like . You should ride the cage down into the Leonard Mine though because it is your only approach to the city that lies under Butte , a city of 2700 miles of rocky corridors . Yet above the ground you will find Butte 's story told .

Montana alone has 32,000 miles of trout streams , and both the Butte Chamber of Commerce and the Butte Miners ' Union contribute members to the Izaak Walton League . You had better drive a few miles up toward the rim of the divide on U. S. 91 to take a crack at the Big Hole River yourself , for if you can not fill a creel from Montana 's torrents then you would fail in an aquarium . A special visitor 's fishing license is only a dollar and a half for ten days and a rod and line rent cheaply . Yet for the inquisitive there are sights and scenes in Montana beyond the de-mental experience of hooking a dozen trout . This backwoods State has been roughly used and has dealt hard knocks in return . It was more difficult to push the railroads through here than any other part of the nation . " The trouble with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the graveyards ai n't big enough . " In some of the hinterland communities to-day the first real effort is taking place to soften the grapple between Montana and its people . At Choteau below Bear Top Mountain big , mustached Dick Fabrick toils over the charts and reports which are the key to the future . Fabrick , who is Montana 's representative on the National Resources Planning Board , will point to the rugged panorama outside his window and tell you , " At last we know which of those raw materials we can develop now and which we must leave for later on . " And in another settlement , Hamilton , an immense Public Health Service laboratory has finally perfected a vaccine for the Rocky Mountain spotted fever that has claimed more lives in the outdoors than forest fires , avalanches , and blizzards combined . As fifty-threeyear-old Dr. Ralph Parker talks quietly about the nine men who have died there on the Bitterroot River experimenting with the sheepticks which infest range and woodland , one realizes that not all the frontiers in the Northwest are represented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are plenty of physical frontiers though and in every direction except east Butte confronts the wilderness . To the south the Bitterroots jut into Montana from Idaho . The towering west is barred by the Anaconda Primitive Area to which horseback and foot offer the sole admission . And off in the north , 275 miles away , lies the loveliest of our National Parks ? Glacier . On the route to the park the Federal Bison Range points a warning to hunters and fishermen of what happens when the slaughter of wild life goes unchecked . Survivors of a bloody butchery , the thin remnant of the herds that once mantled Montana , watch disinterestedly from their grazing as the cars hum past . Two museums decorate the tiny winterlocked hamlet of St. Mary on the edge of Glacier Park . One is filled with the customary souvenirs and trinkets of the pioneer whites . The other commemorates the Blackfoot Tribe , which once owned Montana in fee simple . There also is a splendid Indian museum built by the Government twenty miles southeast at Fort Browning , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices . The contrast between the dignity of the Blackfoot collections and such pioneer keepsakes as the rope used by the vigilantes to hang their victims is slightly embarrassing . Preferences are invidious , yet if I could visit only one of our National Parks I would choose Glacier . It has none of the aching dryness of the parks at the southern end of the Rockies , nor are its beauties sombered by a constant overcast as in the Olympic National Park farther west . Paved highways and the main line of the Great Northern lead to its portals . The mountains of Glacier Park loom up as mountains should . It may be heresy to say so , but I believe they are the only American peaks that match Banff and Jasper Park on the other side of the Canadian border . Surrounding plateaus do not reach to their shoulders and subordinate their crowns . They rise above the fringe of timberline in the shape of rocky towers , and their stratified ramparts are seamed and colored like the walls of Angkor Wat . Bighorn sheep and white-bearded goats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these creatures began to be stalked in the days of cameras rather than in the days of rifles . Going-to-the-Sun Highway threads through the park over the hummock of Logan Pass and few roads equal its view of lakes , full-throated streams , forests , and mountains . If you have come equipped you will find the auto camps less expensive than the hotels . No National Park is reasonable of course . Summer business on a summer basis never offers bargains . Gasoline prices are higher than in the rest of the State , although the rich oil fields at Cut Bank are only thirty-one miles away . But you can concede to Glacier that the scenery is worth the toll and , whether you leave the park by car or the Empire Builder , your last glimpse will be of what you paid to see ? the soaring summits of the Northern Rockies hard and sharp against the Montana sky . III The story you hear most often in the dark mass of crags that form a bastion between Idaho and Montana is that of the ascetic college professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living on the same fare as Lewis and Clark . He had become convinced that actual rather than vicarious suffering was essential to an appreciation of the difficulties which confronted America 's pioneers . At last , however , he could stand his scant diet of pemmican and cornmeal no longer . He knocked on the door of a lonely Ranger station in the Salmon National Forest and asked for some milk and a loaf of white bread . The Ranger stared at the gaunt apparition before him . " What 's the trouble , stranger ? " he inquired . " Lost ? " " I 'm following Lewis and Clark , " gasped the exhausted pedagogue . The Ranger thought a minute . " Stranger , " he said , " you 're late . They were through here about one hundred and fifteen years back . " It has been nearly a century and a half now , yet a lesson in our history is the drive on U. S. 91 from Butte southward into Idaho . The Union Pacific takes this route too . From either sedan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twisted terrain which those first frontiersmen penetrated without chart or guide . Rocks and hills bar every point of the compass , yet up Red Rock Creek and the Beaverhead River Lewis and Clark found a course still in use . By the time you reach Pocatello you will be convinced this country was explored by a hardy breed . West of Pocatello the Snake River twists toward Oregon across a wide alluvial plain . Dams store the river 's flow and generate power to pump the water on to thousands of acres . The secret of agriculture in most of the Northwest is combining the soil of the arid plateaus with the accumulation of snow and ice in the mountains . Irrigation canals are siphoned over canyons and cut through tunnels for miles , and Bitterroot blizzards in January presage bumper Boise Valley potato and alfalfa crops in September . " No snow : another mortgage , " is a ranch axiom . I have seen visitors watch in fascination all afternoon while a farmer near Twin Falls diverted water on to his land from the main canal and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Avery Anderson , a Dust Bowl migrant , who had almost paid up his debt to the Farm Security Administration after four years near Boise , said to me , " I guess only somebody from where I come from can look at these irrigation ditches with just the right feeling . " But snow in Idaho means more than next fall 's harvest . It means also skiing at Sun Valley , which ? now that Senator Borah is dead ? unquestionably typifies Idaho to the nation , especially since Sonja Henie has made a movie there . Unlike some celebrated resorts , Sun Valley does not fall short of expectations . It lives up to all the Union Pacific 's fanfare . The ski slopes , great folds of powdery white , are the best in America , and for those whose bones are too brittle or blood too thin there are gentler sports ? golf , archery , hiking , swimming , tennis , and horseback riding . By both highway and branch line , Sun Valley is only sixty-five miles off the main east-and-west transcontinental routes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is definitely not for those traveling on skimpy budgets , four people can bunk in a ski chalet overnight for $1.25 each , and a pot roast dinner at the Challenger Inn sells for 85 cents , provided you are satisfied with Jello for dessert . Yet Sun Valley is not Idaho . Idaho sod provides its ski runs and toboggan chutes , and Idaho mountains are its backdrop . But it is foreign ground in Idaho none the less . The natives of Ketchum , the resort railroad station , eye the Tyrolean-clad strangers frolicking among Sun Valley 's pleasures with the same lack of affinity that the dark tribes of the Congo must feel toward a redoubt full of big-game hunters . There is scant common interest here , and the distance between Ketchum and the long rambling lodge with its modernistic furniture and Hollywood and Park Avenue guests must be gaged by more than ordinary measurements to be understood . The people at Sun Valley polka to concertina music and wear feathered hats , plaid shirts splotched with colors , and play-suits which leave abdomens bare ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way ? In Ketchum at night the Sun Valley visitors , in blazers and Stetsons and Levis , stroll past ranchers in from the range in store clothes with neat white shirts and somber tics . Mental reservations widen the gap . Most of the skiers , either unconsciously or with deliberation , are oblivious to Idaho until Sun Valley 's dazzling ski runs are in sight . Bridge games have been known to last from Chicago or Los Angeles to the junction at Shoshone . A Boise school teacher once remarked that the winter-sports crowd regarded Sun Valley as our forty-ninth State . " Them skiin ' strangers ' pear to have a darn good time up beyond Ketchum , " a stockman near Shoshone volunteered . I asked him if Idaho people did n't stay at Sun Valley too . " Some of ' em works there , " he said . For the location of this most sumptuous of the country 's snow resorts Averell Harriman picked out the edge of the greatest frontier left in the United States . Many places claim to he the last frontier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ description . But this is the last frontier . If Miss Claudette Colbert had the matter-piercing vision of Superman she could look up from her omelet aux confitures in the dining room of Sun Valley Lodge and gaze northward for almost four hundred miles without seeing pavement or telephone poles . From Sun Valley to U. S. 10 , which crosses Idaho 's narrow handle , the Salmon River wilderness stretches off toward Canada in a succession of mile-deep chasms , dense forests , and piled mountains . Few civilized lands contain fastnesses comparable to this . So many deer , elk , and antelope roam its windfalls that the weakest among them die competing for winter forage . Argonauts who brave the Salmon 's corridor of angry rapids , the only access to the heart of the arca , break the barbs off their fishhooks and throw back dozens of trout and salmon alive . Yet formidable though all this sounds , the average traveler can push into at least some of the vast solitude . Pack trips arc readily organized at Sun Valley , or you can trek in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State . At Lewiston an adventurous Irishman named Kyle Mc-Grady will take you on his mailboat Idaho up into Hell 's Canyon , where the Snake River has trenched a chasm 7,900 feet deep . The trip lasts two days , costs $5 , and you can rent blankets from the Lewis and Clark Hotel before setting out . Transition between civilization and frontier is still easy in Idaho , for not so long ago McGrady was a mechanic in a garage . If he makes a success of the wildest mail route in the United States , the garage may be his . Along the gravelly bars of the Snake he will show you prospectors who pan for gold and bring their dust down to Lewiston on the Idaho in chamois-skin pokes , which they weigh on the counter of Mrs. Sapp 's grocery and trade for $35 worth of merchandise for each ounce . Should you undertake a pack trip you can estimate that each day on the trail will cost you $12.50 . This includes horses , bedding , wranglers , and food ? the last epitomized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potatoes , and coffee . All you need bring are yourself and your clothing . And remember if you leave the train at Enterprise or some other jumping-off point accoutered like Errol Flynn pursuing six bandits , your guides will surely put you down as a tenderfoot and your lot will be a hard one . After taking a galaxy of movie people into the Mount Baker country Jack Horton , assistant regional forester , said he guessed a fellow 's woodcraft was in inverse proportion to the amount of fancy equipment he lugged along . Just pack a mackinaw , a plain flannel shirt , some old slacks , and a pair of logger 's boots ; spend most of your money on the boots . This outfit will do in the roughest territory , and it will be passable if you decide to stick to the highways and small-town hotels .

Good roads connect Pendleton with Enterprise , and Enterprise is the portal to the Wallowas , which are replicas of the Alps and even include a towering Matterhorn . Imnaha , on the CCC road to Hell 's Canyon , seems at the end of the world ; yet from Boston to Imnaha the things we do , whether good or bad , are of a piece . In the Irnnaha Garage on a frosty morning Al Duckett is assuring Jack Hogan , U. S. Forest Service , that he will be in Enterprise for the Armistice Day parade , and up the rutted road a notice on the post office door announces that School District No. 16 has renewed the contract of an overworked teacher at $701.25 a year .

The trick riders generally belong to troupes of traveling performers and do not exactly fit a schoolboy 's image of Kit Carson ; but the Indians from the nearby Umatilla Reservation are bona fide and colorful . Two routes lead from Pendleton to the Coast . You can swing through the stock country of central Oregon and then westward , or you can drive down the Columbia River Highway . The Steens Mountains are a tempting reason for the first course . Stop at ranches on this lonely route . The Basque farmhouses are famous for hospitality , for Oregon 's only coffee au Tait , and for Spanish meatballs with hot sauce . Horses thrive here and at least once a year Burns cowhands must herd in the wild mustangs ' : ihich graze the range bare and lure their domesticated brethren of into the wilderness .

There is something terrifying about the sight of axe and bulldozer turning forests of Ponderosa pine into desolate miles of stumps . The figures Dr. Hosch pulls from his pocket on a little card are terrifying too . Bend 's mills are cutting 350,000,000 board feet of lumber annually and at that rate they will start shutting down in ten years . The trees will be gone and the spree ended . Bend , with boulevards now and parks and fat payrolls , will become what the Forest Service calls a " ghost town . " But all through the timber belt ? the greatest timber belt on earth ? you will meet men like Dr. Hosch and Lyle Watts , the regional forester , and E. B. MacNaughton , the State 's leading banker , who arc thinking in terms of sustained yield , of cutting less and planting more so that the woods may endure permanently .

If the interior wilderness is too strenuous , this Pacific Ocean highway is your thoroughfare through the Northwest . On arching viaducts it spans rivers jammed with fish , especially the Rogue and the Umpqua . Beaches and golf courses line the bays and harbors . There are easy walks back into the Coast Mountains , the lowest range in the region ( 4,097 feet ) . The inn accomrnodadons are neat and inexpensive , and for sea-food epicures the trip is bliss .

More myths than fact have been circulated about Portland , located one hundred miles up the Columbia River . It has been romanticized as a Boston of the West and as a conservative citadel in a territory held by congenital Populists . Actually it is neither . ft is no Boston , although its aristocrats live in exclusive old suburbs ( where John Reed was born ) and name the streets after the early merchant princes . It is not conservative , for the aristocrats are outvoted now by the shop girls and sawmill hands , and Portland has given F. D. R. heavier proportionate majorities than have San Francisco or Seattle . Perhaps Portland appears staid and imperturbable because it is predominantly a city of trees and gardens , and insurgency is seldom associated with camellias and rose bushes . Everyone in Portland grows flowers . The land is unlimited , the soil deep , and the spring seasons long and wet and cool . Thick forests stand right at the city line . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flower beds . You may hear about the appraiser who said some of the trees merit higher assessed valuations than the dwellings theyshade .

Beyond the Reed College campus , in the direction of Mount Hood , you can see some of the beginnings of wise use of the soil . In the shadow of the 11,225-foot glacier cone , endless fields of daffodils color land once cut over for logs . Immigrants from Holland have discovered that this margin of the Mount Hood National Forest duplicates the growing conditions of their native land .

The loop twists down through the blossomed Hood River Valley , where the CIO has organized the lumberjacks on the hillsides and the anti-union Associated Farmers hold meetings in the orchards below . Then it joins the Columbia River Highway near Bonneville Dam and three miles above the Columbia Gorge Hotel , which features thick salmon steaks planked and garnished with mashed potatoes .

" But it is not the power phase of the project that stirs wayfarers . They are most interested in the fish ladders . These $7,000,000 concrete stairways get the ascending Chinook salmon past the dam , to their spawning grounds in the Columbia 's headwaters . More than 33,000 fish have been counted thrashing through the artificial passages in a single day . They run in greatest numbers in September and May . The Chinooks , often weighing 60 or 70 pounds , turn the steps into a puree of heaving backs and fins as they struggle to satisfy the inscrutable urge to reach the river 's source . It takes a blas6 visitor indeed to watch this spectacle and not come away limp from excitement . I have seen tourists hover over the ladders from morning until dusk .

No wonder , I mused , that the frontier still seems close to-day . V I have often speculated on what Abe Showaway thinks of the dumpy stone building that perches on a basalt cliff across the Columbia from the Indian village at Celilo .

To come upon these tokens of the wretched Balkan kingdom in that gaunt lava solitude , one hundred and thirteen miles from a trolley line , must have a garish irony even for Abe Showaway with his reservation schooling . Maryhill is in Washington , smallest of the four States of the Northwest , but with by far the biggest population . Yet there is plenty of room for wilderness .

The eating in Seattle is good but not distinctive . For general quality the Olympic Hotel is about the best . At Crawford 's you can eat sea food on the waterfront while you watch fishing dories out on the Sound hauling in halibut , salmon , and shrimps for the next day 's menu . Swedes came to Seattle to cut lumber and there are many tasty smorgasbords . These are the conventional things which you will be expected to do in Seattle . Let me propose a couple of items neither so obvious nor so widely advertised . Go through the public market above the docks and fill your hotel room with plums , celery , apples , and anything else you want to buy . Fruits and vegetables in rich profusion are cheap here , for the Puget Sound lowlands bloom like the Garden of the Lord . In Collier 's Jim Marshall once wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drive out through the suburbs and you will see demonstrated that 47 per cent of Seattle 's people own their own homes and 93 per cent of the residences are single-family units . Maybe a manifestation of this standard of living for the wage earner is the boast of the local labor boss , Dave Beck , that his paneled office on Alaskan Way is every bit as elegant as that occupied by the president of the Northern Pacific . Seattle has the largest municipal water-power system in America . As a propaganda device , tours to the plant'sprojects on the Skagit River are sponsored every summer from June 1st until September 15th . These cover two days , cost only $4.05 a person , and extend deep into the Mount Baker National Forest , 109 miles from Seattle . The tours , although primarily to induce residents to switch their patronage from the local power company to City Light , are open also to visitors . Three trips are made a week , with about 500 people on each . Electric cars bought from a defunct interurban line clatter up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ledges . The crowd eats in big mess halls , and women occupy one dormitory and men another . There are two persons to a room with separate cots , and your roommate may be a college professor or one of Dave Beck 's teamsters . City Light provides towels , clean bedding , generous meals , and even afternoon snacks . Professor Harold J. Laski described the tour as not only a visit to the Cascades for $4.05 , but also " a rare opportunity for investigation into what makes Seattle tick . " Eastward , across the range from Seattle , Wenatchee straddles the upper Columbia in a valley full of apple orchards . Nineteen miles away at Leavenworth is the largest fish hatchery in the world , where you can see spawning Chinooks chauffeured up Icicle Canyon in a fleet of silvery tank trucks . The Forest Service in Wenatchee or ebullient Rufus Woods of the World will outline all sorts of pack trips into the Glacier Peak country . But now pack trips are secondary . Drive northeast on U. S. 10 or Washington 7 . Transmission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumbledown farmhouses . At Ephrata men with maps , transits , and cameras come and go in innumerable station wagons . Up through an immense declivity , 1,000 feet deep and 51 miles long , the road leads . The ground drops away at the head of this rocky trough and far below the Columbia River surges through a granite chasm . A dam spans the river here that dwarfs every other dam ever built . Almost a mile across and 550 feet high , it is three times the bulk of Boulder Dam for example . This fabulous edifice is Grand Coulee . Although stuck off in the hinterland where the pavement ends , it is the principal single tourist attraction in a region full of many attractions . It may be more of an attraction by spring when , with the melting snows , over the spillway will thunder a cataract wider than the American Falls at Niagara , twice as high , and pouring a greater volume of water . Often it is no kindness to recommend the trite and obvious , but at Grand Coulee the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dam pushes enough power for a thousand factories . Soon water will follow , to reclaim the 1,200,000 acres of sagebrush where now the crumbling farmhouses shudder in the wind . Here is repeated the old dream of a new Canaan , a place to go and settle . Three hundred and fifty thousand Americans will find fertile farms when Coulee 's monstrous Pumps go to work . Allocate at least an entire day to Grand Coulee . Buses connect with the railroads at both Spokane and Wenatchee . If you stay overnight pick the Mason City Hotel , which has plywood walls but soft , clean beds . Major S. E. Hutton of the Bureau of Reclamation will prove your best guide . Goateed and philosophical , lie has seen 1,650,000 people ? from Mr. Roosevelt to carloads of Okies in search of land to till ? drive that way since the first granite core was drilled in 1933 . Then only Sam Seaton , who ran a sheep ferry , and Charlie Osborne , a rancher , lived in the vicinity . Now you can buy gas at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airy , white high school . As you leave Grand Coulee late in the afternoon , with dusk beginning to shroud the crags , peer back down once again at the unbelievable dam with its twenty-storey powerhouse , and it will look in the dull light like some crouching engine of to-morrow , ready for the next chapter in the Northwest . VI So there it is ? the Columbia River Basin ; four States with 13 per cent of the country 's land and only 3 per cent of the people . It is old yet new , the last part of the nation to be explored but inhabited by whites for nearly a century and a half , nevertheless . It is predominantly outdoors , although the cities can keep a traveler occupied for as long as he desires . It offers wild and untamed fastnesses , and also Sir Thomas Beecham leading a brilliant symphony orchestra , as well as moving and realistic paintings of all these scenes by Kenneth Callahan , the young director of the Seattle Art Museum . It is a region of mild climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months for the visitor . Snow seldom falls in Portland or Seattle , although in the mountains forty miles away it frequently stacks up to the treetops . The Davenport Hotel in Spokane is as good a place as any to sum up your journey and prepare to depart . Spokane is a third the size of Seattle and approximately half that of Portland , but the builders of the Davenport evidently knew it would be the trading center of the Inland Empire and that the greatest water-power site in the United States was a mere 88 miles distant . Many tired pilgrims with Coulee dust on their hides have eaten roast beef dinner at the Davenport , tucked under their arms the local Spokesman-Review , the Portland Oregonian , or the Seattle Past-Intelligencer , the region 's leading papers , and gone upstairs and slept the clock round in the Davenport 's wide beds . You can go east from Spokane through the Coeur d'Alene and back across Montana into the sunrise ; you can drive north toward Revelstoke and Lake Louise in Canada , or you can swing down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads stretch out to all these points . By whatever route you depart you can always get a final , beckoning glimpse of the timbered wilderness with its crown of eternal snowcaps.
