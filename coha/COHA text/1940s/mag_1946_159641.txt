Most race track barns are tinder dry . The one housing Elizabeth Arden Graham 's horses at Arlington Park , near Chicago , was no exception . Flames , from a fire caused by an unwatched electric heater , licked over the loose straw bedding and lapped at wooden partitions . A Negro groom threw a single bucket of water , saw that it was futile and made a beeline to save the horses . <P> First out of the inferno was squealing , kicking Beaugay , the fleetest two-year-old filly of the 1945 season . Somebody held her fast . Stable boys led out other terrified thoroughbreds ; agonized screams came from horses still in the blaze . In 20 minutes , the worst fire in horse-racing history was over . The toll : 23 horses valued at about $400,000 . Only six were saved . <P> The heavy toll was largely caused by the horse 's civilized stupidity . Five of the Arden racers which had been led to safety broke loose , ran back into the blazing barn and perished . After generations of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their stalls are the best and safest place in an emergency . They do n't know what fire is and have little or no wild instinct left to warn them against it. * <P> <P> * " You never see a deer get burned in a forest fire , " commented Frank ( Bring ' Em Back Alive ) Buck , who thinks the horse is pretty dumb anyhow . He rates the intellectuals of animaldom as 1 ) elephants , 2 ) anthropoid apes , 3 ) dogs .
