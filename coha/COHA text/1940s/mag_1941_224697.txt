When World War II is finished two nations will hold in their hands the destiny of the western world : the U. S. and the winner . If Germany wins , the U. S. must come to terms or to blows with a German-dominated New Order . If Great Britain wins with U. S. aid , the U. S. will have the right and the duty to participate in an Anglo-Saxon New Order . The outlines of Germany 's New Order are already clear : serfdom for everybody except the people who run Germany . Those of the Anglo-Saxon New Order are not clear . <P> Since the war began , many sections of the British press and public have tried to force their Government to state its aims for war and peace . Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain dodged the question ; Prime Minister Winston Churchill begged it again last week : " The first of our war aims is to be worthy of that love of the Dominions . " To many people it would seem silly for a man who is being choked to death to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survives . But an increasingly articulate body of opinion , both in Britain and the U. S. , holds that to fight a good war , or to help others fight it , people must know what kind of world they are fighting for . <P> U. S. pressure for a British statement of peace aims has come not only from isolationists ( who hope the statement will be unsatisfactory ) but from the Government itself , which wants to unite the public behind its policy of all-out aid to Britain . In Britain the case of the peace-aims advocates has been best stated by Author John Boynton Priestley , chairman of a Socialist-minded group which calls itself The 1941 Committee . Said he : <P> " What we want is a short , clear creed , acceptable to the decent common man everywhere , that will act like a trumpet call . Then we must proclaim it everywhere . ... If we fought with ideas as well as weapons , we should not only help to construct a world worth living in , but also shorten the war . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's friend and boarder , Harry L. Hopkins , left London for the U. S. after four weeks of the closest intellectual intimacy with British Government leaders . He had even attended meetings of the inner War Cabinet . It was certain that he would tell the President all he had learned about British peace aims . It was all but certain that Franklin Roosevelt would then tell the U. S. as much as he thought it ought to know . That would probably be enough to convince most of the U. S. that Britain was fighting for democracy . <P> In Washington last week the new British Ambassador , Lord Halifax , worked on a draft of his first speech in the U. S. , to be delivered at a Pilgrims dinner in New York Feb. 24 . Since this will be soon after Envoy Hopkins ' return , it seemed not unlikely that Lord Halifax would also have something to say about peace aims . Whoever said it first , the U. S. was soon to know a great deal more about what Britain is fighting for . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the U. S. 's , war and peace aims more and more earnestly in the months to come .
