When the Red Cross takes a pint of blood from a patriotic donor , the blood is centrifuged to separate the light-colored fluid ( plasma ) from the red blood corpuscles . The plasma-60% of the blood 's volume-may save a life in Africa ; the red residue goes down the sewer , because red blood corpuscles quickly spoil . New York 's Lederle Laboratories alone discard over 1,000 pints a day . <P> Dr. Warren Cooksey , technical supervisor of Detroit 's blood bank , thought the red blood cells should be saved if possible-they are the material needed in a large proportion of hospital transfusions ( e.g. , anemia ) , are ordinarily given to patients in whole blood purchased from professional donors at $25 a pint . Dr. Cooksey found that , mixed with a simple salt solution , red cells will keep in good condition for a little over a week , provided processing takes place within an hour of bloodletting . At his suggestion , the blood bank will soon send Detroit hospitals 800 pints of red blood cells a week . Cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitals can use only a small part of Detroit 's red-cell residue . Parke , Davis &; Co. , which does Detroit 's blood processing for the Red Cross , developed a way to use the remainder to make peptone-bacteria food ordinarily made from various animal proteins ( like hog 's stomach , etc . ) . This new human peptone feeds bacteria cultures grown to make tetanus toxoid , typhoid vaccines and other shots for the armed forces .
