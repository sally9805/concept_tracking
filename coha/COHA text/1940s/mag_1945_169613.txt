Uncle Harry ( Universal ) is a thriller , produced by Alfred Hitchcock 's onetime secretary , Joan Harrison , whose murder thriller Phantom Lady ( TIME , Feb. 24 , 1944 ) established her as one of Hollywood 's talented producers . Her second offering , a Broadway play adaptation , is again directed by able Robert Siodmak , and again features a vivid performance by Ella Raines . Uncle Harry is better done than its predecessor , more human , subtler , more exciting . <P> Harry ( George Sanders ) is the kind of man everybody likes and nobody quite respects-a man rendered permanently infantile by his own gentleness , by his family 's standing in their small New England town , and above all by his bickering , manless sisters , the widow Hester ( Moyna Macgill ) and the semi-invalid Lettie ( Geraldine Fitzgerald ) . Lettie in particular takes care that life shall never disturb him with a breath of fresh air . <P> When a strong cool blast of it ( Ella Raines ) wakes him up and threatens to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sister Lettie 's feelings about him exceed the sisterly . From there on the story is ever-crueler melodrama , culminating in a tacked-on ending which the audience is requested not to tell-presumably on the assumption that everybody has the right to feel sold out . <P> Despite its silly ending , Uncle Harry is worth seeing . Its hints of psychological incest , which are so arranged that you can take them or leave them , are even more interesting in their Hays Office aspects than as drama . The acutely recorded small-town characters and atmospheres , and the intense performances of all four principal players , are something more . Especially notable is Geraldine Fitzgerald 's portrayal of the harboring sister-the first role in years which has given this actress opportunity to show more than a fraction of her worth . <P> Victim 's Explanation . Watching her play minor roles in major films like Wilson , major roles in minor films like Shining Victory , discerning cinemaddicts have long been puzzled by Geraldine Fitzgerald 's fourth-magnitude stardom . <P> Because this particular victim of Holly wood 's wonderful ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 3 ) now free to talk - her long-term contract with Warner has just expired ( " thank God " ) - Miss Fitzgerald has finally explained all . Any Hollywoodenhead would insist that it was entirely her own fault , and , in a measure , she would cheerfully agree . <P> The trouble started in the rush of her first success when Dark Victory and Wuthering Heights made it clear that she would soon become a major star . David Selznick wanted her for the title role in Hitchcock 's smash Rebecca , but she turned it down . She was under contract to Warner for half of each year ; if she worked for Selznick , he would own the other half . She preferred to spend it with her husband , in Ireland . That sort of independence is neither admired nor understood in Hollywood . It did n't exactly enhance her stock , either , when she returned from Ireland pregnant . <P> She began getting second-grade , left over and plain trash roles . She was done out of a long-promised chance to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoroughly in a play by Irwin Shaw ( Sons and Soldiers ) . The fact that it flopped sent her Hollywood stock still lower .
