Last week in Marseille , the Communist-dominated World-Federation of Trade Unions created an International Union of Seamen and Dockers , with Harry Bridges as its president . Bridges could not accept the new post in person . He is under indictment for perjury in San Francisco ( TIME June 6 ) , and the judge thought it unwise to let him leave the country . <P> When the W.F.T.U. was founded at Paris in 1945 , the C.I.O. , with which Bridges ' militant International Longshoremen 's and Warehousemen 's Union is still affiliated , was a member . The A.F.L. was not . Last January the C.I.O. , fed up with fighting the Communist line in the W.F.T.U. , quit it cold . Representatives of 36 nations met last month in Geneva to set up an anti-Communist international labor organization . The C.I.O. attended-and so did the A.F.L. The new organization will speak for some 42 million anti-Communist trade union members . It will not speak for Harry Bridges .                  @ @ @
