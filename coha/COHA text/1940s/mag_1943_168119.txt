The 81st session of the Japanese Diet closed last week after vesting more military , political and economic powers in Premier Hideki Tojo than any premier has held since Japan emerged from feudalism in 1868 . <P> From the assortment of titles he now holds , Tojo ( " the Razor " ) could easily be mistaken for Tojo , the Dictator : he is Premier , War Minister , Home Minister , production chief . Tojo himself halfheartedly dispelled this interpretation when he explained : " I am not speaking of absolute dictatorship but I would like to make this clear : I possess power as Premier by order of the Emperor , and at present I am the leader of the nation . The responsibility is an important one in every way in the glorious light of the foundation of the empire . " Another explanation : Tojo exercised his powers on behalf of the Japanese military , particularly the potent Kwantung Army clique which originally put him in office . <P> Bowing to Tojo and his Army &; Navy colleagues , who are now unassailably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills which strengthened the military strangle hold : <P> &gt; A special ordinance gave Tojo the authority to take over the duties of any Cabinet Minister dealing with questions of " labor , materials , motive power and capital . " Tojo appointed three new administrative and economic boards , saved the face of formerly powerful Japanese industrialists by making them advisers . <P> &gt; A wartime criminal law gave the Imperial Rule Assistance Assn . ( Japan 's two-year-old totalitarian party ) apparently unlimited powers to suppress criticism of the Government . <P> &gt; Another law took away the right of local residents to elect their own officials . These officials hereafter will be selected by prefectural governors . <P> &gt; A bill " relative to conscription in Manchuria " indicated that Japan , for the first time , is preparing to draft Chinese into Japanese armed forces or into labor battalions , or both . This measure may well have been a part of Japan 's effort to convince the Chinese that they will have a coequal place in the Greater Asia ( see p. 20 ) . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "
