txt Angry members of the House Committee on Un-American Activities said today that they were not even consulted about a textbook checkup that has involved the group in its hottest controversy of the year . Probably the most irate was Representative John , Democrat , of Ohio . One of the institutions asked for a list of books was his alma mater , Wooster College , in his home town of Wooster , Ohio . The request to Wooster and to about seventy other colleges and universities , in addition to boards of education in all states , was intended to give the committee a start on finding out whether Communist propaganda had gotten into schoolbooks . Five of the nine committee members said that they were not told about the request in advance . Members said that Mr. 's reaction was so " violent " that it was mainly responsible for a follow-up letter sent out today assuring educators formally that " the committee does not desire to interfere in any manner with academic freedom , nor does it intend to censor textbooks . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took responsibility for the original letter He told reporters there was " no formal decision " on it by the committee , but " it never occurred to me anyone would object . " He said that the members discussed the subject and suggestions were made that " we get what information we could on it . " A large percentage of the institutions are being " very cooperative , " said Mr. Wood , who indicated that there was no intention of calling off the survey . He added that " I ca n't for the life of me see how anyone objects/to it . " Mr. said that despite today 's letter " the damage is already done . " Representative Harold H. Velde , Republican , of Illinois , said that the original letter was a " serious mistake and has reflected on the committee that has tried to keep things on a high standard . " A member who did not want his name used said : " It 's just a case of somebody getting a bit trigger-happy . The staff received a petition and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is unfortunate that the thing happened at all . " The petition was sent in by the National Sons of the American Revolution . The committee said in its afterthought letter that the peItition contained " serious allegations " about textbooks , so it picked the colleges and schools entirely at random and asked for the following things : " A list of textbooks and supplementary reading , together with ' authors , which are being used by your institution in the fields of sociology , geography , economics , government , philosophy , history , political science and American literature . " There were immediate protests from eductional organizations and prominent educators . Some accused the committe of attacking academic freedom . Both the original and follow-up letters were signed by Mr. Wood . Representative Morgan M. Moulder , Democrat , of Missouri , said that Mr. Wood did mention the Sons of the American Revolution petition to the committee , but that it took no action and made no decision to do anything about it . Deny Knowing of Letters Mr. Moulder expressed belief that a check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one , except Mr. Wood , knew ahead of time the letter was going out . Representatives Velde , , Francis E. Walter , Democrat , of Pennsylvania , and Richard M. Nixon , Republican , of California , said that they did not know about it . Mr. was graduated from Wooster College in 1912 . He has taught there at summer sessions and has been on the board of trustees . To make things worse , he said : " I was out at my college during commencement week when this letter arrived . The effect was terrible . Everyone was asking for an explanation , and I : could n't give one . : I didn't4know anything about it . " There were parents at the commencement exercises who , are wondering now whether they should send their children there . There is no basis for their suspicions , but no amount of explanation can undo the damage completely . " One of the reasons for reorganizing the- committee at the start of the present Congress , he asserted , was to prevent the smearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " it did not occur to us at the time that an innocent college could be smeared also . But we are certainly going to have to take steps to see that it does n't happen again . " The letter today assured edu cators that the earlier request for textbook lists " should not be construed as having the slightest unfavorable reflection or criticism on your school or any person connected therewith . " It said that if the request involved too much work the committee would be willing to pass up supplemental material and get along with just " the title and author of the principal textbooks now in use " in the fields the committee mentioned . The letter , taking note of complaints that the committee objects to the teaching of the principles of Karl Marx and other founders of communism , said : " It is of - no concern to-the committee if the , Communist Manifesto or . any other book- or document containing the tenets of commitnism is being studied for comparative purposes in our educational institutions . " ? The committee said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at face value and was trying to determine the amount of work involved in proving or disproving its allegations . It added that the committee had " no preconception of what might be found , if anything at all . "
