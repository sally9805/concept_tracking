txt Governor Dewey 's Executive Budget , which will be submitted to the Legislature this week , will recommend an increase of $60,000,000 , or almost 20 per cent , in State aid to local governmental units , it was reported reliably tonight . Such a rise would push the total appropriations for local assistance above $365,000,000 , a new all-time high . It can also be counted upon to bolster legislative resistance to further increases such as are being demanded by teacher groups and Mayor O 'D  --  vyer 's administration in New York City . A substantial increase in appropriations recommended for State purposes , other than local assistance and new capital projects to be financed out of the post-war reconstruction fund is also in prospect . Mr. Dewey indicated in his annual message to the Legislature earlier this month that the over-all total would be between $640,000,000 and $650 ; 000,000 . The proposed jump in local assistance appropriations , officials say , is due primarily to mounting costs of the social welfare and expanded public-health programs and does not contemplate any revision of existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been demanded by teachers , or aid to municipalities as Mayor O'Dwyer is requesting . School Formula May Stand State aid to education will be increased by $3,000,000 to $4,000 , - 000 in the new budget under operation of the existing formula because of higher average daily attendance . The budget is reported to assume that the formula , despite attacks being made upon it by teacher and parent groups , will remain unchanged . Of the $60,000,000 increase in local assistance for which provision is made , a substantial part , perhaps more than half , will go to New York City . But it is unlikely to ease Mayor O'Dwyer 's financial problems to any great extent since it is earmarked for relief or health purposes . The budget is said to be drafted on the assumption that the Moore plan , which fixes State aid for general city purposes at $6.75 per capita on the basis of the 1940 Federal census , will also be left unchanged . Lazarus Joseph , the New York City Controller , has been urging that the per capita payment be increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed budget , efforts of Mayor O'Dwyer and teacher groups to get increases in State aid are likely to run into substantial taxpayer opposition when the Governor 's recommendations are considered by legislative fiscal committees . Warning Given by Group Indicative of the attitude taxpayers will take was the warning issued today by the Citizens Public Expenditure Survey that the State would be faced with the necessity of imposing new and increased taxes unless it called a halt to ever-increasing spending . Submission of the budget to the Legislature late this week is expected to intensify the efforts of both the New York City administration and the teachers to - gel further consideration for their requests . Their drives probably will reach a climax at public hearings on the budget before fiscal committees of the Senate and Assembly .
