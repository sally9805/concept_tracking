Across the triumphal homecoming of the Commander in Chief of Brazil 's victorious Expeditionary Force fell the shadow of Brazil 's worst naval disaster . <P> It was the Fourth of July . The ancient cruiser Baa was patrolling the South Atlantic along the route that Allied planes fly from Natal to Dakar . With four U.S. Navy technicians aboard , some of the Brazilian sailors were celebrating Independence Day . A stunning explosion rocked the Baa . Subsequent blasts literally blew her apart . Blue-bloused sailors were tossed into the waves . Commander Davila Garcia Albuquerque , his arm shattered by the explosion , shouted to his crew , " Save yourselves ; I 'm finished . " But few of them were able to . Three minutes after the first explosion the Baa sank . <P> Four days later , the British freighter S.S. Balfe came upon six of the Baa 's life rafts , pulled aboard the 22 miserable survivors who gave the world its first hint of the disaster . Later , other rescue vessels picked up a few more of the Baa 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Recife before a crowd of solemn men and weeping women . Only a handful were saved . The survivors believed that the Baa had struck a floating mine , exploded the magazine .
