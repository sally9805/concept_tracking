News smuggled out of Copenhagen last week gave another lie to Nazi propaganda . Nazi Enlightener &; Propagandist Paul Joseph Goebbels has declared that Denmark is not even an occupied country , that it is a fine example of how a nation can live contented and prosperous under Nazi protection . Some facts : <P> &gt; Since the Russo-German campaign the Enlightener &; Propagandist has manipulated a furious anti-Communist campaign in Denmark to force the Government to break diplomatic relations with Moscow . A Nazi-organized Danish Free Corps to fight Russia drew only 150 volunteers , but this was considered sufficient for enlightenment &; propaganda . Hundreds of Danish Communists have been jailed , including Novelist Martin Andersen-Nexoe . <P> &gt; The press was dutch-rubbed into printing a statement emphasizing Denmark 's " unneutral " attitude toward the U.S.S.R. But Danes no longer believe their papers and on dark streets even the newsboys call : " Eight re* worth of lies , four re worth of ads ! " <P> &gt; Economically the Nazis are plundering the country by making the Danes pay 450,000,000 kroner for Reich " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finance German imports with unlimited credit . Denmark , which always had an export balance , now owes Germany 1,500,000,000 kroner , and inflation is taking hold . <P> &gt; Unemployment is now around a quartermillion . Every second worker who has unemployment insurance is jobless . <P> &gt; There is an acute food , feed and fuel shortage . Due to the slaughter of poultry , egg production this winter will be only one-third of last winter 's . Wrote a farmer : " On many farms cows are too weak to rise and have to be lifted up .

The Germans encourage this splintering to forward the disintegration of the country 's political system . They hope to absorb Denmark whole . <P> &gt; Only the urgent pleas of King Christian X , whom everybody loves , have hitherto prevented full-blast sabotage . The cowed Government of huge , old , Moses-bearded Premier Thorvald Stauning , who has been in office for twelve years , has sunk low in popular esteem . <P> &gt; To express approbation for their Minister to the U.S. Henrik de Kauffmann , who put Greenland in U.S. keeping , many Danes recently took to wearing little Statue-of-Liberty insignia on their lapels .
