<P> Sir : <P> With reference to the article " AntiSemitic Twist ? " TIME , Oct. 4 , am I to believe that minority groups are now attempting to censor and to prohibit the presentation of certain cinema classics , particularly English classics ? . . . <P> Some individuals could go so far as to accuse a jealous Hollywood . This , too , is food for thought , because J. Arthur Rank has produced some truly great cinemas which to date have not been equaled by Hollywood . <P> It is my honest opinion that the Toronto Jewish Congress handled this " ersatz " problem in a most dignified and rational manner . All persons involved should be congratulated . <P> I trust that we in the U.S. shall soon be able to see Oliver Twist at our local movie theaters . <P> <P> DAVID A. SHERWOOD Washington , D.C. <P> <P> Sir : <P> ... If Oliver Twist is done half as well as was Great Expectations , I want to see it ... <P> If it is antiSemitic , then by similar reasoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is anti-Negro . <P> <P> ROBERT E. CHANDLER New London , Conn . <P> <P> Sir : <P> ... I should have liked to see Oliver Twist ; and I bitterly resent it that pressure groups should have successfully committed a breach of the democratic process in depriving me and many millions of others of our right to see that film . . . <P> <P> ALAN MARSHALL Cohasset , Mass . <P> <P> Smokestacks on the Sierra <P> Sir : <P> Enjoyed TIME 'S Sept. 27 coverage of Earl Warren 's special train . . . Reference to the ' ' engine backing slowly , " however , may prompt some of the West 's railfan enthusiasts to write you , * since the train was powered over the Sierra not by a backward-operating locomotive but by one of this company 's powerful cab-ahead-type locomotives . <P> These 125-foot , 6,000-horsepower , 4-8-8-2 wheel arrangement , single expansion articulated engines , distinctive of this railroad , have an enclosed cab that puts enginemen right up front so they can see more easily what 's around a curve . Smokestack at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation to one not familiar with this type locomotive . . . <P> <P> K. C. INGRAM <P> Southern Pacific Co . San Francisco , Calif . <P> <P> Ketchup on the House <P> Sir : <P> As I read your account of Charles W. Morton 's attack on the fraternity system at Williams College TIME , Sept. 27-and inferentially against the system in general-my immediate reaction was to diagnose his ... rehash of ancient and outmoded arguments against fraternities as a consequence of a recent attack of ulcers , a psychoneurotic ailment that brought to consciousness a childhood disappointment . . . <P> Perhaps the most helpful nonadministrative group connected with the educative process on the college campus today are the fraternities . By fostering school spirit , extracurricular activities and social functions , they help develop latent qualities of leadership and help broaden students ' personalities . . . <P> <P> EDWARD DECROSTA <P> Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Troy , N.Y . <P> <P> Sir : <P> Since Charles Morton depends on his stomach for his judgment , then it is through the stomach that we would like to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
