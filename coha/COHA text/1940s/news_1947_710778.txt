txt Brig . Gen. William L. Richardson , Chief of Guided Missiles of the Air Force ; predicted today that the United States would " produce the prototype of a guided missile with a 200-mile range within a few years and prototypes with lesser ranges in about a year . General Richardson said he was not sure whether the Army , the Air Force or the Navy would be first in producing one or more of the prototypes of the several types under study : . Research and development , he explained , were moving forward so rapidly that forecasts more than six months in advance were futile . All three of the armed forces were cooperating closely , General Richardson said . Each was making an approach to guided-missile development brsed on its own needs , but anyone of them was likely to turn up with a weapon which all three would use , he added . In speaking of prototypes of new weapons , General Richardson made it clear that he meant missiles which would be distinct improvements over the German V-2 , now unde intensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J13-2 , which is the Air Force version of the German V-1 , and of controlled bombs . He referred to these three ' weapons as useful in research leading to the weapons to come . An interview with General Richardson was prompted by a remark yesterday by Gen. Carl Spaatz , Chief of Staff of the Air Force , at a press conference at which the reorganization of the Air Force was explained . In the new reorganization chart the Guided Missiles Branch was shown as a prominent appendage of the Operations Division and General Spaatz was asked to explain the significance of this . General Spaatz replied that developments of guided missiles had gone far enough to warrant " thinking " about tactical doctrine for their use . General Richardson disclosed today that considerable material had been put in writing on tactics and techniques , personnel , training , logistics and types of organization necessary for guidedmissile warfare . Material Tested in Field This doctrinal and technical material , all classified for security , is being applied practically in the field in the use of present available and experimental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The unit pioneering guided-missile warfare and the tentative doctrine is the First Experimental Guided Missile Group at Eglin Field , Fla. , an outfit of 130 officers and about 700 enlisted men . Reports of its operations already bulk several inches thick at Air Force Headquarters . It was formed Feb. 7 , 1946 . General Richardson 's views were in marked contrast with those of some other officials who have talked recently of guided missiles which would flash across the oceans , to the moon , or become satellites of the earth in a pushbutton war . He said the Air Force would consider guided missiles in the " available " class only when they proved superior and could supplant such conventional weapons as .50 caliber machine guns , artillery and bombers . He foresaw an interim era when guided missiles would merely supplement the present weapons of the armed forces . General Richardson began to learn about guided missiles when he was on the receiving end of German ** The Ninth Air Defense Command , which he organized in December , 1943 , ultimately shot down 2,000 ** @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invasion ports of Europe . Drones Held Useful The general placed only drones , planes packed with explosives and guided by mother ships , in the present " available " class of worthwhile weapons . These were used in combat in the recent war . He said research and development was proceeding on the following types , and cautioned tat it might be many years before the development of all types could be considered complete : Surface-to-surface missile : Two types . The first is a winged missile and includes the V-1 and drones , which has aerodynamic surfaces , and sustains itself , like an airplane . The other is the rocket type which flies on a parabolic course . The 200-mile weapon would fall in this category and would have to be brought to a point of accuracy and efficiency enabling the saturation of distant cities and other targets , General Richardson said . Surface-to-air  --  Basically one type , the jet propulsion rocket . Air-to-air  --  One basic type , powered to fly horizontally , launched by aircraft against other aircraft . Ar-to-surf ace  --  Primarily one type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guided to its target by the launching aircraft .
