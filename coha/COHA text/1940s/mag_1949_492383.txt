MEWHERE in the United States right at this minute several persons are exercising their in- alienable right to sit down and knock off a letter to the President . One of them may be an indignant housewife complaining about high prices at the butcher shop . Another may be a big Businessman expressing his views on taxation . Still another may be suggesting that the President try Aunt Martha 's home remedy for his cold . Several thousand persons write to the Chief Executive every day on every subject you can think of , and a great many that you could never even imagine . Some are serious thinkers , some are busybodies and some are just crazy , like the man who asked for " a list of all the misses in the U. S. , so I can solve the mystery of who is Miss Hush on the radio . " Most of them expect the President to read and answer their letters or perform some small favor such as putting them in touch with a soldier in Munich , selling a piece of fancy embroidery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropping an atom bomb on some foreign capital . Some of them suspect that their letters might not reach the President and include a bitter denunciation of nosy secretaries and clerks who ought to be put in jail if they open letters addressed to someone else . Well , what does happen to your letter after you address it to the President at the White House and drop it into the mailbox ? Back in the McKinley Administration , when I first started handling the White House mail , the answer would have been pretty simple . The postman would bring around a bag of mail , maybe 100 letters , and I would open them and turn them over to the President 's secretary or send them to one of the departments or to a stenographer for answer . Some of them I answered myself . Today the principle is the same , but what a difference in operations ! Before I retired as Chief of Mails at the White House in June of 1948 , I headed a unit that had ten readers , twelve postal clerks , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the job I had once handled alone . And in rush times we had as many as seventy persons working to keep up with perhaps 150,000 letters , cards and packages a day . Mail arrives at the White House receiving room in a special sealed truck driven by a post-office employee who does nothing but . deliver mailbags to the President . Your letter is buried somewhere in the pile of bags , but do n't worry . It wo n't be lost . A corps of clerks permanently detailed by the city post office to the White House takes over in the receiving room . They put the letters , which are tied in bundles , under a fluoroscope  --  a boxlike metal contraption about three feet by two and three feet high  --  and look at them through a glass window . If there is a dime or a paper clip or any other such object in your letter , they will see it even if it is in the middle of the bundle . They wo n't worry if they see either a dime or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puz zling or suspicious , the bundle is broken open and that letter is removed before the others are turned over to clerks in the sorting room . There are six sorting boxes where the mail is distributed to pigeonholes marked for the President , his wife and various staff members . When a pigeonhole is full , the clerk at that position takes the letters out and stacks them up edgewise along his table . There is a ruler on the edge of the table , and he notes down how many inches of mail he has sorted for the President . Nobody counts letters to the President these days . They are measured by the foot . or yard , which gives the same result and saves time . The mail for the President 's wife goes to her secretaries , but the President 's mail is stacked in piles on a long table . The Chief of Mails at the White House and his assistant go through these stacks to pick out the personal mail for the Chief Executive . You need a good memory for stationery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you also have to be something of a handwriting expert to pick out the letters which go to the Presiden ' unopened . None of the nine Presidents under whom I served ever put a " hands-off " sign on any correspondence addressed to him except from members of his family or very close friends . After years of experience , it was not difficult for me to carry in my mind the color of stationery , the writing , the postmark and other peculiarities that enabled me to pick out this personal mail . Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt gave me the most trouble . When she was on a trip she seldom stuck to the advance itinerary which we checked on regularly . Not only was it almost impossible to forward mail to her but she wrote to the President from so many unexpected towns and on such odd hotel stationery that it was only with great difficulty that I could recognize her letters without opening them . After sorting out the personal and " important " mail , the rest of the correspondence addressed to the President  --  probably including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gathered in piles and distributed to the readers , starting at about 8:15 A.M. A good reader may get through 500 or 600 letters a day , particularly if that includes a good many organized-pressure letters , which can be handled quickly . The reader sees plenty of strange addresses on the letters that come to the White House , including those that show the surprising ignorance ? and sometimes the political sentiments  --  of the writers . For instance : " To His Majesty of the U. S. A. , Comrade and Buddy " ; " Mr. Roslyvelt " ; " Frank Land Rooset " ; " Pft-Phooy-Pres . Roosevelt " ; " R. O. SevIt . " ; " Frank De Law Roosvelt " ; " The Great Promiser " ; " Rusenvelt " ; or merely " Too deer President . " Such letters are likely to be on the peculiar side , because countless persons seem to think that the President will accept money to grant . them a divorce , or take payments on ( Con t raised on Pore 82 ) THE SATURDAY ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new currency in exchange for the ashes of bills that were accidentally burned . One woman seeking to establish that she deserved a pension sent in a handful of the ashes of her late husband . The clerk who opened the letter , unfortunately , stepped in front of an electric fan and the " evidence " vanished in a second . All such letters are acknowledged , but presuming your letter is a sensible one , it would get special attention , depending on the subject matter . The reader must have a thorough knowledge of all the Government departments and agencies and their duties , so he can quickly write on your letter the name or initials of the agency that will handle it . Sounds simple , but it means knowing the names and duties of such agencies as FERA , HOLC , IEFC , CAA , ODT , NRA , WAA and ACPSAHMWA . You try to figure them out , and then remember that during the New Deal alphabetic-agency period there were scores of them , and many were changing every other week . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Protection and Salvage of Artistic and Historic Monuments in War Areas . If your letter is to be handled or acknowledged by the White House staff , it is sent to the proper secretary or to the chief stenographer , perhaps after a memorandum has been filed regarding its contents . So you can see that when you sit down to write to the President the chances of the President 's seeing your letter are about the same as those of a long shot in the daily double at Hialeah . But the letters are just part of it . PeoRle also send packages to the President , and they are even more work . A lot of strange things came out of packages sent to the White House in the last fifty years ; everything from gold teeth sent in by persons who heard it was illegal to hoard gold to a gold-plated toilet seat sent to Mr. Truman . When gold currency and coins were withdrawn from circulation , we received some $468,000 worth of gold articles from persons who misunderstood the Treasury order and believed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government . Later , during the war , many persons sent in contributions of money or gold articles to be sold for defense , ranging from one dollar to buy bullets for use on the Japs , to checks for $50,000 contributed by workers in a factory . All such contributions were sent to the Treasury . All packages get about the same treatment to start with . They go unEVENING POST der the fluoroscope and often under the X ray . Men well trained in bomb detection handle them until they are okayed as harmless . Then they are checked against a " look out " file which contains all letters received previously saying to look out for a package mailed to the President . Such gifts present many difficult problems . All of them are acknowledged , but few of them are anything that the Chief Executive would want or could use . Or , if the gift is expensive , it may be refused because the President would find it unwise to accept anything that might put him under an obligation to the sender . All others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter how useless or horrible they may be . That rule was made after Margaret Le Hand , the personal secretary to F.D.R. , received a package containing a statuette sent to the President . She found it so repulsive that she immediately shattered it . The January 29,1949 sculptor later wrote in about it , and we were involved in a six months ' correspondence trying to explain why we could n't either return it or pay him $200 for it . He finally got tired of asking . The large number of gifts sent to F.D.R. resulted in building . a basement storeroom to hold the overflow of presents  --  some valuable and some merely horrible pieces of junk . This room was unofficially called " the Chamber of Horrors " because , as one newspaper reporter said , of the " grotesqueness of many of the good-will gifts " received by the Roosevelts . The reporter added that the President never used the term , but he had long since become aware of what was meant when he turned a gift over to a subordinate and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in the Chamber of Horrors for safekeeping , sir .

Each President is able to exercise considerable discretion regarding gifts , and there has been a good deal of variation . President McKinley was careful about accepting anything more than a crate of oranges or a box of cigars . Theodore Roosevelt received many odd gifts , especially canes in the shape of the " big stick " that he made famous , and his daughter , Alice , received a trainload of gifts when she was married . The Tafts accepted hundreds of silver gifts on their twenty-fifth wedding anniversary . Woodrow Wilson and Herbert Hoover were not interested , and did not want even the most inexpensive gifts , but . Calvin Coolidge kept a close record of all presents , and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White House . F.D.R. received a tremendous assortment of gifts , with canes  --  because he was crippled  --  probably the leading item . He took an interest , in odd gifts , little carvings , ship models and trinkets , and littered the place with those that happened to strike his fancy . Gifts coming in through the customs always cause a lot of trouble , but . I believe it was most acute during the time of F.D.R. A typical example was a man in Panama who wrote to the President expressing his admiration , and saying that he had made a special deep-sea fishing rod and an exquisite reel which he was sending as a gift . Miss Le Hand replied , telling him that Mr. Roosevelt was very appreciative and was looking forward to using the equipment . A couple of weeks later the Collector of Customs notified me that he had a rod and reel for the President . They had been appraised , he said , and the duty of approximately 50 per cent came to the neat sum of $480 . Would the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he would send over the fishing equipment , which was handsome indeed . No cash , no rod or reel . I told Miss Le Hand , and her mouth popped open . " Oh , my ! " she said . " I thought Panama was part of the United States . I did n't know there 'd be any duty . " Neither one of us had any intention of asking the President to fork over the money , since he already had a truckload of fishing equipment . Miss Le Hand got together with the State Department experts on what to do , and finally cooked up a letter to the kindhearted Panamanian . The President , she said , was not permitted to accept such valuable gifts , and therefore the State Department was forced to return the rod and reel . But , she added , Mr. Roosevelt was planning to make a voyage that would take him to Panama , and he hoped that the man would come aboard his ship and demonstrate the qualities of the equipment . He did make such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he did n't show up . After that , all letters regarding gifts from foreign countries were routed to me , and we investigated the question of duty and , when necessary , had the State Department send the gifts back with a diplomatic letter of explanation . President Truman received notice from the Customs office at one time that a gift valued at $1000 had arrived for him . We checked up and found that it was a portrait of Mr. Truman which had been painted by the Mexican who sent it . It was either an esoteric masterpiece that I was unable to appreciate or it was a rotten painting , and we so advised the President . He expressed a complete lack of interest , and the State Department advised the sender that it was being returned because it was not proper for the President to accept such valuable gifts . They got a telegram back promptly , saying not to send it back , but please to sell it to somebody . Mr. Truman always got a kick out of seeing presents or cards from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were instructed to send all the greeting cards to him . He evidently enjoyed seeing them , but we puzzled for weeks trying to acknowledge many of them with no other clue than a scrawled signature suc  --  as " Harry " or " Your pal Hank " or " Old Pete . " Once when the President made an offhand remark at a press conference about his own difficulties in getting white shirts during the war , he was inundated with a flood of white shirts in the next mail . Later , without saying anything , he received a lot of livestock from farmers who wanted to protest against the cost and scarcity of feed . An Iowa farmer sent him a live hog that weighed 700 pounds . The sixty-nine-dollar express charges were prepaid , and the animal was accompanied by a respectful letter saying the farmer rou/d n't sell the hog at a profit under current conditions ? May , 1948 ? and I was giving it to Mr. Truman . The President had no place for a live hog , but the Bureau of Animal Industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I told him the hog could be picked up at the express office . " Mr. Smith , " he said , " I had visions of us chasing that hog all over the White House lawn . " During the Truman drive to save grain for Europe , a number of chicken farmers sent . crates of live chickens to the White House as protest against chickenless Thursdays . The letters accompanying them insisted with tongue in cheek that they were merely gifts to the President , but the real purpose was obvious . We finally had to get the express company to head them off at the express depot and deliver them to the Walter Reed Hospital . The majority of gifts to the President are food of one kind or another . If a package of food was expected or came from someone well known  --  as when J. P. Morgan sometimes sent ducks to the White House  --  then we would inspect the package to see that there was no tampering , and send it over to the kitchen . But otherwise we would send it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tested chemically or on guinea pigs and monkeys : . Most food was thrown away , especially before the New Deal days , because there was no system then for test - ing it , and much of it arrived in poor condition . The end of prohibition brought one wave of gifts that . I well remember . All the manufacturers were eager to get their products publicized , and we were buried under five-gallon cans of pretzels and bottles of legal beer . Three times a day the express trucks would bring a new load , and I was soon giving pretzels to anybody who would take them . The beer , for the most part , went over to the White House , but Mr. Roosevelt merely admired the freak bottles  --  some of them holding ten gallons  --  and declined to drink any . He had been drinking a home brew that was stirred up by one of the stewards , and he kept right on drinking it after repeal . Said he liked it better . The Presidents , with the possible exception of Mr. Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trend of the mail in so far as it indicates the swing of public opinion . In the early part of the century , when perhaps 100 letters a day were received , people were not very well informed on the big issues before Congress . The newspapers carried less Washington news , there was no radio to spread word of what was happening in Congress , and only the most important problems were debated generally . During the Taft and Wilson administrations there was a steady growth in pressure mail , dealing with prohibition and the events leading up to the first World War . Organized labor , too , began bombarding the White House with letters , and in recent years labor probably has contributed more mail of t his character than any other bloc . In June of 1947 , the organized communications on the Taft-Hartley Bill set a record , averaging about 18,000 a day . On June twelfth , for instance , we received more than 13,190 letters , 47,300 post cards and 905 other items in the mail . This included 40,900 post cards demanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was particularly heavy as far as pressure mail in general was concerned . A few statistics indicate what we had to deal with . On the seventeenth we received 3800 post cards on the Palestine question , 400 on lynchings , 4500 on Public Law No. 27 , barring foreign-horn war-service seamen from American ships , and 10,900 calling upon the President to veto the Taft-Hartley Bill . AlmOst all these were printed or mimeographed form cards which were distributed by various organizations to individuals who signed and posted them . I have never felt that such inspired mail amounted to much , but the Presidents have usually taken a different viewpoint . Some of them have been inclined to think that . the dupes who write in on instructions represent the voice of the people , and all of I hem have wanted regular reports on such mail . In 1948 there were fifteen different subjects under which records of pressure mail were filed . These ranged from civil rights to prohibition , to war with Russia . Letters and post cards of this type usually arrive in large batches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who reads the newspapers carefully and is probably expecting them anyway . They are thrown aside until the other mail is handled . Eventually , each letter is opened and a regular report . is made on the number received and on the contents , in a general way . They are sent to whatever department is particularly interested in the subject , but a complete file of the names of the writers is cross-indexed in the White House offices  --  a practice started by Mr. Hoover and denounced by me ever since to anyone who would listen . The whole problem of handling the White House mail has changed tremendously in the last twenty years , due primarily to the huge increase in lette-rs of every kind during the New Deal period . Prior to the arrival of F.D.R. at the White House , I had handled the entire mail by myself , except for some routine assistance in emergencies . This meant working holidays , Sundays and until midnight on many occasions , particularly when a change in administration might bring 10,000 unopened letters in one week . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to touch off the letter-writing instinct in most Americans . Or perhaps they had more time on their hands , and certainly they were worried . When the President told them to write to him about their troubles , they took him at his word by the hundreds of thousands . " Dear Mr. President : I am worried about how we are going to ? " " Dear Mr. Roosevelt : The children have no shoes to wear to school ? " " Dear Frank : I 've been driving a hack for ten years , but now ? " " Dear Sir : Your detestable attempts to destroy our system of ? " They were all worried in one way or another , and they seemed to feel that they must let Mr. Roosevelt know their hopes and fears . They came in so fast that we could n't count them , but within a week I had some 450,000 unopened letters stacked all over the office . I spent my entire time from 7:30 A.M. to midnight every day merely going through the stacks of letters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put a couple of desks in a basement room which had a dirt , floor , and ran temporary lights into it , so I could get away from the office and work without interruption . Finally , I took my problem to Rudolph Forster , the executive clerk , and he brought in the President 's secretary , Louis Howe . I told them that unless they just wanted to burn the letters or throw them away , we would have to have help . One man and one woman were brought in from other departments , but we soon decided that we would need a force of about fifty persons for a while . That was not easy , when you remembered that capable persons would be needed , and the departments were reluctant to let good clerks go . The Civil Service Commission was unable to provide the class of clerks needed . Forster finally decided we could get help from outside the Government service , and have them sworn in as employees of temporary agencies and detailed to the White House . There were plenty of capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and through my acquaintances I soon had hired twenty outside the classified service . They were happy to give up such jobs as they had and come to the White House . Then I heard from Forster again . He said that , in view of the President 's position toward civil service , he was afraid our action might arouse criticism and that we should again try to get clerks through regular channels . I blew my top . I told him these people had given up their jobs and that Ihad given my word they would be employed . If I could n't keep my promise , I said , I wanted him to get somebody else in my place . " Now , Ira , " he said , " do n't be precipitate . If you 've hired them , it will have to go through . " When it was all approved , I had the clerks , but nowhere to put them . We began expanding into the halls and other odd spaces , but still there was n't room . It was decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the street , and Col. Edmund Starling , of the Secret Service , and I went over to discuss the problem . We did n't get very far , being turned away with the State Department 's customarily diplomatic version of the runaround . We had to ask Mr. Roosevelt to direct that the rooms be commandeered , which he did . That was just the beginning of our migrations , however . When the President decided to rebuild the executive offices , we moved everybody over to the State Department rooms except me and my assistant . The two of us moved our desks and tables into the lower corridor at the east end of the White House , and worked there until the rebuilding was completed . Then we moved everybody back into the offices , and stayed there until President Truman ordered more rebuilding on the offices in 1946 . Our entire staff was moved to some temporary Army barracks behind the State Department , but no sooner had the move been made than Congress decided that the proposed rebuilding would mar the beauty of the White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never did get back to the executive wing . We finally fought another battle with the State Department , which was as obstructionist and as supercilious as ever , in order to get suitable offices , and in June of 1947 we moved into the offices which the Mail Department now occupies in old State . As usual , we had to make a lot of special preparations there to handle the crank mail and to maintain the system for protection of the President from anyone who might decide to send him a package of high explosives through the mail . In the next and last article in this series , I want to tell about how that is done , and about some of the queer ones we handled at the White House .
