Hitler had lost the gamble . Instead of consolidating his eastern front he had gambled on the capture of Stalingrad . But Stalingrad had held out and now was striking back at his advanced columns . In the midst of Herr Hitler 's frantic preoccupation with Africa the Russian winter offensive had exploded . In the central sector around Rzhev the Russians launched another attack . In both sectors Hitler 's troops stumbled backward over the frozen graves of Axis soldiers who had already died in the attempt to conquer Russia . <P> At Stalingrad . One night a fortnight ago the worn men of Major General Alexander Rodintsev 's 13th Guards Division crouched in their holes in the northwest district of Stalingrad and listened to sudden thunderous cannonading . The din was their own artillery . <P> It was the hour for which the 13th had waited . They were tough , soft-spoken men from Omsk and Barnaul in faraway Siberia . They had arrived in Stalingrad by forced marches-125 miles in one two-day trek-and there in the battered factories had taken up their positions . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assaults , hacked at by infantry and tanks , the gaunt 13th had held the ditches , the doorways , the alleys and the gutted buildings . On their holding depended the success of Marshal Timoshenko 's strategy . <P> Southeast of Stalingrad , Timoshenko 's forces were moving up . Under cover of subfreezing nights thousands of Russian soldiers were crossing the icy Volga on ferry boats , fishing boats and rafts , carrying with them the artillery , tanks and weapons they would need for a massive counterattack . Behind the bald , rolling Ergeni Hills south of Stalingrad , hidden by mists , they gathered and waited . In the cold dawn of Nov. 20 they attacked . <P> " The hour of stern , righteous reckoning with the foul enemy , the German Fascist occupants , has struck , " said the Order of the Day . " Make the enemy 's black blood flow in a river . Comrades , into the attack ! " <P> " The Foul Enemy . " In the Ergeni Hills the artillery awakened . That was the long awaited thunder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cannonading kept up without break for two and a half hours , pouring destruction into the German lines , disrupting communications , softening resistance . Under its cover Russian sappers swept forward to " delouse " German minefields . Over the frozen earth rolled Russian tanks , some of them dragging artillery . Mobile cannon followed , operating in massed groups , blasting holes in German positions that had already been spotted by Russian guerrilla intelligence . Night came and there was no letup . <P> As the attack started from the south , Soviet troops north of Stalingrad also launched an assault , moving in a great arc toward Serafimovich . Their purpose was to swing west and south , meet the southern columns and close a ring around the Germans ( see map ) . From Serafimovich prongs spread out like the curving tines of a peasant 's pitchfork . From the southern force , moving along the Stalingrad-Novorossiisk railway , prongs also curved off . One jabbed across the Don , severed the Stalingrad-Rostov railway , cut back east to squeeze Axis troops against Stalingrad . In Stalingrad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head backward . <P>
