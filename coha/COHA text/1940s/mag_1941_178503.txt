Jew-baiting Propaganda Minister Paul Joseph Goebbels , alarmed by the German people 's growing sympathy for the persecuted Jews , last week saw fit to publish a charter of antiSemitism . Excerpts : <P> &gt; " The Jews are our ruination . They contrived and brought on this war . With it they want to destroy the German Reich and our people . " <P> &gt; " There is no difference among Jews . Every Jew is the sworn enemy of the German people . " <P> &gt; " Anyone who . . . still cultivates private relations with him . . . must be appraised and treated the same as the Jew . Jews are the enemy 's emissaries among us . Whoever stands at their side deserts to the enemy in war . " <P> &gt; " The Jews are to blame for the war . They are suffering no injustice in the treatment we bestow on them . They more than earned it . " <P> &gt; " After defeat , the decent enemy deserves our generosity . But the Jew is no decent enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
