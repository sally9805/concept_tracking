The discussion of the nation 's first major postwar economic problem advanced one step last week . Jesse H. Jones , who bosses all the major Federal lending agencies , discussed what should be done with the U.S. Government 's vast hoard of war plants and equipment . <P> His Defense Plant Corp . alone owns all or part of 1,753 war plants worth $9 billion , DPC represents everything from 10% of U.S. steel capacity to 100% of a synthetic rubber industry bigger than the entire prewar domestic market . Until U.S. businessmen find out how the U.S. Government plans to dispose of this industrial machine , much of their own postwar planning is planning in a vacuum . <P> Last week , at a New York Board of Trade banquet , " Uncle Jesse " told 1,200 businessmen some of his own ideas on what should become of his war plants . Reassuringly-and for the umpteenth time-he insisted that " Government should get out of active industry as soon as it can . " Reassuringly , he said he thought a good deal of Government equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he enunciated a principle dear to the heart of the average Congressman : that " to avoid monopolies and too much concentration , local people should have the first call on such plants . " <P> But when Jesse Jones got down to plant prices the businessmen really began to listen hard . Most U.S. industrialists are torn between : 1 ) a longing to pick up a fine new plant cheap , 2 ) a horror of having competitive plants and equipment dumped on the market too cheap . Said Jones : " Business will do well to recognize the taxpayer 's investments when negotiating for Government-owned plants . . . and not expect too many bargains . " <P> From a political standpoint , or that of a shrewd bargainer , this concern for the taxpayer seemed sound . But as an overall policy for getting Government plants into private hands this had to be weighed along with other considerations . <P> By war 's end the taxpayer 's stake in these plants will represent , in dollars , almost a third as much as the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it can cheat the public and break a significant part of U.S. industry ; held for too high a price , it might do even more damage by wrecking any quick reconversion to peacetime production , and perhaps lead ultimately to much government competition with business . Come peace , Jesse Jones and colleagues will have a tremendous responsibility . For business skill of the first water will be needed to liquidate the monstrous estate of the defunct war-shrewdly enough to get the heirs their money 's worth and swiftly enough to save the heirs from ruin .
