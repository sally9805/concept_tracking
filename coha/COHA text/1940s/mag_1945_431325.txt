 | MY HUSBAND said I would have to look under every chair I sat in for snakes , scorpions , and centipedes . My mother-in-law in Holland said to take at least eight dozen sheets and pillow slips because , no matter how tough they were , they would n't last long under the beating they received on washday . My father-in-law said to remember always that in the Indies we whites were not living in our own country , but in a land of other peoples whose strange customs had prevailed for hundreds of years before the commencement of our own era . I should , like all good Dutch colonials , try to adapt myself to the native life on the island . Awed by all this , I told my family not to worry , for I would be back for a visit in two years and , looking at the map , said that I 'd go often for week ends to see friends in Manila. * Armed with advice , good intentions , and ideas about tropical living gathered from the movies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percolator and curtain materials were necessities .

Island of Heavy Rainfall and High Color Third largest island in the world , Borneo wears the Equator for a belt and lifts her leafy face through intense humid heat to some of the world 's heaviest rains , and to equally glaring sunlight .

Borneo 's lifeblood is the black oil flowing along her coastline . In some places , it is of such high quality that it can be used almost as it flows from the earth ( page 299 ) . It was oil which brought my husband and me to the island . It was oil to feed one of the largest refineries in the Far East at Balikpapan which kept us moving , pushing ever farther inland ( map , page 297 ) .

' They have little interest in the white man 's civilization except for his cotton goods and kerosene cans . Nor have they any love for the Mohammedan religion . For generations they have gone farther and farther inland in small , isolated groups that do not speak a common language and have little contact with each other .

Years ago the tassels of hair hanging from the hilt came from human heads , but I was never to see one which had anything more gruesome than goat 's whiskers for decorations . A Dyak Cremation One evening , after a day when the stench of raw rubber slabs being loaded on the river boat outside my door had been enough to give me a splitting head , my husband came home to say that it smelled like heaven compared with what he had been through .

Shark fins and turtle eggs , too , are export delicacies . Tortoise shell and mother-of-pearl are well known to world commerce . Because of the heavy rains , we were unable to attend the first part of the Dyak rite , after which seven days of rest are observed before the cremation begins . This first rite is a sacrifice to the dead . Years ago it was a priestess who was sacrificed . Tormented , bleeding , and half-dead , as a circle of Dyaks slashed her with their parangs , she would fall finally into a deep pit where she was left to die . From these times until 1937 , when the last rites were held here , a sapi ( native cow ) took the place of the old woman , since Dutch law forbade further human sacrifice . It had taken generations of patient compromise to eradicate from the Dyak code their custom of human sacrifice . It was possible that even in its modified form this might be the last ritual of its kind . The cremation had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to the balai , or community house . Here , in the semidarkness , stacked in neat piles , were the coffins . An old priestess constantly prayed over them . The close air held the scent of herbs , coconut oil , and food . A bowl of liquid and a kerosene lamp were on the only table . The lamp cast weird shadows through the balai as the witchlike woman , seemingly in a trance , walked and crouched among piles of caskets . In her faded sarong and jacket , a pillow-shaped turban on her head , the old hag mumbled a prayer to ghosts through toothless jaws . At the same time she splashed liquid from the bowl or threw bits of rice and dried herbs from her dirty scarf to the coffins . Several bodies occupied each coffin , and a carved bird or snake 's head on the prow signified whether a man or woman was the eldest of the family dead contained therein . 300 Sets of Bones Food , crockery , and clothing were piled near the 3-foot-long receptacles . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 296 The National Gec  | From the eerie gloom of the balai we went to find sunshine . There , looking up at us , we met the eyes of a very scrubbed and smiling old gentleman . It was unusual to see anyone here dressed so neatly in white European clothing . Even more startling was the Maltese cross of the Willem 's Order , highest military decoration of Holland , so seldom bestowed . The charming old man wore the cross on his breast and explained in perfect Dutch that he had inherited it from his father , a Dyak chief and a Christian . The chief 's tomb was built by the Indies government just outside the kampong . Here roses struggled to grow over the simple concrete building . Pots of freshly cut gardenias were at the door , and a beautiful painted plaque in memory of the great chief hung on the wall inside . The fact that the receptacles holding the gardenias were nothing more than battered pots de chambre did not detract from the whole effect , for here was a combination of primitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our way over little bridgelike paths of bamboo running in all directions from the balai built for these observances and walked the mile through jungle to the funeral pyre . Those chosen to cook and distribute the food must not touch the earth until the three weeks ' ceremonies are concluded . In the clearing we took our places on a rickety platform built of saplings with a wide bamboo ladder for steps . At the other end of the platform , slightly raised above our level , was the pyre . It was nothing more than very green saplings placed like a picket fence against a railing . Back of this , in the ground , was a deep pit . Slowly , with chanting , came the families bearing food offerings and coffins from the balai . As the clearing quickly filled with Dyaks , I noticed how much lighter in color were these natives than the typical Malays I saw in the Indies . Most of the faces had a resemblance to the Chinese . Their religion also showed Chinese influences , tracing back to the centuries when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peoples of Borneo . A family took their places on the platform . The women squatted in front of us near the pyre . The men lifted the first coffin , prow end containing the skulls upward , to rest it vertically against the fence of saplings . Two bodies were in this coffin , a baby and an old man . For each a white chicken was struck against the lid of the box to kill it before it was thrown over the coffin into the pit , to be followed by water and food for the dead . A dry branch of a tree was brought to stand against the coffin , its twigs filled with little cakes , fruits , and small bundles of food wrapped in banana leaves . The fire was not large . It burned slowly . creeping gradually up the wooden boxes . The men pressed sticks against the flat lid to keep it from falling as the fire loosened its bindings . Then , suddenly , it burned furiously . The cover fell away and charred bones began to drop out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered their heads . swaying and moaning in conventional grief . Suddenly the whole coffin flared up . A skull rolled down into the flaming mass . There was quick action , as men and women drew short knives from their belts . These were held for a moment between their owners ' teeth ; then the flat side was pressed to their foreheads and held out to touch the foreheads of every person within reach . Burial of the Bones Finally , as the bones became blackened bits . the women prepared an iron pot for the remains , lining it with the clothes of the dead . The fire was extinguished with water mixed with coconut liquid , poured from special gourds prepared and blessed for this purpose . Speedily the remains were collected into the pot ; the women carried them away as the men cleared into the pit all that was left , making ready for the next family to cremate its dead .

Millions of insects began their evening songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , into a noisy accompaniment for moans of the mourning and the crackle of fire , which continued through the night and into the next day . As we stumbled back to our car through mud and darkness , we realized again , as we did so often while living among these primitive peoples , that although dying holds no very great fears for them , the ghosts of the dead are a constant terror , making the night hideous with the haunting of evil spirits . Everything must be done to placate the ghosts ' tenacious evil will , which brings disease and sorrow on the living . The last of the ceremony , which took place after another seven days of rest , we missed because of floods . This is a fight between the living and the ghosts of the dead .

We were whisked away from the dock in a Buick touring car over asphalt roads that ran through an unbelievable array of factory shops and all the hustle and noise of a great refinery . Somehow , before seeing Borneo , I had imagined that a bullock cart would be my means of travel , a coolie going on ahead to cut down the lianas choking our path . We needed no bullock cart , however , for wherever one could go there was an oiled road , and there were cars to carry us , or boats for inland travel . Occasionally , along the road , there was a village with cozy homes or an oil field .

It is customary and necessary to know the Malay language if one lives in the Indies . Many of the 70,000,000 islanders speak only their native tongue , but Malay is commonly used and understood . Since the islands are the country of the Malays , where , legally , a white person may own land only under certain conditions , Hollanders do not demand that Dutch be spoken to them . They use Malay in the Indies as they would use French in France or English in the United States . My first months in Borneo were spent in pantomime , as I sat at the sewing machine making curtains and frantically learning Malay and Dutch . Moving into 16 houses in ten years , I found both houses and housekeeping were much the same . Before furniture was brought in , floors and walls were washed with a disinfectant . Under the rugs a layer of old newspapers was spread . They were mostly old American papers . From them I could learn what had been going on in Boston and Galveston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because the ravenous flying cockroach does n't appreciate newsprint , he will at least not eat the underside of the rugs .

In the newest homes , however , a metal screen enclosure around the beds makes a cool , sure protection . During the day a burning punk keeps the dangerous malaria carrier at a distance . The netting and a clean water supply are perhaps of the greatest importance in maintaining a happy , healthy Indies home . Rain water collected from tin or shingle roofs into cement containers or oil drums serves for drinking , cooking , and generally for bathing . This water must be boiled for 20 minutes . filtered through porous stone , and boiled again before it is safe to drink . The few later types of city homes are built on the ground . The greater number of older houses may lack in beauty , but , built high off the ground on stilts , they are immensely more practical protection against reptiles and bugs . and the breeze sweeping beneath keeps them cooler and far less damp .

After years of persuasion , the heavy clothes iron filled with glowing charcoal was replaced by an electric iron . The ironing board , however , served only as a stand for cooking utensils , while on the large kitchen Mother Worries table the laundress was able to turn out an expert job of ironing . Among other things , I learned that if servants are obviously distrusted , or feel condescension shown them , they are likely to quit at a moment 's notice .

Color and creed make no difference in judging whether a person is noble or ignoble . One should not judge the natives by our standards before learning to understand their own Mohammedan religion and age-old customs . Gentle , law-abiding , and peace-loving as most Indonesians are , they are controlled by Mohammedanism . It sets rigid , high standards , but these standards do not always coincide with our own . Tasmi and Atmah , like many others , were admirable , judged by even our own code . They were intelligent , proud and high-principled , honest , sincere , and cleanly .

The night is passed in festivities and dancing to the music of gonged gamelans ( orchestras in which percussion instruments predominate ) . Shadow plays recount long stories of gods and goddesses .

Instead , you wait for your yearly vacation in Java to purchase a sorely needed supply. * We did without fresh milk or butter for all the years on the island and , until yeast was imported , we used dried hops to make all our own bread . Our stove was always a long block of cement with a trough down the middle under an iron grating . Fire in the trough created only a slight heat in the cavity , the section beneath which served as an oven . A kerosene can with one side cut into a flap made a better oven ? when a native used it .

There was a huge python in the high grass across the road . Yes , I had a chicken and would give them the long rope they wanted . Soon the fowl was tethered securely about a hundred yards from my front door .

Four-inch centipedes were at home in the dampness under potted plants , making gardening not always pleasant . Woolly spiders and black scorpions sometimes found their way indoors .

They say that one can survive the ordinary bite of any poisonous creature in Borneo if care is taken in time .

The man was found three days later unhurt , but the fright of his experience had permanently unhinged his mind .

Coolies working on oil wells catch large numbers of termites . They cook them on the hot pipes of the engine and make a feast of them . Always there were a few insects which followed the lights . But in the wet season many nights were made uncomfortable wherever a light burned . Screens in windows added just that last touch of heat which made a room unbearable . But when thousands of bugs were flying , screens afforded the only protection . Then the evening noises of the jungle entered our home in the metallic buzz-saw din made by cicadas and giant katydids . Usually green or brown , the cicada was sometimes striped in gay colors .

My husband was always bringing home a wah-wah , friendly gray gibbon , or a fawn , lost from its mother . Once a diminutive mouse deer , shiest of them all , wandered into my dining room . I fed them all and set them free . Many wild things , abandoned by their kind because of some subnormal condition , were nursed to health by kindly Europeans .

Kees , a red-haired baby orangutan , had special permission to live in the village , for these apes are protected by the Government and are rarely allowed in captivity . He had the friendliness and mischief of a two-yearold boy . Hans was a deer who bullied the dogs with his antlers . Pete , a solemn , stifflegged marabou , visited tea tables in the gardens . Ever-present sparrows twittered in the leaves and hornbills squawked in the distance . Suddenly , on walks through the jungle , we would come upon a cleared space where the ground was trampled to a hard floor . This was the dancing place of the argus pheasant .

Aroma of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jungles held a particular smell , forecasting the time of ripening for the strange tree fruit . Soon an intangible odor permeated villages and jungle alike , and the market was full of durians for sale . The large , hard , prickly-skinned durian is very popular with the Indonesians . Europeans who can not learn to eat it are sorely tried during the short season of the ripe fruit . I started eating durians in self-protection , as one eats onions when everyone else does . At first this was no real triumph , for after I had managed to get close enough to one ? fingers pinching nose the soft , creamy sections of the fruit seemed quite unpleasant to my taste . Perseverance brings great satisfaction , however . To eat a durian is to learn to like it . even though the nearest thing to it in consistency and flavor would be a mixture of melting maple mousse and garlic .

There were so many different , tangy flavors that our buffet could always hold a colorful basketful . Orchids of Many Colors Surpassing the fruits in exotic color and diversity ? indeed , vying in beauty with the moths ? are the orchids . The path to my house was lined with potted ground orchids . The wire netting of our chicken coop hung with some 18 varieties . Besides the big lavender ones there were sprays of inch-high white pigeons , lifelike scorpions , tiny yellow-andbrown bees , and many others , in shape and color resembling insects and butterflies . Many orchids have no scent . My favorite . however , had the heavy fragrance of tuberoses . In shape and size like the common lavender blossom , in color vivid chartreuse green and velvety black , these exotic flowers held almost a sinister fascination in their startling shades and heavy perfume .

From there on , our 65-foot boat made about twelve miles an hour for three days . Samarinda was the last European settlement . Past Tenggarong , home of the Sultan , native villages were scarce . We were alone in a green world of pure primitive living , on a highway of shining brown water where there were no straight stretches or long-distance views . Except for an occasional crashing fall of a heavy dead branch , the jungle was almost silent . Numberless shades of green composed the jungle , while the type of foliage gave variety and quality to colors . There were the deep , dull shades of the wild-rubber leaves : the gray-green needlelike tassels of the tjimara  | A Desperate Passenger to Borneo Goes Asl When aroused , the water buffalo is fierce .

Waringin , a fig , and other spreading shade trees tried to force space for their thick branches .

Only at the highest point , which each tree seems struggling to reach , does the blue sky begin to show . Dead trees , still upright because there is no place to fall , make streaks of tan or startling beige . Half-dead trees with yellowing or red- brown leaves add an autumn touch . Young growth brings vividness , while occasional flashes of red , delicate lavender , and small cascades of white pigeon orchids lend excitement . There was much we could not see , many blossoms blending their small loveliness with the dense vegetation .

One could believe that the lower trees were giving thanks for this momentary glimpse of the wonders they would perhaps someday reach in their struggle to grow tall . Our voices were stilled in awe at the beauty surrounding us .

As the night stretched black curtains across the sky and huge solitary bats appeared , a crescendo of sound filled the jungle .

Their pastor and three brothers met us at the dock , wearing long white robes and wide smiles , for we were the first white people they had seen in nearly a year . Soon we met the four nuns , who showed us through the mission school for boys and girls . Life Lonely at Tring Here were about one hundred pupils learning simple arithmetic , trades , and housekeeping . In the nearly forty years of the mission 's existence , its main contribution to the natives had been what it could teach of a common language and what very little its pupils would take to their widely scattered tribes . Intelligent , hospitable , excelling many other peoples in truthfulness and honesty , few Dyaks have as yet adopted modern ways and Christianity . It was a lonely life at Tring . All the missionaries had grown old there . One of the nuns had been as far away as Samarinda only three times in 30 years .

Many old tree stumps under the water endangered our small craft . In this dry season , here where the river was shallow , we should have seen literally hundreds of wild pigs crossing the water . But the jungles kept the secret of where all creatures were . Seldom did we see more than swaying branches or bending grass to tell us that animals watched us pass . Finally a reef of rocks under the water made it impossible for us to go farther . There had been no rain for several weeks . One good downpour in the watershed farther up would have giver : the river depth enough , but no rain came . There was no kampong where we could hire native dugouts , as we had hoped to do a day farther on .

These men came from distant villages to perform their witchcraft for several days . Even here , so close to a mission , sorcery was constantly practiced , and the medical care the mission afforded was taken advantage of only after the spells had been unsuccessful and the patient was at death 's door . The whole kampong was one huge house about 1,000 feet long . Built on piles several feet above the ground , the house had hardly a nail to hold it together . There was a wide veranda along the front length , from which doors led into separate rooms . Each was the home of an entire family . from grandparents to swarms of babies  | Clitrord A.

Everything from dried meat and herbs to clothing hung from the rafters . In the darkness we searched each room until we found the one where the sorcerer was at work . Through the long hours between dark and dawn the dancing witch doctor and his assistants fell into trances , fainting frequently near the end . Evil spirits are thought to enter the body of the sorcerer , finally to be expelled with smoke and flames from the fire lit in his headdress . It was an eerie ritual to see . Leaning against the wall , sitting , standing , and lying on the floor were some thirty members of the Dyak family . Players of wild , surging gong music , frenzied dancers , tense faces and naked bodies of all the gathering were lit only by flickering firelight and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor . In the sun were assembled all the Dyaks , crowding the wide veranda and steps . Under the trees , girls from the Catholic school sang Dyak words to the tune of " America . " Several Dutch folk songs were sung in the Malay and Dyak languages . Then a little princess from a faraway tribe shyly danced and sang an improvised song of greeting to the white guests . Dance of the Wild Pig The men of the village danced covered from head to foot in costumes of fringed banana leaves . Grotesque white-and-red wooden masks hid their faces as they slowly danced , imitating wild pigs . A hunter , calling impromptu jokes to amuse the audience , blew imaginary poison arrows from his long blowpipe or stuck the " pigs " with the sharp metal point on the end of the pipe . Clinging from palm trees by his bare toes , dancing and shouting , he made the audien scream with delight .

Dyaks are taller than the true Malays and often handsome . The majority of the women and some of the men have ears stretched from six to ten inches long . Into a hole pierced in a child 's ear is inserted a plug of wood . When the lobe has stretched to an inch in length , a silver ring , thick as a pencil and bracelet-size in diameter , is inserted . Weighing the ear down further , more rings are gradually added , until a dozen or more jangle on their owner 's breast ( page 311 ) . As the girls reach the age of ten , it is customary to tattoo feet and hands . The job is finished when they are about 15 years old . The tattooing fluid is made from the juice of various trees and results in an unattractive dark-bluish color .

The Dyak Style in Sarongs The women wear sarongs that are more like long aprons than skirts . The top corners cross to tie around the waist . Being very narrow , the sarong opens in the back , leaving little or nothing as a covering from the thighs down . A two-inch-wide band of reed , covered with red material , is worn on the head . The Dyak hobby of beadwork shows here to advantage . From the back of the head the hair hangs over a stiff frame covered with material . In deference to the near-by mission most of the women wore cotton jackets , but often above the waist there is no covering at all . A proud and handsome gentleman , the chief of the village , introduced us to his wife and mother , who wore gala dress different from that of other women . Shyly they told us that the richly woven , almost brocadelike materials and their curious beaded caps had been handed down from generations long dead .
