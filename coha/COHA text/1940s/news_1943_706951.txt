txt Mr. Wood on Planned Parenthood On Saturday before I saw THE TIMES I was called by a friend , who asked me whether I had been correctly quoted . On reading Column 5 , Page 18 , I found that the headlines and the first sentence seemed to give the impression that I was advising religious agencies to give birth control information . That was probably based on the first paragraph in Column 6 , in which I said that " young homemakers should have the benefit of adequate guidance through the proper health , educational , social and religious agencies in matters pertaining to child spacing and the economic , psychological , social and spiritual aspects of marriage . " Nothing I said would justify an interpretation that I was urging religious agencies to give birth control information . specifically stated that the technical aspects of planned parenthood are in the province of the medical profession and not of the minister .
