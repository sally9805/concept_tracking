PHYSICAL pain is a disrupting force that must be eliminated as far as possible among our fighting men . It is a complex phenomenon whose analysis has taxed the best brains in medicine . We all know that , from an unpleasant sensation , pain may become intolerable . When it is intense and long continued , it changes the whole person . As W. K. Livingston stated in his book " Pain Mechanisms , " " It interferes with thought processes , it disturbs sleep , impairs appetite , undermines morale , and may disorganize the functioning of every part of the body . " To allay pain , physicians can employ a vast variety of techniques and many drugs . These are fitted as closely as possible to the needs of the case . In some instances , a doctor is able to remove the cause of the pain . This , of course , is the ideal treatment . Very frequently , however , it ca n't be done . Then the physician can dull the receiving mechanisms of the pain sensations , or he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pain stimuli are transmitted , or he can sq affect the brain , by means of drugs , that it does not perceive or register the sensation of pain . The last-named method is the one most commonly employed . The drugs most effective in " dulling the brain " against pain are morphine and its derivatives . It is in this connection that the new synthetic analgesic , Demerol , is important . This drug -- created as a substitute for atropine and morphine ? was first introduced in 1939 . Its development not only adds a valuable agent to our analgesics , but promises to relieve us of dependence on foreign countries for opiates . Precious as are the sulfa drugs and blood plasma , Demerol and the other pain-killers must rank first with the man in pain . This fact , coupled with the difficulties encountered in sterilizing needles and syringes in fighting areas , has stimulated development of convenient and practical units for quick administration of analgesics . One . of these units ? meeting the strict specifications for such equipment ? is being made in quantity by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the Hypomatic . A " one-shot " automatic injection instrument , it is a compact unit 414 inches long , consisting of a sealed , long-necked ampoule containing the solution to be injected and also an inert gas under approximately two atmospheres of pressure . Its sterile needle is protected by a removable glass tube that hugs the collar of the needle . Injection is made rapidly and simply , the gas expelling the analgesic automatical- ly . It may be used with equal facility and effectiveness by tank and submarine crews , airmen , and other fighters far removed from formal medical stations . Another single-dose hypodermic unit has been developed by E. R. Squibb &; Sons , Mader War Department encouragement . It called the Syrette , and consists of a collapsible tube , the neck of which is affixed to a hypodermic needle . Found on the wartime list of analgesics s an old friend ? cold ? in a thoroughly new guise . Producing analgesia by freezing , which employs a spray of ethyl chloride , is an old technique . It has long been used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has largely been replaced by infiltration ? the injection of analgesics such as novocain . But another form of freezing has been developed and is proving of real value . It dates back to 1938 , when Dr. Temple Fay , of Philadelphia , sought to arrest growth of cancer by lowering the patient 's body temperature . In experiments ,  | subjects were packed in ice . Their body temperatures declined . They became drowsy and relatively insensible . As a treatment for cancer , " body freezing " proved valueless , but , as is frequently the case in science , the experiment which failed in one respect proved fruitful in another . In this instance , it was found that freezing relieved intractable pain . Dr. Frederick M. Allen , of New York , used it to develop a surgical treatment for gangrene of the extremities . He applies packed ice to the part after constricting it with a tourniquet . Amputation can then be made without additional analgesics , and the patient suffers no pain and virtually no shock . No less interesting are the new ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For instance , there is the recent application of spinal analgesia to obstetrics to produce painless childbirth . It is in the form of the so-called continuous caudal analgesia , which is a new and novel extension of the technique to deaden the lower nerve centers of the spinal cord so that they do not transmit any sensation of pain . Analgesics are being used effectively in psychotherapy in Britain and the United States . They produce prolonged sleep and also a mental state not unlike that seen in hypnosis . The prolonged sleep is applied to relieve the sufferers of intense emotional excitement and anxiety . The hypnotic state is utilized for diagnosis . In a condition of " half-sleep , " the patient can understand and respond to questions . His critical faculties become such that he is inclined to talk freely about things he ordinarily would suppress or would not remember . By means of this type of hypnosis , the psychiatrist is frequently able to arrive at the crux of the patient 's difficulties in a shorter time than would be required in other forms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
