txt Sinister control of the Republican majority in the Legislature - by a handful of political leaders , headed by Edwin F. Jaeckle , so that the killing or enactment of legislation depended upon how it affected the candidacy of District Attorney Thomas E. Dewey for the Republi can Presidential nomination , was charged last night by Governor Lehman . Governor Lehman , who spoke at the dinner given by the New York Young Democratic Club for Postmaster General James A. Farley at the Hotel Astor , . did not mention Mr. Dewey by name , but his reference to " a particular Presidential candidate represented in Albany by the new Republican State chairman " made his meaning clear . The Governor declared that the Legislature took no important step without the permission of Mr. Jaeckle , the new Republican State Chairman , and that this control had resulted in a completely unbalanced-budget , - authorization of expenditures far-in excess of prospective receipts , the cutting of needed appropriations for relief , and the defeat of virtually every progressive measure that had , been introduced . " Even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search and seizure were killed , " he added . Tributes to Mr. Farley as a Cabinet member and as a party builder were paid by Governor Lehman , United States Senator Robert F. Wagner and other speakers . Mr. Wagner declared " no office within the ? gift of the American people is too - high for him to fill with distinction . " - Governor Lehman praised Mr. Farley as a great Postmaster General and political leader , who realized that party success depended upon service to all citizens . This had been the guiding principle of the Democratic party , he asserted , and his guiding principle and that of his predecessors , Alfred E. Smith and Franklin D. Roosevelt . " What great contrast that is to the attitude of the present Republican leaders , " the Governor said . " At the 1939 and 1940 sessions of the Legislature we have witnessed what in my opinion constitutes one of the greatest backward steps in representative government within my memory . " We have seen the elected legislative representatives of the majority Republican party completely controlled by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was or could be taken by the Legislature throughout the sessions without permission from the present // LEHMAN ASSAILS BACKERS OF DEWEY // Republican State chairman , Edwin F. Jaeckle , and the small group of Republican political leaders who to all intents and purposes served as the Legislature of the State of New York . " The bewildered Republican legislative leaders did not dare to call their souls their own . They were completely under the control of this small group of powerful Republican political leaders . " In the twelve years I have been in Albany I have never seen anything which could approach the sinister situation which existed during the last two sessions of the Legislature . " The 1940 session of the Legislature is a very clear example of the power and the evil of ' back-room ' control by men not responsible in any way to the electorate but who none the less completely and ruthlessly controlled a supine Legislature . " That control forced the legislative leaders to leave a completely unbalanced budget ; to authorize over my protest expenditures far in excess of prospective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to defeat virtually every progressive measure that was introduced . Even the bills to outlaw the ' dirty business ' of wire-tapping and unlawful search and seizure were killed . " Legislation was not considered on its merit . Legislation was not considered in the interest of the people of the State . Legislation was enacted or killed , depending on how it might affect the fortunes of a particular Presidential candidate represented in Albany by the new Republican State chairman . " These same Republican leaders who have betrayed and failed the people of New York now seek the power to administer the affairs of the nation . " We Democrats have kept faith with the people of the State . We have made good our promises . We have redeemed our pledges . We have justified the confidence that the people have reposed in us . " Farley Gets Medal In presenting to Mr. Farley the club 's medal for distinguished service Thomas F. Boyle , president of the club , made allusion to the Postmaster General 's hope for a place on the Democratic national ticket by saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man at Grassy Point and that his friends hoped that he would go farther . Mr. Farley , after commending the Roosevelt Administration for having done much to bring the country out of the critical condition the President found at the beginning of his administration , declared that full recovery could come only through " cooperation . " " The solution of our economic problem seems to me to be a simple one , " he said . " Why not bring together in frank discussion the leaders of industry , transportation , finance , agriculture and labor ? Let them submerge their selfishness . Let them acquaint each other with their problems . If they do , and are frank with each other , I am confident that out of such a discussion a workable plan that will fit in with the liberal economy of the present day can be formulated . This solution is possible and sound . " Appeals to Youth Mr. Farley appealed to the youth of the nation to carry the message of cooperation to their fellow workers and employers until it was brought about 15y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " We stand 100 per cent behind the Roosevelt policy of foreign relations . We want no part of the war in the other hemisphere and we will permit no part of it to come to this hemisphere . We are as one in building up our defense forces to protect the peace of the Americas ; and we are likewise as one in demanding that these forces be kept at home . We devoutly pray that the power plutocrats will soon be forced out by their own peoples , so that the world can go back to its way of progress under normal conditions . ' When that day comes , the people of America will be glad to cooperate with any nation that is sincerely desirous of promoting peace and amity among all the peoples and for all time . " In concluding his speech Mr. Farley returned to his proposal for cooperation . He said : " I offer a program of cooperation as an admirable way out of our difficulties . Cooperation among the thirteen colonies brought forth our nation . Cooperation among individuals built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the farmers built rural America to a pre-eminence that is the envy of agriculture the world over .

During the century and a , half of our growth from colonies to empire cooperation has been the foundation of our success . Why look further afield ? We now have the laws to make easy the use of cooperation . Let our leaders sincerely try to use it , and I prophesy that the America of the future will be a land of progress in keeping with the best traditions of the America of the past .

In praising Mr. Farley , Senator Wagner said : " Jim Farley 's stature is not to be measured by the vast throng here tonight . He has the confidence and affection of the people of America , in North and South , in East and West . He started his career with no resources except his own talents and character . The story of his steady upward climb to national fame and national office embodies in full measure the rich promise of American opportunity . He has risen to meet progressively greater tasks with ever-increasing ability , until today no office within the gift of the American people is too high for him to fill with great distinction . " References to Mr. Farley 's boom for the Democratic Presidential nomination were received with applause . Twenty-five hundred persons attended , among them Attorney General Robert H. Jackson , Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins , Lieutenant Governor Charles Polietti and most of the party leaders from New York City and many from the rest of the State .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
