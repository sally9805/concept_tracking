txt As the most important single result of Tuesday 's elections , we face for the first time in sixteen years a situation in which an American President will be confronted two months from now by an adverse party majority in Congress . This is a situation for which the framers of the Constitution did not plan , for they did not foresee the development of the party system . It is a situation which has arisen only infrequently in American political history , and it is obviously a situation fraught with special strains and difficulties . In the present case the gloomier prophets on the Democratic side , no doubt looking back to the experience of Woodrow Wilson after 1918 and of Herbert Hoover after 1930. have predicted that this division of political power will be followed by dire consequences . On the basis of such earlier experience they have forecast both a break in the continuity of American foreign policy and a paralysis in the Government 's handling of critical domestic issues . * * * If we turn first to questions of foreign policy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republican and the Democratic positions , as developed by the members of the two parties on the floors of Congress . These differences relate chiefly to matters of international finance and economics . The British loan , one of the most important of all issues to be raised at the last session , was opposed by a majority of Republicans in both the Senate and the House . Again , a majority of Republicans in both branches of Congress voted last year against an extension of the Hull reciprocal trade agreement program . which is now the key measure of our foreign economic policy . In both these important matters a party previously hostile to present policy now comes into power on Capitol Hill . We must recognize the presence of this new factor in the international picture . But we must also note , in order to round out that picture , these two additional factors : ( 1 ) that no other foreign loans on the scale of the British loan are now contemplated by the Administration , and ( 2 ) that under existing law the Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reciprocal trade agreements . Existing law in this respect could , of course , be repealed . But there would scarcely be , either in the new House or the new Senate , a twothirds majority for such repeal , sufficient to override a Presidential veto . We must also note that on other highly important questions of foreign policy , aside from these two matters , the Republicans in Congress have given the Administration consistently strong support since the war 's end . The United Nations Charter was ratif=ied in the Senate by a vote of 87 to 2  --  and of the two Republicans who constituted the minority on this issue Mr. Shipstead of Minnesota has now been disposed of by the Republican voters themselves . On the supplementary question of adopting the United Nations Participation Act , giving the President unprecedented power to make American forces available to the Security Council to halt aggression , all but a handful of House Republicans approved and the Republican vote in the Senate was 23 to 6 in favor . In fact , with respect both to the United Nations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council of that organization must enforce , the whole policy of our Government has become increasingly a bipartisan policy . This is clearly shown by the . activities and responsibilities of Senator Vandenberg and Senator Austin , and by the strong approval and support of these activities by the Republican rank and file . Indeed , it is interesting to note  --  and particularly important for foreign observers to note that the only really formidable attack on the Administration 's foreign policy since the end of the war has come not at all from the Republican side , but from a Democrat , Henry Wallace , Who has condemned the Administration 's position on such basic points as Russia , Eastern Europe , armaments and the atomic bomb . It is Mr. Wallace , and not Mr. Vandenberg or Mr. Austin or Mr. Taft or Mr. Dewey , who is now the unquestioned Leader of the Opposition on questions of foreign policy . And in the light of this situation , and of the whole record since the war 's end , we believe that the nations now associated with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of the Republican victory in the Congressional elections will be an American retreat into the prewar ways of political isolation . * * * In the field of domestic policy  --  as contrasted with foreign policy  --  the outlook is complicated by the fact that on domestic issues there are now four parties , rather than two , in Congress : Northern Democrats and Southern Democrats , industrial Republicans and agrarian Republicans . Nevertheless , even with this variety of opinion , there are certain areas of action in which cooperation between a Democratic President and a Republican Congress should not be beyond achievement . One such area is the future of price control ; for , by and large , the Congressional Republicans are in favor of prompt termination of controls , and the Administration itself has recently been moving full speed in that direction .. Another area in which there is at least a declared identity ' f aims is in the critically important field of Federal finances . The President is committed to a prompt balancing of the national budget , and the Congressional Republicans , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " cut down extravagant expenditures , " will now find the center of the stage all set for them to redeem these fervent pledges . Agreement on questions of social legislation will doubtless be more difficult to achieve ; but even here the most immediately important single measure , the Wagner-Ellender-Taft Housing Bill , ' has had bipartisan sponsorship , if not bipartisan support . Labor legislation of some kind there must and doubtless will be , and that problem is beset with difficulties . But here the President himself hasp defined a reasonable goal and a promising method of procedure , on which bipartisan cooperation could well be achieved . Warning against hasty , ill-considered and merely punitive measures , he declared : " Affirmative action is called for . * * * Where excesses have developed on the part of labor leaders or management , such excesses should be corrected  --  not in order to injure either party  --  but to bring about as great an equality as possible between the bargaining positions of labor and management . Neither should be permitted to become too powerful as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these matters what is urgently needed is prompt recognition , both by the President and by the Republican leaders , of the real risks inherent in an interregnum in which authority is divided between an Executive and a Congress of different political loyalties . Only confusion at home , and a weakening of American influence abroad , can result from an attempt on either side to exploit this divided authority for partisan advantage . The need is for close consultation on all major issues , moderation on both sides and generous cooperation in the national interest . The country will know in 1948 how to assess credit and blame for the record that is written in the next two years .
