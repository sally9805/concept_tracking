txt WASHINGTON , Dec. 22 ? Patiently all day long a large group of reporters waited at the President 's executive offices today , and , whether or not as patiently , their editors in distant cities waited , too . Every one knew that a most important announcement was to be made at the White House , but they were in no doubt what it was to be . For at least two days a few had known , and since yesterday many had known , that the Prime Minister of Great Britain was approaching the United States and that the announcement would tell of his safe arrival . In view of these facts , the professional silence that was observed marks how responsibly and completely the reporters of the press and the radio , and those who edit and publish what they produce , have accepted the obligation the war has laid upon them . Only in one or two instances did any official of the government take steps to assure that what last night became well known to some who report the news in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then they only sought to make assurance doubly sure when by one means or another they discovered tha+ inquiries had been made which rendered it obvious the inquirer knew of the expected . The demonstration , therefore , was of " voluntary censorship , " a phrase dear to this government and that of Great Britain and applying solely to p - blications within the country ( incoming and outgoing messages are censored by law ) . As such , it was a complete success . The news was thrilling and important enough to have been valued by any reporter as a more than fair exchange for his eye-teeth . And some , by a joint process of deduction and observation , were sufficiently confident of it several days ago . But there must be few if spy reporters or editors who , having reached such a conclusion , did not simultaneously realize that Mr. Churchill 's safety would be endangered , not only by publication but by the whisper of one man to another . If any exist without the wit to have realized that , or without regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luckily they never stumbled on the great secret . The overwhelming majority in the other category knew that what would endanger Mr. Churchill 's safety would endanger the war effort to which this country , with Great Britain , China , Russia , the Netherlands and other nations and national groups , are now committed and on which their future depends . That was sufficient to change a group , ordinarily keen to publish news as soon as they get it and inclined to discuss what for any reason they can not publish , into paragons of discretion and taciturnity . Those who , by a joint process of deduction and observation , had been early in concluding that Mr. Churchill was on his way to the United States , noted his repeated absence from the House of Commons a number of days ago . Then front official Washington sources statements began to be made that important conferences on allied strategy were being held here and would grow in consequence . What more vital discussion was there for Mr. Churchill to participate in , and did not that explain his absence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the affirmative , the attitude and speech of certain highly placed persons who would surely know of the event , if it were forthcoming , might furnish I certainty . By last Friday those who followed this process were fairly sure that their suspicion was about to develop into a fact . But at no point and in no circle ? save , accidentally , among some youngsters at a Christmas party  --  did the strongly supported suspicion get any circulation from those who held it , so far as this correspondent can discover . That ' is pretty good for a country and capital unused to keeping war secrets on which the lives of thousands may depend , and for a profession which exists to give the public the news . The case was so plain , however , so far from any borderline as to what should be reported or discussed and what should not , that it does not necessarily establish " voluntary censorship " as a successful system . When the military effect of publication is doubtful , or it does not occur to the gatherer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , more than a voluntary system is required . This is what has engaged the first attention of Mr. Price , the new censor of outgoing and incoming messages , and this is what will give him trouble unless a smoothly operating mechanism is developed . Censorship is so repugnant to democratic governments that here , as in Great Britain , they cling to the use and spirit of the word " voluntary " as tightly as they can . But in Great Britain they have learned to take no chances on borderline news , or news which would be recognized as taboo by experts only . They send out to the press and to the radio what are called " D Notices , " meaning " Do n't print that . " It is n't voluntary at all ; it is mandatory ; and it relieves from . the responsibility of making a decision those who should not have this responsibility imposed upon them . The United States Navy adopted this custom last Friday , sending out for the first time an announcement in which the words " Shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the government .
