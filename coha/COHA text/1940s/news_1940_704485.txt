If we join in these wars , he warned , there will be no one to do it . The cor filet , he said , is wanted by none of the common people of the world and therein lies a hope for peace . At the close of his talk , Mr. Hoover warned that in our indignation at wrong and aggression we must not be led into blind hates against whole nations . The vast majority of both the German and Russian nations " are gentle and decent people , " he added , and we must preserve ourselves from the " poisonous air of hate " if we are to exert a constructive voice in the peace .

There are said to be more than 150 correspondents here . The city is decked with flags . Because of the paucity of actual news and the extent of world attention focused here , there are naturally many rumors floating about . There are stories that Turkey is trying ' to mediate between Bulgaria and Rumania and that Rumania is taking an adamant stand in refusing concessions . There ? is other talk to the effect that Rumania is demanding pledges from the Entente members for aid in case she is attacked by Russia or Germany . The terms of the pact do not provide for such assistance except in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that Rumania will quit the Entente if these promises are not given and that the Allies are thinking of revoking their guarantee to Rumania .

Emphasis is being laid on avOiding provocation . Yugoslavia , whose policy parallels that of Italy for the moment , is taking the lead in efforts to keep Bulgaria friendly . However , there is no talk of territorial revision until after the present war is over . Economic cooperation will be the topic of the conversations tomorrow and it is thought the Entente members will seek to improve their own commercial relations with each other and also Bulgaria and Hungary .

It is believed that Mr. Saracoglu explained Turkey 's reasons for signing an accord with Britain and France , which strained the neutral position of the entente . Turkey points out that even if she is not strictly neutral she is out of the war . The meetings are being held in strict secrecy despite the publicity they are receiving , and most reports of a specific nature should be discounted . In fact , it is known that the visiting statesmen did not even send code telegrams reporting the discussions to their own capitals arid they are expected to wait until they return in order to give oral accounts . Automatic Support Unlikely BELGRADE , Yugoslavia , Feb. 2 ( A )  - -  Worried Rumania , squeezed between strong demands by Germany and the Allies for her oil , tonight was reported reliably to have lost her chances of winning guarantees of automatic support from her neighbors in the Balkan Entente .

This was an attempt to prevent being flattened between the conflicting demands of Germany and Russia on the one hand and France and Britain on the other . The Entente representatives were reported on high authority to have " agreed to disagree " immediately on their individual plans for keeping peace in Southeastern Europe . While ruling against any change in the Entente , they decided they would issue a communiqu ? stressing their " will " to settle all questions with their neighbors in a friendly manner and without force . Foreign observers said the meeting of the Ministers fully confirmed expectations that the divergent interests of these four nations gave little hope of concrete accomplishments toward reinforcing their alliance .
