FOR the big job of moving our airpower from Europe to the Pacific , an AAF engineering officer said , " We 've got to have the land . Then the bases have to be laid out and carved out . On these airdromes and back of them , we have to set up depots of various sizes . Next comes the equipment for the service units , and the stockpiles of materiel and housekeeping items . Fuel comes in.  | Then , and only then , are we ready to bring in the planes . " It is a transplanting operation of global proportions that involves every type of conveyance that moves on land , on sea , and in the air . And in carrying out this " bulk redeployment " of the AAF we had to start from scratch . We have not the land , the facilities , or the supplies on the scene , such as were available in England under reverse lend-lease ; and , with the exception of China , there is no ally in the Pacific from which we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shovel , screwdriver , gasoline drum , and box of rations must be sent from either Europe or the U. S. Either way , it is nearly halfway around the world . The planning for this tremendous task  | began in Washington almost a year before the Germans surrendered . Commencing in the offices of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , the Army-Navy Logistics Board , and Gen. " Hap " Arnold of the AAF , these plans coursed through channels all the way down to Joe Doaks and Mary Smith , who sort rivets in some two-by-four plant of a subcontractor in the alley back of Main Street . The elaborate plan calls for the moving of everything but the bases . Even the Army and Navy can not bulkredeploy airdromes , and these must be prepared and equipped in order that the redeployed AAF will have somewhere to go when it arrives in the Pacific . That is why the redeployment of aviation engineers , technicians , and some air units was under way when V-E Day arrived . The tactical demands of the Pacific areas make it necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seabees to lay out , build , and equip seven different kinds of air installations . These are described in the order in which they will be used to make possible the redeployment : Largest are " base facilities " that include service units , four-echelon depots , underground storage for fuel and bombs and other ammunition , weather and communications units , and living quarters . They will take on the aspect of regular staging areas . " Airbase areas " will include a number of landing strips or dispersal areas , and on these will be located personnel and facilities for administration , maintenance , supply , and salvage . " Airways stations " will be large airdromes with complete servicing facilities , which will be used , primarily , as stopover points for ferried planes . Some of these may be used for the assembly of processed planes that have been shipped . " Airbases " are somewhat smaller and are equipped with sub-depot or service squadron shops . The commanding officers of these may also have under their control alternate " sub-bases . " " Landing strips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Several of these , widely dispersed , constitute a " satellite field . " The redeployed engineers who are building these , or enlarging existing facilities , all over the Pacific area carried with them only the most essential equipment . Everything that they required was sent direct from the U. S. and cleverly scheduled and routed so as to reach the respective points at the same time as the men from the ETO and Mediterranean . This " marrying " of men and materiel is the most intricate single phase of our redeployment scheme . For example , the flow of materiel to Europe was so strong that we began last October to close the valve of this pipe line . In anticipation of the surrender of the Nazis and the possibility of having to reroute the shipments of aircraft and other weapons to the Pacific , a coding scheme was employed to govern ship movements and loadings . Some vessels were marked " STO , " meaning that they were to be stopped enroute in the event of the war 's end in Europe . Others were labeled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would be needed in any event . But many of these carried planes and parts . The other cargo was unloaded . but the planes were shipped back to the U. S. or routed through the Mediterranean to the Pacific . ( When V-E Day arrived , 89 ships were halted at sea or recalled from foreign ports without discharging cargo . ) If it seems incongruous that swiftly moving airpower must be anchored to the slowmoving convoys , this is so because of the great variety of things needed to keep an air unit in operation . Some of these items can not be transported by air in sufficient quantities . President Truman revealed recently that 20 bombardment  | groups had received orders to move from Europe to the Far East . This number of Flying Fortress and Liberator groups adds up to 960 bombers , plus spares . These will be flown to the Pacific areas , carrying with them combat crews and some 650 tons of immediately needed equipment . The air echelon required to keep ' em flying after these bombers arrive includes 4,440 specialists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of 960 Skytrain or Commando transport planes ? a fleet of planes that would take about four hours to pass over any given point . But this is the easiest part of the redeployment . The relatively simple expedient of transporting the planes , men and materiel by air presents none of the difficulties facing those who must prepare for the movement of the remaining personnel and equipment of the 20 bomber outfits . On the ground are left some 22,000 men and 15,800 tons of miscellaneous ground equipment that includes everything from bulldozers and 2 ? 2-ton trucks to hardware such as socket wrenches and nuts and bolts . Railroad transportation of this complement to the nearest port will require 2,140 flat cars , 520 boxcars , 484 coaches , and 200 kitchen and baggage cars . To embark these men and materiel , 10 Liberty ships and nine Army transports will be needed . Not taken into account is the stockpile of food and other essentials these men will consume during the 14,000-mile voyage to some Pacific point such as Manila . The moving of fighter outfits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not practical to ferry even the long-range Mustangs , Thunderbolts , Lightnings , and Black Widows over such distances . These  | fighters will be shipped , along with their combat crews , service personnel , and essential equipment . Comparatively few fighters will be sent from Europe to the Pacific . Only the latest modifications , and those in the best condition , are to be redeployed . Others will be returned to the U. S. for limited use ; still others are being scrapped for salvage . One officer of the Air Technical Service Command , whose job it is to supply the combat units , said , " It would save a lot of time , trouble , and expense to burn on the spot every small airplane that we wo n't use against the Japs ! " Fighters that will be used are being ferried from their unit bases to ATSC " processing centers " which are modeled along the lines of the Port Newark and Oakland Overseas Command bases , through which passes the flow of new aircraft to the Pacific combat theaters . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the huge installations here at home ; there can be no short cuts in this phase of redeployment . We can not afford to ship a fighter from 10 , - 000 to 14,000 miles and have it arrive unfit for immediate use . If we consider the redeployment of , say . ten fighter groups , each comprising some 75 planes and 1,000 men , plus spares and equipment , it adds up to a fair-sized convoy in itself . Thirty-three Liberties and tankers will be required to hold the planes and some packed parts ; five Victory ships and five transports will be needed to move the men and the heavier equipment . More than twice the shipping used to move 20 heavy-bomber groups is necessary to move only ten fighter groups and their planes . The men from the European theater who will fly these planes are being given , short indoctrination courses to acquaint them with the new planes and the operating conditions they will encounter in the Pacific . For the most part , these differences involve more over-water flying , more low-altitude flying in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rockets . Pilots who flew Marauder medium bombers in Europe are undergoing a three-months transitional course in A-26 Invaders ; so are some of the men who flew Mitchells . Only the latest B-25 modifications are being sent to the Far East , and these carry rockets . " If those Nips , " declared a procurement officer sagely , " had any idea today how big this thing really is and what we 're getting ready to throw at them tomorrow , they 'd have surrendered yesterday !
