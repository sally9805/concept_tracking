Jockey Ted Atkinson knew Capot 's peculiarities like a book : " If some other horse cuts out a dizzy pace , he is bull-headed enough to want to run him down . If you take a hold on him , trying to save something for the end , he gets ornery and wo n't run at all . " At the start of last week 's long Belmont Stakes , toughest test of U.S. racing 's " Triple Crown , " Atkinson hustled Capot into the lead and prayed that nobody would press him . <P> Nobody did for the first half mile . But straightening out on the backstretch , Eddie Arcaro let Palestinian move up alongside Capot . It was not a real challenge ; both riders had their horses under wraps . Lagging behind them was Calumet Farm 's stretch-running Ponder . <P> When Capot and Palestinian headed into the stretch five lengths in front of the field , Atkinson gave Capot the whip and pulled clear . He had Palestinian beaten . But where was Ponder ? Atkinson would never forget the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kentucky Derby won last month . As sometimes happens to slow beginners , Ponder had gotten mousetrapped down on the rail . When he worked free he put on a run that brought the crowd of 40,421 up on tiptoe . But 20 yards from the finish , Atkinson " turned his stick " and relaxed ; Capot nailed the $60,900 prize by half a length . Added to his victory in the Preakness , the Belmont copper-riveted his claim to 1949 's three-year-old championship .
