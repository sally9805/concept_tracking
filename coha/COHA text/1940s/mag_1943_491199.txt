AFRICA , WE TOOK IT AND LIKED IT By ROBERT WALLACE , ENSIGN , U.S.N.R. In Collaboration With PARKER MOREL ! . IT WAS midnight , cold , black and wet . Since sundown we had been racing at top speed toward the coast of Africa . Now , with engines idle , we were lying to about eight miles offshore . Our objective was the city of Safi , 140 miles south of Casablanca , French Morocco . We were scheduled to attack at four o'clock in the morning . Through the mist and rain squalls we could see its lights flaring dimly . But out on the Atlantic , where our task force was drifting , there was nothing but thick , inky silence . We had n't known where we were going when we left the United States . It was strictly a hush-hush operation . Warships , airplane carriers , transports and destroyers put out from a dozen different ports , cruised for some time at sea , and then suddenly came together to form the biggest armada in the history of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feinting now toward England and now far to the south , toward Dakar . It drove the Germans wild . They suspected a big invasion was in the wind , but had no way of knowing when or where it would strike . All they could do was to send wave after wave of submarines against us . We passed through three separate screens of them , each screen containing well over two dozen subs . Between the Azores and the Canaries  --  in submarine alley , as it 's called  --  there were about forty waiting for us . Our destroyers , though , were more than a match for them . Day and night they circled the convoy , dropping depth bombs . They apparently got a good many subs and we did n't lose a ship all the way . From the nature of the troops ' equipment , we guessed that our destination was Africa ; thoughwhat part of Africa , we could n't be sure . The goggles , mosquito bars and general lack of heavy clothing seemed to indicate the desert  --  perhaps Egypt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , five days away , they told us . An enormous second front was to be opened in North Africa . Our convoy would split up and attack the west-coast ports : Casablanca , Fedala , Port Lyautey , Safi and others . At the same time , another huge convoy from England , carrying mostly American troops , would enter the Mediterranean and invade Algiers , Oran and other north-coast ports . We began to realize the enormous amount of planning that had gone into this invasion , when the Army Intelligence boys took over . They had maps and photographs of everything . Some time earlier , British bombers had flown over Safi and had taken detail pictures of the harbor , the coast-defense installations and every prominent landmark . These pictures , combined with a wealth of incidental material , enabled us thoroughly to familiarize ourselves with the distinguishing characteristics of every point at which we were to attack . There were four beaches around Safi and these they designated by color : Red , Blue , Green and Yellow . We 'd land most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Army Intelligence lectured to us landing-boat men about them . They even had an artist draw pictures on the wardroom walls showing how those beaches would look from the water at night . By the time they were through , we could have found our way into Safi blindfolded . All around the ship other preparations were going forward on the same scale . Doctors checked over the men 's inoculation records . Anyone who hadn'tbeen shot for typhoid , yellow fever , typhus and anti-tetanus within the last six months was reinoculated . Our landing boats were gone over from stem to stern . Every nut and shackle was tightened , every grease cup and oil tank filled . Engineers even held buckets of sea water under the intake pipes and ran the motors until they were certain everything was in apple-pie order . Once they 'd been checked , the boat crews never left them again . The troops spent hours filing sharper points on their trench knives and bayonets , cleaning and oiling their tommy guns and Garand rifles , packing and repacking their equipment . Corporals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his two metal dog tags . These were stamped with his name , Government serial number , rating , blood type , the address of his next of kin , and the date of his last anti-tetanus shot . One dog tag even had each man 's thumbprint on the back . Morale was excellent . The men had been training for a long time and the prospect of seeing action was like a tonic to them . They sang and whistled all day . After the war , psychologists may write learnedly about this . I ca n't and wo n't attempt to . But one thing about that music did interest me . The ship had a public-address system over which , every noon , phonograph records were played . When the troops had their choice , they picked numbers like The Pennsylvania Polka , White Christmas , and other favorites from the Saturday-night Hit Parade . They knew the words and music , and always sang along with the records . But , on the other hand , when there was no phonograph music and the men sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they sang were the ones their fathers had sung on the way to France , twenty-five years before . Tunes like I 've Been Working on the Railroad , Over There , Marching Through Georgia , Annie Laurie , and one song they made up themselves . I 'll come to that later . Another interesting thing was this : once we got ready to go into battle , money suddenly became the most unimportant thing on the boat . There had been a craps game running twenty-four hours a day down in the troops ' quarters . It had started before our transport pulled away from the pier back in the States , I 'm told . But it ended abruptly as soon as our destination was announced . The moral here was obvious , of course . A dollar bill would n't bandage a wound or plug a bullet hole . The only important thing now was to have your equipment in tiptop shape . Our orders were to begin to put the landing boats over the side at midnight , Saturday , November 7 , 1942 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began . We used Higgins landing boats ; fast , highly maneuverable and almost impossible to capsize . Each boat is manned by four sailors , with one officer accompanying each formation of three . These crews are more or less the Navy 's storm troops , all being very young , very tough , and especially chosen fortheir work . The boats themselves are made of mahogany plywood , have no armor except for a steel door which slides down when the landing ramp is up . Because of their size and weight , it is n't easy to launch them from the high deck of a transport , even on a clear day . And when you set out to do it on a dark , wet night with a rising tide and a strong ground swell , you 've really got a job on your hands . Our deck force had some good officers . Exmerchant-marine men , most of them , who really knew how to get heavy loads in and out of a ship . Back home in practice something had nearly always gone wrong ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deck men had worried all the way across the Atlantic . But now , when the chips were down , Ensigns Larkin , Ellis and Mukhalian got the boats over in one of the quickest , smoothest performances any transport has ever given . As we hit the water we gunned our engines for a moment , and then shoved off to form a slowly moving , clockwise circle off the port quarter . When the last boat joined this circle , we started off to pick up some specially equipped infantry combat teams from another transport about half a mile away . The British usually launch their assault boats fully loaded . We do n't . Our Navy gets the empty craft into the water and then the troops climb down worst is over . ( Continued on Page 79 ) We 're so relieved we do n't care much about enemy gunfire , if there 's going to be any . Approaching the big transport , we could see a huge , phosphorescent wake churned up by her screw , as she slowly turned to create a lee side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an offshore breeze , the lee was to seaward . This was fortunate . It would hide all debarkation operations from anyone who might be watching on shore . Over the side of the ship were five cargo nets , each marked by a color . Sailors with blinker tubes stood by each net and at intervals flashed its color for a split second . When an officer on the transport 's bridge shouted over the public-address system , " Vehicle boat come alongside Blue ! " or " Personnel boat come alongside Red ! " we knew where to go . It was something like a carriage starter lining up automobiles in an after-theater traffic jam . Aboard the transport not a light showed except for the occasional flash of a color above the nets . Not even the faintest glimmer flickered up through the booby hatches leading to the cargo holds below decks where the troops were waiting . The air in the troop compartments was thick with cigarette smoke and faintly bluish in the dim glare of the battle lights . Occasionally , you could see the sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most of the men were sitting or lying on their bunks , talking in hushed voices . Now and then , one would light a match and for a minute you could see his hands and face , tanned and healthy after months of training . You could see that his fingers were n't shaking and that there was a lot of confidence in the tight set of his mouth . 4-F Charley Some of the soldiers were singing . They had a song called 4-F Charley . It will probably he the hit of World War II . Unfortunately , no two consecutive words are printable . It has to do with the activities of a citizen who spends his time drawing mustaches on that picture of yourself you left on your girl 's dresser , putting moths in your stored civilian clothes , and making constant efforts to cut you out with your girl . Great song . Tune of Flat-Foot Floogie . It was n't until we 'd taken aboard our load of troops that I knew exactly how we fitted into the attack pattern . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " We 've got Number Four position . Third wave . Green Beach . " That made everything clear . The waves of landing craft are made up so that each unit hitting the beach is perfectly self-contained . Its flanks and center contain the concentration of weapons . When you land on a beach , let go the ramps and the troops jump out , they 're all set to start an organized attack . Our boats were filled with troops by a quarter past three in the morning and we proceeded a short distance off the transport 's bow and formed another series of circles ; this time one for each landing wave . We had orders to stay in these rendezvous circles until a guide boat came to lead us in to shore . Just before the zero hour I counted six separate circles moving slowly off the bow of the ship . Then two specially fitted destroyers loomed up out of the darkness in front of us . Their funnels had been chopped off to give them a low silhouette . As they moved along , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trailed them . There was a double purpose in sending those destroyers with us . First , they contained a number of special troops below decks , who had specific jobs to do as soon as they got ashore . And second , all the knives , guns , grenades , bayonets and assorted scrap iron carried by the combat teams in our boats threw the compasses off so badly , we 'd have had tough going if we 'd tried to make the trip in by ourselves . At the mouth of the harbor , we were told , men from a submarine would be waiting in a rubber boat to  --  guide us in . They would use a special kind of blinker to signal us . This would he invisible to everyone but certain landing-boat men with special glasses . Landing parties heading in one direction were to pass this boat on the portside ; landing parties heading in another were to go around it and enter the harbor itself . The men did n't talk much at first . They crouched down behind the armored ramp of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten minutes I could hear one of them begin to say something about his girl . It was eleven P.M. back in New York , and he knew it . " It 's a hell of a thing , " he muttered . " She always goes to the late shows Saturday nights , and that 's where she is right now , looking at Victor Mature . " " And Four-F Charley 's probably with her , " a pal consoled him . American Armada Somebody else said , " I wonder will this be in the Sunday papers back home ? Mom 'll be so scared , I 'll bet she wo n't start yellin ' at pop for not gettin ' up till maybe eleven-twelve o'clock . " The coxswain next to me grinned . " That 's a fact , " he agreed . " I sure wish I could see the folks ' faces when this news gets out . " I remember thinking about the captain 's talk to the ship 's officers when he had called us into the wardroom to tell us where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , and when he spoke he meant exactly what he said . " This is big , " he had told us . " It 's the biggest sea-borne invasion in the history of the world . The Spanish Armada was piker stuff compared to us . It must not fail . If it does , we 'll never he able to answer to the American people or to our own consciences . " He had almost finished talking when he added something I do n't imagine any of us will ever forget . We were all a little uneasy and a little scared . " We are the most privileged group of men in the world , " he said . " Of all the fighting units that could have been sent into this thing , we have been picked . It is a great privilege , gentlemen . " It took a while for that to sink in . As we got close to shore we could see more and more lights burning . So far , so good . They had n't spotted us . An amphibious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Surprise is its most valuable asset . To achieve this successfully , all elements must work with split-second timing and coordination . Ships , planes , assault boats , guns and men must function as a single smashing unit . But even with all the care and planning in the world , a touch of luck one way or the other can make or break the venture . We had strict orders not to fire until we were fired upon . French resistance was still an unknown quantity , and it was hoped that we would be able to move in without a fight . Great care had been taken to fit each landing boat with an American flag and each soldier with an oilcloth armband on which the flag had been lithographed . Still , as we drew close to the beach , every man flicked the safety catch off his gun . We were n't discovered until the destroyers were entering the harbor . Then a rickety old French tug named the Alphonse DeLande opened up with small-arm fire . 80 THE SATURDAY EVENINGEVENI NG POST January 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyer radioed hack to the task-force commander . " Batter up ? " he queried . " Play ball , " replied the commander . The show was on . Both destroyers opened up with 3-inch guns , sinking the Alphonse DeLande in shallow water in a very few seconds . After the action was over I talked to a soldier who had been below decks on one destroyer during that firing . He said he felt exactly like a mouse inside a bass drum . Those 3-inch guns woke up the town . In the next few minutes all hell seemed to break loose . French Foreign Legionnaires and native Moroccan troops jumped into artillery and machine-gun emplacements with incredible speed . They began to shoot at us from the hills and cliffs overhanging the town , from nests all around the harbor and from a long stone jetty which protected the harbor on its western side . In the dark , every tracer you see seems to be going right clown your throat . Not anybody else 's throat . Just yours . It 's an optical illusion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it at one time or another . You ca n't remember much of what happens . Little things stick out sharply here and there , though ; things that you probably never will forget . There was one Frenchman who had to run about 250 yards to get to his post at the edge of the jetty . As he ran , somebody on one of the destroyers was working over him with a machine gun . The bursts landed just behind him , not more than five or ten feet away . Each time , he 'd hitch up his pants , bend over a little farther and jump like a rabbit . It looked like a Disney cartoon . At night , all shells look red-hot . I knew Navy gunners were plenty good , but , until I saw them in that first action , I never realized just how good . Shells kept pouring out of the destroyers ' guns so fast that they looked like solid lines of tracers . Long before one shell had hit its objective , two or three others were on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a crisscross of fire from the shore batteries and the heavy guns of the warships , taking offhand shots at each other in the dark . Now and then a star shell would flare up over the harbor , flooding destroyers , landing boats and men with bright silver light . It made the American flags on our boats stand out prominently and had the unreal theatrical quality of a Fourth of July stage show at the Radio City Music Hall . I do n't remember hearing a sound . After the first minute it was like a silent movie . The Dark Continent The destroyers and the first wave of landing boats hit the four beaches simultaneously . One destroyer , whose objective was Green Beach , deliberately ran alongside the rocks . Almost before it stopped moving , its troops were overboard and rushing toward their objective  --  three huge oil tanks back of the town . The men had orders to capture these and hold them intact . They did . The other destroyer , in a beautiful piece of seamanship , came up alongside a concrete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artillery fire . Its troops were to capture the dock and a set of gasoline-electric cranes which would be useful to us later , in unload-nloading . They captured the dock all right , but the night watchman managed to sabotage the cranes before they got there . Next day , when the fighting had slowed down , that same watchman , all bows and smiles , came back to the dock and politely offered to fix the cranes . In about three hours he had them working perfectly . As soon as the first wave of troops from the landing boats were put on the beaches , they started right after their objectives . One group had to go in jeeps and light tanks to capture an airfield some twenty kilometers outside the town . Another combat team , which landed at Red Beach , carried ropes and ladders to scale a cliff rising up about 100 yards back of the sand . They climbed up there and knocked out a machine-gun position with grenades before the French even knew they were ashore . The second wave of boats got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to go in for their landing , all harbor defenses were firing as fast as they could aim and reload . From the hills back of the town and from an ancient Portuguese fortress with stone walls three feet thick , French 75 's poured a rain of shrapnel into the water and onto the beaches . It was still too early for our planes to go up , so we just had to take it . The big ships supporting us did what they could . But without accurate fire control , they could n't be too effective . As our third wave went in , shells from both sides continued to scream overhead . The flash when they leave a gun is lemon yellow . The projectiles themselves travel in a tremendously high arc , moving lazily . When a salvo is fired , the shells look like a team of red-hot horses running through the sky , gradually growing fainter in color as they approach their target . We landed our men without incident and backed off Green Beach to return to the transports for more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing that always worried me was the thirty or forty seconds when our boat would be broadside to the shore defenses . That is , we could retract from the beach and out into deep water all right . But eventually we had to come about , and it was that turn I did n't like . When the time came to make it , I never thought about it . There were plenty of machine-gun bullets that seemed to have my name on them when we were headed toward the shore in our narrowest silhouette . Being broadside did n't seem to change the number one little bit . At dawn , the main bout between the coast defenses and the warships started . In the darkness , their gunnery had been by guess . Now , with improved visibility , they went at it in earnest . At the height of the action a big battle wagon moved up close to get at one troublesome outfit . I 'd never seen a dreadnought at work before and did n't know how graceful they really are . The Guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the cliff where she 'd located her victims , just like a fine Percheron on exhibition at a horse show . She turned and pirouetted , firing constantly as she came about , For all her great size , her movements were amazingly precise and dainty , like those of a ballet dancer  --  if such a simile is logical . On shore , as more and more of our troops and equipment were landed , excitement ran high for a while . Resistance by the French was proving unexpectedly fierce . There was a great deal of house-to-house fighting , and hidden gun batteries constantly came to life in places where they were least expected . Jeeps raced up and down the streets and along the cliff roads , ferreting out the French artillery positions . They silenced them with machine-gun and mortar fire whenever possible , and radioed the exact location to the naval guns offshore when it was not . One by one , as the morning progressed , those 75 's went out of action . In the center of town , a somewhat different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legionnaires were holed up in a stone barracks , successfully defending themselves against all the light tank and mortar fire we could bring into action . It looked like a stalemate until our heavier equipment came ashore , but no one worried very much . Time was on our side . Safi 's four beaches teemed with activity as wave after wave of landing boats continued to pile up reinforcements from the transports . On the whole , this naval side of things went very well . We did lose some boats and men through gunfire ; though not nearly as many as had been expected . On our second trip to the beach , my own boat had been knocked out by the blast of a 76 shell . The troops were off and away when we were hit , and I can remember looking dazedly at the shattered bow and then at the crew and saying , " Well , I guess this is where we get off . " We left the boat there on the beach and fitted ourselves into other landing boats where men had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the French . On Yellow Beach , where the surf ran from ten to fifteen feet high , some of our boats broached to  --  that is , they turned sideways when landing  --  were thrown up on the beach and filled with water . The men were able to get ashore , but the boats were useless . Later , Navy mechanics stripped them of all usable material and blew up the hulls . Very little is wasted in this war . It was rainy and gray until about ten o'clock in the morning . Just as we landed the last troops from the transports , planes started to take off from the decks of the carriers . Shortly before this , three French bombers had come over the harbor , but had been driven off by ack-ack fire from our ships . Now our fliers were out to knock off those planes and their home airfield . When they returned , some time later , French antiaircraft guns began firing and managed to hit one plane . The crew parachuted to safety on land , and later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention , I talked to the gunner . He 'd been hit in the leg by a piece of shrapnel , but his main gripe was that there had still been fifty rounds of ammunition left in his machine guns . The other Navy pilots were out for revenge . On the next trip back to Green Beach , I noticed about ten planes circling over the spot where our dive bomber had been shot down . They 'd swoop low and then spiral slowly up , daring the antiaircraft gunners to fire . But the Frenchmen were n't having any . They realized those dive bombers did n't know just where they were . If they fired on a plane now , the others would be in to plaster them before the smoke of the first shell had cleared away . That ack-ack crew , having proved it could hit something , promptly lost interest in the war . When our jeeps finally located them , the men were calmly playing bezique and waiting to surrender . Shortly before noon , most heavy-gun resistance having been overcome , our task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now came the really big job  --  unloading supplies and equipment for the Army . 1 Gasoline , in five-gallon drums , and ammunition were the A priorities . Then came food ; most of it , for the first day or two , in packaged field rations . The largest part of our tank force was preparing to start up the coast toward Casablanca , where , we 'd heard , the fighting was severe . It took a lot of landings to stock them up . We soon got the unloading down to a system . Aboard the transport they 'd fill a cargo net with supplies , pucker it together like a woman 's drawstring handbag , and hook the ends onto a cargo boom . We 'd come alongside and they 'd lower a netful right into the boat . We 'd unhook all but one end of the net , signal the winchman to start rolling , and up would go the net with a jerk . Of course , the gas cans and ammunition boxes flew around inside the cockpit . But they never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that strange magic called timing , and either you have it or you have n't . Beurling has it , plus the approach of a scientific perfectionist to his trade . His squadron leader in Malta calls him " the perfect mathematician of the air , " going on from there to discuss the precision of the deflection-shooting by means of which the young man bagged most of his kill . That means timing your burst to arrive at a given point at the precise moment when the enemy reaches it , and it is a matter of spit second reckoning relating to two planes , yours and 11 the victim 's , which will be miles apart a minute later if you miss . " People keep asking me what my system is , " Beurling says . " It 's a matter of training your eyes to focus and the system was fast . I do n't believe it would comply with Navy regulations . But the Army was in a hurry . And speed was what we gave them . I do n't remember eating that first day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because we kept going for nearly forty-three hours without sleep . On later trips to the transport they lowered lard pails full of coffee to us . That helped a lot . Not being able to smoke was the hardest part of the whole job . I stood it until about three o'clock on Sunday afternoon . Then I had to have a cigarette . So , when we got the boat unloaded , I took the men with me and walked far enough up the beach to be safely away from the ammunition . Presently , we were joined by one Ensign R. W. Hunter . We all liked Hunter , but no one was very glad to see him just then . He stands six feet four in his stocking feet  --  a sniper 's dream come true . We lit up , and nothing ever tasted so good as those first few puffs . They were almost our last though . Just then , snipers back of the town spotted Hunter and could n't resist the temptation to get nasty . It was too far back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began digging fox holes . The sand was soft and fine , like Coney Island sand , and in practically nothing flat , we were comfortably below ground . We lay there about two hours . There was plenty of time to smoke our fill and to curse Hunter . After about an hour , during a short lull , an Army private came scrambling across the beach like a crab . He came alongside my fox hole , dug one for himself and bummed a cigarette . Pretty soon the snipers started up again . They were hiding behind gravestones in a cemetery up on the hill . We just lay there slapping at sand fleas , scratching and wondering how long it was going to take our tanks to deal with those snipers . " You know , " the Army man said thoughtfully , " until this afternoon , I 've always kinda liked graveyards .
