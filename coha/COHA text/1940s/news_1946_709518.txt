But it also enumerated the main obstacles against such a European union : first , the potential danger of 400 millions of united Europeans ; second , the danger that Germany might again attempt to dominate the Continent ; third , Russia 's obvious opposition . Discussing these three serious obstacles one by one , the first seems the least dangerous , because even in our grandchildren 's lifetime Europe 's unity will not be solid enough to back a policy of aggression . The hatreds between Europe 's nations are so deep that nobody can expect them to vanish within less than a century . The second obstacle , the danger of German predominance , is far more realistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ republican or monarchist , democratic or communist , would seek to overthrow the status of Europe either by war or by revolution . Disarmament is no sufficient protection , because Germany could be quickly rearmed by a powerful ally . None of Germany 's neighbors would be willing to join a European federation around a Fourth Reich , They remember that Germany was the nightmare of Europe ever since Prince Bismarck united the Reich that eventually provoked World War I. They have not forgotten that its successor , the peaceful and democratic Republic of Weimar , became the cradle of Hitlerism , while the Third Reich almost destroyed our entire civilization by World War II . A Fourth Reich would be treated by its neighbors as a kind of European ghetto , out of fear that it might resume the policy of its predecessors . This would mean a precarious European truce , not a European peace . Asset to Civilization We must not forget that the German people were , before Bismarck , an asset to Western civilization ; that it took many centuries to unite the German states ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but under the threat and pressure of Prussia 's armies that forced Germany 's minor states into submission and union . The re-establishment of German states , under the control of a United Europe , would quickly create new vested interests and new local patriotisms , opposed to pan-Germanism and to Prussian militarism . The new states would soon become jealous of their independence and equality and seek Europe 's help against the danger of any revival of Prussian hegemony . A European federation would rapidly gain the loyal support of the German states and of most of the German people , because it would grant them peace , prosperity and liberty , after pan-Germanism had led them twice in our generation to war and ruin and finally to slavery . The most serious obstacle for European union is at present Russia 's opposition . The Soviets are fully aware that all states of a disunited Europe would be at the mercy of their gigantic neighbor . Thus a disunited Europe obviously paves the way to a Soviet Europe . But , on the other hand , America is vitally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create a centralized power stretching from the coast opposite Alaska across the Old World to the Azores and Iceland , thus encircling America in the east and west . But even if America and Russia should not agree on the European question , the last word on this issue would be spoken by the people of Europe themselves . Present Partition Opposed All these nations are strongly opposed to the present partition of their continent into spheres of influence . They fully realize that this partition leads to a new World War , accompanied by civil wars throughout Europe . They know that it is neither in their interest to antagonize their powerful Russian neighbor nor to surrender to him . That there is place enough within the United Nations organization for a European union living peacefully side by side with the Soviet Union ? as friendly neighbors , without mutual Ithreats or fears of invasion . And they are more than ever inclined to back Winston Churchill 's grand vision of a united Europe , more peaceful and more prosperous than ever since the days of the Roman Empire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentence of his successor , Clement Attlee : " Europe must federate or perish ! " RICHARD COTMENHOVE-KALERGI , , President of the Pan European Union . New York , May 20 , 1946 . Paviatm ' Plans for Nevi Buildings TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The parking problem in the city is so bad that something must be done . Streets can not be widened , more and more crosstown express streets are appearing and there is very little space left for legitimate parking . There seems to be no place else to put cars except underground . I therefore believe that all new buildings should have an underground parking area . Office buildings , apartment houses , department stores , theatres , etc. , would be taking a great step toward modernizing our city if they would plan a parking space or garage ) in the basement from the start . Designers of new buildings should take heed . Cars and trucks coming out of a building should not come into the street at a 90-degree angle , as in the few existing underground garages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into traffic without any interruption of the cross traffic , just as they would flow out of it in the same way . RITA SINGSTAD GARDINER . New York , May 27 , 1946 . High Duty Protested British and Russian Recipients of Relief Packages Seen Penalized To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Several articles recently have appeared on the subject of the overseas gift racket . While gifts sent directly from Americans to friends in Britain do not come within that classification , would-be donors here should know what happens to their gifts . The average duty on food parcels is 10 to 15 per cent , on shoes 20 per cent , on rayon 43 1-3 per cent , and on furs 30 per cent . On tobacco it runs as high as 800 to 1,200 per cent . That is only the beginning . The " purchase tax " is chargeable on these gifts , although , obviously , there is no purchase . This ranges from 16 2/3 per cent on shoes to 100 per cent on all luxury articles , such as furs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recipient is the giving up of ration coupons , which already are at such a pitifully low level as to be a real problem . In view of the serious shortages existing in Britain , one would think that gifts would be officially welcomed and all obstacles at least temporarily suspended . In all cases each American donor should find out in advance what gifts his British friends can afford to accept . ALBANNACH . Paterson , N. J. , May 26 , 1946 . Exaggerated Charges To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : May I call your attention to a situation with ' Which many Americans of Russian extraction are deeply concerned . Many of us are sending parcels to our relatives in the U.S.S.R. As everybody knows , the Russian people need clothing , shoes and food desperately . A regular eleven-pound package consisting only of food costs approximately from five to seven dollars , postage included . The recipient of the package is obliged to pay from 80 to 120 rubles duty on it . At the official rate of exchange this amounts to $16 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation becomes really scandalous . As city editor of the oldest Russian daily in the United States , Novoye Russkoye Slovo , I have received many letters informing me that a parcel containing , for example , four old dresses and a pair of used shoes was taxed 2,000 rubles$400 ? by Russian customs authorities . Sometimes the recipients simply refuse this " gift , " as they are unable to pay the duty . Unfortunately , at times they accept the package , hoping to find in it some valuable articles , only to be painfully disillusioned . Furthermore , the duty can be paid here in New York City at the only organization which has a special Soviet license . Here the sender is the victim of a very exaggerated service charge and the duty is calculated in the following manner : For example , a man 's suit , which was $40 when new , costs $32 for just the duty . And the suit is now old . Add to this the expense for service , many times as much as is permitted by OPA , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war all of us helped Russian people through the Russian War Relief . The time has come now to help our own relatives in Russia . We can not do this without being ruined ourselves or bringing our relatives to poverty . ANDREI SEDYC H. New York , May 21 , 1946 . Veterans ' Seniority To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your recent comment on the Supreme Court decision in regard to veterans ' seniority states that " the Court rules that Congress conferred no right to seniority beyond that held by the veteran at the time of his induction , " and further , that " the Court decides that the veteran can step on the ' seniority escalator ' only where he stepped off . " I believe that both these statements give a misleading impression of the actual ruling of the Court . ARTHUR SMITH , New York , May 29 , 1946 . Mr. Smith is correct in believing that the two phrases to which he refers could have been better stated . When we said " the Court rules that Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veteran at the time of his induction , " we meant , as the balance of the same sentence in our editorial makes clear , that " he is not entitled to displace a non-veteran of higher seniority . " He does , of course , gain the right to hold the same place in the seniority , line which he held before . Similarly , in our statement that he steps back on the " seniority escalator " only where he stepped off , we meant that he displaced no one who was previously ahead of him . He is , of course , entitled to seniority credit for the time spent in service , and , as our editorial went on to say , to " return . without loss of seniority to his old position or a position of like seniority .
