txt Tunnel Sign Inadequate Oh , for a sign ! After reading advertisements of the time saving possible in using the Queens tunnel I tried it one night . True , I saved minutes that would have been lost in crossing over the Fifty-ninth Street Bridge from Manhattan . But the gain was canceled by the time I spent on the Queens side trying to find Queens Boulevard . Maps indicated a direct connection . from the exit . I followed the road , peering into the darkness for a guide sign . The first traffic cop I met  --  Broadway , Flushing , and do n't ask me how I got there  --  sent me back in the direction I had come , but he could not tell me where my turn-off was located . Later I made the same trip in daylight , and found a small sign indicating the turn-off to Queens Boulevard right at the road entrance . Any one traveling thirty-five miles an hour will pass the turn-off by the time he reads the sign . Why not place a warning  --  visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? DISGUSTED MOTORIST .
