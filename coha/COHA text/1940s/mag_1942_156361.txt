From a Russian correspondent of the London Times last week came this typically Russian account of scorched-earth tactics in the Cossack country . <P> It is a sultry , stifling day . A burning haze hovers over the dusty street of the stanitsa Cossack village of Starominskaya . Usually deserted at this hour , Starominskaya is filled with unaccustomed activity . Windows , doors and gates of all the cottages are flung wide open , and in each courtyard stands a wagon to which a pair of sturdy horses is harnessed . Villagers take only the most essential belongings ; the rest will be buried under cover of darkness where the invaders will never discover it . The cattle were driven away several days ago . All that is left is the poultry , which the children are now chasing in the courtyards , while their mother , tears streaming down her cheeks , cuts the throats of cocks and hens , bitterly cursing the cause of it all . As the column leaves , the night sky is illuminated by the glare of burning villages and gunfire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , mothers and small children , the sick and crippled . The able-bodied will remain behind and fight side by side with the Red Army troops . <P> An old Cossack took up his ax and called his 13-year-old grandson from a neighboring house : " Come here , grandson , and let us cut down the orchard and smash the beehives . " Apple , pear and apricot trees laden with still unripe fruit fell one after another . " Pile it up in the street , " the old man said . " Let anybody who wants take it , and what is left the armored tractors will crush to pulp when they come by . " <P> Tonight Red troops poured through en route to the front . The old man and all other Cossack cottagers retired , planning how nothing must be left for the enemy except a scorched waste . Such is the decision of the Kuban Cossacks , the glorious descendants of the Cossacks of Zaporozhye Sech , who also burned and destroyed everything . <P> Later in the quiet village the sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their huts , hastily arming themselves with shotguns , sabers , axes and even fire irons , and ran toward an assembly point . Scattering among the yards and orchards , concealing themselves behind fences and in ditches , they spied out the position of the enemy force and prepared to fall upon it . A report was dispatched to the commander of the nearest Red Army unit . " Kill wherever you can and any way you can , " he ordered through quick-footed youngsters , and the Cossacks began operations . A German coming to a well for a drink was shot . Another got a brick on his skull when he went into an orchard without a helmet . <P> " Mama , there are two Germans in our pigsty ; they are breaking down the wall looking onto the street , " cried a 13-year-old boy to his mother . The Cossack woman 's husband had been killed at Rostov . She cautiously drew from under the floor an old scimitar wrapped in rags , drew it from its scabbard , tried its edge and resolutely made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood crouching by the door awaiting a signal from her son . The boy squeaked softly like a mouse .
