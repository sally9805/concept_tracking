After almost a year of trying , the Surplus War Property Administration admitted this week that the Government had managed to sell the U.S. public only 6,912 of its 27,253 used aircraft . <P> Best sellers : 1 ) the feathery , civilian-type Piper Cub ( used for pilot training ) ; 2 ) the puddle-jumping Taylorcrafts , Fairchilds , Aeroncas and Ryans ( used for screening cadets and artillery observation ) . No sale : advanced trainers , multi-motored bombers , fighters . Reasons : suci craft are too expensive , some are altogether too " hot " for the average civilian pilot . <P> Despite its weak sales approach , SWPA succeeded admirably in discounting two popular myths : <P> Viewers-with-alarm feared that many surplus war products might glut the post-war market , now realize they may be as hard to sell as a shot-up dive bomber . <P> Surplus bombers , which the British feared would be used by the U.S. to dominate world air-cargo routes , are already being turned down by airlines as too expensive to convert and operate .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
