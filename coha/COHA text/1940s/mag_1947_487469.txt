A NEWS.FLASH FROM LONDON ANNOUNCES , as we go to press , that the Council of Foreign Ministers has adjourned indefinitely . Thus , what may prove to be the last effort of the Big Four to write a joint peace treaty with Germany has ended in abject failure . Total disagreement on the reparations question seems to have been the immediate cause , but there was no meeting of minds on any point of importance . Nor , perhaps , could any have been expected , considering the tense state of mutual suspicion between Russia and the United States . With no armistice in sight to halt the " cold war , " the contest will now be transferred from the council chamber to other fields , with capture of the political support and economic potential of Germany the immediate objective of both sides . We shall comment at length next week on the causes and consequences of this sorry ending of a once great alliance . COMMUNIST ECONOMY IS NO MORE IMMUNE to the ravages of inflation than a capitalist or semi-Socialist one . In Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to a vast increase in the supply of money in relation to the supply of goods . The result was " an inflationary gap " which the Soviet government now proposes to close by drastic devaluation . Holders of cash will receive only one new ruble for ten old ones . Owners of state bonds are treated better : they will exchange their securities on a one-for-three basis . Bank depositors , who will receive one for one on the first three thousand rubles , do best of all . The chief concern of most Soviet workers will probably be the actual buying power of their incomes . Since wages , pensions , and so forth are to remain unchanged , real incomes will depend on the new unified price schedules . In the absence of more data than are at present available , it is hard to say just how the various classes will fare ; those whose incomes have been sufficient to buy only what their ration cards entitled them to may be rather worse off . Bread will cost them a little less ; meat , fats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more . And with rationing ended , they will be able to buy as much as they can afford . On the other hand , tea , milk , fruits , textiles , and shoes  --  previously rationed  --  are to be priced above the ration level though well under that prevailing in the " commercial stores . " Those who hitherto have earned enough to enable them to patronize the commercial stores may find the buying power of their incomes enhanced but that of their savings diminished . On the whole , we doubt whether devaluation will greatly alter the distribution of goods in Russia . EVERY DELAY AND SIGN OF HESITATION among the major powers or in the United Nations stimulate violence in Palestine and encourage the still vacillating members of the Arab League to accept the dictates of the Mufti and his fellow-firebrands . Yet nothing has happened in these past two weeks to convince the Arabs that the decision of the U. N. Assembly was a serious business , to be carried out firmly and with energy . The five-nation Palestine Commission has not even been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Czechoslovakia ; and he has sailed for home . The somnolent tempo at Lake Success possibly reflects American as well as British reluctance to take the necessary next steps . In any case , that reluctance is not to be questioned ; the Bevin attitude has an exact echo in certain corners of the State Department . On page 675 , we publish a detailed record of the Palestine fight in the U. N. The story , which even now can be told only in part , reveals plainly the cross-currents of interest in Washington which all but immobilized the American delegation at the Assembly . The same situation , if it continues , will block effective American help in implementing partition and enabling Palestine 's Jews to defend the security of their newly promised land . AS FOR BRITAIN , ITS BEHAVIOR , BOTH IN Palestine and at home , has been such as to guarantee increasing Arab violence . Although troops were finally moved into one or two areas where tension was greatest , the British authorities have largely held aloof . Still worse , the murderous assault on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legion ? Transjordan 's British-led army  --  shows that even the forces ostensibly charged with keeping order are not to be relied on . Attacks have multiplied on both sides , with the Irgun staging reprisals that would certainly have been avoided had the British given Haganah authority to maintain order . As it is , extremists are gaining ground , creating a situation that will make the work of the commission , when it ultimately takes over , almost hopelessly difficult . But Britain 's folded-arms attitude in Palestine is by no means its 664 The NATION only form of obstruction . The government has announced that although it will probably lay down the mandate by May 15 , the U. N. Commission will not be received in Palestine until two weeks before that date . Two weeks to reestablish order , set up organs of government , and form and arm militias to mountain order with- . out any further help from the British forces ! This explicit formula for failure , following the behavior of Britain in the U. N. and its record since then in Palestine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the breakdown of partition , before it has even a chance to get under way . In spite of the dilatory and divided temper of the State Department , we are sure neither the President nor Secretary Marshall would welcome such an outcome . We call upon them , most urgently , to take the necessary steps to prevent it . BEYOND THE POINT OF ? BEING SURPRISED AT anything John L. Lewis might do , we nevertheless read no fanciful significance into his contemptuous two-word message of " disaffiliation " from the American Federation of Labor . Inevitably , rumors are to be had for the picking : Lewis will make his peace with Phil Murray and return to the C. I. O. ; Lewis will go raiding and build his District 50 into a third major labor organization ; Lewis will revive his Labor 's Non-Partisan League and cast in his political lot with Henry Wallace . Any of them could be true , but none need be . The mine leader has always been a labor statesman of the rule-or-ruin persuasion , and after what happened at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't pay him or his miners to stay in . It would have meant contributing $216,000 a year to the Federation treasury in dues and another $600,000 to Labor 's Education and Political League in the form of a voluntary donation  --  all without a representative on the Executive Council . At sixty-seven , and far from well , it is unlikely that Lewis will Make rnuch of a splash either politically or as a contender for labor leadership . Even assuming that he could dispose of the miners ' vote  --  which he failed to do , in the past  --  where could he throw it ? As for the potentialities of District 50 , he has lavished time and money on that catch-all for some years without achieving more than a total membership of 75,000 . Lewis may have walked out of the spotlight this time . THE BROOKLYN TABLET AND THE NEW YORK World-Telegram have scored a disturbing victory for bigotry . For many years , New York school teachers have obtained " alertness " credits toward pay increases by taking approved lecture courses in various city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Board of Superintendents last week dropped from its approved list one lecturer and one course and ordered the suspension of a second course pending its a. , ' ecormer 13 , 1947 " reorganization . " The excommunicated lecturer is Dr. Bernhard J. Stern , Columbia University sociologist , and the course is " The Soviet Union , Its Economic and Cultural Development , " given by the American-Russian Institute . The suspended course is " Backgrounds and Techniques in Teaching Intercultural Education , " sponsored ' by a group of teachers ' societies , which are subject to the authority of the Board of Superintendents , as the institute is not . The Tablet and the World-Telegram objected to Dr. Stern , an acknowledged authority on race relations , because of his leftist connections and his authorship , seventeen years ago , of a pamphlet attacking the three major American religions . The Tablet also objected to the intercultural education course on the ground that six of its lectures were to deal with racial prejudice  --  proof positive , naturally , that Communists were at work . As we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not replied to the Board of Superintendents ' order . We hope that , when they do , the board will reverse its decision . An adult 's freedom to hear the speakers he chooses , as well as to earn much-needed credits , should not be cut to fit the cloth of the Tablet and the World-Telegram . THE UNITED NATIONS CERTAINLY GETS around . The Human Rights Commission has now been requested to do something about a king of the Bekom tribes , in the British Cameroons , who collects wives . The St. Joan 's Social and Political Alliance of London has put the matter squarely up to the commission in a petition documented with a story which is so vivid that we are surprised to find that it was the work of a Franciscan missionary . It seems that this old gentleman , the king  --  he is eighty  --  sends out scouts to the tribal huts to select young and comely candidates . The girls , with " nothing on but a necklace of large seeds , " are brought , one by one , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leopard under his feet . The girl 's father throws his daughter to the ground , the king steps forward and places his right foot upon her , and another wife is added to his collection of some six hundred . During the ceremony , a hundred of these wives " stand around him in a semi-circle  --  naked -- as is the privilege and custom of the ling 's own ' . " Needless to say , we expect the Human Rights Commission to do its duty  --  and we should like to be on hand when its representative , clothed , of course , with full powers , explains to a king who uses a live leopard for a footstool - why he should n't collect wives . COMMENTING LAST WEEK ON THE FIRING of ten Hollywood writers for refusing to tell the Un-American Committee whether or not they were Communists , we remarked that " anti-communism is a one-way 665 through street " and that " once you enter it you either proceed to the end or you back out -- quickly . " Several readers have chosen to interpret this remark as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , to the red-baiting procedures of the Thomas committee and the Hollywood producers who did the firing . There is also an anti-communism , obviously , that has nothing in common with hysteria or the denial of civil rights , and from this kind of opposition the Communists are entitled to no more exemption than any other political group . Confusion Confounded I IS now a month since the President opened the 1 special session of Congress with a message asking for drastic powers to combat inflation . During these weeks , . prices have continued to rise rapidly . Butter is again almost 431 a pound ; eggs are hitting $1 a dozen . Quotations for industrial goods have been moving upward even more rapidly than those of farm products . In the past few-days , sharp increases have been announced for tinplate , farm machinery , some automobiles , rayon yarn , and petroleum products . This steady erosion of the purchasing power of the dollar should have served as a goad to government action . Yet , in the past month , no visible-progress has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both the Administration and the Congress share the blame . Mr. Truman 's ten points provided the working basis for a legislative program , but he has failed to sell his ideas to his own subordinates , not to mention Congress . We have had the unedifying spectacle of Cabinet officers ? Anderson and Harriman for example  --  appearing before Congressional committees to damn the President 's proposals , with faint praise and to plug their individual policies . On the all-important question of checking credit inflation , discussed by Keith Hutchison in detail on page 681 , Secretary of the Treasury Snyder and Chairman Eccles of the Federal Reserve Board , men on whom Mr. Truman must rely for guidance in this field , have been publicly at loggerheads . If the Republican majority in Congress had even a modicum of courage and wisdom , it would have seized the opportunity afforded by these divisions in the Administration to come forward with a really effective program of its own . But it , too , is split . Some of the younger members of the party realize that the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The concern of their leaders , however , has been to reap maximum political benefits with minimum disturbance of the boom that is filling the coffers of their supporters . They have issued a program that pays some homage to the principle of control , but in general approaches the subject in a 666 vague and ultra-cautious manner . A very small part of this program has been embodied in a bill which merely authorizes government encouragement of voluntary agreements for the allocation of transport and of commodities in short supply . To make way for this feeble measure , they have thrust aside an Administration bill providing broad powers to ration food and other scarce goods and to establish priorities for key raw materials . To encourage business cooperation , the bill proposes , for a limited period , to relieve parties to any agreement approved by the President from the operation of the antitrust laws . This seems to us a highly dangerous proposal . In the case of industries in which supply is beginning to catch up with demand. , protected voluntary agreements may prove popular , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring them down . And in those industries whose production will for a long time remain unequal to demand , an agreement to stabilize prices or to equalize distribution can easily be thwarted by a few holdouts , for the bill fails to provide any powers of enforcement . Let us consider , for instance , the current situation in oil . Some of the larger concerns have ' been trying to check the steady rise in prices , which they realize can do little to encourage higher production and much to give the industry a black eye with the public . They have been stymied by the competitive scramble for crude oil . Few of the big refiners have sufficient crude supplies of their own to insure capacity operation of their plants , and if one concern raises its buying price , the others must sooner or later follow suit or find themselves unable to fill orders . The latest attempt at stabilization was killed recently when Sun Oil ( controlled by Pennsylvania 's G. 0 . P. boss , J. Howard Pew ) raised its buying price for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which compares with $1.27 when the OPA ended . The real trouble in oil is that with a steadily , rising demand for fuel oils there is not enough to go round . This has nothing to do with exports , since we are actually importing more oil than we ship . Voluntary allocations will not remedy the situation , for a few chiselers can render any agreement ineffective . If serious shortages in many areas , causing widespread suffering , are to be avoided this winter , enforceable price control and rationing measures are essential . And as even Senator Taft is beginning to discover , rationing of meat will be equally essential next spring when supplies will be far shorter than they are now . The G. 0 . P. bill does not begin to grapple with such problems ; its only purpose seems to be to mislead and confuse the voters . It is almost certain to be vetoed , if it passes Congress , for Mr. Truman has sharply condemned relaxation of the anti-trust laws . ( Unfortunately , his position on this subject has been compromised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - The NATIONI ciple embodied in the bill . ) Possibly , the Republicans not only expect but want a veto , with the idea that they could wash their hands of further responsibility for inflation . If that is their strategy  --  we hope the President counters it by sticking firmly to his program . But he will have to start by insisting that his department heads support his line instead of adopting conflicting positions of their own . The spectacle of the Cabinet at sixes and sevens is the most confounding of all the present confusions in Washington . What Are We Afraid Of ? BY FREDA KIRCHWEY I SIT and ponder the fever over Communists and civil rights , the polite debate between the New York Herald Tribune and the leader of the E. B. White Party , the list of " subversive " organizations put out by the Justice Department , the Ernst-Hays dispute about " disclosure " as a preventive for subversion . I recall 19191920 ; more , I turn the pages of the Nation volumes for those years and try to fathom the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wars . What in the name of Thomas Jefferson are we scared of ? The raids under A. Mitchell Palmer , the ousting of duly elected Socialists from the New York Legislature , the unceremonious mass deportations of alien " reds "  - -  what did they signify ? Today , it is Communists that are thrown out of government jobs along with any others stamped as dangerous under the convenient and ugly theory of association . Today , there are not many aliens to ship abroad ; the supply , owing to our tight immigration laws and fine screening , is short . But we grab those few who escaped the Nazis with left views and questionable papers , or who lied to save their lives , and convert usually quite harmless fugitives into criminal enemies of the state . Can the fever to hunt heretics be laid to Moscow ? Does it come from fear of imminent war ? Does it come from a belief that this country  --  undamaged , over-flowing with goods , powerful beyond the dreams of any world conqueror  --  is in the danger of a Communist-led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bluster and attempts to girdle its borders with safe satellite states , no one really believes the Soviet government could start , or successfully wage , a war . In the whole world , only the United States is capable of doing that . Nor do sane Americans seriously anticipate revolution . Our one visible , quite present danger is a new Harding era , with labor driven into division and bankruptcy and radicals chivvied underground and liberals organized  --  like . E. B. White  --  in " parties of one , " ready to be swallowed in comfortable mouthfuls by those gentlemen we have so trustfully encouraged to save us from the reds . If the present hysteria is at all related to such fears , it is more as a general reaction to Russian provocations and refusal to cooperate in the ordinary business of international relations . ( Quite naturally , we minimize , or even forget , our own less spectacular exhibitions . of non-cooperation , such as Mr. Collins mentions on page 669 . ) We boil with anger at evidence of red injustice in Bulgaria or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then easily transfer our emotion to the meager if irritating displays made by our few native Communists . But why is our boiling-point so low , and why have we so little confidence in our own democratic stability ? As Harold Laski said in his impressive article last week , " Powerful America does not appear to be a happy America . " Some psychosis of guilt or dread , unrelated to our apparent national health or to the actual threats we face , must account for the terrible urge to mutilate our institutions in order to save them . T HINK back to 1919 . Some say that our " danger " is greater today than then because Russia is a mighty military power  --  even minus the bomb  --  and the world Communist movement is its instrument of penetration and intimidation . I would dispute this argument . In 1919 and 1920 , the Red Army was weak by 1947 standards . But the revolution was young and its ideas were potent and uncompromised . Then , as now , hungry workers without jobs rose against the system they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a Soviet government and so did Hungary . ( Belfast , too ! ) The Italian workers seized the factories in the north . The French Socialists split , but the majority section joined the Third International , as did the Spanish and Norwegian Socialists . The flood of revolution moved across Europe and menaced , much more immediately than today , the old states of Central and Western Europe . It broke then , as it may break tomorrow , against Western capitalist power reinforced by grants-in-aid from America . The old gang got back . American capital bailed out Germany . Russia 's fierce resistance was smashed by Allied intervention and Allied backing for White generals . Poland and the Baltic provinces were financed-and armed solely to fight the Soviets . Horthy was tricked into power by Britain ; Mussolini , a little later , took over in Italy . The Munich Soviet government collapsed in the blood of its great leader , Kurt Eisner ; Luxemburg and Liebknecht were assassinated ; and the Socialist Noske shot down Communist workers in Berlin . Whatever democratic vagaries Mr. Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with by Clemenceau and Lloid George . But though reaction triumphed , the system that bred it never recovered . ? It was shattered ' by war ; weakened by the fall of empires and territorial changes . The , great European middle class lost much of its vitality through physical depletion and inflation . Capitalism pulled itself together again , but it was a shell of its old self  --  and the end of social revolution only marked the ' beginning of fascism . - Then , as now , and with as much reason , the United States rushed food to Europe to save lives and regimes . We intervened to crush revolution . And , even more frantically , we kicked democratic safeguards and legal processes out of the window . W HAT was and is the psychosis that explains our behavior ? Perhaps it is a sense , still unformulated and only half conscious , that our strength is less solid than it seems , that it is threatened , not by Russia or Communist drive , but by internal ailments that may be beyond cure  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakening of really free enterprise , to the failure of capital to use its concentrated , almost unchecked power in ways that will preserve even itself , much less the economic stability of the nation or the world . People sense  --  dimly remembering the twenties  --  that our inflated prosperity is a symptom of disease , not a show of health . They know that private enterprise is , by its nature , the enemy of planning , except when it plans for its own larger return , but they suspect that only planning on a world scale can save the human race from catastrophe . If they listen to the primitive economics declaimed by most of the men who make our laws , they may outwardly applaud , but inwardly they ask : What 's going to happen ? Things do n't feel steady . - The heresy hunt , I suspect , is a dodge to escape our own buried fears , our sense of restless insecurity . Free enterprise is all right . America is all right . They must be , because we 've been told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Moscow . So let 's get those people and we 'll feel okay again . But back there , in the underground of the mind , saboteurs are at work telling us that what went on between 1919 and 1939 is still going on , only at a faster rate , and that even rich , tough America is not proof against it . A once-powerful system has been liquidated over much of the earth . It is prostrate , waiting for our strength to give it back the strength it lost through the crumbling of its foundations in two wars and a disastrous interval of revolution and fascist domination . Can we put the rotten system on its feet ? Can we save our own not-so-sound system from similar collapse ? The questions hang in the air and in the underlayers of the American consciousness . Loyalty tests , red hunts , even liberal apologetics for " moderate " forms of repression  --  these are the compulsive , unreal answers our emotions provide to spare us the need of looking for the real ones .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
