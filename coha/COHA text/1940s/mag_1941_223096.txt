Nobody ever accused Japan or Germany of having a sense of humor ; and only they could have staged the puppet show that amused the world last week . One by one Germany 's battery of stooges-Rumania , Croatia , Slovakia , Italy and Bulgaria-announced they would recognize Japan 's Wang Ching-wei and his marionette Government in Nanking . Germany did likewise . This was Germany 's bid for Japan 's help , or at least good will , in the Russo-German war . <P> Uncertain Japan still struggled to revise her foreign policy in the light of the new facts of that war . For hours an imperial conference , graced on this momentous occasion by the presence of the Emperor himself , wrestled with the problems of statecraft . The conferees emerged with their decision . But the decision was a secret . <P> This was a " super-emergency , " said Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka . <P> Out of it only a handful of facts made their way into the press , all interesting , none definitive . <P> &gt; Notes were sent by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in friendship by solemn covenant and pact . <P> &gt; Activity of the near-million Japanese soldiers on the China front came to a dead halt ( see below ) . <P> &gt; Japan canceled ship sailings to the east coast of the U.S. , requisitioned other vessels . ( This would be the logical move if Japan were planning to ship a big expeditionary force somewhere . ) <P> &gt; Japan hinted she would extend Japanese territorial waters if necessary to prevent U.S. supplies reaching Vladivostok . <P> Taken all together , the facts could only mean that Japan was now preparing for dramatic action . Although the hard-headed soldiers who run Japan knew better than to bind themselves to any oversimple , irrevocable decision of action , the courses open to them were few-and all dangerous . They included : 1 ) a new major campaign in China , 2 ) a southward drive , 3 ) a jackal attack on the rear of the Soviet Union while Germany drains Russian strength in the west . Best bet : No. 3.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
