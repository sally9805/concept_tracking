" In spite of optimism , philanthropy , and youth conferences , this is one hell of a world for kids to be trying to grow up in . " <P> So said Columbia 's famed Sociologist Robert S. Lynd ( Middletown , Middletown in Transition ) , at a youth conference in New York 's City Hall . The trend which alarmed this veteran tracker of U.S. trends was the prospect that the nation 's early-teenagers are growing up to be a new " lost " generation like that in Germany and Austria after World War I. " Too young for the glory of having been in war , " said he , they will be " passed over when jobs are given returning veterans . " <P> Mayor LaGuardia , echoing this gloomy prediction , wondered why youths should now be learning such trades as plumbing , drafting , electricity , and sheet-metal work in the city 's Building Trades High School when " tens of thousands " of servicemen are being trained in them . " Why train more people for the next five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ca n't find employment ? " <P> In Washington next day , Dr. Winfred Overholser , head of St. Elizabeth 's federal mental hospital , predicted an era of loose living beyond anything seen in the " Jazz Age " of Postwar I. He declared : " The loosening of morals started after the last war has continued ever since , and is reaching a new high , as evidenced by the soaring tide in illegitimacy . " <P> For the World <P> Whether or not the whole world has been badly brought up , most citizens of the United Nations agree that there is something wrong with education in the Axis countries . One man who wants to correct that miseducation is Grayson N. Kefauver , dean ( on leave ) of Stanford 's School of Education and State Department consultant on cultural cooperation . This week , after six months ' study and consultation with fellow experts in London , Kefauver made an interim report . Its basic recommendation : set up a United Nations educational and cultural agency . Among other things this agency , by action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control education in Axis nations . <P> Give emergency and continuing aid toward restoring the buildings and equipment of schools and colleges in ravaged United Nations . <P> Replace valuable books looted from occupied countries with similar books from Axis libraries , and set up a globe-circulating library of rare and valuable books . <P> New Books for Old <P> Said the New York City Board of Education : " Many of us feel that the methods of the past have not engendered the love for books that children should have . Many of the textbooks . . . are worn , dog-eared , and filthy . . . hardly an inspiration to future book lovers . " <P> Trying something new , the Board last week placed an initial order for 600,000 new books for public-school children ( sample authors : Mark Twain , Stevenson , Dickens , O. Henry ) with eye-catching illustrations drawn mostly by the children themselves . These will be distributed free to 7th , 8th , and 9th grade pupils , to keep for their very own . <P> " The Record Stinks "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
