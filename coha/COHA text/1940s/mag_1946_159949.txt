American womanhood had never struck so rich a bonanza as during the wartime expansion of the U.S. merchant marine . Superstition of the sea had busied thousands of nervous feminine hands with the christening of ships . And after smashing her bottle , each ship sponsor took home a souvenir gift . Some of the trinkets would have lit fire in the eyes of a Follies girl . <P> Last week the masculine stare of the Senate 's Mead Committee fastened on a list of the haul . The committee had nothing against women , as such . It just wanted to know how much taxpayers ' money shipbuilders had lavished on honorarious baubles . The million-dollar tally sheet , 130 pages long , did not tell who paid the bill . But the faces that launched 5,500 ships were a gold mine for gossipers . <P> Female relatives of the late Vice Admiral Howard L. Vickery , former vice chairman of the Maritime Commission , had been in special demand as bottle-smashers . Five had received $6,457.65 in shipyard gifts ; Daughter Barbara 's share included two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ship named in her husband 's honor , was handed a $25 gimmick . <P> Shipbuilders ' generosity rose and fell with the tide . One yard gave Cinemactress Greer Garson a $74 silver cigaret box . Another thought the wife of F.D.R. 's Chief of Staff William D. Leahy rated a $2,516.75 jeweled bracelet . Eleanor Roosevelt , for launching a light carrier , was given a tray , a photo album and warstamp corsage , altogether worth $553.50 . The Sun Shipbuilding &; Drydock Co. at Chester , Pa. , honored 252 women most handsomely ; $750 was the least it ever spent on any one of them . <P> In picking their sponsors , Government contractors had a crush on the wives of Washington bigwigs . Mrs. James F. Byrnes broke two bottles and received a $349.90 gold brooch and a $1,820.12 tray . Mrs. Claude Pepper 's record of six christenings was second only to the eight splashed up by California 's first lady , Mrs. Earl Warren . Mrs. Henry Wallace , Mrs. Arthur Vandenberg and the wife of economy-minded Comptroller General Lindsay Warren all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Brehon B. Somervell , wife of the wartime Chief of the Army Service Forces , $31 in silverware was the best Millionheiress Doris Duke could do . <P> The shipbuilders overlooked no one : Sophie Tucker , Mrs. Henry J. Kaiser , Elsa Maxwell , Madame Ivy Litvinov , the Dionne Quintuplets , Barbara Douglas Arnold , daughter of Planemaker Donald Douglas . For helping to launch the S.S. Mormacisle a $225 gold pin was given to Mrs. James M. Mead Jr. , daughter-in-law of the Senate investigator himself .
