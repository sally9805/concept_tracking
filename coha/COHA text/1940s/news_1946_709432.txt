txt The Republic Aviation corporation said today that the P-84 jet fighters it was building for the army were equipped with " shotgun type pilot ejector seats which throw an airmail out of the plane in the event he wants to bail oul . " A company spokesman said the fighter planes had " cannon type " catapults loaded with gunpowder charges which " actually shoots an airman out of the cockpit " in an emergency . " It 's just a way of getting a flyer out of a plane traveling at speeds approaching the speed of sound , " the spokesman said . Here 's the way the spokesmen described the device : The cylinder cannon containing a charge comparable to that in a 75 millimeter shell is attached by piston to the pilot 's seat , which is ejected when the flyer " pulls the trigger " to bail out . Before the detonation takes place , the mechanism automatically releases the cockpit canopy above the pilot 's head to permit his exit .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
