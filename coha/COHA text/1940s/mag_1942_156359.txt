The Navy was gradually getting the better of U-boats in the Atlantic . At the same time the first chill of autumn , bringing intermittent fogs , marked the opening of better weather for submarines . But possibly neither of these things was so important last week as the launching of a vessel which , when completed , will be the only United Nations battleship afloat able , without giving odds , to take on the powerful Nazi Tirpitz , sister of the sunken Bismarck . <P> The U.S.S. Iowa , first of a class of six , went down the ways at the Brooklyn Navy Yard , the heaviest* hull ever set afloat . When complete , she will weigh about 45,000 tons ( 52,000 with full load ) . To launch her 45 tons of grease were needed and she slid down into the water on four sets of ways . <P> The Iowa , with 10,000 tons of additional protection and speed ( designed for 35 knots compared to 27 ) , isa faster , tougher version of the North Carolina type carrying nine 16-inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iowa is protected against aerial bombs , submarine torpedoes , surface shellfire . Her 200,000-h.p. engines are ten times as powerful as those of the old ( 1910 ) Wyoming . Her auxiliary power plant , the one that lights the lights and turns the turrets , churns up enough electricity for a city of 20,000-more horsepower ( 14,000 ) than a pre-World War I dreadnought could muster for all purposes . <P> Six well-placed torpedoes might do for the Iowa , but she is so speedy that a 21-knot submarine ( even slower submerged ) would be hard put to it to get into firing range or draw a bead on her . A destroyer trying it would likely get sunk . A mine could only sting the Iowa . Her heavy guns match any on land or sea , and with them she could have taken on the whole German battle fleet of Jutland . On the surface , these new ships can take care of themselves . <P> But in World War II 's new third dimension , the air , the Iowa and ships like her are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a lucky hit down a funnel into the magazine might do for her . High-altitude precision bombing could be crippling if delivered in a pattern so that the Iowa 's speed and maneuverability could n't save her . More damaging would be close-in , suicidal plane attack-and even with her announced 20-gun , 5-inch secondary battery , sixteen 1.1-inch anti-aircraft guns and unannounced small-caliber armament , the Iowa alone could n't stave it off . <P> Against concentrated plane attack she must have help from planes , whether carrier-or land-based . <P> Considering this fact , citizens who read about the 4,500,000 man-days in her making and the 1,100 miles of blueprint paper in her plans might remember torpedo planes , wonder whether it would not have been more practical to finish Passamaquoddy after all . They had all heard that the plane had made the dreadnought an anachronism , that the carrier was king , that the U.S. had already abandoned or postponed five projected 58,000-ton super-super-battleships . Would the Iowa spend the war ignominiously tied to a dock ? Almost certainly not .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
