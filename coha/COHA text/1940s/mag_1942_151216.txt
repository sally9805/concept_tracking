As the reporters gathered in the bare room on Chungking hill , they chatted about the news , which they had already heard . Finally China 's official spokesman , onetime Ambassador to Russia Dr. T. F. Chiang* ( no kin ) , came in . Man-of-the-world , he showed no particular excitement as he said in faultless English : <P> " It is gratifying news to learn that President Roosevelt has sent a message to Congress asking for a $500,000,000 loan to China and that the British Government has made known it is ready to lend China 50,000,000 . " <P> The Illness . For four weary years China had dreamed about beating the Japanese by means of some whopping generosity from the democracies . Here , at last , was aid on the scale about which China had dreamed . At current rates of exchange the two loans would add up to almost 13 billion Chinese dollars . <P> The reporters listening to Dr. Chiang knew that each of those dollars would be a blessing to China , because China is in the throes of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term to people who have not lived through one . To reporters on Chungking hill it was anything but meaningless . They knew that the Government had perforce solved most of its fiscal worries in the war years by printing money . They knew that fiscal reform , the main point of which had been Government assumption of the land tax , had not worked too well . They knew that mistrust of the Government 's money had driven many Chinese , rich &; poor , to selfish hoarding , particularly of rice . <P> More personally , they knew that Chungking prices had risen 2,000% since the beginning of the war . ( In U.S. terms , a package of cigarets would cost $3 , a man 's shirt $50 , a pair of medium-priced woman 's shoes $160 . One might , with luck , buy a bottle of Scotch for $60 , but a quart of champagne would cost over $200 . ) <P> The Harassed Doctor . The man whose job it has been to try to stem China 's inflation , and whose Ministry has often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. H. H. ( " Daddy " ) Rung . Seldom has even a horse- &-buggy; doctor operated under such harassments as the coolie- &-ricksha; society of bomb-torn Chungking has imposed on aristocratic Dr. Kung , 75th descendant of Confucius . An active ingredient of the inflation has been lack of confidence in the finances of the Chiang Kai-shek Government . Some of his henchmen have been accused of worse things than incompetency . And so a large measure of the responsibility in turning the U.S. and British loans to good uses will rest on the shoulders of the Generalissimo 's loyal Dr. Kung . <P> The Treatment . With 13 billion Chinese dollars ' worth of U.S. and British credit to play with , Daddy Kung ought now to be able to operate more successfully on the gangrene of inflation . Dr. Chiang suggested some ways this might be accomplished : <P> &gt;Increase of confidence . " We are sure our Allies will continue to give us aid . " <P> &gt;Issue of domestic bonds based on these loans . These bonds would be presented as long-range savings and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the recklessly printed banknotes ; 2 ) deter some of the hoarding , which is a form of short-range savings .
