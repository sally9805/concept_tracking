Whiskey and gin are almost unobtainable by the bottle ; even in bars the supply is very low . <P> The nation 's wine stocks are also depleted . Last week the auction of a late Mayfair hostess ' cellar brought these smacking prices : German white wines , $240 per dozen bottles ; four bottles of Cointreau , $136 , and seven of orange Curagao , $160 ; Chateau Pichon-Longueville claret , $26 a bottle .
