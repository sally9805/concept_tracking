The Massacre of the Jews THERE ARE some things so horrible that decent men and women find them impossible to believe , so monstrous that the civilized world recoils incredulous before them . The recent reports of the systematic extermination of the Jews in Nazi Europe are of this order . We are accustomed to horrors in the historical past , and accept them as a matter of course . The persecution of the Jews in Egypt and the Roman Empire , the slaughters of Genghis Khan , the religious mania which swept Europe in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries , the Indian massacres in America , and the equally brutal retaliations of the white men ? all these we credit without question , as phenomena of ages less enlightened than our own . When such things occur in our own times , like the Armenian massacres , we put them down to the account of still half-barbarous peoples . But that such things could be done by contemporary western Europeans , heirs of the humanist tradition , seems hardly possible . Our skepticism has been fortified by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . We were treated , during that war , to many accounts of German atrocities . We were told of the rape of nuns , the forced prostitution of young Belgian girls , of German soldiers spearing infants on their bayonets , or deliberately and wantonly cutting off their hands . Later , when the bitterness of war had subsided , and Allied investigators were able to interview the populations of the formerly occupied countries , and scholars were let loose on the documents , most of these atrocities were found to have been invented . The natural reaction was to label all atrocity stories " propaganda " and refuse to believe them . That habit of thought has lasted down to the present day . The Nazis have given us many reasons to change our thinking habits since they assumed power , but we have been slow to learn the new lesson . I remember how skeptical I was myself the first time a Nazi official told me that Hitler and Goebbels were bent on the physical annihilation of the Jews . On July 15 , 1935 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in Berlin at the time and witnessed the whole thing . I saw the S. A. men , unmistakable despite their mufti , throwing chairs and tables through the plate-glass windows of Jewish-owned caf ? s , dragging Jewish men and women out of buses and chasing them up the streets , or knocking them down and kicking them in the face and belly as they lay prostrate on the sidewalk . And I heard them chanting their terrible song : The next day , in a state of high indignation , I went to see " Putzi " Hanfstaengl , then chief of the Foreign Press Division of the Propaganda Ministry . On my way to his office , I learned that one of the victims of the previous night 's bestiality had already died of his injuries . Yet , when Hanfstaengl told me , in his cultured Harvard accent , that the " radicals " among the Nazi Party leaders intended to " solve " the " Jewish problem " by the physical extermination of the Jews , I only half believed him . It was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June 3o , 1934 ; yet even then I could not believe that there were men in positions of power and authority in western Europe in the twentieth century who could seriously entertain such a monstrous idea . I learned better in November , 1938 , when the Nazi leaders openly encouraged the burning of synagogues ; the pillage of Jewish homes and the murder of then ' inhabitants . One reason the Western world ' failed to rouse itself more promptly to the Nazi menace was surely this tendency to dismiss as impossible fantasy the many warnings the Nazis themselvts gave us . We made the terrible mistake of judging the Nazis by our own standards , failing even after the war had begun to realize how completely they had renounced , if indeed they had ever espoused , those standards . Even today , after more than three years of the Nazi kind of war Europe , and more than one year of direct experience with it ourselves , there are still far too many among us who do not understand the nature of the enemy --  an enemy who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And his ends are the enslavement or anniln14 ation not only of the Jews but , after them , of all the non-German peoples of Europe and , if possible , the entire world . The program is already far advanced . According to 11 report to the President by leaders of American Jewisti groups , nearly 2,000,000 European Jews have ahead , been slain since the war began , and the remaining 5,000,000 now living under Nazi control are scheduled to be destroyed as soon as Hitler 's blond butcher ? can get around to them . Of the 275,000 Jews who were living in Germany and Austria at the outbreak the war , only 52,000 to 5S,000 remain . The 1707 ? 0 ? Jews in Czecho-Slovakia have been reduced to 350 ? ' The figures for Poland , where the Nazi program has been pushed very rapidly , are uncertain . There were 3,300,000 Jews in Poland at the beginning of the " P but some 500,000 fled to Russia , leaving approxitnal 2,800,000 behind . By the beginning of the summer 1942 , this number had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deportations and massacres since that WI ? DECEMBER 2 1 ) 1 9 4 2 have been on an ever increasing scale . In the ghetto of Warsaw , in which 550,000 Jews once dwelt , there are today fewer than 50,000 . In the city of Riga , Latvia , 8,000 Jews were killed in a single night . A week later 16,000 more were led into a woods , stripped and machine-gunned . It is not merely central and eastern Europe which are being " purged , " or rendered " Judenrein , " as the Nazis like to say . The Netherlands has already given up 60,000 of its i8o,00o Jews . Of the 85,000 who once lived in Belgium only 8,000 remain today , while of the 340,000 Jews of France , more than 65,000 have been deported . Even Norway has begun to ship her Jewish citizens eastward to the Nazi slaughter houses and starvation pens . The methods employed by the Nazis are many . There is starvation : Jews all over Europe are kept on rations often only one-third or one-fourth what is allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is deportation : Jews by the hundreds of thousands have been packed into cattle cars , without food , water or sanitary conveniences of any sort , and shipped the whole breadth of Europe . When the cars arrive at their destination , about a third of the passengers are already dead . There are the extermination centers , where Jews are destroyed by poison gas or electricity . There are specially constructed trucks , in which Jews are asphyxiated by carbon monoxide from the exhausts , on their way to burial trenches . There are the mines , in which they are worked to death , or poisoned by fumes of metals . There is burning alive , in crematoria , or buildings deliberately set on fire . There is the method of injecting air-bubbles into the blood stream : it is cheap , dean and efficient , producing clots , embolisms and death within a few hours . And there is the good old-fashioned system of standing the victims up , very often naked , and machine-gunning them , preferrably beside the graves they themselves have been forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A few weeks ago a letter reached me from Paris . It had been smuggled over the demarcation line and two international borders and mailed in Lisbon . It told of the deportation of the Jews of Paris , which occurred in July . All Polish , Czech , German , Austrian and Russian Jews between the ages of two and fifty-five were arrested . The women and children , to the number of 15,000 , were herded into the notorious Velodrome d'Hiver , where they were kept for a week , without any bedding but straw , with very inadequate food , and with virtually no sanitary facilities . Then they were packed into cattle cars and shipped to an unknown destination in eastern Europe . My informant , a member of the trade-union underground , tells me that some days later a French railway worker picked up a scrap of paper on the tracks . On it was written this message : " There are more than fifty women in this cattle car , some of them ill , and for days we have been refused even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French Red Cross nurse who worked in the Velodrome , tells exactly the same story , describing it as " something horrible , fiendish , something which takes hold of your throat and prevents you from crying out . " A German Social Democrat whom I know well sent me a long report on the deportations , written at the beginning of September . " I am an incorrigible optimist , " he concluded , " but this time I see dark things ahead . . . . I am afraid not many of us will live to see the end of this war . " And a Frenchman , not himself a Jew , wrote a long report on the deportations and had it brought to me in a toothpaste tube . " We were at the Camp des Miles near Marseilles the day the last train left , " he says . " The spectacle was indescribably painful to behold . All the internees had been lined up with their pitifully battered valises tied together with bits of string . Most of them were in rags , pale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragged out for more than a week . Many of them were quietly weeping . . . . There was no sign of revolt : these people were broken . Their faces showed only hopeless despair and a passive acceptance of their fate . " Later , when Jews not already in concentration camps were being rounded up , he wrote : " A large number of these desperate people , in just about all sections , tried to end their lives . In Marseilles , in the Cours Belsunce the heart of the city , a refugee couple jumped out of the window at the very moment the police arrived to arrest them ... . Many , realizing the danger they were in . . . disappeared from their homes and hid . " These are all letters I myself have received from persons I know , or know to be reliable . They concern only France . But the evidence for the other countries is of a similar , direct sort . There are , for instance , the two pathetic letters from Warsaw . I have seen photostats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were mailed , in the office of the American Jewish Congress . Written in German , they passed the German censor only because he did not understand the few Hebrew words in them , taking them , as he was intended to , for proper names . " I spoke to Mr. Jaeger , " one of them goes . " Mr. Jaeger " means the Germans . " He told me that he will invite all relatives of the family Achenu Hebrew for " our brethren , " i. e. , the Jews , with the exception of Miss Eisenzweig probably means those working in the iron mines , from Warsaw to his mansion %ewer ' Hebrew for " tomb " . Uncle Gerusch Hebrew for " deportation " also works in Warsaw ; he is a very capable worker . My friend Miso Hebrew for " death " now works with him . I am alone here ; I feel very lonely . . . . Please pray for me . " The New York office of the General Jewish Workers ' Union of Poland has received from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas executions the details of which are as revolting as they are convincing . In the office of the World Jewish Congress in Geneva there is an affidavit , attested copies of which have been received here , recounting the extraordinary odyssey of a Polish Jew who was living in Brussels . On August 12 he was arrested and deported to Rumania . There were seventy men in his cattle car , packed in like crowds in the subway during rush hour . After two and a half days , their train stopped in Upper Silesia , and they were allowed to get out of the car , have a short rest , and eat a little soup . Those too exhausted to continue the journey were carried away , as were all boys between fourteen and twenty ( to work , it was said , in the coal mines and the iron mills ) . The others were then loaded back into the cars and shipped on to the Ukraine . There they were asked whether they felt able to work or not . About half said that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The others were given the uniforms of the Todt Organization and set to work building fortifications . From where they were working they could hear the rumble of big guns to the east , and once they saw a sign reading " Stalingrad ? so km . " The Jew from Brussels made friends with a young Bavarian officer , not . a Nazi , and learned from him that the men who had not been able to work had all been immediately shot . Anyone who was sick for more than two days was shot also , the officer said . In the end the officer helped the Jew to hide himself in a train which was returning to the West . After many days the Jew found himself on a siding at the Gare de l'Est in Paris . From there he made his way to Switzerland , where he told his story . This is the nature of the evidence . Letters , reports , cables all fit together . They add up to the most appalling picture of mass murder in all human history . Nor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assert that many hundreds of thousands of non-Jewish Poles have been slain with equal callousness , and soberly warn that the entire Polish people may be wiped out before this war is over . The decimation of the Greek people is a matter of record . The Nazis are evidently quite indifferent to it , if they do not actually welcome it . Thousands of French will die of hunger and cold this winter , and thousands more will never be born , either because the fathers who might have begotten them are being held in Nazi prison camps , or because the mothers are too undernourished to carry them . The same thing is true of many other countries of Europe . And by their executions of " hostages " the Nazis are systematically destroying the potential leaders of democratic move-merits in all the countries they have overrun . We must face the terrible truth . Even though Hitler loses this war , he may win it anyway , at least as far as Europe is concerned . There are reports , apparently trustworthy , that the Nazis and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their plans call for the extermination of every living thing and the destruction of all physical property in the areas they may be forced to evacuate . When we remember that , even after the war of 1914-18 was hopelessly lost and the German army was retreating in confusion on the Western Front , it still found time , and the will , wantonly to destroy the factories and flood the mines in its path , we may well believe that this time it will be even more thorough , go even more berserk . If this happens , we shall be confronted with the most frightful dilemma imaginable . Every man , woman and child in Europe will become a hostage , a means of blackmail . If we continue the war , they will die . Yet if we do not continue the war , the Nazis will have won all they can then hope to win ? time . Time to regroup their forces , divide ours and strike again . Our only course then will be to overwhelm them so rapidly that they will not be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need all the strength we can possibly muster , and all the courage . The Nazis will certainly hope to cut off our allies one by one by threatening the total annihilation of their peoples if they continue to oppose them . We and our allies must be prepared to face the challenge unflinchingly . Meanwhile , there are some things which can be done now , slight as the chances are that they will have much effect in deterring Hitler and his followers from their homicidal mania . President Roosevelt could and should speak out again against these monstrous events . A stern warning from him will have no effect on Hitler , but it may impress some Germans like the officer who helped the Jew from Brussels to escape . A similar warning from Churchill might help , too . A joint declaration , couched in the most solemn terms , by the Allied governments , of the retribution to come might be of some avail . Tribunals should be set up now to begin to amass the facts . Diplomatic warnings , conveyed through neutral channels , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least some of the 700,000 to 900,000 Jews still within their bor. ders . The Christian churches might also help , at least in countries like France , Holland , Belgium , Nonni , the Pope by threatening with excommunication all Catholics who in any way participate in these frightful crimes , the Protestant leaders by exhorting their low communicants to resist to the utmost the Nave fiendish designs . We and our allies should perhals reconsider our policy of total blockade of the Ear ' pean continent and examine the possibilities of extend ' ing the feeding of Greece to other occupied countries , under neutral supervision . Since one of the excuse ! the Nazis now offer for destroying the Jews and DECEMBER 2I , 19 4 2 Poles is that there is not enough food to go around , we might at least remove the grounds for the excuse by offering to feed the populations of the occupied countries , given proper guarantees that the food will not fall into the hands of the enemy . If we do any or all of these things , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every country of Europe , in every European language . There is a report , which I have not been able to verify , that the OWI has banned mention of the massacres in its shortwave broadcasts . If this is true , it is a sadly mistaken policy . We have nothing to gain by " appeasing " the anti-Semites and the murderers . We have much to gain by using the facts to create resistance and eventually rebellion . The fact that the Nazis do not commit their massacres in western Europe , but transport their victims to the East before destroying them , is certain proof that they fear the effect on the local populations of the news of their crimes . Finally , and it is a little thing , but at the same time a big thing , we can offer asylum now , without delay or red tape , to those few fortunate enough to escape from the Aryan paradise . We can do this without any risk to ourselves , because we can intern the refugees on arrival , and examine them at leisure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about any of them , we can keep them interned for the duration of the war . Despite the fact that the urgency of the situation has never been greater , immigration into the United States in the year 1942 will have been less than ten percent of what it has been in " normal " years before Hitler , when some of the largest quotas were not filled . There have been bureaucratic delays in visa procedure which have literally condemned to death many stalwart democrats . These delays have caused an understandable bitterness among Jews and non-Jews in Europe , who have looked to us for help which did not come . My Marseilles correspondent , who is neither a Jew nor a candidate for a visa , writes that , " in spite of the Nazi pressure , which she feels more than any other neutral , and in spite too of the reactionary tendencies of her middle dass , the little country of Switzerland will by accepting 9,000 refugees from Nazi terror since July have contributed more to the cause of humanity than the great and wealthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people and the defense of liberty notwithstanding . " This is a challenge which we can not , must not , ignore .
