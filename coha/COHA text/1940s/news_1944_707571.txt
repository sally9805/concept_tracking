txt Col. William O'Dwyer , District Attorney of Kings County now on military leave , is prepared to recommend executive clemency for Louis ( Lepke ) Buchalter , Emanuel Weiss and Louis Capone , it was asserted today at a clemency hearing conducted by Governor Dewey for the three men , sentenced to death for the murder of a Brooklyn candystore owner in 1936 . This announcement , made by Arthur Garfield Hays , one of the battery of counsel for the condemned men , fell like a bombshell on the crowded Executive Chamber and brought forth spluttering statements of disbelief from representatives of the District Attorney 's office , present to oppose extension of clemency . In Brooklyn last night , Acting District Attorney Thomas Cradock Hughes , who said he had been in touch with Col. William O'Dwyer by telephone , denied emphatically that the District Attorney had promised to recommend clemency if he were called upon to do so . Mr. Hughes said Colonel O'Dwyer had discussed the case with Mr. Hays on the telephone last summer and had told the lawyer he would make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as having told Mr. Hays that Mr. Hughes would make the sole recommendation to Governor Dewey and that that recommendation would be expressed at the clemency hearing by Assistant District Attorneys Burton B. Turkus and Solomon Klein . Mr. Hays , after urging commutation of the sentence on the basis of the trial record , told of a conversation he had with Colonel O'Dwyer last fall in which the District Attorney said he was ready to urge clemency " if Mr. Dewey will ask me about it . " The colonel , according to Mr. Hays , said he still believed the men guilty , but that " anyone who sees the Court of Appeals decision has to believe there ought to be a commutation . " This court split sharply in the cote , although the convictions were sustained by a vote of four to three . In all , four opinions were written , Chief Judge Irving Leh , man , who cast the deciding vote , writing that the State 's testimony // LEPKE CASE RUNS INTO O'DWYER SNAG // was " borne out only by the testimony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Assistant District Attorney Solomon A. Klein said flatly he refused " to accept Mr. Hays ' concept of the conversation . " His associate , Burton B. Turkus , who prosecuted the case , declared the report of such a conversation was " beyond my comprehension . " Both said Colonel O'Dwyer had never intimated to them that he thought there was ground tor clemency . Even Governor Dewey was somawhat shaken from the calm with which he had been conducting the two-and-a-half hour hearing , attended by the wives of the condemned men . He said this disclosure might produce " a little difficulty , " because he had a communication from Acting District Attorney Thomas Cradock Hughes opposing clemency . In reply , Mr. Hays said the conversation was " exactly " as he had told it and that Colonel O'Dwyer had given him permission to use it . Mr. Turkus produced the second sensation of the hearing when he recounted how Lepke 's mob " coldly sat down and planned the murder of a public official who was investigating them , " then recon-sidered , " because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heads of organized crime the wrath of the whole nation . " It was apparent to everyone that the public official concerned was Mr. Dewey , then a special prosecutor , but the Governor failed to show any reaction . Want Commission Named Others appearing for the condemned men , scheduled to die a week from tomorrow , were Sydney Rosenthal , representing Capone , and I. Maurice Worrnser and J. Bertram Wegman , counsel to Buchalter . They urged that the Governor appoint a special commission to investigate the facts in the case , including new evidence upon which the defense is now seeking a new trial . Highlighting this evidence was a letter from John Fiano , former guard at Sing Sing prison who is now an Army sergeant . Writing from Camp Campbell , Ky. , Fiano told of overhearing a conversation in Sing Sing 's death house between Harry ( Happy ) Malone and Frank ( Dasher ) Abbadando to the effect that Weiss and Capone were falsely convicted . According to Sergeant Fiano , Malone said he committeed the murder . Both Malone and Abbadando @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counsel urged that Fiano be communicated with , in addition to others , including one Mike Sicoff , who they said could offer testimony that would warrant extension of clemency to Lepke , Weiss and Capone . The Governor , however , while asking the men to submit whatever evidence or affidavits they might have , said he saw no justification for the appointment of a commis ' sion . No Link to Labor Leaders The hearing failed to produce any reference to knowledge Lepke is said to have of an old Brooklyn murder involving labor leaders said to be close to the present National Administration . This knowledge is ' reported to be one of the factors 1 that led to the long and involved negotiations for the transfer of Lepke from Federal to State hands . Lepke had been serving fourteen years in Federal prison for selling narcotics . Throughout the long hearing , defense counsel contended that their , clients were " bad men , " but that they had not had a fair trial and that there was enough room for doubt to warrant the Governor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the presiding judge at the trial was standing for re-election that year while Mr. O'Dwyer was running for Mayor . It was further said that Mr. Turkus , in summing up , intimated that prosecution witnesses of a shady character would get " no Christmas presents , " but that they actually were freed later . Governor Dewey reserved decision and gave no intimation that he would grant either a stay of execution , set for a week from tomorrow , or clemency to any or all of the men . Tells of Talk With O'Dwyer Answering a statement made in Albany by Arthur Garfield Hays that Col. William O'Dwyer would recommend clemency if called upon to do so , Acting District Attorney Thomas Cradock Hughes , in Brooklyn , last night made the following statement : " I have just completed a telephone conversation with Colonel O'Dwyer . He told me that last summer at a time when he was in New York City he received a telephone call from Mr. Hays . Mr. Hays asked Colonel O'Dwyer if he would not take the position , first , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he did not believe that their guilt was clearly established , and , third , that on account of the differences of opinion in the Court of Appeals did he not think there should be a commuta-tion ? " Colonel O'Dwyer told Mr. Hays that he was satisfied that they were guilty beyond all doubt , that he was satisfied they had been given a fair trial , that he would have felt better satisfied if there were not such differences of opinion in the Court of Appeals . " Mr. Hays wanted Colonel O'Dwyer to appear before Governor Dewey and make a recommendation . Colonel O'Dwyer told Mr. Hays that there was nothing he could add to the record ; that all the facts were before the Governor , and that the Governor would take all the facts into consideration . " Mr. Hays further pressed Colonel O'Dwyer to go before Governor Dewey and recommend clemency . Colonel O'Dwyer very emphatically told Mr. Hays that he certainly would not appear before the Governor . He told him further he would make no recommendation , and further informed Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recommendation by the office as expressed in a communication from Acting District Attorney Hughes to Governor Dewey and as expressed by Assistant District Attorneys Burton B. Turkus and Solomon A. Klein. "
