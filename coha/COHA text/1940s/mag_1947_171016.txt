Elder Statesman Herbert Hoover , the only living ex-President of the United States , mulled over the cause &; effect of World War II in the American magazine last week : " We never would have been attacked by the Japanese if we had not given them provocation . ... If we had kept out of the immediate conflict , we could have put our sword down on the table , with our economic resources intact , and made a decent peace when the time for peacemaking came . I never believed Britain was in danger of defeat . When Germany attacked Russia , it made a British victory possible . " <P> Commented South Carolina 's Democratic Senator Olin D. Johnston : " Mr. Hoover 's hindsight appears to be as bad as his foresight . "
