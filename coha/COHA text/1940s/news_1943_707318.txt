" " The prices of land seem fantastic , " said a Stockton real estate man of 40 years ' experience , " but they are no more fantastic than the returns some growers are getting for their crops " The RIchrat County Stockton is in San Joaquin County , which . year in and year out , bobs up as the richest or near-richest agricultural county in the United States It provides a good cross-section view of California 's highly diveraitied , highly specialized agriculture  --  and of the new farm land boom A myriad of peat islands , lying in the joint delta of the San Joaquin and Sacramento rivers , have been reclaimed for the cultivation of 300,000 acres ihalf the size of Rhode Island ) This incredibly rich soil , lying below sea level , is readily irrigated , but offers the problem of pumping out the water afterwards Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflammable and farm bands are n't encouraged to throw lighted matches around From this r9gion comes most of the canning asparagus and a big share of the freshshipping asparagus grown in the United States . Here , Georke Shims , the Japanese potato king . made his millions in the first world war Just about any farm crop will grow and grow well in this prodigal delta Crops are harvested the year round and two crops a year is common practice . Because the growth is so lush newcomers can seldom resist the urge to farm more and more land As a result many become over-extended and there are signs that this is in process now Illustrative of this trend  --  a year ago a big holding was broken up . one tract of raw land suitable for asparagus culture selling for $150 an acre . Toda ? . similar land brings $250 an acre Bare delta land , without improvements , is selling for 5120 an acre against $90 one year ago .

On the latter basis rethrns have run all the way I ram 5500 an acre to $1,350 from grapes that have cost from $100 to $300 an acre to ; row and harvest . Two thousand dollars an acre as a selling price for this land does n't seem out of line , if this year 's returns were average . But , the land men say , they are distinctly exceptional , and the buyer at that price is headed for trouble in the future . The same sort of story is being told about the orange groves in the San Gabriel Valley . They are usually planted 90 trees to the acre , and conservatively should yield four boxes of oranges to the tree .

The beat Valencia groves , running five boxes a tree . will bring in receipts of $900 to $1,000 an acre , while maintenance and cultivation costs including water , spraying , fertilizer , taxes and the like will run to $200 to $250 an acre . A net to the grower of $500 an acre is a good average . " The average size of the groves , " says an expert . " is from 6 to 10 acres , giving the owners $3,000 to $7,000 for the year , in addition to their shelter . The better Valencia groves are the ones that are now bringing $3,000 to $4,000 an acre when sold . This year the Valencia movement out of California has been the highest on record , in June and July , with all sales at maximum ceiling prices .

" The only bright spot in the picture is that new groves are n't being planted , because it takes six years to bring an orange grove into production , and the speculator ca n't and the labor to plant and care for non-producing trees for that long a period A Stockton banker commented that most of the high pr.ces for land are being paid by buyers who are not farmers and do n't know that it takes a good farmer on good land to make money consistently : or by farmers who have gone land-crazy .
