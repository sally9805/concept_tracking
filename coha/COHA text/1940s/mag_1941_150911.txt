A poll to check on polls was started last week at the University of Denver . Called the National Opinion Research Center , it claimed to be the first non-commercial organization to measure public opinion in the U.S. Its functions : to take its own polls on all sorts of public questions , to analyze results of other polls , to study how to improve polling methods . <P> Marshal Field , backer of the New York tabloid PM , put up the money . The Center 's board of directors includes two social psychologists , Princeton 's Professor Hadley Cantril and Harvard 's Professor Gordon W. Allport , and University of Denver 's Chancellor Caleb F. Gates Jr. , onetime star Princeton tackle and track man . For active operators the academicians will lean on two experienced pollsters , British-born Harry H. Field ( no kin to Marshall Field ) , who worked six years for George Gallup and organized the British Institute of Public Opinion , and F. Douglas Williams , who worked for Elmo Roper , conductor of the FORTUNE Poll . <P> The Denver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a thing which is the urgent concern of all reliable pollsters . It also intends to take polls , at cost , for legislators and U.S. Congressmen who may want to know what their own constituents think about specific issues , for Government departments , for educators , for non-profit organizations . Sample poll under consideration : what do Denverites think of the controversial syst em of Progressive education in their public schools ? <P> The Center is Harry Field 's idea and both Messrs . Roper and Gallup have given their blessing . Because private U.S. polls sometimes disagree and often are challenged , he hopes his Center may become a sort of Audit Bureau of Polls ( like the press 's Audit Bureau of Circulations ) . The Center will have a national staff of interviewers and a group of scholars at headquarters constantly studying results . Chief polling problems to be worked on , Field believes , are 1 ) more scientific wording of questions , 2 ) a method of measuring how strongly people feel on a given question . As an example of polls ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and FORTUNE polls on whether the U.S. people favor sending an air force to Europe . Gallup said 24% were in favor , FORTUNE , 35.5% . Field 's explanation : the Gallup question was loaded with the phrase : " to help the British . "
