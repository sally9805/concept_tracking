Radio last week pulled off a whacking satire on the violence done the music of Peter Ilich Tchaikovsky by popular composers . The Celebrity Theater ( Blue , 8-8:30 p.m . E.W.T. , Thursdays ) presented " Deep in the Heart of Tchaikovsky . " Bandleader Freddy Martin , whose arrangement of Tchaikovsky 's Piano Concerto was a juke-box perennial as " Concerto for Two , " played the role of the Russian composer . <P> The plot : Tchaikovsky comes to Tin Pan Alley , tries to sell his works , is accused of stealing from Freddy Martin , Larry Clinton , Andre Kostelanetz and Mack David-all of whom are indebted to the Slav for top tunes . Discouraged be cause Variety will never say " Tchaikovsky Pop Hits Top , " he mopes toward suicide . <P> But Beethoven dissuades him , rates him roundly for self-indulgence ( " You and your Pathtique Symphony ! " ) . Tchaikovsky tries again and comes up with a smash hit-a jive version of the opening theme of Beethoven 's Fifth .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
