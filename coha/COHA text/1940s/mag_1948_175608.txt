For Barbara Ann Scott , one " P.B. , " writing in the obscure Le Bonheur of Trois Rivires , Que. , had kind words : " I am ready to believe that this young girl is a model of virtue , modesty , discretion and grace . " But for Barbara Ann 's clothes and capers , and for figure-skating in general , fuddy-duddy " P.B. " had only scorn . Last week L'Action Catholique , official mouthpiece of Quebec 's Roman Catholic archdiocese , picked up his words , gave them wide ( circ. 83,000 ) circulation : <P> " To do figure-skating , is it really necessary for girls to uncover their legs completely ? . . . The costumes generally worn by most girl skaters are frankly indecent . <P> " Certain provocative postures accentuate still more the indecency . . . especially ... a certain posture ( pardon the comparison ! ) which brings to mind a posture that dogs often use . These ladies seem to think it impossible to skate gracefully without lifting a leg as high as possible . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ready to turn professional . Last week in South Porcupine , Ont. , she said " I 'm ready to listen to offers , but there is nothing definite yet . "
