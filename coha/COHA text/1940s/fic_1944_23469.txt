Wallace Stegner , the distinguished novelist , was in Mexico last winter . This story is the record of what he saw and felt on a visit to Paricutin . THE VOLCANO A- story WALLACE STEGNER 0 NCE they had turned off the asphalt onto the rough graded road the driver nursed the car along carefully , creeping across bridges and through arroyos and along rocky stretches . While lighting a cigarette he explained to his American passenger . " It is a car which cost seven thousand pesos , " he said . " One does not treat it as if it were a burro . " " Truly , " the American said . " Partly it is the tires , " the driver said . " Tires one can not buy without paying too much to those who sell them illegally. , But partly it is the engine . In the dust an engine suffers . " " I believe it , " the American said politely . He was watching out the closed window , seeing how the ash had deepened in the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounded with it , and how the pines , growing thickly on the sides of the countless little volcanic hills , rose listless and gray out of a gray blanket as smooth as new snow and as light under the wind as feathers . Across the west the cloud of smoke was blacker and angrier , funneling down so that its compact lower plume was hidden behind the hills . The sun , at the upper edge of the cloud , was an immense golden orange . A horn blatted behind them , and the driver pulled half off the road . A carwent by them fast , pouring back a choking , impenetrable fog of dust . The driver stopped philosophically to let it blow away before he started again . " Loco , " he said . " That one has no respect either for his passengers or his engine . " The American did not answer . He was leaning back in the seat watching the blasted country outside . Occasionally they crept past adobe huts half buried in the ash , their corrals drifted deep , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corn and beans stretching away on both sides without a track to break their even , slaty gray . He thought of the little animals that had lived in these woods , and whether they had got out before the ash became deep , or had quietly smothered in their holes . A wildcat might make headway through it , perhaps , but not the smaller things , the mice and rabbits and lizards , and it was the small things that one thought of . " What has become of the people from here ? " he asked . The driver half turned . Some , he said , had gone , many to the United States , being taken away in busses and trains to work as braceros in the fields of Arizona and California . " Where they will be cheated and abused , " the American said . " What of those who stay ? " " I will show you one , " the driver said . A little further on he pointed to a gray but under the ash-laden shelter of the pines , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw a woman standing in the door , her rebozo wrapped across her face , and back of her the cavelike interior and the gleam of a charcoal fire . " Some , like that one , will not leave , " the driver said . " The governor 's men have been here and urged them , but they are foolish . It is where they were born ; they do not want to leave . " " But what do they live on ? They ca n't grow anything here . " " There are those who cut wood , " the driver said . " Though the trees are dying , they are a thing that can be saved . Others , in San Juan , rent horses and burros for the trip to the boca . That one , she has nothing . She will die . " The road turned , and the American lost sight of the but and the still woman in the doorway . Somehow , though the windows were tight shut and the motor and the punished springs filled the car with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They curved left along a ridge and dropped into a valley , and the volcano was directly ahead of them , not more than two miles away . From its vent monstrous puffs of black smoke mushroomed upward , were whipped ragged by the wind , belched up again . The side of the cone , looking as straight at that distance as if drawn with a ruler , ran down into a curving lava stream that stopped in a broken wall two hundred yards short of the road . The west side of the cone was lost in smoke . The driver stopped and pointed . Under the lava , he said , was the village of Paricutin . It was not possible to walk across the lava yet , because it had not cooled completely and there were poisonous fumes , but this was a good place to watch from , with the wind the way it was . " In San Juan it will be dirty , " he said . " One will not be able to see much for the smoke . " " The horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time every afternoon . " " And there are people in San Juan still ? " " Si . " " Vamanos , " the American said . " If we wish we can come back here later . " He sat forward in the seat , watching the volcano throw up its gobbets of smoke . Through and behind the smoke , like distant flying specks , he could see the rocks and boulders that were thrown up and fell swiftly again . " This trip by horse , " he said . " What is it like ? " " It is something to be remembered , " the driver said . " One goes up in daylight , but on the return it is very dark , so dark that one can not see the horse 's ears . And behind , as one comes down this black trail that one knew a year ago as a cornfield , is always this noise and this glare on the sky as if hell were open . " He took his hand off the wheel and raised it over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind , " he said . " It is like fleeing the end of the world . " " You could wait for me if I went up ? " " Why not ? " the driver said . " It is an experience . ' ! . rr HEY passed a. corral , a hut , a clutter of sheds , another corral , its gates hanging open under a gray drift . Then the houses closed in suddenly and they were in a street . In the perpetual twilight of this town of San Juan men and women , wrapped to the eyes in rebozos and serapes , their bare feet gray and silent in the ashes , walked along under the overhang of thatch , and children leaned against the walls , only their eyes showing under the sombrero rims , and watched the car pass . In the plaza three busses and a half-dozen cars were parked . Only when the motor was cut did the American realize that the silence he had been constantly aware of outside had given place to a thin , gritty patter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here it rains cinders , " he said . " It is necessary to keep the head well covered , and something over the mouth and nose . " He tied a bandanna across his face and climbed out . " I shall see about these horses , " he said . The American waited . On the far side of the plaza a group of Americans , men and women , were already mounting . In odd mismatched clothes , suit trousers and leather jackets and sombreros and bandannas , the women in riding breeches or levis , all of them with their faces muffled , they looked like members of a comic opera outlaw gang . The driver was having a conference with two Mexicans who were adjusting stirrups for the women . After five minutes he came back . " It is a pity , " he said . " This crowd which is to go immediately has taken all the horses available . " " It is not important , " the American said . " Actually I am not so interested in the insides of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pulled down his hat , and stepped out into the feathery ash . The air was thick with smoke , and cinders pattered on his hat and shoulders . He slitted his eyes against the gritty rain . " If you would like me to show you around ? " the driver said . " It is not necessary , " the American said . He went poking off up a street that opened on the plaza , his nose filled with the odor that he realized he had been smelling for some time , a sour , acrid , vinegarish odor like fresh sawn oak . He saw many people , shrouded and silent , but they did not break the stillness in which the falling cinders whispered dryly . Even the handkerchief-muffled calls of the Americans riding off toward the crater , and the tooting of the bus horns in farewell , came through the air as through a thick pillow , and he did not hear his own footsteps in the dust . Once , as he walked past a doorway into which a trail led through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let go and avalanched behind him . He turned to see the last runnels trickling from the thatch , and two little Indian girls , each with a small baby hung over her back in the looped rebozo , came out of the doorway and waded experimentally in the knee-deep powder . The end of the street trailed off into ashen fields , and for a moment the American stood in the unnatural gray dusk looking across toward the cone of Paricutin under its lowering cloud of smoke . At intervals of about a minute there was a grumble like far-off blasting , but because of the smoke which blew directly over the town he could not see the rocks flying up . The cinders were an insistent , sibilant rain on his head and shoulders , and his mouth was bitter with the vinegarish taste . It was not a place he liked . The village of Parieutin , on the other side , had been buried completely under the lava . That was death both definite and sudden . But this slow death that fell like light rain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holes of the little animals and mounded the roofs and choked the streets , this dying village through which ghosts went in silence , was something else . It was a thing Mexicans had always known , in one form or another , else there would not be in so many of their paintings the figure of the robed skeleton , the walking Death . They were patient under it , they accepted it -- but the American did not like to remember how alive the eyes of the Indian girls had been as they waded through the ashes with their little sisters on their backs . On the way back to the plaza he met a pig that wandered in from a side street . The pig looked at him , wrinkling its snout . Its bristly back was floured with gray ash , and its eyes were red . It grunted softly , querulously , and put its snout to the ground , rooted without hope in the foot-deep powder , walked a few steps with its nose plowing the dry and unprofitable dust . The American left it and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came from the bus where he had been gossiping . " Let 's go , " the American said . " Perhaps where we stopped first it is clearer . " They went back through the choked streets , leaving the silent Indians who moved softly as shadows through the dead town and the hog which rooted without hope in the ashes , and pulled off the road in deep ash at the end of the valley . For a few minutes they sat , talking desultorily in polite Spanish and watching the irregular spouting of the cone , opening the windows so that they could hear the ominous low grumble and the faint clatter of falling rocks . The cone was blue-black now , and the lava bed across the foreground was a somber , smoking cliff . It was a landscape without shadows , submerged in gray twilight . " I have conceived a great hatred for this thing , " the American said finally . " It is a thing I have always known and always hated . It is something which kills . " " Truly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as those who arc in the war must feel the war . " " Yes , " the American said . " You have friends in the war ? " " Sons , " the American said . " One is now a prisoner in Germany . " " Ai , " the driver said , with sympathy . He hesitated a minute , as if hunting for the correct thing to say to one whose sons were captives of the enemy . " You hear from him ? " he said . " How does he endure his captivity ? " " How does one endure anything ? " the American said . " I suppose he hates it and endures it , that is an . " He looked out the window , raised his shoulders . " I have heard once only , " he said for politeness ' sake . PIRHEY looked across the gray waste that A had once been a mi/pa , toward the smoking front of the lava bed . The light had changed . It was darker , more threatening , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was almost as black as night , but across the field spread a steely dusk that rendered every object sharp-edged and distinct . The American raised his head and looked at the ceiling of the car . The stealthy , light fingering had begun there . " You see ? " he said . " That is what I mean . It is something which follows . It is like a doom . " The driver made a deprecating gesture . " The wind has shifted , " he said . " It always shifts , " the American said . He stepped out of the car and stood shin-deep in the gray death , listening to the stealthy whisper and the silence that lay over and under and around . The crater rumbled far off , and boulders fell back with a distant clatter , but the silence still hung like something tangible over the valley . As he watched , the heavy dusk lightened , and he looked up . By a freak of wind the smoke had been blown high , and though no sign of the setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinkish wash of light came through under the cloud and let an unearthly illumination over the field of ash and the smoking cliff of lava . Into that lurid dusk an Indian in white pajamas , with a bundle of wood on his back and an axe across his shoulder , came out of the pines at the upper edge of the lava and walked along the clifflike front . Little puffs of dust rose from under his feet . After him , fifteen yards behind , came another , and after him another . The three strung out across the field , walking as silently in the rosy , metallic light as dream figures . The ones behind did not try to close the gap and walk companionably with the one ahead ; the one ahead did not wait for them . They walked in single file , fifteen yards apart , each with his burden of wood on his back , and the little puffs of dust rose under their feet and the punched-hole tracks lengthened behind them across the field . The American watched them , feeling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loads upon their backs , and as he watched he heard the man ahead whistle a brief snatch of tune , drop it , start something else . He went whistling , a ghost in a dead land , toward some but half buried in ash where a charcoal fire would be burning , and his wife would have ready for him tortillas and beans , with cinders in them , perhaps , like everything else , but still tortillas and beans that would fill a man 's belly against the work that must be done tomorrow . The American watched the three until they were out of sight around the shoulder of the hill . When he climbed into the car and motioned for the driver to start back he was not thinking of the steady smothering fall of the cinders or the death that lay over the streets and cornfields of San Juan . He was thinking of the eyes of the little Indian girls , which were so very alive above the muffling rebozos . " It is a strange thing , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ignition key , shrugged and smiled . " Why not ? " he said . " The mouth is not made merely to spit with or curse with . At times it may be used for whistling , or even for kissing , verdad ? " .
