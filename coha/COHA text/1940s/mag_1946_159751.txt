" They 're saying I 'm a wild man . If I turn the trick , they 'll say I 'm a genius . " <P> So said Royal Little , the mild , 50-year-old president of Textron Inc. , whose unconventional production ideas have built a textile empire in less than three years . Last week Wildman Little did turn a trick . He paid $12 million to Benjamin Brown Gossett for his mills in Charlotte , N.C. and Anderson , S.C. , thus adding twelve southern mills to Textron 's 13 in New England , and more than doubling Textron 's cotton and rayon capacity . But Little still has to perform his main trick-making Textron the most integrated and most profitable U.S. textile company . <P> For over a hundred years it has been customary for each textile mill to specialize in a single process only . One mill would spin , another weave , etc . But when Little established Textron 's parent company ( Special Yarns Corp. ) on $10,000 capital in 1923 , he had different ideas . He believed that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer , should be under one management . <P> Test a Theory . For years , Little 's theories had to wait upon the practical necessity of keeping Special Yarns out of the red . Then the war came . Little found himself busy on war work ( parachutes , jungle hammocks , etc. ) until the Army suddenly began to cancel contracts in 1943 . Carefully Royal Little weighed his chances , decided not to curtail production but to reconvert , expand and integrate . <P> Under the name of Textron Inc. , his company began retailing its first civilian goods in August 1943 , through department stores and other selected outlets . This proved highly profitable . Furthermore , Textron , a new producer , got a better break on price ceilings than oldline textile companies . The $5 million worth of consumer products made in 1944 were increased last year to $16 million . Nevertheless , Textron 's 1945 balance sheet showed a deficit ( $147,000 ) , in spite of individual profits by subsidiaries which it acquired . Reason : earnings went partly to former owners ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them on the market . <P> Today , Textron is integrated from raw yarn to finished product ; it covers the field of house furnishings and clothing , employs its own designers , chooses its own retail outlets . And Little talks about a $100 million gross next year . <P> Set Up Trusts . Another Little innovation is his policy of setting up nonprofit foundations which purchase his textile mills , or getting outside foundations to buy them . The foundations then lease the mills back to Textron . Example : the Rhode Island Charities Trust owns the Manville Mills and leases them to Textron at $210,000 a year . The U.S. Treasury , always suspicious of any unorthodox financial practices which seem to benefit a corporation taxwise , looked over Textron-connected foundations , dropped the matter . Little 's own explanation is that he would rather help charitable foundations while he 's alive than will them money .
