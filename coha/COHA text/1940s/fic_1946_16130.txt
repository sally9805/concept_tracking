This ledge forms a counter over which customers , from the newstand on the outside , are able to pay Potter without entering the store . Occasionally Potter opens the window which pulls down onto the counter to complete a deal with a customer . He wears a white coat and starched collar . His cash register is within reach .

Rankin stoops quickly and picks up the Bible where it fell from Meinike 's hand . Tearing pages from it , he runs in a wide arc , establishing a new trail to carry the chase away from Meinike 's body . Out of breath , he returns to stand guard .

They look like other people and act like them - when it 's to their interest . Wilson touches the switch . The picture is thrown on the screen . It is a newsreel of a concentration camp .

The film continues , though Wilson no longer pays any attention to it . His concern is with Mary .  --  107  --  &nbsp; WILSONIt was Kindler who conceived the theory of mass depopulation of conquered countries , so that regardless of who won the war , Germany would emerge the strongest nation in western Europe , biologically speaking .

In prison in Czechoslovakia , a war criminal was awaiting execution . This was Meinike , one-time executive officer of Franz Kindler . He was an obscenity on the face of the earth . The smell of burning flesh was in his clothes . We gave him his freedom on the chance that he might lead me to Kindler . He led me here , Mrs. Rankin . And here , I lost him . . . . until yesterday .

That person is the one who knows . . . knows positively . . . who Meinike came to Harper to see . The last frames of film run through the projector and the loose end flaps monotonously against the still turning reel . The bright light shines full on the screen .

( he is still clinging perilously to the last rung of the ladder ) " You wo n't fall , you wo n't fall - fall - fall " CAMERA moves in on Rankin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of his eyes fills the screen , monstrously . . . . &nbsp; RANKIN 'S VOICE " Failing to speak . . . you became part of the crime . . . With these hands . The same hands that have held you close to me . . . The hands stand for progress , which would not occur by fits and starts but according to the laws of harmonic motion . " ( By this time Rankin 's eye is so large that only the pupil remains , filling the screen and at these last words the eye changes queerly into the face of the clock . The music is heavy with the rhythmic grinding of the works - The shadow of the iron demon falls over the screen and now we commence to hear distinctly and strangely the tolling of the clock . ) &nbsp; RANKIN 'S VOICE ( through this ) " My first impression of Harper was the incongruity of a Gothic clock in a Connecticut church tower . . . " ( Here comes the transition from Mary 's dream to actuality . The music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceiling of Mary 's bedroom . Rankin 's voice continues. )  --  148  --  255 INT . MARY 's BEDROOM - NIGHT The CAMERA , angled on the ceiling , shows a macabre pattern of moonlight . The grimacing demon is really the twisted shadow of a tree outside the window . &nbsp; RANKIN 'S VOICE " It 's beautiful that way . . . . . Beautiful . . . . " The CAMERA moves down off the ceiling showing the curtains of the bedroom blowing in the night breeze , and then , Mary 's feverish face which fills the screen in the foreground . Her eyes are opened . This is the same moment in which we discovered her in the introduction of the picture . She is counting the hour as the clock tolls it and she winces at the sound . It is as vivid a reminder of Rankin as his own voice would be . Very softly now , under the real sound of the distant clock , his voice goes on and Mary , listening to it , is taken back to their first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Music suggests this weirdly ) . . . . &nbsp; RANKIN 'S VOICE " My favorite walk . . . through the cemetery . . . over the little brook . . . and then the woods . . . .

WILSON 'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT Wilson is seated by the window looking out at the clock tower . He is talking on the phone . &nbsp; WILSON ( quietly - easily ) Yes . . . road-blocks are up - we 're watching the railroad station and he is n't hiding in the woods . . . ( there is a sharp knock on the door ) &nbsp; NOAH ( offscene - very excitedly ) Mr. Wilson ! ! &nbsp; WILSONCome in !

Samuels , and the deputies ! Get all the help you can ! 266 INT . HALLWAY IN THE HOTEL Wilson racing toward the stairs goes past the CAMERA . We hear his footsteps offscreen as Noah in the door calls after him . &nbsp; NOAHWhere , Mr. Wilson ? Where ! ? Offscreen Wilson cries out in pain and we hear the sound of him taking a bad fall on the stairs . Noah reacts and dashes down the stairway , CAMERA following . Wilson is in a heap near the foot of the stairs . He has sprained his ankle . &nbsp; NOAHMr . Wilson !

DISSOLVE TO : Section Details 267 INT . VESTIBULE - NIGHT Mary , package under her arm , begins mounting towards the belfry . CAMERA stays on her as she climbs into the belfry . She sees the ladder with its missing section . Clutching her package under one arm , with her free hand she grasps the one still standing upright and mounts the first rung . RANKIN 'S VOICE comes out of the darkness . &nbsp; RANKIN 'S VOICEDo n't move . I have a gun . 268 CLOSE SHOT - MARY She stands rigid on the first rung . &nbsp; MARY ( quietly ) You do n't need it . I 'm alone . &nbsp; RANKIN 'S VOICE ( incredulously ) What are you doing here ? &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was afraid you would be hungry . 269 INT . LANDING - NIGHT Rankin stands in the deep shadows beside the door leading into the clock room itself . His face , haggard and unshaven , betrays his incredulity . Can it be possible that he still holds this girl . &nbsp; RANKINAre you telling the truth ? &nbsp; MARY 'S VOICEWhy should I lie ? He moves forward and looks down at her . 270 INT . LANDING - NIGHT Rankin is in immediate foreground , with Mary below him , looking up . Below her there is a bottomless pit .  --  153  --  &nbsp; RANKINWere you followed here ? &nbsp; MARYI came past the woods . . . across the brook . . . through the cemetery . No one saw me. 271 INT .

He follows . 273 INT . CLOCK ROOM - NIGHT The old lantern hangs from a cross beam . A burlap bag screens the window to hide its rays . Rankin closes the door . The rhythm of the clock 's motor is loud in their ears as they face each other . Finally : &nbsp; RANKIN ( his hand outstretched ) Give me the food . Silently , she hands him the package . She watches him as he tears the paper , revealing a shoe box . He jerks off the lid . He is staring down at emptiness . He looks up at her slowly . &nbsp; MARY ( quietly ) I needed the excuse . I was afraid you would n't let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? &nbsp; MARYI came to kill you . &nbsp; RANKINWhat a little fool you are . Coming here alone . . . still meddling . . . . You 've forced me .

Everyone knows you 've been on the verge of cracking up . Now , you 've cracked . Why else would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church in the dead of night . . . climb to an empty clock tower . Any child could see you 'd wind up killing yourself . He is interrupted by the sudden slamming of the clock tower door . WILSON STANDS BEFORE HIM . A gun appears in Rankin 's hand . &nbsp; WILSON ( sweating with pain , but his tone cool and final ) Killing has led you here . It wo n't help you now .  --  155  --  OVER SCENE there rises the sound of voices . &nbsp; WILSON ( Cont 'd ) The citizens of Harper , Kuhn . They 're waiting for you . ( Rankin retreats two steps ) You can kill me . . . Mary . . . half of Harper . And still there 's no escape . You had the world and it closed in on you till there was only Harper . That closed in and then there was only this room . And this room , too , is closing in . . . . Rankin 's face has again been stripped of all expression ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilson 's indictment sinks into him , a faint moistness appears on his lips . His eyes come alive , crazed , frenetic . Suddenly he is slobbering . &nbsp; RANKINIt 's not true . What they say . I did n't do it . It was their idea . I only followed orders . &nbsp; WILSONYou gave the orders . &nbsp; RANKINI only did my duty . ( pleading ) Do n't make me face them . I ca n't go back . I 'm not a criminal . &nbsp; MARYYou are . . .

Wilson stumbles , gasping with pain , and falls . The gun flies across the room . It lands at Mary 's feet . She snatches it up . Her hand is steady as she faces him .  --  156  --  &nbsp; RANKIN ( screaming ) Do n't . I ca n't die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins striking the half hour . . . loud . . . strident . Wilson , in dreadful agony , crawls toward Rankin . &nbsp; RANKIN ( his voice rising over the clamor ) It 's my monument . After two hundred years . It runs . . . . because of me . He reaches the window . His knees buckle over the ledge . His arms flail the air wildly as he seeks something to which he can cling . He disappears from sight . pp. 117-135 &nbsp; pp. 157-158 274 EXT . CLOCK TOWER - NIGHT Rankin has fallen onto the thin ledge beneath the clock . He scrambles to his feet . . . looks around wildly for an avenue of escape . The demon passes him in its rotary motion across the clock , almost knocking him off the ledge .

OVER SCENE there rises the piercing scream heard in the opening of the picture , then Rankin emerges , carried impaled upon the Angel 's sword . 275 EXT . TOWN SQUARE - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the opening of the picture , all eyes turned upward toward the face of the clock . 276 EXT . CLOCK TOWER - NIGHT The CAMERA , shooting from a high elevation , carries a section of the clock in f.g. , the ledge blocking the view of a section of the street below . Beyond the ledge , townspeople can be seen running across the green . The Angel has almost completed its march across the clock . Rankin , impaled upon its sword , is struggling to free himself . Just before the Angel reaches its exit , his last struggles dislodge the Angel from its base with a shriek of tortured metal . Within the clock itself there is a wild grinding of gears suddenly released and the hands of the clock spin wildly as the Angel and Rankin , locked in a gruesome embrace , veer slowly out and fall to the street below , out of CAMERA range . As they fall , the townspeople on the green  --  157  --  below can be seen hastily pulling back as the bodies hurtle toward them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clock , still wildly spinning , squeak and rattle as the works clatter to a stop . 277 EXT .
