Kalamazoo , you ai n't in a class by yourself ; <P> I seen you before in a lot of places . <P> Last week another visitor to Kalamazoo ( pop . 54,097 ) expressed Poet Carl Sandburg 's sentiment even more succinctly . He was 16-year-old Herbert Flam , cocky Crown Prince of Tennis . After looking over the field in the National Junior Championships , he said : " I 've seen better . " <P> Kalamazoo could be reasonably sure that young Herbert from Beverly Hills was talking about his opposition and not the tennis-conscious Michigan city or Kalamazoo College 's high-class courts . He had played there twice before , capturing the <P> Boys ' Championship in ' 43 and reaching the Junior semifinals in ' 44 . Perhaps he was impressed by the absence of Air Cadet Bob Falkenburg , whose crashing play highlighted the two previous visits . <P> Although Flam 's 133 Ibs. on a wiry 5-ft. - 9- in. frame supply no overwhelming power , he is a sharp hitter who makes a habit of nonchalantly retrieving his opponents ' put-away shots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craftily angled returns . His service is on the weak side , but he has developed a strong specialty-a deft lob with a mean spin . <P> In the " Kazoo " finals it came in handy against Southpaw Bernard ( " Tut " ) Bartzen , runner-up to Falkenburg last year . Tut learned to play the game by going up against a bangboard daily in the little Texas town of San Angelo , where competition was nonexistent , so he was used to seeing his best efforts returned . Flam 's disconcerting returns earned him the title at 6-3 , 6-4 , 6-4.
