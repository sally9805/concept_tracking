The homesick love of country now felt by millions of servicemen and women overseas has rarely been better expressed than in this poem by a veteran of World War I. Malcolm Cowley , a member of the " lost generation " of U.S. writers who expatriated themselves in Europe after that war , came home to become one of the nation 's most influential literary critics . He wrote this poem , which first appeared in Poetry and has since been reprinted in Mr. Cowley 's own The Dry Season and in several anthologies , while returning from Spain in 1937 . <P> THE LONG VOYAGE <P> Not that the pines were darker , there , <P> nor midmay dogwood brighter there , <P> nor swifts more swift in summer air ; <P> it was my own country , <P> having its thunderclap of spring , <P> its long midsummer ripening , <P> its corn hoar-stiff at harvesting , <P> almost like any country , <P> yet being mine , its face , its speech , <P> its hills bent low within my reach , <P> its river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own country . <P> Now the dark waters at the bow <P> fold back , like earth against the plow ; <P> foam brightens like the dogwood now <P> at home , in my own country .
