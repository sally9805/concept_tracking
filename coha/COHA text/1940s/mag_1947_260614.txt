There were only eleven students ; if they could find a twelfth , they could buy their dancing lessons cheaper . They descended on a pint-sized teen-ager backstage in a Dresden theater who had hopes of becoming a stage designer . How would he like to study under Dancer Mary Wigman , the new rage of Europe ? He was willing : Before long , Harald Kreutzberg was the prize of the lot . <P> Last week , Manhattan 's dancers and dance fans-from nightclub whirlers to classic ballerinas-turned out to see the shiny-pated , lithe little fellow whom most of them consider the greatest male dancer since Nijinsky . It had been ten years since Kreutzberg had danced in the U.S. , but at 44 he was still as mobile of face , and as agile of step and gifted of satire as ever . He is one of the few dancers alive who , with no company of dancers to surround him , no scenery to set him off , and only a piano to accompany him , could command the attention of a sellout audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . <P> Kreutzberg 's first big success-and his last haircut-came in 1925 when he danced a dramatic part in the ballet Don Morte , based on a story by Edgar Allan Poe . Says Kreutzberg : " I wanted to look very dreary . I tried a mask , then a cap , but that made me look unreal . It was summertime , so I shaved my head . The ballet girls said my make-up looked wonderful , then touched my head and shrieked . " His next role was that of a bald Chinese . He has kept his head shaved ever since ; when his dances require it , he wears masks or wigs which he designs himself . During the war , Kreutzberg danced a few recitals in his native Austria , but mainly , he says , tried to keep out of sight : " I just appeared , then disappeared . " The Germans finally put him in uniform-he spent a year swabbing hospital floors in Italy . When he saw a chance , he fled , and surrendered to the U.S. Army . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He feels he has lost time to make up , and a good many things yet to say in his character dancing . Says Kreutzberg : " I am a very sad person , a very funny person , and a very silly person . And they all want to speak . "
