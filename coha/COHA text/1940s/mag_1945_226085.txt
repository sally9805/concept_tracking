France 's political " big three " - Communists , Socialists and Popular Republicans ( M.R.P. ) - entered the Fourth Republic . Latest returns for the newly elected Constituent Assembly indicated that the Communists controlled 162 seats , Socialists 154 , and M.R.P. 138 . In popular ballots the big three had run neck &; neck : each polling about 4,500,000 . The so-called Right had been reduced to 80 seats , about 2,000,000 popular votes . The wartime resistance movement was all but obliterated as a political entity . Frenchwomen , after casting their first national vote , held 31 Assembly seats , or 5% of the total. * <P> Three days after the election , Provisional President Charles de Gaulle summoned party leaders to consultation . His objective : a coalition cabinet , which will administer France , while the Assembly , beginning Nov. 6 , drafts the new constitution . This will be the Assembly 's primary job , and it has seven months to finish the task . <P> The M.R.P. was first to confer with the General . A newcomer , it had astonished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its leadership , typified by Foreign Minister Georges Bidault , was dominated by preliberation Gaullists . In its liberal though Catholic outlook it stood close to the General 's views . <P> Now , through youthful ( 34 ) , energetic Chairman Maurice Schumann , the M.R.P. declared its willingness to take part in a coalition government . But it laid down conditions : 1 ) General de Gaulle must be chief of the new government , 2 ) the new government must adopt a program of " economic democracy . " <P> The Socialists , next to talk with De Gaulle , announced that they were ready to join hands with " all republicans . " Condition : the coalition government must agree on " minimum " economic reforms . <P> The Communists , now France 's most powerful party , were third in line . They also were ready-even anxious-to enter a coalition government . But they had an important , characteristic condition : the Communists must have cabinet " posts of an " importance reflecting the party 's great victory at the polls . " A spokesman explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Interior ( police ) and Information . General de Gaulle was not likely to meet this demand . The Communists were likely to settle for less . If they did not , the General might carry on with a Socialist-M.R.P. cabinet , leaving the Communists in powerful opposition . On foreign policy the Socialists and M.R.P. championed and Communists naturally opposed a western bloc . Socialists and M.R.P. differed over state aid for parochial schools-an important issue in Catholic France . But they agreed on the great fundamental : a program of middleway socialism . The Communists said that they agreed , too . <P> <P> *After 25 years of suffrage , U.S. women hold only 2% of the 435 seats in the House of Representatives , none in the Senate .
