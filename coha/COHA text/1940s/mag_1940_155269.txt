It was late-4:19 p.m. - before Prime Minister Churchill retired at the end of the question period . He had put the House of Commons in a gay mood by his deft handling of tricky questions . As the speaker left the chair , the sergeant at arms , dressed in court black , advanced solemnly up the aisle , removed the mace from the table , and set it in the bracket underneath . This put the House " in committee of the Whole House , " ready to consider any bill concerned with money . <P> Up from the Treasury bench rose round , pink-faced Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir Kingsley Wood-known to the House as " The Cherub . " In a clear tenor voice he piped : " What I want is cash . " And for the next 91 minutes , speaking from notes written in his own hand , taped up in little bundles , one for each phase of his speech , he presented Great Britain with the heaviest budget in her history . <P> Sir Kingsley made some staggering demands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now Viscount ) John Simon , he added expenditures of 800,000,000 , so that total outlay for the year was estimated at 3,467,000,000-more than half the entire annual peacetime national income . Against this he presented plans for new revenues of only 239,000,000 , hardly 30% of the increase in expenditure and just about enough to pay for one month of warfare . To get this new income , Sir Kingsley was obliged to ask for new taxes , both direct and hidden . Basic rate for income tax rose from 37% to 42% . Sir Kingsley proposed that taxes should be collected at the source-by deductions from weekly payrolls . New sales taxes on luxuries-jewels , furs , fancy hats , silk ties-were set at 24% ; and on humble necessities-clothing , shoes , pots , brooms , newspapers , books-at 12% . <P> In all this , said Sir Kingsley , he was regretfully obliged to hit the little man . There were just not enough big men left . He pointed out that incomes in excess of the equivalent of $80,000 were taxed 90% , leaving only $8,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excess of $8,000 , he said , all he would get would be $280,000,000- enough to keep the war going not quite nine days .
