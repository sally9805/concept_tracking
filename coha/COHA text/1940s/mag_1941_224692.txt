At 6:15 of a February morning , the wind whistles off the snow and ice of the Flatbush meadows . The barracks at Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn , windows open , are very , very cold . And cold seems the heart of Sergeant Earl Sanborn , USMC , who on the dot of 6:15 clumps into the bunk room in his undershirt , pipes two shrill blasts on his whistle , bellows : " Hit the deck ! " <P> Thus starts the day for some 40 of the Navy 's fledgling fliers . At 13 Naval Reserve Aviation Bases , strung across the U. S. from Opa Locka , Fla. to Oakland , Calif. , the day starts in similar fashion for 380 young men , serving a 30-day apprenticeship for flight training . <P> Sleepily squirming into their warm flight jackets , the students straggle below for a muster . A quarter-mile run around the barracks gives them an eye-opener before they shave , make up their double-decker bunks , sit down to a hearty breakfast served up by corpulent civilian Concessionaire Moe Greenspan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their stomachs with 80 pounds of food a day , hears more complaints about the chow than a Congressman . By 7:45 they are pushing their yellow biplane trainers out of the hangars for the day 's flying . It is still very , very cold as they start the motors , and they shiver and mutter as they catch the blast from the props . <P> During the day the student pilots have an hour of instruction in flying , an hour in sending and receiving International Morse Code by radio , an hour on other ground-school work-getting acquainted with aircraft and engines , tinkering with the mechanism of a Browning .30-calibre machine gun which they have to learn to take apart and put together , naming 95 separate parts . The rest of the time until they are secured ( released ) for the day at 4:30 , they spend working on the starting line , getting the ships off , gassing them every two hours , wiping them shiny again at the end of the day . <P> Purpose of this routine : to weed out the impossibles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or at the Navy 's two new training bases at Jacksonville and Corpus Christi . Since it costs the Navy some $15,000 to educate a pilot for officer duty with the fleet , it pays the Navy to pick &; choose . <P> Essential prerequisites for naval aviation training are two years of college credits ( " or the equivalent " ) , three letters of recommendation , an age between 20 and 27 . Next comes a stiff physical examination ( with emphasis on eyes and heart ) on which about 50% are turned down . A successful applicant becomes one of the flying cadets now enlisted as seamen second class for elimination flight training . During the first month he gets ten hours of flight instruction . If he manages to solo , he gets a crack at advanced training and a commission on graduation ( but with Jacksonville and Corpus Christi still abuilding , there is a two-to-three-month wait ) . <P> With Navy expansion galloping full speed , there is hope of an air force of 17,000 pilots to fly the contemplated 15 , - ooo planes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out last year , the 6,720 expected this year . Already the elimination classes are being hiked from 40 to 100 a month . Before the first month is over , perhaps 20% will be washed out as unsuitable for further training .
