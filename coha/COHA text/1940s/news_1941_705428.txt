txt BUS PARLEYS ENDED AS MEDIATORS FAIL TO BREAK DEADLOCK Mayor Urges Men to Return and Accept Arbitration of the Strike Issues UNION CUTS ITS DEMANDS Annual Rise Asked Is Scaled to $1,000,000 ? Tower ' Must Now Decide , Says Meyer The combined efforts of Mayor La Guardia and Arthur S. Meyer , chairman of the State Board of Mediation , to settle the bus strike at the conference table collapsed at 6:30 o'clock last night , leaving the dispute to be settled , in the words of Mr. Meyer , " by power instead of by reason . " The State mediator , who flew from Florida on Wednesday at the Mayor 's request to try to reconcile the demands of the 3,500 strikers , as voiced by the Transport Workers Union . C. L 0 . affiliate , with the counter-proposals of the Fifth Avenue Coach Company and the New York City Omnibus Corporation , said that he was convinced that there was nothing to be gained by further attempts at conciliation . The union 's last offer before mediation was abandoned involved a decrease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional $3,250,000 annually to $1,000 , - 000 . Throughout the conferences , according to Mr. Meyer , the union refused to submit the controversy to arbitration . A statement issued by the union said that its demands upon the New York City Omnibus Corporation were cut from $2,000,000 to $750,000 , and those upon the Fifth Avenue Coach Company from $1,243,000 to $250,000 . The discussion of these demands was on the basis of increased annual costs to the companies and did not touch on the allocation of specific sums to separate items in the demands , such as the 25 per cent general wage rise . The company , rejecting the union 's proposal , which was based on resumption of direct negotiations for new contracts , offered to submit all issues to arbitration as to both companies or , in the alternative , to withdraw its counterproposals as to both companies , provided the union agreed to renew the expired contract with the Fifth Avenue Coach Company and to submit to arbitration its demands with respect to the New York City Omnibus Corporation . The union rejected this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of efforts to mediate the dispute , Mayor La Guardia issued a statement appealing to the strikers to accept arbitration and return to work immediately . The statement criticized the union 's leaders for having refused , for the third time since the strike was voted last Friday , to submit its case to arbitration . The Mayor 's statement , telephoned by him to City Hall and made public there at 6:45 P. M. , follows : " I have just been informed by Mr. Arthur Meyer that negotiations and mediation between the bus companies and the Transport Workers Union have broken off . I am so sorry that all the efforts made to bring the leaders to reason have been useless . It seems to me that negotiations having been broken , the arbitration offered is the only way of settling the mattsr . " This is the third time arbitration has been offered by the companies . I strongly recommend to the men that they return to work and accept arbitration . That is the American way of settling disputes after negotiations have failed . " It must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the present contract were offered pending an arbitration award . " Meyer Gives Up Efforts Announcement of the collapse of the negotiations was made by Mr. Meyer at his office , 250 West Fiftyseventh Street , where he had conferred with spokesmen for the companies and the union since 11 A. M. , except for a brief visit to City Hall to report to Mayor La Guardia during the afternoon . Before the stalemate was reached , the negotiating committee for the bus men , consisting of fourteen section captains who took part in the conferences , voted unanimously to reject the companies ' proposals . Mr. Meyer 's statement follows : " After having explored all possibilities fully and worked with both parties to the controversy for two full days I regret to say that at the present time it is evident that further efforts at mediation will prove useless . The gap between the desires and demands of the parties has not been closed and I am , at least for the present , giving up my efforts . " Mr. Meyer , in response to questions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MEDIATORS FAIL // there would be any early effort to renew negotiations through him and added that he planned to return to Florida this morning . Asked whether spokesmen for the company had indicated whether they planned to resume bus operation with the aid of strikebreakers , he said nothing had been said to him on that subject . " What do you think the next step will be to settle this strike , " Mr. Meyer was asked . " The next step ? " he replied . " I can think of none that can be made at the present time . It looks as though the strike will continue until settled by power instead of by reason . " Mr. Meyer then outlined the final proposals made by both sides just before the effort to mediate the strike was abandoned . Spokesmen for the companies left Mr. Meyer 's office ? without commenting on the breakdown of the mediation effort , but later , from the company offices at 605 West 132d Street , Mr. Ritchie issued a statement renewing the arbitration offers made earlier in the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus operation in the near future with the aid of strike-breakers , saying that they would " cross that bridge when we get to it . " Mr. Ritchie 's statement follows : " The Fifth Avenue Coach Company and the New York City Omnibus Corporation renew their offer of arbitration on return of the men to work under their present contract . " We have been negotiating and mediating with the union for more than three weeks , but it has been impossible to arrive at an agreement . After negotiations failed , in response to a call from the Mayor we accepted and went into mediation under Mr. Arthur Meyer , chairman of the State Mediation Board and a patient , conscientious , able and experienced mediator . We regret that it was unavailing . " Mr. Meyer has tried to get the men back to work and the buses moving again , but the union has point-blank refused unless their demands be met in advance . The union will not permit the public to ride pending arbitration or other solution . " We are willing to submit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arbitrator , we in turn to have the same right . We consider this the American way , the fair way , the just way to adjust a controversy over wages when the collective bargaining principle is recognized and the closed shop is in effect . " The union 's belated offer to reduce its demands from more than $3,000,000 to $1,000,000 proves how fantastic were their original demends . Their modified demands are impossible and wholly beyond the financial means of the companies . " In order that our position may be clear we declare publicly that we recognize the Transport Workers Union as the bargaining agency of the employes of our two companies and we also publicly declare that we will continue in any new agreement a closed shop . ? We are confident that the proposition we make is fair . We hope our employes will accept this offer . " Speaking for the ? union delegation , Austin Hogan , president of the New York local , issued the following statement : " We have been in constant conference with the Mayor and Mr. Arthur S. Meyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last two days . " Notwithstanding the vicious propaganda directed against the demands which were originally presented by the Transport Workers Union of America to the New York City Omnibus Corporation and the Fifth Avenue Coach Company , we are persuaded that these demands constituted reasonable proposals as a basis for the negotiation of new contracts . " Mindful , however , of the transportation needs of the people of the City of New York and in deference to repeated requests by the Mayor and Mr. Meyer that we modify our demands so as to permit of a prompt settlement which would terminate the strike and restore bus service to the people of our city , the negotiating committee of the Transport Workers Union unanimously voted to revise the demands as follows : " The original demands made upon the New York City Omnibus Corporation , as estimated by the company itself , amounted to $2,000,000 . These demands were reduced to the sum of $750,000 . The net corporate income of the New York City Omnibus Corporation exceeds $2,000,000 a. year . The granting of a $750,000 increase will leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - 000 , which will still permit it to pay a 25 per cent dividend each year to its stockholders . " The original demands on the Fifth Avenue Coach Company , as estimated by the company itself , amounted to 411,248,000 . These demands were reduced to $250,000 . The net corporate income of the Fifth Avenue Coach Company , which exceeds $500,000 a year , will still permit It to pay out to its stockholders a liberal yearly dividend on their real investment . " The revised demands were presented by Mr. Meyer to John A. Ritchie , chairman of the board of both companies , and Mr. Ritchie not Only rejected them but adhered to his original stubborn refusal to make any improvement in our conditions . " Much as we regret the inconvenience to the people , the unyielding and unreasonable position of the companies compels us to continue the strike . " We wish to express our sincere appreciation of the efforts of Mr. Meyer to bring about a settlement . " As on Thursday , when Mr. Meyer and the Mayor began their efforts at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John E. McCarthy , president of both companies , and Boykin C. Wright , counsel . The union spokesmen , in addition to the negotiating committee of fourteen , included Mr. Hogan , Michael J.

Mr. Meyer began his final day of conference at 11 A. M. , talking first with both groups together and then with each separately . At 2 P. M. , in response to a telephoned request from Mayor La Guardia , he went to City Hall , accompanied by Mrs. Ethel S. Epstein , the Mayor 's labor secretary , to report . Both Mr. Meyer and the Mayor indicated , after their talk , their belief that no strike settlement was yet in sight . At 4 P.
