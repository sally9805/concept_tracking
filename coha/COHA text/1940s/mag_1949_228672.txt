In an 8-to-1 decision last year , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Champaign , Ill. school board had violated the Constitution when it permitted religious instruction during school hours and on school property ( TIME , March 22 , 1948 ) . Champaign thereupon closed down its formal religious program ; churchmen and educators waited to see how other communities would react . Last week , a survey by the National Education Association gave the first comprehensive check . <P> Replies from 2,639 public-school systems throughout the country showed that 1,931 ( 73.2% ) had no religious instruction program . Of these , a sixth had recently abandoned such programs . Commonest reason : last year 's Supreme Court decision . Nonetheless , more schools ( about 13% ) had religious education than in 1940.
