Purpose : a six-week coast-to-coast tour inspecting the progress of the monster British Commonwealth Air Training Plan . In the R.A.F. , the Duke holds the rank of Air Commodore on the staff of the Inspector General . <P> At the coronation of his father and mother in 1910 , seven-year-old Prince George was bored . Reaching over to tickle his solemn-faced sister Princess Mary , now the Princess Royal , he slipped off his seat and plopped to the floor . When Mary stooped over to pick him up , her coronet fell off . The Prince of Wales ( now Governor of the Bahamas ) unsnarled the confusion by fielding the coronet , restoring it to his sister 's head and threatening to punch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before World War II 's outbreak , the Duke of Kent was known in Britain as a driver of fast cars , an eager nightclub patron ( he plays quite good jazz piano ) , the husband of beauteous , peacock-proud Princess Marina of Greece .
