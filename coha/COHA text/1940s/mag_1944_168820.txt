Last month Manhattan 's tough , free-swinging Park Commissioner Robert Moses* took a swing at the professional city planners , and a battle royal was on . Round I was Commissioner Moses ' . In a New York Times article , " Mr. Moses Dissects the Long-Haired Planners , " he slashed at critics who claim that he is : <P> Just a politician who would like to control Manhattan 's city planning without understanding Manhattan 's basic needs . <P> A mere city patcher and prettifier whose chief interest is showy public works but not slum clearance . <P> A man who does not understand that the city of today must be torn down so that the city of tomorrow can be replanned and rebuilt from the ground up . <P> Last week advocates of city planning lashed back . The Times published their replies under the title , " In Defense of City Planners . " <P> The Beiunslcis . Mr. Moses had been wildly provocative . Most city planners , he snorted , are " subsidized lamas in their remote mountain temples . " Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a social revolution . Many of the planners are emigres who do not understand U.S. conditions , are much too eager to show Americans how to tear down their cities . Moses called these planners the Beiunskis because many of their suggestions begin with " Bei uns in our country we do things much better . " <P> Moses named names . Among them : <P> Eliel Saarinen , Finnish founder of the Cranbrook ( Mich . ) Academy of Art . His city planning , said Moses , leads " straight into communal land ownership . " <P> Walter Gropius , former guiding genius of Germany 's modernist Bauhaus ( liquidated by Hitler ) , now head of Harvard 's Architecture Department . Gropius " fundamentally offers nothing more novel than the lally column and the two-by-four timber . " He is " hurting our architecture by advocating a philosophy which does n't belong here . " <P> Frank Lloyd Wright , No. 1 U.S. modernist architect . Wright would " get further " if he " tried an experiment on a reasonable scale , frankly called it an experiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern of all future American living . " <P> Lewis Mumford , voluminous writer on architecture and city planning : " An outspoken revolutionary , often quoted with approval by conservatives who obviously have no notion of the implications of his philosophy . " <P> Puerto Rico 's Governor Rexford Guy Tugwell , once ( 1938 ) chairman of the New York City Planning Commission . Tugwell specializes in " the kind of watercolor planning which consists of splashing green paint at a map and labeling the resulting blobs as ' open areas , ' ' green belts , ' ' breathing spaces , ' etc. "
