Sitting behind a Connecticut lunch-wagon counter and listening to the world 's news , Stephen J. Supina decided that what the United Nations needed was a nudge . Supina , who had been a turret gunner in the war , did not write a letter to the papers . Last week he hired a tiny red and yellow Aeronca plane , drew a circle around Lake Success on his map , wrapped 150 feet of wire around his middle and took off . <P> As he approached the target he let down a powder charge on the wire , and touched it off with a spark from two flashlight batteries . The resulting bang was heard for half a mile around . U.N . was not visibly affected , except that a guard , who disliked loud noises , complained of a stomachache and was sent home . <P> Supina landed at La Guardia Field , stepped out and waited to be arrested . When nobody showed up to seize him , Supina was somewhat embarrassed because he had no bus fare . He borrowed some cash , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the press described as a " manhunt " went on . The next day he walked disgustedly into a newspaper office and gave himself up . <P> One policeman pronounced a diagnosis that told at least as much about the postwar world as it did about the turret gunner . " Supina , " said the cop , " is suffering from hallucinations of world peace . " <P> " Shoot to Sink . " No such hallucinations afflicted the principals in a near naval battle off Staten Island last week . The Russian ship Pobeda came into New York harbor with 37 employees for Russia 's U.N . delegation . A U.S. health service officer came aboard for routine rat inspection . The Pobeda 's captain took umbrage at what he considered an affront to national honor when the inspector claimed to have found evidence of rats . He refused to have his ship fumigated , insisting that his was a clean ship , with no rats . The health men showed him rat footprints on greasy ladders . No use . They showed him tail prints in the ventilators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , the health inspector yelled to a Coast Guard cutter : " Shoot to sink if she moves fore or aft . " <P> It took four Soviet officials , hastily summoned from Manhattan , to convince the captain that the health men meant no insult . Grudgingly he allowed the Pobeda to be fumigated . <P> In the same week Joseph Stance , health inspector of Glen Cove , L.I. , was sure that what he smelled was no hallucination . More like an overworked cesspool , thought Stanco . He followed his nose to the old Maxwell estate at Glen Cove , now leased as a weekend recreation spot for Russian U.N . staffers . Stanco said that he could see a pump working on the cesspool but he could not pursue his investigation further because the Russians would not let him inside the house . " You have your laws , " said a courteous comrade , " and we have ours . Your American laws do not concern us . We do not need you here . You look after your people and we will look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were " adequate . " <P> And how about fire hazards , wondered the frustrated inspector ? Did the Russians know that fire laws prohibited occupancy of a frame house by more than 15 people ? " Our people , " said the comrade , as faces peered from virtually every window of the huge , three-story mansion , " do not smoke in bed . We will have no fires . "
