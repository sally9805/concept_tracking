On Paris ' Orly Field one night last week Pilot Herbert Tansey got his takeoff signal from the control tower and headed T.W.A. 's big four-engine Constellation down the light-bordered runway . Airborne , he picked up the landing gear and set the Star of Cairo on her course northwest for Shannon , Eire , the first stop on the regular Paris-New York run . It was midnight . <P> Back in the cabin , pretty Hostess Vina K. Ferguson moved up &; down the aisle , settling the passengers for the night . She checked the seating list . The bald , bespectacled Frenchman nodding in his seat was Pierre N. Dreyfus , son of the late Captain Alfred Dreyfus whose false conviction for treason to France outraged the world 52 years ago . The older man was Herman Koegel , native of Rudnik , Poland . In New York his wife and daughter waited for their first reunion since the Gestapo snatched him from them and his small business in Kpenick , Germany , one night in 1938 . The pretty , young French girl holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to join her ex-G.I. husband , Charles E. Waterbury of Newark , NJ . <P> On the way , Tansey got the latest weather report . A ground mist was hanging over Rineanna Field at Shannon . It had all but " socked in " the airdrome ; the ceiling was at 500 feet , the minimum for night landings there .

Anyhow , there was plenty of time to decide . <P> When the Star of Cairo reached Rine anna at 2 a.m. , Tansey was told the ceiling had fallen a bit ; it was 400 feet , but there were signs that it would lift . <P> Perhaps if Pilot Tansey had pulled up to 1,000 or 1,500 feet , to circle and wait , the flight might have been routine to the end . But he was at 500 feet and there he started to circle . Through the scudding lower clouds he could catch occasional glimpses of the ground . " As he passed through one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the plane apparently lost altitude and Tansey said he was suddenly flying into the ground . " <P> Disaster struck in a finger snap . The sleek , shiny Constellation tumbled drunkenly across a swampy , weed-covered islet on an arm of the Fergus River not two miles from the airfield . The left wing struck first , then the nose , which broke off and threw the pilot and copilot clear . The rest of the plane hurtled on , scattering its guts , plowing a deep rut in the mushy land . Watchers on Rineanna heard a thunderous crash as the Star hit , saw the flare of the
