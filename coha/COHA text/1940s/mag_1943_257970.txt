War has interfered with the Nieman Fellowships , under which selected newsmen get a year at Harvard University , at full pay , to study anything they wish except journalism ( 66 have won Fellowships since they were inaugurated in 1938 ) . Of the past year 's 16 Fellows , seven had dropped out before the school year 's end - one was drafted , two joined OWI , four were recalled to their jobs because of manpower shortages . Last week , after pondering whether to suspend for the duration , Harvard decided : Nieman Fellowships will be maintained on a restricted basis . Only newspapermen who are 1 ) reasonably draft-proof and who 2 ) want to bone up on postwar problems ( economic , political and social ) will be considered . The school year this year will begin in November . Successful candidates will be announced in early fall .
