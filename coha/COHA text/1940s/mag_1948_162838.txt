The 10,000-ton Continental is an ancient tub that served in two world wars , changed hands and names five times . Last week , as she headed from Antwerp to New York , her latest owner had high hopes that she would lead the way to a bright new future . Hard-bitten Operator Arnold Bernstein had twice built up a thriving transatlantic shipping business , both times had been swept off the sea . <P> As a prewar German shipping tycoon , he had wedged his way into the Atlantic traffic with simple , serviceable ships , the lowest tourist rates of any line , and an inexpensive elevator system for carrying automobiles uncrated . A Jew , the Nazis jailed him and confiscated his ships . Released , he went to the U.S. , built up a new Bernstein line that ran from New York to Antwerp and the Dutch ports . His ships were sunk during the war . Now , at 58 , he is at it again . <P> With German ports not yet back to normal , Bernstein 's prewar route to Belgium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main arteries to Europe . Each week , four or five ships of half a dozen lines leave U.S. ports for Antwerp and Rotterdam . Some carry only a tenth of their cargo capacity , and many lose money on the run . But all the lines have the same idea : to entrench themselves for the day when the U.S.-Lowlands route may carry as much as 3,000,000 tons of freight a year between the U.S. and a restored Western Europe . <P> With just the Continental as a starter , Bernstein must get more bottoms if he is to hold his own . He is trying to buy two ships from the U.S. Maritime Commission . This week , in Washington , the Maritime Commission will hold hearings to see whether Bernstein should get federal subsidies to buy or build new ships . <P> The competition is tough . Black Diamond Steamship Corp. , a veteran on the Lowlands run , is also out for subsidies , and U.S. Lines and Waterman Steamship Corp . are opposing federal aid to their competitors . But Bernstein is in a fighting mood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business is a kind of war and you stand a fair chance of winning if you stick to your guns . "
