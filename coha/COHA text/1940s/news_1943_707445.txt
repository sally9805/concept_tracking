txt A capital outlay budget of $55 , - 568,188 for 1944 was unanimously approved yesterday by the Board of Estimate . The board increased by $5,561,705 the total of $50,006 , - 483 recommended by the City Planning Commission and moved to expedite completion of the huge new municipal airport in the Idlewild section of Queens by adding $12,654,000 to the allowance made for that project by the city 's official planning agency . The surprising increase in the allocation for the Idlewild project was offset in part by drastic cuts in land acquisition and planning costs for other projects , including new post-war hospitals and the reconstruction and alteration of old ones . Controller Joseph D. said , after the meeting , that these cuts would not impair the hospital improvement - nd expansion program because in all probability all the sites for the proposed new buildings could not be acquired in 1944 .

The city will not be committed to any expenditures under this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the course of 1944 . Mayor La Guardia , in an oral message sent to the board and delivered by Deputy Mayor Rufus E. , emphasized that when the time came to vote on such appropriations the conditions then existing must receive due weight . The new budget , as adopted , was the product of an executive meeting held last Monday . It revealed that the original estimated cost of about $10,000,000 for construction of the airport , exclusive of land acquisitions and the expense of providing hangars and other buildings , had since been raised to $60 , - 688,000 . The City Planning Commission recommended that $1,500,000 be spent in 1944 for land acquisition for the airport and $300,000 for planning and construction on it . The budget as adopted calls for $2,414,000 for land acquisition and $11,540,000 for planning and construction . Mayor La Guardia , it was disclosed , pressed for speed in completing the project so that the city might take its proper place , immediately after the war ends , as a commercial aviation center . The estimated cost of $60,688,000 covers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio installations and miscellaneous items , but excludes land acquisition and the cost of hangars and other buildings . Controller said he ' was in full accord with the Mayor 's program and that there was a strong probability that by midsummer or early fall paving would have progressed far enough to make some of the new airport 's huge runways available for plane traffic . Cuts in Hospital Items As adopted by the Board of Estimate , the new capital budget sliced $3,431,000 from the total recommended by the City Planning Commission for the Hospital Department . Most of this was shaved off by reducing estimates for cost of land acquisition during the year , on the theory that not all the land needed could be acquired in that period . Other reductions were made by revising downward the estimated total costs of some projects .

An item of $127,000 for chronic disease buildings at Bellevue Hospital and Welfare Island was cut to $35,000 . The board added to the budget of the City Planning Commission an item of $1,000,000 for acquisition of sites for " any of the following hospitals " ? listing those whose proposed allotments had been reduced by $500,000 each . The Board of Estimate also increased the recommendation of the City Planning Commission for $33,800 for extension of La Guardia Field and completion of pending improvements there to $450,000 . It eliminated , however , an item of $15,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $18 , - 000 the planning board 's recommendation for construction work and property acquisition at the seaplane base at that field .
