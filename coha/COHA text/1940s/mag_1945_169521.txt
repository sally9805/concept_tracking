When the munitions ship Mont Blanc exploded in the harbor of Halifax , N.S. on Dec. 6 , 1917 , the shock was felt more than 150 miles away . The explosion killed more than 1,100 , laid waste two square miles of the city . The Mont Blanc carried 3,000 tons of TNT . The single atomic bomb which fell on Hiroshima in Japan this week exploded with approximately seven times the force of that tremendous charge . <P> How the atomic explosive is made is one of the world 's most closely guarded secrets . But the fundamental principle behind it can be understood by any layman . <P> It was , as President Truman said , a " harnessing of the basic power of the universe . " That power is contained in the atom , the fundamental unit in nature . An infinitesimal universe in itself , the atom consists of a nucleus of protons and neutrons , around which electrons swing in widely spaced orbits , like planets around the sun . <P> If a drop of water were enlarged to the size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the size of an orange . Yet most of an atom is empty space through which the electrons whirl . The nucleus itself occupies only one million-billionth of the atom 's bulk . <P> The Target . The atom 's energy , " the basic power of the universe , " is contained in the nucleus . To release that energy , this unimaginably small object must be " split " or " smashed . " For would-be atom-smashers , the atomic nucleus thus became a target . The problem was to find a bullet small and tough enough to blast it , and a gun powerful and accurate enough to aim that bullet . <P> Such a " gun " was invented in 1932 by University of California 's brilliant young Ernest Orlando Lawrence . He called it a cyclotron . But the cyclotron failed to do more than chip off particles from the target nuclei , leaving the body of the nucleus intact , releasing comparatively little energy . <P> The Event . Sunday-supplement readers had long been warned that if ever an atom were split , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event occurred , only the scientific world quivered . <P> It happened in 1939 in the laboratory of a German scientist , Otto Hahn of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin . <P> He succeeded because he chose the right target , an atom of an extremely rare form of uranium ( U 235 ) , which he bombarded with a stream of neutrons . The explosion which occurred when the uranium atom finally split was , proportionately , the greatest man-made blast in history ; it released 200 million electron-volts . But because the source and volume were so small , the shock was not enough to knock a fly off the wall . As war overtook the world , the problem of releasing atomic energy in quantity , as for a bomb , still remained unsolved . <P> <P> The Real Race . For scientists and laymen alike , this week 's historic blast was the first indication of the progress made in the greatest and most-secret research race of the war . Except for a few breathless tales of mysterious walled laboratories and factories whose workers were interned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> A host of famed scientists , including such bigwigs as Niels Bohr , Lawrence , Arthur Holly Compton and James B.
