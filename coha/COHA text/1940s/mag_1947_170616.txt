A fortnight ago , sportsmen at South Carolina 's Branchdale Jockey Club revived the ancient sport of goose pulling ( TIME , March 10 ) . Last week they found that they had ruffled far more feathers than those on the neck of the goose . Indignant letters poured into the state 's newspapers . The S.P.C.A. asked that a warrant be drawn up , charging Edward O'Brien , president of the club , with cruelty to animals . O'Brien apologized : " We are as sorry as possible . . . . Nothing of this kind will ever happen again . "
