Benjamin J. Davis , New York 's Communist councilman who thinks Communism is a science ( TIME , Jan. 26 ) , uncovered another foul capitalist plot last week . This time , said he , it was " an attempt to intimidate the powerful Negro sentiment behind the presidential candidacy of Henry Wallace . " <P> What got Communist Davis ' dander up was the arrest in Harlem one night last week of Claudia Jones , 32 , nee Claudia Vera Cumberbatch , known also as Mrs. Scholnick ( for her ex-husband ) . Miss Jones , a Negro , is secretary of the National Women 's Commission of the Communist Party , a member of its national committee , long active in the late Young Communist League and a frequent contributor to the columns of the Daily Worker . <P> Like Alexander Bittelman , the Russian-born Communist intellectual picked up a fortnight ago in Miami , she is an alien . She came to the U.S. from Trinidad in 1924 , and the Department of Justice would like to send her back . She spent one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1,000 . Promptly the Communist apparatus of protest ( which involves meetings , indignant telegrams , denunciations ) meshed into gear . <P> It might be , however , that considerable time will elapse before Bittelman is deported to Russia or Claudia Jones to her native Trinidad . There will , of course , be the usual lengthy appeals to the courts . But even after they are exhausted , there is one other big hurdle in the way . Their native countries may simply refuse to take them back .
