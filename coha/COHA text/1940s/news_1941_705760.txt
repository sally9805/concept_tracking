But as soon as our bombs began to fall all the guns fired . It was no longer any use for them to pretend Berlin was not just below us .

The thirty-fourth Nazi fighter plane destroyed in the daylight air battles Thursday , when the Flying Fortresses and British-made bombers raided the French coast bases of Germany 's battleships , was credited by air officials yesterday to a Free Frenc:i pilot with the R.

After the Scharnhorst had slipped out of Brest last week and gone to La Pallice in an effort to escape the constant R. A. F. hammering , air officials said , the Nazis constructed a dummy " Scharnhorst " in the battleship 's former berth at Brest . British reconnaissance pilots discovered the dummy and recognized it as such because they were familiar with the real thing . At dusk Tuesday the Scharnhorst was in her usual berth at Brest . At dawn Wednesday there was every outward appearance that she was still there . The overhead camouflage netting with which the Germans had screened the battleship was in place and underneath it was what resembled the hulk of the war vessel . The R. A.

" The British said it was " a creditable piece of bluff . " The R. A. F. located the Scharnhorst at La Pallice , down the French coast near La Rochelle , and bombed her twice late Wednesday and again Thursday . The decoy tanker , as well as the Gneisenau , at Brest was hit in the attack there .
