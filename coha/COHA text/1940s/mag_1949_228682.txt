The lonesome whoo-whoo of a train whistle wailed through the rushing chug-a-chug of a locomotive . Then a cowboy guitar picked up the forlorn rhythm of " I 'm a-goin ' where the climate fits my clothes " to introduce the treacly resonance of a radio announcer . In the oak-paneled commons room of Chicago Theological Seminary last week , 39 Protestant ministers and religious workers listened intently to the transcribed radio show that followed , How Christmas Came to Maggie Martin . <P> It was , as one Episcopal minister said , " 15 minutes of unabashed tearjerking . " Maggie , the daughter of an itinerant beanpicker , was rescued from social ostracism by the beautiful Baptist mission worker , Miss Lacey , whose well-modulated voice converted Maggie from a self-pitying brat to a self-sacrificing angel . As the program ended , the listeners began hurling comment and criticism at the head of Chicago Theological Seminary 's Professor Ross Snyder , moderator of the session and co-chairman of Chicago 's Religious Radio Workshop . <P> New Techniques . This week , the Workshop wound up its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsidiary workshops held throughout the country , it is the answer of the Protestant Radio Commission to the problem of putting radio to work for religion . Through the workshops have gone the leaders of most U.S. denominational radio committees . <P> The results are already easy to detect even from the loudspeaker end . The old sing-preach-and-pray formula that made radio religion a drug on the market is giving way more &; more to the kind of religious programming that competes with secular shows : religious newscasts , interviews , round tables , special events and dramatic shows . <P> New Ideas . Co-chairman of the Workshop with Snyder , and a recognized leader in the field of religious radio , is energetic , balding Everett C. Parker , 36 . He was working for a radio station in Chicago when a Methodist minister asked him to help get a sponsor for a religious show . Parker became so interested in the field that he began experimenting with new program ideas , ended by getting 152 churches to cooperate in a regular broadcast . Parker quit his job to study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1943 , and began to devote his full time to the radio field . In 1944 , with Yale 's late James Rowland Angell , he set up the Joint Religious Radio Committee , mainly supported by the Congregational Church . Last year the J.R.R.C. became the Protestant Radio Commission , financed by contributions from 16 major denominations and eight leading interdenominational agencies .
