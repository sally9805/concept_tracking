Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers : for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness ? . . . Wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate , saith the Lord . . . <P> - II Corinthians 6 ; 14,17 <P> Seventh-Day Adventists take their separateness seriously . They do no " unnecessary " work on Saturdays ( their Sabbath ) and refuse to " strive " against their fellow men . During World War II the U.S. Army came to terms with them . Now U.S. labor is following suit . <P> Last week the Adventists announced at they had signed an agreement with the United Auto Workers ( CIO ) . Adventist auto workers agreed to contribute the monetary equivalent of union dues to a sick-benefit or some other workmen 's benevolent fund , and to refrain from backing either side in the event of a strike . In return , they will receive from the union a card exempting them from all dues , meetings and other union activities in any of the U.A.W. 's 900 locals . <P> The man responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carlyle B Haynes of Washington , B.C. , who has made similar bargains with twelve other international unions during the past two years . Says he : " We believe that we ought not to be tied up in any organization which by a majority vote can bind us to a course of action contrary to our religious convictions . " <P> So far , Haynes has suffered only one turndown-from the Plumbers &; Steam Fitters union , on the grounds that such exceptions would create an unfortunate precedent . " Your people do n't belong in these big industrial centers , " a union official told him . Haynes replied that his church is working on a back-to-the-country campaign . <P> " They do n't even belong here on earth , " said the union man . " Well , " said Haynes , we plan on moving to another world shortly , and while we remain in this one we want our liberties respected . "
