Ever since " he started it last summer , Ontario 's Premier George Drew had been whooping up his air immigration scheme . When the first goal of 7,000 British immigrants was reached last month , he announced that 8,000 more would be flown in by October . Last week he killed the project . His explanation : Trade and Commerce Minister C. D. Howe wanted to grab all Ontario 's immigration traffic for the government 's Trans-Canada Air Lines . <P> The two men had been feuding ever since Howe notified Drew last month that T.C.A. , previously too short of planes to do the job , now had enough equipment . As a result , said Howe , the arrangement with Transocean Air Lines , a U.S. firm which had brought over most of the immigrants under a T.C.A. subcontract , would end on April 15 . That , said Howe , would help Canada conserve U.S. dollars . Furthermore , Transocean was using " substandard " equipment . ( Transocean uses U.S.-made DC-4s ; Trans-Canada uses Canada-made North Stars , i.e. , modified DC-6s with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister with " outright dishonesty , " he roared that " not one cent " of Canadian money had been spent . As for Transocean , Howe was guilty of " shameless slander . " <P> Then it was Howe 's turn . British immigrants , he pointed out , paid their fares in sterling , which Canada 's government had to convert into dollars . Then came a haymaker . He produced two letters from Drew 's own officials questioning the safety of Transocean 's operation . <P> Drew 's answer was to throw the whole affair into Howe 's lap : the Dominion Government should " now inaugurate its own immigration program . " That put it squarely up to Ottawa . It also got Drew off the hook . Ontario 's labor shortage is easing up . Moreover , immigrants are squawking at the poor jobs offered and the appalling housing shortage there . Drew 's immigration program seemed headed for the scrap heap anyhow . Now he could blame it on Ottawa .               @ @ @ @ @ @
