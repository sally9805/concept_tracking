Some day it may be too late for the U.S. to get itself an international air policy . <P> A **29;2389;TOOLONG air conference was scheduled to take place in Washington in the third week of March . The third week came and went with no conference-but plenty of conjecture . <P> Ring around the Rosy . The scheduled meetings were supposed to be mere preliminaries leading up to a full-dress United Nations conference . But the preliminaries to the preliminaries turned out to be a caricature of the minuetlike delicacy with which diplomats approach foreign affairs . Stages in the ring-around-the-rosy : <P> Last October , Britain , with much fanfare , called an Empire conference to lay down postwar air policies . It flopped : the Dominions ( notably Canada ) had their own ideas about flying . <P> Then Britain , perhaps thinking to outflank her unruly daughters , asked the U.S. to confer separately with her . The U.S. regretted she was unable to lunch today-it being election year . <P> In February , the U.S. changed her mind , agreed to talk if Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . It was Britain 's turn to be horrified : how could she come to the party without all her Daughter Dominions ? <P> At this point both parties began adding names and everything came unstuck . By last week the guest list added up to 14*-and suppose all but one came- <P> This week both the U.S. and the British were ready to throw in the doilies and start all over again . But no one seemed to know how . One solution that might appeal to the State Department would be to run a whole series of bilateral talks-for one thing , that would take at least all this year . But whether Britain , long on plans but short on Dominion support , would buy that compromise-or the U.S. , long on plans and short on policy , suggest it-remained to be seen . <P> Two Plans and a Vacuum . Meanwhile , Britain and Canada already have firm air policies in print . Britain 's was brief , Canada 's detailed and carefully designed to distinguish Canada 's special interest from the Empire 's ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight International Air Transport Authority to license all world air routes and carriers and , as Britain put it , " eliminate uneconomic competition . " <P> All the U.S. had was a vacuum compounded of mistrust and indecision in the Senate , " studies " by the State Department 's studious Adolf Berle-and a man to head the U.S. delegation to the forthcoming conferences . The man : ex-U.S . Ambassador to Japan , Joseph Clark Grew , a good diplomat who nonetheless knew nothing about aviation , until he got his new assignment two weeks ago . The only other certainty was that no U.S. air " expert " liked Britain 's well-ordered I.A.T.A. All sides were quick to point out that Britain , as the No. 1 sea power , had never seen fit to call for such restrictions on the high seas . All asked why the world 's No. 1 air power , the U.S. , should call for such restrictions in the stratosphere.
