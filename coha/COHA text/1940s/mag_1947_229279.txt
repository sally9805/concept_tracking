For television , it was a historic week . At the opening of the 80th Congress , the House of Representatives was televised for the first time . During interminable roll calls , television 's great eye strayed about the House-catching children sitting still as Capitol mice on Representatives ' laps , investigating the planetary glow of congressional baldpates . <P> In this one memorable broadcast , television proved that its window on history was almost as clear as the newsreel 's , and far closer in time . Telecasters bragged that they would soon be opening their window on bigger &; better sights ; RCA President David Sarnoff announced that the 1948 presidential campaign would be televised . But unless television got a move on , few in the U.S. would see a political or any other kind of telecast by 1948 . <P> Though there are nine television stations operating on regular schedules ( in New York , Philadelphia , Washington , Schenectady , Chicago , Los Angeles ) , they broadcast , on an average , only 20 hours a week , and only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are only 12,000 sets in U.S. homes , 13,000 fewer than in Britain . And the road to full set production has been blocked first by material shortages and of late by " the color controversy . " <P> The gist of it : there are two systems of television-all electronic ( RCA ) , which has yet to go beyond black &; white , and will not have color before 1951 ; part-mechanical ( CBS ) , which has already developed color telecasting . The 12,000 U.S. sets today are black &; white electronic , and many experts contend that in the end some sort of electronic method will be universally adopted for colors . It is up to FCC to decide whether color shall be introduced now , with mechanical television , or whether it must wait on all electronic development . Until FCC makes up its mind , few want to buy a television set , quite apart from the cost-from $225 to $2,500 , plus a minimum $45 installation fee . <P> But the screen of television 's future is not wholly dark : 1 ) a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brighter than its predecessor , makes candlelight do the job of a battery of floodlights ; 2 ) construction of 44 new stations is expected to begin after FCC gives its ruling ; 3 ) the Radio Manufacturing Association says that the U.S. is ready to build from 330,000 to 360,000 television sets in 1947.
