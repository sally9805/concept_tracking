WITH concrete and asphalt , rock and steel , engineers are changing the map of central California . B , recharting two river systems in the mos complicated irrigation project of histor3 the U. S. Bureau of Reclamation plans t save a $2,000,000,000 agricultural empir from the ravages of drought . Water fror the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers wi. be diverted into artificial beds ; two grea dams will function nearly 500 miles apart and fertile land , stretching half the length of the state in the vast trough between the Sierras and the coastal mountains , will receive needed moisture . Paradoxes and superlatives characterize the gigantic project . Man-made rivers , for example , will flow over other rivers on bridges . Twenty miles from Fresno , Friant Dam , a 1,500,000-cubic-yard barrier of concrete , will cut off the waters of the San Joaquin River where it emerges from the  | Sierra Nevada Mountains and divert the flow in- I to a giant , concrete-lined gravity canal . For 160 miles , the torrent will rush southward before emptying into the dying Kern River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on concrete bridges three other rivers , the Tule , the Kaweah , and the Kings . A second canal will run northward from Friant Dam , crossing two stream beds to empty into the dry Chowchilla River , forty miles away . By keeping this stream flowing throughout the year , it will revive farm lands once famous for raisins , wine , and table grapes . A stream running uphill for more than 150 miles is another paradoxical feature of the plan . A cross channel will divert part of the Sacramento 's flow across sloughs into the mouth of the drained San Joaquin . Here , by means of pumping stations and collapsible dams , the water will be forced up empty river beds and through man-mad canals until it reaches a point sixtytwo feet above its starting point and more than 150 miles away . From here , the misplaced stream will slip twenty-three miles by gravity to rejoin the San Joaquin 's bed at Mendota . At the northern end of the Central Valley ,  | Shasta Dam , the highest concrete overflow dam in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the $170,000,000 project . Five hundred and sixty feet high , and 580 feet thick at the base , this immense barrier will measure just under three quarters of a mile along its crest . It will be higher than Grand Coulee Dam and will exceed Boulder Dam in mass . In preparation for pouring the billions of cubic yards of concrete which will go into this structure , contractors are now erecting the largest conveyor system ever built . Stretching across hills and valleys for nearly ten miles , crossing over the Sacramento River twice , passing over the main line of the Southern Pacific Railway , over U. S. Highway 99 , and over five county roads and four creeks , the moving belts will transport 10,000,000 tons of sand and gravel to the site of the dam . Twenty-six 200-horsepower electric motors , each operating one section of the conveyor belt , will keep a steady stream of sand and gravel moving at a speed of 550 feet a minute to deliver as  | much as 22,000 tons of material a day at the site of the dam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shasta Dam , when it is completed , will plunge downward three times as far as the waters of Niagara Falls . The great dam will back up the Sacramento , Pit , and McCloud rivers for a distance of thirtyfive miles . By regulating the flow of  | water , it will make the Sacramento navigable for 160 miles . Between the two dams , Shasta in the north and Friant to the south , 350 miles of canals , almost countless bridges , numerous aqueducts , tunnels , siphons , and pumping plants will play their part in the complicated operation of the great irrigation system . Two thirds of all the rainfall in California 's Central Valley descends on the northern end . As a result , more than 50,000 acres of the state 's best farm land has been abandoned in the past two decades after the wells went dry . By revamping the natural drainage system of the region , the present vast undertaking will reduce flood hazards in the north and bring water , the lifeblood of the valley , to the farm lands in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
