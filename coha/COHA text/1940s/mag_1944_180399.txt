Sirs : <P> I thank you so much for the space and attention TIME ( March 13 ) has given to my recent autobiography , You 're Only Human Once . . . . There are , however , several points I should like to make : <P> 1 ) The Pullman you spoke of me renting to go to Hollywood in 1931 was , in reality , a private car . . . and was rented and paid for by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios . <P> 2 ) Maurice Chevalier . . . was never my beau . He did fall in love most charmingly with several of my friends . I think I have been blessed with sufficient " true loves " without the addition of Chevalier , who must be having troubles of his own in France today . <P> 3 ) You also mentioned the fact that four of my main roles in opera-Mimi , Tosca , Manon and Louise-have certainly been sung better by other people . Do you mean Melba as Mimi , Muzio as Tosca , Sibyl Sanderson as Manon , and Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Metropolitan , but they did create the golden memories of the past . <P> Well , I am a part of the present day of trial and tribulation for the singing artist . I am happy to feel , however , that it is the public 's opinion that has sustained my career and kept me a star for 20 years . I thank you again most profoundly for your review and , as long as I can go on creating " dramatic excitement merely by walking onto the stage , " there will be reason for prolonging that inevitable day when the curtain must fall on my singing career . <P> New York City <P> GRACE MOORE <P> Orphaned Niece ? <P> Sirs : <P> In TIME ( Feb. 28 ) I find the following statement in connection with George Antheil , the composer : " During his expatriation , he concertized widely , married a niece of Austrian Playwright Arthur Schnitzler . " <P> Being the son of Arthur Schnitzler , I should like to ask you where you got this information ? As far as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ohio . . . . I remember very well Mr. Antheil 's stay in Vienna , where I had the opportunity of meeting him once or twice . However , I was rather surprised to learn from TIME that I should regard Mr. Antheil as a relative of mine . Of course , it might be possible that I do n't know my own family . At any rate , you will understand my curiosity and forgive my bothering you with this question . <P> May I use this occasion to say how very much I have enjoyed being a subscriber of TIME for the last two years , and to thank you for reliable information , frequently brilliant writing , and often superior analysis of world events ; in short , for all the features which distinguish your magazine from other and less gratifying manifestations of journalism . <P> HENRY SCHNITZLER <P> University of California Berkeley , Calif . <P> TIME , grateful for Reader Schnitzler 's praise , suggests that he get in touch with Composer Antheil , who swears they are indeed related. - ED . <P> Abortion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended sadly , in midair . After shocking its readers quite justifiably about the estimated 1,000,000 abortions in the U.S. each year , then pointing out that police raids are no more a cure than they were for bootlegging , TIME sighs and says that no one has yet figured out the answer to such questions .
