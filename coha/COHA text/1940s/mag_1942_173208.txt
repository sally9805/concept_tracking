Before taxes took all the new payrolls away , before rationing got too tough , the people had decided to enjoy themselves . Some men were troubled that the spirit of sacrifice was not abroad ( see box ) . But whether or not men took the war to heart in every town that had a wartime boom , men followed their instinct : eat . drink and make merry for tomorrow we fight . There every night is Saturday night and Saturday night is New Year 's Eve . For example : <P> Gambling Seattle . Staid Seattle , its population swollen from 368,000 to 508,000 by war workers , has had twice as many arrests for drunkenness in six months as it had all last year . The city has its first successful burlesque house in 20 years . Customers stand in line at restaurants and theaters , pack the out-of-town roadhouses , keep the 25 slot machines clicking . Fourth Avenue and Pike Street , the hub of downtown Seattle , is often jampacked nearly 24 hours a day . <P> On weekdays , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for pleasure : for weekend trips to Longacres racetrack ( twelve miles away ) , Mount Rainier National Park ( 100 miles ) , the British Columbia trout country ( 490 miles ) . Gambling is so heavy and widespread that violent protests recently came from a man who is no long-nosed reformer : young Pete Terzick , editor for the Lumber &; Sawmill Workers ' Union paper . <P> Champagne in Portland . Nearly 50,000 men now earn $45-$115 a week in the shipyards at Portland , Ore . Nearby taverns do land-office business cashing shipworkers ' checks on Thursday ( for a dime or 20 fee ) , then selling them beer and the privilege of playing pinball machines . The Idle Hour Billiard Parlor cashes so many checks that it has installed a bullet-proof booth , with armed guards standing by . <P> Portland 's big cut-rate grocer , Fred Meyer , took his stock of champagne down from the top shelf , sold more in midsummer than he ever had at New Year 's . At night the greyhound races are packed . At the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts as last year . <P> Solid Senders in Chicago . When traffic lights in Chicago 's Loop flash red Saturday night , cars often line up for a solid block . At the Sherman Hotel , customers stand eight deep at the long Celtic Bar ; downstairs in the Panther Room , where a normal New Year 's crowd is 1,100 , nearly 2,500 swing-loving youngsters cramp in to hear the solid-sending of Glenn Miller 's band . <P> The crowds spill over into North Clark Street 's honky-tonks . Sitting six to a table meant for two , they whistle at strip-teasers ; until the closing hour , downtown Chicago jumps . <P> No Cooks In New Orleans . Oldtimers say they have never seen New Orleans , always a merry town , play so hard . The beach resort at Lake Pontchartrain did more business before July 4 than it had done all last year . New Orleans matrons , hard put to find servants , laughed last week at the story of a housewife who went to the Negro slums to look for a cook . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they knew of one , was told : " No. ma'am ; we 're looking for one ourselves . "
