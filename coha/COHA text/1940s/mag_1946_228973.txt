The Senate chamber had been as peaceful as a henhouse at laying time . Hardly a head was turned as New Mexico 's harmless-looking Democratic Senator Dennis Chavez rose and said : " I move that the Senate proceed to consideration of S. 101 . " Too late , his startled colleagues realized that a fox had gotten loose in their midst-S. 101 was the Fair Employment Practice bill which Southern Senators mortally hate and fear . <P> Alabama 's Senator Lister Hill came out of his chair like a rooster flapping for the high roost , began squawking in protest . But Chavez had successfully brought off a slick parliamentary maneuver. * A vote was taken . The motion passed , 49 to 17 . The FEPC fight was out in the open . <P> Georgia 's ordinarily quiet Walter F. George stood , livid with rage , to cry : " If that is all that Harry Truman has to offer , God help the Democratic Party in 1946 and 1948 ! " Boiling at the idea of giving a Negro a white man 's wage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all other legislation for weeks-or months . <P> The delaying action began as soon as the Senate convened the next day . Louisiana 's paunchy John H. Overton announced that he had noted " a number of errors " in the Congressional Journal , asked that it be read aloud . As soon as the clerks began to drone he began to interrupt-commas and semicolons , he believed , had been improperly used . Genially , wordily , he then discussed old Southern religion and kindred matters . He was still at it when the Senate recessed for the week . <P> Meanwhile the big guns of the Southern delegation had been gathering material for the battle to come . Mississippi 's roundheaded Senator James Eastland swore darkly to talk " two years if necessary . " His fellow Mississippian , Theodore ( " The Man " ) Bilbo was less rash . He would speak twice- " for 30 days each time . " <P> * Senators of both parties had agreed not to introduce controversial legislation until Thursday , the day originally scheduled for the President 's State of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message , most Senators assumed that the agreement was still in force . Senator Chavez argued successfully that the truce had expired . Moreover , he brought up the FEPC bill during the " morning hour " when debate on motions is prohibited by Senate rules , thus forcing an immediate vote before Southern Senators could marshal enough members to defeat him .
