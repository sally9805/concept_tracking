In a voice that was no longer calm and steady the old man said : " My day 's work is done . " <P> After more than 21 years ( 7,829 days ) as Canada 's Prime Minister , 73-year-old William Lyon Mackenzie King was bowing out . At his final press conference last week he looked ill . His lined face had a sickly flush , and the thin lock of grey hair that slipped over his right temple made him seem older than his years . His hands trembled as he toyed with the black ribbon of his pince-nez . His voice was unusually low , and sometimes he seemed to be groping for the right word . <P> During King 's absence and illness in London ( TIME , Nov. 1 ) , Louis St. Laurent , the man he had picked to succeed him , had moved into the Prime Minister 's office in the East Block . But for the press conference , everything was back in the same order in which methodical Mackenzie King had kept it over the years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Laurent , " had been taken off the walnut , table-type desk and was half-hidden on a shelf . Mackenzie King sat again in his stuffed blue swivel chair and rested his feet on the worn , carpeted footstool inherited from his predecessor and friend , Sir Wilfrid Laurier . <P> The last press conference was like many that had gone before : there was little news . When the time came for questions and a newsman asked about his " golden moment " in Canadian public life , sober-sided Mackenzie King could not think of an answer . Said he : " I am proudest . . . of keeping this nation united . " On questions about the new cabinet and the next election , King was his artful self in saying nothing . " I have been advised to avoid controversial issues , " he said . <P> This week , the man who , in his years in the East Block , had made Canada a nation , was driven to Rideau Hall , residence of Governor-General Viscount Alexander of Tunis . There he handed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take his place . Then Mackenzie King rode home with his memories to the peace &; sepulchral quiet of cavernous Laurier House .
