To answer some of the questions subscribers are asking about how TIME gathers , verifies , organizes and writes its news <P> TIME 'S Wilmott Ragsdale was n't sure you could do a loop in an Army glider until he went up in one at the new glider school at Twentynine Palms , California - suddenly felt his safety belt tighten and saw the desert above him . <P> He was n't sure how you get down , either - until his pilot banked the wings almost vertical , fell off into swooping circles and came out at 90 m.p.h. , 400 feet above the ground . <P> Probably you did n't know any more about these things than he did-so I think you will be especially interested in TIME 'S story on Page 48-and in knowing a bit more about Ragsdale and his part in making the story so clear and real . <P> Ragsdale works out of TIME 'S Washington office , but because of his rough and tumble travel experiences he is apt to be ordered anywhere . Educated at the University of Washington and at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logger , an oil driller , an extra in the Ballet Russe , a stevedore in Alaska , a publicity man for a symphony orchestra - and he sailed in the fo'c'sle to South America , the Caribbean , Europe and the Orient . <P> He originally got into the news business to make enough money to marry a girl he met in Paris - worked for the Wall Street Journal before he came to TIME . <P> Right now Correspondent Ragsdale is making a swing through practically all the specialized training camps of the West . He spent three days at the glider Air Academy at Twentynine Palms - going up with the students , getting the dope on equipment , organization , training . He jolted around with the Army 's new tank destroyer corps at Camp Hood in Killeen , Texas , where they had to move a cemetery to get the site they wanted . In the California desert at Indio ( very hot in the shade and no shade ) he saw our new desert warfare battalions being whipped into shape , heard General Patton applying the lessons our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite picture ( and also some welcome cool weather ) high up among the snowy peaks near Fort Lewis in Washington , where the U.S. Army is training our mountain fighters . <P> His trip is right in the tradition of TIME 'S Army &; Navy department - whose editors are themselves no table-top generals . Even before Pearl Harbor one or another of the senior writers in this department had personally visited practically every important Army &; Navy post from Honolulu to Newfoundland and Trinidad , 75 posts in all , many of them more than once . <P> But this week the news held all but one of these editors at their desks - while TIME 'S correspondents doubled for them on the scene of action- - Ragsdale out in the Western training camps , John Durant up in Concord , Mass. , where teetotaler Yank Levy . Britain 's No. 2 mayhem expert , is teaching guerrilla warfare to the State Guard ( see p. 46 ) - and Sam Lyons down at Camp Lee , Va. , where the Army is training its quartermaster corps to fight as well as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> P.I .
