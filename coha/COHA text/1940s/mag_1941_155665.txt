A six-year-old mare named Royal Wally , a habitual also-ran , was entered in New Jersey 's Essex Fox Hounds race meet last week . The Race Committee expected Member C. Suydam Cutting 's weekend guests , the Duke &; Duchess of Windsor , to attend the races . So rather than scratch Royal Wally , Owner Thomas Tully changed her name to Glenside . Fulfilling expectations , she finished last , but , alas , her former namesake did n't come .
