During World War II , the U.S. rated its bases in Newfoundland as the strongest outpost in North America 's Atlantic defense . Nearly $400 million was pumped into Newfoundland during the war years to build air and naval installations on the rugged island . In peacetime an average of $30 million a year continued to flow from Washington to keep the bases in first-rate shape and , incidentally , provide Newfoundland with the equivalent of an important industry . <P> On the human side , the U.S. deal with Newfoundland looked every bit as sound . In 1940 President Roosevelt , announcing the 99-year lease of the bases from England , had called them " gifts , generously given and gratefully received . " Since then , both sides seemed to live up to the spirit of the exchange . Some 900 U.S. servicemen married Newfoundland girls . Yank troops visited Newfoundlanders ' homes ; islanders were invited to the Americans ' parties and theaters . To all appearances , the hospitable Newfies and the free-spending Yanks had worked out a near-perfect landlord &; tenant arrangement with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Order . This week , like a diligent lawyer checking up on the fine-print clauses , Maclean 's magazine stepped in to warn the landlord that the new tenant was not all he seemed to be . Maclean 's Ottawa editor , Blair Fraser , wrote an eyebrow-lifting article entitled " Where the Yanks Rule a Part of Canada . " He charged that U.S. legal privileges in Newfoundland were out of line , and that Newfoundlanders had no real protection of law against the U.S. forces . Fraser cited examples : <P> A customs inspector , searching for contraband U.S. goods near two U.S. bases , was threatened with arrest by a gun-toting U.S. captain . The Newfoundland supreme court awarded damages to the customs man , but nobody paid . <P> Newfoundlander involved in a minor traffic accident at a U.S. base was ordered by an MP to report to the gatehouse . When he refused , the MP fired two warning shots ; one ricocheted and hit the man in the leg . The Newfoundlander spent 23 days in the base hospital and was billed $49.50 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Two Newfoundland motorists whose cars had been hit by U.S. military vehicles sued in their own courts and won damages . They could not collect . <P> Fraser 's verdict : " These incidents are invasions of sovereignty at the most vital of all levels , the protection of the citizen by law . " <P> Truth &; Consequences . Fraser 's charge that Newfoundlanders ' legal rights end at the gates of the U.S. bases was perfectly true . That was the letter of the British U.S. agreement drawn up when the bases were leased . Since then Newfoundland has become part of Canada , and Canada is not willing to grant , in one of her provinces , concessions to the U.S. as liberal as those that Britain handed over when Newfoundland was a colony . The occasional snarl-up of Canadian and U.S. legal authority rubbed Canadian pride raw .
