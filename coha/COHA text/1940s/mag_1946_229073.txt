History moved tensely on the wings of two planes that passed last week in opposite directions over the wreckage of Europe . One , an Army transport , brought from Venezia Giulia the bodies of five U.S. flyers whose unarmed plane was shot down by Yugoslav fighters in America 's first major postwar crisis . The crisis had passed , but the international tensions of which it was a peak continued . The five bodies , all crises past , lay flag-draped in the chapel of a Roman airport . <P> The other plane suddenly whisked Minister Vyacheslav Molotov from Paris to Moscow . He had taken French leave of his fellow peacemakers . Diplomats speculated : Had Molotov finally walked out on the conference ? Would he come back ? Or did his flight portend a major review of Russian tactics in face of the new tough U.S. stand ? Whatever the reason , the conversations in the Kremlin must be among the most stimulating ( and possibly among the most decisive ) in history .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
