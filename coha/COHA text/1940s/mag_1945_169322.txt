Two weeks before Pearl Harbor , John L. Lewis ' United Mine Workers ended a six-day strike . Its aim : to extend the union shop to the captive mines owned by the big steel companies . But the dispute lingered on until John L. got a settlement to suit him . The date : Dec. 7 , 1941 . <P> This week , as the war in Europe ended , 72,000 of John Lewis ' United Mine Workers were on strike in the hard-coal fields . The Government had taken over the mines ; the flag fluttered over the mineheads of 363 anthracite companies while John Lewis and the operators haggled over a new contract .
