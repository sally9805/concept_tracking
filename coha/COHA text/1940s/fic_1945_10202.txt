He was still more by himself than with us , but he sat at ease among us , and we were at ease with him there . If we had bothered to define the change in him , which we did n't , of course , we 'd probably have said that he had more confidence in himself , or that he finally " knew what it was all about .

When critics speak , as they do far too often now , of a composer or painter or writer as ; seminal , they mean something which is part of being nuclear ,  |p201but  still is n't all . You and I have argued about Joyce a lot , for instance , and I 'll admit that he is probably the most seminal of modern writers . Innumerable imitators stem from him , and many who are n't imitators have gained impetus from him . Yet he is n't nuclear . In himself , he repels more than he attracts .

Hawthornewas often marvelously restrained , but he is not nuclear .

Manymen , who have truly been termed great , were not nuclear . Washington was great , but Lincoln was , and therefore is , nuclear . If greatness is the ability to make changes which will be remembered , to accumulate about oneself the power of numbersand by means of it extend fear , death , destruction and sycophancyover wide lands and down long years , then Caesar and Napoleon and Alexander were great , but they were direct antagonistsof the nuclear .

Buddha speaking gently under his tree , Jesus speaking on the Mount , and not speakingp202before Pilate , were nuclear , still are , if you can dig back to them , but after them came immense , long-enduring structures , and the magic was destroyed .

Old HousesTHERM was another change in Tim 's life which was probablydue , at ( east iii part , to the effects of the mile run . It was a long-lasting and possibly very important change , the end of which , if such things ever have an absolute end , can not be discerned . Its beginning , however , for Tim , at least , can be quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight in the evening , a few days before Christmas in his junior year . Tim was up in his room , slowly waking an arrangement for Rob Gleaman'sband . The music paper lay on a board on the bed , and he sat in front of it , testing what he wrote by picking it softly on the violin , which he imagined to have , at various times , the timbreof a trumpet , a sax and a clarinet , as well as its own . He still had to be careful in this way , because he had n't yet learned to P205imagine a whole score being played by the many instruments at once . Sooner or later he would always begin to follow some one of them . He was happy sitting there in his hermit cell , slowly doing what he liked best . Coming back to this room , and to writing music in it , was always a comfort to him , even when he had n't felt particularly in need of comforting . It was like havingtime to rediscover oneself after struggling for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of them strangers . He did n't even know that he 'd heard the telephone ring downstairs until Grace called up to him , " Tim , you 're wanted on the phone . " This was enough of an event to make him uneasy . He dislikedtalking on a phone anyway . He had often walked as much as two or three miles to see someone about a small matter rather than use the phone . When he did talk on the phone , he liked to be very brief and matter of fact , to say and hear only things which would leave no guessing to be done . " There 's a good show at the Wigwam . Want to go ?  --  All right . Meet you at the corner of Virginia and Second at a quarter to seven . " That was the only way to use a telephone without feeling that you had relinquished your soul to another 's use , the way Indians felt ; about telling their true names or having their pictures taken . In the downstairs hall , under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr. Hazard 's nine-point buck , he whispered to Grace , " Who is it ? " Grace smiled at him , but the imp of Willis was in her eyes . " I would n't know , " she said , loudly enough for the phone to hear . " But it 's a girl with a dangerous voice . Low down and on purpose . " But Grace never pressed an advantage , and besides , she had graduated and was already engaged to the man who was going to take her to California . She was n't one really to mock even a young brother 's mysteries . The phone was in the hall . She went hack into the living room and closed the door . " Hello , " Tim said into the telephone . " Hello . Is that you , Tim ? " He did n't know the voice . " Yes . It 's me. "  | " I 'll bet you do n't know who this is ? " " No , " Tim said , swallowing and shifting his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . They were all girls ' voices , he thought , and they were making a smothered giggling noise . So that was it . He had heard about the trick . The voice would make him guess and guess and guess , not even telling him if he was right , to find out what girls he hoped might call him up , and then he would begin to meet girls , and boys too ( because the pleasure which comes from such jokes is directly proportionateto the amount of publicity which can be given them ) , who would ask him how long this one had been his secret sorrowand how long that one had been his pash , but he would never find out whom he had really talked to . Even so , the validityof this kind of test was nearly proven in him . In spite of the fact that he was not at all sure of the voice , everything in him rushed up dizzily and hopefully and wanted to guess Rachel . He throttled the impulse . " I told you , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , please guess , Timmy , " the voice begged . 1 le heard the giggling again , and the voice said , away from the phone , " For heaven 's sake , hush up. , , " No , " " Tint said . " I do n't want to guess . " " Please . I just want to sec if you can guess . Do n't you know who I am ? " Tim could feel the mounting ridicule of the gigglers as if he stood there in visible awkwardness and confusion before them , and saw all their bright eves laughing too . " No , " he said . " I do n't know . What do you want ? " " Oh , now you 're angry , Timmy . " " No , I 'm not . " " Wait a sec , " the voice said . There was whispering . Then a different voice said , " Hello , Tim . Do you know who this is ? " He knew , all right . He could tell by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the weakness in his knees . You might wonder if it was the real thing when it was n't , but whenP207it was , you knew . Then he remembered that she had been among the gigglers . He remembered now that he had heard the little , quick laugh . " No , I do n't , " he lied . " It 's Rachel Wells , " she said . She was n't being part of the trick then , anyway . If she was n't part of the trick , the rest did n't matter . It was silly , but it did n't matter . " Oh , hello , Rachel . " Then there was nothing for him to say , so he just stood there holding the phone . Rachel did n't seem to know what to say either . There was a long silence . Somebody on the other end was whispering . " Hello , Tim , " Rachel said . " Hello . " " That was Marjory you were talking to , " Rachel said . " Marjory who ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her house . Just a minute . She wants to talk to you again . " " Hello , Tim , " Marjory 's voice said again . " Hello . " " I 'm giving a party Friday night . Can you come ? " The whispering and giggling became laughing out loud for a. moment . " Hush , " Marjory whispered to them , violently . " He 's mad now. , , She spoke into the phone again , " Can you come , Timmy ? " " What is this ? A joke ? " " No , really it is n't , Timmy . Only they 're all so silly about everything . You 'll come , wo n't you ? " " I guess so . " " Well , you do n't have to if you do n't want to . " " You mean you 're really going to have a party ? " " Yes , really I am . You see , " she said away from the phone , but loud enough so he would be sure to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Sure . I 'd like to come , Marjory , " he said . " Well , " she said , " that 's better . About eight o'clock . "   " Who am I s'posed to bring ? " he asked . He asked in a spirit of resignation . He was used to being asked to bring one of the left-overs , after all the mutually desirous couples and the girls with secret sorrows had been taken care of . " Nobody , " Marjory said . " You 're my partner . " This was so surprising that he did n't reply . It was n't only that Marjory was giving the party , and so would have first choice , except for steadies . Marjory was a girl who was never left over . He had often wondered what she was really like insidethat thin , slowly flowing body and behind that clear stare . He believed that she must possess some dangerous and intriguingquality . Many other boys felt that way too . Marjory had dates for everything that went on . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . Gosh , no . That 's swell . " " Anybody might think it seemed pretty terrible to you , from the way you sounded . " " No , " he said , with a rush of honesty because her feelings were hurt . " Gee , no , Marjory , that was n't it . I just thought you were making fun of inc . All that guessing business , and everything . " " Oh , no , " Timmy , really I was n't . It was just a silly idea some of the girls had . I did n't even want to do it . I 'm sorry . " She was having a rush of honesty too . So the ordeal by phone ended in a small , warm triumph of amity , akin to the conclusions of some of his dream stories . He and Marjory between them had established something in spite of the others . Marjory 's house was in the corner of the south-side quarter where the court-house influence dominated , and the valley and the mountains were without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mansions , with jig-saw rails and eaves , which were commonin that quarter , and its once white paint had a smoky look , also common there . Inside it had high ceilings , tall , narrow windows , and tiny fireplaces with huge mantels , suggesting a familywhich had been successful about the time of the Comstock  |p209Boom  . The living room was all Tim knew of the house so far , and there even the ornaments and most of the furniture seemed to have lingered from the beginning . There was an ormolu clock under a glass bell on the mantel , and behind it a mirror in a heavy , gilt frame . There was a beaded portiere closing off the second living room , and a gilt chandelier with crystal pendantshanging down from a plaster garland in the center of the ceiling . The fireplace was faced with marble . The phonograph in one corner was modern , and the couch was wide and low and covered with flowered cloth , but one of the tables looked as if the marble slab had just been slipped off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight chairs were upholsteredwith horsehair or a striped satin , stained with use . The drapes were n't very old either , but they were maroon , to match the all-over carpet , which had once been much darker , and behind them were white lace curtains which completely covered the windows . Even on the brightest days , only a faint , diffused light got in and made wintry glints on the woodwork , the deep , gilt frames of the old portraits , and all the small objects which stood about on the tables , the mantel and the glassed-in bookcase , and the gloom absorbed these little highlights . There was always a musty smell in the room too , as if it were no more open to air than it was to light . Tim had felt , during his fewisits , that some very old person , almost too frail to speak , was sitting unnoticed in one of the shadows , and querulously resentinghis intrusion upon remembered dignity . It made him feel queer to be in Marjory 's living room in the afternoon after school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him that Marjory was resisting the house that way , and by prowling .1 ' a ) ut the room in time to the jazz and smoking a cigarette , and looking at everybody with that sinuous , adult gaze out of her pale-blue eyes . Yet sometimes , while she prowled , she would caress one or another of the litter of objects , and then it would seem that she was silently rejecting the visitors rat her than the room . Anyhow , whichever way her affection tended , that dissonanceremained her essential quality , the knowing eyes in the mild and girlish face , the ambling , liquid movements of her P210body , which yet seemed to be restraining gestures of impatience and discontent . Perhaps the house had nothing to do with it , though . Marjorydid n't really belong to the house . Her mother had come to Reno three years before , to get a divorce , and had stayed . She did n't own the house ; she rented it , and she had left it just as it was , bringing in very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a kind of sharp delight , that they might move into another house soon , or even that they might leave Reno soon . She did n't seem to care where they went . It was n't that she wanted to be in any particular place , but just that she did n't want to be where she was . Tim had never before been to the house in the evening . It was better in the evening . In the narrow hall there was only one small light on the ceiling in a red globe . In the living room the lights were brighter , the hardwood floor , bared for dancing , shone , and the innumerable highlights had color and warmth . All of this only pushed the shadows back a little and made them deeper , but this night gloom seemed less false and more mysterious , as if it might have arisen from greater tragedy than that of stuffy and isolated decay . The house now brooded not upon its slighted pride , but upon a dangerous and mischievous history , which filled it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloom herself at all . She had on a stiff , rustling , pale-blue evening gown , with gleaming folds , and there was a silver star in her hair and her mouth was painted very red . When she met Tim at the door , she seemed full of repressed excitement . She took his hand and squeezed it and then held it while she peered over his shoulder into the street , where snow lay under the arc light . " Oh , it 's lovely and cold and quiet out , is n't it ? Come on , " she said , almost gaily , and drew him farther in , and closed the door . He was n't wearing either hat or coat , and she did n't let go of his hand , but led him into the living room . It embarrassed him to be led in by the hand , yet there was a possessiveness about it which stirred him . Three other couples were already there . Mary was there with P211a boy called Coppy , and Rachel was there with Harvey Bradher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to school , and had an effusive but really friendly way of talking too much , and played classical music on the piano with a good hand but with too much foot and always with a tendency to go faster and faster , no matter what he was playing . He was extremely courteous , in an almost codified manner , and lie always brought his partner flowers . The other boy was Sheik , and he had brought Fay Bailey , a short , beautifully rounded little girl , who seemed much softer than she was and weightless , because her skin and her thick , resilient hair were so white that they gave the indefiniteimpression of something floating in air , of a misty and lighted cloud . Fay was an albino . Her face was lovely when you looked at it , but it dissolved from the memory . Something about her was secretive or aerial , because the same thing happened to your whole impression of her , not only of her body , but of her nature . You perceived her only by glimpses , even when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each enchantingglimpse would be enough to make you remember her forever , and then you looked away , and your image and your conception of her dissolved at once , and the next glimpse was a new discovery . She was very shy , but also very friendly when you spoke to her , lighting up quickly and softly . You imagined quick , furtive , gentle feelings darting about in her all the time . Nothing about her could ever be at rest . No matter how oftenyou had seen her , Fay still did n't seem real . Yet she was . She H was training to be a ballet dancer , and worked at it for hours every day . She was really hard , supple and strong . Other couples arrived every few minutes . Each time the doorbell rang , Marjory would take Tim by the hand and lead him out with her to meet the guests . Harvey was tending the phonograph and maintaining asteady line of chatter because everybody else was stiff and quiet . I le would n't let Rachel get far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an air of treasuring her , bending to lout his ear close to her mouth when she spoke , holding her arm when they were n't dancing , stopping his chatter sometimes to  |p212s|peak  very privately to her . Tim could n't help looking at them often . Sometimes , when he thought Rachel was looking at Mini , he wished Marjory would stop towing him around that way . Sheik made one attempt to liven up the party by going int i the Charleston , but it did n't feel right in that room , and the others only watched , and Fay deserted him , pretending she had to tell Mary something important . Then Mrs. Hale appeared in the doorway to the hall . She was thin and wide shouldered , like Marjory , but taller , and dark . When you saw the two of them at the same time you realized that Marjory 's way of eying the world was only a frail imitation of her mother 's . Mrs. Hale stood there in her black evening gown and wrap , drawing on her long black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they all felt very young and ridiculous . When she looked at Tim , he felt that his ankles and wrists stuck out of his suit , and that he had better not try to get his big feet past each other without some thought . Once Marjory had said , " Mother does n't give a damn what I do as long as I keep out of her way , " and Tim had thought she was only boasting . Now he wondered if she had n't been telling a bitter secret . " Good evening , " Mrs. Hale said to them all . " Marjory , " she commanded gently . Marjory went across to her , and they talked privately , and yet , somehow , as if there were no one else there . The others pretended to go on about what they were doing , but Tim had to stand there waiting . The outside door opened , without the bell ringing . A tall man , with a white silk scarf and a black overcoat with velvet lapels , appeared in the hall and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head and smiled at him too , and gave him her hand in a long , straight-armed gesture , and then went on talking to Marjory for a moment , letting the man hold her hand . Marjorynodded . " Good night , everyone . Have a good time , " Mrs. Hale said clearly.  |p213Everyone  in the living room mumbled , " Good night , Mrs. I tale , " and , " Thank you ; we will . " Then the man in the evening coat opened the door , and for a moment they heard Mrs. H ale 's high heels tapping down the steps , and then the door was closed again . Harvey had n't put a record on all the time Mrs. Hale was there . After a minute they heard the car moving away from the curb . It changed gears very softly and evenly out in the cold , muffled quiet , and then they could hear nothing at all . After that the music worked better , and everybody talked more easily and laughed back and forth while they were dancing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the evening . They were dancing together . Her body was very strong and solid in his arm , so that he could n't get over feeling astonished by her , but it was also light . Dancing with her was so much like dancing with nothing that at first he was worried about having control . Then he discovered that no matter what he was going to do , she always knew about it , and that it was only her perfectly timed acquiescence that made it seem he was n't guiding her . After that he felt free , and tried many steps and dips and turns he would n't have tried with most girls . He did n't know her very well , and she was so shy that they could n't talk easily , but he became quite happy and confident , just dancing with her . It was when they danced into the shadow of the doorway to he second living room that Tim was swiftly surprised . Fay stopped dancing and put her hand on the back of his head and drew him down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not being kissed that was the only surprise . The kiss itself was even more surprising . He kept expecting everything about Fay to be cool , airy and unreal , but the kiss was very warm and firm . He just stood there looking at her and holding her hand that he had held while they danced . The others were all laughing . When Tim did n't do anything , Sheik called , " I Icy , Fay , try me . " Fay looked up at Tim , and flushed , and laughed a little and pointed up . " Mistletoe , " she explained.  |p214Tim  looked up and saw the mistletoe hanging from the rod on which the beaded portieres had been pushed back . For a moment he felt cheated , as if an act of enchantment , promising a veiled but lovely future , had hardened into a parlor trick with cards or coins or a glass of water . He looked at Fay again . Fay tried to laugh , and struggled to pull her hand away from him , saying breathlessly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So he caught hold of her with the other hand too , and kissed her quickly , also on the cheek . Fay felt better at once , and they began to dance again . Later , when others were doing it too , he danced her back under the mistletoe and kissed her on the mouth . A great deal of new , quicker laughter and joking began . There were simulated Pan and Dryad chases . Girls pretended to resist being danced under the mistletoe , and sometimes would even struggle when they were there , after which they would be very strongly kissed . The shadows were completely transformed into desirable places , although nobody used them yet . The dancing was no longer awkward and formal . The excitement of the delectable game overcame all the shy or resistant personalfeelings . Rachel was kissed often tinder the mistletoe , but after the first time this did n't bother Tim . He laughed with all the others when Rachel struggled , and Rachel herself was really laughing , and giving up very nicely each time , when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He stole her from Harvey for a dance , and had his mind all made up to kiss her , so that he was trembling violently . Ile wanted to kiss her , very much , but then he could n't make himself do it . When he was dancing with her it stopped being a game . He was scared and bewildered , and began to dance stiffly . Then Rachel began to dance stiffly also , and was n't laughing any more , although she had laughed and twinkled at him at first , all ready to be kissed if he could keep it a game . I lc tried to joke with her , but they were all bad jokes , and after they had danced around the room three or four times , she did n't even try to answer him . They were two strangers or two people who do n't like each other very well . All the others were still dancing and chasing and laughing , but itp215seemed to Tim that the party had become silent and terrible . He yearned for Rachel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody else in the room mattered any more than if they had not been there , and yet he was afraid even to close his hand over Rachel 's while they danced . When the record ended he said , like a mannerly fool , and with the fierce look on his face , " Thank you very much , Rachel , " so she just said , " Thank you , " too , and turned away , hunting for somebody with whom she could feel free . Even so the party had worked up its own magic . He danced under the mistletoe with several other girls . I lc danced under it once with Mary , and they were both laughing , and Mary did n't even try to tease , but put her face up , and they were both surprised because it was a real kiss between their mouths . For a moment that stopped the game too . Tim felt a quick catch of affection for Mary , and he saw her eyes all at once serious , looking up at him , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But then she twisted her head away , and laughed , and cried , " No fair , Tim . That 's too much , " and they began to dance again . A long past of dreams poured through Tim . He was like an old man with memories , but much stronger and in more of a hurry . The memories made his emotions remember too , with little , painful , blissful tugs . It was like being in love with Mary again , and yet not quite able to bring the love up to the present . Certainly in the heart of Mary were furled the sunsets from over the mountains at Pyramid , the golden vistas into forevermore , which had also the sadness of nevermore . He rememberedriding home beside Mary in the back sea . of the old ledge , one stormy afternoon when the gray hills were lilac the hills in which Beowulf , Hazard version , battled the dragon and then sat dying proudly . Fine snow swept in separate sallies out of the air , which was cold and full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hid the tops of the hills , but far to the north , in one valley they crossed , slanting beams of white sunlight cut the storm and glorified chosen shoulders and breasts of the easternrange . They had seen that together , and manykindredwon/ders , and to such intangible splendors the spirit rose freely . All other creation was insignificant , the mind was freed of doubts and debts , and only that inexpressible ecstasy of light had place . Those who truly share such experiences are bound to one anothermore certainly than the disciples of one prophet . Even this conversion , however , passed back into the game , and Tim only remembered gladly that he had really kissed Mary , and that she had liked it . Later he really kissed some of the other girls , too . These kisses did n't make him glad in the same way , but they were exciting . Some time before midnight , everybody ate cake and ice cream . Then Tim carried in the big punch bowl , and when he had put it on the table in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was afraid it was Harvey , but he was n't sure , turned off all the lights but the one by the phonograph , and turned that one into the corner . Everybody became quieter . Couples formed more definitely , and sat in the shadows and talked in low voices , and gradually sat closer . 1 larvey took to playing only blues and waltzes on the phonograph , and the couples who danced moved very slowly , and had far-off , dreamy expressions . There was a great , palpitant , expectant softness in the room , and a feeling of loneliness which was already comforted by being there . It was then that ' find danced under the mistletoe with Marjory . They were dancing almost imperceptibly in the middle of the room , and she began to press him gently toward the doorway where the mistletoe was hanging . Tim knew this was going to be still different fn nn any of the other kisses . Marjory was dancingvery close to him , and her head was buried in his shoulder . It was almost dark under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the check , but she put her arm around his neck and drew her face closely across his until their mouths were together . Quickly , but with a little sigh , she let her mouth slide off the other side , but she still clung to him , and she whispered , " Timmy , there 's too much light here . " She pretended to keep on dancing , but it was n't just dancing , and it drew them behind the beaded portieres into the real darkness of the second living room . Then Marjory stopped even pretending to dance . Shep217had both arms around him , and she was making love to him with her thin , violent body as well as with her mouth . She strove against him to make him kiss her harder . They kissed many times , and only stopped when somebody in the front room made a joke loudly enough so that many laughed . Tim stiffened , and Marjory gradually let go of him . The joke was n't about them , though . Nobody had noticed them dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the kitchen with her to pour more punch . When he had put the punch bowl down beside the sink , he had to look at her , and she was staring at him . He felt , uneasily , that he was losing to her a power of independencethat he wanted to keep . He thought unsteadily of Rachel , and of the columns of cold sunlight he had remembered after kissing Mary . The thought of the sunlight made him remember a distant pass , with a sunset sky behind it , toward which he had once yearned from a valley way to the east of it , and then that was how he suddenly felt about Rachel , when he remembered that she was really still here , Rachel herself , just one room away . He was excited , wondering what was going to happenwith Marjory , and in a way he was fascinated , but he was n't happy . " Do n't you like me , Tim ? " Marjory whispered . " Sure I do , " he whispered . " Tim , please , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if expecting him to come to her , 1 ut he did n't move , and she drew herself back and stared at him again . He was reminded of Gladys looking at Beefy Woods in the eighth-grade room at the Orvis Ring . It was n't really the same , though . Dull , helpless , dirty Gladys was n't at all the same as Marjory , who looked very new and sharp . There was just something the same , maybe Gladys ' expression and the way he felt now . Marjory backed slowly to the wall where the light switch was , and leaned against it . She let her head fall hack , as if it were too heavy for her neck , and her eyes were half closed . She whispered his name . He went across to her . They werep218close to each other and looking at each other . " Please turn out the light , " Marjory whispered , and made a great sigh , and then a little moan , and reached her hand for him . His hand was shakingfoolishly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold of it , and the light went out with a click which sounded very loud . Marjory did n't move in the darkness until Tim began to draw her away from the wall . Then she came to him suddenly and as if there were no bones in her , and struggled against him , and kept acting as if her mouth had lost his , and needed badly to find it again . Between kisses , drooping against him , she would whisper . " Timmy , oh , Timmy , " she would whisper . " I love you , Timmy ; really , I do ; really . " She would end her whisperingalmost in his ear , and then let her face slide back against his , hunting for his mouth again . He began to want her mouth all the time , and to try to keep her from taking it away . Each time she whispered about loving him , he would try only to bring her face back where he could kiss her again , and stop the whispering . He could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ought to say it . Ile could n't just stand there holding her and kissing her and hearing her whisper such things and say nothing . She was wrestling him for those words most of all , and he knew it , hut- still he could n't say them . They stood there in the dark in the kitchen , engaged in this bewildering battle for a long time , until somebody in the front room yelled for more punch . It was nearly two o'clock when the party finally broke up . Marjory made him stand with her while she said good night to the others . They stood close together in the hall , and she held his hand against her all the time while she was saying , " Good night . I 'm so glad . I 'm so glad you did . Good night , Dan . See you tomorrow , Pauline . Good night , Fay , honey . " Where she held his hand , he could feel her hard thigh under the stiff , whistlingcloth of her skirt . She even pressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much attention to most of the good nights . 1 lc felt foolish , standing there as if it were his party which had just ended in his house , and he looked away from most of thede- parting guests quickly , and only said good night when they saidp219good night to him personally . But he could n't help watching Rachel leave , once she was n't standing right in front of him . There was a bulb on outside , over the steps , and Rachel , with her fur collar up beside her face , descended step by step in the light , dallying on each step , and then waited on the packed snow on the sidewalk , while 1 larvey completed his elaborate and whimsical thank-you . Even when she felt it most , Rachel could n't take long about thank-you . She looked back up once , and the light showed her face clearly , so that Tim 's breath nearly stopped , but most of the time she stood with her back turned , looking into the darkness under the trees toward VirginiaStreet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marjory began the kissing again , right there in the hall , against the door itself , in the dim , red light from the one globe . She was even fiercer and hungrier than she had been in the kitchen . She seemed to be trying to make him hurt her against the ridges of the great panels of the door . He kept thinking about Rachel 's face looking up , with the light on it , and the fur collar against it , and the snow out there . Suddenly Marjory slapped his face , though not hard , just playfully , and pushed him away . " Timmy , you 're a regular wooden Indian , " she said . " Go home . I 'm sleepy . " Once more she seemed very experienced , detached and malicious . She did n't sound angry . She sounded amused and a little bored . But the next evening , after supper , she called him up again . CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE : More About Marjory , Who Did n't Know What She Wanted , But Wanted It TerriblyTIM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly and by a roundabout way . After a few weeks they were one of the couples everybody knew was going steady . None ofp220the other boys asked Marjory for dates any more , and if there was a party to which couples were asked , it was just taken for granted that Marjory would come with Tim . He could n't un derstand how it had happened . She excited him by her despe fate way of making love with her mouth and her body , but when he was n't with her , he did n't know how he felt about her . Beingallied to her was like moving in a fog where something vas always hitting you unexpectedly , and you could never sec what it was that hit you . They came home one night from a dance he had taken her to instead of playing for it . There was only one light on in the living room , and Mrs. Hale was n't home . Tim had played with the band two nights that week already , and had been out anothernight for a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until three o'clock . He was very tired , in a nervous , unsleepy way that made everything singularly clear and important , but also unreal , almost allegorical . What he really wanted to do was sit still and try to make his mind stay with one thought longer , but Marjory was restless . She took off her coat , threw it over a chair , lit a cigarette and began to prowl . She usually acted this way when they had been out in a crowd , and she always ended by making violent love with him , unless she had one of her unfathomable grudges . Then she would make love to the house instead , touching things , caressing them , and looking at him with those old eyes , as if she knew things about him that made her want to laugh ironically . Tonight she was n't making love to the house , but she was different . She did n't put on any records ; she prowled in silence . She did n't look at Tim , and sometimes she tossed her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighed several times , loudly and briefly , as if she were nervous . At first Tint thought she was putting on an act , though he could n't think why . Then he decided she was really botheredabout something . He watched her for a little while , and then his mind stopped paving attention to her , and he only vaguely heard the soft sounds she was making , her pacing and pausing on the rug and the rustle of her gown . He was rememberingsomething they had seen on the way home . He hadn'tp221paid much attention to it at the time , not more than enough to make him grin a little , but now his mind had taken hold of it and was trying to make something important of it , something with a frightening meaning . He could n't quite get hold of the meaning though . He kept watching the scene go on again in his mind , and the meaning was always out there on the edge , where he could n't quite reach it . There were five people in evening clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sidewalk by the court-house lawn . I'hey were n't really old people , but they were n't young either . I ' our of them were a little drunk , happily drunk , or at least very noisy and gay about nothing for people of that age . They were watching a third man , in a tux and an overcoat , perform on the low fence of iron pipe along the edge of the lawn . They called advice to him , and clapped and cheered when he saved himself , and laughed like everything when he could n't . The third woman , probably the performer 's wife , was standing by herself and weeping silently , as if her heart would break , and every once in a while , when the performer failed , saying through her blubbering , but not as if she expected him to hear , " Please , Joey , come on now , please . " In spite of most of his audience , the performer did n't seem to o think he was doing anything funny . He was trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence was n't much more than : I foot high , but he was working with a serious , determined expression , and when he slipped or began to teeter , he struggled desperately , waving his arms and weaving , and looked really frightened . His mouth came open in a gasp , and his eyes stared . He appeared to believe he was hundreds of feet in the air , maybe walking the cable on a high bridge , and that if he fell off he would be killed . When he actually fell off , which he always did , he closed his eyes to hide what was going to kill him , so that sometimes he staggered about foolishly , and sometimes he sprawled on the lawn or the sidewalk , or sat down hard . Each tints he sprawled or sat down , he squeezed his eyes even tighter closed for a moment , and then opened them slowly and stared around in great surprise because he was still there . Each timep222he slipped off , the four laughed suddenly , and each time he sprawled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , they laughed much harder . Then he would start to get up again , and the weeping woman would plead , " Joey , darling , come on now , please . " The man who was walking the high cable , however , had a purpose or an ambition , or had made a vow or a bet . When he was back on his feet , he looked at his audience as if they were strangers whose continued presence he could n't understand . Then he brushed himself off , leaning over very carefully , and went back to the end of the pipe and began again . Tim still had n't found the meaning of this scene , when Marjorymade up her mind about whatever was bothering her . She moved more swiftly across to an end table , and stubbed her half-smoked cigarette out in a brass bowl , and came over in front of Tim and said , " Timmy , honey , play me something on the piano . " Tim did n't like to play this piano , which was an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jangled , but Marjory had made up her mind , and went into the second living room , where the piano was , and turned on the light over the music , and waited for him . He went in and sat down on the wobbly stool , and , after a moment to decide , began to play a blues with a very narrow range , stepping up the tempo from the start . Some of the weaknesses of the piano were disguised when you played it loud and fast . But Marjory said , " No , no , please , Timmy , not that stuff . Play me something nice . " He stopped playing , and asked , " What ? " " I do n't care , " she said , " but something nice , something sad and nice . Chopin or Debussy or one of them . " Her words sounded careless , but the way she said them was n't careless . She sounded as if it mattered a great deal to her that he should n't play barrel-house now . ' the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice and sad to come out of the old piano , began to take on an elusive , allegorical importance like that behind the man trying to walk the fence . He knew what it would sound like , but he started to play the Moonlight Sonata . He wouldp223play it slowly , but very softly , and try to slur over the worst keys . Marjory stopped him again . " That sounds terrible , " she said . " The piano , I mean . Let 's have a drink , Timmy , a real drink . " Beer was the only thing Tim had ever had to drink , more than to pretend , when he was with the band , and a bottle was passed around . But this was n't beer ; it was Bourbon . It said so on the bottle . Marjory moved restlessly about in the kitchen , prowling even while she mixed the drinks . Then they took the drinks back into the front room , and Marjory turned off all the other lights as she went , so there was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . She kicked off her shoes , and curled her legs under her on the couch , and Tim sat down beside her , and they drank slowly and talked . Then all of a sudden Marjory seemed to make up her mind about somethingagain , and finished her drink quickly , and said , " I want another . This was what I wanted , all right . Bottoms up , Timmy , and I 'll make us another . " So he finished his drink in two or three gulps , although he did n't like it much , and it drew his throat together so he was n't sure he could speak . They went back out to the kitchen , Marjory pacing along in her stocking feet , more quickly than before . She worked more quickly in the kitchen , too , and hummed one of the tunes the orchestra had played that night , but broke off in the middle of it and turned to him . They kissed for a long time . Then , just as suddenly , she broke away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , light , and they went back into the other room . While they drank , Marjory kept rubbing her foot and ankle against himftly . In the middle of this second drink they found themselves looking at each other , the talking stopped and forgotten . This look was different too . It went way back in , and was a little frightening . Tim held his breath , and Marjory stopped petting hint with her foot . Tim put his drink down and leaned toward her , and she sighed , the way she had in the kitchen that first night , and slowly put her drink down too . But then she held hire off , in a way that was like holding onto hint too , and whispered , as if there were someone else who might hear her , " Turnp224the light out , please , Timmy . " She began to stretch out on the couch as he stood up to turn out the light . She looked frightened , and her eyes were very big . It was the first time they had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it came on , it seemed to Tim that this was n't going to be the same . Marjory devoured him frantically with her hands and her kissing and her writhing . She kept whisperingto him , not only about love , to make him say so too , but about wanting him . But then it did n't happen . Instead , she began pushing at him , frightened , not angry , and whispering , more wildly than anything else she had whispered , " No , Timmy , no , no , I ca n't , " over and over , and , " Turn on the light , Timmy . Please , Timmy , turn on the light . " He sat on the edge of the couch for a minute , shaken and discouragedand disgusted , but just as glad nothing had come of it , too . Then he got up and turned on the light . Marjory was lying there , huddled up in a ball , with her face hidden , and she was crying . Later , after he had comforted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starring to cry again . It was all queer and faraway , as if it did n't have anything to do with him at all . When he started ! ionic lie felt heavy and exhausted , but also devoted to her in a melancholy way , through which came little waves of weary bliss . After that they made love on the couch often , in the same tormenting way . Tim got to thinking about it when he was alone . If he stayed late at her house , they would both be white and exhausted , saying good night at the door , and although she would still cling to him , she would be quiet in his arms and they would kiss only gently , and her lips would be cool . Then he would walk home feeling heavy and nervous and sadly blissfulthat way . In this mood , walking through the darkness , or the shadows and moonlight , the would convince himself repeatedly that he was wildly in love with her , but still he was always doingthat , convincing himself . Often , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he wanted to cry out or weep , he loved and wanted her so much , and he would tell her this . He had no trouble telling her he loved her any more . He was telling her a11p225the time . But even then a great part of him remained heavy and asleep . There was never anything between them but this unfinishedlove making , and Marjory 's hunger for something , which was always pulling at him . They shared no other yearning . He never discovered anything she was really interested in except proofs that he loved her . They talked most often about getting married some time , and how they would live . She never seemed to think about his music in this planning , but only to have ideas about what they would do when he was n't working at the music , and even these ideas changed all the time . There was only one thing constant about them . She never imagined them living anywhere except in a city , a much bigger city than Reno , and all the things they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They spent most of the time discussing how they felt about each other , and how the love making would fit into this amusing life in the city . Sometimes this would seem all right to Tim too , and he would have just as many ideas as Marjory , but at other times he would feel very sick and unhappyabout it , and keep thinking of how many times they had already said everything they were saying , and then he would have trouble saying the right things , or sounding as if he meant anything he said . They had many little arguments that did n't matter much , but there were eight or ten times in the year and a half they were seeing each other all the time , when Marjory broke out fiercely against Tim himself , instead of just using him as a lay figure to resist her indefinite unrest and desire . Rachel was the cause of all the outbursts , but they came so far apart , and each incident was really so trivial , no matter what Marjory made of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Tim himself believed there was something important behind them . Once , for instance , they were sitting in Mrs. H ale 's car at the curb on Virginia Street , and Rachel went past on the sidewalk , by herself , hugging her books . Tim did n't say anything or move . He just watched Rachel until she was hidden by unimportantpeople coming the other way . Yet something roused up in him and fled out after her , hunting her in and out of thep226crowd , and for an instant all the little trees in the shining fringe of the wilderness were moved by a brief wind of hope and danced gleefully . In that instant he was also another being , heavy , restless , feeble and left behind , but the moment passed so quickly that he did n't even remember what he had felt . It just seemed to him that all at once the activity of the street had become a sad pantomime to behold , and he thought of big , impersonal reasons for this sadness , like the late sun on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destinies of all humanity . Something must have shown in his face , though , in that moment when the chase broke out from him . Mrs. Hale dropped them off at the house and drove on to dinner somewhere , and when they went in , Marjory at once began to put loud records on , with the volume turned way up , and to prowl . She did n't even make an ally of the house . She was by herself , hard and informed and distant in her tight sports clothes , looking at him with the eyes that knew so much , and mocked it all . Tim tried to draw her down onto the couch beside him and kiss her . He did n't really feel very much like making love to her , but he could n't stand to have her prowling to that loud noise and staring at him so contemptuously . She braced herself against his pulling , without speaking or struggling , and he let her go , and after this little defeat , he felt guilty for no reason that he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still thinking about Rachel , but he did n't think she could know that . The room became deeply melancholy , as in the autumn that always surrounded his thoughts of Marjory , the late , gray , unmovingautumn in a wilderness without magic . " Margy , " he said finally , " let 's play something we can listen to . " Marjory was prowling again , and she did n't stop . " I like this , " she said , without looking at him . He tried again , a few minutes later , while she was putting on another record . " Margy , " he said , " what 's got into you ? Come here . " He said it very gently , pleading . It made him feel like a faker , the way he said it . " Let me alone , " she said.  |p227He  watched her while the new record started . She went to the other window , and stood there , looking out . He got up to go , and she turned around . " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stopped in the doorway . " Sec what ? " " See the way you always look at Rachel Wells ; the way you stare at her . " " I do n't stare at her . Why on earth should I stare at her ? " " You do . You stare at her all the time . " " When did I stare at her ? I did n't even know I was looking at her . " " Oh , did n't you ? " " No , " he said . She shook her head impatiently . " You still have a case on Rachel , do n't you ? " " No , " he said . " Margy , " he pleaded , coming back toward her and getting ready to take hold of her . She moved away from him sharply , twisting her shoulders , as if disgusted at the thought of his touch . " Do n't paw me , " she said . They did n't succeed in mending this rift at the moment , yet Tim , instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life while he walked home , wondered if it was really true that he had n't got over Rachel , and was faintly encouraged by the notion , as if something small were set free in him , and he believed it might grow up and be happy and strong . But when the phone rang during supper , and Marjory 's voice said , " Wo n't you come down tonight , Tim ? Just for a little while , anyway ? " he felt that great troubles had been lifted from him . He was devoted , in a stern and monkish way , to his devotionto her . He went down after supper , and Marjory was unusuallygentle and affectionate.  | About the Difficultyof Offering Homage to an Immortal Incar-nateIT WAS to this Tim of Marjory Hale 's that Rachel could finally speak before she was spoken to . She spoke one Friday afternoon in the fall of their senior year . They both took physics the last period , in the lecture room and lab in the south side of the tower . The windows of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed only the blue Indian-summer sky and the yellow treetops bending slowly in the air , unless you went right up to them and looked down . The lab was brightened by the light reflected from the treetops , and among the slowly moving students , in whom budded vast ideas of space and force , many things shone , excitedeyes , troubled eyes , metal wires and instruments of glass and steel and brass . Slow hands printed and figured forth the symbols of intimations and of faith upon blue-lined graph paper , or the special paper for lab reports . The expectations of the week-end , which were always there on Friday afternoon , trembledquiet ly in the air too , and sometimes brought on little flurriesof whispering . " These expectations were unusually strong in Tim this Friday , though he would n't let himself make much of the reason . He was the number-one tennis player of the school now , and tomorrow the Western Tournament at Carson began , and he was playing all three events , which meant mixed doubles with Rachel , for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had felt freer as this expectation grew . He was slow at his experiment with a tuning fork , because he kept looking up to watch Rachel at her table by the French windows in front , and every time he looked down again after watching her , the figureson his paper , and even the careful drawing showing the progress of vibrations in the air , appeared strange , and he had to get acquainted with them all over again . This confusion ofp229the mysteries made him five minutes later than the rest of the class in putting away his instruments and leaving his papers on the desk in the teacher 's office . He came out into the hall by himself , and it was there that Rachel spoke first . " Tim , " she said . So she had been waiting for him . The hall was dark . There were no windows in it , but only the three doors to chemistry , biology and physics , and the doors to chemistry and biology were already closed . The only light , except the little that came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closing . Yet it seemed to him he 'd never in his life seen anything so clearly as he saw Rachel standing there alone , hugging her books , and speaking his name first . A subdued but golden and commemorativelight , like the glow in a cathedral , swam in the hall . " Hello , Rachel , " he said . " Do you have any way to get out to Carson tomorrow ? " she asked . " Not yet , " he said . She moved toward the stairs , but slowly , expecting him to walk beside her . " Do you want to ride out with me ? " she asked . " We 're suposedto play at nine , and nobody else is going out that early , guess . " " Do you want to ? " she had asked . To this delightfully ridiculous question he answered gravely , " Thanks . That would be all . " In order to walk down the stairs side by side , they had to move closer together . They touched several times , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come for you about seven-thirty , " Rachel said . " It 'll be retry chilly still at nine o'clock . We 'll need a long warm-up . I ways need a long warm-up anyway . " " I do , too , " Tim said . This was more wonderful nonsense . Nobody could stand up inst the kind of tennis he could play now , without any nn-up at all . But he must n't startle her out of this unusual nfidence , this nibbling in the open meadows of the world , byp230any hint of the amazing difference he saw between seven-thirty in the morning and eight or eight-thirty . There was no one else in the main hall when they got down to it . School emptied out fast on Friday afternoons . They stood there for several minutes , talking about their chances in the mixed according to their probable opponents round-by-round , always admitting , so as not to tempt fate , that they might not even get by the first round , and then they walked out together , and Rachel said good night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , because of his loyalty to Marjory , he convinced himself that his amazing liveliness , and the fleet running of his heart over the yellow hills was on account of the autumn in the streets of Reno . When he got home , he went up to his room and took out his violin and played a series of tumultuous , flashing improvisations which he told himself represented the dance of the swallows in the infinite , five-o'clock air above the golden trees and the gray streets . Tim was always nervous before a track meet or a tennis tournament , but the next morning his nervousness was also happy . He got up at six and stood in his bedroom window , looking at morning in the valley . He was full of winged and wordless psalms . The blessing of God was on the hills , and the golden poplars burned on His altar . When Tim had as much of the world outside as he could hold , he bathed quickly in cold water , rubbed himself with a rough towel until he burned , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put all his tennis things together and took them down into the front hall . Breakfast was also a kind of sacrament . His mother moved quietly and wearily hack and forth between the stove and the table , and his sister spoke softly , full of dreams about her wed ding , which was only a month off . His father ate silently and did n't look up . Yet they were all part of the familiar wonder which had turned new this morning . The leaves on the vine over the kitchen windows were a winy red , and glowed like stained glass in the sun . The light entering between them made a mobile pattern on the worn oilcloth of the table and on the linoleum on the floor , and single , dainty beams struck twinklingp231upon spoons and wet cereal bowls . Tim ate and drank slowly , without saying much , and held down his desire to jump , shout , yodel and embrace his astonished family . Even when the horn blew out front , he arose with apparent calm and even indifference . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him her benediction before a kind of battle she did n't understand , except that her son was entered in it . " Good luck , Timmy , " she said . Even Willis was gracious and interested , in his own way . He expressed great contempt for tennis , but actually he took a terribleinterest in anything , clear down to double solitaire with M r . Hazard , which entailed the alternative of winning or being a sucker . His mockery of Tim had entirely changed tone since Tim had become a repeat winner in the mile and half-mile , and had demonstrated to him one evening , with illustrations from an actual race , that there was a lot in common between jockey-g and directing oneself through a foot-race . In this realmillis was even a scientist and a philosopher , and immediately nderstood the most abstruse theory and analysis . So this communionhad improved his opinion of tennis too , although there has n't a word said about tennis . Willis always slept naked . He now appeared at the head of he stairs , naked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhausted from some alley activity which had lasted aril two o'clock the night before . " Good luck , bum , " he yelled . " Bring home muchos des cups and stuff . " Tim acknowledged the encouragement almost without hearingit , for the door was open now , and there was Rachel in a chow sweater , sitting in her blue roadster in the sunlight . It as the same sweater in which , in a previous incarnation , she ad sat on the green bench under the cottonwood at Wingfield rk . Rachel was superstitious about the yellow sweater , althoughshe would n't admit it . For three days , in her first county urnament , she had warmed up in the yellow sweater , and each iv she had won her match . The fourth day she had warmed p in a different sweater , and lost . Now , although the sweaterp232had been mended in many places , and was worn thin and faded , she always wore it before she played a match that mattered to her . With the yellow sweater on , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rachel which always preceded the real match . She waved to Tim when he appeared in the doorway , and when he came out she said , " Put your things in back with mine , Tim . " Tim opened the turtle-back and carefully placed his old , kicked-about suitcase beside hers , which was small , neat and shiny . He touched her suitcase with his hand , and placed his where it might touch hers all the way to Carson . He placed his rackets against hers also , that they might absorb virtue and becomededicated to the impossible . He contemplated the finished arrangement for a moment , closed the turtle-back and climbed in beside Rachel . He waved to his mother , and Rachel waved also , though she had never seen Mrs. Hazard before . She too was filled with the elixir of this morning . The blue roadster swung round in the bars of sunlight-and-poplar shadow , and fled off along the empty street through the elixir . " I 'll have to step on it , " Rachel said . " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even turned her head to look at him , so they could laugh together . The city was only dreamily astir as yet . Even the downtown section appeared clean and empty and filled with windows which observed the coming day with great hope . At such an hour in such a day , the power of the trees of Reno was great . Their certainty of forever , their knowledge that the river of life was brimming and rippling silently through God 's pastures , reached even to the intersection of Virginia and Second . On the South Virginia Road the shadows of the poplars pointed west , as they had pointed east the evening of Billy Wilson'sparty . There is a considerable difference between the shadowsof poplars pointing west and pointing east . Up in their deep-blue sky , the brown , monster Sierras , drowsy with autumn , reclined upon the edge of the world , and beyond them was the ocean of space . They were resting with thin veins of yellow aspens in their folds . It overwhelmed Tim to be shotp233forth in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains when he was already dangerously full of delightand ardor . He needed to pour forth , in a sacred service of music , poetry and dance , the ecstasy of being beside Rachel , who sat on a pillow in order to see the road ahead , and drove so lightly and fleetly , although only the toe of her small and holy foot , flexed like a dancer 's , touched the throttle . But even if it had n't been for Marjory , such a festival was impossible . It was a work to wear a genius down to bone , and no creative work will grow in a void . There must be first of all the faith that it is wanted ; there must be the earth to its seed , the valley for its river . Not that Tim thought of his trouble within such narrow limits . When he was beside Rachel like this , he did n't think at all . I le did n't even think that he loved her . He could n't permit the words on account of Marjory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't begin to express the joyous demolition of imself which took place in Rachel 's presence . He felt simply he ungovernable and inexpressible flood rising , as if he wereanding in the bottom of a deep canyon and looking up helpsslyat a great crack opening across the face of a dam . He feltc imminent doom of that flood which is most terrible , the nnihilation of self by shame . He knew that unless something happened which had never happened yet , something which gave m i the words to tell her how he really felt in a way she would understand and believe , he was going to begin to talk anyway . f only he could feel all bad about the habit of trying to tell cr what could n't be told , maybe he could hold it , but he could n't feel all bad . He 'd feel the dam cracking , and he 'd he inspair , but he 'd go right on feeling wonderful and excited because he was with her , and hopeful that this time somethingwould make the words come right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You always talk too much hen you feel this way . You 'll feel terrible afterwards , all ached out . You 've got to play tennis , so shut up . " I lc also told : itself , " You 're in love with Marjory . Besides getting ready to talk endlessly about the first thing you start on , whatever it is ,  |p234you  're already being false to Marjory , and Marjory is already very unhappy about something or everything . She meant a whole lot besides just jealousy when she said she saw you lookingat Rachel . She meant that was just another little touch of everything in the world she was always losing or not even finding . " More desperately he said to himself , " Which matters the most , anyway , pouring out your insides to somebody who does n't give a damn for you , no matter what you think of her , or keeping yourself whole for somebody who is dying because things are always falling apart for her ? " In the last agony , he cried to himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hell do sports mean , here where you can see her and hear her , and could even touch her ? " " Remember that St. Mary 's game last fall ? " he asked Rachel . Rachel was intent upon silently playing as much of Rachel vs . Rachel as she could before they got to Carson . " No , " she said , " I do n't think I saw it . " " Yes , you did , " Tim said . " I was there , and I saw you . " He was going to tell her all the details of having seen her there , which was the kind of thing she hated even worse than his going on about sports . I le never forgot the details of seeing her anywhere . Because of her presence , such details took place in a supernatural light , which awakened an extra and unforgetting sense . in hint . Rachel stopped him from doing that , anyway . " Maybe I was , " she said stiffly , " but I do n't remember it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing was that they used a lot of short , over-the-line passes which were really something to see . St. Mary 's did , I mean . There were always a lot of players in there , so you could n't tell who was who , and besides , all the plays started off the saute formation and they all looked like they 'd be line plunges , and then this passer would rear up back there and let these passes go . They were never very long . They 'd make only three , four , five yards a play on them , except for once in a while a break off one of them like they were working for . But they never missed , and even three yards is enough if you can keep on making it . " There was only once , " he went on , " I ever saw anythingp235prettier . That was in the Utah game two years ago . The Utes had a lot of big fellows , rangy , six feet three or four . They did n't look very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and smooth , plenty smooth . But maybe they were heavier than they looked . They were wearing those plain , one-color jerseys , you remember , bright red , and a one-color jersey like that , no matter what color it is , makes a man look thinner . The stripes , like Nevada wears , make them look heavier . So maybe the Utes were a lot heavier too . I do n't know . But that pass attack of theirs was the most beautiful thing I 've ever seen . I still do n't see how anybody could stop a pass attack like that . They 'd shift in the line just before the play began , and you never knew , when they broke , who was eligible to take the pass . Sometimes even the center would be on the end . They 'd go out all distances . It was a kind of buckshot affair , I guess . The passer just picked any man he wanted to and let it fly and . . . " He went on . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't stop . After such debauches he could hardly ever remember what he had said , except that he had said a lot of it , in almost the same words , before . The only kind of talk anyone can remember is the small , fact kind about something that must be done right away , or the great talk of inspiration , where the outpouring is drawn by a warmth of true desire . Even the way he talked when he got like this did n't sound like himself . Yet against this shame and failure , he could only talk harder , as if by mere volume and energy he could force Rachel to see that it was all a gigantic praise of her . He became a fountain of the names of teams , of dates , of records , of comparisons . He even described games he had never seen , with a wealth of incident and color no mere game ever had . To hear the fervor and massivenessof his eulogies to the great , or to the practically unknownwhom he made great by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought there was no room in his soul save for the love of athletes . Rachel said once , like a faint cry in a hurricane , " I do n't care too much about football . I just like to sec a game once in a while . "  |p236Tim  did n't feel this as a rebuke to football as a subject , but as a rejection of what he really wanted to tell her . Terribly hurt , and seeing the whole flood coming down now , he still kept going , except that by means of a star quarterback who was also a star forward , he switched to basketball . All over the Great Basin and the Pacific Slope , his gods threw beautiful baskets from the middle of the floor and whipped in one-handers from the corners on the dead run . " Boy , he was coming down the left side-line , wide open , and he can travel too . He made a push-pass to Hank coming down the center , and then cut in front of the guard and took the pass back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sucked that guard clear into the free-throw lane on a fake pivot and then spun around him on the outside and hung up the basket going under . A left-handed shot at that . Holy cow , was it pretty ! I thought the old gym would come down for sure . The crowd was all over the floor and gone crazy . That was the shot that won the semi-final from Elko . Remember ? " " No , it was n't , " Rachel said , trembling with the effort of speaking so cruelly . " I saw that game , and it was Hank 's long shot won it . " She looked straight ahead at the road while she spoke . Then Tint could not remember , but was sure she was right . Without a word , he prayed for a moment that she would hear back of the words of his traitor mouth . What he meant could n't be put in any words ; it had to be the things themselves , the world that was more beautiful because it was so brief because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much faster because of her reprimand . Actually he covered his wound by going on , after a minute , about a game with Brigham Young . When he had thus obscured the fact that she had trapped him , he switched to track by way of an end who had also been a high jumper . " Remember the high jumps in that meet ? " he insisted . " I hardly ever go to track meets , " Rachel said . " They 're so dull ; all waiting around , or things you ca n't even see . " " You went to some , " came out before Tim could stop it.  | " You used to go with Red and sit in his car until his race came , and then come down in the stands . " There he was , telling her what she did again . " Well , what if I did ? " Rachel said . " Anyway , " Tim went on heavily , and his mouth described the high jump in eager detail , while he shrank from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sake , Tim , " Rachel burst out , " do n't you ever think about anything but sports ? " She trembled with the fury and cruelty of saying this . Tim bent double within , torn by the unfairness of her accusation . All the things he really thought about her , the legends , the music , moments of the adorationtoo vast to take form , poured through his mind , and yet came out as just a last , thin trickle of the same terrible flood . " Have you ever seen this Oregon fellow play , the one that 's coming , the intercollegiate doubles champ ? " " I do n't want to hear about tennis either , " Rachel said quickly . " You should n't talk about it before you play . It makes you nervous . " This blocked the very present moment , and stopped him , and then it was the same as ever in him , exhaustion and black shame . He sat stiffly beside her , trying to keep his hands from giving him away , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the weathered ranch houses in the pass , and the bright trees making shadows on them , and the round , brown heads of the hills above , the beautiful , self-contained world from which he was now an exile by his own fault . They sped through the little valley beyond the pass and climbed Washoe Hill . As they caste over the summit , Rachel said , " I love this valley . " It was kind of her to say it , because then he could look at the big valley , which was on her side , and indirectly he could look at her . He too loved this big valley with its little lake and its big lake , and the red steers in the meadows that sloped up to the foot of the mountains where Bowers ' Mansion kept its unhappy memories behind its yellow poplars . He nodded . Once he was mopped , it was hard to say anything at all . He said very little the rest of the way to Carson , just trying to answer what shep238said , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was with her , but it was only when he was n't with her that this fact hurt . He tried to think about Marjory , but she did n't matter now . As this kind of a slave to Rachel , he played in the tournament as well as he ever had , and sometimes better , especially in the mixed doubles . In the singles there were moments when the game was n't enough , and the heavy , defeated sadness would conic back , not only because she did n't care what happened to him in the singles , but also because his sins spread out , and it seemed to him that he would never be any good at anything . Right in the middle of a rally it would come over him that he would never be any good at anything , and that he ought to kill himself , and so at least stop being in the way and being a fool . Then points , and sometimes even a game or two , would go by before he became frightened byhisweakness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points that he would be was still shaky . In the mixed doubles , with Rachel beside . him , he had no such lapses . He was thinking about her all the time ; he was doing everything for her . A point won against them became a grievance , and he played for revenge . When Rachel said , " Oh , nice , Timmy , " or , " Pretty shot , ' lint , " or when they rushed the net together and he put one away quickly , and she looked at him with that quick brightness of triumph in her face which meant " We , " he would be flooded by a light , joyous strength which would carry him over his head for a game or more . He dropped out in the quarter finals of the singles , hut in the mixed doubles they went to the finals , and were defeated by the first seeded team from the coast only after a long , three-set battle . None of the other wonderful things he had dreamt about happened , though . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same table , when the players ate at the hotel . He did n't dance with her at the parties , or take her to a show , or even sit in the roadster with her and watch other matches , excepting a couple of times for a few minutes before they were to play together . The tournament lasted for three days , and he knew wherep239Rachel was all the time , but he was never with her . He sat byhimself in the hotel lobby , and brooded about the sins of hismouth , or went up to his room and lay on the bed and brooded about the sins of his mouth . Sometimes he would lie there staring at the ceiling and inventing a series of conversations inwhichhe proved to her that he was really more moved by many other things in life than he was by the deeds of any athlete , and also that it was possible for him not to do all the talking , but only his part , and that very cleverly or wisely . It was hard to start this imagining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for which atonement was necessary but not possible , all the wonderful sporting deeds which he described with convictionand belief , but recognized now as untrue , as just plain lies . When he made them , they were not lies ; they were great , spontaneous improvements upon the limited possibilities of the flesh . But when he remembered them , they were just lies , and they made him see how she must feel that everything else he said in such an unquenchable rush was just a kind of lying . He was very unhappy about these lies . He would go over them , and correct each one of them in his mind . Then he would feel better , and could begin to construct the brief conversations which she enjoyed . If he was left alone in his room long enough , he would even succeed in finding words which seemed to declare his love truly , whole passages of great and convincing poetry , or he would compose music which would prove to her how it really was with him . After such a success , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in the blue roadster in the immense and lonely dusk of the valleys , after the last match was played . There was nothing in the world which he wanted so much as to ride home with Rachel in the big dusk . Over every mile of the road , which was much too short , hung the magic of chance . The word , the feeling , the scene they both looked at on such a ride , might perform the nuptial rite of their minds , might send her forth to meet him . He would become so restless thinkingabout all the places and ways for this to happen , that he would get up and pad around the room in his socks , or put on his shoes and go outside and walk in the night in the dark sidep240streets of Carson , under the big trees under the looming mountains . He did n't think of Marjory very often . Nevertheless , when the tournament was really over , he got a ride home with Ham Brown , and that night he went down to Marjory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from her for a long time . It was comforting to be where he was n't always wrong . False SpringIN FEBRUARY came a day that should have waited a month or two . There had been premonitions of it for a week . Old snow on lawns and hillsides sank under its own weight , let the earth show through , and made innumerable , tiny , underground streams , which silently swelled the ditches , the ponds and the river , wearing the ice gray and drawing it away from the banks . People walking along the streets were full of indefinite yearningsand expectations . Sometimes they would stand still and look up at the trees , still bare against a clouded sky , and cock their heads slightly , as if they had just that moment caught one strain of a distant and delectable music which had been going on for a long t hue . I ) ogs gathered and ran in erratic packs across lawns and up alleys . Then there was a night in which fell a quiet snow of huge , wet flakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their windows , and seeing the snow , felt that they had been mysteriouslyand enormously wronged , and went back to bed unhappy . But it was not the snow which had made them restless and started their dreams . There was something else going on in the night . The snow melted almost as fast as it fell . When daylightreached over the city , there was only a thin covering of snow on roofs and streets , the Truckee flowed black and smooth over its dams , and on the ponds there were left only a few dwindling islands of ice like thin , bad glass . By ten o'clock windows were opened in the school , and a smell of wet sod andp241pavement was wafted in , and the sounds of running gutters , dripping eaves and sparrows bickering . The waters- swelled in the halls and class rooms too , rivers of whispering , chattering , laughing , song snatches and irrepressible bits of dancing , lakes of silent dreaming and staring . Even the teachers turned their heads to look out the windows , and faltered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exultant branches lifted into the blue sky , and then began again to speak of angles , bivalves , participles and amendments in voices which gave those sturdy topics a peculiarly legendary quality . At noon the last snow was gone from the ground , and the last thread of mist from the sky . When school let out in the afternoon , the streets and sidewalks were dry . Tim left his books in his locker , drifted out onto the front steps , and waited for his irresolution to become a desire , which it did n't . Marjory had been away for two days with her mother , but Pauline had told him at noon that she was back now . She would expect him to come down . He descended the steps and began to walk slowly toward the middle of town . As he turned the corner from Fourth into Sierra , a car pulled up at the curb beside him . It was the blue roadster , and Rachel was alone in it . " Hi , Tim . Want a ride ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now beyond a doubt the fiddles of spring in the streets of Reno . Fortunately he was stricken nearly dumb . " Sure , " he said , and climbed in beside her . " Where you going ? " she askedWhere is there to go when you are already there ? " Oh , nowherein particular , " he said . " I was going downtown . " " O.K. " Ile had no luck . She found a parking place on Virginia Street the first try , and jumped out and slammed the door . I lc got out slowly . It was very sad in the shade on this side of the street . " You going down to Marjory 's ? " Rachel asked . " No , " he said , which was true now . " No , I 've got a lot of work to do . I guess I 'd better go home . "  | " You wait , " Rachel said . " I just have to get something for Mother . I wo n't be a minute . Then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shadow on this side of the streetglowed . " Or do you want to come with me ? " she asked . And the glow went off like a rocket . It exploded high above the street and showered the beautiful people on the sidewalk with falling light . Rachel 's feet twinkled along the sidewalk in the falling light , and he walked beside her , proud , but embarrassed by the celebration going on inside him . The whole street could hear those explosions . In a moment the whole street would cry , " Oh , look , look . Tim Hazard is shooting off his heart for Rachel Wells . " Rachel stopped because of what shesaw in a window . " Oh , I like that , " she cried . " That " was a soft gray dress with a short gray jacket which had loose sleeves , like those of a monk 's robe , and was trimmed with a downy gray fur . It was hung upon an evil plaster body which had no head and no arms and an iron pipe instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering an offering to spring which W:IS little short of madness . " Is n't it lovely , Tint ? " " Tina stopped looking at the plaster body , and imagined Rachel in the gray dress . " Swell , " he said . She led him in , and he sat on a slippery leather seat and waited . After a few minutes she emerged from among the shadows and mirrors and stood before him , the delicate bones of her ankles together , her arms held away from her body , and looked down at the dress and then looked at him . She even turned once around , slowly , like a mannequin . " Do you like it , Tim ? " she asked . He wriggled a little and said , " Sure . It 's swell . " She assumed an attitude of indignation , one foot forward , and one hand upon her hip . " Tim , you 're an old dummy , " shesaid . " No , " he said stiffly . " Really , it 's swell . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fur looks swell on you . "  |p243She  looked at him curiously for a moment , not thinking about the dress . " Tim , you 're funny sometimes , " she said . Then she swung about once again , but quickly , and said , " Since you 're so crazy about it , I 'll have to get it , " and disappeared once more among the mirrors and shadows . He sat there , carefully not looking at the girdles and silk underclothesupon dead busts like the one in the window , and silk stockings and high-heeled shoes upon shapely legs without bodies , and took her words apart and put them together again in hopes of making more of them than he suspected she had meant . Nevertheless , having sat in this Parthenon of the female and seen her turn before him , showing him a dress of which he was jealous because she liked it so much , he was full of understandingabout the everlasting beauty of woman . Rachel came out in her school clothes , with the dress in a gray box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but also she took his arm , and squeezed it , and laughed at him . They went out onto the sidewalk that way . Then Rachel drove around by Court Street and down through the park so they could look at the tennis courts , but the nets were n't up . Still , they talked about tennis and the coming summer , so that the ay felt more like spring than ever , and as they approached Fifth Street , going north on Virginia , Rachel said a thing of great understanding and beauty . " You do n't really want to go home yet , do you , Tim ? " she id . " Let 's drive out the Purdy Road . " So they drove all the way out to the Dry Lake valley , and Rachel stopped the car there , where the road was built up , like . r railroad embankment , and they got out and stood side by side , rla hough not quite touching , and looked at the work of the sunsetin the east . The water was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it was spread wide and looked like a real ke . The low hills around it were piebald with snow , and the  --  till air was turning coldly toward night . The hill , the light , Ow shadows of everything , reached east toward the last white sliver of mountains . The reaching was in Rachel 's face also . She ' lied at Tim shyly , just for an instant , and made the quick242P244smile . If he could have made that instant into an hour , she would have understood . It was that close . But a cold breath from the west came over them and she turned back , and the meaning of everything changed . A bank of dark , revolving clouds was rapidlyreaching into the sky from behind the near barrier of the western mountains . It had a cold , brilliant edge , and a sunburst spread up from behind it . " It 's going to snow again , " Tim said . " I guess it is , " Rachel said . Yet the memory of that imminent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had kept him from even wanting to talk on the way back , and when he came into the kitchen , late for supper , it protected him from his father 's comment . But then the phone rang . Once Grace had answered the phone wheneverit rang during a meal , because she sat nearest the hall door , but Grace was n't there any more . It made a great difference not to have Grace at the I lazards ' table . Each of them had a whole side of the table to himself now , but there was a bigger space than that . Something was gone that nobody but Mrs. Hazard had known was there before , something which had made them more together at the table . Mrs. I Lazard was always searching for this something , and she was beginning to feel very old and tired without it . The phone rang again . Tim got up and went into the hall and answered it . It was Marjory , and she spoke very quickly and clearly and emphatically . " Tim , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone down on its shelf and pulled the kitchen door shut . He realized now that he had been planning to run or walk all over the city tonight . He had n't done that for a long time , not to count ; only coming and going from Marjory 's house , or from band practices . " Well , are you coming ? " Marjory asked . The old heaviness began to settle in him again . Nobody was talking in the kitchen . Usually , when one of them went to the phone , his mother would lead the others to talk about something , so they would n't seem to be listening , but tonight she P245was too tired , and did n't try . Tim believed they could all hear even what Marjory was saying . " I do n't know , " he said . " I have . . . " " Tim , I want to talk to you . Do you understand ? You wo n't have to stay long , I assure you , if that 's what 's worrying you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the scornful downcurveof her mouth , yet all he really resented was her breaking the peace of the Dry Lake valley . " I 'll see you tomorrow afternoon , " he said , trying , for the benefit of the kitchen , to make his voice sound as if he were stating his part of some friendly agreement . " No , I do n't care to wait , thank you . I said tonight . " After a moment she asked sharply , " Do you hear me , Tim ? " " All right , " he said . " I 'll be down . " She did n't speak again , but hung up abruptly . When he went back to the table , he could see they all knew the phone call had n't been the same as usual , but nobody said anything . Even Willis did n't do more than give him a curious look and then go on eating . There had been a queer , blessed , absent-minded streak in Willis lately . Sometimes he even seemed to be looking seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things about him , and without any militant purpose . He stayed home a lot more than he ever had before too , and sat around in the living room doing nothing restlessly . Mrs. Hazard was worried about this , but she would just say softly to Tim , where Willis could hear , " Timmy , Willis must have found a girl , after all , " and Willis would only say , " Nuts , " without any heart in it . Tim went out onto the porch after supper , and Willis followed him . " What 's the matter ? " he asked . " Is old coffin-puss griped about something ? " " I do n't know , " Tim said . He did n't mind the insult to Marjory . Willis was always making them , so he was used to them , but now he would n't have minded much anyway . The heavy , tired feeling was increasing so definitely , like a physical burden P246being let down onto his shoulders , and while he still rance bered very freshly how he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snowy mountains , that he was beginning to compare the two sensations . " Do n't bend , " Willis pleaded . " For Chrissakes , do n't bend , " he almost pleaded . " She could haunt ghosts , " he added . But when Tim just stood there looking at the pale curve of the race-track fence in the dusk across the street , Willis said , " Well , do n't mind me . It 's none of my business . " He had changed a lot , all right . He did n't like it to be obvious , though . " God loves a lot of funny things too , " he said loudly , and went back into the house . Only he used to sing or yodel or whistle after a crack like that , and now he did n't . Tim rode down to Marjory 's on his bike , and left the bike against the stoop . He had to ring the doorbell three times before Marjory opened the door . lie hardly recognized her then . She was wearing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder straps , and a pair of heavy , black earrings , and she was holding a pair of long , black gloves in one hand . Her eyebrows were changed too , thinner and darker and sharp , like bent blades , and her mouth was painted very red and bigger and more curved than it really was . He was abashed by her strangeness , hut she just stood there looking at him , so he spoke first anyway . " Hello , " lie said . That gave her an advantage to begin with , because she did n't even answer , but just turned around and stalked back into the living room , leaving him to close the door . He closed it and went in after her . I le could feel that they were alone in the house , except for the secrets between it and Marjory . He had guessed that Marjory was alone when she was phoning , for that matter . There was only the one going-out light in the living room . Marjory sat down in the middle of the couch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands in her lap , and stared at him . Her eyes were different than he had ever seen them before , too , neither dark with hunger nor pale with P247old wisdom , but full of a shocking anger that did n't belong to any particular age . Because of her manner on the phone , he believed that she had been storing this speechless anger for a long time . Backed by the old house , she was preparing to slay him exactly and neatly for some reason . Finally she said , too quietly , and like an older person , " I think perhaps you owe me an explanation , Tim Hazard . " Before he could think of anything to say , she asked , still very quietly , " You do n't really care very much about- me , do you ? You never have , have you ? " This was a terrible thing to try to answer , when she was looking at him like that . He had never even answered it to himself . " Of course I do , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Marjory . " I lc did n't care whether this was true or not . He just wanted to say something that would make her more like herself , so they could really talk , if they had to . " I 've made a fool of myself about you , " Marjory said . Tim had plenty of reasons for knowing that this was probably the hardest thing in the world to say , when you meant it , and Marjory sounded as if she meant it . He thought , in order not to feel how terribly she must be hurt to say those words , " Good God , you 'd think we were thirty and going to get married , or something . Would n't we sound silly if anybody heard this ! " " I do n't see what you mean , " he said . " Do n't you ? " she asked . " Well , everybody else does , " she said , letting the anger out just a little . Rachel stood on the edge of the highway in the late sunlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the little soldier , and her heart trembled for the world . The still , chilly air about her , in which he also stood , was full of thepromise of forever , which was like a multitude of soft wings beating . He desired to touch her , but was prevented by the ' knowledge of holiness . This came to him clearly , like something which was happening to him again .   " What does that matter ? " he answered Marjory , but not as if answering what she had said . Marjory stood up quickly and said , " If it does n't matter to you , I 'm sure it does n't to me . " She went across to the phonograph , and stood with her hands upon it , and her back turned to him . He did n't understand what he had said to provoke this open anger . He could n't even remember his words . She turned around and faced him . She tossed her head , as if to throw her hair back , although it was n't in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I have n't been out with anybody but you since we started going together . I 've just stayed here and waited for you , plenty of nights , when I could have gone out with somebody else if I 'd wanted to , and you know I have . " She sounded more her own age . She sounded as if she would cry if he did n't find out what to say to keep her from crying . " Sure you have , " he said gently , but then suddenly felt angry , as if he had been caught lying , and said quickly , " But I did n't ask you to , did I ? I 've said plenty of times you should go out when I have to play . " " I do n't want to quarrel , " Marjory said , being older again . " Only I 'm not going to look as if I were chasing you any longer . I 'm sick of it . " " What 's this all about , anyway ? " Tim asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No , I ca n't say I do . " Well , he could n't say he did . Rachel did n't care about him . It did n't mean anything at all , because nothing could come of it . There was nothing real there ; only what he felt . " I was going to come down this afternoon , " he began . " Oh , were you , " she said , not asking a question . " Well , you can go to the devil , Tim Hazard , for all I care , " she said suddenlyand loudly . " I do n't give a damn where you go , do you hear ? I do n't give a damn . " He stared at her . " Do you hear me ? " she asked again . " I hear you , all right . "   " Good , " she screamed at him . " Good . I 'm glad you do . " She came up close to him , lifting her face almost against his , like another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know who you were with this afternoon ? Do you know where . I was ? I was in our car , right in front of that store . Do you even help her buy her clothes now ? " she asked . " No . Do n't try to tell me any nice stories , " she . said quickly . " I went in . You did n't see me , but I saw you , sitting there like a dope , while she showed off for you . The little bitch , " she said , like spitting . " All right , " she yelled , " go on and hit me . I 'd like it . It 's the only thing you have n't done . Go on ; I dare you to . " She thrust her chin out at him , offering her face to be struck . She appeared wildly joyous about this challenge . It seemed as if she really wanted to be hit . Tim was stunned by her grotesque and joyous fury , and her yelling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even thinking anything . Marjory relaxed . Her hands were trembling . " I did n't think you 'd dare , " she said . She turned away from him , but she went only a step or two , and then faced him again . " Pauline Chester called up just before I phoned you , " she said . Still without thinking , he set himself to withstand another attack . " Do you know why ? " she asked . " No , " he said . Because he spoke , he began to feel something . I le was overwhelmed by shame . " I do n't care , " he said . " I guess . . . " " Well , I do care , " Marjory said . " She called up just to laugh at me . Oh , she was my dearest friend , and everything . She just t Fought I ought to know . Yes , me , and everybody else in school t oo , " she said furiously . " Know what ? " Tim asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the Purdy Road , " Marjory said . She cause close to him Again , talking into his face . " And do n't try to tell me you P250did n't , " she said . " Pauline was out riding with Joe , and they saw you . " " Well , what of it ? " Tim said . " Is that any crime ? " I le knew he was dreaming himself , but he even started to explain . " She was going to give me a lift home , " he said , " and it was nice out , so we drove out to Dry Lake and back , that 's all . Is that ... " " Oh , yes ? " Marjory said quietly . " Do n't you lie to me , " she burst out . " Do n't you think I know what you go out the Purdy Road for ? " " Oh , nuts , " Tim said , because he could n't think of anything to say that would make any difference . She would just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he added . Marjory slapped him across the face with the black gloves . She raised them , and was going to hit him again . When some time had passed in a void , his eyes cleared slowly , and he could see . Marjory was bent queerly to one side in front of him . Her head was over on her shoulder . She was just standingthat way , without moving , and staring up at him . Gradually it came to him that she was afraid of something . Then he saw that she was in this queer position because he was holding her wrist and twisting her over like that . I lc must have caught hold of her when she started to hit him the second time . He was holding her much too hard , so hard that his knuckles were white . He became frightened . I lc did n't know how long he had been holding her like that . I le was n't sure whether or not he had done anything else to her . l le let go of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . She stood there looking at him , and rubbing her wrist with the other hand . " That hurt , " she said . " I 'm sorry , " he said thickly . " That does n't help it a great deal , " she said . He tried to find words to explain to her how he had happened to hurt her , but he could n't . Anything he said would sound like a lie . He had lost the right to say anything , by hurtinga girl . When you did a thing like that , there was nothing to say that was not just a bad excuse . P251Marjory was picking up the gloves , which she must have dropped when he grabbed her wrist . Then she stood there , holding them down by her side , and just waiting . He could n't look at her face . Finally she turned , and went quickly across the room to the table in the corner . When she was not so near , he could look up . She came back toward him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumphant . She was celebrating a great event which he did n't understand . She held the box out toward him . " You might as well take these with you , " she said . " I certainlysha n't want them . " He did n't want to take the box , whatever was in it . " What are they ? " he asked . She laughed at him . " A lot of things , all cheap , " she said . " To be exact , " she explained , exulting , " everything you 've ever given me that I could find . " He took the box , and held it as if he meant to put it down in a moment , or give it back to her . " Except this , " she said gaily , shaking her hair back , and holdingout her hand . It was a silver ring with his initials on it . She had been holdingit in her hand all the time . Now she held it out and waited ; until he had to extend his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into his hand without touching him . " Good evening , Mr. Hazard , " she said , making a little bow with just her head . She was smiling , and her eyes were full of the cool , knowing look . She was like her mother . She was actingjust as she had intended to , now . I le thought of the afternoon in the summer when they hadchosen the ring together , and he had felt very young and embarrassed , holding the ring while she slipped her finger into it , nd the jeweler stood there watching the ceremony and probably finding it very amusing , although his pale face , with the n1less , pince-nez glasses , had remained serious , and even bored . Without thinking what he was doing , he carefully put the sug into the box with the other things . He had guessed what they were , and did n't even know that he saw them as he put the  |p252ring  in . There was a silly little china dog , striped orange and black , like a tiger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of single blossoms saved out of corsages he had given her . There was one of his track letters and a scholarshippin . There was a silver compact and there were two braceletsand several pins for her hair and trinkets to wear on her sweater and dime-store toys she had seen in the windows . There were some folded sheets of paper which were probably foolish poems he had written for her . It was all stuff like that . " Is there anything missing ? " Marjory asked him . He realized that he was holding the box partly open and staring at the junk in it . He closed it quickly , as if he had really been caught trying to make sure she had returned everything . His face was very hot . Ile tried to appear at ease , to be even bored and taking his time , as he went across to the couch and put the box on it , but he felt stiff and ridiculous . " Will you please take them with you , " Marjory ordered . " I do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away if you want to . They 're yours . " I Ic did n't look at her , but went out into the hall . She followed him quickly , as if she had thought of something else to say , but then did n't say anything , but stood under the dim red light in the hall . I Ic stood with his hand on the door knob , looking at her . " Do n't let Inc keep you , " she said . He started to open the door . He ought to say something . Suddenly Marjory turned and ran back into the living room . He stayed there in the hall , holding the door partly open , and feeling very heavy and sad and undecided about everything . He could hear her crying in the living room . She cried hard and slow , as if the sobs were wrenched out of her at intervals , and she did her best between times to fight them down . It was like a boy crying , who felt even worse about crying than about the grief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , and went slowly back into the living room . She was lying on the couch , with her face buried on her arms and her legs drawn P253up . He was afraid he would start the dreadful noise and fighting all over again , but he could n't leave her like that . " Marjory , " he said . She did n't answer him , but just turned her head more away from him and burrowed it harder into her arm , and held the crying in so long that when it came again it was a deep burst that shook her . It trailed out in a little , irrepressible whimpering noise . He wanted to go . He 'd made his try . Why did n't he just go then , and leave her alone , and get this whole trouble over with ? It would n't do any good to start talking about it again . But he did n't . He knelt beside the couch . " Marjory . " But when he touched her , she drew up as quickly as a startled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner of the couch . " Do n't touch me , " she said . " Do n't you touch me . " The tears were running down her face , and she could n't look at him long , but quickly hid her face on her knees . She was cryingmore easily , though . He was still kneeling there , trying to get her to say something , when the doorbell rang . " Oh , my God , " Marjory moaned . Tim stood up . " Do you want me to answer it ? " " I do n't care , " she moaned . Suddenly she sat up and put her head back and shook it , to make her hair fall straight and free . At the same time she pounded quickly on her knees with both fists . Then she sat there and stared at him fiercely . " You need n't think I 'm crying about you , Tim Hazard , " she said . " It 's just about everything . I hate everything here . " The doorbell rang again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She got up quickly , and shook her head , and wiped her face on her arms like a boy . " I 'm going to marry him , if it 's any of your business , " she said softly . She sniffed and tossed her head again . " I 'm sick of kids . " P254She went out into the hall in the slow , ambling gait that went with the worldly look . Tim heard her open the door . " I was afraid I had the wrong house after all , " a man 's voice said . " Oh , no , quite the right one , " Marjory 's voice said brightly . here was a moment of silence , and then the man laughed softly and said , " Well , that 's good . " " If you 'll just wait in the living room , " Marjory said , " I wo n't be a minute . " Tim heard her feet on the stairs . Then he saw her leaning over the rail . " One of the kids is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Blakeford , Timmy Hazard , " she said . " I did n't break anything up , did I ? " the man asked . " Hardly , " Marjory said , laughing . She ran on up . The man came in . He looked at Tim curiously . Tim wished that old candy box full of trinkets and things was somewhere else . Mr. Blakeford nodded and said , " Hello , " and sat down on the couch beside the box . He looked as old as the man Mrs. Hale had gone out with , the evening of that first party . He was a lot like him , too , handsome and easy , but white , and soft , so that his high , narrow nose looked sharp on his full face . He was wearing evening clothes , and carrying a bowler . He laid the bowler on top of the box and drew out a silver cigarette case . " Smoke ? " he asked , opening it , and holding it toward Tim . " No , thanks . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after his cigarette was lit . " Pretty discouraging , after a day like this . I had my hopes all worked up . " " Is it ? " Tim asked . This man made him feel the way Mrs. Hale made him feel , too big for his clothes , and uncertain of his feet . " Well , I guess I 'd better be going , " he said . " I did n't even wear my sweater . " Mr. Blakeford never stopped looking at him , and now smiled a bit , meaning , " So I see , sonny , so I see , " but said , " Can we drop you off somewhere ? " " No , thanks . I have my bike . Well ... "   " Good night , " Mr. Blakeford said . " Well , good night . " It was that wet snow falling again . Mr. Blakeford 's car was standing at the curb with the parking lights on , a way nobody left a car in Reno , and its top and hood were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black past the street light on the corner , and turned white beneath it . Everything around the crossing looked unfamiliar and improbable , like a movie set for East Lynne . So nothing was settled after all . Everything in the hushed world was as vague as Marjory , as unreal as the house . It would all start over again tomorrow . The Economy of the Silver MillNEVERTHELESS , that night was the last time Tim ever saw Marjory . She did n't call him up , she did n't come back to school , and a week later Pauline Chester , watching his face curiously , told him that Marjory and her mother had gone to New York . A month later she showed him Marjory 's wedding announcement . This ending was like all the rest of the affair . Looking at the elegant , engraved writing upon the card , Tim was n't even sure that Marjory had married the man with the silver cigarette case , for he could n't remember the man 's name . The whole thing dimmed out in shadow . Marjory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light , with the vindictive joy in her face , and introduced the man with the silver cigarette case , and then she ran on up the stairs , her long skirt rustling , and disappeared into the shadows . The shadows lingered for a long time . Often they came back over Tim when he had not even thought of Marjory or the house . He would be sitting at the table in his room , writing , and because he looked up and saw a patch of late sunlight lying at an angle upon the wall in front of him , the life would fade out of whatever he was writing . He would lay his pencil down , and sit there staring at the patch of light , and P256all the labors of mankind through all time would appear to him like an attempt to carve a basalt cliff with a fingernail . He would feel just as he had when he sat on the couch in the front room of the old house , watching Marjory prowling and touching things with covetous affection or satirizing them with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sat there and suddenly , for a moment , the fog dissolved and he understood that the scene was real , and might go on forever . But even if it is not possible to say when , if ever , Tim was wholly freed of this interminable world , hopeful changes , which made the mood intermittent rather than constant , were soon noticeable . He began to get more sleep . When track started , he was no longer doing a mere stubborn job of running , as he had in the spring of his junior year , but often followed the , stallion , attained to the clarifying sensation of the nuclear . Music he heard and books he read came alive again in magical spells which sent him questing eagerly among the chords and images and ideas , and beyond them . His other lives revived as Rachel took up the feminine lead again , and he had four dates with the real Rachel , and although he failed in all of them , they did n't leave him in a sleep-walking misery , but lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the bottom of hell for days . They drove him out to walk and run again , in the hills and in the city . There was another change , too , in the realm of finance . To Tim , finance was represented by a bank he kept on the desk in his room . This bank had the shape of a mining mill , set upon a pyramid of tailings . It was all one color  --  silver gilt , except the roof of the topmost chamber , which was red . The tailings were silver also . There was a slot in the red roof big enough to slip a silver dollar through , and a door in the back which could be opened to take money out . What Tim had was what was in his pocket or in this mill . He liked silver dollars especially . He liked to hold a silver dollar . The rough circle of the edge felt good , and the weight was just right to be comforting in the hand , and it was pleasant to run the thumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the complex lives of a P257dollar as suggested by the little date on the face . 1873 , the dollar would say . The Civil War was over . In Virginia City the Comstock was booming , and the hill swarmed , and the famous chandelier was blazing in the Crystal Club . The dollar , brand new from the mint and unblackened , was sliding across the dark bar of the Crystal Club to a tall man with a brocaded vest.and patent-leather shoes . In that manner the history would begin . No other coin was as pleasing as a silver dollar . The date on a dime started nothing . A fifty-cent piece was n't heavy enough to feel good . Bills had no life at all . If Tim had more than two or three dollars in bills in the silver mill , he could never remember how much was there . He could never remember how much was there in change , either . But he always knew how many silver dollars there were . While he had been going with Marjory , there had never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not entirely because of Marjory . Tim had thrifty impulses , but there were too many other matters which were more important . He had bought a portable phonograph , and there was always some new record he had to have . He was always buying sheet music too , and tennis balls wore out fast and rackets broke easily , and sometimes he would even have to spend some money on clothes . He was miserly about this . He hated to spend money on clothes . It was wrong from all points of view . Old clothes felt much better , and were friendlier , and the matter was n't important enough to remember anyway . But after he began playing two or three times a week with the band , his father made him buy his own clothes . And then Willis was always borrowing from the bank too . That was all right . Willis never thought of returning it , but often he even told Tim he was going to take some , or that he had taken it , and Willis would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been able to keep any together . There was nothing tight about Willis . But it had been mostly because of Marjory that the mill stayed empty . Not that Marjory was a gold-digger . She was n't . She was a collector of reassurances . Sometimes the reassurances would take the form of toys , like the things in the box she had P258tried to give back to Tim . More often they would be little parties after Tim had not seen her for two or three days , or after he had played for a dance . She would want to go to supper downtown , anywhere . She would want to go to a show , any show . That these activities kept the silver mill empty was the fault of Tim 's own conscience . Marjory was willing to pay for them herself . When Tim was broke she did pay , often . But Tim could n't stand this . He always agreed with her that there was no reason why the girl should n't pay for anything they did together , but he would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make up to her for any party she paid for . He would have to take her out on a party which cost more than the one she had paid for , or bring her a present . Now this contest was over . Also , Willis had nearly given up borrowing from the silver mill . When he did borrow , he would usually take only enough to buy a magazine or to go to a show . Something was happening inside Willis , which made him so different in his habits t hat even Mr. Hazard , who had n't noticed the first- changes in his manner at all , wondered what was wrong with hint . He sat silently in the living room , looking at the carper and thinking about something , and when he could n't endure that any longer , he would get one of his magazines and read . The magazines he liked had fiercely painted covers showingmysterious figures with cloaks and masks , or very toughlookingmen with slouch hats and tommy guns , or beautiful women on the stocking-ad pattern , with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points , because of fierce , rat-inthe-cornerdefenses Against such men . Willis read the way he did everything else . I lc would start by lying down on his back on the couch , or on the bed up in his room . Then he would change his position every minute or two , sitting up , lying on his side on one elbow , lying on his belly , putting his feet up over the back of the couch , switching around and hanging his legs over the end of the couch . But anyway , there he was at home most of the time , and Tint knew that often , when he did go out , it was only to go across the street and sit in the shadow under the race-track fence and smoke a cigar . He had found Willis258P259doing that at two o'clock in the morning once . He had been coming home from a dance , and had seen the cigar glow and fade in the dark across the street . He had stood in front of the house for a minute , staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . Mrs. Hazard was really worried now . When Willis was sitting silently in the living room with them , she kept looking at him . She always hoped Willis would tell her something , but he did n't , and she never asked him . Not even Mr. Hazard asked Willis about his business any more . Mrs. Hazard would ask Tim sometimes , when neither Willis nor Mr. Hazard was there , but Tim did n't know any more than she did about what ailed Willis . All Tim knew about VVillis was that he was making very bad grades at school , which was nothingnew , and that it was only once in a long while , every two or three weeks , that he borrowed several dollars from the silver mill . It was probably this increase in wealth which first put the moss-agate into Tim 's mind . He saw it in a jewelry-store windowwhen he was downtown one afternoon , and he liked it . He did n't form an intention then . He was in no position to . But he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look on the gray dress with fur . After that , whenever he passed the jewelry-store window , he stopped to see if the moss-agate was still there . It always was , and he became very fond of it because of the dreams with which he surrounded it , and the vague hopes it began to represent . If anyone else stopped to look into the window while he was there , he would pretend to be looking at something more reasonable , like a tennis trophy or a pen-andpencilset , in order not to call attention to the moss-agate . The agate lay in an open case lined with gray satin . It was made up into a rectangular brooch , and the jeweler must have thought it was an unusual stone too , because it had been set in a delicate frame of platinum , like a true precious stone . It was a pale , translucent gray , and in some lights glowed from within , like an opal , though it never changed color , but only grew brighter . The brightness was like that which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early morning , and you expected , P266as you watched , that this mist would gradually dissolve and reveal a blue ocean stretching to a distant horizon . The illusion was reinforced by the singular bits of moss which were trapped ' in the agate . They appeared to be two tropical islands with palms upon them . One island extended into the agate from the left center , and the other , elliptical and much smaller , lay to the right of it , and just a hairsbreadth above , so that it seemed to be sunk much deeper into the agate , or rather to be many miles farther out on the sea . The distance between the two islands was increased by the palms . The moss on the end of the nearer island formed three distinct silhouettes , with narrow boles and arching fronds , lifted above a mass of lower growth , while on the outer island only a faint fuzziness was visible , which tricked the beholder into imagining a dense wall of palms because he had seen the first three . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air , water and distance are all conveyed by a single soft wash or by the color of the paper itself , because of the clever placement of a few human figures , or sails , or a perspectiveof serried promontories floating among clouds . The agate was scarcely larger than the thumb nail of a large man , and yet , if you looked at it intently , the rest of the display windowfaded away around it , and the scene in the agate expanded until the moment came when you were in it , perhaps in an outriggercanoe , paddling quietly toward the first island in the hushed expectancy of the morning . You knew also that other islands lay behind you , and that beyond the tiny one , which was the farthest you could see at the moment , were many more , scattered widely over the face of the serene waters . In short , you were afloat somewhere near the heart of the archipelago of the Secret Isles . Tim came to have an almost superstitious faith in the powers of this agate because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragic misunderstanding over something far more dignifiedthan talking too much , Rachel turned away from Tim and married a man so much older that no honorable vengeance was possible , and Tim , abandoning music , mankind and all but mere bodily life , sailed out on a tramp steamer from San Fran- P261cisco and , among the Secret Isles , dove overboard before daylightand disappeared from the world . Years later , Rachel , coming to the only populous island in the archipelago , stood at the rail of the steamer and recognized him in spite of his breech clout , long hair and blackened skin . She dared make no sign , because her husband , a monster whom she dreaded , stood behind her in a sun helmet , smoking a cigar . But at dusk , while the brute was getting drunk in the village with the trader , she came running down to the beach where Tim was loading his supplies . The years were erased in a brief agony of joy , and together , in the outrigger , they set forth toward an unencumberedlife of guitar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long surfs whitening in the dawn . That at least was the master plot from which innumerable variations stemmed , especially in the last part , which partook of the endless vistas of the St. Francis life . Such , then , was the well-nigh incomparable financial wizardryof Timothy Hazard in the spring before he was seventeen . CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN : About Such Lessons in Time as the Revival of the NeglectedFriends , the Victory of the Lost Tournament , the Immortal Flivver and the Incidentof the Misguided GeeseIT WAS a Friday in late May , warm and windless , the beginning of summer . The trees of Reno stood over the city in full and heavy leaf , and the year-book was out at school , which was a great relief to Tim and a great satisfaction to his conscientiousfriend , Fred Waters . Fred was the editor . " Hui , for no reason he could guess , was the business manager . He had no head for figures , and he loathed his chief occupation , which was soliciting advertisements from the business men and writing up  |p262in  printable form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FOR ALL THE KIDS and THE MODERN FUNERAL HOME , SERVICE WITH A PERSONAL TOUCH . Now that was all over , and the yearbookhad entered into its two or three days of real life . Commencementwas near , and everybody was disturbed by its approach . The seniors , especially , were filled with nostalgia , and a little frightened to discover that they had to savor four years in a few days . Everybody carried his year-book around in the halls and class rooms and had it signed by everybody else . Many of the seniors were trying to get all the other seniors to sign beside their pictures , to leave by their own hands small , scratchy tokens of their singular and inviolate beings . It was the great ceremony of the declaration of unification at last . There were still personal differences . Some were seekers and some were givers . Even these differences , however , were tacitly ignored . The meekest seekers , the rabbits and mice of the wilderness , the children of thin hopes and old people 's habits , managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ football heroes , student officers , dramatic stars and girls who always had dates . And if these notables felt that they were giving more than they received , nonetheless they made each earnest joke good with one no better , and wrote their names boldly in ways of great significance , nick-names instead of registered names , and often with additions , " For my friend , " or " Best of luck , " or " Happy days , " and sometimes even with the nick-name of the receiver also , " For I lank , " " For ' tiny . " Through the accumulation of several thousand such small acts of contrition , the ceremony of the year-book acquired the power of a revival . It is true that very few of these converts would even know where the holy books were a year later , and that within two years few but the lost would even care , but for three stirring days , at least , of which this Friday was the last , they were testaments to the overlooked . There is no knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That would afford a problem even more nebulous than an attempt to trace the influence of Shakespeare or Beethoven , but perhaps , just as an early and in- P263dicative instance , it had something to do with Tim 's great luck that very Friday . At noon he and Fred Waters walked back to school together . " We ought to celebrate , " Fred said . " Why do n't you get a date , and we 'll go out to Bowers tonight ? " " Swell , " Tim said . " I 'll let you know last period . " He spoke as if there were nothing to it , but he began at once to imagine an evening at Bowers with Rachel , and to fumble over the strategy of asking her . Rachel had n't signed his yearbookyet . He had put that off , watching for a time when nobody else was around . He would use the year-book as an excuse to start talking to her , and maybe he would find a way to ask her to go to Bowers . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , a little room at the end of the main corridor , and his luck began at once . Rachel was in the office by herself . She was a member of the year-book staff too , and it was a privilegeof the staff to select what they wanted from among the mounts and cuts and proofs that came back from the printer . Rachel was looking through a pile of mounts on the table . She made it very easy for him . She pretended fright and backed away from him , hugging a mount to her breast . " First come , first served , " she said . " Curses , " Tim said . " Which one is that , tightwad ? " With an air of being about to take wing , Rachel revealed the picture for an instant and embraced it again . It showed the two of them , side by side at the net , shaking hands with the coast team which had defeated them in the finals of the Western Tournament . Tim was sweetly wounded to find himself a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was also pierced anew by the knowledge that their time here was nearly gone , which was all the time that mattered , since Rachel was going away to college . Yet he mastered himself . " You can have the old thing , " he said . " I know a better one . " I lc began to work quickly down through the mounts and proofs on the table . Rachel began td go through them at the same time . They pushed at each other , and their hands touched among the cardboards . Sometimes , when she thought the nextP264picture was going to be the one , Rachel would grab for it with both hands , and try to get in front of him , so that she was practicallyin his arms . She was laughing all the time . " I know the one you mean , " she cried . " I 'll bet you do . " " I 'll bet I do . Anyway , I was here first , you big bully . " When they did come to the picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held it up in the air , so she could see it but could n't reach it . She jumped for it two or three times , and then stood there and made a face at him . " Boor , " she said . " Oaf . " It was a posed picture of the two of them in front of the school in their tennis clothes , and holding their rackets . It was a wonderful picture of Rachel , because it had caught the moment of quick laughter , and her eyes , looking right at you , were full of mischief and delight . She was hugging her racket with both arms . " I did n't want it anyway , " Rachel said . " It makes me look like a grinning monkey . " " O.K. , " Tim said , just for that you do n't get it . I was going to give it to you , but you ca n't call the girl I love a monkey . " It filled hint with blissful dread to find a serious joke like that coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft-soap me , " Rachel said . " You 're still a pig . " They looked through the rest of the mounts more quietly , choosing the ones they wanted and sometimes swapping finds . Rachel stood so near ' in ' that once in a while they still touched , though they were n't fooling now . He struggled to keep his breath and subdue the orchestral thunders that repeatedly beganin him . At last , and almost naturally , he said , " You have n't signed my year-book yet . " 1 lc insisted that she sign beside every one of her pictures , and was always finding another . He acted as if these discoveries were accidental , which was n't true . He knew every picture of her so well he could close his eyes and see them . He knew the numbers of the pages they were on . She declared that all this signing was not only foolish , but a deliberate im- P265position , and as a punishment made him sign all his pictures in her book . With great restraint , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he came to the posed tennis picture . Then his controlfailed , and he wrote also , " For my partner , " understanding tremendously that , as in the case of " good-bye " and " hello , " each of these words had a profound and particular meaning which might be barely suggested by some such definitions as : FOR : A word signifying the divine privilege of giving oneself entirely , excluding only undesirable traits such as talking too much . MY : A word often narrowly interpreted to denote the first person singular , possessive , but better conceived as connotingthe erasure of self in mutual desire . PARTNER : A word which , in spite of many mundane , and some practically criminal , uses , may also mean helpmate in bearing forever the marvelous and bewildering beauty of life . Synonyms : beloved , adored , heart 's desire , little soldierof the ultimate mountains , etc . Example : . " In this one moment , in this one life , in this small room with one windowthrough which may be seen the golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am about to ask My ( see definition ) PARTNER ( see synonyms ) for a date , if only I can speak her name . " He closed Rachel 's year-book quickly to prevent her seeing this bold inscription while he was present . His hands trembled . " You busy tonight , Rachel ? " he asked . " No , I 'm not , " Rachel answered . Even the tree at the windowwaited . " Would you like to go out to Bowers , maybe ? " And having said it , he was immediately inspired . " We could have supper , and then go swimming and dance and everything . i red and I ) oris are going too . " " I 'd love to , " Rachel said . " What do you want me to bring ? " " Not a thing , " Tim said grandly . " Fred and I have that all fixed . " This was n't really a lie , but just a premature truth . The first bell rang in the hall outside . Rachel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , watching Tim , who was hunting through the drawer of the table . He found the shears , and carefully cut his tennis mount in two . He gave her the half with his picture on it . " Conceited , " Rachel said , but she laughed , and she tucked the picture into her year-book . " When should I be ready ? " she asked . " We 'll be up about five , " Tim said . " About five , in old Tilly . " The first two classes in the afternoon went very slowly . Tim tried to pay attention . He was a good student this year , even on the honor roll . As a compromise he finally began to draw rapidly in his note book . He could listen some while he did that . In the first class it worked pretty well . He covered three pages with ballet dancers , Fred 's Ford with four little figures in it , prize-fighters , hurdlers , cowboys , jazz bands , crocodiles in hammocks and deck chairs , saints , mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , lions and opera singers , and bound each page into one design by means of very long dragons and serpents . In the second class , however , he began to draw an outrigger canoe on a lagoon , and it turned into a carefullyshaded drawing of himself and Rachel nearing the Secret Isles as the sun rose over the sea and the interminable future . He became immersed in the problem of drawing Rachel with her head turned away , so he would n't have to malign her face , and he never emerged . ' 1 ' he last class was physics lab , and time went faster there because he and Fred were working together , and first he had to tell Fred about his wonderful inspiration , and then they had to discuss everything they would get , and finally they had to work very attentively to finish their experiment in time . After school they ran all the way to Fred 's house , which was up beside the cemetery in the university quarter . Fred phoned his girl Doris Summers about the change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pickles , olives , oranges , bananas , bread , cake , four kinds of sandwich spread , potato chips , jam , P267jelly , lettuce , coffee , four huge steaks and a case of assorted root beer , ' ginger ale and lemon , cream and orange pop . They took all this up to Doris ' house , and she made a great many iokes about the orphans or the conventions they were going to feed , or how long they were going to live at Bowers , while she busily made the sandwiches and kept the boys wrapping them and packing things . She had already made a big bowlful of potato salad , and the last thing , she set the boys to cracking ice into a dishpan and setting some of the bottles in it . Then they started . Rachel laughed too , when she came out of her house and saw all the wealth piled on the floor in the back of filly . They all laughed . They were tickled anyway , by the thought of the four of them in Tilly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' house at five o'clock in the afternoon . The Wells ' house was huge and dark and covered with vines . It was n't on Court Street , but it was in that region , and the ancient and cobwebbysadness of Court Street brooded over the big lawns under the trees which made it like a park . The bright foothills showed between the trees , but they were far off , and appeared unreal , like a back-drop . Tilly did n't belong in such a place , and her air of upright assurance made her very funny . Tilly was an old Model T touring car with a brass radiator . Billy Wilson would have painted her with circus colors and written jokes on her , but Fred was n't like Billy Wilson . Tilly was dignified . Hers was the gentle and more enduring humor ) f an unconscious anachronism . She was painted a thick , shiny black , in which the brush strokes showed , her radiator was polished so that it shone like gold , and there were thin , yellow arrows painted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patched in many places , but was also painted a shiny black , and when Tilly attained her traveling gait , it flapped slowly and heavily , like a sail fallen off from the wind . There , was an old brass horn with a rubber bulb fastened to the side of her uprightwindshield . Fred drove Tilly in a rigid and elderly fashion , and with affection . He would always sound the horn just twice , bonk , bonk . As they came out of the shaded drivewayp268into the sun of the street , he slowed Tilly down until she shudderedand rattled , and squeezed the horn twice , bonk , bonk , and they all laughed . Tim and Rachel sat on the back seat . The seat was so high that even Rachel 's knees were on a level with the top of the door. " 1 feel like something in a goldfish bowl , " she whispered . A few moments later she whispered , " I ought to have on a poke-bonnet . " She considered . " No , " she whispered , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I guess , and black mitts without any fingers . " " A goldfish in a black bonnet and mitts , " Tim whispered , and Rachel laughed , squinting at him with the shining of secret joy in her eyes . The sun of the long afternoon was warm and golden across the valleys . The smell of cool water came out of the deepeningalfalfa and out of the meadows where young stock posed and stared fiercely , and suddenly ran off , cavorting and bucking , and stopped farther away to stare again . Tilly passed along evenly and noisily through the long shadows of trees into the shadows of near hills and out into sunlight again . Sometimes the four talked secretly , in two couples . Sometimes they talked back and forth very loudly . ' Filly 's top flapped slowly in the wind of her own motion , clop-clop-clop . There was something settled and gentle about Fred and Doris together . ' 1 ' hey were like people who have been very happilymarried for a long time . Theirs was one of the affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was an affair like Fred 's nature , which was outwardly slow and unmoved , but inwardly quickly moved by gentle or whimsical thoughts , or by long thoughts about the sweet and earnest intensity of life . The kindness of their love showed in Doris ' face too , when she turned around to speak to Tim and Rachel . She was excited by all this fun they were having , and by the magnificence of the preparations , and by the thought of everything that was going to happen . In this same warm and quiet way , Doris could be excited by all kinds of thoughts about living , even when she was just sitting alone on her own porch steps . P269The excitement showed only in her blue eyes , and in the tiny , tremulous movements of her lips before and after she smiled . The rest of her face was made beautiful by a tranquil light such as is sometimes seen on the faces of mature women to whose deepest yearnings life has made good answers . It was a pale face , and her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mostly to Rachel , when she turned around . She did n't know Rachel , because they went in different crowds at school , but she wanted Rachel to like her and Fred , and especially Tim , and she wanted Rachel to be happy too about their adventure in holy Tilly . Rachel understood . They expressed affection for each other in girls ' talk about other things . Rachel leaned way forward , so they would n't have to yell . There was no sign in her of the little soldier mounting guard . At last Tilly climbed slowly onto the final summit , and showed the Washoe Valley . There was a double feeling in the air here , as if spring were n't so far along . The mountains on the west were already in shadow , and a coolness came from the snow still banked among their heights , down onto the meadows , and brought with it a strong scent of pine . The two lakes were full and still and very blue , and the desert mountains in the east were warmly lighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of the mountain shadows . Rachel was looking out solemnly at the lakes . Her mood had changed . " Remember the wild geese ? " she asked Tim , and smiled at him , and watched him as if expecting something . That was an afternoon in the winter before Tim started goingwith Marjory , a cold , still afternoon , under a gray sky that promised snow . Ten of them came out in two cars , to skate on little Washoe Lake . They parked the cars in the sagebrush on the east side and sat on the frozen ground to put on their skates . They could look up , while they fastened their skates , and sec the winter willows by the inlet , and then the ghostly cottonwoodsspreading their branches over the last remnant of Washoe City , and then the base of the mountains whose peaks were hidden in the clouds . The ice on the lake was black and glassy , without a mark on it , so that each line cut by a skate hadP270the importance of a first word written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , to make his mark . Tim and Rachel had n't come together . Tim started out by himself to skate down the ditch onto Big Washoe , wanting to get out in the middle of the valley , in the middle of all the winter-quiet space . While he was climbing over one of the irrigationgates , he saw Rachel coming down the ditch behind him , and waited for her . They skated together out onto the miles of new , black ice . At first they were only going to go out far enough to get the feel of the space , but then it was so much fun skating along without ever seeing even their own marks , that they decided to skate clear across . Toward the middle of the lake they skated fast , because the ice felt thin and ran in a slow wave before them . Out in the very middle , east of them , they saw something on the ice , many little mounds scattered over a wide space . They made guesses , and then skated out to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with four wild swans among them . They decided to frighten the flock into the air . This was mean , in a way , but they both felt that it would be like performing a miracle of their own to start that multitude of strong , whistling wings rushing up through the gray air . They would leave right away then , and let the geese settle again . They came closer , skating fast all the time , and began to yell at the great birds , to startle them up . Many of the geese wailed and beat their wings , but only a few of them actually tried to rise , and they slithered and fell on the ice . Tim and Rachel started to laugh , because the geese looked grotesque , slipping and careening over like drunken old men , and then they stopped laughing at once , because the fear and helplessness of the geese were so plain to see and hear . The whole world became unfamiliarin a moment , and there was present all through it a bewilderingdissonance of the laughable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that for a moment they turned superstitious . It was really simple , though . The geese were n't enchanted or stupefied . They had landed on the ice , probably mistaking  |p271it  for water in the night , and they were unable to rise from it because their webs slithered on it and they could n't push off . That was all . Rachel and Tim tried to work them like sheep dogs working a flock , skating around them to drive them to shore where they could get footing . But the birds were so frightened , and cried out and hurt themselves so foolishly , that they had to abandon this driving . Also , the ice crackled under them when they skated so slowly , or paused , or turned short . Long lines of fracture radiated like forked lightning from their blades with each crackling . " They 'll settle down on their breasts and thaw through , " Tim said . So they skated swiftly on across to the beach on the edge of the flat meadows . Rachel 's feet were numb , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fire was bright and almost red against the snow . Rachel sat down near the fire , and Tim unlacedher skates and drew them off , and drew off her heavy socks and laid them across stones near the fire . Rachel 's feet were small and icy in his hands . He chafed them gently with snow before she held them to the fire . They sat there then , wondering to each other about the geese , and other things the geese made them think of . What was the mysterious mentor in birds that guided and timed their migrations ? Why was that mentor occasionally so wrong , as in t he case of these geese ? It was a short talk because of the cold and the late hour , but it began long thoughts about space and stars and mortal insignificance . Those were tremendous thoughts to share on the edge of the frozen lake in the empty valley , with only snowy mountains in sight and the dusk coming on . It ' was dark already when they found their way back onto Little Washoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bank , and the far-away sound of laughing , and the smell of coffee . That was a fine time to remember ; nothing at all wrong with it . " Yes , I remember , " Tim said to Rachel . They told Doris and Fred about the geese , and because of this all four of them were quiet and full of big thoughts when P272they came to the tall , stately poplars which defended Bowers ' Mansion from the valley . The History of MankindAccording to the Poplars of Bowers ' MansionTHE gray face of the mansion stared out at the valley through the gap where the driveway entered . The stone fountain on the front lawn was lifted before it like an admonitory finger . " Go quietly , go quietly . We remember a good deal here , and we learned a good deal , though too late . Nobody is of much impor- .. , tance anywhere at any time . Just remember that , and we 'll get along . " Tilly passed sedately between the gray face and the finger and entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the four doors . Doris stood holding her door open and looked up , and the others looked up . Everybody looked up when he first entered the grove . It was inevitable because the poplars were venerable and lofty , and all their branches reached upward , closing over one another toward the sky . The shadow of the mountain lay over the shadow of the poplars in the grove . Only a few of the loftiest spires reached into the sunlight and leaned resignedly to movements of the air which could not be felt below . This was the sacred grove of a faith which was no longer even an effective mythology . Yet the great " Why ? " always at the center of the little " whits " and " howl " that make religions into mythologies is often stronger in dead temples than in living . Mortality gives the ' Vhy its power , and mortality is undeniablein the sacred grove of Bowers ' Mansion . Tim thought of Sandy Bowers and Filly Orrum as he and Fred started a fire in the old stove against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out onto the open slope . Only Sandy and Eilly of all the mansion 's ghosts remained individually present . The in-272P273numerable mocking roisterers from Virginia City , Gold Hill , Silver City , Johnstown , Carson , Washoe , who had fed upon Eilly 's vanity and Sandy 's blind generosity , came and went like autumn leaves before each breath of the imagination , but it seemed to him that Eilly and Sandy were still presences in the mansion , presences which withdrew before the intruder , but always left some disturbing essence of themselves to make him uneasy . At this hour , when the shadows came , the picnic grove was also theirs , though they could never come out on the other side , to the swimming pools and the dance platform . Here , upon the dusty paths , in the quiet gloom , Eilly paraded slowly and haughtily , taking the air of the past , and poor Sandy crept behind her . Most often , when Tim imagined them in the house , he saw them posed like an old photograph , Sandy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seated before the east window of an upstairs room , sometimes coughing slowly and weakly , staring out at the valley and dreading the moment when he must go downstairs and play host to guests he now knew for what they were ; Eilly standing behind him , one hand upon his shoulder , holding him , not because she wanted him , but because he was her property , seeing herself at last as the jest of Europe and the butt of the silver camps . Those were their everlasting moments . Tim thought of these things only in fragments , but the big Why was constantly present in the grove , only the more so when he and Fred spoke with mortal voices while they made the coffee and cooked the steaks , or when he heard the girls laughing softly together , speaking in their light voices , making little sounds of glass and silver as they set the table and spooned out the salad . Three small children from another supper party at the other end of the grove played tag among the trees , makinglittle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , calling out where they were hidden , squealing when they were caught . They alone seemed oblivious of the shadow , quick as birds in a world without a past or a future , and their sounds disturbed the quiet no more than bird notes . When the four sat down to their feast , Tim and Rachel on P274one side , Doris and Fred on the other , Tim felt the great Why of the grove very strongly . It made Rachel 's small , white face , laughing beside him , appear terribly important , desirable and temporary , against a background of many dark tragedies from which he could n't protect her . This life of a moment , as if he could foresee their sufferings and their lonely deaths too near behind them , was also in the faces across the table . It made him sad , and at the same time very happy that he was there , looking upon these three , hearing the words they spoke . The sunlight slowly left the last spires of the poplars . Little winds before night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper napkins on the table . The four of them , sitting there and drinkingtheir coffee and laughing softly together , were snatching something of inestimable worth from under the nose of time . He kept this secret to himself . Doris got up , saying , " I 'll have to take a walk before I dare go swimming . " There was a great deal left to be taken home , or eaten later , if they were hungry again . " I'hcy stored it away in Tilly , puttingthe dishpanful of ice and pop bottles on top because they would be more likely to want that than anything else . Then Doris and Fred walked away among the trees toward the mansion. ' lint and Rachel went in the other direction , climbing up the bank into the wild grass , and taking the narrow path toward the base of the mountain . The trees were pines out there , and far apart . Passing them was like passing people to whom you should pay some attention . The poplars in the grove made a wall , protecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they could not live . Out here the valley was open . Tim and Rachel found a big boulder on the side of the mountain , and sat on it and looked at the valley . The lakes were in the shadow now . There was still sunlight among the mountains in the east , and above them and above the shadow of the Sierra , it streamed across the sky . Coming up here from the grove was almost like coming outdoors . They talked quietly , with long pauses , about Rachel going away to college , and about what Tim wanted to do with his music . When the light went off the P275last mountains , they walked back down the path , and th ough the grove , and around the mansion to the swimming p ools . They walked slowly and dreamily . They stood by the d-eper pool and looked dreamily at the water . Already the bats were hunting in and out among the poplars and over the pool . Fred and Doris came out of the dressing rooms with their bathing suits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they came out of the dressing rooms , there was darkness in the alley and blue gloaming in the sky . The little lights on lines mound the pools and the dance platform went on while they were looking , and made the sky as dark as the valley . The nig It air moved under the lights , and played with their half-t aked bodies . Rachel looked even smaller and more perfect and more separate in her bathing suit than in her clothes . Tim was t ewly filled by a great rush of sad adoration , the beginning of songs and legends about her . She saw him looking at her , and made t he quick smile , but wistfully . It was all working in he too . They walked slowly and silently , side by side , to the edge of the deeper pool . Rachel put on her cap there , stood poised for an instant with her arms back , and dove in . Tim watched her feet disappear under the little cloud of bubbles which rose and glittered in the light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swimming was also dreamy . There were other people in the water , and Tim stayed near Rachel , but felt as if he were kept from going to her . He would float on his back , at racked by this grief of separation , and think brief , disconnectedthoughts about the bats that dipped quickly into the light , onto the water , and then fled softly up into the dark again , and about the stars he could see in the east between the treetops , and about Rachel , whose wonder not his heart or his mind could define or withstand . When several thoughts about her had passed through him , he would feel a little fear , bet% a great deal of time must have passed , and he did n't know where he was . He would roll over and look for her white cap , and see it fifteen or twenty feet away , at the other end of the world , perhaps even with the heads of strangers between . l le would swim softly toward it . When he came close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sometimes make the fireworks in his heart by gently splashing a little water in his direction . Once , when he rolled over and looked , he could n't find her anywhere on the water . He was filled with despair and the emptiness of loss . Then he saw her . She was standing by a tree between the two pools , and looking up intently toward the sky , probably trying to see the stars over the electric lights . His love shot up with joy , and celebrated her . Later the four of them played tag in and around the pool . They were all good swimmers and divers . They pursued each other across the dark water , through the splintering of the little lights on the ripples , and clambered out dripping , and raced around the edge , and dove back in again . They laughed in fine water battles , and competed to see who could slip into the water most quietly from a jack-knife dive . Tim and Rachel had a race across the pool and back . Rachel was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly and evenly , only her flutteringfeet making a swift , whispering churning . Tim beat her only because of his reach and strength . They did n't notice that the orchestra was tuning up on the platform until there were only the four of them left in the pool. " ' ' hen it was so big and free to have the water to themselves , that they began another game of tag . After that they swam together in a kind of water dance to the music the band was playing . This was deeper fun . There was something which searched them and then made them happy , in gliding along , four in a row , all right arms gleaming slowly up together , and then all left . They swam in circles , one behind the other . Then they swam in a kind of square dance in couples , back and forth , splitting couplesas they met and swinging wide on the turns . Then they lay on their backs in a four-pointed star , with their feet together in the center , and revolved slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned over and swam back until their heads were together . Doris was the slowest swimmer , so they let her set the pace where it was easy for her and she could keep it up , and when they wheeled in line , she was the pivot . It was Doris , while they were pulling the star apart , who P277first saw the moon rising , and called in a hushed voice , " Oh , look , " and stopped swimming and stood there looking . They all swam over to the cast side of the pool , and hung with their chins over the edge , and watched the moon . The moon was huge and white , and its ascent was so tremendous an event that the silence and ease with which it happened made them remember how far away the moon was , although it appeared to be just above the mountains across the valley . " It looks so close , but it is n't , " Rachel said . Then they all felt that the world was rolling over to expose the moon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they were suddenly aware of the incredible speed with which the world was spinning and at the same time swinging bodily through emptiness . With their fingers on the edge of the pool , they clung to a flying world and felt confusedly the beauty and unhappiness of mortality . Then , between the spires of two poplars , the moon rose high enough to light the valley , and the gleam came across Big Washoe , and this near beauty was more bearable . Tim turned his head and looked at Rachel 's face . The moonlight was stronger on it now than the glow of the electric lights , which had become pitifully small and yellow . " Let 's get dressed and dance , " he whispered . They danced slowly , and without talking . The moonlight came in among the poplars and lay in patterns with the shadows . The number of the poplars was multiplied by their own shadows . The band played two waltzes to every other kind of number , and whenever they played a waltz , the little lights around the platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights on the music racks . The faces of the . players were hale and isolated above these lights , and the dancers moved slowly and steadily around the floor in the darkness and di roughc gently stirring patches and beams of moonlight . ' I'he band played Moonlight and Roses again and again , and when they did n't play it for three or four numbers , sonic of the dancers would ask for it . They did n't want the fast , jazzy numbers . When the lights went up , and the band began a loud , fast num- P278ber , only a few couples stayed on the floor . More of them sat down on the benches around the edge of the platform , and some left the platform entirely and wandered about in the shadows in the grove . They came back when the lights went off , and the band began to play Moonlight and Roses again . Always the same thin , dark boy , with a high tenor , stood up in the band and sang the refrain . Moonlight and rosesBring wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true -- Many of the dancers sang with him , softly , or hummed the melody . Their voices made a murmuring undertone , above which the voice of the singing boy flew slowly , by itself , like a gull above the sea of their murmuring , like the moon above their darkness . I Lis voice was n't really good , but thin and shallow , like a falsetto , and also the playing of the band was thin and methodical . Nevertheless , small among the feet of the poplars , lost in the vast night under the moon , carried upon the soft singing of the dancers and the hushed scraping of their feet , this music had a plaintive beauty . Tim even felt that it was good to have all the other dancers there . They were all the rest of the human world , and to be loved because they could all be together , quietly and happily , and yet each couple alone . They must all be in love too , he thought . They were the dark history of the race , moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck by moonlight , and sometimes shivered in it , not as if the air stirred , but as if the air were perfectly still and the trees themselvesshivered because of the moonlight and the things they were remembering in the moonlight . Here and there on the platform , a single face would pass into the moonlight and be clear and wistful for an instant and then turn slowly away or fade back into the shadow . It was theseP279little passages which made the dark history true . True history was the incalculable sum of single faces showing whitely for an instant and then gone . True history was not to be told by events or by nations , or by the names of kings and presidents and dictators . This moon hung also over the desert , softly leveling the dreamy hills into the dreamy valleys and raising up the peaks of the great ranges in their snow , the peaks of the Sierras , the Wassuks , the Shoshones , of the Toyabcs and the Toquimas , of the Monitors , White Pines , Rubies and Rockies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the peaks which in snow and in the moonlight were brothers of the moon . All humanity like one frightened , migratory tribe , filed in a thin dark line across this empty land , bending up into the passes and down into the valleys , into the faint mist of the moonlight over the lakes in the valleys , where they knelt and drank , and turned up their faces to the moon , and then went on , and were gone . How long the great ranges had lain under the moon before the line began to cross them ; how long and little changed they would lie there yet , riding vastly eastward in the night , after the line had passed , and the sun had dimmed , and the earth becomea huge , faint moon , and time itself had grown old in the everlasting . This vision , like a symphony in Tim 's mind , brought on a fierce access of love for Rachel , of yearning for her inestimable worth and courage and her tiny bit of time . Since her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his , and he held her in his arm , this yearning became joyous , and was a moment of successful prayer . In such space , in such multitude , in such unimaginabletime , the whole meaning of life for him was never to be where he could n't touch Rachel . He must always be able to touch her among mountains and moons and time . Out of the dark , strong , minor symphony of mankind , cried out suddenly , clear , high and resounding , the trumpets of the adoration of Rachel . He was very careful , in order not to startle her , but he drew her closer and closed his hand a little upon hers . Rachel moved her head , but not away from him . Perhaps she too was hearingP280history according to the moon in the poplars of Bowers ' Mansion . They danced slowly into a beam of moonlight , and turned slowly in it , and Tim , bending his head , being the tender sentry to guard her from the universe , saw her face against his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear the orchestra again , gently and automaticallythumping and crooning Moonlight and Roses . As they danced along the side of the platform in the darkness , he saw an area of the bare face of the mansion through the trees , bold in the moonlight . He thought of the dark window in it , and of Sandy Bowers sitting in the window , and Eilly standing behind him , like a photograph in an old family album . He chuckled softly . Comedy was such sad stuff . Rachel 's head moved against his sweater . " What are you laughing at ? " she asked . " I was just thinking that probably Sandy and Eilly are sitting up in the window now and listening to Moonlight and Roses . I was just wondering if they got on any better together on a night like this . " After a moment , Rachel said , " Oh . " Then she asked , " Do n't they get on together by now ? " " I do n't know , " ' lint said , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants so much , and old Sandy does n't want anything , or if he does , he does n't know what it is . " Rachel said , " ( ) h , " again . It was a soft oh , as if she were happy . Tim was very happy about the way she said oh . Moonlight and Roses ended , and the lights went on around the platform . Tim did n't want to let go of Rachel , but he had to in that light . The ( lancers were moving around , making little groups and talking , sitting down by couples on the benches , going down by couples into the grove , but even in the light the spell was n't broken . Tim could see by their faces that all of them were still feeling the spell . As they passed him , going down into the grove , many of them were still humming the tune softly . He saw Doris and Fred going away together among the poplars , toward the back of the mansion . They were holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hide this weakness from anyone coming behind them . " Maybe they wo n't even haunt tonight , " Rachel said . " What ? " " Eilly and Sandy . Maybe they 'll get some rest . " The band began to play Brown Eyes , Why Are You Blue ? rapidly and jerkily . " No rest , " Tim said , grinning . " No rest , " Rachel said , smiling quickly . It was wonderful how much they understood because of Filly and Sandy . Rachel smiled as if she were happy and feeling gentle . Tim was very happy about the way Rachel smiled . " Let 's take a walk around , till they get done with that thing , " he said . " Let 's , " Rachel said . They strolled between the trees toward the front of the mansion , because Fred and Doris had gone toward the back . Tim thought of holding her hand , or taking her arm . He even t Iiought of putting his arm around her . But he did n't touch her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along beside him , and t he trumpets of the human symphony blew high and clear and challenging within him . Every thought about her , or impulse toward her made him strong , daring and joyous . He believed he , could do anything she wanted him to do , anything . If he could pity the human race , and not lose hope , if he could return from among the stars and the terror of their time , and find that he loved her more than ever , then that was a great love . That was the kind of love that could do anything . They came out in front of the mansion , where the treesopened to the road and the valley , and hesitatingly stopped ; liking because the night felt so different here . The fountain , ' caught between the moon and the lights of the mansion , madeconfused shadows , which passed through one another upon thecircular lawn . The night was open over them , and t he moon wasrising on it , and the greatest stars . The open hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moonlit:c of the mansion , but the upstairs windows and the four dor-P282mer windows in the roof were closed and dark , and reflected the moon . In the white light inside the white living room there was a silent scene taking place . On the corner of the table sat a beautiful young woman , with her long legs crossed and swinging . I Icr face was white , clear-featured and austere . Her black hair was parted in the middle and drawn back into a knot . She was seen in the interval between two young men standing with their backs to the window . A third young man , in profile , completed the semicircle before her . The young man in the middle was performing slow endearments to the long legs . The beautiful young woman did not appear to be aware of these endearments . With detached and haughty mien , she was raising a glass to her mouth . She was raising the glass carefully , but also lifting her head away from it . The young man in profile held his hands out toward her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His lips moved hurriedly , and his face was pale and sharp with eagerness . The young man who was begging of the shapely legs , ceased moving , and stood with his hands folded upon the young womn 's knee , and appeared to listen attentively . The third man , who had not moved until now , turned his head and watched the man in profile . His face was heavy and red , with thick , black eyebrows . It was also puzzled and sullen . I lc disliked the eloquence of the young man in profile , or else he could not understand it . The beautiful young woman held the drink in the air before her , and slowly turned her head , and stared at the eloquent young man , and said something brief and decisive . Her lips moved with precision as she spoke , and closed firmly when she was done . Nothing that was said could be heard , because of the band in the grove , which was still playingBrown Eyes , Why Are You Blue ? loudly and jerkily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framed by the window . Its background was a white plaster wall upon which appeared , with an effect of ridiculous formality , a closed dour in the center , and upon one side a dark oil painting of Lilly Orrum , and upon the other a dark oil painting of Sandy Bowers . To the two children standing in the driveway , staring at it , P283this scene made a great and confusing change in the meaning of the night . They both looked away from the scene , and away from each other . " Shall we go in where the piano is ? " Tim asked . Rachel did n't answer , but began to walk forward by herself , and to climb the stone steps . Tim followed her . He felt that he was now pleading with her for something , though he did n't know what . They entered the hall . The door of the room in which the beautiful and austerely drunken young woman was perhaps holding at bay her three lovers , was closed , but now the voices were audible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice . Before he had finished , the woman began to laugh shrilly . While she was still laughing , two of the men began to speak at the same time . They sounded angry . The laughter continued , but it became broken and gasping , and was made up of giggles and little shrieking spasms , as if one of the men were playing with her in a way which tickled . The little , shrieking spasms became words . The beautiful young woman was crying out repeatedly , " Harry , stop it . Stop it , Harry . Harry , if somebody comes in . " Rachel went into the other front room , and Tim followed her . The room was not large , but it had a high ceiling , and was empty , and it echoed . The floor was bare and bright and waxed for dancing . The only object in the room was an automatic piano in one corner . The piano had a front of opaque , green glass , set in wooden arches , so that it looked like a church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abruptness , but after a moment the voices went on arguing . Rachel stood in the middle of the room . She was the little soldier . She looked slowly about the room , and up at the ceiling . Everything was going wrong . " Want to play something ? " Tim asked . " All right , " Rachel said . He put a nickel into the piano , and it grumbled to itself andhen began to play . It was out of tune , and tinny , and soundedloud in the empty room . It immediately took possessionP284of the empty room . The keys jumped sharply , by themselves , all up and down the keyboard . Rachel stood in the middle of the room and stared at the jumping keys . She was getting fartherand farther away . When Tim came toward her to dance , to see if he could hold her , she continued to stare dreamily past him at the jumping keys , while she slowly raised her right hand for him to take . She moved stiffly and mechanically in his arms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing in the room at all but the two of them dancing stiffly and slowly around the outside of the floor , and the piano hammering away , yet the room felt crowded with embarrassing presences . When they passed the north window , which was also open , the band , playing another tune in another rhythm , contested with the piano . Tim thought that if someone else , newly come from the grove into the open moonlight , were to stop out front and look at the mansion , he and Rachel , dancing slowly , like courteous enemies , in the bright and empty room , would make a pantomimeto balance the one in the other room . " Holy cow , what a noise , " he said , making a face . " Let 's not dance , " Rachel said quickly , and at once stopped and took her hand away from him , and went out of the room with rapid , nervous steps . He followed her . The door across the hall was still closed , but with the piano playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the hall to the court in back , and waited for him there . It was better in the court , in the soft light , laced with shadows , and with the mountain going up , steep and near , into the moonlight , but still they could hear the ruthless piano playing by itself , far away in the house , with nobodythere to ( lance . Tim had to do something to change what was happening . He had to do something right away , because he was losing her , and felt as if he might start talking to keep her . He wanted to explain to her that what had just happened did n't mean a thing , and then to prove to her that it did n't mean a thing , by telling her all he had thought about the history of mankind and about the time when the world itself would finally be a moon , and how , after all this wandering through the universe , what hadP285really happened was that he loved her even more than he ever had before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because he did n't know what had happened to them . Nothing had happened , really . He had n't said anything or done anything . And he knew he could n't tell her how he loved her . The first terriblewords were already filling his mouth : " Do you remember that four-forty in the Western meet this spring ? " The door of the old bar-room in the north wing was standing open . A warm , orange light came out of it , and made a long , distorted rectangle upon the flagstones of the court . " How about a root beer , or something ? " he asked loudly . Rachel nodded more emphatically than a root beer was worth . They went into the bar-room . An old man was asleep in a round-backed chair beside a small round table with a marble top . He was slumped over , with his chin on his chest . A white cat with a black patch on one side of its face was curled on his knees . The cat watched them enigmatically out of wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and wearing a white , starched acket , stood behind the bar and watched them too . He was no lore curious than the cat . He did n't say a thing when Tim shed for two root beers , but just poured them , and put a lot f cracked ice into them , and pushed them across . Tim andachel stood there and drank their root beers through strawsd sucked the ice . They did n't try to talk , because it was solet in the bar-room . The mechanical piano must have stoppedaying by now , but if it had n't , they could n't hear it . All theyuld hear was the old man in the chair , breathing slowlyrough his mouth , as if sighing , and very distantly , because theinflows were closed , the band in the grove playing Lover , mule Back to Me . The bar-room was old . It seemed older thanwhite rooms in the house . More of what had happened inre had soaked into the dark walls . There were no ghosts inre tonight , though , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bar-room. hen they went out into the court again , Rachel stopped laughed .   " What 's the matter ? " Tim asked . He was experiencing the interior fireworks because she had laughed . " Do you know what we 've done ? " she asked , giggling . " No , what ? " " We 've just bought two root beers , " she said , " and there 's still five or six bottles of root beer in Tilly . " This was very funny , and he could n't understand what he had been so worried about , a few minutes before . They had seen some drunks making fools of themselves in a kind of queer combination , and the mechanical piano had sounded terrible . That was all . They walked slowly around toward the dance floor . When they came up onto the platform , the dark boy who sang Moonlightand Roses was waiting for them . He took hold of Tim 's elbow . " How goes it , Tim ? " he asked . " ' Lo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't , but I 'm going to , right now . Monty wants to know will you take a fiddle solo on the next number . " Tim felt shy about these dreamy dancers . This was n't his band . I lc became awkward and reluctant . Also , he didn't. want to leave Rachel , not even for a minute , not even with Paul , who was all right . " I do n't ... " " Monty has a fiddle here . He says everybody 's softened up fine , and with a fiddle solo now , he can make ' em swoon . He wants you to swoon ' cm . " " Well , I ... " " On Moonlight and Roses . If you 'd never heard it before tonight , you 'd know it now , would n't you ? " " Sure , " Tim said , " but . . . " He looked at Rachel . " Go ahead , Tim , " she said , laughing quickly . " Make us swoon . " " I 'll see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul said . " She can swoon on me . " Well . . . " Tim said , and looked at Rachel , and then lent over to where the band was waiting . P287The violin was on a chair beside the piano . Monty was sitting at the piano . He was a thin man with a white face , a patentleatherhair comb and spectacles . They said . hello , and Tim opened the case and took out the bow and tightened it and put the resin on . Then he took out the violin , and pinched it under his chin . Monty gave him the A , and he tuned to it with open string chords and short runs to get the intervals . The violin had the little differences from his own which made it feel strange in his hand . The throat was bigger and the bridge was higher and more steeply arched , so that the fingering was harder than on his own , and he had to roll the bow more than he liked . The whole violin was heavier , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't build up the sounds from the strings . Tim stood out of the light , with the violin tilted down , and played soft runs in different keys until he had the intervals . Then he held the violin up and did a couple of bars from Avalon Town , and finallyswept down his beloved strings an air from the first movement of the Pathetique . He had a superstition that you could tell what kind of soul a violin had by playing that air on it . This violin had a heart after all , and a mouth . It could sing . It still felt stiff , as if the melody came off the strings only , but it did n't . It came out of the inside of the violin , a sweet , mournful sweep that had depth . He fingered rapidly through Moonlight and Roses . Monty put him out front , with the lights behind him , and the band began to thump and croon Moonlight and Roses . The dancers were n't in the dark now ; they were in the moonlight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the length of the poplars . Tim was nervous about playing , and he did n't like this . He liked to feel anonymous and impersonal when he played , just part of his instrument and part of the music made by all the instruments . Here he was a stranger to the instrument and to the band . Rachel was part of it too , probably . I lc was listening for the refrain , but he kept looking for Rachel dancing with Paul , and thinking that he was playing for Rachel , as if t his were a command performance , and he had a lot staked on it . He raised the violin . The band did n't lead him in at all , but P288thumped right on into the refrain . He took almost a quarter beat delay , and then went through the refrain that way , just a little behind the band , so that it seemed he was playing more slowly and fully than the band . He was n't with the violin yet , though . Ile was just playing on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to draw the tempo out a little , and to go more softly , and build him up . The second time through , he played the whole song , and when they reached the refrain , he and the violin were together . Then he forgot everything else , and played . He was joyous , and wanted to play tricks with chords and runs and high climbing , but he held all that to the line , and let it come out in making the strings sing sweetly and strongly in the vocal range , swelling on the rising phrases , taking the refrainaway from the introduction , the way it should be . Ile was n't even thinking about Rachel now . He was n't thinking about anything , but bursting with the hope that he could make the violin strong and soft and sad-happy enough to belong out there under the sky and down there among the poplars as in a deep well of moonlight and leaves . He felt everybody listening and dancing and loving , but they were all one , and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he and they were all part of the same great thing without a name that the leaves and the moon were part of too . The third time through , he was right all the way . There was real applause . Dancers called out to have it again . Monty turned around and looked at Tim , and Tim nodded . Ho was happy with the violin now . He could go on playing all night , only not Moonlight and Roses . He wanted to improvise . He wanted to compose on the violin , with some kind of a magicalorchestra to keep up the background for him . He wanted to tell everybody , with the violin , how wonderful the night was , and how it was to be in love , and what he thought about the moon and the leaves . He was full of ideas for weaving all around the first part of Moonlight and Roses , which was dead , and just waiting . Instead , he let that part go by again , and then let himself softly and tremulously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roses for a third dance , P289even . When Tim went back to put the violin away , Monty looked at him curiously , but only said , " Good going , kid . ' hanks . " " Any time , " Tim said . " It 's a swell fiddle . " He wrapped the violin carefully in its silk cloth , and put it to sleep , thinking about Rachel again . That was his secret he would have to keep from Rachel , that when he and the violin were together , he was n't thinking about her , but about everythingat once , and wanting only to say it all with the violin . It was funny he had n't thought of it before , but it was really that way whenever he played what he wanted to , or was going well with a band that was going well , or was writing a song or a poem that moved him . They would nearly all begin with Rachel . In his mind he would be playing or writing for Rachel , but when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or perhaps even for nobody . That happened even to the songs about the Secret Isles . He would still see Rachel , but she would c everybody , all the girls in the world in love and full of wonder , and he would be there in the story too , singing the song , but he would be all boys amazed by the beauty of their girls nd by the fierce and wonderful mysteries of the universe. mehow , this secret from Rachel made him happy . He wasorth more when he went back to her . It was again only Rachel he wanted , though , when he went out looking for her and Paul . He found them by the stairs , here Paul had stopped him . " O.K. , boy , " Paul said . " You are the star . It 's a good thing r you , you got back , though , " he said , looking at Rachel and grinning . " You were breaking my heart . I was falling in love th somebody , and who was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , she said , " It was swell , Tim . It madewhole band sound different . I do n't know . It got every- , They stayed there dancing until the band was done . The wd was smaller toward the last , and many faces had the d-dreamy kind of look , but they were happy , and they all P290sang Home , Sweet Home quietly together when the band played it . The lights went off over the pools . They were off in the mansiontoo , and the moonlight was on the roof , but the face was in shadow . Tim wanted to be very quiet , and treasure tenderly everything he had . They walked slowly together to the picnic grove , and this time he did take Rachel 's arm , and then , with her arm inside his that way , even took her hand and laced their fingers together . She did n't seem to mind . Only a little moonlight penetrated the picnic grove . The great shadows were everywhere . Tilly was in a shadow . They found Fred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ginger ale . They squeezed over , and all four of them sat on the running board , and Tim and Rachel had root beers . They were all quiet and happy and not sleepy . They did n't want to go home . They went home very slowly , even for Tilly , so slowly that the top did n't go clop-clop , but only flipped gently once in a while . The moonlight was all over the land , and the mountains were soft and dreamy in it , and seemed to have tender , personal memories . But their dreaminess was n't sleepy . It did n't seem to Tim that anything could be sleepy that night . The animals in the fields were n't asleep . They stood at the fences and watched Tilly go by , and their eyes gleamed in the moonlight , and in Tilly 's headlights . Fred had one arm around Doris , and only the pale crown of Doris ' head showed over his shoulder . They spoke to each other seldom and in whispers . For a long time Tim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tentatively about Rachel 's shoulders . It was a moment of suspense . The splendor of the night was at stake . Rachel moved closer to him , and laid her head in his shoulder . The moonlight was dazzling . The motor of Tilly was a symphony . In the silence and awe of the night , millions of small , lovely , winged creatures fled softly about in the air in ecstasy . They circled the mountains in worship . With great crescendos of affection , they swooped down over the heavenly fields . With tiny cries of desire , they soared at the moon . They were the P291many million parts of the bliss of Tim Hazard , which he could n't contain . When Tilly turned upon a hill so that the moonlight came in , and he could see clearly how Rachel 's hands lay together in peace in her lap , he wanted to weep for happiness . He did n't dare to move . He did n't dare to speak . Rachel lay so still against him , that finally he was afraid she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protective than ever , but also strangely unhappy and lost . All the motion in the night stopped when he thought that Rachel might have fallen asleep . He had to know . " Asleep ? " he whispered . She shook her head a little against him . In the night the silent and glittering flight was resumed . " Tired ? " he whispered . She shook her head again . That was all they said on the way home , and then Rachel said ) od night.twice . She said it once as they stood outside the door , d then , when the door was almost closed , she opened it part ay and said good night again , very gently . Oh , My Brother , My BrotherI M asked Fred to let him off downtown , and when Tilly as a block away , he stopped idling along the sidewalk and any ran to the jewelry-store window . He was afraid , now at he saw what he had meant all along to do with the mossate , that it would be gone . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window , and he could n't see the agate very well by r street light , but it was there . He did n't have to see it . He knew the world of the moss-agate better than he knew the bite house by the race track . He would come down and get the next day . On the way home he became very busy testing out different ens for presenting the moss-agate to Rachel . It must n't look P292like trying to give her an engagement ring or a frat pin or anything like that , but maybe , after tonight , it could be a little more than a going-away present , a kind of till-you-come-back present . He finally got the party all planned . The family car was in the garage with serious trouble . All the better , then ; he 'd rent a drive-yourself car , not one of the old , rattly , taxi-cab sort , but a fine one , a big Packard or Cadillac sedan . They would drive out to dinner at one of the clubs on the river , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good one , and then go to one of the clubs downtown and dance . He had friends in most of the bands now , who could get him in . When he had all these details set- tied , he tried to foresee the conversation which would lead upto giving Rachel the agate , but here the planning failed . Ile could n't decide which place would be the best , and he could n't imagine with any confidence what Rachel would say when he said something . That would just have to wait till the time came . He only hoped Rachel would wear the gray dress . That would give him an easy lead . It would take a lot of money for such aparty , though . There would be a big deposit on the car he wanted . He 'd count the money in the silver mill when he got home . If only it could he very soon , even tomorrow night , while there was still this moon , while they both remembered whateverit was that had made Rachel say good night twice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hint enough to make his heart beat wildly whenever he thought of it . When he reached the house , he stood on the porch , looking at the moonlight on everything , until he had brought this future safely to the point of the interminable vista . Then he went in and tiptoed up to his room . He turned on the reading light above his table , and carried the silver mill over to the table from the dresser , but then delayed the counting because Rachel 's graduation picture , in the gray dress , with her name signed across the corner , stood on the desk . He sat looking at the picture , and entered into the near reaches of the interminable vista , He was seated beside her in the moonlight on a great rock , and the south sea lapped softly around them .   " Hiya , fella , " Willis ' voice said behind him . He sat very still for a moment , relinquishing the moonlight , and then turned around . Willis was standing in the doorway . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure . All right . " " You mind if I come in ? " Willis asked , and then came in , and after standing there with a queer , uncertain grin on his face , sat down on the edge of the bed . I-Ic looked at the floor . Then he looked up and started to say something , but only held his mouth open , and closed it again without saying anything . The religious trance , and the resentment at having it disturbed , ebbed in Tim together , and he was frightened . Things were n't right with Willis , not when he hesitated like this . He saw now that Willis not only was n't stripped or in his pajamas , but that he even had an overcoat on over his other clothes , and was holding his cap in his hands . He sat there , leaning forward , trying to make up his mind to say something he did n't want to say , or could n't figure how to say , and kept turning his cap over and over in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because everything added up to show that Willis was frightened , that he himself was frightened . Tim had never seen Willis grin like that before , so that his lips trembled , and he appeared to be about to make an apology . His face did n't have its old , wise look , but was very young . Tim 's great love of everything that night shrank , but was intensified by fear , and was all for Willis , tough , quick , all-by-himself Willis , sitting there on the edge of the bed , afraid . Willis had never come wanting anything before , anything more than a buck or two from the mill , nothing real . " Did you just get in , Willie ? " " No , " Willis said , looking at the cap . " I been waiting up for you . " He tried to sound like himself and feel like himself . I lc looked up , and tried to grin , and said , " That must have been some party . It 's pretty near two-thirty . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We went out to Bowers , " Tim said .   " Oh , " Willis said , and let it drop . Tim wanted to tell him everything about the night , and what it was like to be in love with Rachel . He wanted to give himself all away like that , so that they would be brothers , and together , and Willis could tell him what it was that was so hard to say , and made him want to cry . " I took Rachel Wells , " he said . " We went out with Fred and Doris . It was a swell night . " Willis looked at his cap and nodded . " Yeah , " he said . " She 's a nice kid , I guess , only kind of snooty sometimes . " Then he apologized even for this almost extravagant praise . " Do n't mind me , my friend . What would I know about life in high society ? Anyway , " he said , looking up and trying to grin , " she do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tim also tried to grin . They sat there , trying to grin at each other , and waiting till it got so that Willis could tell what was on his mind . Willis kept putting it off . Now he became practicallymaudlin . " You 've had a crush on her for a hell of a time , ai n't you ? " he asked . " Oh , I do n't know , " Tiny said . He was bewildered by the humility of these remarks . " No ? " ' Villis asked . " Go on , " he said . " I can see through you like through a window . " Tim felt , uncomfortably but without resentment , that exceptingfor some silent and intricate movements of his soul , this was probably so . " Well , " Willis said in benediction , " she 's a swell kid . She 's smart , and she 's got a lot of guts . " Once more he began to say what was really on his mind , but could n't , and got out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make his face hard and old now . He was trying to assume the outward aspect of the man who knows all the answers in the world , and is not encouraged by them . But his hand , lighting the cigarette , was trembling . He sucked in a big lungful of the smoke and let it back out in two jets , through his nostrils . Then P295he felt better . He had assumed the attitude , and been granted the spirit . " Listen , Tim , " he said . " I got ta beat it . " Tim looked at him , trying to find out . " What 's the matter , Willie ? " " Nothing , " Willis said . " Nothing much . I got the itch . I wanta see some country . I 'm sick of this going to school and hanging around home all the time , listening to the old man jawing . " Then he said , " I wouldn't 've said nothing , only , I do n't know . I just got to thinking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough on Mom , I guess , and she is n't so good these days anyway . I do n't know . " He took a drag on the cigarette and snorted at sonic joke with himself . " Mom thinks I 'm still wet behind the ears , " he said . " I was gon na write a note for her , " he went on , " but I do n't know . I could n't figure what to write . Everything I thought of to say sounded kind of mushy . So I figured maybe it 'd be better if you 'd just tell her for me . Then it would n't be so much like running out on her , anyway . " He sat there , thinking , and holding his cap still for a minute . " Poor Mom , " he said . " She 's lonesome enough , with Grace gone , and Mrs. Turner gone too . They were about the only ones she ever really talked to . " He stood up . " Well , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? And take care of yourself , kid . " Tim thought about trying to tell their mother , in the morning , that Willis had run away . He thought how she would feel about Willis going away in the middle of the night , by himself , without saying why , or where he was going ; without even sayinggood-bye to her . She was tired all the time now . Sometimes she had to stop working in the kitchen , and go into the living room and lie down on the couch . She would lie there with a gray face and with her eyes closed . If he went in where she was , she would open her eyes and look at him , and her eyes would look bigger and darker , and he would feel that she was thinking big , strange things . The way she looked frightened him , be-P296cause usually , when she looked at him , or at Willis , or at their father , she would just be seeing whichever one of them it was , and showing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would feel that she was looking at something much bigger , something he did n't know anything about . He stood up too . " Willie , " he said , " you wait and see Mom , and talk to her . " Willis shook his head . " Not me . I just did n't want her to think I 'd run out on her without saying good-bye , that 's all . You tell the old man good-bye for me too , will you ? " he said . " I ca n't just tell them that , Willie , and you know it . You 're crazy for sleep . Why do n't you go to bed , and see how it looks in the morning ? " " No . I got to beat it now . You just tell her not to worry about me , because I got it all figured out . I 'll be all right . " " Tell me where you 're going , anyway , Willie . I have to tell them something besides that you beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't just tell them that . " Willis shook his head . " If you do n't know , then you do n't have to lie , " he said . " You never could tell a decent lie . You just say I said I was all right . I got it all fixed up with a guy 1 know , to he a jockey for him . You tell her I 'll write when everything 's fixed up . " Willis meant it , and if he meant it , there was n't any way to stop him . Many notions for stopping him came and went quickly . They were all ghostly and useless . " Willie , " he asked , " what have you done ? What 's wrong ? " Willis grinned in that way that hurt to watch , as if he were going to cry . " If you do n't know , you do n't have to lie , " he said again . " Sometimes , " he said , " it do n't matter if you 've done anything or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're just as bad off if you 're an angel . " It must have been something awful , real trouble , not just kid trouble , that Willis had been worrying about all this time . Tim felt sick for Willis . It seemed as if he himself were to blame , as if all these years he had n't seen what he saw now , that Willis P297was his little brother in the world . It seemed as if now all the other people in the world , except their mother , were angry at Willis . He felt desperate , and furious at all the other people in the world for picking on Willis . " You do n't have to look like that , " Willis said . " It 's not as bad as all that . I did n't kill anybody . There 's plenty of guys around this town make their living doing worse than what they say I did , only they 're big-shots , or they got big-shots to cover for them . Hell , " he said scornfully , " there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suckers like Dad , that do n't know plenty they ai n't telling . Yeah , only just let some kid do some little ole thing , like they been doing a hundred times worse all their lives , and you 'd think they was all preachers or saints or something . " Oh , I been around in this man 's town . Do n't you think I ai n't . It ai n't what you do that counts , it 's do you get caught . If you 're big enough to do the catching , then you do n't get caught , that 's all . Well , I 'm no big-shot , and I got no big-shot friends , and I talked with three , four of the kids been to Elko , and I 'm not having any of it . " He became ashamed of the fear his anger was showing . " What the hell , " he said . " That 's all right too . Every guy for his own self . Only I ai n't gon na be one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still standing there looking at Willis , trying to guess what Willis had done . If he knew what Willis had done , maybe he could think of something to do , or at least something to say that would keep Willis from running away . He 'd always thought he knew a lot about what went on in Reno . There were some things everybody talked about , and being in Rob ( ; Icaman'sband , you knew about a lot of other little things that went on in the clubs and down on the line and so on . I lc knew that a couple of the older fellows in the band were hop-heads already . For a little while they 'd be better than ever , really hot , if they did n't have their stuff , but then , if they had to wait too long , they 'd go kind of crazy , and would n't be able to play at all . He 'd heard a lot of opinions about where they got the stuffP298too . But now he realized that he did n't really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew about Reno was the same way . He did n't know what was behind it . He did n't know where it began . He could n't even guess what kind of trouble Willis was in , or who was after him . He did n't know anything about where Willis went at night . Willis said , " Honest , it ai n't so bad , kid . They would n't give me the little house in Carson , or anything . Only I heard tonight this particular guy figured I was in on it , and the son of a bitch says he 's gon na make something of it , so I figured I 'd give hint tirne to cool , that 's all . It ai n't so much . He 'll cool . " Anyway , " he said , making the uncertain grin , " I 'm sick of school and just hanging around two-bit joints . Where does school get you ? Oh , maybe it 's all right for you . Maybe with the things you like , you 'll get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it makin ' any jockeys , do you ? " " If it is n't so bad , Willie , Dad can fix it up , " Tim said . " You 'll really get in trouble if you run away , Willie . Willie , " he said , making up his mind , " you wait , and I 'll wake Dad up , and you talk to him . " " Nothing doing , " Willis said . " Oh , the old man 's all right , but what can he do ? Pay through the nose , maybe . Maybe not even that . This bastard 's gunning for me . If I stick around , there 'll be a lot of trouble . If I beat it , and the old man do n't know anything , well , they can just suck air , that 's all . " Look , him , " he said reasonably , " do n't take it so hard . All I want to do is ride horses . Horses are all right . So I 'm gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the laugh was shaky too . He talked like a hard man who knew the easy way around , but he looked like what he was , a scared kid . " You look like you seen a ghost , " he said . " Relax , kid , relax . I got it all figured out , I tell you . ' " Well , " he said , as if it were all settled , but still stood there . " Tim , " he said finally , " I hate to ask you , I bummed so much off you already , but . . . " He waited . Tim remembered the moss-agate , and everything he 'd P299planned about giving it to Rachel . He 'd forgotten about that when he became scared for Willis , and thinking that he had to let the moss-agate go , made him feel very lonely and defeated in his love for Rachel . But thinking about Willis running away to nowhere in particular , and about all the millions of strangers in the world , made him feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in particular , but just one , the way Willis was just one . They had to stick together , against all those millions . He could n't be one of the kind Willis was afraid of . " How much you think you 'll need ? " he asked , making a last fight with himself . He was ashamed of the question at once . How could Willis answer such a question ? " I do n't know , " Willis said . " Oh , nuts , " he added , " forget it . I 'll get along . God knows I 've chiseled you long enough . " He started for the door . " No , " Tim said quickly . " I got plenty . Really . " Willis stopped . " You 're saving it for something , ai n't you ? " " Well , " Tim said , " part of it . But there 's a lot more than I need . " He got the silver mill off the dresser , and opened the back , and poured the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills out . Willis came over and stood beside him . " You keep out whatever you was counting on , and some extra , " he said . " All I need is a few bucks to eat on till I get set . Five or six bucks would put me in the gravy . " " I do n't need any of it , " Tim said . " What I was saving it for does n't matter . " He wanted to make it sound like a joke , so it would be easier for Willis to take the money . " It was a matter of absolutely no importance , " he said , " a luxury , a foppery . You take it . You ca n't tell what you 'll need . " He scooped up the silver dollars and the change , and then picked up the wad of bills , and held it all out to Willis . Willis would n't take it . " I got enough on my mind , " he said , grinning . " Do n't you make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was you wanted . "  |p300It  was hard to talk about money like this . It made you feel cheap and a tightwad to talk about it at all . It had been better the way it was before , when Willis just took what he wanted . Tim felt miserly and traitorous because he wanted so badly to save enough for the moss-agate . He kept holding the money out . " No , " Willis said . " You keep what you need . " He was ashamed too . " Hell , " he said , " am I J. P. Morgan , with a yacht to run , or something ? What do I need of a pile like that ? " Tim counted the price of the agate onto the table , and gave the rest to Willis . It still was n't so bad  --  over thirty dollars . " Thanks , pal , " Willis said . He folded the bills into a snug wad , and put them into his watch pocket , and put the change into his side pocket . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without so much trouble . " If you wait long enough , " he said , " maybe I can do something for you , too ; stand you a beer or buy you a five-cent cigar . " He grinned . " How are you going , Willie ? " Tim asked . " Hitch hike ? " " Side-door Pullman , " Willis said importantly . " They come through slow from Sparks , and you can hook on easy , east of the Lake Street crossing , only you got to keep on the Plaza side till you 're across Sierra , so they do n't see you from the station . " Tim could sec Willis , runty and a kid and alone , no matter how tough het hought he was , sitting in the dark in a box-car , with everything banging around him , going up through the mountains in the night , and on his first time away from home . The picture made hint sad and desperate again . " Willie , chuck it , " he said . " It ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you tell Dad , anyway , and see what he says ? " " Nix , " Willis said . " What I really like is horses . I 'm going where I can ride me horses . " He was embarrassed by a sudden springing of nearly tearful affection in himself . He put his knotty little fist against Tim 's chest and shoved gently . " Do n't you worry about me , " he said . " You worry about yourself . Hell , you still think the world 's a garden , or something . " He started toward the door again .   " I 'll walk down with you , anyway , " Tim said . " Go onto bed and dream about her , " Willis said . " There 's another guy going with me . " He put on his cap , and held out his hand . They shook hands . It was funny not really to become brothers until the last time , perhaps , you 'd see each other . It still did n't seem like the last time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come out of his room in the morning , the same as usual , with his face looking old from not sleeping enough . " Do n't forget to write Mother , will you ? " Tim said stiffly . " You might drop me a line too , if you have time . " " I 'll think about it , " Willis said . He stopped in the doorway and looked at Tim again . " And you tell her I 'm sorry , will you ? I mean , about not seeing her . " " I 'll tell her . " " Well , so long , fella . " " So long . " After a moment , Tim had a great , frightened urge to go after Willis and stop him , or to go in and get his father up in a hurry , before Willis could get down there and catch the train . At the same time , he knew he would n't do either . He would let Willis do what he 'd decided to do , and it was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took him as far as the rail of the stairwell . He heard the front door close softly . He realized that they had been talking very quietly too , almost whispering . Outside , before he reached the corner , Willis began to whistle one of the marches the band always played at the race track . He whistled it loudly and clearly . He was telling the world that so far as Willis Hazard , called Willie , who was really tough , was concerned , the whole wide world was about to becomeone big race track . Then he must have gone around the corner , for the whistling faded , and finally Tim could n't hear it any longer . Tim went back into his room , and turned off the light , and stood in the window looking at the moonlight . The moonlight had changed . It looked thin and old now , and afraid of dawn . P302The trees , rustling slowly and individually , were dark and secret . Finally he turned back , and undressed and got into bed , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sacred , the eternal , the home Truckee Meadows , and echo on the mountains , and thought of Willis in the box-car , going slowly up into those mountains . The Token of the Eternal and the Touch of the MoribundTIM did n't sleep at all . He was awake when daylight came into his room . He was still lying there , thinking , when he heard his mother down in the kitchen , moving the stove lids . Then he heard his father stirring around as he always did , shaving and dressing , sometimes mumbling to himself . Finally he went downstairs too . It was morning in the house of Hazard , but Grace was gone , and now Willis was gone . Something was happening to the house of I Lazard that felt like the thin line of people creeping in the wilderness in the moonlight . Tim got dressed and went down into the kitchen . He did n't want to cat , but he did n't know how to begin about Willis , either , so he 'd have to act as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window , reading the Journal . Tim could ' see the pattern of sunlight and leaves through the paper . His mother was frying the bacon and eggs . After what Willis had said , Tim thought about how she looked . She looked very tired and gray and inwardly silent . Her hair hung down beside her face in gray , untidy strands . Mr. Hazard ended the pretending quickly , anyhow . When Tim sat down at the table , he looked up and asked , " Is n't Willis up yet ? Or did n't he bother to come home at all last night ? " So Tim told them . His father slowly let the paper down onto his knee and sat staring at him . His mother stood very still in front of the stove when he first said Willis was gone . Then she carefully pushed the frying pan onto the back of the stove , and P303came to the table and sat down across from Tim , and looked at him , trying not to believe it . When he 'd told them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how he 'd given him some money when he 'd seen there was no use arguing , and how Willis had said he had a job waiting , he looked at the table because of the way his mother was watching him , and told them good-bye for Willis , as Willis had asked him to . " Why in hell did n't you stop him ? " Mr. Hazard said . " Why in hell did n't you come in and rouse me out ? Huh ? " Then he took out his worry and fear on Tim . It would have gone on for a long time , probably , except that once , when he paused for a breath , Mrs. Hazard said faintly , " Please , Father . " I le looked at her , and stopped talking , but then , after a moment , hammered furiously on his knee with one fist . " Where did he go , Timmy ? " Mrs. Hazard asked , and Tim had to admit he did n't know . " What did he do ? What in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that , a damn fool kid his age ? " Mr. Hazard asked . Tim had to admit he did n't know that either . He 'd tried to find out , but he did n't know . " Is there anything in God 's world you do know ? " Mr. lazard roared suddenly . Tim kept staring at the table , and said , " Willie promised he 'd write . " Mr. Hazard looked at the clock on the shelf , and said " Hell , " and got up . He did n't believe Willis would write either . In the doorway , he said , " You 'll have to come down to the yard with me . Willie was s'posed to be working today . " l le went on down the hall , talking softly to himself , and making motions with his fists . Tim stood up . He hated to leave his mother sitting there , looking like that . She looked up at him , with that big darkness that went beyond him in her eyes . " You 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You ca n't work all morning with nothing in your stomach . "   " I 'm not hungry , Mom . " " I know , Timmy , " Mrs. Hazard said , getting up , " but you 'd better try and eat something . " She went to the stove , and pulled the pan with the bacon forward , and broke a couple of eggs into it . " I should have stopped him some way , I guess , " Tim said . " I 'm sorry , Mom . " " It 's not your fault , Timmy , " she said . " Willie was a very strong-headed boy . I 've been afraid for a long time he was in some kind of trouble , he 's been moping so . But he would n't tell me about it either . Your father 's just upset . He knows you could n't stop Willie , if he had his mind made up . " When the eggs were ready , she put them and the rest of the bacon on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poured him a cup of coffee , and then she went into the living room and lay down on the couch . Tim gulped the food and coffee . It was bad eating alone in the kitchen , with his father moving around upstairs , and his mother lying in the living room , thinking about Willis . Slowly Tim began to hope about the moss-agate again . The way he felt about Rachel was something he could use against all this trouble and shame , and the great , invading dread it starred for no real reason , the dread that went out beyond , like the look in his mother 's eyes . He went upstairs and changed into his jeans and blue shirt . He stood looking at the money , and at the picture of Rachel . When his father yelled at him from downstairs , he put the money in his jeans and went down . After work , Ile went downtown and bought the moss-agate . It did n't mean everything to have it , and to think about giving it to Rachel , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant something . He went over to the Park , to see if Rachel was playing tennis . He believed that if he could sit on one of the green benches and watch Rachel playing , and speak to her , and see what showed in her face today , and all the time be holding the moss-agate , in its case , in its wrappings that made it look like any small box , he would discover what it still meant . He would perhaps discover something important about what it meant against the heaviness and the loneliness . P305Rachel was n't there . There were only two people , a man and a woman he did n't know , playing bad tennis on the first court in the melancholy late afternoon . Early summer was quiet in the domes of the trees . The vista , made very long by the light , showed under the trees across the lawns and across the river . He could remember the vague unhappiness of all the summers of time . He was holding the moss-agate , and it was n't for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tree by the first court and watched the bad tennis . The man was heavy , and wore glasses , and ran stiffly . The woman held the racket out in front of her , and pushed at every shot . When the man stood still , and patted the ball past her with an air of great care and decision , she would always squeal , and then cry out , " Oh , Henry , how do you do it ? " and the man would n't say anything , but he would look very pleased . When Tim got home , he heard his father speaking loudly and angrily in the living room . At first he thought it was his mother being yelled at , but then he heard another man 's voice . " Listen , Hazard , once , I let it go . Twice ? No . I got the proof it was your kid , and this young Blair , and Tony Guielmi 's boy . Now , I want to know where they are , or do you pay me one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but do n't give me no more of your lip . I got Jeff here to back me up , and he 's been over the whole business . " " My lip , " Mr. Hazard said . " Please , Father , " Mrs. Hazard 's voice said . " You keep out of this , Anne , " Mr. Hazard said . " You go on out now , and let me talk to these guys . Listen , you bastard , " he said angrily . " I do n't take these names , " the man said . " The hell you do n't . Sit down . Go on , sit down , before I bust you one . " " I got the law . . . " the man began . " The law , " Mr. Hazard roared . " This old hag of pus ? No , and you sit down too , " he said . " Sure you got the law , " he said . " And what kind of law ? For once I 'll get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for once , too . "  |p306Tim  was standing in the hall listening to this . His mother came out into the hall . She looked as frightened as he felt , and sick . " Oh , Tim , he 'll get himself in some awful trouble . He wo n't make it any better for Willis , and he 'll just get into some awful trouble . " She sat down on the second step of the stairs , with her hands twisted together in her lap , and looked at Tim , as if pleading with him to do something about it . She knew he could n't . " I 'll tell you what kind of law you got , " Mr. Hazard was yelling . " Who is it ? " Tim whispered . " Nick Briasi and a policeman , " she whispered . " They say Willie and two other boys stole two slot machines and took the money out of them . " " You got two speed cops who do all the work , " Mr. Hazard was yelling , " because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , and about forty old wrecks like this one , that do n't see anything more than a kid stealing nickels , if they see that , friends of the mayor 's , that ca n't do a real job any more , if they ever could , so he gives ' cm uniforms and pensions ' em off . And where do you find them if anything really happens ? " Mr. Haizard told Briasi where he could find the police . Then he told hint a lot of things he must have been storing up for a long time . He mentioned a murder in Douglas Alley , a ministerwho had been forced to leave town because of a drunken speech the mayor had made from his pulpit , unexplained fires in out-of-town night clubs , prohi raids from San Francisco that busted up some clubs , but never touched others , dope peddling that nobody could trace , even in a town as small as Reno , the finances of the red-light district . Twice Briasi cleared his throat and started to interrupt , but Mr. Hazard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , " And what 's all that got to do with me ? " " You tell me that , " Mr. Hazard said . " Something , or your joint would have been padlocked a long time ago . But I 'll tell you one thing for sure . " And he argued loudly , standing in one3 o6P307place , by the sound , that one thing the rackets could n't get away with , if somebody wanted to stand up and make it a case for the people to hear , was framing kids ; that one law even the big-shots were jumpy about was the law against selling kids liquor and letting kids gamble . " You push this , you two-bit , back-alley Capone , " he yelled at Briasi , " and I 'll open it up if it costs me every nickel I 've ever made . And if I do , your friends will drop you like a hot potato , and you know it . You are n't big enough to matter that much . " " You 're talkin ' a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes ? " Mr. Hazard asked , with savage joy . " This is once somebody 's got the evidence , Briasi , " and he told Briasi some of what he knew about kids in Briasi 's place . " And the very thing you 're belly-achin ' about , Briasi , is all the evidence anybodyneeds . " " So you admit your kid swiped them machines , huh ? " " I do n't admit a damned thing . I do n't know , and I do n't care . All I know is you 've scared a fourteen-year-old kid into runnin ' away from home , and if he does come back , you ai n't gon na do a thing to him . And you ai n't gon na do a thing to those other kids , either . And nobody 's gon na pay you for your goddamslot machines , either . " That 's what you came to find out , is n't it ? " he asked more quietly . " All right . Now you know . Now get the hell out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . " All right , " he said , " now you 've shot your mouth off ... " " Take it easy , " Mr. Hazard said , breathing hard , " take it plenty easy , Briasi ; I 'm just achin ' for an excuse to knock your teeth in . " The cop started to say something . " And yours too , fatso , " Mr. Hazard said . " O.K. , " Briasi said . " I was just giving you a chance to settle quiet , that 's all . Now I 'm tellin ' you . Either you pay me that two hundred , or your kid goes to Elko . Come on , Jeff . " Tim had to move back into the hall to let Briasi and the policeman get to the front door . They were both short , square , fat men , but Briasi had thick , black , oily hair , and a kind of sloppy , animal power , while the policeman was white haired and had all his weight settled down toward his hips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hazard . They went out , Briasi first . The old policeman shut the door with great care , as if therewere somebody asleep in the house and he did n't want to wakehim up . After a minute their car turned around outside and drove off . Mr. Hazard was standing in the living-room doorway . " I told the bastard a couple of things , anyway , " he said . Mrs. Hazard was standing up now , holding onto the newel post . " Could he really put Willie in the reform school for that ? " she asked . " No , he could n't , " Mr. Hazard said . " Not a first time , anyway , " he added , looking away from her and rubbing the back of his neck . All the delight of battle was gone from his face . He appeared dazed and tired . " But he could make trouble , maybe , " he said . " You never know what ways these guys have of get-1 ting at you . " " But Willie could come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could come back , if ... " But Willie never did come back . The Disappearance of the Secret IslesTHE night of the moss-agate materialized as accidentally as the night at Bowers , though with ominous premonitions rather than with such happy omens as those of the year-book office . The premonitions were first sounded at the tennis courts on a Saturday afternoon nearly a month after Tim and Rachel , among dozens of other white-clad girls , all lovely and promisingthat evening , and dozens of other boys , all dark-clad and sweating and awkward , had marched across the stage in the gymnasium , to receive from the principal an enormous handshake , a couple of curt , nearly tearful nods , and a blue-leatherP309diploma , stamped with gold , which at the moment convinced them only of the fact that their world of four stormy and beautiful years was right then , at that touch , abruptly and wholly dissolved . It was a hot , still afternoon . The big cottonwoodat the back of the courts seemed to droop like a weeping willow . Tim and Rachel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to play again , against 1 lam Brown and Peggy Hammil . They were thirsty , and went out to the ice-cream and soda-pop wagon in the road , and Tim bought two root beers . They went back into the shade on the lawn to drink them . " When do you go ? " Tim asked , not really thinking about it . " Next week , I guess , " Rachel said . " Next week ? " Tim asked . The hot , real afternoon was gone , and they stood in the shadows of the Watteau park . " Uh-huh , " Rachel said , nodding and sipping at her straw . " Not for good ? " " Well , hardly , " Rachel said , laughing . " My family lives here . " " I mean , you 'll be back before college starts , wo n't you ? " " No , not till Christmas vacation , I guess . " Hurry , Tim Hazard , step on it . Time goes by like the leaves of November , and death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money in the silver mill ? There had to be . " Are you busy tonight ? " Rachel laughed . " I was n't fishing , Tim , " she said . " I know , " he said , with terrible seriousness , " but are you ? " She stopped laughing . " No , " she said . " I guess not , unless ... " " Could you go out to supper and a show with me , maybe ? Maybe we could go somewhere and dance afterwards , too . Ifyou 'd like to . " After a moment she said , " Thank you . That would be nice , " without looking at him . Already she was receding . The old need to declare himself , to prevent her from vanishing utterly , began to well up in him . " We could go out to the River House , " he began rapidly . " I know a guy in the band will get us in . It 's Arty Meyer 's band playing out there now , you know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arty blows a pretty hot horn himself , when he really gets going . " " I know , " Rachel defended . " I 've heard him . " " Of course there 's 011ie Blake out at the Glass Slipper , " Tim went on , " but he ca n't hold a high one , and clear , the way Arty can , and Arty . . . " and he explained Arty 's art , and from that worked into the art of Arty 's pianist , who made good arrangementswithout phony symphony introductions and perorationsor section stunts that kept a number from taking hold solid , and from that into the art of Arty 's drummer , to whom he was giving amazing skills when Ham and Peggy arrived , and Rachel greeted them with great joy and began at once to talk to them about a party Tim had n't even heard of . Then Tim sat there silent , and stared at the grass between his feet , performing the black penance of counting his lies , and feeling that he could never be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the spirit , in the world , of these three who sat there talking so casually , a sentence at a time , as if nothing mattered too much . It was only in the last set of their match , when he began to go well and not angrily , that he could feel hopeful about the evening again , and he was nearly home , running because it was late , before the fatal sin became merely a bad habit which might be cured . Even so , after he had shaved and scrubbed himself , he stood naked in the middle of his room for several minutes , his face lifted and his eyes closed , and tried to make a successful prayer for silence by means of calling up images of vast and quiet or ancient things , like Pyramid or the stars or the council rock of the lost people in the ' Truckee gorge , and when they failed , by words about the same things : " Great Spirit , Thou Who art all things , and in all things , give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that I have stood before the rock of time and numbered my little years , that I have seen the cities of man , and lo , their lights died in the darkness , and the stars were no older and shone . Grant me the peace of this understanding . Make me the well of this silence . " When it seemed to him that at least a sort of fatalistic calm might be retained , he dressed , polished his shoes , put the bills P311from the silver mill into his wallet and the coins into his watch pocket , where they would n't jingle , brushed his short hair till his scalp tingled , and fixed in his lapel a little rose from Mrs. Hazard 's vines on the back fence , which made the yard so sweet in early summer . Lastly he slipped the moss-agate in its case into his jacket pocket , pulled the jacket into exact place , and gazed for one critical yet hopeful moment at his image in the mirror . Then he darted out of the room and down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was home now , but he had made up his mind to the luxurious sedan . He rode his bicycle down to the driveyourselfgarage . Two of the fine cars were there , but the man grinned at him , and said , " Fifty dollars deposit , son , " and he had to take one of the old taxi kind , after all . It had worn , **26;934;TOOLONG , was stiff in the places where it should have been loose and loose in the places where it should have been stiff , and too slow to the gas and too quick to the brake . Ile comforted himself with the thought that at least it was a sedan , and would n't muss Rachel 's hair the way the Hazard family car would have , and drove it around for a while , to get used to its oddities . He looked at his watch every minute or so . Rachel had said seven o'clock . At two minutes to seven he arrived underthe Wells ' porte-cochere . He switched off the ignition , slipped the moss-agate case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't bulge , and sat there for a minute , reminding himself to be a well of silence . He rang the doorbell with a tremblinghand at exactly seven o'clock . He was let in by the maid , and had to wait in the hall at the foot of the stairs , a big hall , nearly a living room , with thick rugs , soft lights , and a multiple gleaming of mirrors and polished furniture . There was no one else in the hall , or in the actual living room which opened from it , but through a wide doorway on the far side of the living room came the sound of quiet voices and the clinking of silver and china . After ten minutes , Tim heard a door close above , somewhere toward the hack of the house , and the quick , light steps coming to the head of the stairs . He rose , and stood looking up . The prayer for silenceP312was forgotten . He trembled and began to vanish outward from his own mind . Rachel , wearing the gray dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shadow of the upper landing and descended quickly into the glow of the hall lights . He did n't realize that he was staring until she looked into the living room to avoid his gaze . She spoke to him from the lower landing , paused for an instant before one of the hall mirrors to pat her hair and draw the cloak closer about her throat , and went on toward the door . He always was shy and awkward in her house , and now her every motion made him feel still more clumsy , and a little as if he were kidnapping her . He fumbled the handle of the car door as he helped her in , and they were quiet all the way out to the River House . Tim was quiet enough while they were there too , though not with the wise quiet of proportion for which he had prayed . They took their places at a table for two in the back corner , and he got off to a bad start by forgetting to take Rachel 's order , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to worry again about how he was going to give her the moss-agate . Here , in her presence , and among worldly and much older people in evening clothes , it seemed to him often that even the intention of giving it to her was preposterous . Also , as he looked at her sitting just on the other side of the little table , her eyes watching her plate , her small , slender , brown hand rising and falling with the shining spoon or fork , he was assailed by waves of possessive tenderness in which many of the events of his legends became confused with the present , and then , when the moment became itself again , he would seem to be holding time off by the strength of his single will , or rather , by the bewilderingintensity of his yearning . He would be on the verge of tellingher everything she meant to him . He could never begin cleanly , though , as one might strike a true note with the first , sharp down-bow . Instead , he would ask her if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special salad dressing , or if she wanted somethingelse to drink , since she was n't drinking her coffee , or if she wanted him to get her cloak , since there was a window open in their corner . He would find himself helplessly insisting thatP313these changes could be made , and when the tiny fury darted in her eyes as she said , " It 's all very nice , Tim , really , " he would see at once how she would loath to have him say what he was really leading up to , and the urge would ebb away , leaving him as naked as a tidal rock out of water . He was flooded with equal swiftness , however , as when Rachel said , laughing , " You do n't seem to be eating very much , Tim , " and he perceived that he had been sitting there staring at nothing . All his hopes were set in motion again because she had noticed this . So he was nearly silent all through dinner , but only with an inwardly roaring alternation between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dessert , the rest of Arty 's band came in , and the dance music began . Arty stood in front of the band and got each number under way , and then turned around , his trumpet under his arm , and conducted vaguely with his free hand , while he watched the dancers and listened for his cue . He was watching for someone to smile at . Arty 's smile was famous . It was no toothy , professional grin , but a slowly widening , almosttremulous salute to some one person . He would lean over and speak and smile like that , and the event was portentous . He would seem to be paying no attention to the band , but when his break neared , he would lift the trumpet slowly , but pointing it high and tensely , as if he were about to blast the roof off , and then , just a bit behind the beat , would come in with a very soft , high , clear note , which he held for an unbelievably long time before he tumbled down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all around it . That hold-note entry and the hold-note smile were practically Arty 's personal signature . In spite of his abortive lecture in the afternoon , or perhaps partly because of it , the whole performance , even the careful but sweet simplicity of the band , seemed as stagy and false to Tim as a Paul Whitemanintroduction . Nevertheless , it was good dance music , with a strong , unbroken rhythm that took hold , and he and Rachel danced . The second time they danced , they passed close to the platform , and Arty 's great , sad eyes , in the white , sad , almost homely face , selected them . He leaned over and asked , " How P314are you , Timmy ? " in the slow drawl that worked like the smile . He began the smile for Rachel . They had to stay there , dancing in one place , looking up at him . " Ah 'm glad you came out , " Arty said , and looked at Rachel again . " Miss Wells , Mr. Meyer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Arty asked . " Wells , " Tim said stubbornly . " Please , you tell me , " Arty said to Rachel . " He 's keepin ' secrets . " Rachel blushed and whitened , and laughed quickly and said , " Rachel . " " That 's better , " Arty said . " I 'm Arty , and glad to know you , Rachel . Not that I blame Timmy here for bein ' a bit close . " I le moved along the platform beside them when Tim started to dance on . " How 's about takin ' the fiddle break on a couple with us , Timmy ? Huh ? " " No , thanks , " Tim said . " Not tonight , I guess , Arty . " " One , maybe ? Moonlight and Roses ? " " I do n't feel like playing , " Tim said . When they went hack to the table , Rachel did n't sit down . " Let 's go , " she said . " It 's getting too crowded to dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him to answer . He caught up with her in the entrance to the lounge , where the cloak room and the gaming tables were . He took hold of her elbow . " Did you want me to play that , Rachy ? " he asked . " Of course not , if you do n't want to . " He let go of her arm . " I 'd just as soon play , if you want me to . " " Heavens , Tim , what difference does it make ? Will you get my wrap , please ? " " It 's just that it all sounds so phony tonight , " Tim said . " I did n't feel like getting up there and playing stuff like that , on your last night , and everything . " " It 's not my last night , whatever that has to do with it . "   " I mean for me , " Tim pleaded . " I did n't want to get up there with all that lousy jazz , and ... " Rachel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little fury in her eyes again . " Tim Hazard , " she said shakily , " you 're the most conceited boy I ever knew . " Then Tim was staring at her . I-le was astonished and deeply hurt , and bewildered . How could she think that of him , of all things ? " Please , " she said again , " will you get my wrap ? " It was n't until they were outside that he remembered he had n't tipped the check-girl . He was mortified by the oversight . Everything was going wrong . It was n't until they were nearly in town , and he had to find out what they were going to do , that he could speak again . " We could still see a second show , " he said . Rachel did n't want to see a show . She did n't want to go anywhere else to dance , either . She said she had a headache . He knew she wanted to go home , and he knew he would only be tanking things still worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began in him . But he could n't take her home like this . How could he ever start to give her the moss-agate when it was like this between them ? " We 'll just drive for a while , then , " he said . " Maybe the air will help . It was awful stuffy and smoky in there . Where do you want to go ? " " I do n't care , " Rachel said . " Let 's go out the Pyramid road , " he said . Wonderful places n the Pyramid road came to his mind , big places with barren ountains and long , empty valleys . There would be a moon beorelong , too . It came to him that they could even go all the ay out and look at the moonlight on the lake . It would take an our to get out there , and maybe the moon would be up then , nd he could give her the agate while they looked at the lake . t would n't seem so important or so hard to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thinking of being with Rachel and poking at the moonlight on Pyramid .   " All right , " Rachel said , sighing . She Cooked out the window on her side . " But I ca n't be out late , Tim . Really , I ca n't . " They passed through the city , and out the familiar road beside the race track , and around to the fork by the ranch house that looked like an old roadhouse . Tim swung the car up into the hills . When they were over the first summit , and the lights were gone , and the big darkness was around them , and stars over the mountains , he spoke . " What makes you think I 'm so conceited ? " " Oh , Tim , please . I 'm sorry . " " If it was on account of what I said about Arty 's band . . . " " Tim , I did n't mean it . It does n't matter . " " Yes , it does , " he said . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't really mean Arty 's band was no good . " Rachel clenched her hands in her lap and looked down at them . Tim saw that , but still he was drawn on . " Arty 's got a swell band . It was n't anything about Arty 's band . It was just because it was your last  --  my last night with you , and I did n't want to play that stuff . I do n't know ; it just was all wrong . You always make me think of big music , like Beethoven or Tschaikowsky , or Debussy 's La Mere . Even Moonlight and Roses is all wrong ; too kind of soupy ; too much make-believe . " This was true , as far as it went , but he did n't go on because just that much , with Rachel sitting there looking at her hands , sounded like a pose or even a lie . " Anyway , " he said , trying to laugh and sound as if he were joking , " I did n't want to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one number . Not tonight . " But that did n't lead anywhere either , because Rachel just looked out at the first moon-glow beginning over the mountains , and did n't answer . He began to drive faster , hoping that if it did n't seem to take too long , she would n't care how far they went . They came off the humping road between the near hills set with junipers , and into the Spanish Springs Valley . They fled across the flat , through the soft , wuthering gloom . The Spanish Springs turn-off came into the headlights .  | " Will you please turn around here , Tim , " Rachel ordered . He slacked off , but could n't wholly believe she had said that . " Tim , I have to go home . Turn around , please . " He turned into the Spanish Springs road . It was a little longer way home , and it would be one big valley , anyway . " We can go back this way , " he said . " It 's hardly any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If you want to . " The moon came up , immense and pure and white , while they were in the valley . Its soft light stole down the western hills , and lay at last over the brush all about them . Hurry , Tim Hazard , step on it . Time can no more be held than moonlight . On the hills it is forever , but in the heart it is a moment , and death is the moon that casts it . Cattle lying in the brush slowly lifted their white faces to watch the car approach . The car passed the lone ranch house at the center of the valley . The windows were all dark . The people were asleep in there , full of the wonderful peace of their valley . The moonlight twinkled in the leaves of the trees , and lay like frost on the haystacks . Rachel did n't speak . The moonlight , in little patches , lay on the lawn under the trees at Wells ' , too , and there was no light in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window above the door . Tim stopped the car , and then , hesitantly , shut off the motor . After that he was powerless to move or speak . Rachel sat there oo , poised on the edge of the seat , waiting for him to get out nd open the door for her . " Well , " she said finally , and laughed little , and took hold of the door handle . " Rachel , " Tim gasped , " Rachel , " as if he were going on adlong , but then could n't say anything more . He leaned toardher . " I have to go in now , " she said quickly , and opened the door . " No , " he said . " Just a minute ; I have something . " He fuinledhurriedly , and managed to get the case out of the side cket . He had n't thought before that it was unkind to give her c case without any wrapping on it , so that she would have to wen it in front of him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all , but most often had imagined , with quickeningp318pulse , how she would open the case and look at the moss-agate , and be pleased and touched , and then look at him with questionsin her eyes , and begin to understand . Now he wished the case was wrapped , but it was too late to mend that . He thrust it at her , so that she took it almost in self-defense . " Here , " he said . Rachel sat holding the closed case and looking at him . " It 's nothing , " he said . " I just got it to go with the gray dress . " Then he said , foolishly , " You have the gray dress on . I 'm glad you have the gray dress on . " Rachel looked down at the case . Finally she opened it slowly , as if afraid something detestable would spring from it . Tim held his breath and watched her face eagerly . The little light on the dash showed clearly her knees , and her hands holding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face looking down at the case . Now she would begin to understand . Her face did n't change . She turned her head , but did n't look at his face , but at his shoulder . " But I ca n't take presents like this , Tim , " she said . " Why ca n't you ? " he asked . The question sounded harsh and rude . I le hardly knew that he had asked it . " Because I ca n't , " she said . " I could n't take a present like thi front any boy , " she said more rapidly , and snapped the ca closed and put it on the seat between them . She was going to ge out . Ile could feel that she was going to get out and run up th steps too quickly for him to follow , and go in , and close the door . " Rachel , " he begged , " it is n't anything . I did n't mean any thing . It was just on account of the gray dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poised on the edge of the seat again , but the way h was begging stopped her , though she could n't look at him . " Please , " he begged , " please take it , " and held the case out her . " I ca n't , Tim , " she said sharply , tremulously . He slid across the seat toward her and took her hand . Shetried to draw it away , and he would n't let her . He held her . He P319did n't try to put his arm around her . That would be acting as if he wanted to neck or maul her , when what he really wanted was to beg for his life . Even in his dreadful confusion he understood that . Already he felt debased and vile , because he had held her against her will . Yet he had to hold her ; he had to make her understand . He was shaking , as if from a strong chill , and everything he did was clumsy . He dropped the case in her lap and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act of subservience , and the touch of her hand against his mouth , overwhelmedhim . He wished actively to debase himself before her , to be grossly humble . He did n't know what he was thinking or doing . He kissed her hand again and again . Rachel struggled once more to take her hand way from him . " Stop it , " she whispered sharply , and then , " Please , stop it , " with a little panic . When he still would n't release her , she sat stiff and motionless , waiting for him to know what he was do-'rig . He did n't understand what she whispered , but he felt the till , hostile waiting of her body . With her hand yet against his mouth , he bowed his head into her lap , and lay there , half curled into the seat . Even with his body , he was debasing himself . Heas pleading with her physically . It did n't seem to him that heould ever be able to think of a word to say to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat still . He felt the soft dress , which had been cool when he put his face against it , grow warm from her thigh beneath it . Then , for the first time , he knew that he desired her also . ' I'he desire must have been there for a long time , but he hadnever known . In sultry day-dreams which came on him some- ' nes when he was alone , he had imagined possessing many ls . He had tried , several times , to imagine possessing Rachel . had been very different from imagining the others . They ere all girls he knew had given themselves to more thanc boy , or women he saw in places where the band played , nit whom it was easy to imagine anything . Often , in thinkaboutthem , he had invented ugly or humorous or violently portunate , or even cruel introductions to the act . When hed thought of possessing Rachel it was always in one of the P320legends , and came as an exalted union which they both wanted desperately and tenderly , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he had touched her as if she were sacred and fragile . More than that , although it was easy to imagine the entire act with those other girls , or with any girl who attracted him at all , even if he knew she was n't easy , it was impossible for him to imagine the consummation with Rachel . Ile had imagined her , in many tales , as ready to give herself to him , and had even written her some love songs which were n't purely idealistic . He had imagined her waiting for him in a gshadowy bedroom , with moonlight in the windows andgreaton the floor . Two or three times he had succeeded in seeing her on the bed , naked and small and delectable , and full of a deathlesslove for him . But when , even with the greatest reverence , and he never approached her otherwise , he was about to enfold her in his arms in a corner of moonlight from the window , in a world of tragedy and loneliness , and in an ecstasy of yearning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God is near man , he would no longer he able to see her . Either the vision would disappear entirely , or he would find that he was pressing to him one of the other girls , with whom he could imagine actually doing such a thing . A familiar face , in no way like Rachel 's , would materialize beneath him where hers had dissolved , and be laughing or weeping or strained with the urge . It had been literally impossible for him to imagine possessing Rachel , anhe had n't even dreamt of doing so except in the legends . Yet now he desired her terribly , with a kind of cherishing violence which pierced him like the far cry of a trumpet . He contained this desire and his ecstasy of adoration and humble ness , and his dread at the intolerable idea of losing her . N longer kissing , he pressed his face more deeply into her hand , so that his own hand was pressed deeper into her thigh . Thcr began to be repeated in his mind an image in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor of the car , and w embracing her knees , with his face buried against them . I it could feel this coming . He had a convulsive desire to accede to this foresight , and make the final gesture of worship and or P321desire which was not brutal . He must not let himself . To resist it was as difficult as struggling against the repetition of an old vice . He lifted his head , feeling it very heavy , as if it were made of stone . It was still harder to let her hand go , but he did . He moved back behind the wheel of the car , and buried his head upon his arms , and muttered that he was sorry . Rachel did n't answer , but neither did she get out of the car . " But I did n't mean to do anything you would n't like , " he said , raising his head . He sat up straight and pounded softly on the steering wheel with his fist , and stared at the steering wheel . He began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " It 's because I love you . I always have loved you . I always will . Only I 've never been able to tell you . I can remember everythingabout you . Do you remember when we first met ? " He looked at her . She was watching him as if half fascinated , but when he looked , she stared down at her hands and shook her head . " I do , " he said . " I remember everything about you . That was n't the first time I saw you . The first time was out at the race track . There was a horse called Sunday Wind running . You were sorry for her too . " He went on telling her all that he remembered about her . He began it as an apology , in those short sentences , with waits between . But then he began to speak more easily . He even told her how he had felt about her at times . He could n't bring himself to explain why he talked so much sometimes , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell her that he had tried to make love to her on a bed in his mind , and besides , he was n't sure why he talked so much . He knew that Bing with her started it , and that often he could n't stop , though he felt the dreadful black shame , as at a form of owardice , but he did n't understand that he did it because c could n't say what he meant . He thought of telling her , and hen remembered that she did n't like what he was doing ow : reminding her of all the times he could remember , but she ) uld n't . He flowed into telling her about poems and songs heP322had written for her . He was pleading again , and almost hope fully . He still spoke with some confusion , but he was rushing ; he was trying to get it all out . Before he knew what he was saying , he was proposing to her . " I know  --  not now , " he was stammering . " Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know you would  --  I 'd wait till the end of my life if I knew you would . We could be engaged , Rachel . " " No , " she said , " I 'm not ready to be engaged to anyone . " " Rachel , I 've always loved you . There 's never been anybody ... " " What about Marjory Hale ? " Rachel asked . The question was curt . Suddenly he came out of the fog and saw that actually she was still just waiting for him to finish and let her go . " You do n't believe me , do you ? " he asked incredulously . " Of course I do n't , " she said . " Why should I ? " He had no answer for this . I le had said everything . He had believed he was making everything very clear . Rachel got our of the car and stood in the driveway , with the door open . She was holding out the case with the moss-agate , and appeared to have been goaded into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I could n't use it , any way . Nobody wears things like this any more . " He was crushed by the scorn of this rejection , and yet not angry at her . His defeat and loss were too great for anger . I lc did n't even understand , really , what she had said . That final revelation of his dream-hound blindness , the knowledge that he had reverently presented her with an ornament that was actuallyin bad taste and unusable , could come only later , when he was alone . Now she did n't seem to be commenting on the gift at all , but rejecting him , making her final declaration that he was a person from whom she could not accept gifts . If only she would keep the agate , he would save something ; he wash ' sure what , but something . " Please , " he said , with the dignity of admitted defeat , " I wish you 'd keep it . I got it for you . "  | " Well , thanks , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He started to get out to go to the door with her . " Never mind , thanks , " she said quickly . " I 'll let myself in . " So , with his face burning at this last mistrust , he sat where her words stopped him , on the end of the scat , with one foot out on the running board , and watched her run up the steps into the heavy shadow under the fanlight , and saw her silhouetted against the light beyond the opening door , and then the door closed behind her . The Fall of the Houseof HazardIRS . HAZARD failed rapidly that summer , though it was long time before Tim and Mr. Hazard understood that there as anything wrong with her besides weariness and worry ) out Willis . It required a shock , and an event which changed c routine of their lives , to make them see . Tim told me somelingof this period during that afternoon when we sat on the ft at Tahoe , and mentioned incidents from it and thoughts ' out it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also toldmore about it quite recently , though , so that probably , inmain , it is the older Tim Hazard , with his longer perspec-e and changed sense of values , whom I quote , as nearly as I , in his own words . Needless to say , I did n't sit there with acil and a shorthand notebook while he talked , nor am I awell , any more than Tim is a Dr. Johnson . In fact the ideatelling Tim 's story came up during a conversation with Lawrence Black , years after most of its events had taken place , I actually started to put it together not because it is unique , because there is anything world-shaking about any of itsinhabitants , but rather for the very contrary reason . But at , if I do n't get down Tim 's exact words , I 'm quite sure of P324the important matters , his attitude , and the incidents he consideredsignificant . " Most men , " Tim said , " as the more thoughtful of them , and all women , know , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a kind of preoccupied blindness to their in ' mediate surroundings . It does n't matter whether heaven or the stock exchange is their destination ; the result is the same . find Dad and I were even blinder than usual at the time , I guess . I was staggering around in the world of the realists which Rachel had left me , fighting off my desire to dream as if it were a mortalsin , and still dedicating my future to her memory , so to speak , although it had become painfully clear to me that so far as actually spending any of that future with her was concerned , it was ruled out by a dilemma which neither dreams nor hope could any longer obscure , to wit , that only if I ceased lovin Rachel would I have any chance of becoming a being Rach might love . I was constantly pondering this dilemma , and th nature of the world into which it led me by the asses ' bridge , if every other problem which confronted me were dependen at some point in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought for a minute , and said , " As , of course , the were , " and went on . " I ) ad was preoccupied too . It began with the business o Willis and Briasi , I guess , though I 'm judging only by sym toms . I never learned what came of that matter , if anythin Nothing , I suppose . At least nothing ever happened to the oth boys who had been involved with Willis . But the Briasi bus ' ness was n't all there was to the change in Dad . It reached f back of that , as I learned the following winter . At any rate , h changed , changed until even I noticed it . He had always take the offensive in his monologues before , using Mother or me as h ' other self , and he had always picked individual targets by name some lawyer , politician , mine owner , rancher , union organizer c liquor racketeer , or just some man with whom he had argued a the lumber yard about the curing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and into generalities , complaining in det P325and with considerable sophistry and alarmingly little profanity , that it was inevitable that things should be like that in Nevada , considering its barrenness , its small population and its history of fortune-chasing . I suppose this enlargement from the personalto the general , from the specific what ' to the theoretical why , ' might be considered an advance in thinking , but it was n't in Dad 's case . It was simply a loss of power . Sometimes this loss of power showed even more plainly . 1lc would just sit there by the kitchen table , with his hands folded between his knees , as if trying to make himself small , not touching his beer , letting his pipe go out in the saucer the used as an ash tray , staring at nothing , saying nothing . There would be a hopeless , far-away , muddled expression on his face , as if some inner goal toward which he had been working or hoping had disappeared or been removed beyond reach . " Poor Mother was worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sat there like that . She 'd try to make talk with him about the lumber yard or his horseshoes or hunting or going out to Antelope Valley , or she would get him into a game of doublesolitaire or two-handed pinochle , or cribbage . Mother did n't like cards herself ; they bored her ; but Dad was like Willis . Everything in the world was win or lose with him , and he loved cards . " It seems strange , and kind of terrible now , to think of Mother worrying about him , and about Willis , and about me too , for that matter . She would sit there at the kitchen table , gray with weariness or pain , and deal the cards and make mistakes , but keep trying until some of Dad 's combative spirit returned , and he boomed out a challenge or two at her , and began to drink his beer as if he liked it . Then she 'd laugh at him , and dare him back , and they 'd be quite foolish and happy together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dad had his obsession , and I had mine , and neither of us really saw what was happening to Mother . " Then , one night , when I was up in my room , Dad called me rum downstairs . His voice was strange , frightened and too loud . I was working on a score , and usually , when I was doingP326that , I 'd say I was coming right away , and think I was too , but I would n't budge for an hour . This time I piled right downstairs . Mother was on the couch in the living room , where T ) ad had placed her . She had fainted and fallen out of her chair while they were playing cards in the kitchen . Dad had poured water on her face , and taken off her shoes , and tried to force a drink of whisky on her , and now he did n't know what to do . He was standing there looking at her , and twisting his hands together . " Well , there 's no use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took her to the hospital that night , and a couple of weeks later they operated on her for abdominal cancer . She stayed very weak , but the pain was gone , and for two or three months she seemed to be getting better . She could n't do anything , though , and her mind tormented her . All her life she 'd been used to working all the time , at a never-ending procession of the same little tasks , and by that time such content as she won came from her work . Rest and thought had been pleasuresto her only because of the work . Now she had to watch Dad or me doing the work , clumsily or slowly , or some woman Dad would get in once in a while , and she had too much time to think and feel . She had a big reaching and yearning in her all the time , and had no art to be tranquil by philosophy . That big quality in her had never had a chance to be satisfied or disciplinedenough for that . Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes , when Dad and I were both away , she would try to work to quiet herself . We 'd find her on the couch , exhausted , when we came home , and she would smile at us , and confess . The hardest thing for her to confess , I think , was that she could n't last at any work for more than a few minutes . A haunting feeling of uselessness and loneliness , and of error in her past , overcame her . " She was all right when the three of us were together in the evening , just listening to the radio or playing cards . Having us there seemed to fulfill and excuse her . She liked to hold Dad 's hand , and would reach for it sometimes even when we were playing cards . She would look at me in the same way , as if she wanted to hold me . But once in a while , even during such eve-P327nings , her eyes would change ; the darkness inside her would show through them and she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it before , and look at Dad and me as if we were strange too , and were only small figures in the foreground of what she was really looking at . In those few months her hair had finally turned quite white , and her face was white too , and thin , and the old lines were graven more deeply in it , and there were new ones , fine , intricate , indecisive traces , like the beginnings of crumpling , between them . " We talked to encourage her all the time , making plans for the week-end trips we would take when she was well enough , and for renting a place on Tahoe for a whole summer , but I believeshe knew , after that first operation , that she was dying . She would smile at our lusty planning , and add a few ideas of her own , and describe what she liked best about the places we were discussing , but never as if she were really going to than again , and suddenly , in the midst of our busy cheerfulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see that she was n't listening , and that what she was watching came from wayback . " Tim sat remembering , and then said , " There are a number of little incidents I recall very clearly , so it 's not hard to guess the rest now , in spite of how little she said and how much I must have missed . " Once I came in to dust the living room . She was sitting in ad 's big chair by the front window . When I had worked round close to her , I stopped to kiss her . Usually , when I did at , she would just smile . This time she took my hand with both hers , and held it , and looked at me . She wanted something rribly ; her eyes tugged at me more than her hands . But I guess hat she wanted was something nobody has words for . She did n't say anything until I had kissed her again , and she had letof me . Then she said , I like this time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and looked out the window again , so that I looked - . " It was late fall . The light was clear and mellow , and there s only a gentle warmth and stillness in it . The leaves had shinned out on the poplars , and those that were left were yel- P328low . You knew , without seeing , that the Indian-summer haze was on the mountains , and that Pyramid would be so quiet that you could hear every wing-clap of a pelican for miles . The melancholy wanderlust is in that time of year , as the gay and savage one is in the spring . I told her yes , I liked it too . " It seems to make everything so much truer , ' she said . " Another time she asked me how my music was coming , and we talked about it . That is a very good time to remember . We had never talked so much about the music before , and she was happy about it . It was n't until she had asked me various questionsabout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she was after . She was trying , without talking about the money in it , to assure herself that I would be happy and able to make a living with my music . She had been secretly with me against my father , in this , all the time , but only because she saw what I did n't see myself , I got into such agonies over it sometimes ; she saw I was happiest when I was at my music . I believe she was afraid that my father was right , that I could never live by it , yet that if I could n't , I would be unhappy , lacking something big and central to give meaning to the rest , as she had lacked it . When I understood that , I was really frightened , because I saw that she was knotting the ends of life together in her mind , getting ready to leave the whole work , yet with that terrible , empty feeling that she had n't finished . " Once she asked me about Rachel , too . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describing how she had played in some match , something like that , and then only when Willis was n't there . But I suppose I had shown more than I realized ; I was no poker-face , and Mother never missed anything that was going on in any of us . She was n't a thinker , or a good talker about thoughts , but her emotions , her instinctive understanding of emotion , reached all about into life , like the roots of a forest . I talked to her about Rachel , but she knew something was wrong , and never asked me about her again . " Sometimes , when I was in bed , I could hear her and Dad talking in their room , long after they were usually asleep , or after Dad was , anyway , and I would fall into a kind of ragingp329despair in which I hated God , so to speak , because I knew she was knotting up more ends . " Once in a while I played the violin for her in the evening . She liked it better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She would smile and say that the piano seemed to her like a person who kept on talking when you had something else on your mind , and that no wind instrument seemed to mean anything to her by itself , but that it rested her , smoothed her out , ' she said , to hear a violin . I could never play it very long , though , because it made Dad uneasy , and after about so long , usually , he would get up and go out to the kitchen , and begin to play solitaire , and Mother would worry about our driving him off . " I remember twice , between the operations , when I think she was really happy . The first time was when the note came from Willis . It was the only note he ever wrote home , and it was very short and stiff . It was written in pencil on one side of a piece of gray scratch paper , and said that he was at a ranch on the edge of a town in Texas , training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wages and the food were fine , and he had been in the money better than half the time in his jockeying , which gave him quite a bit in bonuses . His closest approach to a word of affection was to tell Mother not to worry about him , because to train horses you had to train yourselftoo , and he was being good . It was hard for Willis to speak truthfully when he was moved . But after letting Dad and me sec this letter , Mother kept it with her all the time , and she wrote to Willis every day , even when she was unable to get out of bed , right up until she could n't keep her mind clear because of the pain and drugs . Even then , when she had an easier spell , she would ask me to write to him for her , and I would sit by her bed and write while she told me , a little at a time , what to say . " The other time I remember came late in her last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday . We found a shelteredplace under the rocks on a beach near Incline , where she could sit in the sun and look at the lake and at the mountains on the California side . She did n't even want to talk , and we left P330her alone most of the time . Dad sat in the car up in the woods , and smoked a cigar and read the Sunday paper , and then went to sleep . Mother was tired from the ride , and we had fixed her with a blanket and pillows so she could go to sleep too , but she did n't . She slept verylittle during those last months , even before the pain returned and prevented it . She would lie there silent and motionless , but wide awake , feeling things strongly , remembering , always hunting for something , the answer which would bring real quiet , inside as well as out . " I wandered off among the boulders and trees up the shore , and took a short swim in the icy water off the point , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . The peace of Tahoe had worked into me , and I felt gentle and clear . Mother felt the same way , I think . She smiled at me , and there was none of that terrible wanting in her look . She was sitting up against a boulder with the blanket across her lap , and had in her hand a few tiny carnelians which she had picked up from among the beach pebbles around her . " She said , making it sound like a gentle joke , I wonder if heaven could be any better than this , Timmy ? ' " It nearly broke my heart , and yet it made me happy at the same time . It was as if she had won through to something , or more as if we had wade a great , final discovery together , perhapsabout the size of things , and the extent of time , and the point at which an individual can let go and stop blaming and urging himself . It 's hard to explain the feeling , but you know it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in everything , with all the weight off , as if you had discovered what you should always be , but ca n't because the affairs of human beings keep pecking at you , or there are walls , all kinds of walls , which shut out the greater , non-human part and keep the balance wrong in the mind . Anyhow , it 's as close to religion as any experience I know . She had it that afternoon , and it must have been a marvel and a treasure to her , considering the weight of her burdens , and the fact that she was n't put together to let go and feel that everything was out of her hands . Maybe that kind of ease comes permanently to some very old people , but P331Mother was n't very old , and I doubt if she could have let go if she had been . She suffered for people ; everybody 's trouble and pain were hers . For her to rest , there had to be a positive feeling , not just that she could let go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for one Sunday afternoon , at least , she believed that . " I like to think about Mother that afternoon , " Tim said slowly . " I like to remember her just as she was , sitting there in the sun with her handful of carnelians , watching the clouds . Great , domed thunderheads had thrust up a mile into the sky from behind the western mountains , and were hanging there , almost unmoved , as if they had established the balance too . They made a shadow upon the hazy mountains and a deep garden of clouds under the water , which was perfectly still . Later in the afternoon , they shattered the sunlight , which streamed up from them in visible rays , and struck off at angles onto the mountains and the water . Mother 's face looked rested , and the light from above the clouds glowed on it as from within , the way a colored sunset glows in the desert hills . I remember how thin her wrists and hands were , and how white they appeared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a peculiar strength , like that of ecstasy , in their quiet , a strength which was equal to that of the water . " That winter , " Tim said finally , " the cancer took hold once more , and she was all twisted out of shape by the pain . The doctors were afraid to operate on her again in this altitude , so Dad took her to San Francisco and she died there , two days after the second operation . " Dad sent me a wire , but I did n't really believe she was dead . I kept thinking of her as she had been before that last awful stage . The bony , bleached , misshapen creature of the last days , with nothing , or only unintelligent , unfathomable pain , in her eyes , seemed to me like another woman , because of whose fate I pitied the chances of mankind , but whom I could not greatly pity , herself , or even feel strongly about in any way , because she was n't quite real , and certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the reality of Mother which was P332still alive in the house , and though I knew she was gone , I believedshe would be back shortly , and reclaim all the suggestions of herself . " It was n't until Dad came home that I really knew she was dead . He had buried her in San Francisco , and then stayed on there for a week , looking up old friends and places , he said , and then had gone down to Grace 's for another week . I met him at the train . He shook my hand as if I were a sympathetic stranger . He looked old , exhausted and indifferent . He forgot that he had a handbag , and I had to go back to the platform after it . He did n't say anything on the way home , and that evening all he talked about was the bills . He did n't see how he was ever going to pay for the surgery and the burial . He was bitter . He said you 'd think they 'd bought her body and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could get any rest . He talked about the price of the hospital room , the burial lot , the stone . Seeing him come in without Mother , and sit at the table in the kitchen with me , and Mother not there , had robbed me of all the comfortingghosts . My senses were wickedly clear , and everything that had been whispering , She is still alive , ' now said aloud , She is certainly ( lead . ' I is talk about the bills made me very angry . Mother , who had spent , and spent was the word , all her life on him and the three of us children , and without even the return of recognition and confidence , except from Grace , Mother was dead , and all he could do was fuss about bills . " But after that , I got to know him for the first time . It was then I remembered and understood about him and Mother sitting on the front porch , or going to a show without any of us , and the way Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he seemed the most discontented and self-centered and cruel . " Breakfast was the only time I saw much of him . He was at work all day , and I 'd started out at the River House with Arty that fall , trumpet and arrangements , so my work began with the dinner hour and went on till early morning . But I used to get up for breakfast , to see a little of him , and once in a while we 'd have an early supper together , or both be home for Sun-P333day . I began to see that his talk about expenses was just part of his end-of-everything feeling . He did n't want to have any responsibility for anything ever again . He felt that his life was really done , except dragging through the rest of his time , and that he was wronged by people who insisted upon acting as if he were still a living man . " For a couple of days he just told nee facts about the operation , the funeral , the old haunts he had seen and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but as it might have been full of some dull selections he had memorized years before , and could n't get rid of , but did n't care about . Then he began to talk to me as if I were anyone he did n't actively dislike , but aLso I began to understand . All he was doing was remembering . He had wanted to do something entirely different with his life . I lc had wanted to be a sailor , and , in time , a merchant-marine officer . His heart had been sold to tramp steamers , and , in a ghostly way , it still was . He did n't say so . He just told me again and again about incidents of the seven or eight years he had worked around the San Francisco waterfront and been a sailor on the coastwise freighters , from Seattle to Panama , and I could feel a strange breath of hopeful youth in his words . He was n't blaminganyone . He did n't see that it could have happened any other way . But there it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when he had lived . Since then he had been remembering them , but not saying much , until Mother died . Then they came back to the top again . " When Willis was born , he had given it up , because his advancehad been slow , and because Mother was n't well , and the doctors said , Get her away from the sea ; get her up onto the desert . ' " All the rest of his memories were about Mother , and he felt guilty toward her . Behind his violence and independence , his discontent and his contenting himself with petty things , there had been , I believe , a great love for her . They had it , and Mother had known it . Yet it had never been joyous or tranquilor fulfilled . It was queer . I would have said , thinking over my whole boyhood , that Mother was the one who had done all  |p334the  loving and giving , that if Dad had ever possessed anything that big and strong , he had worn it out with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he knew it , knew that he had worn out something big , for he was n't merely remembering , but in a degree confessing , when he put his mind in order before me , that all that had been worth while of his life had been the sea , and Mother . I had never heard him talk so much before , except in anger or complaint . " After about a month , he was different one morning . He had made up his mind . An old friend in San Francisco had offered him a job on the waterfront , and he was going . He did n't want to live in that house any longer . I wanted to stay in Reno almost as much as he wanted to leave , and it did n't take much of an argument to make him leave me . He did n't really care where I went . He only felt that he should have cared , because Mother would have worried . " So a realtor 's sign was nailed to the front porch of the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cocksure on the house , for it was glossy white with new , red letters , and the paint on the house had been powdered and blistered by the sun .

Additional item , in all seasons but winter , constant sound of leaves of poplars to be heard through front window .   The Dark Age ofTimothy Hazard , an Interlude Including the Tokens of the Waste Land , the Empty City , the White Horse and the Paper Prayer , ButAlso Including the Sanctuary of the Peavine QuarterTHE next two or three years were a ceaseless battle in the soul of Tim Hazard . It is impossible to fix the lines , or even the time , of this period . I could select arbitrary dates for its beginning and its end . Let 's say it began the day the real-estate sign was removed from the house of Hazard , and ended when Tim accidentallymet Rachel on Virginia Street for the second time , and did n't have to run away . Let 's say that at I o : 47 in the morning of such a day in such a year , the assistant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porch , waved his hand and shouted , " Whoa ! That 's good , " and that at 3:19 of such a sunny , windy day in August , of such another year , in the mouth of Douglas Alley , Rachel Wells , with her arms full of bundles , uncertainly , half-laughingly said , " Hello there , Tim Hazard , " and Tim looked up and saw her again . That would sound definite enough for the World Almanac . But when did the dark years really begin ? The moving-van had nothing to do with them . When Rachel closed the door of the big house , taking in with her a moss-agate she did n't want , a moss-agate reduced to exactly its visible dimensions and attributes ? When Willis closed the front door of the Hazard house and began to whistle as he approached the corner into the unknown ? When Mr. Hazard stepped off the train from San Francisco , and Tim knew that his mother was dead ? Or did they reach even back of any of those to the moment when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the barrier , and saw Rachel alone in th sun in her yellow dress ? P340Or to the moment Tim was born ? Or to the moment Mrs. Hazardwas born ? You see the difficulty . It is equally great in the other direction . Would n't it be more accurate to say that the dark years ended when Tim and Rachel made that peculiarly disembodied but crucial pilgrimage up the enchanted mountain ? Or at the moment , after years of preoccupiedblindness , when Tim clearly saw Mary Turner as she was , standing at the edge of the Verdi road , nodding good-bye to him and wishing he would hurry ? Or when Rachel stood in the doorway of his bedroom in Carmel ? Or are they still going on at this moment , in Tim 's little daughter , who is already a fledgling in the magic wilderness , darting here , darting there , stopping abruptly to stare at whatever it may be , a trembling leaf , a cloud , a face , a strange pup , a thought ? When I try to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I finger dates , get out old letters from Tim , Mary , Lawrence , Helen , and even a couple from Rachel , remember incidents , places , conversations , bits of music , and yet remember also the tremendous gaps between these little realities , the gaps wherein the history really took place , it refuses more stubbornly than ever to hold its shape . At one moment it seems a few frantic , tormented weeks , at the next a lifetime , gray , thin and unpeopled . I can imagine the volumes of that lifetime set up before me , like thick , leather-bound law books , stamped across the backs with their dry titles : Vol . I , TIMOTHY HAZARD vs . MEMORY OF RACHEL WELLS ; Vol . II , MUSICAL DESIREOF TIMOTI lY HAZARD vs . IGNORANCE ; Vol . III , TIMOTHY 1 I AZA RI ) vs . THE ALMIGHTY DOLLAR ; Vol . IV , TI ll ? MORIBUND CITY vs . THE MAGIC WILDERNESS ; Vol . V , THE DREAMS OF TIMOTHY HAZARD vs . REALITY , etc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vol . XX , TIMOTHY HAZARD vs . TIMOTHY HAZARD . In order not to become lost in this dark library of the interior , in which Tim himself can no longer discover an accurate temporalsequence , I must resign myself to giving you a brief externalcatalogue and a handful of token scenes . They will serve , if you remember the comparable period of your own life , theP341terrible adolescence of the mind , which follows that of the body , the time during which reality gradually emerges streamingfrom the sea of dreams , but in a primal chaos , an awful birthdayof the world . Tim moved from the house by the race track into a secondfloorapartment on upper Sierra Street , the Peavine Quarter . He was still working at the River House , and by the measure of his past and of his small desire for possessions , he was wealthy . The apartment had two rooms and a bath . Tim rented a piano , bought a portable phonograph , and began to collect records , mostly of dance bands , but also Tschaikowsky , Debussy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old books with him , but the ones that shone from his hand and lay on the table by his bed , were new favorites , Edwin Arlington Robinson , the plays of Yeats and Synge , Hawthorne , Moby Dick , Keats , Shelley , Blake , Poe , a history of instruments and a treatise on symphonic composition . There was always a chess board , with the pieces set up , on the table in the living room . Tim and I were learning chess together , and once in a while Lawrence Black dropped in and played , though usually we had to go to his father 's house to see him , or to the narrow studio on the top floor of a downtown building , where he was doing scores of charcoal portraits , delicate as engravings and warm as paint , which were bringing many sitters to him , especially women in whom a certain faith of countenance had been shaken by the border years and the divorce court . Two of these portraits , one of a girl who was singing at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Tim 's living room , with a pale color print of The Last Supper and an enlarged , tinted photograph of Belle Isle in the Truckee , before it was a part of the park , both hung there by Mrs. Martin , the landlady . In the bedroom were three more of Mrs. Martin 's , a tinted Burne-Jones seeress , and two Sargent prophets , but there were also a panorama of Pyramid Lake in sunlight which streamed from afar out of other-worldly clouds , and Willis in jockey 's silks , his legs apart , his hands on his hips , the visor of his cap turned up , and a straw in his mouth . There was also theP342graduation photograph of Rachel in the gray dress , but it had no permanent place . Sometimes it was on the piano , sometimes on the desk by the west window , where the poplar leaves swam in the sunlight outside , and sometimes , if I arrived in the morning , before Tim was out of bed , I would find it on the bedside table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whence it regarded him with transitory blitheness over the foot of the bed . During the first part of this Sierra Street period Tim often talked about Rachel to me or to Lawrence , although never to both of us together . He assumed a detached and amused air of observing his own ridiculous antics of the past , but the ridicule was never aimed at Rachel , and he remembered her words , and amazingly trivial details of every incident , and sometimes these details led him into a mode of recollection that was not at all humorous . Then , if he observed his hearer 's uneasiness , he would stop abruptly , even in the middle of a sentence , and get up and go into the bedroom or the bathroom for a moment , and when he returned , start to talk about something else at once . Before he left Mrs. Martin 's he had altogether stopped talking about Rachel , and her picture would n't be in sight if he 'd known beforehand that one of us was coming . This change spread into other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a faint and puzzled melancholy , with brief periods of abstraction , from which he could easily be drawn into the eager , explorative talk natural to him , now deepened into a heavy mood . 1 le lost chess games through absent-mindedness . There were long spells when he sat by while Lawrence and I talked , and was not with us . It would take a direct question to awaken him , and then he would lose interest again shortly . Often we would find the room blue with smoke . There would be torn pieces of paper in the waste basket and , with the day nearly ended , he would still be in his pajamas and unshaven , playing his symphony records , especially the Pathetique , but not seeming to pay much attention to them either . He would be doing nothing , really , and yet we would have a feeling of intrudingwhich had never existed before . He would refuse to go on the long walks he and I had been taking together , walks  |p343which  had almost always broken his moods . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Black at the house in the Court Street Quarter . The drink and the quiet talk before dinner , the house itself , Mr. Black 's unfailing manner , seemed to restore him , and when Mr. Black had smoked his one afterdinnerpipe with us , bowed his farewell and his invitation to come again , and gone off quietly to read by himself or to completesome long document at the office , Tim would often argue and discuss and tell stories with his old spirit and imagination until it was time to go to work . Yet even at Black 's we 'd lose him sometimes . A look of great weariness would settle on him suddenlyat the table , as if he had come to a conclusion which made him hopeless . We would have to repeat remarks before he heard us , and often he would reply only with a wry smile of apology and a nod or a shake of the head . The end at Mrs. Martin 's came abruptly , though there may have been lead-ups I did n't know about . Tim and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Martin emerged from the shadows of the lower hall , and stood at the foot of the stairs , waiting for us . She tried to smile , and kept patting at her gray hair , which was in perfect order , as all parts of Mrs. Martin always were . " May I speak to you for a moment , Mr. Hazard ? " she asked . I went out onto the porch and waited . I could hear Mrs. Martin'svoice , though not what she said , but Tim 's short replies were clear . " All right , " he said when she stopped the first time . She went on again . She seemed to be pleading . " I ca n't do that , " Tim said . " It 's impossible . " She kept at him . " No , " he said once , and then , impatiently , " I know ; I know . " He came out . Mrs. Martin followed him to the door . " I 'm awfully sorry , Mr. Hazard , but you see how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's all right , " Tim said . When we were around the corner , he said , " Well , I have to move . "   " What 's wrong ? " " The noise I make , and coming in that time in the morning . " He walked silently for half a block . It was bothering him . " It 's not Mrs. Martin , " he said . " It 's the new roomers . Andersons . Mrs. Anderson 's home all day . Seems she has insomnia too , and just manages to get to sleep and then in I barge next door and go creeping about in my bare feet and reading in bed and raising all kinds of hell . " Oh , " he said , after a minute , " I suppose it is pretty bad . It 's hard to practice a trumpet quietly , you know , and I suppose it 's enough to drive anybody crazy to have to sit there and listen to the piano just being pecked at now and then all day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt that he had become offensiveto people and had been cast out . He felt that way too easily , and with increasing ease for a long time to come . The next day he moved , piano and all , into a single room over on Ralston and farther downtown . It was a nice room , though , on the ground floor in the back , with French windows looking out onto a lawn shaded by elms and cut off from the neighbors by a high hedge . It belonged to a middle-aged couple by the name of Allen . Mr. Allen was a traveling salesman , and was away for days at a time , and seldom home when Tim was workinganyway . Tim explained , almost angrily , the noise he would have to make , but Mrs. Allen assured him she would n't mind it . She 'd be glad of it , she said ; it would remind her there was somebody else in the house . She did n't like being alone in the house all the time . A week after Tim had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the River House , and refused to do any more arrangements for the band , and was fired . He seemed to be almostrelieved , at first . For a few weeks he spent all his time at Aliens ' , writing and tearing up , playing his records , brooding by the window , going to bed at three and four in the morning in a room blue with smoke . Lawrence and I could n't get him out . Then he had to move out of Aliens ' because the neighbors complained . He had taken to playing the piano tempestuously for an hour or two before he went to bed . It was the failure of  |p345his  writing gnawing at him all the time , and without the piano he could n't get to sleep . His movement toward the dead center continued at an acceleratedpace , a circular movement , a movement like that of a leaf in a whirlpool . He took an apartment on lower Court , but had to let it go because it was too expensive , and he was playing only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gloomy , downstairs room in one of the old houses on Mill Street , like the house where Marjory I laic and her mother had lived . He had to leave there too , and for a while he let his piano go , and slept in a small hotel room on lower Sierra Street . Then he got in with the band at the Cloudland Ballroom , the big public dance hall by the tracks , and moved into a little house by himself , a paintless place with a broken picket fence , on Universityabove Fourth . He missed too many practices of the band . He would n't mean to miss them . He would be writing ; it would seem to be going . The exaltation would rise in him . Those were the moments that mattered . Just a little more and it could n't escape him . It always did escape him , though , and when he had torn up the score or the pages of verse , the practicewould be over . Cloudland let him go too . Then it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the little house into the single rooms once more , often rooms where he could n't keep a piano . It was Rob Gleaman who got Tim into the job he held longest . He met Rob in the Alfalfa Club , a place with a back room , and a door on Douglas Alley . Tim had begun to go there often . I le was n't drinking heavily ; he did n't have money enough to do that , for one thing , and for another , he was fighting his troubles , his self-doubts . He went to the Alfalfa Club to sit there over a beer and fight with himself . Mentally he had little mercy for anything in the world then , but least of all for himself . He 'd make a beer last an hour while he sat there fighting . Sometimes he 'd get another beer and sit there for another hour . Every once in a while he 'd get up and put a nickel in the juke box , always picking the smooth , sweet stuff , with bad lyrics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most . Then he 'd sit there lis-P346tening to it , and believing he heard his own habits in it everywhere . He 'd remember everything he had tried to write seriously , tried to make say something , all the piano studies , a couple of violin concertos , the songs , the three abandoned attemptsat the symphony of leaves , which would n't come whole , which always died in the second theme , the Court Street , WingfieldPark theme , and suddenly his stomach would flop over and sink away toward the bottom of everything , and he would want to put his head down on his arms and weep . He would n't do it , though , for fear somebody would think he was drunk and could n't hold himself together . He 'd sit upright , looking ahead of him , holding his cigarette in one hand and his beer glass in the other , and believe that he saw nothing in any of that music that had even a promise of being his own . He 'd tell himself that if he ever wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studious , correct stuff , the music of a scholar . He mocked himself for refusing to write for the dance bands , and then going on living by them anyway . He told himself that if he was even honest he would admit that all he was good for was slick arrangements , and would go back to work at them and at playing a good horn . Then he would remember Rachel , and the talking too much and the moss-agate and the despair would spread out into everything , the smallness , the helplessness of mankind , the cruel , worse than animal history it had made for itself with murder and selfishness and stupid prejudice . Everything he was reading then , Darwin , Huxley , Mill , Adam Smith , Bertrand Russell , Jeffers , Marx , O'Neill , Hardy , Flaubert , Dostoievsky , the thinkers who could bear his test of reality , would seem to bear out his despair , and the reason of the scientists and the solitaryheroism of Jeffers and the social heroism of Russell , would seem to him futile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flood by himself . The same futility would wash over the music he was admiring then , Bach , Mozart , Ravel , Stravinsky . He got into the habit of going to the Alfalfa Club when he fell into one of these sieges , because there he was anonymous . A shabby man was natural there . Most of the customers were miners and lumberjacks , cowboys and railroad section hands , 346P347old or out of work or down on their luck or all three . They had troubles enough of their own . He was sitting in the Alfalfa Club one afternoon , when Rob Gleaman came in and sat down opposite him and told him the Northern Lights was looking for a horn , and that he 'd put in a word for Tim with the manager . Rob nearly pushed him into going up there ; it was only a couple of doors along the block and up a narrow , rattly flight of stairs . It was n't quite like playingat the Stockade , on the Line itself , but it was the next thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made their dates . It was a big , bare room , like a gymnasium , with a glaring light . The band was bad , and five pieces , and happy the way it was . There was n't much money to be made either , just what the kitty took , but at least it was fairly regular , and nobody cared if he was late or a little off form , so he stayed . I lc would bc there most nights from eight or nine in the evening until the first daylight showed in the three windows high off the floor on the east side . He even started doing arrangements for the band , and trying to pick it up , but the men were n't interested . Then it became like a drug , a habit , just going there and sitting and playing mechanically through the hours . He had short spells of trying to cook up dance numbers of his own , transcribing them carefully and sending them out to publishers . They all came back . I suspect that he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the songs he wrote were satires , but Tim says it was accidental if they were , that he was really trying to write the stuff , and could n't . He met some old friends of his at the Northern Lights , saw them almost everynight , Lucyand Dorothyand Harold Ashby . I le says that now the memory of them makes him very glad that he was a dreamy child , content with his visions and the adoration of Mary . At that time , though , they added to his feeling of doom in the seed . They were further proofs of futility , each of them the final product , already , of his grammar-school promise . Lucy was all right ; Lucy could still take it or leave it , and she was still clean , sharp , cheerful and witty . Lucy was ' probably a good friend to a lot of lonely men . But Dorothy and P348Harold were also still themselves , only more so , and that was different . It was n't hard now to believe the stories Harold had told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gladys was n't there . Gladys , Lucy said , was already dead of the sickness , as Lucy called it , still using a gentle vocabulary for Tim . Yet , even at this time , it was n't all darkness in Tim . There was something which kept him going , call it what you want , the memory of Rachel , the adoration of Mary , the St. Francis hope , the gift of Mrs. Hazard , the sound of the poplars outside the window of the house by the race track . There is one picture which stays with me , that seems to mean all this . While Tim was working at the Northern Lights , he made his last move toward the center of the city . He took a topfloorroom in an office building on East Second , right across from the Orient , a place where he liked to eat . He got a lot of food for a few cents there , and he liked Ling Choy , the cheerful , heavy man who ran the place , and he enjoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like drinking in a long rest . Ling Choy always sat on a high stool between his cash register and the front window , and ' rim could look down from his own window and see the massive head and shoulders of Ling Choy above the half curtain on its brass rod . " Tim 's room had belonged to an eccentriclawyer , who in his last years had never wanted to leave the building where his office was . It had a bathroom , and was the only living quarters in the whole building , all the other windowshaving gilt names on them , lawyers , mining companies , agencies . In fact ' T'int 's windows still had the dead lawyer 's name on them . I lc would always see it there , backside to , with the sunlight darkening it , when he woke in the morning . The room was high , and had remnants of the mining-boom kind of splendor , nine-foot doors and windows , a tin ceiling pressed into birds of paradise and a worn , gray carpet that covered the whole floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high , armorial head , and the only closet was a huge clothes press against one wall . It was a good room for what Tim wanted ; nobody caret how much noise he made there , or when . He could P349self to sleep with a trumpet if he wanted to , or maul a piano for hours , any hours . There was no one else in the building from six in the afternoon until nine in the morning , and that part of town was awake and noisy all night anyway . Tim could n't affordthe room , but he could afford still less not to have it , so he managed to keep it paid for . He kept it for a long time , until well after he was out of his worst period . Ile loved it , in the way Lawrence , later on , got to love one particular bedroom in an old hotel in Austin . It was his cave , his refuge , almost his world . His clothes were reduced to old sweaters and slacks , except one dark suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one meal a day on an electric plate in the room , and sometimes ate another at the Orient or the Waffle Shop or had a sandwich and a beer at Benner 's . There were even times when he did n't buy any records and pinched out and saved his cigarette butts . The room was the thing he could n't give up . It was as monastic as Tim could wish , as far as its contents were concerned , but only once in a while , in a spasm , did it attain the kind of order which had once mattered to him . Most of the time his clothes would be out on the chairs and over the foot of the bed , the bed would be unmade , tin-can lids full of cigarette butts would be everywhere , crumpled pages of scores and of notes or retorts on his reading would be strewn around the table , and his breakfast dishes , still with egg or a little milk or coffee in them , would stand on the window sill all day . There would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corners . For a time the only extraneous thing in the room was that photograph of Eileen Connor on the piano . Toward he end of his worst period , there was one other decoration , the use to a kind of Indian chant he had written , called Prayerr the Evil Days . It was printed out in ink on a big , raggedecc of brown wrapping paper and pasted up on the wall over is bed with adhesive tape . On days when not even the hopefulginnings came , when the score of the fifth try at the tremlingleaves was tied up and thrown in a corner , the top page usty and yellowing , and Tim would stop work after only aw minutes , and then sit there for hours , slumped down in his P350chair , staring at nothing , and finally , without shaving or combinghis hair , put on his overcoat , and turn up the collar , and go out and walk for more hours , slow and hunched as an old man , or go up to the Alfalfa Club and sit with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he avoided even Lawrence and Helen and me , he used this prayer . At first he read it , word for word , out loud , but when he found that he 'd memorized it , he began to just touch it , look at it and touch it , like a Tibetan priest using a prayer wheel , and let that do , not even trying for the completedmood . Nevertheless , that prayer shows a little of what I mean , the something that did n't give up . I stand on the mountain in the dry wind blowing . My feet on the mountain burn ; my eyes burn beholding in the valley of my soul , desolation , in the hills of my mind no springs. 1 am silent . I hearThe rabbit of my heart make his last kick . Ayee , god of life , god of the deep night , Stars are the fires of your people ; they are many . Oh , Sun , riding over the day , Moon that walks by herself , making a long song of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not flutter . Raise the tent of clouds over my desert ; Open my tent of clouds upon the west . Ayee , Sun , stand in its peak like a moon , Teach lightning to dance where the white dusts walk . Make my ears happy with rain . Then are the good days . The grass comes back in the valley , There is a noise of happy water in the hills , On the bank of the full river the willow makes green smokeAnd the wild duck comes home . P351Tim 's talk with Lawrence and Helen and me showed what was still alive too . It was almost impossible to get him to go out anywhere now , except to Lawrence 's cabin in the Peavine Quarter . We had to come to the room to see him , even Lawrence , who also preferred to stay with his own gods . He would n't play chess with us at all . Sometimes he 'd play records , and prowl about softly in his socks . Sometimes he 'd lie flat on the floor , staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk over him . But once in a while , perhaps by praising Wagner , or the old love , Tschaikowsky , we 'd get him started . Then he was magnificent , a natural phenomenon , like a volcano in eruption . Ile would go on for an hour or more , playing bits on records and on the piano , singing and whistling other bits , stalking about , sitting down , getting up , discovering , discovering all the time , illustratingabundantly , with an heroic disregard for fact or authority . When he was in full flow , he would keep addressinge , sharply , with a thin and wicked pronunciation , as " My car Professor Clark , " or " You , Master Footnote , " and Lawnceas " Listen , St. Francis , " or " My good Mahatma Aquinas. " awrence seldom replied to him , but sat there , thin , dark , quiet , perceptive , taking in the whole show with an air of amused ( order which encouraged it , viewing it as the tremendous creative relief it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give and take , with exact and colorfulrages that often made me feel that my own mind was work-g very shoddily . He liked best to let a whole point rest on a Ingle , short parable , usually remodeled out of his own expel-ice . I , on the other hand , was the antagonist . I argued . And itas true that if I meanly pounced upon an error of fact , a elate , title , I could often explode a whole structure . " All , Doctor2 , " Tim would say , but then his flow would fall off . After a , he would be sitting there silent , with the shadows of selfdoubtchasing each other behind his eyes . It was n't that theet mattered . It was often of no real importance . But Timmid feel it , not as an argument , but as a blow against himself , revelation of his pretense , a curt suggestion of scorn on myrt , although it never was that , He would feel that this scornP352was justified , and all his fine , exploratory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the instead-of talk . I learned not to do that . The real point is that the unquenchable something stayed alive in those talks . It showed a little in his books , too . No matter what direction he turned in his quest for the veritable shape of his new world , a world still lifting from the waters , there would be among that clutter of books , astronomy , biology , political science , history , that one little collection of men to whom nature , no matter what shape they gave its god , no matter how they saw men against it , was still mysterious , beautiful , exciting , enough : W. H. Hudson , Tomlinson 's Sea and the Jungle , John Muir , Joseph Conrad . Tim would never go outside the city with us during this time . I suspect that he felt like a sinful priest , unfit to enter his chosen places , but often we could rouse him with talk about those places , about Pyramid , Death Valley , Tahoe , the Black Rock , the Toyabes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even in the darkest manifestations of the depths there was touch of this something , call it romanticism if you want , call i youth , call it the memory and the hope of the never-was . What ever you call it , it was there , and it was the saving touch . Tim had a couple of dreams that may well have marked h ' lowest reach . I would never have known about them , save th he made them both into music , which shows you what I mca He made them into piano studies which had a haunting , unsatisfying , memorable suggestion of wanting to be more , orchestra pieces , perhaps . He was playing one of them when I came up t his room one afternoon . I asked for it again , and then he play me the other also . Finally he let me read the dreams which ha started them . The dreams had impressed him tremendously , t more so in that they had been repeated , in exact detail , as far he could remember . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lived more in its aura than in Reno . He had written the out very carefully , some twenty pages for the two of the ' When this was done , they had begun to make their own music , The Empty City Prelude and The White Horse Prelude , he hadP353called them . They speak for themselves of his loneliness , at least . In the first dream he believed that he was standing on the very peak of a high mountain in a black night . He believed the mountainwas Mt . Rose , though he could n't see its shape , or even a star . He could see only a single faint light , far below him . He was on skis . He was drawn to this light , and fled down toward it , only to find that it was a lantern overhanging a tremendous precipice . He leapt out into the emptiness and , after the terrible fall , found himself walking in a city below . The city seemed to be a fantastic composite of Reno and his reading-imagination of Venice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was always about to meet someone or come upon a place which was unquestionably familiar , but at last he realized that he was the only person in the city , and that its looming walls and flying wet-walks were without doors or windows . Then he went c i own the same street , hoping for something beyond a turnhich never came , until the dream winked out . In the other dream , the one I first heard him playing , he was i ' unted upon a white horse , and brandishing a horseshoe with green ribbon on it . He rode for miles over an empty , mouninouslandscape , always about to become familiar . He changed ings , was now an oaf on a cumbersome plow-horse , now a liant with a mission , upon a splendid charger . Then , in the ntral movement , he was looking for someone whom he lovedy dearly . This someone was hidden or imprisoned in a vast ilding with marble pillars , numbered doors and furniture in iped dust covers . He did n't know who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't find him , the person was lost . Enemies om he never quite saw multiplied behind the doors and pillars he explored , yet , sweating and frightened , he went into every mi . Then , all at once , he knew that the person was already , and made his escape . At last he was riding back over the same mountain , upon the same horse . The sun was coining up , d he was triumphant , although he did not know why . The strongest fort for Tim against the empty city and the empty house , the strongest fort for all of us , for that matter , was Lawrence 's cabin on the alley in the Peavine Quarter . LawrenceP354and Helen had been married for more than a year when they moved up there . Tim and I had n't even known what was going on at first . Lawrence gradually dropped out of our ken . When we went up to the studio , there would be a BACK TO-M ORROW sign on the door . When we called his father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would tell us softly that he would be busy that afternoon , and would see us in a day or two . We merely caught glimpses of him afar , as it were , as he disappeared through strange doors . Then , one night when we were eating at Ling Choy 's , he appeared in the world again , and Helen was with him . He introduced her as Mrs. Aikens , and they sat in the booth with us , and we talked and liked her . We were gaining a member , not losing one . They had been out at Pyramid all day , exploring among the needles at the north end , and they were dried out and scorched . Helen kept talking about the light and the bareness , trying to find a way to tell us what it did to her . She had a deep , husky voice , with a strong kind of haste or excitement behind it , a permanent quality , which had nothing more to do with her subject than her hair did , or her hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong hands which she seemed to curb from constant gesturing by will alone . Shwas all of a piece in this impression , as far as that goes , the energy of her beautiful body , very upright on the bench , the movement and shining and interest of her big eyes , the tipped-up nose , the brown , sculptured face , the wide mouth , curved down at the ends , so that when she was not speaking it seemed quietly set to contain some sadness of her own . She spoke quickly , but her mind ran far ahead of her words , and she was impatient about finishing thoughts . You felt that what she wanted to do was run , jump , shout , get her hands . on the things she talked about . She propelled incomplete sentences at us , shooting them just far enough for us to get the drift and then leaving us to finish them , or suggesting the rest with a gesture or a blanket expression . We understood what she meant this time . She was a dazed neophyte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . That was test enough , if one had been able to think of making a test with Helen in front of him . P355She and Lawrence were married a few weeks later , and disappeared in the old Cadillac into the wilderness of desert and mountains and mining camps for another month . Then they lived at Black 's until Mr. Black retired and went down to the coast , when the gatherings at the cabin began . We were often together up there in the late afternoons , and sometimes for supper . Helen would scuff about in the dark , little kitchen in her flopping sandals , humming or singing bits of tunes which were never finished either . " Through the screen door , and out beyond the vine-covered porch , the sunlight would lie on the back fences and the dusty alley , and the shadows would lengthen across it . We would be in the main room , Lawrence and Tim and I , but even through her pots and fans and her humming , Helen would join in our conversation . Lawrence would show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shout it . He was at a crossroad too . He saw behind him miles of these delicate charcoal women , and he suspected them of a fam-y likeness and of kinship to the camera . More and more often is subjects were finding signs on the studio door , " Out until me ungodly hour , " or " Gone to find a man , " or , if he had own them longer , " Sorry . Lawrence . " He was beginning to II these stolen hours by walking Commercial Row and Lake treet , looking for old , weather-beaten and troubled faces . But en these studies were only a kind of temporizing with a grow-g discontent . In his studio and in the cabin appeared more and re notebook sketches by Leonardo and Rembrandt , and for plates of paintings by El Greco and Michelangelo , or of Tian primitives , which he pored over , delighting in their pure ! or , loaded pattern and childlike purpose . Blake 's Job , a huge , t-stamped volume , was almost always open beside his bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious era was tieing to him . Simple , mutable figures for design , like his fish , crested him far more than portraits . He was doing hundreds quick , flowing sketches with brush and pencil , bits of anything , a hand , the line of a hill and trees , the corner of a room , bile , faceless figures ; he was yearning after a freedom of d and a simplicity of intent which his complex nature madeP356difficult . He was exploring paints and colored chalks , mixing his own colors , concocting new binders and driers , inventing new , quick ways to approximate the effect of an engraving or a wood cut . He was on the verge of a period of rich , unlivable revolt . We knew all this ; we knew what he thought of the portraits . He would set this one up on a chair and let us look at it . I lc would move softly , carrying the picture by its edges between his long hands , and set it up as if it were a sacred object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an inalienable trait , like his quiet speech and detached courtesy , and it was aimed at leaving us to look at the picture as if he were n't there , or had n't made it . When it was set up , he would smile at us , and return without a word to the low stool and table where he was trying some new trick of simplicity with figures of turtles or fish . His thin back , in its dark flannel shirt , would be toward us , roundsintently over his moving hands . He would disown the pictur and we would stand there looking at it . The steaks would hiss in the kitchen as Helen flipped the over , and their smell would come to us , with the smell of th onion rings she was throwing in with them . Tim and I would l holding tall , yellow beers . Another beer would stand upon th table by Lawrence 's elbow . Jewels of sunlight would glea into the room through the vines over the window , which mad a cool , green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the table or beside Lawrence 's Morris chair . The bac of Lawrence 's few books would shine softly out of the un painted case . Down the alley there would be the sounds of chi dren 's voices in last games before supper . Down the alley , ovc the whole quarter , strong in the cabin , was the blessing Peavine . Under his thoughts about the picture , Tim would feel t kindness of the small west room , where he sometimes slept . ' I ' h walls of that room were the earth color of an old water oil There was one window , which opened into the yard with the one aspen and the high , board fence . There was a cot , a lout , table beside it for a book , and on the wall one picture ofP357Lawrence 's , not one he would sell , but one in which he was tryingfor something . Tim loved that room . When he slept in it , he always woke up feeling at home , and as if he were about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the secret . In the kitchen the plates would rattle , and Helen would call , " Did you ever see so many rubber checks in one pair of eyes , Tim ? Lawrence is crazy . He thinks  --  but then , that kind . You know . " Then the talk would go on while they sat in the green room , eating their steak and onions and hard rolls , and drinking their beer . Tim would come out easily , there in the cabin . Almost at once he would begin to look rested and happier , as if being there and with us was enough , and all the rest could be put away for the time being . He would talk with great energy , branching from idea to idea , not arguing , never even ironical . He would improvise for us on the violin or on the harmonica Lawrence kept by his bed . The bed , with a bright cloth over it , was a couch at these meetings . Helen would sit on it , her back very straight up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her bright bracelets would click sharply as she gestured . There was a strong , undeclared love dwelling there among us . Then it would be getting near nine o'clock , and Tim would have to go . And at four or five in the morning , tired but sleepless , he would go back to the room with the lawyer 's name backwards on the window . Now that you know a little of what it was like in that room , and of what Tim took into it with him , you can see the picture I mentioned , the one that might represent the whole period . I was standing on the corner of Second and Center , waiting for the light to change , so I could cross to Tim 's building . It was late in the afternoon of a day in July . It had been one of those hot , glittering days , with a strong wind in the afternoon . Now the wind had died , and left a coolness and a smell from the mountains in the city . The sunlight was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It gleamed and burned on the windows , and flashed on the car tops . It picked out all the P358signs hanging over the sidewalks with a stereopticon clarity . Life was picking up . People were hurrying home from work , talking and laughing . The summer night was before them . The doors of the clubs on Center Street opened and closed , letting out the click of the games , the babel of voices and the beginnings of dinner music , and closing them in again . I looked up and saw Tim leaning on the ledge of his open window . His shirt sleeves were rolled up and his collar was open . He was leaning out far enough so that the sun concentrated on him , as it did on the signs . He was very bony and white from his night work and the long case of Tim Hazard vs . Tiny Hazard . His hair was at the end of a period of neglect , and must have been raked frequently in recent torment , for it curled out in an immense confusion which made his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , marking his place with a forefinger , he held a slim , black-covered volume . Even at that distance I guessed that it was Eliot 's The Waste Land . For a long time it , and many of the references that had to go with it , had been lying around in " Kim 's room , with markers in them . The room behind Tim was like a black cavern , like the vestibuleto miles of caverns , going in and in . On the windows all about him shone the gilded signs . On the sidewalk below , a man was talking to a woman . The man was wearing a wrinkled suit , and his hair and tic were disordered . His body was swaying jerkily through a small ellipse , and although I could n't hear him through the traffic and the voices and the scuffing of feet around me , I could see that he was arguing vehemently . He was jerking his hands at the woman , and then standing with them wide apart , asking why . The woman was wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-heeled , silver sandals . Her silver flashed sometimes in the sunlight , and sometimes glowed softly and turned gold . She was hugging herself with both arms , very white arms , and not answering the man , and not looking at him , but always at one spot in the street , across which the traffic passed unnoticed . An old policeman was standing on the corner and watching them without interest . He was shaped like a pear from his head to his hips , and his legs P359were short and bowed . The man and the woman and the policemanall looked very tired , but it was impossible to tell whether the man was arguing about something tragically important or about where they should get the next drink . But Tim was n't watching the confusion of the crossing , or the three figures below him . The only things he could have seen , leaning out and staring east , as he was , were the trees beyond the middle of the city , and , back of them , the Virginia Mountains glowing in the sunset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , I knew I was right , for I could hear him softly whistling the trail song from the Grand Canyon Suite . When I knocked and he said , " Come in , " his voice was very quiet . Prelude to the Moun-tainTHE paper prayer hung on the wall of Tim 's room for two years , long past the time when it served even as a reminding ritual . Then , on an afternoon in August of the second year , a touch of the magic wilderness erased it , the finger of God , you blight call it , which eventually rubs out all it writes , to make spice for new versions . Tim , nearly incorporeal after a long meditation at the AlfalfaClub , and without any desire except for sleep , was driftingout of Douglas Alley onto Virginia Street . He paused formoment , dazed by the motion and summer glitter in the street , nd by the sudden buffeting of a wind , full of the smells of desert dust and hot pavement . He did n't feel hungry , lout he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he decided to go n up the alley and get a glass of milk and a sandwich at Benner'sfore he went back to his room . He crossed the . street slowly , d was about to enter the alley on the other side , when the nice spoke which echoed far along familiar corridors of his mind .   " Hello there , Tim Hazard , " said the voice . He was not at once seized by vertigo and breathlessness . I It was merely confused because it seemed , for the moment , that he was leading someone else 's existence , and that when he shed the error , he would go home to the house by the race track , and Willis would come vaulting down the stairs on his way to somewhere else , shouting , " Hiya , bum ? " as he shot past , and i'Irs . Hazard would come to the kitchen door and say , " Hello , son . Home already ? " This instant of sweet and painful youngnesspassed , but it had broken his daze . Like one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the too familiar , he became clearly aware of telephone poles , ash cans and fierce sunlight upon dirty bricks in the alley before him , and at the same time of his work shirt and frayed trousers and unshaven face , and the overcoat which he put on whenever he left his room now , regardless of the temperature , as armor against the world . Ile resisted the impulse to feel his face , and keeping both hands in his pockets , turned and looked at her . How much she appeared the same as ever , standing there smiling at him , her arms full of bundles and the wind whipping her skirt , and yet there was a difference which he recognized at once . This was a woman 's face , not a girl 's , from which she regardedhim evenly and humorously . Her smile did n't wink out at once , as if it had been a convulsive effort , but lingered , awaitinghis recognition and reply . The long battle of Rachel vs . Rachel was over and won , or at least well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reticence of humbleness and inexperience . There passed through his mind , rapidly and without sequence , things he had heard or imagined about her in this time she had been away , the malicious hints of Pauline Chester , the account by better friends who said she had almost killed herself over a broken love affair in college , and that her mother had taken her to Europe , pictures of her moving in settings which his own mind had constructed from , say , Herodotus and Proust , Synge and Homer and Debussy , the Italian primitives and the National Geographic . He advanced , watching her face , until he might have touched her .   " Hello , Rachel , " he said . " How are you ? " he asked . " I 'm fine , " she said , and then , " How are you ? " as if that were the question which really needed answering . " I 'm fine too , " he said , " only I guess I need a shave pretty badly , " and finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This wind , " Rachel said , turning her head from it . " Are you very busy , Tim ? " " No , " he said . It was a silly question , when everything else in the world had receded behind her and become a trick animatedbackdrop , but it was also an exciting question . " Then you 're just the person I 'm looking for , " she said , and began to walk north . He walked beside her , taking some of the bundles from her arms . Together they bowed into the wind ; together they bowed their heads to the dust . " The car is up around the corner , " she said . The car was a roadster with the top down , though not a blue one , but dark maroon . Rachel dumped her bundles into the space behind the seat , opened the door and slipped in under the wheel . Tim put his bundles with hers and hesitated , one foot on the running board , and looked at her . A long cattle train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossings . The patient , white faces of the cattle stared out in rows from behind the slats which made shadows on them . The crossing bells clinked thinly in the wind , and the traffic piled up at the striped gates . Rachel made a face about the noise . " Really not busy , Tim ? " she shouted . He shook his head . " Work at night , " he shouted . She patted the seat beside her , and with his heart suddenly playing at double tempo , he went around and climbed in . She glanced back , and saw that she would have to wait until the traffic on Virginia and Sierra opened the street , and then looked at him , smiling with that new easiness , but also with a glint of enigmatic malice in her eyes . " For a minute , " she shouted , " I thought you would n't recognizeme ; I thought you were going right on by without even saying hello . " A light , continuous laughter , not about anything funny , butP362about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the moment he had begun to walk beside her . Now it nearly broke out of him in a shout . Not recognize her ? Had not his deafened ears , at the first syllable spoken in her voice , opened and heard the wind roaring in the trees of Reno ? Had not his blinded eyes , in the same instant , been unsealed to the desolate beauty of sunlight upon brick walls grimy with life of which he knew nothing ? Was n't he , here , beside her , for the first time in ages , cradled in the hand of God ? There was also something new in this meeting . He was still Tim Hazard ; he was n't erased by her presence . He was not sure that this was a gain , but his instinct was to defend it . He must watch his words ; he must watch his thoughts . A single familiar phrase , one of his old openings , one of his still more habitual thoughts about her , which seemed now just a saving trifle false to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release the flood again . " You surprised me , " he shouted . " I had n't thought of you as any nearer than the Appian Way . I lost my bearings for a moment . " She laughed . The laughter , like the smile , was easier . She bent over a little , but did n't seem to undergo a spasm . The rumbling of the cattle train diminished , and the roadster stopped quivering from its weight . The caboose passed over the Sierra Street crossing and came by them , bearing upon its rear platform a man who stood with one foot up on the rail , and picked his teeth , and regarded Commercial Row with the detachment of one who has seen so many railroad streets roll past without affecting his snug world that he no longer quite believes in any of them . The striped gates rose slowly and hung pointing up into the deep-blue , windy sky . The two tides of cars , sparkling and flashing , began to pass each other on the crossing .. " I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and I want a bodyguard against ghosts . " " I 'm better at raising them , " Tim said , " but maybe my familiarpresence will keep them reasonable . " Rachel laughed again . P363When they were moving in the traffic , Tim asked , " You goingto stay at the house ? " " No . I just want to get a few things . I 'm staying with Fay and her husband . " He let the roadster go a block before he asked , " Are you going to be here long ? " Rachel shook her head , lifting herself on the wheel , reaching for the gas like a ballet dancer . " Only a day or two , I 'm afraid . I have to be back at work next Monday . " " What kind of work are you doing ? " " Social service ; San Francisco . Mother and I have an apartmenttogether . " Only a day or two , he thought . She still had the power to age the world with a few words , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet an antique splendor . Nonetheless , he felt no urge to self-annihilation . He was merely touched by melancholy . They turned onto the drive between the big lawns under trees . The place seemed very old and somewhat strange , as if it had emerged from a hearsay memory rather than a personal one . l , he caretaker had neglected it for more pressing duties around ) ccupied homes . The grass was long , the gravel in the drive was worn through to hard earth in many places , and vines climbed over the walls and roof of the house , and hung from the top of the porte-cochere and from the eaves and across shuttered windows . It was hard to turn the key in the lock of the front door . Inside , the house was cool , musty and dim . The only light seeped in through cracks in the shutters , or around drawn curtains . The floors were bare , and the furniture was shrouded in striped dust covers , which seemed to Tim ominously significant , though he could n't , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray dust had settled everywhere , dimming such glints on banisters and woodwork as the rays of light could make . Rachel had entered quickly , briskly , as if she meant to accomplish her errand in a minute or two and be gone without anot her thought , hut before she reached the middle of the hall , she was walking Wore slowly , and at the foot of the stairs she stopped and lookedP364about . Her chin came up . Gradually her face assumed the expression of the little soldier . It was as if all the years between had dropped away when she entered . She spoke as she had al ways spoken when she looked like that , making an effort to speak at all , and not saying what she was thinking . " Let in some light in the living room , will you , please , Tim ? It 's so gloomy in here . There are no shutters on the big window . " " Sure , " he said , but waited , watching her . She ran up to the first landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a few minutes , if I can remember , " and then ran on up . When she disappeared above , he felt as he had always felt in a strange place with her , that he should n't let her out of his sight for fear something would happen to her . Or was it that when she went out of sight , it seemed that nothing of importance could ever happen to him again ? No , those were the notions he must pinch off when they started . He went into the living room , his steps echoing , and let up the shade from the big , west window . It was a fine window , a single , huge sheet of plate glass . He remembered how , when you sat back in the room , away from this window , it made a frame for Mt . Rose and her foothills . He thought of the mountainas he had often seen it through that window , snow-covered , austere and so lofty in the sunlight in the blue sky that it seemed to send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sensation of lost time and changed self , which had been in abeyance since the moment Rachel had spoken to him at the corner of the alley , returned overwhelmingly when he let up the shade , for the window was dusty and stained , and vines hung down across it outside , in a leafy valance and a drape along one side . A single , hanging tendril danced in the wind in the center . He had to stoop to see the mountain , and then the mountain was not white and austere , vaulting up into the blue , but brown and dulled , a great weight sinking wearily into the dark thunderheads of its foothills . The only snow was the tiny patch on the north side , just below the summit . He turned back into the room , and it appeared even more dead and empty with the light in it than it P365had before . Looking at the furniture in the striped dust covers , he now remembered what he had n't been able to remember in the hall , that the furniture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so fearfully hunted for someone in the White Horse dream . He shrugged his shoulders as if to throw off the weakening memory , but already it seemed to him that Rachel had been upstairs for hours . He stood still in the middle of the room , listening , but heard only the creaking of the house when the wind leaned on it , and the rushing of the trees outside , and the tapping of the vines against windows and shutters . An unreasonablefear that something had really happened to Rachel upstairs , the ghost of a belief that he would search this house through also , door by door , with growing dread , and she would not be in it , came over him . He crossed to the piano and turned the dust-cover back . The piano was n't locked . He opened it , and passed his fingers idly up the keys in a run and a series of light chords . It was n't badly out of tune . There was only the slightest ringing of the overtones . He took off his coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the piano . He was still thinking about the house , and he let his hands play whatever they worked into . The touch of the keys was all he wanted , something going on , a link with reality . It had always seemed to him that this house was an unhappy one , that Rachel 's battle with the world had been , in part , an extension of her life in the house , in much the same way that the old house on Mill Street had maintained a private aura about Marjory I-tale , wherever she went ; or did he only believe that he had always felt this , having constructed the past after Rachel had gone and her father and mother had been divorced ? No , it was n't entirely an after-the-fact reconstruction . It must have been an unhappy house . He had never known Mr. Wells , even to the extent that a boy in his teens may know a man in his forties , but he had been sure of that one thing , that Mr. Wells was n't happy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , excepting those moments which did n't prove anything , when he had stopped to leave Rachel at a party or to pick her up at the tennis courts , or was seen passing through the door that led P366to the gloomy staircase in the building where he had his law offices , or entertaining clients at one of the clubs . Those four or five times , Tim had been sitting in the hall , waiting for Rachel , and Mr. Wells had come out of the dining room and through the living room and the hall , walking slowly , with his hands iii his pockets , his gaze on the floor and a weary stoop to his shoulders , and thinking to the point of detachment from his sur roundings , worrying , it had seemed to Tim . His face had been unhappy and absent-minded . When Tim had stood up to greet him , Mr. Wells had always appeared faintly surprised to discoverhim there . Each time he had glanced at Tim , not really seeing him , nodded , murmured , " Good evening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairs or into the study at the other end of the hall . Tim had caught a glimpse of the study as Mr. Wells had opened the door , a glimpse of deep rugs , a big , leather chair with a table and lamp beside it , the corner of a gray-stone fireplace with a stand of brass-handled fire irons , and filled bookshelves reaching to the ceiling . Then Mr. Wells had closed himself in quietly . That was all , really , that he knew about Mr. Wells . Yet Mr. Wells must have been an unhappy man . I le had been married to Rachel 's mother , and even then , whatever the causes , he had known he was losing her . Rachel and her mother were very much alike . It would have been impossible , then , for any man who had lived with Mrs. Wells all those years not to have loved her almost unbearably . Tim grinned a little , and shook his head , as if arguing with himself , as he realized how that conclusion would have struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard it about people he had never seen . Nevertheless , that was the way he felt about it . He rememberedMrs . Wells , with a smile like Rachel 's smile now , being very kind and friendly with him while he waited , asking him into the living room when the family dinner was done , or coming to sit with him in the hall while the sounds of silver and china and quiet voices were still going on beyond the opened double doors , making him feel more welcome than Rachel ever had , asking him about his studies , his music , his tennis , probably , as he saw it now , feeling sorry for him because she could see , likeP367reading a map , the state he was in about Rachel , and knew , from a thousand little confidences with her daughter , how foolish and useless it was . How many times , he wondered , making fun of himself with short , sardonic turns and dancing but minor ripples on the piano , but nonetheless not wholly escaping the mortifying unhappiness such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventeen , how many times had Rachel returnedfrom dates with him , and in the security of her home , the relief at having escaped him , said passionately , the little fury ( lancing in her eyes , " Oh , that Tim Hazard , " or stronger things of the same import ? It had n't been altogether pity , though . Mrs. Wells had really liked him , he thought . I lc had always , rather ridiculously , he saw now , felt more hopeful about his chances with Rachel after he had talked with Mrs. Wells , probably becauseshe and Rachel were so much alike that it seemed that everything Mrs. Wells thought and felt might some time be what Rachel thought and felt , if it were n't already something they shared . He thought again of Rachel and Mrs.Wells journeying about Europe and the Mediterranean together , Rachel blind and shaken and despairing , Mrs. Wells with her older sorrow , her much longer , if now less passionate , memories and defeated hopes . Emerson said you found only what you took with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe he and Emerson were both wrong . He had never gone anywhere where people and surroundings were really strange , and neither had Emerson , untilhe was too set in his habits to admit new thoughts or emotions except as slight , transient and distasteful . The thought of Emerson brought him to the surface for a moment , and he noticed what he had been playing , a medley of fragments from music he had scarcely thought of for a long time , Mozart , Brahms , Debussy , Chopin , songs of ( ; ricg and Bach . Now he was playing Footsteps in the Snow . I le delibertclyshaped it a little more softly and distinctly . I Iad n't he often known himself , when he did break away ' , from his room and from the city to some place like Pyramid or the little lake under Mt . Rose , feeling dead , feeling that there367P368was nothing left in him , to find , after only a day or two , that there was a great deal left in him , that he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward peace and sane relativity ? For him it took those wild and quiet places to do it , but perhaps for others , for Rachel and her mother , new people , unfamiliar streets and buildings and tongues would do it . It seemed to him undeniable that most of human trouble and suffering was human made , that , as Jeffers put it , it arose like an evil exhalation from " the race turning inward , " from " the dream festering , " but certainly there was no cleavage between human life and the rest of nature , and it was quite possible that his own hunger for solitude and the non-human was quite as much an inturning , a festering of the dream as was an appetite for human activity which seemed to him mostly a monkey-like response to mere distraction . And of course , though it was odd how little he had realized it in school , Rachel had always been a more sociable person than he was . He remembered innumerableevidences of her popularity to which he had given no thought then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lc had gone along blindly believing that Rachel felt just the way he did about everything , simply because he had immediately recognized in her signs of the same terrible shyness he knew so well in himself . What ugly twist of jealousy , or of malice toward him ; he wondered , had led Pauline Chester into inventing those distortionsof Rachel 's struggle to be liked by others , to escape the influence of her unhappy home ? Pauline had been afraid , with him sitting there , his hostility and skepticism probably only too evident in his expression and in the few non-committal words he would say , to make clear accusations , and yet she had been the more driven to torment him with hints that Rachel , even when he had known her in high school , had been far more generous to other boys than to him , and that she had even played the laughing little wanton with mature men at clubs and at drinking parties in private homes and apartments . It had been so easy for him to believe that Rachel could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he had done to her , that these impossible tales had hurt terribly . He had even wondered , with a pain of loss which became an actual physical agony , if the same blindness which had led him blundering into the mortification of the moss-agate , had also made him blind to what Rachel might do with others . This doubt of the goddess had never lasted long , though , and had always been followed by a secondary agony of repentance because he had even considered such lies . They were incredible when he thought of anything he knew about Rachel , the quick smile , the little , clenched fists , the twinkling walk , almost a run , but seldom gay , the passionate integrity , secrecy , honesty . They were doubly incredible now , looked back on , and with the thought of Mrs. Wells in his mind , like Rachel grown up . He remembered meeting Mrs. Wells downtown , a long time after Rachel had gone away to school , two years , he thought , or more . She had given him Rachel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to be an ally . How hard he had worked at that letter . He had wanted a letter from Rachel , the marks of her own hand on the paper . Yet twice he had given way to an uncontrolled outpouring , trying again to tell her everything , before he had , holding himself in an iron grip , testingthe outward aspect of each dry , false word , written the polite little note it would be possible for her to answer , as if a chance word from her mother had reminded him of her existence . She had answered him in a note of the same kind , nothing real in it , yet he had carried that note around in his pocket until it was worn out . It had been a sacred talisman to him , he could n't say exactly of hope , but certainly of life in the world when he had begun to doubt it , of Rachel still her precious , inestimable , secret self , seeing the sun , the ocean , hearing the wind in trees and grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was so near Tim all the time now , began to envelop him again . I lc made a wry , selfcontemptuousgrin . So he had seduced himself into the idiotic youngness after all . He lit a cigarette and switched into St. Louis P370Blues . When Rachel came down , he did n't hear her in the hall . He was playing a blues of his own , which he called Moon in the Street , and singing it under his breath . Old moon , she 's my friend ; ai n't no friend to know . Same old moon she 's my friend ; ai n't no friend to know . My baby done left me ; There ai n't no place to go . I keep asking , " Old Moon , how come you look so cold ? " Keep on asking , " Old Moon , how come you look so cold ? " Moon she 's telling me , says , " Because I 'm getting old . " I keep telling old moon , " Go on outa my street . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outa my street . " Old moon she do n't care noneDo n't 1 never get no sleep . Rachel came in quietly and crossed to the big window and stood looking out at the mountain . Tim stopped singing , but played Moon in the Street through once more , slowly and softly , while he watched her . When he stopped playing , she turned . " I like that , Tim , " she said . " Is it yours ? " She sat down on the arm of the chair beside the window . She did n't seem to be in a hurry . She wanted to talk . Possibly he had been wrong about what was going on in her when she stopped in the hall to look around . Maybe it had all been in his own mind . Certainly there were no signs of the little soldier about her now . She was her present self , part of the world which had left this house behind . It already seemed impossible that he should have worried about something happening to her upstairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter and old talk . He nodded in answer to her question , but when she asked what else he had been writing , he found himself reluctant to talk about his music . He was still eager , too eager , that after this meeting he should remain somebody in her memory , and it seemed to him , here , in her presence , that everything he had been doing , his reading , brooding , wondering , arguing , had been concentrated upon one end , the writing of good music , music with his own mark on it , and that actually he had n't written one note of such music , and would only expose this emptiness to her if he talked or played . I lowever , he did play another of his blues , I 'm Always Thinking Too Many , and then the White Horse , and by talking about them , Rachel led him to discuss some of his ideas , and to play a few brief , illustrative passages , which he broke off short each time , saying , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to give you an idea . " When finally he opened up , it was in a manner which surprised him as much as it did Rachel . He had been improvising softly for a minute or two , neither of them speaking , when Rachel started the conversation that set him off . " Fay says you 've been working on a symphony , Tim . Helen Black told her about it . " " I threw it away , " Tim said . " Helen told Fay there were some very lovely passages in the parts she heard . " " It was no good . " " You ca n't always be sure about your own work , can you , Tim ? " Rachel asked softly . " That , " Tim said sharply , " is a superstition with which listeners comfort themselves for ignorance and writers for havinglet out stuff they knew was lousy . " He looked up , and Rachel was watching him curiously . She seemed hesitant , perhaps even hurt . " No , that 's not always true , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when you 're still close to a piece of work . After a little while you know , though , better than anybody else . I 've had time enough . " " Just the same , I 'd like to hear some of it , " Rachel said . So he began to play his last version of the Court Street theme . It did n't even occur to him to wonder why he had selectedP372this passage , the one in which he had always begun to fail . It sounded very thin and sad on the untuned piano in the empty house , and he let it dwindle out finally in a series of inconclusiveminor chords , and at the very end made two discordant thumps . " No , what I really am , " he said abruptly , " is a horn blower in a honky-tonk band , a very bad honky-tonk band . " Then , because that remark sounded like deliberate , humorless understatement , which is really nothing but inverted boasting , he went on quickly to describe the band . His description @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come , when she was n't already laughing . He described the five of them sitting there , four of them in a small semi-circle around the feet of Fatso , the huge drummer , who loomed over them like some satiated jungle god , motionless save for his hands and one foot , his third chin resting upon his second stomach , his hair hanging down in two horns over his eyes which were perpetually . fixed in a glassy stare upon the far corner of the room , which he never saw . He described his own sensations of being a musicalmadam , and invented examples of how their music , by creating a great sadness and revulsion against life , a yearning for annihilation , hastened affairs among the dancers and was the greatest power in the business . He said their most successful melody had been Lover , Come Back to Me , and gave a detailed account of the reasons for its success , the effects upon certain glands , and in varying degrees of inebriation or marijuana happiness , of given phrases played by different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the piano , imitating the jerky rhythm and off-beat entries with which the band played Lover , Conic Back to Me . He imitated the trumpet through cupped hands , the clarinet through a pinched nose , the drum on the floor and the lower end of the keyboard , keeping the piano going between times . He was surprised himselfat what he 'd got into . He 'd never done anything like this before . Rachel was really amused , waiting all the time for what came next , and he became inspired , in a sharp , self-contemptuousway . Beating with his foot , tinkling with his fin- P373gers , he went on : " We apply the latest , laboratory-tested methods of business-volume measurement and the sampling of customer reaction . Nothing is left to chance . The elaboratestatistical graphs we have developed have been written up in three magazines of nation-wide circulation , including Fortune , and adopted in practice by fourteen international business-machine companies , to say nothing of the innumerableprivate businesses and our special forms for use in the home . Each evening I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case . This card is divided into columns which we term barometricindices or thermal registers , modes of measurement indistinguishable for our purposes . The columns are headed : Degree of Rigidity of Female , Degree of Reluctance of Male , Alcoholic Content , Number of Steps Taken Per Unit of Rhythm , Emotional-Financial Equation of Male , Expression of Ticket Seller , etc . We strive to take every factor into consideration , marijuana , as I have already hinted , hashish , hypos , even tobacco , weather outside , other activities in town that night , and so on , as well as variation of basic factors above listed at different degrees of light , heat , smoothness of floor , etc . We use outside scouts to check after-affects of each combination according to destinations and distances , as well as means of conveyance . We even keep a personal index on the girls , in order to discover what music will improve individual performance . Let us say , for instance , that Constance , artificial redhead , aged 32 years , height 5 ft. 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , waist 20 in. , hips 42 in. , evening gown type , appears disconsolate and remains in the dance hall all evening , often not dancing , tindera program composed of Brown Eyes , Why Are You Blue ? played thirteen times , Mexicali Rose ten , Avalon To-urn seven . The next evening we will vary the program , say Mexicali Rose thirteen , Avalon Town ten , Brown Eyes seven . It is better , but still not good . Say she leaves at 12:32 with a lumberjack from Lassen who , according to our scouts , has already been rolled the night before and is still in possession of only three or four dollars which he kept in his socks , which were not removed . The next evening we vary the program again , Avalon Town P374thirteen , etc . Results indicate a downward trend . Constance , art . r.h. , 32 , 5-6 , etc. , leaves at 1:09 with a waiter from a restaurantwhich is practically in the business , so that no extras may be expected . Besides , he is probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hamburg with mustard , since he is unfortunatelyprejudiced by un-scientific deductions of his own concerning the case history . We switch the program , throwing in , let us say , at thirteen first , Yes , We Have No Bananas , retainingMexicali Rose , Avalon Town . We try these three in different combinations , as before . Results vary , but nothing positive . At the end of a week , we drop Avalon Town and try Star Dust . And so on . Remember , the inspiration of science is patience . Then comes the night we try Wabash Blues at thirteen , and Constance , art . r.h. , 32 , etc. , leaves at 9:06 with a broker from San Francisco who wears pince-nez glasses and a pin-stripe suit , and was had , according to our scout , at the Alfalfa Club the night before for $1257.50 without batting aeyelash . Good . We have it . For several months , it varies wit the girl , of course , we know that we can bring Constance up to par with an injection of Wabash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exact number of renditions which will market her to best advantage . And so it goes . You perceive th general method . Only its thoroughness is unusual in scientifi business practice . " But there is another factor of our method which is , to th best of my knowledge , unique . Below the factor register and the register of girls , I keep a third in columns extended from those above , which is termed Index of Coincidence of Instru mental Accidentals . The purpose of this register is simple . It i detail which counts , and a sufficient accumulation of deta may in time even formulate a consistent and practical style for the band . It works this way . On the evening when Constanc art . r.h. , etc. , leaves at q : o6 with broker , S.F. , pince-nez , etc I jot down , at the moment of her exit , the exact passage o Wabash Blues being played , and as nearly as possible all the factors involved in the particular emotional and tonal effect of that passage , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicide , silent ; pianist softly playing Aloha with his left hand ; drummer using only bass drum and brush for 47 minutes now ; saxophone carrying air with strict attention to score , resting on thirteenth vertebra , tapping with extended left foot ; clarinet also steady , but peculiar effect attained at momentby coughing several times , rapidly , without lowering instrument . When we are done that night , the merest glance at the data shows me that there was no unusual factor at the momentsave the cough of the clarinet . Good , we test it . Wabash Blues , other selections . Trumpet playing , sax silent , with same cough in clarinet . Three coughs , four coughs , eight coughs , ten coughs to the measure . You see the method . At the end of a month we are able to send Constance , etc. , within five minutes of first noticing that she is in depressed spirits , and never with a companion lower in the economic scale than a blackjack dealer from an in-house . " It is on the basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to detail , and application of findings in the co-ordinated indexes , that we are able to say with certainty that , in general , over all the girls , in any combination of temperature , light , alcohol , etc. , with any combination of visiting personnel , and according to the best-established tests made independentlyby the ticket seller and our outside agents , we have succeeded three to one over any other number with Lover , Come Back to Me .... " Played , " Tim said more loudly , pounding his foot harder on the floor , and illustrating each statement with the suitable sound , " by the piano doing Aloha with the left hand , sax carrying the air from score , on thirteenth vertebra , left leg extended , foot tapping , clarinet coughing five times to the bar , drums bass and brush , and trumpet  --  all of this when we have our full complement , of course  --  silent except on the last chorus . " He did the chorus as loudly as possible , stamping his feet untilthe room echoed , approximating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trumpet noise , a little off key and going as it pleased , wah-wah-wah , and stopping the noises one at a time , not quite together , except Aloha , which he played softly P376with both hands , in a vacant , running , dinner-music way , while he spoke . " It is true , to be sure , that during that period we played Lover , Come Back to Me three times as often as any other number , which might have had something to do with its success . " He stopped playing and sat staring at the keyboard . In the quiet , the frail , sardonic inspiration which had run away on its own , faded out of him quickly , and he was revolted by what he had done . Rachel laughed . " How long did it take you to work that up , Tim ? " she asked . He looked across the piano at her . " Clown , " he thought . " Alwayseverything else but ... " " First performance , " he said . " Unrehearsed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to complimenthim on this spontaneous nonsense . He got up from the piano and went across to the chair opposite her . " But it will do , " he said , grinning , " as a history , with examples , of the musical development of T. Hazard . It leaves little more to be said . " Rachel sat looking at him , seriously and curiously . " Now , " he said , " how about the history of R. Wells ? " " Nothing in particular has developed in the case of R. ' Wells , " she said , smiling , showing a little confusion . It was the quick smile again , although it did n't die into complete seriousnessquite so immediately as it once had . It pierced him . He again felt the cold wind of time rushing past . " What have you been doing lately ? " he asked . " Social service , " she said , looking at her hands in her lap . " In the city . " He remembered that he had asked her that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to tell him about the work . Gradually she explained her philosophy of the work . To her , it was waiting ; it was a poor substitute for the basic changes which should be made in order that no one need feel like an object of charity . She told of the trouble she had with many ofp377the cases she interviewed , people who resented this dependency , and treated her as the cause of it . " I 'm afraid I 'm often inefficient , " she said , " because I know that their feeling is justified . Not many of them have any ideas about it . They simply resent me , and I feel guilty . I feel almost like apologizing to them . " After that the talk was easy , all ideas . They searched each other out through thoughts and feelings , with no personal conversation , with almost no words about the past . They bridged the years more really and completely by telling each other what they thought about prominent public figures , about books and music , about theories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook her head over his favorite writers , declaring that she no longer had the courage to read them , though as they talked it became clear that she had read most of them , often more thoughtfully than he had read them . The signs of the knowledge of darkness and pain which she had gained during these years were in everything she said , but she was generally gentle , and even , and a little shy in her judgments . She also defended the romantic and impressionistic composersagainst him , and Tim found it so easy to talk to her now , and so wonderful to be thus at ease in her presence , that he did n't take off on any of his prolific flights of condemnation , but found himself remembering quietly how the music they were discussing sounded , and often agreeing with her . He guessed , feeling her attitude in everything she said , noting her comments on science and sociology and her bits of first-person philosophy , that she was religious in the same way he was , altogetherby desire , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if embarrassed by a boldness , that she supposed she was nearer a socialist than anything else to which a name could be applied . Certainly she had no faith in a dictatorship , by any class whatever . There was no such thing as a class dictatorship . There was either a representative government , in which the form of national life changed slowly as opinion developed , or there was a dictatorship , which could mean , when you wereP378done quibbling , only one thing , a nation subject to the whim of ' one man . Without saying anything about what she herself had been doing or feeling there , for which he found himself listening always , she talked about what was going on in Europe , about the wobbling republic in Germany , about Mussolini and about the troubled , conflicting French politics . She had never talked to him so much before . It gave him a secret joy beyond anything they said , to be so long in her presence without strain . It was almost as if he had succeeded at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this was only because he remained himself and did n't experience any urge to violate her mind , her separate presence , beyond the buffoonery at the piano . His first impression had been right . She had won the long battle of Rachel vs . Rachel . He could feel in the little person sitting before him , with the light of the summer desert on her from the window of a dead house , a depth of sadness which was no longer personal , a reaching of the mind and an embracing of the world , a quickness of perception and feeling that was undiminished , but was not now sharp or defensive . Now the stirrings within her were large and slow and full , and the quick percep- ' tions were only ripples upon these tidal movements . There were no more walls , no more sentries on the towers , no more desperatedaring of the world by the tiny one . In the sadness there was no agony , or dread , or expectation of being humiliated . She had come through splendidly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was almost jealous . She laughed more easily and more often than he had ever heard her laugh before , and from joy or gentle pleasure , or from amusement , not merely from relief . Sometimes she seemed to him , as he sat there looking at her and listening to her , to have become too big for her little body , which was n't greatly changed . Then again she would seem physically a larger person , able to contain easily all she had become . She contained herself easily . There , all in one , was the great difference . Finally , when the sun was low over the mountains , she said , just as if they were old and easy friends , who had always been P379equals , " I hate to break this up , Tim , but I 'm afraid I 'll have to . " She stood up . " I 'm very late already . " But then she went to the window again , and stood there lookingout at the mountain . " You know , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's alwaysseemed to me that I should go up there . I used to look at it so much , from this window . I kept thinking about it when I was away . I felt as if I 'd failed to do something important in that part of my life . " She turned into the room again , smiling at him . " It was queer , " she said , " almost a religious sensation of omission , as if I could n't know the world and the word until I had looked around from up there . You used to go up there quite a lot , did n't you ? " She turned back to the window . He came and stood beside her , stooping to see under the vines . So near sunset , the mountainwas higher and darker and had recovered its austerity . The afternoon wind had died . The air between the house and the mountain was very quiet and golden . The trees were quiet in the golden air , only a few leaves at a time whispering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of being on the peak or in the highest meadow under it , or among the twisted trees in the pass , he felt ashamed of his night-tired body and the weary , ndirected wrestling of his mind . Looking at the mountain heckthe joy of being in a high place , of stopping the mind offwith the filled eyes and the quiet , fallow spirit that came up here . Then he thought , wryly , that the mountain would probablyreject him now . Certainly he was no fit pilgrim . " There 's a little lake up there , " he said . " Snow water stays inall summer . Whenever I come down by that trail , I swim mere . It 's become a kind of ceremony with me . I have n't been p for a long time now , " he said , still looking at the mountain . " Tim , let 's go up tomorrow , " Rachel said . They made their plans while she drove him down to his office lidding on Second Street . When he got out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really do n't mind ? Taking me up there , I can ? " P380He shook his head and grinned . He could n't have explained to himself why he so much wanted to take her up there , why , for the first time in months , maybe in years , he was excited by a sense of impending discovery . It would have seemed important that he was to be with her anywhere , but that was n't all of it . He did n't expect any miracles to occur . Or did he ? " Nonsense , " he said . " You know there 's nothing I 'd like better to do . Besides , if you did n't go , I probably would n't go at all , and think how bad that would be , just when you have aroused me to the contemplation of such unwonted activity . " " Fine , " Rachel said , laughing softly . " And I promise I wo n't spoil your swim . I 'll go and hide my head , so you can take your swim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corneronto Lake Street . Then he bounded up the stairs , let himself into his room , shaved and changed his shirt , humming Moon i the Street with a very gay step-up as he did so , grabbed tw new arrangements he had made for the band , and fled bac down the stairs . He found Fatso Carmichal , the drummer , wedged in behind the table at a booth in Benner 's , eating pig ' knuckles and kraut in slow , huge mouthfuls , and left the score with him , saying he would n't be up to play that night ; he had to get sonic sleep . 1 le felt an affection for everybody in Benner 's , although he did n't know most of them , and delighted i the place itself , its brown , soupy air , old pictures , worn coun ters . He ate supper with Fatso . When he got back to his room , it seemed newly alive to His books were full of people and places and ideas with wine he should revive acquaintance . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music aching to be put forth in the air . He bathe singing Old 97 at the top of his voice , put on his pajama pan and flopped on the bed with The Education of Henry Adam but after a few minutes gave up the discouraged old scholar , g ( out his violin , and began to pad about the room with it , play in cheerfully and furiously . It was while he was thus parading tit ' he realized that The Prayer for the Evil Days still hung there .. P381over his bed . He stopped playing long enough to yank it down , crumple it up , and chuck it into the waste basket . The MountainTHEY left the car under a pine by the creek that came down from the north ridge , and walked slowly out onto the summit meadow , and stood in the sun and looked at the heights around them . It was only a little after eight o'clock , and t lie air was still cold , but it would be warm enough before long . The sky was cloudless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin sunlight seemed to reach everything . The insects had already begun to king for heat . Their piercing sound was everywhere , like a radio tone in the bones , or an audible aspect of the light itself . After a while it would n't be noticed at all , except for the changes , the sudden clicking or whirring near by . On the north and west , the steep ridges they were going to climb stood up out of the thin forest into the light . They loomed close over the meadow . Far off , on the south slope of the meadow , a big flock of sheepas grazing down toward the hollow . They were scatteredwide across the slope and up among the mouton rocks above , nd looked like small boulders or bushes themselves until one of he dogs began to race above them , bringing down stragglers . ' This quicker motion made them real , and then Tim and Rachel could pick out the herder and the burro too . The dog must have been barking , but they could n't hear him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at the western ridge . " I can feel the height already , " she said . " We 'd better catch up a little , before we start , " Tim said . He could feel his own heart shaking , and the little irritation and ightiness of thought that came from the altitude . I le lit a cigatteand stretched out on the grass . Rachel sat down with her back against a boulder and her arms behind her head , and ooked up at the sky . They talked a little about the sky and the ight and about the flock of sheep , and let the time pass . Only P382one sound they could hear came from the flock , the shrill whistleof the herder . It came to them as a tiny sound . " I guess I 'm ready , " Rachel said . They went back to the car , and Tim took out a tube of zinc ointment and smeared the ointment on his nose and lips and cheek-bones and the tops of his ears , and gave the tube to Rachel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into the pack , and slung the pack on , hitching it high , where he liked it , and fastenedthe canteen onto his belt . He led the way slowly onto the north ridge , because there was no clear trail at the beginning . He zigzagged across the face of the ridge , gaining a little height on each tack . He was trying to keep his pace behind his pulse until they leveled off and the good feeling came that he could go on forever . Until you found that steady ratio , you were like two people fighting each other . First you got angry and wanted to bolt ; then you thought you could n't do it at all . You could n't receive what the mountains had to give until the quarrel was over . He lookeback twice , and Rachel was coming along all right , and smile at him . When he reached a stretch of clear trail that went along t flank of the , ridge , through great , heavy-leafed plants that ma a musky stink in the sun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen behind . She was climbing stubbornly , and n looking around . I lc sat down on a rock . When Rachel came u she sat down too . I lcr face was flushed , and after a moment s leaned over and put her head on her knees . He could see h whole body stir forward with each beat of her heart . After a couple of minutes she looked up and grinned . " If quit , you go ahead anyway , will you ? " " It 's not as bad as that , " he said . " It was my fault . You g ahead and set the pace where you feel all right . " " If I did n't keep slipping , " she said . He showed her how to climb pigeon-toed , and putting the whole foot down at each step , instead of keeping on the toes . When she was steady again , they went on . She entered the woods ahead of him , and the sun and shadow slipped down her P383back steadily , in changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be ready for the next pitch . This made him loiter , which was all right , except that they would n't be together , they would n't be in the mountains , until they could get over thinking about how they were walking . Yet against this irritation worked his feeling of cherishing her . Little surges , dangerously like the old adoration , flowed through him often as he watched that small figure going steadily and intently through the chill under the trees ahead of him , in the old brown sweater with the sleeves pushed up above her elbows . At the top of the first ridge , where the creek cut through and began to drop rapidly in white water , they stopped to drink . Rachel knelt and drank slowly , scooping the water up in her two hands together and sucking at it . She appeared nearly entranced . He was experiencing the same thing , the first otherworldlinessof the heights . He lay down , propping himself on his hands , and drank from the running water . They sat down shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken water flashing in the light , and the softly stirring designs of the pine boughs on the old , red needles . " It 's wonderful here , is n't it ? " Rachel said dreamily . " You would n't believe anyone else ever came here , except for the trail . " " It 's only too many people at once that spoil the balance , " Tim said . On the next ridge , Tim found himself , and got the happy , steady feeling , and the hunger to see and remember everything . ' hey were climbing back and forth among big boulders here , nd the trees were fewer and smaller . Rachel was very quiet , nd stopped often , but on the way down the other side , she found herself too , and when they came onto the meadow beyond , Tim could tell by the lift in her walk and the way she coked around that she was all right . There were small , white butterflies dancing over the meadow , and sometimes glassy dragonflies flashed over the black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem quick and gay . Then youlooked across the meadow , which was open to the west , and P384there was the wall of the steep ridge , bare except for a few twisted trees in crevices . It was already shimmering with heat . The ridge looked down on the meadow , and the meadow belonged to it , and the heights clearly asserted their strong and religious power . Tim came forward and walked beside Rachel as they crossed the meadow . He felt happy and childish . He wanted to touch her constantly , not to make love , but just to touch her hand or her arm or her face , or to feel her hair to make her seem more real . Her hair was long and heavy now , and for the climb she had done it up into a braid around her head . It was wonderful hair . But also he liked the feeling of not touching her . It was a full , satisfying kind of restraint , like not letting himself run or whistle or yodel or talk because of his happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the north was a low , sandy whaleback . He wanted to tell her what was coming on the other side of this bare whaleback , but he would n't do that either . He wanted more to watch her sec it without expecting it . They came onto the top of the whaleback , and Rachel saw it and stopped , and stood there looking down . " This is your place , Tim , is n't it ? " she asked finally . Ile nodded . " I do n't Hanle you , " she said . " It 's wonderful . It 's queer too . There 's not much there , but everything seems to mean somethingparticular . I feel as if I ought to study it , learn the symbols , before I went down . " " It 's no use , " he said . " I feel that way every time I come here , and I have n't figured it out yet . " Part way down the slope were the three twisted trees , like parts of one tree , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there very importantly with their shadows , and the loose , blackened stones of a fireplace under them . Then , in the hollow below , sheltered on the other side by a steeper wing of the mountain than the one they were on , was the little , dark lake , with the wiry grass standing up in the edge of it . On the cast , close above , a steep mountain of white boulders guarded theP385lake , and much farther away , on the west , was the high ridge . The lake lay still , and they began to see into its shadows . Then the wind came gently from the ridge , and feathered the surface , and it was all the color of sky and the white boulders , and they could n't see into it at all . Finally they went down and stood at the edge of the lake , and could see the shadows again , and the murky lights which made the water appear very deep . Frogs leapt out into the water from among the tough grass , and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the boulders and the dark , crouching trees , a chipmunk was chittering . While they were standing there , a hawk sailed up out of the white mountain against the wind . From a high point directly over the lake , he banked and fled swiftly down across the wind and out of sight behind the north ridge . These small , wild sounds and movementswere intensely significant , touching the profundity of the place itself . When the hawk was gone , Tim knelt and put one hand into the water . " I always have to touch water , " he said , grinning . Rachel also knelt and put her hand in . " Now I 'm initiated , " she said . " Now you 're initiated . " While they were climbing the wooded ridge , he said , " Tonightyou 'll know . " " Know what ? " " If you 've really been initiated ; if you 've been accepted . We 'll go back there for supper , and watch the moon come up . " " I 'm being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very special . But you have to climb the mountain and come back before you understand them , " he added . " They 're not my privileges ; they 're the lake 's and the guardians ' . You 're only an acolyte now . " " I suppose I must be , " she said , " though I feel as if I 'd been here all my life already . At first nothing up here seemed real to me . Now it 's everything else that does n't . I never lived in San Francisco . That was a dream , and a rather empty one . "
