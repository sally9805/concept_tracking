Before the war , 13 out of every 1,000 Army student pilots were killed in training . Since the war the fatality rate has risen to 20 in every 1,000 . These and other figures , based on Army Air Forces ' Office of Flying Safety tables , were released last week by OWI . Considering the vast expansion of A.A.F. , the greenness of its new hands and the " hot " aircraft needed for war training , OWI echoed the average airman 's opinion : A.A.F. had done a good job of keeping accidents down . Other items : <P> &gt; In flying training the rate of fatal accidents is about the same as before the war . But in combat training the rate has skyrocketed from 82 fatal accidents in every million hours of flying to 182 . <P> &gt; In combat training the fatality rate ( a " fatal crash " may cause one or many " fatalities " ) jumped from 145 for each million hours to 521 . <P> &gt; Chief cause of accidents : errors by pilots and ground crews- responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third of all fatal accidents defy analysis . <P> &gt; Most frequent kind of fatal crash is collision in full flight with mountains , trees , telephone poles . Collisions with other aircraft : only 8.5% . <P> &gt; Safest plane to fly is a primary trainer ; most dangerous , a fighter .
