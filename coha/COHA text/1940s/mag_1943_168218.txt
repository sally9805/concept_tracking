The Russian Story ( Artlino ) gives such U.S. audiences as can get to it a chance to see several great episodes from the ill-distributed Soviet film masterpieces of the past two decades . They are , however , grossly mulled &; mauled into an attempted movie history of Russia . The history is propagandists and sketchy ( one notable omission is Napoleon ) and the end result is a considerable cinematic crime . <P> The picture was flung together in the U.S. with the blessing of the National Council for American Soviet Friendship . A flatulent commentary with lines like " Fly , you banners-there is no wind strong enough to blow you down " is ping-ponged between Blues-Singer Libby Holman and mopey Actor Morris Carnovsky . The famous suspense with which Director Sergei Eisenstein prefaced the battle in Alexander Nevsky has been unmercifully hacked when half a minute of editorial discretion would have kept it whole , and the excellent battle music which Prokofieff contrived for that sequence becomes an aural trunk murder . Eisenstein 's appalling scene in which soldiers drive civilians down a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also been tampered with - it is now a shambles instead of a few minutes of cinema as brilliantly organized as a movement in a Beethoven symphony . <P> Yet the picture is worth seeing-its great excerpts from the past are tributes to directors of genius and to a nation which , for a while , gave them a chance to work as cinema talents have seldom been permitted to work . Even in mangled form , such scenes as the silver blaze of ripe wheat and sunflowers full of struggling men , crazed horses and black explosions ( in Director Alexander Dovzhenko 's Shors ) are still able to make any perceptive U.S. filmgoer who has seen only the best advertised native films wonder , seriously , whether he has ever seen a real moving picture before . These Russian classics shine against the cheap , easy sheen of most films ( and much of this film ) as nobly as a battle flag against the patriotism worn by a chorus girl for a breechclout . <P> Spitfire ( Goldwyn-RKO-Radio ) can serve as a fine epitaph for gentle , charming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot down in the Bay of Biscay ( TIME , June 14 ) . Howard produced , directed and played the lead in the film . The picture itself is a finely tasteful , faithful biography of one of Britain 's newest and least-known heroes-the late , great aircraft designer Reginald Joseph Mitchell . As designer of the tactically superior* Spitfire fighter , Mitchell was one of a few men-Churchill was another - whose foresight had much to do with saving Britain and her allies .
