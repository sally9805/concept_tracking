The eight top U.S. motion picture companies last week got something they could really call colossal : a cocky , teen-aged messenger barged into their showy Manhattan offices , left checks totaling over $42,500,000-the biggest single batch of cash Hollywood has ever seen . The checks , ranging from $11,267,000 for Loew 's Inc. to $2,113,000 for Columbia Pictures Corp . represented money owed by British film distributors ever since the outbreak of war in 1939 when the Exchequer abruptly barred all cash payments . <P> First-Class Business . This windfall comes smack atop the biggest year in U.S. cinema history . The stampede to spend new-found cash and forget the war with Mickey Rooney or Hedy Lamarr has shoved movie attendance to almost 100,000,000 weekly , 15% above last year . Around war plants the flickers play to standees at every show , theater walls fairly bulge with ogling patrons . Result : total box-office take of 16,500 U.S. cinemansions this year will hit a record $1.3 billion-20% above the peak year 1930 . <P> Because producer profits are geared directly to theater receipts this means prosperity-plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profits from 1941 's $861,000 to $2,191,000 ; giant Paramount Pictures lifted nine months ' earnings from $7,450,000 to $9,278,000 ; Columbia tripled June year-end profits to $1,612,000 . Total 1942 movie profits may hit a peak since 1929 . <P> Secondhand Scenery . This delightful picture may not have a Hollywood happyending . Last week the film colony had two big dolors : <P> 1 ) The $25,000 salary ceiling was raising hob with high-priced stars , directors , writers , producers . At week 's end the Treasury Department modified its rules so that movie colonists can earn more in 1942 than in 1941 provided their contracts so specify . But in 1943 no cinestar can earn more than $25,000 net-a figure many of them once got for a single picture . Plain &; simple out : lower salaries . <P> 2 ) Government restrictions were raising hob with production . One horror : a $5,000 top on new materials used in the sets in any one picture . To movie directors who once thought nothing of spending $300,000 for stages and costumes in a single musicomedy , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys went to work , are now using such non-Hollywood items as retouched scenery , secondhand lumber , repaired costumes-even unkinked used nails . Besides this WPB has cut film use by 10% to 24% , threatens a still bigger cut next year . <P> How long before this sorry-go-round breaks down nobody knows . But veteran independent producer Samuel Goldwyn suspects it may be soon , fortnight ago predicted that a picture shortage was unquestionably on the way . His advice : make pictures while the film and actor last .
