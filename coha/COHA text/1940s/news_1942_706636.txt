txt Philip Murray , president of the Congress of Industrial Organizations , proposed in a letter today to William Green , president of the American Federation of Labor , a reopening of negotiations to establish organic unity Jetween the organizations in the interest of America 's war program . He stipulated , however , that the negotiations must in no wise be permitted to interfere with continued joint action between the two organizations " on issues affecting the fullest possible prosecution of the war effort . " He told Mr. Green that he was naming a committee of three " to meet a committee named by your organization to probe into this question . " The committee named by Mr. Murray consists of R. J. Thomas , president of the United Automobile Workers ; Julius Emspak , secretary of the United Electrical , Radio and Machine Workers , and himself . Mr. Murray also urged that the work of the Combined Labor Victory Committee be intensified in the interest of " winning the war against our Axis enemies . " Hits Some A. F. of L. Affiliates He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he " assumed that this commitment included jurisdictional problems ? ? between affiliates " of the A. F. of L. and the C , I. 0 . He added : " We have , therefore , been deeply concerned about the stoppages which have been caused by certain affiliates of the A. F. of L. because of some jurisdictional dispute . " He declared that no work stoppages must be permitted because of jurisdictional disputes and offered a : new plan for arbitration of such disputes . Mr. Murray 's action toward labor unity removes from the picture John L. Lewis , who , until a few weeks ago , asserted that he was chairman of the standing C. L 0 . peace committee . Sidney Hillman , who , with Mr. Lewis and Mr. Murray , made up the old committee , is ill and would be unable to serve . The executive council of the A. F. of L. is scheduled to meet Tuesday at Chicago and it is expected that the Murray peace proposal will be made the first order of business . The A. F. of L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tobin , international president of the Teamsters Union ; Harry C. Bates , head of the Bricklayers Union , and William L. Hutcheson , president of the Carpenters Union . As in the case of the C. L 0 . committee , it is probable that the A. F. of L. committee will be reviaed . Leading proponents of organic unity on both sides have repeatedly voiced opposition to further participation by Mr. Lewis and Mr. Hutcheson in the negotiations . Tobin Attack on Lewis Mr. Tobin , in the current issue 7f his magazine , The International Teamster , took violent exception to published reports linking him with a Hutcheson-manoeuvred " deal " to bring Mr. Lewis back into the A. F. of L. Mr. Tobin , the article declared , was deeply desirous of labor unity , but " he is not attempting to achieve labor unity by bringing the greatest destroyer of labor unity back into the A. F. ot L. " Mr. Tobin attacked the " political affinity " between Mr. Lewis and Mr. Hutcheson and cited his long record of opposition to the two men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Murray 's proposal today caused surprise in labor circles , since he had shown considerable aloofness toward the subject , particularly at the time of the attempt by Mr. Lewis to call such a conference without first having // MURRAY PROPOSES LABOR UNITY TALKS // discussed the move with associated C. I. 0 . leaders . Again in May , when the A. F. of L. executive council sought to arrange a conference , Mr. Murray suggested , instead of organic unity , a tightening of the present system of " functional " unity . It was understood to have been his opinion at the time that to throw open the vast issues of overlapping jurisdiction might tend to create confusion and turmoil in the ranks of workers at a time when harmonious relations were vital to the war program . Mr. Green , Mr. Tobin and other A. F. of L. leaders did not concur in this view . It was Mr. Green 's contention that a united labor movement could act more effectively to help America win the war . " Instead of labor wasting Its strength in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time , " a united labor movement could concentrate its energies on improving the economic , social and political interests of the workers of this country . " Text of Murray Letter Mr. Murray 's letter to Mr. Green was as follows : " Dear Mr. Green : " In the interest of the nation , the Congress of Industrial Organizations and the American Federation of Labor , during the past several months , have been attempting to join on many issues which would afford greater strength to the national war effort . " At the present time there is a Combined Labor Victory Committee , consisting of representatives of the C. L 0 . and A. F. of L. , which meets with the President of the United States regarding all issues affecting labor 's participation in the prosecution of the war . I am sure that you . will agree with me that it is extremely important that the work of this committee be intensified in order that labor may lend every possible assistance to the outstanding national objective of winning the war against our Axis enemies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representatives of management and representatives of the government , adopted a national policy that there would be no stoppages of work , but that , in the interest of securing maximum production , all industrial disputes would be submitted to the National War Labor Board . Assumption on Accord " The C. I. 0 . assumed that this commitment included jurisdictional problems between affiliates of the A. F. of L. and affiliates of the C. I. 0 . We have therefore been deeply concerned about the stoppages which have been caused by certain affiliates of the A. F. of L. because of some Turisdictenni dispute . " As you know , from time to time I have suggested to you that these disputes be submitted to arbitration . Recently I have suggested that such disputes be submitted to arbitration by the War Labor Board . These suggestions have not been accepted . " I am firmly of the opinion that no stoppages of work can be permitted because of a jurisdictional dispute . The interest of our nation demands that there shall be continuous production and nothing must interfere . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. I. 0 . and A. F. of L. establish a committee of rep resentatives from both organizations , with an impartial arbitrator , to which shall be submitted all jurisdictional disputes which may arise between us . Pending a decision by such committee there shall be no stoppages of work . Problem of Organic Unity " The problem of organic unity has also been under discussion by our respective organizations . The C. I. 0 . has felt that we should not permit this problem to affect or interfere with the growing unity of action between our organizations in regard to the war effort . It is for this reason that we suggested that our energy be concentrated on the work of the Combined Labor Victory Committee . With the usefulness and need of that committee having been established , I believe that we can initiate discussions regarding possible tstablishment of organic unity between our organizations . " I am , therefore , naming a committee consisting of R. 3 . Thomas , Julius Emspak and the undersigned to meet a committee named by your organization to probe into this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to repeat the need of guaranteeing that the discussion between these two committees will not , under any circumstances , be permitted to interfere with the all-important matter of continued joint action between the C. I. 0 . and A. F. of L. on issues affecting the fullest possible prosecution of the war effort . "
