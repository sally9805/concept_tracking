IN THIS OUR LIFE - Ellen Glasgow - Harcourt , Brace ( $2.50 ) . <P> " When I consider her as a person , " wrote Novelist James Branch Cabell of his friend , Ellen Glasgow , " she arouses in me a dark suspicion . " Cabell 's suspicion is that Ellen Glasgow " is a gentlewoman as well as a genius in an era unfavorable to either . . . . " Ellen Glasgow has aroused even darker suspicions among U.S. readers . They have suspected that she is dull or highbrow , and have translated their suspicions into a considerable lack of interest . Some who have read her Barren Ground , without reading They Stooped to Folly , consider her a too stern daughter of the voice of God . Others who have read The Romantic Comedians , but not Vein of Iron , consider her a light-minded iconoclast from whose irony nothing is safe . <P> In 1938 the American Academy of Arts and Letters elected Novelist Glasgow to membership . But the Pulitzer Prize committee still has not recognized her existence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year that Sinclair Lewis published Arrowsmith which won the prize . In the next nine years the Pulitzer committee passed over three of her best books in favor of Bromfield 's Early Autumn , La Farge 's Laughing Boy , Stribling 's The Store . Novelist Glasgow went right on writing , revising , perfecting the series of novels which she had projected at the beginning of the Century - " a social history of Virginia . " <P> This week Ellen Glasgow , now 66 , added In This Our Life to this impressive series . Not her greatest book , it is an interesting detail in the mural of her life work . She had been working on this detail since 1935 , had revised it at least three times . It is not unusual for Novelist Glasgow to rewrite a single chapter 15 times . <P> Like most Glasgow novels , this one is laid in Queenborough , the imaginary Virginia town which she had made as much her literary province as Hardy made Wessex or Trollope Barsetshire . It is the story of the ineffectualness of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money but not his manners . The Timberlake fortune had been invested in a cigaret factory . Now factory and fortune belonged to the Standard Tobacco Company . Asa still had a job with Standard , but he never knew for how long . His wife , plain-faced Lavinia , had stooped to marry him . Later she developed a heart ailment that enabled her to wield an invalid power that she had never known in healthier days . Asa 's conscience is her slave . Sometimes he succeeds in sneaking off to spend Sunday with Kate Oliver on her river farm . His hope is that some day Uncle William will die and leave Lavinia a legacy . When that happened , Asa meant to leave and go to Kate . But when at last it did happen , it was already too late . Asa had begun to establish a protectorate over his daughter , Roy . " You will stand by me ? " Roy asked . " I will , Roy , as long as you need me . " " Looking up at the closed sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the harvested fields and the broad river . Still ahead , and within sight , but just out of reach , and always a little farther away , fading , but not ever disappearing , was freedom . "
