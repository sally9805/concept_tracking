Let their preservation be scrupulous in every detail . Let their numbers and distribution be sufficient so every German-with Allied encouragement , if necessary-be acquainted with them with Teutonic thoroughness . Let them be accessible to people of all countries as one of the distinguishing monuments of our time . . . . <P> <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
