Catholic , democratic Colombia last week rocked with a Guy Fawkes scandal . Almost on the eve of Congressional elections , police surrounded the impressive colonial Cathedral of Bogota . Before a party of Church and Government officials who sped to the scene , they respectfully uncovered 800 bombs in the organ loft . <P> Promptly , 42 suspects were seized . Three priests among them were released , but the police held fast to several retired military officers , two Cathedral sacristans , some lay brothers . All belonged to Colombia 's small clerical fascist clique which drew the country 's attention last summer when liberal President Alfonso Lopez was kidnapped . <P> Soon afterward , 400 more bombs were found in an apartment near the Presidential palace . Panicky plotters began to abandon their explosives in the streets . A bomb-filled suitcase was picked up outside the office of the National Comptroller . The bombs were all alike . Each consisted of a quarter-pound of dynamite and buckshot , tightly wrapped in cloth , with a detonator ingeniously arranged so that it would explode on impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemical technician , Rafael Velasquez . When he complained that the ordinary jail cells were cold , he was removed to detective headquarters . There he posed as a detective , escaped through the front door . <P> The police learned from the small son of a cook in the monastery adjoining the Cathedral that the choirmaster , a Christian Brother , had been storing bombs in his cell . Irrepressible Bogotanos , recalling how another of the Brothers had been blown up last February when a bomb exploded in his pocket , dubbed the order " Cuerpo de Bomberos " ( a pun , meaning either Fire Department or Bombers ' Corps ) . <P> One newspaper , El Siglo , property of Colombia 's most choleric orator , Laureano Gmez ( who went into self-imposed exile following the Presidential abduction last summer ) , roared that " arrests of clergymen violated the Concordat with the Vatican . " But the rest of the press saved its condemnation for the plotters . <P> Cried Archbishop Ismael Perdomo : " Criminally sacrilegious ! " <P> Cried Foreign Minister Alberto Lleras : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly .
