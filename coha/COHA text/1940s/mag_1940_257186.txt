Last week the American Journal of Digestive Diseases brought into the open a bitter dispute of long standing between physicians and surgeons . Ulcers of the stomach , most doctors believe , are caused by too much acid in the digestive juices . Too much acid corrodes the stomach lining at sensitive points , leaving a raw wound . But why some people have a constant gush of acid , instead of a gentle trickle at mealtime , is a mystery to doctors . Certain it is that tobacco and alcohol do a delicate stomach no good . Many authorities hold that ulcers are the fruits of temperament , for only worrying , sensitive , high-strung people are affected . Chief choice that confronts an ulcer victim is medical v. surgical treatment . <P> Last summer members of the American Gastro-Enterological Society held a meeting in Atlantic City . As usual , they talked mostly about ulcers . The doctors could speak from bitter experience , for as a professional group they have a high percentage of ulcers . Last week the American Journal of Digestive Diseases printed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and surgeons can only cut out pieces of flesh , the doctors had plenty to argue about . The patient as usual was left holding his stomach . Drift of the argument : <P> Keynote speaker was a noted surgeon , Dr. Irvin Abell of Louisville . The division of labor , he said , is clear . Any ulcers which do not heal with rest and special diets must be dealt with by surgeons . As for surgery , he went on , most experts believe it does little good merely to snip out the ulcer and patch up the stomach or intestine . For the incorrigible stomach keeps on brewing its corrosive acid . Most authorities hold that the best procedure is to cut out " three-fourths to four-fifths of the stomach . " Since the stomach is primarily a churn and a reservoir for big meals , it is possible to get along without it . Of course , said Dr. Abell , mortality rates for removal of most or all of the stomach are about 10% , but even so , the operation is worth trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 173 patients on whom he had operated ; 29 were desperate cases , and of these , all but five survived . These cases , said Dr. Berg , all came to him because they were " medical failures . " <P> Up jumped Physician Albert Frederick Ruger Andresen of Brooklyn . Since there is really no medical treatment for ulcers , said he with brilliant logic , there are no medical failures . Some ulcers heal of themselves . Both physicians and surgeons worry too much about stomach acids , he continued , instead of considering a patient 's temperament and general condition . And operation on desperate cases which have not been doctored up " is little short of murder . " <P> To this Dr. Berg made candid answer : " The surgeon can only be accused of accessory murder . The premeditated murder lies at the doorstep of those internists who permit their patients to get into such a deplorable state in which only the ' Hand of the Almighty ' could save them . Would Dr. Andresen let them all die ? . . . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I simply asked for a closer cooperation . "
