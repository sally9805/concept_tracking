How big will the postwar income of the U.S. be ? All goals for full postwar employment are mainly based on the accuracy of the answer to this question . Some of the estimates so far : <P> Vice President Henry Wallace : $170 billion . <P> Businessman-Planner Beardsley Ruml : $140 billion . <P> The Federal Reserve Board : $142 billion . <P> C.I.O. 's United Auto Workers : $200 billion . <P> This week , the Brookings Institution , famed for its economic studies , put out its own carefully considered estimate of postwar U.S. income , in an attempt to clear up the confusion . Net result was to add to the confusion , by stirring up a first-class row among economists . For one thing , the Brookings estimate was $123 billion , substantially lower than the most popular $140 billion boxcar figure which businessmen roll off their tongues . But the Brookings Institution then went on , in a brochure titled Postwar National Income , to whack all other postwar estimators as , in effect , so many dizzards , noodles , lackwits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Committee for Economic Development , the Department of Commerce , and Planner Ruml , as economists who either : 1 ) could not count straight , or 2 ) who had added &; subtracted the wrong things . <P> And finally , the rampaging Institution trampled all over the popular belief of most U.S. citizens that the roaring economy , by giving the U.S. both guns and butter , has led the nation to a new high plateau of prosperity . <P> Said the report gloomily : " The war can not be regarded as a force which will have raised the level of real income . In the absence of the war , we might have had a greater advance in productivity . . . , . The widespread erroneous impression that the war has placed the American people upon a new plateau of national income is due to a failure to take account of the abnormal " current increases in wages , prices and employment . " <P> Paper Profits . Brookings ' 34-page report was prepared by Joseph Mayer , 57 , a slender eyebrow-mustached economist-author ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vice ) . As vith all Brookings reports , it was carefully scanned by bald , pudgy Harold G. Moulton , Institution president , and given a preface by way of approval . <P> Messrs . Moulton and Mayer alleged that the differences in the estimates arose because estimators have confused two different methods of computing national income , and then further garbled their figures by using " unjustifiable methods . " <P> For years economists talked mainly in terms of the net national income ( total of all income of individuals and corporations ) . But in 1942 the Department of Commerce ran a parallel new figure showing the " gross national product . " This was naturally far higher ; it included not only the national income but the " unjustified figures , " such as depreciation reserves . In fact , it measures the value of U.S. production instead of only payments made to produce it . Said Brookings : " A distorted picture of national expansion has been built up in the minds of the public . One not infrequently reads that the national income has increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a net figure ) to a current level of nearly $200 billion ( which is gross ) . "
