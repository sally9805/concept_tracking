Western front correspondents last week were permitted to tell a story three or four weeks old : Supreme Allied Commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower had been a minor casualty . <P> Flying to his headquarters in sticky weather , the General 's light plane had to land on a narrow beach ; helping the pilot drag the plane from the surf 's edge , General Ike wrenched a knee . <P> Last week he still had a stiff leg but , contrary to rumors , was otherwise fit .
