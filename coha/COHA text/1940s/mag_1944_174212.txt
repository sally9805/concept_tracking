When Douglas Rigby was a boy , an adventurous relative brought home some shrunken human heads from Peru . The memory of those heads , he claims , has prevented him from collecting anything himself-except facts about collectors . For the past seven years Douglas Rigby and his wife Elizabeth have been collecting just such facts . The result is a 517-page book , chock-full of photographs and line drawings : Lock , Stock &; Barrel ( Lippincott ; $5 ) , the first such history ever compiled . <P> What prompted Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin to collect owls ? Why do normally intelligent people collect cuspidors , garters , hearses , thimbles ? Very simple , say the Rigbys : collecting is one of the basic instincts-animal as well as human ( the proprietor of a London restaurant spent years blaming souvenir-hunting patrons for the disappearance of napkins ; eventually he discovered that a fat brown rat had built a nest in the wall of the restaurant , there amassed a collection of 1,728 ) . <P> Egypt 's Tutankhamen collected walking sticks ; Hermann Wilhelm Gring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collector is going to collect or why . A woman in Richmond avidly collects toy elephants- for the excellent reason that her name is Mrs. L. E. Fant . The ferocious Ferrante , King of Naples , was fond of collecting his political enemies , whom he had executed , stuffed and mounted , and kept tastefully arrayed in a special room in his palace . <P> Lock , Stock &; Barrel has considerable anecdotal value . It also has an interesting point : collecting is largely responsible for man 's knowledge of himself-through the foundation of libraries and of great artistic and scientific museums .
