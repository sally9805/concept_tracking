txt ON BOARD THE DEWEY SPECIAL TRAIN , En Route to Des Moines , Sept. 10 ? Thomas E. Dewey and his advisers were warned , during their stay in Mr. Dewey 's native State , against overconfidence concerning the November result . Local Republican leaders , it was said today , declared that Michigan would probably go Republican , but that it would take work and money to offset the drive being waged by Abe CIO Political Action CommitI tee . Meanwhile the Dewey party headed westward to the Corn Belt for a day 's stay in Des Moines , after having spent Saturday night and Sunday afternoon in the Governor 's old home town of Owosso , Mich. , at the home of his mother . The Michigan welcome for Mr. Dewey was excellent , both in Lansing and in Owosso , and an even better one can be expected in Des Moines tomorrow . However , where the Des Moines welcome is likely to be representative of the State as a whole ? it is marked about as safely Republican as any State  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in industrial Detroit , , swollen in population by a million war workers . While most of these come from out of the State , a number come I from other parts of Michigan , and I the story Mr. Dewey is reported to ' have been told here is that the rural vote in Michigan will be down this year , due to loss of population , and efforts must be made to neutralize the Detroit vote if Michigan 's nineteen electoral votes are to be kept in the Republican column . The State went for Wendell L. Willkie by a margin of 7,000 votes , 1,039,000 for Mr. Willkie and 1,032,000 for President Roosevelt . It is regarded as probable that Mr. Dewey will come back to De // troit for a speech in October to stress the domestic issues of the campaign . Republicans in Michigan did not appear to be concerned about the Governorship race in which the incumbent , Harry F. Kelly , is opposed by Edward J. Fry , Democrat . The Democratic organization here is not what it was , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though it probably wo n't , this would not extend to the rest of the ticket , the Republicans say . Will Meet Iowa 's Governor In Des Moines tomorrow , Mr. Dewey will , confer with Gov . Bourke B. Hickenlooper of Iowa and will see Republican committeemen and workers in the same kind of conferences he has been having right along , a combination of greeting , pep talK and practical political discussion of the issues that should be stressed in each territory , with emphasis on how the opposition arguments are to be met . He will leave Des Moines tomorrow evening for Valentine , Neb. , where he will spend several days at the ranch of former Gov . Sam R. , for conferences with leaders in the cattle industry , and also to get a rest before he begins his intensive campaigning on the Pacific Coast next week . This morning 's stay in Owosso was an extremely pleasant one for Mr. Dewey . After staying overnight at the home of his mother , Mrs. Annie Dewey , he and his wife drove to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blue suit , and his wife a soft purple dress , with a purple and orchid hat . They sat in a center pew , several rows back from the front , and were officially welcomed from the pulpit by the Rev. William D. Davis , rector of the church , Christ Episcopal . The rector noted that the boy who had once sung in the church boys ' choir had risen to be Governor of New York and Presidential candidate . " We rejoice that you arranged your schedule so that you could visit the church of your childhood at this time , and we extend to you a most cordial welcome , " Dr. Davis said . Dr. Davis kept away from the subject of politics , declaring that while there were many subjects and issues he could discuss , they did not belong in a sermon . Meets Townsfolk at Church When church was over , it took the Deweys more than fifteen minutes to get from their pew to their car , because there were so many who wanted to shake hands and say hello . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name , and many others recalled themselves to him . Mrs. Annie Dewey tried to stay in the background , but an old neighbor , using a box camera , snapped her , to the chagrin of the professional cameramen . The Deweys had dinner at his mother 's home . Other guests were Dr. and Mrs. Harold D. Hutt of Holly , Mich. , and Mrs. Sherwin Welsh of Owosso . Mrs. Welsh is the Governor 's cousin , and Dr. Hutt is Mrs. Thomas E. Dewey 's brother . The menu , it was stated , consisted of roast lamb , roast potatoes , peas , a tossed green salad , homemade apple pie and coffee . Owosso , which had given Mr. Dewey such a turnout on his arrival last night , furnished another crowd on the departure at 3 P. M. today . More than a thousand persons were at the New York Central Railroad Station to wave and see him off . The Governor , wearing a blue suit and a gray homburg hat , waved to the crowd from the rear ' platform of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
