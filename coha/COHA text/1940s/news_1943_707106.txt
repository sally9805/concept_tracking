txt The torture and cold-blooded murder of American fliers unfortunate enough to fall into the hands of the Japanese have sent a wave of horror throughout this country and the whole civilized world . More than anything else that has happened , more than all the stories of murder , rape and other atrocities perpetrated by the Japanese and their Axis partners for now almost a decade in both the Far East and in Europe , more than the tales of savage fighting in the Solomons and in North Africa , more even than Pearl Harbor , it has at last brought home to the American people the full impact and meaning of this war . What neither wholesale murder nor actual warfare , still regarded in this country as a kind of chivalrous contest governed by the rules of sport , could bring about has been brought about by the individual suffering and death of these young Americans . We now know what and whom we are fighting and what must be done to wipe this scourge from the face of the earth . The Japanese , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are doing , obviously staged this bestial deed as a deliberate act of terrorism designed to discourage further air raids on Japan and thereby protect her most vulnerable spot . As usual , arid much like the Nazis , they have again misjudged the outside world , and especially America . For the only results which this crime , as well as their new threats to visit similar " punishment " on fliers captured in the future , has produced are vows of vengeance from every corner of the land and especially from the armed forces . President Roosevelt has already served notice that " the American Government will hold personally and officially responsible for these diabolical crimes all those officers of the Japanese Government who have participated therein , and will in due course bring these officers to justice . " " The American people , " he adds , " are more determined than ever to blot out the shameless militarism of Japan . " This savagery is not a matter of race or pathology , but a matter of indoctrination to which both the Japanese war lords and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has had as its aim a deliberate reversion to savagery in order to reproduce the primitive warrior psychology as the best morale builder for a modern war . The savagery of the Japanese militarists is evidenced throughout their long history and has been revived in recent years by a strong revival of nationalistic Shinto , which inculcates into the Japanese people the ethics and morals of primitive , cruel and treacherous gods , conceived in a primitive ? jungle age , as the ethics and morals to be followed by the entire nation in this twentieth century . In like manner the Nazis have also revived the ethics and morals of the savage gods of the ancient Germanic tribes , and for the same purpose . They openly repudiate all the moral concepts of modern civilization as " soft and decadent , " and pride themselves on their brutality , with which they propose to cow the world into submission . But knowledge is strength , and knowing the enemy we shall also know how to meet him and how to defeat him , until this reversion to- savagery has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
