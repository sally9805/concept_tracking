txt Consumers and business men face increases in the price of many things as a result of President Truman 's abandonment of nearly all economic controls , it developed yesterday . Household appliances , clothing , and electric motors for industry are among the items definitely headed for higher prices . It appeared unlikely , though , that there would be a general lifting of the retail price level for several days at least . Business men said that time would be required for buyers and sellers to adjust themselves to the returned " free " economy . A spurt in the construction of one-family homes was predicted , but the first reaction of apartment builders was to shy away from new work until most of the remaining Government limitations  --  including rent control on new housing and material allocations  --  would also be scrapped . Fight on Inflation Stressed Most of the trade and industry spokesmen who commented on the President 's action said they would try to hold price increases , where necessary , to a minimum . While they were happy over the removal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preventing inflation . Most business spokesmen said they believed that prices in general would rise no more than was required by increased labor costs . Housewives and spokesmen for consumer organizations were more skeptical about prices . Jeanette S. Turner , secretary of the New York City Consumer Council , declared that consumers " must fight against unreasonable prices by refusing to buy until they come down . " " The meat industry tried to take advantage of decontrol by raising prices to the sky , " Miss Turner said . " The housewives of America refused to be victims of that kind of profiteering . They just did n't buy meat . It piled up in butcher shops . It backed up in warehouses , and now prices are coming down . Housewives , and men , too , ' should do the same thing about clothing , appliances , furniture and all the other cost-of-living items as soon as prices go too high . " GE Head Discusses Rises A forecast of what to expect in prices of electrical goods was given by Charles E. Wilson , president of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be increases in lines where prices have not heretofore been adjusted in recognition of the higher prices of materials and labor . There are numerous lines in which goods are now being sold at less than factory cost . " Among such items , said Mr. Wilson , were some major household appliances , industrial control devices , and motors . Noting that General Electric was making an " item by item " review of the cost of all its products , he said : " We will do this on a very disc criminating basis and , to the extent that it is economically sound to do so , we will maintain existing prices wherever possible . " Representatives of the men 's clothing industry said there probably would be " small advances " in prices to equalize labor rates , which were increased a week ago by a week . The Cotton Textile Institute said there already had been an upward movement in textile prices and no further large increase was expected . Some Price Cuts Forecast Retailers are highly sensitive td the threat of a nation-wide buyers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advances to minimums , spokesmen declared . Probabilities that prices may be cut on some inferior4lines in the textile field were admitted. , There has been considerable distribution in the women 's garment field of lines made from inferior fabrics and the public has been avoiding these to k great extent . Cancellations by retailers of large quantities of unwanted garments have been a feature of the fall season 's merchandising activities . Unwanted lines left in manufacturers ' hands well may be of . // fered at cut prices to get rid of them , it was said . Retailers asserted that any gouging attempt by producers would meet immediate dealer opposition because the public would not pay materially higher prices . Jack I. Straus , president of R. H. Macy &; Co. , Inc. , made the following comment : " The end of virtually all price control places many new problems before manufacturers and retailers alike . It transfers great responsibilities from government to them . Prices can either be held in line pending increased production or can skyrocket in an effort to capitalize on a limited supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future economy that prices be stabilized at approximately those prevailing under Government control . Macy 's has and will continue to do its best to keep prices down in conformity with its historical policy . " The Hoover Company of North Canton , Ohio , one of the major makers of vacuum cleaners , announced it would not increase its prices . A spokesman said that it was producing considerably more cleaners than before the war and was increasing production still further to meet demands . Increased production of such scarce building materials as nails , fibre board sheathing and rock lath was foreseen by Otto Hartwig , executive secretary of the Long Island Home Builders Institute . This will speed up construction and will save builders labor and overhead costs even though the materials themselves may be priced higher than the former Of . fice of Price Administration ceilings , he said . " It has been taking us nine to twelve months to finish a house that used to take three months , " said Mr. Hartwig . " We get so far and then we 're held up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fibre board . Then there 's another delay for nails , and then for something I else . All this has been increasing I , the overhead . " Decontrol of prices should end the black market in building materials , Mr. Hartwig said . He said ' that nails that had an Office of Price Administration ceiling price of $5 to $6 a keg had been selling in the black market last June at $20 to $25 . In July , with price controls temporarily off , the price . ranged from $6.50 to $9 , but since the return of ceilings in August nails had reverted to the black market and their price had mounted to $15 and $20 a keg . Price decontrol will induce manufacturers to increase production of low-cost items they had neglected for lack of a profit incentive , Mr. Hartwig said . As an example he cited low-cost furnaces . He asserted that furnace makers had concentrated on costlier models that yielded them a profit but were not , the best buy for an average onefamily home . Resentment of apartment build ' ers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decontrol action was expressed by Max Foley , president of the New York Building Congress .. Mr. Foley said it was unfair to keep control of rent in new buildings while taking the limit off all building costs . Mortimer J. Davis , assistant executive manager of the New York Credit Men 's Association , declared that the public would benefit from decontrol . He predicted a greater supply of merchandise at lower prices , except for a few scarce items . " Under OPA regulations wholesale and manufacturing credit terms and discounts were frozen or fixed because they were considered part of the price of goods , " Mr. Davis said . " This worked hardship on consumers in many instances because more favorable terms of payment or greater . discounts might have permitted distributors or retailers to lower their pric- i . " Credit men said that decontrol would eliminate an immense amount of " paper work " that had added to operating costs . The OPA will go ahead with its plans to collect " millions and millions of dollars " in treble damages from manufacturers and dealers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to Harold N. Cohen , regional OPA enforcement executive . Mr. Cohen said that 5,500 such cases were pending in courts in this five-State region and would be carried through . In acid said , there were several hundred criminal prosecutions pending in Federal and local courts .
