Vichy 's continued surrender of Jews to the Nazis last week brought forth one of the war 's most eloquent documents-a brief pastoral letter from Jules Graud Salige , the semiparalyzed Archbishop of Toulouse . Said the Archbishop in full : <P> " There is a Christian morality , there is a human morality , that impose duties and confer rights . These duties and these rights derive from the very nature of man . They may be violated . No mortal has power to suppress them . <P> " That children , women , men , fathers , mothers should be treated as a wretched herd , that members of the same family should be separated from one another and embarked for unknown destinations , was a sad spectacle reserved for our times to see . <P> " In our diocese moving scenes have been enacted in the camps of No and Recebedon concentration camps from which Jews have been surrendered to the Nazis . These Jews are men , these Jewesses are women ; these aliens are men and women . All is not permissible against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fathers and mothers . They belong to mankind . They are our brethren as are so many others . No Christian can forget that . France , beloved motherland ; France , who preserves in the conscience of all her children traditional respect for the human individual ; chivalrous and generous France , I do not doubt that you are not responsible for these errors . " <P> Promptly Vichy forbade publication of the letter . It was too late . The Archbishop 's denunciation had already been read in hundreds of pulpits . Underground it was sweeping through France .
