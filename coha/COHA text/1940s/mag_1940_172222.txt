There are any number of things which can make publishing an immensely unprofitable business . One big one is to have the cost of paper rise ( many a U. S. publisher felt the pinch when newsprint rose from $42.50 to $50 a ton in 1938 ) . Another is curtailed advertising . A third , most dangerous in the long run , is losing the confidence of the public . Last week British publishers were squeezed in all three directions . <P> Newsprint . The pre-war price of newsprint in Great Britain was 11 55 a ton . Immediately after war began it jumped to 17 . Last week , at 21 108 ( $86 ) , newsprint 's price had almost doubled ( while in the U. S. newsprint still sold for $50 ) . A further rise to 25 had been ordered by the Ministry of Supply for July 1 , but after the invasion of Norway ( two-thirds of Britain 's newsprint came from Scandinavia , the rest from Canada and Newfoundland ) the increase was expected to take effect immediately . <P> Cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voluntary reductions in the size of newspapers . Penny papers , like the Daily Mail and Daily Express , which used to run from 16 to 20 pages , were months ago reduced to twelve , the great twopenny London Times to 16 . By last week all dailies including the Times were down to an average of ten pages , twelve on Sundays . With only a 300,000-ton reserve of newsprint , a ten-week supply of pulp for Britain 's mills , a publishers ' agreement to reduce all papers to six pages was momentarily expected . Newsdealers are no longer permitted to return unsold papers and it is often practically impossible to buy a morning paper unless one has a standing order with a newsdealer . <P> Advertisers . Like editorial space , advertising space has had to be reduced , and premium rates are often charged for advertisements more than two columns wide . Rates were raised some time ago because of higher printing costs . Last week 13 dailies agreed to raise the rates another 25% on May 1 . If advertising does not shrink further , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are turning to billboards . <P> Public Trust . Mass-Observation is an organization founded three years ago in Britain by a young biologist and a young poet . Part social club , part scientific society , its members with the aid of some paid employes conduct on an amateur scale something vaguely resembling FORTUNE 'S survey . They publish their findings in a periodical titled Us . In a recent issue Us reported that " mistrust of the newspapers is a commonplace with every section of the population . " <P> Us found that 44% of Great Britain 's people felt they were not getting all the news ; only 40% were satisfied with what they got . Of these , 4% thought there was too much news : i. e. , too much bad news . Blamed by most Britons was " the Government " or " Mr. Chamberlain . " But whoever was blamed , the press took the consequences . <P> Us pointed to at least 17 newsletters that have sprung up in the last few years ( ten since war began ) , each reflecting the opinions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information . " Biggest now is the King-Hall newsletter ( circulation 52,000 ) .
