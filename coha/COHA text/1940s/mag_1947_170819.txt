The U.S. Department of Agriculture has many vexing problems . Last week it had a stopper : a chinchilla with " the slobbers . " Its front teeth had grown so long that it could not eat . Agriculture experts did what they could , but the sick chinchilla had slobbered too long ; it died of malnutrition . <P> The appeal was the first of its kind , but Agriculture was prepared for more : chinchilla breeding in the U.S. is growing by hops and scurries . Some 2,000 U.S. breeders now own about 30,000 chinchillas . A Manhattan company advertises ( and presumably sells ) mated pairs for $1,500 . So valuable are chinchillas that few except the sick or sterile are killed for their down-soft pelts . Breeders find it more profitable to sell them on the paw . <P> Soft to Touch . Chinchillas are squirrel-sized rodents with wrinkly noses and turned-up tails . They are native to the high , dry , hot &; cold Andes . To protect themselves from the fierce changes in temperature , chinchillas developed a remarkable platinum-grey coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every follicle . So soft is chinchilla fur that a blindfolded person sometimes can not tell when his hand is brushing it . The close-set hairs foil fleas , which can not maneuver through them to blood-bearing strata below . <P> The ancient Incas fully appreciated chinchillas ; they wore the skins and ate the flesh . Sometimes the Incas sheared them like tiny sheep , wove thistledown cloth of their " wool . " In the late 19th Century , a rage for chinchilla swept the world of fashion-and furriers soon swept the Andes bare of the little animals . <P> Hard to Market . In 1923 , a U.S. engineer named M. F. Chapman brought eleven chinchillas to California where they became the progenitors of practically all U.S. chinchillas . They proved not excessively hard to raise . They live on cheap vegetables rather than expensive meat . Unlike mink , they do not tear one another to bits . They have no unpleasant odor nor do they bite the hand that feeds them . In their wild state , the males are monogamous ; but on the fur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female can produce three annual litters of one to five offspring . <P> Chinchilla breeders cherish their charges , sometimes pampering them with special food pellets and air-conditioning systems . But the market is risky . It takes about 150 pelts to make one full-length coat . Until pelts fall far below the present price of live chinchillas , furriers are not interested . Manhattan 's I. J. Fox made up one coat , which it priced at $25,000 . That coat is still unsold , says I. J. Fox : " We got a lot of publicity out of it . You can have it for next to nothing . "
