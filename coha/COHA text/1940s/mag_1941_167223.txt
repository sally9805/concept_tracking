Last week the New York Stock Exchange took one look at the news from the Balkans , another at the news from the Far East , and dived . In a single day 's trading of less than a million shares , prices lost 3.44 points on the Dow-Jones industrials average , reached their lowest level since last June-18 points above the 1938 low , 76 below the 1937 high . Next day they rallied slightly . But Dow Theorists and other dopesters still read the main trend as down . <P> Brokers were not disturbed by their sensitivity to war news ; they worried more about the market 's fundamental weakness , now almost chronic . It has no " supporting power " - no outer ring of semiliquid investors able to ride out the brief news-born squalls . One reason for this weakness : despite the production boom , corporate earnings are not going up in proportion to corporate sales ( see below ) . Another : much Wall Street buying power has been absorbed by the liquidation of Britain 's U. S. securities . For these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bundles from Britain .
