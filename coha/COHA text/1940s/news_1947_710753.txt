txt The news that creation of a Transit Authority to take over and operate the ' municipal lines is being studied in the vicinity of City Hall is good news if it comes to anything . The public , which has watched the backing and filling on the transit-fare question through the years , and particularly in the last few months , will file this latest development in its future book and hope for the best . Authority operation would be the best possible solution of the city 's financial problems it no strings were tied to it . It would divorce the issue from politics in so far as that is possible . It would make mandatory a fare that paid the cost of- the ride . It would free the city of a capital budget burden that is insufferable and lift from the expense budget an increasing transit operating deficit . Experts at the Board of Transportation would have to spend some days , probably , estimating what fare would be needed fully to sustain operation , the present rehabilitation program , all debt service and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are many intangibles , which will make such an estimate  --  even when it is made  --  only a scientific guess . But it seems certain that the fare would have to be at least 10 cents on subway lines and the same or nearly that on surface lines . One of the present intangibles , of course , is labor costs . To install a forty-hour week with present take-home pay would alone call for adding 1 cent to the subway fare . So would a 20-cent-per-hour wage increase . No one knows how much loss of traffic would be suffered under an increased fare , another intangible . As long ago as Oct. 16 , 1946 , the Board ' of Transportation reported to the Board of Estimate that the fare required to make the , city 's transit system self-sustaining would be 10 cents on the rapid transit and 7 cents on surface lines ; that such a fare would carry the debt charges of a rehabilitation program of $250,000,000 , but would not continue to sustain the costs of a construction program of $400,000,000 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present system . So it is evident that a change to Authority operation means a cold plunge requiring courage at City Hall of a degree not yet manifest on the fare question . Perhaps the inexorable facts of dire need for money for social services and better pay for city employes to meet rising living costs will prochi6e that courage . We hope so . The week-end also brought news that there is to be a change of pilot in our transit system , Chairman Gross having tendered his resignation . General Gross is a man of high principle , of courage , of strong opinions . We believe he was wrong in rejecting the O'Dwyer-Davis plan of labor relations . But he was right a good share of the time , and never so right as when he kept hammering away on the necessity for a higher fare that would give us decent subways to ride in . He has taken much abuse from the Transport Workers Union , but he has stood up for the rights of the public and refused to be bullied . We regret that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be easy to find a man of equal strength of character and the railroad experience to replace him .
