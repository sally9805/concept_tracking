Whatever their politics , few Americans would dispute that , as an ambassador of good will , the plain man from Missouri has had few equals . Last week , unassuming Harry Truman was at his best in Brazil . <P> As the Independence circled Rio de Janeiro 's mountain-rimmed harbor , Harry Truman looked down on a city seething with excitement . Streets were bright with welcoming banners . Everywhere there were huge posters of Truman . A special Truman stamp had been printed for the occasion . For days , every band in town had been practicing the Missouri Waltz ( which Truman has grown to hate as Franklin D. Roosevelt grew to hate Home on the Range ) . <P> Paper Blizzards . After landing at Galeao airport , the presidential party was taken across the bay in a Brazilian naval launch . At the Touring Club dock , Harry Truman hopped out briskly , strode up the red-carpeted gangplank to greet Brazil 's President Eurico Caspar Dutra and his wife " Dona Santinha . " Sitting side by side , the two Presidents drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Brazilian soldiery . Cheering crowds lined every inch of the way . Blizzards of paper fell from the taller buildings . Standing up in the car , Harry Truman waved amiably to yells of " Salve ! " <P> Next day he was up early to drive the 45 miles through Rio 's encircling mountains to Petrpolis , where the delegates to the Inter-American Defense Conference awaited him . Truman 's speech was roundly applauded . He made emphatic what Secretary of State Marshall had already indicated , that Latin American economic needs must wait on those of Europe . In fact , Truman told the delegates , he hoped that the American nations , " each according to its ability and in its own manner , " would contribute something themselves . <P> Then he left hurriedly for the trip back to Rio and the Missouri , where he was scheduled to receive 500 delegates and Brazilian notables for luncheon . In the harbor , the fog had closed down and a cold wind was blowing . Many of Brazil 's gayest hats were bedraggled by the time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gangway . Brazilians visibly regretted the lack of wine , but consoled themselves with huge amounts of American coffee . <P> Fog &; Orchids . While the Missouri 's balky loudspeaker system alternately shrilled and roared , Brazil 's Foreign Minister Raul Fernandes told Truman : " You moved the soul of Brazil , and the welcome you received represents the position you have won in the hearts of our people . " <P> The next two days were heavy with fog and rain . The Trumans passed them in relative quiet . With White House Physician Wallace Graham , an orchid fancier , the President clambered 1,000 feet up precipitous Corcovado Mountain behind the American Embassy . They found six orchid plants , one in bloom . Mrs. Truman and Margaret went out shopping , bought handbags , filigree jewelry and carved wooden animals . The President made a surprise appearance at the opera , drew a wild ovation . <P>
