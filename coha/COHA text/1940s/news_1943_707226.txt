txt Revolt in the playing ranks of the Brooklyn Dodgers over the suspension by Manager Leo Durocher of Pitcher Louis ( Bobo ) Newsom threatened to force cancellation of the game with the Pittsburgh Pirates yesterday at Ebbets Field . A minute before game time , however , all except Floyd ( Arky ) Vaughan , third baseman , agreed to play , and the Dodgers trotted out on the field to overwhelm the Pittsburgh club , 23 to 6 . The latest empest in Brooklyn 's swirling baseball fortunes blew up when Vaughan , incensed over Newsom 's punishment , appeared in the door of Durocher 's clubhouse office about a half-hour before the game was to start and , without any introductory remark , said : .. " Here 's another uniform you can have . " The Brooklyn manager , amazed and angry , leaped to his feet and concluded a torrent of remarks by saying : " I do n't know what it 's all about , Arky , but if that 's the way you feel about it , take it off ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works " and that quotations attributed to the manager in an afternoon paper yesterday were " lies . " At this point Durocher , foregoing infield practice , summoned all his players from the field as well as all the newspapermen in the park to have an open meeting and thresh the matter out . Newsom , according to the reporter in question , was suspended because he had tried to make Bob Bragan , second-string catcher , the " goat " for missing a third strike on Elby Fletcher of the Pirates in Friday 's game , an error that scored a run and eventually prevented Bobo from gaining his tenth victory of the year . Durocher , in front of all his players and the writers  --  the reporter who wrote the disputed story was not present ? said the story as printed was false and that the Bragan incident had nothing whatever to do with Newsom 's threeday suspension . Vaughan interrupted , saying " But you said you were suspending Newsom indefinitely and that it would go for the season if you could make it stick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to last much longer . The manager said Newsom " seemed to think he had become Judge Landis , Mr. Baseball himself , " and that Bobo had persistently ignored his instructioins on how certain batsmen should be pitched to . Said Durocher : " The suspension resulted from my questioning him on how he had pitched to Vince DiMaggio yesterday when DiMaggio doubled to left . He said , ' high and inside ' . I told him it was n't far enough inside and he virtually told me I was a liar . Nobody can talk to me like that as long as I 'm managing the club  --  and that goes for all the players . " Joins Two Teammates Dixie Walker was the first player to speak up at the meeting and his attitude was unmistakably in favor of Newsom and Vaughan , especially the latter . " If what was printed in the papers is true , " said Dixie quietly , " here 's another uniform you can have . " " That makes two men , " barked Durocher . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vaughan , " should suffer , and if he 's out , I guess I 'm out , too . " Durocher denied he had suspended Vaughan , although he had remarked to him , following the first altercation , that " you 're suspended , too . " " He quit , " yelled the manager . " He turned in his uniform and told me what I could do with it . I did n't suspend him . " At this point an attendant entered the clubhouse , informing Durocher that the umpires were on the field and it was game time , whereupon Durocher declared : " Well , let 's see if we 've got nine meit to put on the field . If we have n't we 'll just forfeit the game . " Then he started from the top of the line-up , asking each man , before setting down his name , if he wanted to play . Everyone except Vaughan answered affirmatively , but Arky already was in street clothes . He and Newsom watched the game from the right-field stands near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jones that Vaughan was back in uniform and on the bench . Rickey Steps In President Branch Rickey of the Dodgers , who met reporters after the game , said he was responsible for the player getting back into uniform . " I did not discuss with Vaughan the reason for what had happened , " said Rickey . " I did n't think that was the time or place . I merely asked him to do this thing  --  and he did . " Rickey added , when questioned on the point , that " if it seems necessary , I will talk to some players on the club , with Durocher 's full knowledge . If there are any lingering thoughts they may have on this situation , I want to dispel them . " Durocher said that the meeting with his players and the writers would be resumed this morning and that the one who wrote the story of Newsom 's suspension would be present . The reporter involved , when questioned by his colleagues , was positive that he had quoted Durocher accurately . Moreover , Vaughan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story to be essentially accurate .
