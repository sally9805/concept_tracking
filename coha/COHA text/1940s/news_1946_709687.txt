txt MONROE , Ga. , July 26 ? Two young Negroes , one a war veteran . who served in the Pacific , and their wives were lined up last night near a secluded road and shot dead by an unmasked band of twenty white men . Tom Clark , United States Attorney General , said today that he has ordered " a complete investigation " into the slayings by the Civil Rights Section of the Department of Justice . It was the first lynching of more than one person in Georgia since 1918 . Ten Negroes were lynched in Brooks County then . There have been nine instances of multiple lynchings in the State since 1892 . The ghastly details of the multiple lynching were told by Loy Harrison , a well-to-do farmer who was taking the Negroes to his farm and who was held at gun point by the mob . Mr. Harrison had come , to Monroe from his farm to get Roger Malcolm , 27-year-old Negro who had made bond on a charge of stabbing his employer , a white man . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and George Dorsey and his wife . The white man and the four Negroes were en route back home in a car when they were waylaid by the mob . Their questioning indicated they were seeking Malcolm . There was no indication why they also took Dorsey out for execution . The women were killed because one of them recognized a member of the mob . The coroner said that at least sixty bullets were pumped into the bodies of the Negro farm hands and their wives . The grotesquely sprawled bodies were found in a clump of bushes beside a little-used sideroad . Mr. Harrison said the band , led by a " tall , dignified looking white man " lined the Negroes up four abreast , and then to the count of // " one , two , three " by the leader , three volleys were fired into the quartet . " I did n't have anthing but a pocket knife , " Mr. Harrison related . " What could I do ? " Mr. Harrison said " most of the men were dressed in khaki clothes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business man . He was about 65 , wore a brown suit and had on a big broad-brimmed hat . He looked like he had a good Florida suntan . " The hands of the two men were bound behind them . The hands of the women were free . The upper part of the bodies were scarcely recognizable from the mass of bullet holes . The women were sisters . The tragedy occurred about eight miles from here late yesterday , ' but the story did not " leak out " until today . Monroe is forty miles northeast of Atlanta . One of the Negroes was shot in the back and W. T. Brown , the coroner , said that this indicated some member of the mob fired at him , after he fell from the first fusilade . The slaughter came as the aftermath of the stabbing of a white ' man , Barney Hester , twenty-two , a farmer , on July 14 . Mr. Hester is still in a hospital here . Dorsey 's mother , Monia Williams , said that her son had just been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including overseas duty in Australia and North Africa . The Negro men were taken out of the car first and led down the side road . The women were held at the automobile . Then a member of the mob said one of the Negro women had recognized him . " Get those damned women , too , " the mob leader shouted . Several of the men then came back and dragged the shrieking women from the automobile . Then , a few moments later , Mr. Harrison heard the shots  --  many of them . The mob dispersed . The nearest house to the scene was a mile and a half away . Mr. Harrison made his way two miles to a country store and called the Sheriff . The Sheriff , E. S. Gordon , said that since Mr. Harrison could not identify any member of the band he had gone as far as he could with his investigation . He called in State police . The lynching was the first in the nation in nearly a year , and was the first multiple lynching since two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Mississippi mob in October , 1942 . Lynchings have taken a sharp downward curve in the last halfcentury . The all-time high was in 1892 , when 231 were recorded , according to the figures of the Southern Regional Council in Atlanta .
