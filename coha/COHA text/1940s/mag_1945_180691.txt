Not until the stroke of noon on the second day of the conference did Winston Churchill arrive in theater-like Central Hall , Westminster . He made his entrance with the grandeur of royalty . In front , with mincing step , walked Party Chairman Ralph Assheton . Behind came a retinue of Cabinet Ministers . The 2,000 delegates waved agenda sheets in well-bred excitement , burst into a politely modulated For He 's a Jolly Good Fellow . Rosy-cheeked and beaming , in tail coat and striped trousers , " Winnie " waved back . Then he launched into his speech . <P> The scene was the annual conference of the Conservative Party , in London . Over the meeting loomed the prospect of a general election , Britain 's first in ten years , due to follow V-E day . The fact that Winston Churchill had chosen to talk to the Tories as a Tory looked like electioneering , and his speech was definitely that . <P> Foolproof Formula . The speech was one of Churchill 's best : a masterly mixture of lofty patriotism and adroit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We held aloft the flaming torch of free dom when all around the night was black as jet " ) clothed his sturdy Tory form ( " We have endured patiently , almost silently , many provocations from that happily limited class of left-wing politicians to whom party strife is the breath of their nostrils " ) . By the time he reached his glowing peroration , 43 minutes later , the Tory leader had shown how he proposed to win the general election . <P> It sounded like a foolproof formula : " We have to finish the war . We have to bring the men home . We have to get our dear country on the move again and into its full swing of natural health and life . " The Conservatives would promise no " easy , cheap-jack Utopia of airy phrases . . . windy platitudes . " For Britons in &; out of uniform , weary of restriction and regulation , the Party offered " a large release from the necessary bonds and controls which war conditions have imposed . " <P> Said the Prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the largest Party in the existing House of Commons , to arrange for a general election . . . . Should we be successful in the election a very happy burden will fall upon our shoulders . . . . The job has to be finished and I am here to tell you that we must brace ourselves . . . . " Caretaker Coalition . This much was not unexpected , but what set party quid nuncs a-buzzing was Churchill 's next canny pronouncement : " Should it fall to me , as it may do , to form a Government before elections , I shall seek aid not only of Conservatives , but of men of good will of any party or of no party . " In other words , he would invite Labor and the Liberals to maintain the wartime coalition until the elections . Since both Parties have already agreed to secede from the Government on Germany 's fall , they will be weakened if they accept , or be accused of self-interest if they refuse . <P> Liberals , with little to lose , scornfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a bigger stake in the Government , wanted to think it over first . But time was short : clearly the Conservatives were bent on the earliest possible Win-with-Winnie campaign .
