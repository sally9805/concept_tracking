All known deposits were exhausted hundreds of years ago . A friend of mine owns a necklace of sixty beads of about six carats each , intricately carved . Worth eighty or ninety thousand dollars . The Chinese government has a very slightly larger one valued at a hundred and twenty-five thousand . My friend 's necklace was taken in a holdup a few nights ago . I was present , but quite helpless . I had driven my friend to an evening party and later to the Trocadero and we were on our way back to her home from there . A car brushed the left front fender and stopped , as I thought , to apologize . Instead of that it was a very quick and very neat holdup . Either three or four men , I really saw only two , but I 'm sure another stayed in the car behind the wheel , and I thought I saw a glimpse of still a fourth at the rear window . My friend was wearing the jade necklace . They took that and two rings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader looked the things over without any apparent hurry under a small flashlight . Then he handed one of the rings back and said that would give us an idea what kind of people we were dealing with and to wait for a phone call before reporting to the police or the insurance company . So we obeyed their instructions . There 's plenty of that sort of thing going on , of course . You keep the affair to yourself and pay ransom , or you never see your jewels again . l f they 're fully insured , perhaps you do n't mind , but if they happen to be rare pieces , you would rather pay ransom . " I nodded . " And this jade necklace is something that ca n't be picked up every day . " He slid a finger along the polished surface of the piano with a dreamy expression , as if touching smooth things pleased him.  | " Very much so . It 's irreplaceable . She should n't have worn it out  --  ever . But she 's a reckless sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Uh-huh . How much are you paying ? " " Eight thousand dollars . It 's dirt cheap . But if my friend could n't get another like it , these thugs could n't very easily dispose of it either . It 's probably known to every one in the trade , all over the country . "  --  Ibis friend of yours  --  does she have a name ? " " I 'd prefer not to mention it at the moment . " " What are the arrangements ? " I le looked at me along his pale eyes . I thought he seemed a bit scared , but I did n't know him very well . Maybe it was a hangover . The hand that held the dark cigarette could n't keep still . " We have been negotiating by telephone for several clays  --  through me . Everything is settled except the time : an place of meeting . It is to be sometime tonight . I shall presently be getting a call to tell me of that . It will not be very far away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once . I suppose that is so that no plant could be arranged . With the police , I mean . " " Uh-huh . Is the money marked ? I suppose it is money ? " " Currency , of course . Twenty dollar bills . No , why should it be marked ? " " It can be done so that it takes black light to detect it . No reason  --  except that the cops like to break up these gangs  --  if they can get any co-operation . Some of the money might turn up on some lad with a record . " Ile wrinkled his brow thoughtfully . " I 'm afraid I do n't know what black light is . " " Ultra-violet . It makes certain metallic inks glisten in the dark . I could get it done for you . " " I 'm afraid there is n't time for that now , " he said shortly . " That 's one of the things that worries me . " " Why you only called me this afternoon . Why you picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He laughed . His laugh was rather boyish , but not a very young boy . " Well , as a matter of fact I 'll have to confess I merely picked your name at random out of the phone book . You see I had n't intended to have anyone go with me . Then this afternoon I got to thinking why not . " I lit another of my squashed cigarettes and watched his throat muscles . " What 's the plan ? " He spread his hands . " Simply to go where I am told , hand over the package of money , and receive back the jade necklace . " " Uh-huh . " " You seem fond of that expression . " " What expression ? " " Uh-huh . " " Where will I be  --  in the hack of the car ? " " I suppose so . It 's a big car . You could easily hide in the back of it . " " Listen , " I said slowly . You plan to go out with me hidden in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone some time tonight . You will have eight grand in currency on you and with that you are supposed to buy back a jade necklace worth ten or twelve times that much . What you will probably get will be a package you wo n't be allowed to open  --  providing you get anything at all . It 's just as likely they will simply take your money , count it over in some other place , and mail youp53the necklace , if they feel bighearted . There 's nothing to prevent them double-crossing you . Certainly nothing I could do would stop them . These are heist guys . They 're tough . They might even knock you on the head  --  not hard  --  just enough to delay you while they go on their way.  --  " Well , as a matter of fact , I 'm a little afraid of something like that , " he said quietly , and his eyes twitched. " t suppose that 's really why I wanted somebody with me . " Did they put a flash on you when they pulled the stickup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No matter . They 've had a dozen chances to look you over since . They probably knew all about you before that anyway . These jobs are cased . They 're cased the way a dentist cases your tooth for a gold inlay . You go out with this dame much ? " " Well  --  not infrequently , " he said stiffly . " Married ? " " Look here , " he snapped . " Suppose we leave the lady out of this entirely . " " Okey , " I said . " But the more I know the fewer cups I ! teak . I ought to walk away from this job , Marriott . I really ought . If the boys want to play ball , you do n't tined me . If they do n't want to play ball , I ca n't do anything about it . " " All I want is your company , " he said quickly . I shrugged and spread my hands . " Okey  --  but I drive the car and carry the money  --  and you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same height . If there 's any question , we 'll just tell them the truth . Nothing to lose by it . " " No . " He bit his lip.  | " I 'm getting a hundred dollars for doing nothing . If anybody gets conked , it ought to be me . " He frowned and shook his head , but after quite a long time his face cleared slowly and he smiled . " Very well , " he said slowly . " I do n't suppose it mattersmuch . We 'll be together . Would you care for a spot of brandy ? " " Uh-huh . And you might bring me my hundred bucks . I like to feel money . " He moved away like a dancer , his body almost motionlessfrom the waist up . The phone rang as he was on his way out . It was in a little alcove off the living room proper , cut into the balcony . It was n't the call we were thinking about though . He sounded too affectionate . He danced back after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisp twenty-dollar bills . That made it a nice evening  --  so far . The house was very still . Far off there was a sound which might have been beating surf or cars zooming along a highway , or wind in pine trees . It was the sea , of course , breaking far down below . I sat there and listened to it and thought long , careful thoughts . The phone rang four times within the next hour and a half . The big one carne at eight minutes past ten . Marriotttalked briefly , in a very low voice , cradled the instrumentwithout a sound and stood up with a sort of hushed movement . His face looked drawn . He had changed to dark clothes now . He walked silently back into the room and poured himself a stiff drink in a brandy glass . He held it against the light a moment with a queer unhappy smile , swirled it once quickly and tilted his head back to pour it down his throat . " Well  --  we 're all set , Marlowe . Ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening . Where do we go ? " " A place called Purissima Canyon . " " I never heard of it . " " I 'll get a map . " He got one and spread it out quickly and the light blinked in his brassy hair as he bent over it . Then he pointed with his finger . The place was one of the many canyons off the foothill boulevard that turns into town from the coast highway north of Bay City . I had a vague idea where it was , but no more . It seemed to be at the end of a street called Camino de la Costa . " It will be not more than twelve minutes from here , " Marriott said quickly . " We 'd better get moving . We only have twenty minutes to play with . " He handed me a light colored overcoat which made me a fine target . It fitted pretty well . I wore my own hat . I had a gun under my arm , but I had n't told him about that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking in a light nervous voice and dancing on his hands the thick manila envelope with the eight grand in it . " Purissima Canyon has a sort of level shelf at the inner end of it , they say . This is walled off from the road by a white fence of four-by-fours , but you can just squeeze by . A dirt road winds down into a little hollow and we are to wait there without lights . There are no housesaround . " .. We ? " " Well , I mean I '  --  theoretically . " " Oh . " He handed me the manila envelope and I opened it up and looked at what was inside . It was money all right , a huge wad of currency . I did n't count it . I snapped the rubber around again and stuffed the packet down inside my overcoat . It almost caved in a rib . We went to the door and Marriott switched off all the lights . He opened the front door cautiously and peered out at the foggy air . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level and the garage . It was a little foggy , the way it always is down there at night . I had to start up the windshield wiper for a while . The big foreign car drove itself , but I held the wheel for the sake of appearances . For two minutes we figure-Bighted back and forth across the face of the mountain and then popped out right beside the sidewalk cafe . I could understand now why Marriott had told me to walk up the steps . I could have driven about in those curving , twisting streets for hours without making any more yardage than an anglewormin a bait can . On the highway the lights of the streaming cars made an almost solid beam in both directions . The big cornpopperswere rolling north growling as they went and festooned all over with green and yellow overhang lights . Three minutes of that and we turned inland , by a big service station , and wound along the flank of the foothills . It got quiet . There was loneliness and the smell of kelp and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window hung here and there , all by itself , like the last orange . Cars passed , spraying the pavement with cold white light , then growled off into the darkness again . Wisps of fog chased the stars down the sky . Marriott leaned forward from the dark rear seat and said :  | " Those lights off to the right are the Belvedere Beach Club . The next canyon is Las Pulgas and the next after that Purissima . We turn right at the top of the second rise . " His voice was hushed and taut . I grunted and kept on driving . " Keep your head down , " I said over my shoulder . " We may be watched all the way . This car sticks out like spats at an Iowa picnic . Could be the boys do n't like your being twins . " We went down into a hollow at the inward end of a canyon and then up on the high ground and after a little while down again and up again . Then Marriott 's tight voice said in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house with the square turret . Turn beside that . " " You did n't help them pick this place out , did you ? " " Hardly , " he said , and laughed grimly . " I just happen to know these canyons pretty well . " I swung the car to the right past a big corner house with a square white turret topped with round tiles . The headlights sprayed for an instant on a street sign that read : Camino de la Costa . We slid down a broad avenue lined with unfinished electroliers and weed-grown sidewalks . Some realtor 's dream had turned into a hangover there . Crickets chirped and bullfrogs whooped in the darkness behind the overgrown sidewalks . Marriott 's car was that silent . There was a house to a block , then a house to two blocks , then no houses at all . A vague window or two was still lighted , but the people around there seemed to go to bed with the chickens . Then the paved avenue ended abruptly in a dirt road packed as hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dropped slowly downhill between walls of brush . The lights of the Belvedere Beach Club hung in the air to the right and far ahead there was a gleam of moving water . The acrid smell of the sage filled the night . Then a white painted barrier loomed across the dirt road and Marriott spoke at my shoulder again . " I do n't think you can get past it , " he said . " The space does n't look wide enough . " I cut the noiseless motor , dimmed the lights and sat there , listening . Nothing . I switched the lights off altogetherand got out of the car . The crickets stopped chirping . For a little while the silence was so complete that I could hear the sound of tires on the highway at the bot- tom of the cliffs , a mile away . Then one by one the crickets started up again until the night was full of them . " Sit tight . I 'm going down there and have a look see , " I whispered into the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my coat and walked forward . There was more room between the brush and the end of the white barrier than there had seemed to be ' from the car . Someone had hacked the brush away and there were car marks in the dirt . Probably kids going down there to neck on warm nights . I went on past the barrier . The road dropped and curved . Below was darkness and a vague far off sea-sound . And the lights of cars on the highway . I went on . The road ended in a shallowbowl entirely surrounded by brush . It was empty . There seemed to be no way into it but the way I had come . I stood there in the silence and listened . Minute passed slowly after minute , but I kept on waiting for some new sound . None came . I seemed to have that hollow entirely to myself . I looked across to the lighted beach club . From its upper windows a man with a good night glass could probably cover this spot fairly well . He could see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , whether there was ap59group of men or just one . Sitting in a dark room with a good night glass you can see a lot more detail than you would think possible . I turned to go back up the hill . From the base of a bush a cricket chirped loud enough to make me jump . I went on up around the curve and past the white barricade . Still nothing . The black car stood dimly shiningagainst a grayness which was neither darkness nor light . I went over to it and put a foot on the running board beside the driver 's seat . " Looks like a tryout , " I said under my breath , but loud enough for Marriott to hear me from the back of the car . " Just to see if you obey orders . " There was a vague movement behind but he did n't answer . I went on trying to see something besides bushes . Whoever it was had a nice easy shot at the back of my loud . Afterwards I thought I might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that  --  afterwards . " Four minutes , " the voice said . " Five , possibly six . They must have moved quick and quiet . He did n't even let out a yell . " I opened my eyes and looked fuzzily at a cold star . I was lying on my back . I felt sick . The voice said : " It could have been a little longer . Maybe even eight minutes altogether . They must have heels in the brush , right where the car stopped . The guy seared easily . They must have thrown a small light in his face and he passed out  --  just from panic . The pansy . " There was silence . I got up on one knee . Pains shot from the back of my head clear to my ankles.  | " Then one of them got into the car , " the voice said , " and waited for you to come back . The others hid again . They must have figured he would be afraid to come alone . Or something in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the phone . " I balanced myself woozily on the flat of my hands , listening . " Yeah , that was about how it was , " the voice said . It was my voice . I was talking to myself , coming out of it . I was trying to figure the thing out subconsciously . " Shut up , you dimwit , " I said , and stopped talking to myself . Far off the purl of motors , nearer the chirp of crickets , the peculiar long drawn ee-ee-ee of tree frogs . I did n't think I was going to like those sounds any more . I lifted a hand off the ground and tried to shake the sticky sage ooze off it , then ribbed it on the side of my coat . Nice work , for a hundred dollars . The hand jumped at the inside pocket of the overcoat . No manila envelope , naturally . The hand jumped inside my own suit coat . My wallet was still there . I wondered if my hundred was still in it . Probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The gun in the shoulder holster . That was a nice touch . They left me my gun . A nice touch of something or other  --  like closing a man 's eyes after you knife him . I felt the back of my head . My hat was still on . I took it off , not without discomfort and felt the head underneath . Good old head , I 'd had it a long time . It was a little soft now , a little pulpy , and more than a little tender . But a pretty light sapping at that . The hat had helped . I could still use the head . I could use it another year anyway.  |p61I  put my right hand back on the ground and took the left off and swivelled it around until I could see my watch . The illuminated dial showed 10.56 , as nearly as I could focus on it . The call had come at 10.08 . Marriott had talked maybe two minutes . Another four had got us out of the house . Time passes very slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can go through a lot of movements in very few minutes . Is that what I mean ? What the hell do I care what I mean ? Okey , better men than me have meant less . Okey , what I mean is , that would be 10.15 , say . The place was about twelve minutesaway. 10.27 . I get out , walk down in the hollow , spend at the most eight minutes fooling around and come on back up to get my head treated . 10.35 . Give me a minute to fall down and hit the ground with my face . The reason I hit it with my face , I got my chin scraped . I t hurts . It feels scraped . That way I know it 's scraped . No , I ca n't see it . I do n't have to see it . It 's my chin and I know whether it 's scraped or not . Maybe you want to make something of it . Okey , shut up and let me think . What with ? . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been out for twenty minutes . Twenty minutes ' sleep . Just a nice doze . In that time I had muffed a job and lost eight thousand dollars . Well , why not ? In twenty minutes you can sink a battleship , clown three or four planes , hold a double execution . You can die , get married , get fired and find a new job , have a tooth pulled , have your tonsils out . In twenty minutes you can even get up in the morning . You can get a glass of water at a night club  --  maybe . Twenty minutes ' sleep . That 's a long time . Especially on a cold night , out in the open . I began to shiver.  | I was still on my knees . The smell of the sage was beginning to bother me . The sticky ooze from which wild bees get their honey . Honey was sweet , much too sweet . My stomach took a whirl . I clamped my teeth tight and just managed to keep it down my throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I shivered just the same . I got up on one foot , then on both feet , straightened up , wobbling a little . I felt like an amputatedleg . I turned slowly . The car was gone . The dirt road stretched empty , back up the shallow hill towards the paved street , the end of Camino de la Costa . To the left the barrier of white-painted four-by-fours stood out against the darkness . Beyond the low wall of brush the pale glow in the sky would be the lights of Bay City . And over farther to the right and near by were the lights of the Belvedere Club . I went over where the car had stood and got a fountain pen flash unclipped from my pocket and poked the little light down at the ground . The soil was red loam , very hard in dry weather , but the weather was not bone dry . There was a little fog in the air , and enough of the moisturehad settled on the surface of the ground to show where the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tread marks of the heavy ten-ply Vogue tires . I put the light on them and bent over and the pain made my head dizzy . I started to follow the tracks . They went straight ahead for a dozen feet , then swung over to the left . They did n't turn . They went towards the gap at the left hand end of the white barricade . Then I lost them . I went over to the barricade and shone the little light on the brush . Fresh-broken twigs . I went through the gap , on down the curving road . The-ground was still softer here . More marks of the heavy tires . I went onp63clown , rounded the curve and was at the edge of the hollow closed in by brush . It was there all right , the chromium and glossy paint shining a little even in the dark , and the red reflector glass of the tail-lights shining back at the pencil flash . It was there , silent , lightless , all the doors shut . I went towards it slowly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rear doors and put the beam of the flash inside . Empty . The front was empty too . The ignition was off . The key hung in the lock on a thin chain . No torn upholstery , no scarred glass , no blood , no bodies . Everything neat and orderly . I shut the doors and circled the car slowly , looking for a sign and not finding any . A sound froze me . A motor throbbed above the rim of the brush . I did n't jump more than a foot . The flash in my hand went out . A gun slid into my hand all by itself . Then headlight scams tilted up towards the sky , then tilted down again . The motor sounded like a small car . It had that contentedsound that comes with moisture in the air . The lights tilted down still more and got brighter . A car was coming down the curve of the dirt road . It came two-thirds of the way and then stopped . A spotlight clicked on and swung out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went out again . The car came on down the hill . I slipped the gun out of my pocket and crouched behind the motor of Marriott 's car . A small coupe of no particular shape or color slid into the hollow and turned so that its headlights raked the sedan from one end to the other . I got my head down in a hurry . The lights swept above me like a sword . The coupe stopped . The motor died . The headlights died . Silo nce . Then a door opened and a light foot touched the ground . More silence . Even the crickets were silent . Then a beam of light cut the darkness low down , parallel to the ground and only a few inches above it . The beam swept , and there was no way I could get my ankles out of it quickly enough . The beam stopped on my feet . Silence . The beam came up and raked the top of the hood again . Then a laugh . It was a girl 's laugh . Strained , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that place . The white beam shot under the car again and settled on my feet . The voice said , not quite shrilly : " All right , you . Come out of there with your hands up and very damned empty . You 're covered . " I did n't move . The light wavered a little , as though the hand that held it wavered . It swept slowly along the hood once more . The voice stabbed at me again . " Listen , stranger . I 'm holding a ten shot automatic . I can shoot straight . Both your feet are vulnerable . What do you bid ? " " Put it up  --  or I 'll blow it out of your hand ! " I snarled . My voice sounded like somebody tearing slats off a chicken coop . " Oh  --  a hardboiled gentleman . " There was a quaver in the voice , a nice little quaver . Then it hardened again . " Coming out ? I 'll count three . Look at the odds I 'm givingyou  --  twelve fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And ankle bones take years and years to get well and sometimes they never do really  --  " I straightened up slowly and looked into the beam of the flashlight . " I talk too much when I 'm scared too , " I said . " Do n't  --  do n't move another inch ! Who are you ? "  |p65I  moved around the front of the car towards her . When I was six feet from the slim dark figure behind the flash I stopped . The flash glared at me steadily . " You stay right there , " the girl snapped angrily , after I had stopped . " Who are you ? " " Let 's see your gun . " She held it forward into the light . It was pointed at my stomach . It was a little gun , it looked like a small Colt vest pocket automatic . " Oh , that , " I said . " That toy . It does n't either hold ten shots . It holds six . It 's just a little bitty gun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on you for telling a deliberate lie like that . " " Are you crazy ? " " Me ? I 've been sapped by a holdup man . I might be a little goofy . " " Is that  --  is that your car ? " " No . " " Who are you ? " " What were you looking at back there with your spot-light ? " " I get it . You ask the answers . He-man stuff . I was looking at a man . " " Does he have blond hair in waves ? " " Not now , " she said quietly . " He might have had  --  once . " That jarred me . Somehow I had n't expected it . " I did n't see him , " I said lamely . " I was following the tire lurks with a flashlight down the hill . Is he badly hurt ? " I went another step towards her . The little gun jumped at me and the flash held steady . ' Take it easy , " she said quietly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't say anything for a moment . Then I said : " All right , let 's go look at him . " " Let 's stand right here and not move and you tell me who you are and what happened . " The voice was crisp . It was not afraid . It meant what it said . " Marlowe . Philip Marlowe . An investigator . Private . " " That 's who you are  --  if it 's true . Prove it . " " I 'm going to take my wallet out . " " I do n't think so . Just leave your hands where they happen to be . We 'll skip the proof for the time being . What 's your story ? " " This man may not be dead . " " He 's dead all right . With his brains on his face . The story , mister . Make it fast . " " As I said  --  he may not be dead . We 'll go look at him . " I moved one foot forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she snapped . I moved the other foot forward . The flash jumped about a little . I think she took a step back . " You take some awful chances , mister , " she said quietly . " All right , go on ahead and I 'll follow . You look like a sick man . If it had n't been for that  --  " " You 'd have shot me . I 've been sapped . It always makes me a little dark under the eyes . " " A nice sense of humor  --  like a morgue attendant , " she almost wailed . I turned away from the light and immediately it shone on the ground in front of ire . I walked past the little coupe , an ordinary little car , clean and shiny under the misty starlight . I went on , up the dirt road , around the curve . The steps were close behind me and the flashlightguided me . There was no sound anywhere now except our steps and the girl 's breathing . I did n't hear mine.  |p67Halfway  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw his foot . She swung the light . Then I saw all of him . I ought to have seen him as I came down , but I had been bent over , peering at the ground with the fountain pen flash , trying to read tire marks by a light the size of a quarter . " Give me the flash , " I said and reached back . She put it into my hand , without a word . I went down on a knee . The ground felt cold and damp through the cloth . He lay smeared to the ground , on his back , at the base of a bush , in that bag-of-clothes position that always means the same thing . His face was a face I had never seen before . His hair was dark with blood , the beautiful blond ledges were tangled with blood , and some thick grayish ooze , like primeval slime . The girl behind me breathed hard , but she did n't speak . I held the light on his face . He had been beaten to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a frozen gesture , the fingers curled . His overcoat was half heisted under him , as though he had rolled as he fell. is legs were crossed . There was a trickle as black as dirty oil at the corner of his mouth . " I fold the flash on him , " I said , passing it back to her . " If it does n't make you sick . " She took it and held it without a word , as steady as au old homicide veteran . I got my fountain pen flash out again and started to go through his pockets , trying nut to move him . " You should n't do that , " she said tensely . " You Mhonlcl n't touch him until the police come . " " " That 's right , " I said . " And the prowl car boys are not supposed to touch him until the K-car men come and they 're not supposed to touch him until the coroner 's examiner sees him and the photographers have photographedhim and the fingerprint man has taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is liable to take out here ? A couple of hours . " " All right , " she said . " I suppose you 're always right . I guess you must be that kind of person . Somebody must have hated him to smash his head in like that . " " I do n't suppose it was personal , " I growled . " Some people just like to smash heads . " " Seeing that I do n't know what it 's all about , I could n't guess , " she said tartly . I went through his clothes . Ile had loose silver and bills in one trouser pocket , a tooled leather keycase in the other , also a small knife . His left hip pocket yielded a small billfold with more currency , insurance cards , a driver 's license , a couple of receipts . In his coat loose match folders , a gold pencil clipped to a pocket , two thin cambric handkerchiefs as line and white as dry powdered snow . Then the enamel cigarette case from which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were South American , from Montevideo . And in the other inside pocket a second cigarette case I had n't seen before . It was made of embroidered silk , a dragon on each side , a frame of imitation tortoise-shell so thin it was hardly there at all . I tickled the catch open and looked in at three oversized Russian cigarettes under the band of elastic . I pinched one . They felt old and dry and loose . They had hollow mouthpieces . " He smoked the others , " I said over my shoulder . " These must have been for a lady friend . He would be a lad who would have a lot of lady friends . "  |p69The  girl was bent over , breathing on my neck now . " Did n't you know him ? " " I only met him tonight . He hired me for a body-guard . " " Some bodyguard . " I did n't say anything to that . " I 'm sorry , " she almost whispered . " Of course I do n't know the circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I look ? " I passed the embroidered case back to her . " I knew a guy once who smoked jujus , " she said . " Three highballs and three sticks of tea and it took a pipe wrench to get him off the chandelier . " " Hold the light steady . " There was a rustling pause . Then she spoke again . " I 'm sorry . " She handed the case down again and I slipped it back in his pocket . That seemed to be all . All it proved was that he had n't been cleaned out . I stood up and took my wallet out . The five twenties were still in it . " High class boys , " I said . " They only took the large money . The flash was drooping to the ground . I put my wallet away again , clipped my own small flash to my pocket and reached suddenly for the little gun she was still holdingin the same hand with the flashlight . She dropped the flashlight , but I got the gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light . I put it on her face for a moment , then snapped it off . " You did n't have to be rough , " she said , putting her hands down into the pockets of a long rough coat with flaring shoulders . " I did n't think you killed him . " I liked the cool quiet of her voice . I liked her nerve.  | We stood in the darkness , face to face , not saying anything for a moment . I could see the brush and light in the sky . I put the light on her face and she blinked . It was a small neat vibrant face with large eyes . A face with bone under the skin , fine drawn like a Cremona violin . A very nice face . " Your hair 's red , " I said . " You look Irish . " " And my name 's Riordan . So what ? Put that light out . It 's not red , it 's auburn . " I put it out . " What 's your first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me Annie . " " What are you doing around here ? " " Sometimes at night I go riding . Just restless . I live alone . I 'm an orphan . I know all this neighborhood like a book . I just happened to be riding along and noticed a light flickering down in the hollow . It seemed a little cold for young love . And they do n't use lights , do they ? " " I never did . You take some awful chances , Miss Riordan . " " I think I said the same about you . I had a gun . I was n't afraid . There 's no law against going down there . " " Uh-huh . Only the law of self preservation . Here . It 's not my night to be clever . I suppose you have a permit for the gun . " I held it out to her , butt first . She took it and tucked it down into her pocket . " Strange how curious people can be , is n't it ? I write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it ? " " Very damned little . What were you looking for  --  in his pockets ? " " Nothing in particular . I 'm a great guy to snoop around . We had eight thousand dollars to buy back some stolen jewelry for a lady . We got hijacked . Whyp71they killed him I do n't know . He did n't strike me as a fellow who would put up much of a fight . And I did n't hear a fight . I was down in the hollow when he was jumped . He was in the car , up above . We were supposedto drive down into the hollow but there did n't seem to be room for the car without scratching it up . So I went down there on foot and while I was down there they must have stuck him up . Then one of them got into the car and dry-gulched me . I thought he was still in the car , of course . " " That does n't make you so terribly dumb , " she said . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could feel it . But I needed the money . Now I have to go to the cops and eat dirt . Will you drive me to Montemar Vista ? I left my car there . He lived there . " " Sure . But should n't somebody stay with him ? You could take my car  --  or I could go call the cops . " I looked at the dial of my watch . The faintly glowing hands said that it was getting towards midnight . " No . " " Why not ? " " I do n't know why not . I just feel it that way . I 'll - lay it alone . " She said nothing . We went back down the hill and sot into her little car and she started it and jockeyed it around without lights and drove it back up the hill and eased it past the barrier . A block away she sprang the lights on . My head ached . We did n't speak until we came level With the first house on the paved part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink . Why not go back to my house and bow one ? You can phone the law from there . They have to come from West Los Angeles anyway . There 's nothing up here but a fire station . " " Just keep on going down to the coast . I 'll play it solo . " " But why ? I 'm not afraid of them . My story might help you . " " I do n't want any help . I 've got to think . I want to be by myself for a while . " " I  --  okey , " she said . She made a vague sound in her throat and turned on to the boulevard . We came to the service station at the coast highway and turned north to Montemar Vista and the sidewalk cafe there . It was lit up like a luxury liner . The girl pulled over on to the shoulder and I got out and stood holding the door . I fumbled a card out of my wallet and passed it in to her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " Let me know . But do n't call me if it 's brain work . " She tapped the card on the wheel and said slowly : " You 'll find me in the Bay City phone book . 819 TwentyfifthStreet . Come around and pin a putty medal on me for minding my own business . I think you 're still woozy from that crack on the head . " She swung her car swiftly around on the highway and I watched its twin tail-lights fade into the dark . I walked past the arch and the sidewalk cafe into the parking space and got into my car . A bar was right in front of me and I was shaking again . But it seemed smarter to walk into the West Los Angeles police station the way I did twenty minutes later , as cold as a frog and as green as the back of a new dollar bill.  |p73It  was an hour and a half later . The body had been taken away , the ground gone over , and I had told my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us , in the day captain 's room at the West Los Angeles station . The building was quiet except for a drunk in a cell who kept giving the Australian bush call while he waited to go downtown for sunrise court . A hard white light inside a glass reflector shone down on the flat topped table on which were spread the things that had come from Lindsay Marriott 's pockets , things now that seemed as dead and homeless as their owner . The man across the table from me was named Randall and he was from Central Homicide in Los Angeles . He was a thin quiet man of fifty with smooth creamy gray hair , cold eyes , a distant manner . He wore a dark red tie with black spots on it and the spots kept dancing in Front of my eyes . Behind him , beyond the cone of light two beefy men lounged like bodyguards , each of them watching one of my ears . I fumbled a cigarette around in my fingers and lit it and did n't like the taste of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers . I felt about eighty years old and slippingfast . Randall said coldly : " The oftener you tell this story the sillier it sounds . This man Marriott had been negotiatingfor days , no doubt , about this pay-off and thenlust a few hours before the final meeting he calls up a perfect stranger and hires him to go with him as a body-guard . " " ' Tot exactly as a bodyguard , " I said . " I did n't even tell him I had a gun . Just for company . " " Where did he hear of you ? "  | " First he said a mutual friend . Then that he just picked my name out of the book . " Randall poked gently among the stuff on the table and detached a white card with an air of touching somethingnot quite clean . He pushed it along the wood . " He had your card . Your business card . " I glanced at the card . It had come out of his billfold , together with a number of other cards I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Purissima Canyon . It was one of my cards all right . It looked rather dirty at that , for a man like Marriott . There was a round smear across one corner . " Sure , " I said . " I hand those out whenever I get a chance . Naturally . " " Marriott let you carry the money , " Randall said . " Eight thousand dollars . IIe was rather a trusting soul . " I drew on my cigarette and blew the smoke towards the ceiling . The light hurt my eyes . The back of my head ached . " I do n't have the eight thousand dollars , " I said . " Sorry . " " No . You would n't be here , if you had the money . Or would you ? " There was a cold slicer on his face now , but it looked artificial . " I 'd do a lot for eight thousand dollars , " I said . " But if I wanted to kill a man with a sap , I 'd only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the head . " He nodded slightly . One of the dicks behind him spit into the wastebasket . " That 's one of the puzzling features . It looks like anamateur job , but of course it might be meant to look likean amateur job . The money was not Marriott 's , was it ? " " I do n't know . I got the impression not , but that wasp75just an impression . He would n't tell me who the lady in the case was . " " We do n't know anything about Marriott  --  yet , " Randallsaid slowly . " I suppose it 's at least possible he meant to steal the eight thousand himself . " " Huh ? " I felt surprised . I probably looked surprised . Nothing changed in Randall 's smooth face . " Did you count the money ? " " Of course not . He just gave me a package . There was money in it and it looked like a lot . He said it was eight grand . Why would he want to steal it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the scene ? " Randall looked at a corner of the ceiling and drew his mouth down at the corners . He shrugged . " Go back at bit , " he said . " Somebody had stuck up Marriott and a lady and taken this jade necklace and stuff and had later offered to sell it back for what seems like a pretty small amount , in view of its supposed value . Marriott was to handle the payoff . He thought of handlingit alone and we do n't know whether the other parties made a point of that or whether it was mentioned . Usually in cases like that they are rather fussy . But Marriott evidently decided it was all right to have you along . Both of you figured you were dealing with an organized gang and that they would play ball within the limits of their trade . Marriott was scared . That would be natural enough . He wanted company . You were the company . But you are a complete stranger to him , just a name on a card handed to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutual friend . Then at the last minute Marriott decides to have you carry the money and do the talking while he hides in the car . You say that was your idea , but he may have been hop- ing you would suggest it , and if you did n't suggest it , he would have had the idea himself . " " He did n't like the idea at first , " I said . Randall shrugged again . " He pretended not to like the idea  --  but he gave in . So finally he gets a call and off you go to the place he describes . All this is coming from Marriott . None of it is known to you independently . When you get there , there seems to be nobody about . You are supposed to drive down into that hollow , but it does n't look to be room enough for the big car . It was n't , as a matter of fact , because the car was pretty badly scratched on the left side . So you get out and walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait a few minutes , come back to the car and then somebody in the car socks you on the back of the head . Now supposeMarriott wanted that money and wanted to make you the fall guy  --  would n't he have acted just the way he did ? " " It 's a swell theory , " I said . " Marriott socked me , took the money , then he got sorry and beat his brains out , after first burying the money under a bush . " Randall looked at me woodenly . " He had an accompliceof course . Both of you were supposed to be knocked out , and the accomplice would beat it with the money . Only the accomplice double-crossed Marriott by killing him . He did n't have to kill you because you did n't know him . " I looked at him with admiration and ground out my cigarette stub in a wooden tray that had once had a glass lining in it but had n't any more . " It fits the facts  --  so far as we know them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sillier than any other theory we could think up at the moment . " " It does n't fit one fact  --  that I was socked from thep77car , does it ? That would make me suspect Marriott of having socked me  --  other things being equal . Although I did n't suspect him after he was killed . " " The way you were socked fits best of all , " Randall said . " You did n't tell Marriott you had a gun , but he may have seen the bulge under your arm or at least suspectedyou had a gun . In that case he would want to hit you when you suspected nothing . And you would n't suspect anything from the back of the car . " " Okey , " I said . " You win . It 's a good theory , always supposing the money was not Marriott 's and that he wanted to steal it and that he had an accomplice . So his plan is that we both wake up with bumps on our heads and the money is gone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about it . Is that how it ends ? I mean is that how he expected it to end ? It had to look good to him too , did n't it ? " Randall smiled wryly . " I do n't like it myself . I was just trying it out . It fits the facts  --  as far as I know them , which is not far . " " We do n't know enough to even start theorizing , " I said . " Why not assume he was telling the truth and that lie perhaps recognized one of the stick-up men ? " " You say you heard no struggle , no cry ? " " No . But he could have been grabbed quickly , by the throat . Or he could have been too scared to cry out when they jumped him . Say they were watching from the bushes and saw me go down the hill . I went some distance , you know . A good hundred feet . They go over to look into the car and see Marriott . Somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out  --  quietly . Then lie 's sapped down . But something he says , or some way he looks , makes them think he has recognized some-body. "  | " In the dark ? " " Yes , " I said . " It must have been something like that . Some voices stay in your mind . Even in the dark people are recognized . " Randall shook his head . " If this was an organized gang of jewel thieves , they would n't kill without a lot of provocation . " He stopped suddenly and his eyes got a glazed look . He closed his mouth very slowly , very tight . He had an idea . " Hijack , " he said . I nodded . " I think that 's an idea . " " There 's another thing , " he said . " How did you get here ? " " I drove my car . " " Where was your car ? " " Down at Montemar Vista , in the parking lot by the sidewalk cafe . " He looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me suspiciously . The drunk in the cells tried to yodel , but his voice cracked and that discouragedhim . He began to cry . " I walked back to the highway , " I said . " I flagged a car . A girl was driving it alone . She stopped and took me down . " " Some girl , " Randall said . " It was late at night , on a lonely road , and she stopped . " " Yeah . Some of them will do that . I did n't get to know her , but she seemed nice . " I stared at them , knowing they did n't believe me and wondering why I was lying about it . " It was a small car , " I said . " A Chevvy coupe . I did n't get the license number . " " Haw , he did n't get the license number , " one of the dicks said and spat into the wastebasket again . Randall leaned forward and stared at me carefully.  | " If you 're holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make yourself a little publicity , I 'd forget it , Marlowe . I do n't like all the points in your story and I 'm going to give you the night to think it over . Tomorrow I 'll probably ask you for a sworn statement . In the meantime let me give you a tip . This is a murder and a police job and we would n't want your help , even if it was good . All we want from you is facts . Get me ? " " Sure . Can I go home now ? I do n't feel any too well . " " You can go home now . " His eyes were icy . I got up and started towards the door in a dead silence . When I had gone four steps Randall cleared his throat and said carelessly : " Oh , one small point . Did you notice what kind of cigarettes Marriott smoked ? " I turned . " Yes . Brown ones . South American , in a French enamel case . " He leaned forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of junk on the table and then pulled it towards him . " Ever see this one before ? " " Sure . I was just looking at it . " " I mean , earlier this evening . " " I believe I did , " I said . " Lying around somewhere . Why ? " " You did n't search the body ? " " Okey , " I said . " Yes , I looked through his pockets . That was in one of them . I 'm sorry . Just professional curiosity . I did n't disturb anything . After all he was my client . " Randall took hold of the embroidered case with both Lands and opened it . He sat looking into it . It was empty . The three cigarettes were gone.  | I bit hard on my teeth and kept the tired look on my face . It was not easy . " Did you see him smoke a cigarette out of this ? " " No . " Randall nodded coolly . " It 's empty as you see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's a little dust in it . I 'm going to have it examined under a microscope . I 'm not sure , but I have an idea it 's marihuana . " I said : " If he had any of those , I should think he would have smoked a couple tonight . He needed something to cheer him up . " Randall closed the case carefully and pushed it away . " That 's all , " he said . " And keep your nose clean . " I went out . The fog had cleared off outside and the stars were as bright as artificial stars of chromium on a sky of black velvet . I drove fast . I needed a drink badly and the bars were closed . I got up at nine , drank three cups of black coffee , bathed the back of my head with ice-water and read the two morning papers that had been thrown against the apartment door . There was a paragraph and a bit about Moose Malloy , in Part II , but Nulty did n't get his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless it was on the society page . I dressed and ate two soft boiled eggs and drank a fourth cup of coffee and looked myself over in the mirror . I still looked a little shadowy under the eyes . I had the door open to leave when the phone rang . It was Nulty . He sounded mean . " Marlowe ? "  | " Yeah . Did you get him ? " " Oh sure . We got him . " He stopped to snarl . " On the Ventura line , like I said . Boy , did we have fun ! Six foot six , built like a coffer dam , on his way to Frisco to see the Fair . He had five quarts of hooch in the front seat of the rent car , and he was drinking out of another one as he rode along , doing a quiet seventy . All we had to go up against him with was two county cops with guns and blackjacks . " He paused and I turned over a few witty sayings in my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nulty went on : " So he done exercises with the cops and when they was tired enough to go to sleep , he pulled one side off their car , threw the radio into the ditch , opened a fresh bottle of hooch , and went to sleep hisself . After a while the boys snapped out of it and bounced blackjacks off I ) i s head for about ten minutes before he noticed it . 1 hen he began to get sore they got handcuffs on him . It was easy . We got him in the icebox now , drunk driving , drunk in auto , assaulting police officer in performmiceof duty , two counts , malicious damage to official property , attempted escape from custody , assault less than mayhem , disturbing the peace , and parking on a state highway . Fun , ai n't it ? " " What 's the gag ? " I asked . " You did n't tell me all that just to gloat . " " It was the wrong guy , " Nulty said savagely . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he just got through working as a sandhog on the San Jack tunnel . Got a wife and four kids . Boy , is she sore . What you doing on Malloy ? " " Nothing . I have a headache . " " Any time you get a little free time  --  "  | " I do n't think so , " I said . " Thanks just the same . When is the inquest on the nigger coming up ? " " Why bother ? " Nulty sneered , and hung up . I drove down to Hollywood Boulevard and put my car in the parking space beside the building and rode up to my floor . I opened the door of the little reception room which I always left unlocked , in case I had a client and the client wanted to wait . Miss Anne Riordan looked up from a magazine and smiled at me . She was wearing a tobacco brown suit with a highneckedwhite sweater inside it . Her hair by daylight was pure auburn and on it she wore a hat with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could have wrapped the week 's laundry in . She wore it at an angle of approximately forty-five degrees , so that the edge of the brim just missed her shoulder . In spite of that it looked smart . Perhaps because of that . She was about twenty-eight years old . She had a rather narrow forehead of more height than is consideredelegant . Her nose was small and inquisitive , her upper lip a shade too long and her mouth more than a shade too wide . Her eyes were gray-blue with flecks of gold in them . She had a nice smile . She looked as if she had slept well . It was a nice face , a face you get to like . Pretty , but not so pretty that you would have to wear brass knuckles every time you took it out . " I did n't know just what your office hours were , " she said . " So I waited . I gather that your secretary is not here today . " " I do n't have a secretary . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switched on the buzzer that rang on the outer door . " Let 's go into my private thinking parlor. "  |p83She  passed in front of me with a vague scent of very dry sandalwood and stood looking at the five green filingcases , the shabby rust-red rug , the half-dusted furniture , and the not too clean net curtains . " I should think you would want somebody to answer tile phone , " she said . " And once in a while to send your curtains to the cleaners . " " I 'll send them out come St. Swithin 's Day . Have a chair . I might miss a few unimportant jobs . And a lot of leg art . I save money . " " I see , " she said demurely , and placed a large suede bag carefully on the corner of the glass-topped desk . She leaned back and took one of my cigarettes . I burned my finger with a paper match lighting it for her . She blew a fan of smoke and smiled through it . Nice teeth , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me again so soon . How is your head ? " " Poorly . No , I did n't . " " Were the police nice to you ? " " About the way they always are . " " 1 ' in not keeping you from anything important , am I ? " " No . " " All the same I do n't think you 're very pleased to see me .. " I filled a pipe and reached for the packet of paper mat ( Iles . I lit the pipe carefully . She watched that with approval . Pipe smokers were solid men . She was going to be disappointed in me . " I tried to leave you out of it , " I said . " I do n't know wby exactly . It 's no business of mine any more anyw . I ate my dirt last night and banged myself to sleep with a bottle and now it 's a police case : I 've been warned to leave it alone . "  | " The reason you left me out of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't think the police would believe just mere idle curiosity took me down into that hollow last night . They would suspect some guilty reason and hammerat me until I was a wreck . " " How do you know I did n't think the same thing ? " " Cops are just people , " she said irrelevantly . " They start out that way , I 've heard . " " Oh  --  cynical this morning . " She looked around the office with an idle but raking glance . " Do you do pretty well in here ? I mean financially ? I mean , do you make a lot of money  --  with this kind of furniture ? " I grunted . " Or should I try minding my own business and not asking impertinent questions ? " " Would it work , if you tried it ? " " Now we 're both doing it . Tell me , why did you cover up for me last night ? Was it on account of I have reddishhair and a beautiful figure ? " I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said cheerfully . " Would you like to know who that jade necklace belonged to ? " I could feel my face getting stiff . I thought hard but I could n't remember for sure . And then suddenly I could . I had n't said a word to her about a jade necklace . I reached for the matches and relit my pipe . " Not very much , " I said . " Why . " " Because I know . " " Uh-huh . " " What do you do when you get real talkative  --  wiggle your toes ? " " All right , " I growled . " You came here to tell me . Go ahead and tell me. "  |p85Her  blue eyes widened and for a moment I thought they looked a little moist . She took her lower lip between her teeth and held it that way while she stared down at the desk . Then she shrugged and let go of her lip and smiled at me candidly . " Oh I know I 'm just a damned inquisitive wench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in me . My father was a p . His name was Cliff Riordan and he was police chief Bay City for seven years . I suppose that 's what 's the at ter . " I seem to remember . What happened to him ? " " I Ic was fired . It broke his heart . A mob of gamblers railed by a man named Laird Brunette elected themI%es a mayor . So they put Dad in charge of the Bureau Records and Identification , which in Bay City is aboutsize of a tea-bag . So Dad quit and pottered around r a couple of years and then died . And Mother died w after him . So I 've been alone for two years . " " I 'm sorry , " I said . She ground out her cigarette . It had no lipstick on it. " 1'h. of ply reason I 'm boring you with this is that it makes It easy for me to get along with policemen . I suppose I ' gilt to have told you last night . So this morning I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see n. 1 le was a little sore at you at first . " " That 's all right , " I said . " If I had told him the truth all points , he still would n't have believed me . All heII do i s chew one of my ears off . " She looked hurt . I got up and opened the other winThenoise of the traffic from the boulevard camewives , like nausea . I felt lousy . I opened the deep drawer of the desk and got the office bottle out and poured it myself a drink . Miss Riordan watched me with disapproval . I was nop86longer a solid man . She did n't say anything . I drank the drink and put the bottle away again and sat down . " You did n't offer me one , " she said coolly . " Sorry . It 's only eleven o'clock or less . I did n't think you looked the type . " Her eyes crinkled at the corners . " Is that a compli-ment ? " " In my circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't mean anything to her . It did n't mean anything to me either when I thought it over . But the drink made me feel a lot better . She leaned forward and scraped her gloves slowly across the glass of the desk . " You would n't want to hire an assistant , would you ? Not if it only cost you a kind word now and then ? " No . She nodded . " I thought probably you would n't . I 'd better just give you my information and go on home . " I did n't say anything . I lit my pipe again . It makes you look thoughtful when you are not thinking . " First of all , it occurred to me that a jade necklace like that would be a museum piece and would be well known , " she said . I held the match in the air , still burning and watching the flame crawl close to my fingers . Then I blew it out softly and dropped it in the tray and said : " I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No , but Lieutenant Randall did . " " Somebody ought to sew buttons on his face . " " He knew my father . I promised not to tell . " " You 're telling me . " " You knew already , silly . " Her hand suddenly flew up as if it was going to fly to her mouth , but it only rose halfway and then fell back slowly and her eyes widened . It was a good act , but I knew something else about her that spoiled it . " You did know , did n't you ? " She breathed the words , hushedly . " I thought it was diamonds . A bracelet , a pair of earrings , a pendant , three rings , one of the rings with emeralds too . " " Not funny , " she said . " Not even fast . " " Fei Tsui jade . Very rare . Carved beads about sixrats apiece , sixty of them . Worth eighty thousand dol- " " You have such nice brown eyes , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , who does it belong to and how did you find mil ? " " I found out very simply . I thought the best jeweler In town would probably know , so I went and asked the manager of Block 's . I told him I was a writer and wanted to do an article on rare jade  --  you know the line . " " So he believed your red hair and your beautiful figure. , , She flushed clear to the temples . " Well , he told me anyway . It belongs to a rich lady who lives in Bay City , 111 an estate on the canyon . Mrs. Lewin Lockridgeuyle . Her husband is an investment banker or some-:1g , enormously rich , worth about twenty millions . He ! c1 to own a radio station in Beverly Hills , Station K I ) K , and Mrs. Grayle used to work there . He marriedher five years ago . She 's a ravishing blonde . Mr.Grayle is elderly , liverish , stays home and takes calomelwhile Mrs. Grayle goes places and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Block 's , " I said . " He 's a fellow thatphi around . " " Oh , I did n't get all that from him , silly . Just about the necklace . The rest I got from Giddy Gertie Arbo-gast . " I reached into the deep drawer and brought the office bottle up again . " You 're not going to turn out to be one of those drunken detectives , are you ? " she asked anxiously . " Why not ? They always solve their cases and they never even sweat . Get on with the story . " " Giddy Gertie is the society editor of the Chronicle . I 've known him for years . Ile weighs two hundred and wears a Hitler mustache . Ile got out his morgue file on the Grayles . Look . " " She reached into her bag and slid a photograph across the desk , a five-by-three glazed still . It was a blonde . A blonde to make a bishop kick a hole in a stained glass window . She was wearing street clothes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she was a little haughty , but not too much . Whateveryou needed , wherever you happened to be  --  she had it . About thirty years old . I poured a fast drink and burned my throat getting it down . " Take it away , " I said . " I 'll start jumping . " " Why , I got it for you . You 'll want to see her , wo n't you ? " I looked at it again . Then I slid it under the blotter . " How about tonight at eleven ? " " Listen , this is n't just a bunch of gag lines , Mr. Marlowe . I called her up . She 'll see you . On business . " " It may start out that way . " She made an impatient gesture , so I stopped fooling around and got my battle-scarred frown back on my face . " What will she see me about ? " " Her necklace , of course . It was like this . I called her up and had a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but finally I did . Then I gave her the song and dance I had given the nice man at Block 's and it did n't take . She sounded as if she had a hangover . She said something about talking to her secretary , but I managed to keep her on the phone and ask her if it was true she had a Fei Tsui jade necklace . After a while she said , yes . I asked if I might see it . She said , what for ? I said my piece over again and it did n't take any better than the first time . I could hear her yawning and bawling somebody outside the mouthpiece for putting me on . Then I said I was working for Philip Marlowe . She said So what ? ' Just like that . " " Incredible . But all the society dames talk like tramps nowadays . " " I would n't know , " Miss Riordan said sweetly . " Probablysome of them are tramps . So I asked her if she had phone with no extension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the funny thing was she had n't hung p on me . " " She had the jade on her mind and she did n't know hat you were leading up to . And she may have heard ni Randall already . " Miss Riordan shook her head . " No . I called him later and lie did n't know who owned the necklace until I told n. lie was quite surprised that I had found out . " " He 'll get used to you , " I said . " He 'll probably haveWhat then ? " " So I said to Mrs. Grayle : You 'd still like it back , could n't you ? ' Just like that . I did n't know any otherway to say . I had to say something that would jar her aIt did . She gave me another number in a hurry . I called that and I said I 'd like to see her . She seemed surprised . So I had to tell her the story . did n't like it . But she had been wondering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she thought he had gone south with the money or something . So I 'm to see her at two o'clock . Then I 'll tell her about you and how nice and discreet you are and how you would be a good man to help her get it back , if there 's any chance and so on . She 's already interested . " I did n't say anything . I just stared at her . She looked hurt . " What 's the matter ? Did I do right ? " " Ca n't you get it through your head that this is a police case now and that I 've been warned to stay off it ? " " Mrs. Grayle has a perfect right to employ you , if she wants to . " " To do what ? " She snapped and unsnapped her bag impatiently . " Oh my goodness  --  a woman like that  --  with her looks  --  ca n't you see  --  " She stopped and bit her lip . " What kind of man was Marriott ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a pansy . I did n't like him very well . " " Was he a man who would be attractive to women ? " " Some women . Others would want to spit . " " Well , it looks as if he might have been attractive to Mrs. Grayle . She went out with him . " " She probably goes out with a hundred men . There'svery little chance to get the necklace now . " " Why ? " I got up and walked to the end of the office and slapped the wall with the flat of my hand , hard . The clacking typewriter on the other side stopped for a moment , and then went on . I looked down through the open window into the shaft between my building and the Mansion House Hotel . The coffee shop smell was strong enough to build a garage on . I went back to my desk , dropped the bottle of whiskey back into thep91drawer , shut the drawer and sat down again . I lit my pipe for the eighth or ninth time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's grave and honest little face . You could get to like that face a lot . Glamoured up blondes were a dime a dozen , but that was a face that would wear . I smiled at it . " Listen , Anne . Killing Marriott was a dumb mistake . The gang behind this holdup would never pull anything like that . What must have happened was that some gowed-up runt they took along for a gun-holder lost his head . Marriott made a false move and some punk beat him down and it was done so quickly nothing could be done to prevent it . Here is an organized mob with inside information on jewels and the movements of the women that wear them . They ask moderate returns and they would play ball . But here also is a back alleytirder that does n't fit at all . My idea is that whoever id it is a dead man hours ago , with weights on his ales , deep in the Pacific Ocean . And either the jadewent down with him or else they have some idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place wherewill stay for a long time  --  maybe for years before theydare bring it out again . Or , if the gang is big enough , itmay show up on the other side of the world . The eightthousand they asked seems pretty low if they really knewc value of the jade . But it would be hard to sell . I'mre of one thing . They never meant to murder any-body . " Anne Riordan was listening to me with her lips lightly parted and a rapt expression on her face , as if Iv N as looking at the Dalai Lhama . Sin closed her mouth slowly and nodded once . ou't e wonderful , " she said softly . " But you 're nuts . "  | She stood up and gathered her bag to her . " Will you go to see her or wo n't you ? " " Randall ca n't stop me  --  if it comes from her . " " All right . I 'm going to see another society editor and get some more dope on the Grayles if I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would n't she ? " The face framed in auburn hair was wistful . " Who has n't ? " I sneered . " I never had . Not really . " I reached up and shut my mouth with my hand . She gave me a sharp look and moved towards the door . " You 've forgotten something , " I said . She stopped and turned . " What ? " She looked all over the top of the desk . " You know damn well what . " She came back to the desk and leaned across it earnestly . " Why would they kill the man that killed Marriott , if they do n't go in for murder ? " " Because he would be the type that would get picked up sometime and would talk  --  when they took his dope away from him . I mean they wouldn ' t kill a customer . " " What makes you so sure the killer took dope ? " " I 'm not sure . I just said that . Most punks do . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled . " I guess you mean these , " she said and reached quickly into her bag and laid a small tissue bag package on the desk . I reached for it , pulled a rubber band off it carefully and opened up the paper . On it lay three long thick Russian cigarettes with paper mouthpieces . I looked at her and did n't say anything . " I know I should n't have taken them , " she said almost breathlessly . " But I knew they were jujus . They usually come in plain papers but lately around Bay City theyp93have been putting them out like this . I 've seen several . I thought it was kind of mean for the poor man to be found dead with marihuana cigarettes in his pocket . " " You ought to have taken the case too , " I said quietly . " There was dust in it . And it being empty was suspi-cious . " " I could n't  --  with you there . I  --  I almost went back and did . But I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in wrong ? " " No , " I lied . " Why should it ? " " I 'm glad of that , ' she said wistfully . " Why did n't you throw them away ? " She thought about it , her bag clutched to her side , her wide-brimmed absurd hat tilted so that it hid one eye . " I guess it must be because I 'm a cop 's daughter , " she said at last . " You just do n't throw away evidence . " Her smile was frail and guilty and her cheeks were flushed . I shrugged . " Well  --  " the word hung in the air , like smoke in a closed room . Her lips stayed parted after saying it . I I t it hang . The flush on her face deepened . " I 'm horribly sorry . T should n't have done it . " I passed that too . She went very quickly to the door and out . I poked at one of the long Russian cigarettes with a finger , then laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeaked my chair . You just do n't throw away evidence . So they were evidence . Evidence of what ? That a man occasionally smoked a stick of tea , a man who looked as it any touch of the exotic would appeal to him . On the other hand lots of tough guys smoked marihuana , also lots of band musicians and high school kids , and nice girls who had given up trying . American hasheesh . A weed that would grow anywhere . Unlawful to cultivatenow . That meant a lot in a country as big as the U.S.A.I sat there and puffed my pipe and listened to the clacking typewriter behind the wall of my office and the bong-bong of the traffic lights changing on HollywoodBoulevard and spring rustling in the air , like a paper bag blowing along a concrete sidewalk . They were pretty big cigarettes , but a lot of Russians are , and marihuana is a coarse leaf . Indian hemp . Americanhasheesh . Evidence . God , what hats the women wear . My head ached . Nuts . I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one I did n't clean my pipe with , and reached for one of them . That 's what a police chemist would do . Slit one down the middle and examine the stuff under a microscope , to start with . There might just happen to be something unusual about it . Not very likely , but what the hell , he was paid by the month . I slit one down the middle . The mouthpiece part was pretty tough to slit . Okey , I was a tough guy , I slit it anyway . See can you stop me . Out of the mouthpiece shiny segments of rolled thin cardboard partly straightened themselves and had printing on them . I sat up straight and pawed for them . I tried to spread them out on the desk in order , but they slid around on the desk . I grabbed another of the cigarettes and squinted inside the mouthpiece . Then I went to work with the blade of the pocket knife in a different way . I pinched the cigarette down to the place where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you could feel the grain of what was underneath . So I cut the mouthpiece off carefully and then still more carefully cut through the mouthpiecelongways , but only just enough . It opened out and there was another card underneath , rolled up , not touched this time . I spread it out fondly . It was a man 's calling card . Thin pale ivory , just off white . Engraved on that were delicately shaded words . In the lower left hand corner a Stillwood Heights telephone number . In the lower right hand corner the legend , " By Appointment Only . " 1 n the middle , a little larger , but still discreet : " Jules A t l tor . " Below , a little smaller : " Psychic Consultant . " I took hold of the third cigarette . This time , with a lot of difficulty , I teased the card out without cutting anything . It was the same . I put it back where it had been . I looked at my watch , put my pipe in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again to see what time it was . I rolled the two cut cigarettes and the cut card in part of the tissue paper , the one that was complete with card inside in another part of the tissue paper and locked both little packages away in my desk . I sat looking at the card . Jules Amthor , Psychic Consultant , By Appointment Only , Stillwood Heights phone umber , no address . Three like that rolled inside three Sticks of tea , in a Chinese or Japanese silk cigarette case with an imitation tortoise-shell frame , a trade article that might have cost thirty-five to seventy-five cents in any Oriental store , Hooey Phooey Sing  --  Long Sing Tung , ' that kind of place , where a nice-mannered Jap hisses at you , laughing heartily when you say that the Moon of Arabia incense smells like the girls in Frisco Sadie 's back parlor.  | And all this in the pocket of a man who was very dead , and who had another and genuinely expensive cigarette case containing cigarettes which he actually smoked . He must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhapsit had n't belonged to him at all . Perhaps he had picked it up in a hotel lobby . Forgotten he had it on him . Forgotten to turn it in . Jules Amthor , Psychic Consultant . The phone rang and I answered it absently . The voice had the cool hardness of a cop who thinks he is good . It was Randall . He did n't bark . He was the icy type . " So you did n't know who that girl was last night ? And she picked you up on the boulevard and you walked over to there . Nice lying , Marlowe . " " Maybe you have a daughter and you would n't like newscameramen jumping out of bushes and popping flashbulbs in her face . " " You lied to me . " " It was a pleasure .

" " By the way , that was marihuana dust in that funny cigarette case  --  the one with the dragons on it . Sure you did n't see him smoke one out of it ? "  | " Quite sure . In my presence he smoked only the others . But he was n't in my presence all the time . " " I see . Well , that 's all . Remember what I told you last night .

" " You 're doing a lot of talking , " I said , " for a guy that holds cards . " I got the phone hung in my face for that . Okey , the hell with him , let him work at it . I walked around the office a little to cool off , bought myself a short drink , looked at my watch again and did n't see what time it was , and sat down at the desk once more .

He would be an expertin frustrated love affairs , women who slept alone and did n't like it , wandering boys and girls who did n't write home , sell the property now or hold it for another year , will this part hurt me with my public or make me seem more versatile ? Men would sneak in on him too , big strong guys that roared like lions around their offices and were all cold mush under their vests . But mostly it would be women , fat women that panted and thin women that burned , old women that dreamed and young women that thought they might have Electra complexes , women of all sizes , shapes and ages , but with one thing in common  --  money .

I reached for the phone and asked the 0-operator for the Stillwood Heights number . A woman 's voice answered , a dry , husky-sounding foreignvoice : " ' Allo . " " May I talk to Mr. Amthor ? " " Ah no . I regret . I am ver-ry sor-ry . Amthor never speaks upon the telephone . I am bees secretary . Weel I take the message ? " " What 's the address out there ? I want to see him .

" " He weel send a car . " " I have a car of my own . Just give me  --  " " He weel send a car , " the voice said coldly , and the phone clicked in my ear . I looked at my watch once more . It was more than time for lunch . My stomach burned from the last drink . I was n't hungry . I lit a cigarette . It tasted like a plumber 's handkerchief . I nodded across the office at Mr. Rembrandt , then I reached for my hat and went out . I was halfway to the elevator before the thought hit me . It hit me without any reason or sense , like a dropped brick . I stopped and leaned against the marbledwall and pushed my hat around on my head and suddenly I laughed . A girl passing me on the way from the elevators back to her work turned and gave me one of those looks which are supposed to make your spine feel like a run in a stocking . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office and grabbed the phone . I called up a man I knew who worked on the Lot Books of a title company . " Can you find a property by the address alone ? " I asked him . " Sure . We have a cross-index . What is it ? " " 1644 West 54th Place . I 'd like to know a little something about the condition of the title . " " I 'd better call you back . What 's that number ? " He called back in about three minutes . " Get your pencil out , " he said . " It 's Lot 8 of Block 11 of Caraday 's Addition to the Maplewood Tract Number4 . The owner of record , subject to certain things , is Jessie Pierce Florian , widow . " " Yeah . What things ? "  | " Second half taxes , two ten-year street improvement bonds , one storm drain assessment bond also ten year , none of these delinquents , also a first trust deed of $2600 . " " You mean one of those things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice ? " " Not quite that quick , but a lot quicker than a mortgage . There 's nothing unusual about it except the amount . It 's high for that neighborhood , unless it 's a new house . " " It 's a very old house and in bad repair , " I said . " I 'd say fifteen hundred would buy the place . " " Then it 's distinctly unusual , because the refinancing Was ( lone only four years ago . " " Okey , who holds it ? Some investment company ? " " No . An individual . Man named Lindsay Marriott , single man . Okey ? " I forget what I said to him or what thanks I made . They probably sounded like words . I sat there , just staring at the wall . My stomach suddenly felt fine . I was hungry . I went down to the Mansion House Coffee Shop and ate lunch end got my car out of the parking lot next to my building . I drove south and east , towards West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me this time . The block looked just as it had looked the day before . ' The street was empty except for an ice truck , two Fords In driveways , and a swirl of dust going around a corner . 1 drove slowly past No. 1644 and parked farther along and studied the houses on either side of mine . I walked back and stopped in front of it , looking at the tough palm tree and the drab unwatered scrap of lawn . The house seemed empty , but probably was n't . It just had that look . The lonely rocker on the front porch stood just where it had stood yesterday . There was a throwawaypaper on the walk . I picked it up and slapped it against my leg and then I saw the curtain move next door , in the near front window . Old Nosey again . I yawned and tilted my hat down . A sharp nose almost flattened itself against the inside of the glass . White hair above it , and eyes that were just eyes from where I stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I turned in towards her house . I climbed the wooden steps and rang the bell . The door snapped open as if it had been on a spring . She was a tall old bird with a chin like a rabbit . Seen from close her eyes were as sharp as lights on still water . I took my hat off . " Are you the lady who called the police about Mrs. Florian ? " She stared at me coolly and missed nothing about me , probably not even the mole on my right shoulder blade . " I ai n't sayin ' I am , young man , and I ai n't sayin ' I ai n't . Who are you ? " It was a high twangy voice , made for talking over an eight party line . " I 'm a detective . " " Land 's sakes . Why did n't you say so ? What 's she done now ? I ai n't seen a thing and I ai n't missed a minute . Henry done all the goin ' to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of there . " She snapped the screen door unhooked and drew me in . The hall smelled of furniture oil . It had a lot of ( lark furniture that had once been in good style . Stuff with inlaid panels and scollops at the corners . We went into a front room that had cotton lace antimacassars pinned on everything you could stick a pin into . " Say , did n't I see you before ? " she asked suddenly , a note of suspicion crawling around in her voice . " Sure enough I did . You was the man that  --  " " That 's right . And I 'm still a detective . Who 's Henry ? " " Oh , he 's just a little colored boy that goes errands for inc . Well , what you want , young man ? " She patted a clean red and white apron and gave me the beady eye . She clicked her store teeth a couple of times for practice . " Did the officers come here yesterday after they went to Mrs. Florian 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniformed officers , " I said patiently . " Yes , they was here a minute . They did n't know nothing . " " Describe the big man to me  --  the one that had a gun and made you call up . " She described him , with complete accuracy . It was Malloy all right . " What kind of car did he drive ? " " A little car . He could n't hardly get into it . " " ' That 's all you can say ? This man 's a murderer ! " Her mouth gaped , but her eyes were pleased . " Land 's makes , I wish I could tell you , young man . But I never knew much about cars . Murder , eh ? Folks ai n't safe a minute in this town . When I come here twenty-two ' eats ago we did n't lock our doors hardly . Now it'sgangsters and crooked police and politicians fightin ' each other with machine guns , so I 've heard .

" " Thank you very much , Mrs. Morrison . I wo n't trouble you any more now . You 've been very kind and helpful . " I walked out of the room and opened the door . She followed me and cleared her throat and clicked her teeth a couple more times . " What number should I call ? " she asked , relenting a little . " University 4-5000 . Ask for Lieutenant Nulty .

" Yessir , we had a nice fat le once , me and George . Best there was . " I opened the screen door and stepped through it and linked her again . She was smiling now . Her smile us as sharp as her eyes . " Lets a registered letter first of every month , " she said suddenly . I turned and waited . She leaned towards me .

She began to laugh -- a high-pitched old woman 's laugh . " April Fool 's Day , " she tittered . " Maybe she wo n't get it . " I left her laughing . The sound was like a hen having hiccups . Nobody answered my ring or knock next door . I tried again . The screen door was n't hooked . I tried the house door . It was unlocked . I stepped inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gin . There were still no bodies on the floor . A dirty glass stood on the small table beside the chair where Mrs. Florian had sat yesterday . The radio was turned off . I went over to the davenport and felt down behind the cushions . The same dead soldier and another one with him now . I called out . No answer . Then I thought I heard a long slow unhappy breathing that was half groaning . I went through the arch and sneaked into the little hallway . The bedroom door was partly open and the groaningsound came from behind it . I stuck my head in and looked . Mrs. Florian was in bed . She was lying flat on her back with a cotton comforter pulled up to her chin . One of the little fluffballs on the comforter was almost in her mouth . IIer long yellow face was slack , half dead . Her dirty hair straggled on the pillow . Her eyes opened slowly and looked at me with no expression . The room had a sickening smell of sleep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticked on the peeling gray-white paint of the bureau . It ticked loud enough to shake the walls . Above it a mirror showed a distorted view of the woman 's face . The trunk from which she had taken the photos was still open . I said : " Good afternoon , Mrs. Florian . Are you sick ? " She worked her lips together slowly , rubbed one over the other , then slid a tongue out and moistened them and worked her jaws . Her voice came from her mouth sounding like a worn-out phonograph record . Her eyes showed recognition now , but not pleasure . " You get him ? " " The Moose ? " " Sure . " " Not yet . Soon , I hope . " She screwed her eyes up and then snapped them open us if trying to get rid of a film over them . " You ought to keep your house locked up , " I said . " I le might come back .

" Why would I be ? " c ) key , you 're not . What are you afraid of ? " bight snapped into her eyes , held for a moment , and lobed out again . " Aw beat it . You coppers give me an ache in the fanny . " I said nothing . I leaned against the door frame and pit a cigarette in my mouth and tried to jerk it up farp108enough to hit my nose with it .

" " I was with him yesterday  --  when he killed the nigger over on Central .

" I 1 cr eyes blinked rapidly , but nothing else moved .. She stared . " I used to work for him , " she said at last . " I used to a servant in his family . He kind of takes care of me u little . " I took the unlighted cigarette out of my mouth and looked at it aimlessly and stuck it back in . ' Yesterday afternoon , a few hours after I saw you , tr . Marriott called me up at my office . He offered me u job . " " What kind of job ? " Her voice croaked now , badly .. I shrugged . " I ca n't tell you that . Confidential . I wilt to see him last night . " " You 're a clever son of a bitch , " she said thickly and moved a hand under the bedclothes . I stared at her and said nothing. " ( ; upper-smart , " she sneered . I ran a hand up and down the door frame . It felt slimy . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , that 's all , " I said smoothly . " I was just wondering how come . Might be nothing at all . Just a co Incidence . It just looked as if it might mean something . " " c ; upper-smart , " she said emptily . " Not a real copper at that . Just a cheap shamus. "  | " I suppose so , " I said . " Well , good-by , Mrs. Florian . By the way , I do n't think you 'll get a registered letter tomorrow morning . " She threw the bedclothes aside and jerked upright with her eyes blazing . Something glittered in her right hand . A small revolver , a Banker 's Special . It was old and worn , but looked business-like . " Tell it , " she snarled . " Tell it fast . " I looked at the gun and the gun looked at me . Not too steadily . The hand behind it began to shake , but the eyes still blazed . Saliva bubbled at the corners of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . The gun and her jaw dropped at the same time . I was inches from the door . While the gun was still dropping , I slid through it and beyond the opening . " Think it over , " I called back . There was no sound , no sound of any kind . I went fast back through the hall and dining room and out of the house . My back felt queer as I went down the walk . The muscles crawled . Nothing happened . I went along the street and got into my car and drove away from there . The last day of March and hot enough for summer . I felt like taking my coat off as I drove . In front of the 77th Street Station , two prowl car men were scowling at a bent front fender . I went in through the swing doors and found a uniformed lieutenant behind the railing looking over the charge sheet . I asked him if Nulty was upstairs . He said he thought he was , was I a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , go on up , so I went up the worn stairs and along the corridor and knocked at the door . The voice yelled and I went in . He was picking his teeth , sitting in one chair with hisp111feet on the other . He was looking at his left thumb , holding it up in front of his eyes and at arm 's length . The thumb looked all right to me , but Nulty 's stare was gloomy , as if he thought it would n't get well. lie lowered it to his thigh and swung his feet to the floor and looked at me instead of at his thumb . He wore a dark gray suit and a mangled cigar end was waiting on the desk for him to get through with the toothpick. f turned the felt seat cover that lay on the other chair with its straps not fastened to anything , sat down , and put a cigarette in my face . " You , " Nulty said , and looked at his toothpick , to see If it was chewed enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't on it any more . " " Who is ? " " Nobody ai n't . Why ? The guy 's lammed . We got him on the teletype and they got readers out . Hell , he 'll be in Mexico long gone . " " Well , all he did was kill a negro , " I said . " I guess that 's only a misdemeanor . " " You still interested ? I thought you was workin ' ? " HIs pale eyes moved damply over my face . " I had a job last night , but it did n't last . Have you still got that Pierrot photo ? " He reached around and pawed under his blotter . He In-Id it out . It still looked pretty . I stared at the face. his is really mine , " I said . " If you do n't need it for the tile , I 'd like to keep it . " " Should be in the file , I guess , " Nulty said . " I forgot about t it . Okey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file in. " put the photo in my breast pocket and stood up.  | " Well , I guess that 's all , " I said , a little too airily . " I smell something , " Nulty said coldly . I looked at the piece of rope on the edge of his desk . His eyes followed my look . He threw the toothpick on the floor and stuck the chewed cigar in his mouth . " Not this either , " he said . " It 's a vague hunch . If it grows more solid , I wo n't forget you . " " Things is tough . I need a break , pal . " " A man who works as hard as you deserves one , " I said . He struck a match on his thumbnail , looked pleased because it caught the first time , and started inhaling smoke from the cigar . " I 'm laughing , " Nulty said sadly , as I went out . The hall was quiet , the whole building was quiet . Down in front the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I drove back to Hollywood . The phone was ringing as 1 stepped into the office . I leaned down over the desk and said , " Yes ? " " Am I addressing Mr. Philip Marlowe ? " " Yes , this is Marlowe . " " This is Mrs. Grayle 's residence . Mrs. Lewin LockridgeGrayle . Mrs. Grayle would like to see you here as soon as convenient . " " Where ? " " The address is Number 862 Aster Drive , in Bay City . May I say you will arrive within the hour ? " " Are you Mr. Grayle ? " " Certainly not , sir . I am the butler . " " That 's me you hear ringing the door bell , " I said.  |p113It  was close to the ocean and you could feel the ocean in the air but you could n't see water from the front of the place . Aster Drive had a long smooth curve there and the houses on the inland side were just nice houses , hut on the canyon side they were great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gates and ornamental hedges ; and inside , if you could get inside , a special brand of sunshine , very quiet , put up in noiseproofcontainers just for the upper classes . A man in a dark blue Russian tunic and shiny black puttees and flaring breeches stood in the half-open gates . He was a dark , good-looking lad , with plenty of shoulders and shiny smooth hair and the peak on his rakish cap made a soft shadow over his eyes . He had a cigarette in the corner of his mouth and he held his head tilted a little , as if he liked to keep the smoke out of his nose . One hand had a smooth black gauntlet on it and the other was bare . There was a heavy ring on his third finger . There was no number in sight , but this should be 862 . I stopped my car and leaned out and asked him . It took him a long time to answer . He had to look me over very carefully . Also the car I was driving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he carelessly dropped his ungloved hand towards his hip . It was the kind of carelessness that was meant to be noticed . He stopped a couple of feet away from my car and looked me over again . " I 'm looking for the Grayle residence , " I said . " This is it . Nobody in . " " I 'm expected . "  | He nodded . His eyes gleamed like water . " Name ? " " Philip Marlowe . " " Wait there . " He strolled , without hurry , over to the gates and unlocked an iron door set into one of the massive pillars . There was a telephone inside . He spoke briefly into it , snapped the door shut , and came back to me . " You have some identification ? " I let him look at the license on the steering post . " That does n't prove anything , " he said . " How do I know it 's your car ? " I pulled the key out of the ignition and threw the door open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him . He had a nice breath . Haig and Haig at least . " You 've been at the sideboy again , " I said . He smiled . His eyes measured me . I said : " Listen , I 'll talk to the butler over that phone and he 'll know my voice . Will that pass me in or do I have to ride on your back ? " I just work here , " he said softly . " If I did n't  --  " he let the rest hang in the air , and kept on smiling . " You 're a nice lad , " I said and patted his shoulder . " Dartmouth or Dannemora ? " " Christ , " he said . " Why did n't you say you were a cop ? " We both grinned . He waved his hand and I went in through the half open gate . The drive curved and tall molded hedges of dark green completely screened it from the street and from the house . Through a green gate I saw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pulling a piece of weed out of the vast velvet expanse and sneering at it the way Jap gardeners do . Then the tall hedge closed in again and I did n't see anything more for a hundred feet . Then the hedgep115ended in a wide circle in which half a dozen cars were parked . One of them was a small coupe . There were a couple of very nice two-tone Buicks of the latest model , good enough to go for the mail in . There was a black limousine , with dull nickel louvres and hubcaps the size of bicycle wheels . There was a long sport phaeton with the top down . A short very wide all-weather concrete driveway led from these to the side entrance of the house . Off to the left , beyond the parking space there was a sunken garden with a fountain at each of the four corners . The entrance was barred by a wrought-iron gate with a flying Cupid in the middle . There were busts on light pillars and a stone seat with crouching griffins at each end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and a big stone bullfrog sitting on one of the leaves . Still farther a rose colonnade led to a thing like an altar , hedged in at both sides , yet not so completelybut that the sun lay in an arabesque along the steps of the altar . And far over to the left there was a wild garden , not very large , with a sundial in the corner tear an angle of wall that was built to look like a ruin . And there were flowers . There were a million flowers . The house itself was not so much . It was smaller than Buckingham Palace , rather gray for California , and probably had fewer windows than the Chrysler Building . I sneaked over to the side entrance and pressed a bell and somewhere a set of chimes made a deep mellow sound like church bells . A man in a striped vest and gilt buttons opened the door , bowed , took my hat and was through for the day . Behind him in dimness , a man in striped knife-edge pants and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his gray head forward about half an inch and said : " Mr. Marlowe ? If you will come this way , please  --  " We went down a hall . It was a very quiet hall . Not a fly buzzed in it . The floor was covered with Oriental rugs and there were paintings along the walls . We turned a corner and there was more hall . A French window showed a gleam of blue water far off and I remembered almost with a shock that we were near the Pacific Ocean and that this house was on the edge of one of the canyons . The butler reached a door and opened it against voices and stood aside and I went in . It was a nice room with large chesterfields and lounging chairs done in pale yellow leather arranged around a fireplace in front of which , on the glossy but not slippery floor , lay a rug as thin as silk and as old as Aesop 's aunt . A jet of flowers glistened in a corner , another on a low table , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , space , coziness , a dash of the very modern and a dash of the very old , and three people sitting in a sudden silence watching me cross the floor . One of them was Anne Riordan , looking just as I had seen her last , except that she was holding a glass of amber fluid in her hand . One was a tall thin sad-faced man with a stony chin and deep eyes and no color in his face but an unhealthy yellow . IIe was a good sixty , or rather a bad sixty . Ile wore a dark business suit , a red carnation , and looked subdued . The third was the blonde . She was dressed to go out , in a pale greenish blue . I did n't pay much attention to her clothes . They were what the guy designed for her and she would go to the right man . The effect was to make her look very young and to make her lapis lazulip117eyes look very blue . Her hair was of the gold of old paintings and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had a full set of curves which nobody had been able to improve on . The dress was rather plain except for a clasp of diamonds at the throat . Her hands were not small , but they had shape , and the nails were the usual jarring note  --  almost magenta . She was giving me one of her smiles . She looked as if she smiled easily , but her eyes had a still look , as if they thought slowly and carefully . And her mouth was sensual . " So nice of you to come , " she said . " This is my husband . Mix Mr. Marlowe a drink , honey . " Mr. Grayle shook hands with me . His hand was cold and a little moist . His eyes were sad . He mixed a Scotch and soda and handed it to me . Then he sat down in a corner and was silent . I drank half of the drink and grinned at Miss Riordan . She looked at me with a sort of absent expression , as if she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything for us ? " the blonde asked slowly , looking down into her glass . " If you think you can , I 'd be delighted . But the loss is rather small , compared with having any more fuss with gangsters and awful people . " " I do n't know very much about it really , " I said . " Oh , I hope you can . " She gave me a smile I could feel in my hip pocket . I drank the other half of my drink . I began to feel rested . Mrs. Grayle rang a bell set into the arm of the leather chesterfield and a footman came in . She half printed to the tray . He looked around and mixed two drinks . Miss Riordan was still playing cute with the ' tame one and apparently Mr. Grayle did n't drink . The footman went out.  | Mrs. Grayle and I held our glasses . Mrs. Grayle crossed her legs , a little carelessly . " I do n't know whether I can do anything , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ? " " I 'm sure you can . " She gave me another smile . " How far did Lin Marriott take you into his confidence ? " She looked sideways at Miss Riordan . Miss Riordan just could n't catch the look . She kept right on sitting . She looked sideways the other way . Mrs. Grayle looked at her husband . " Do you have to bother with this , honey ? " Mr. Grayle stood up and said he was very glad to have met me and that he would go and lie down for a while . He did n't feel very well . IIe hoped I would excusehim . He was so polite I wanted to carry him out of the room just to show my appreciation . He left . He closed the door softly , as if he was afraid to wake a sleeper . Mrs. Grayle looked at the door for a moment and then put the smile back on her face and looked at me . " Miss Riordan is in your complete confidence , of course . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She happens to know about this case  --  what there is to know . " " Yes . " She drank a sip or two , then finished her glass at a swallow and set it aside . " To hell with this polite drinking , " she said suddenly . " Let 's get together on this . You 're a very good-looking man to be in your sort of racket . " " It 's a smelly business , " I said . " I did n't quite mean that . Is there any money in it  --  or is that impertinent ? " " There 's not much money in it . There 's a lot of grief.  |p119But  there 's a lot of fun too . And there 's always a chance of a big case . " " How does one get to be a private detective ? You do n't mind my sizing you up a little ? And push that table over here , will you ? So I can reach the drinks . " I got up and pushed the huge silver tray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She made two more drinks . I still had half of my second . " Most of us are ex-cops , " I said . " I worked for the 1 ) . A. for a while . I got fired . " She smiled nicely . " Not for incompetence , I 'm sure . " " No , for talking back . Have you had any more phone calls ? " " Well  --  " She looked at Anne Riordan . She waited . lcr look said things . Anne Riordan stood up . She carried her glass , still full , over to the tray and set it down . " You probably wo n't run short , " she said . " But if you do  --  and thanks very much for talking to me , Mrs. Grayle . I wo n't use anything . You have my word for it . " " Heavens , you 're not leaving , " Mrs. Grayle said with her smile . Anne Riordan took her lower lip between her teeth and held it there for a moment as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spit it out or leave it on a while longer . " Sorry , afraid I 'll have to . I do n't work for Mr. Marlowe , you know . Just a friend . Good-by , Mrs. Grayle . " The blonde gleamed at her . " I hope you 'll drop in again soon . Any time . " She pressed the bell twice . That got the butler . He held the door open . Miss Riordan went out quickly and the door closed . For quite a while after it closed , Mrs. Grayle stared at it with a faint smile . " It 's much better this way , don't you think ? " she said after an interval of silence . I nodded . " You 're probably wondering how she knows so much if she 's just a friend , " I said . " She 's a curious little girl . Some of it she dug out herself , like who you were and who owned the jade necklace . Some of it just happened . She came by last night to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She happened to see a light and came down there . " " Oh . " Mrs. Grayle lifted a glass quickly and made a face . " It 's horrible to think of . Poor Lin . He was rather a heel . Most of one 's friends are . But to die like that is awful . " She shuddered . IIcr eyes got large and dark . " So it 's all right about Miss Riordan . She wo n't talk . Her father was chief of police here for a long time , " I said . " Yes . So she told me . You 're not drinking . " " I 'm doing what I call drinking . " " You and I should get along . Did Lin  --  Mr. Marriott  --  tell you how the hold-up happened ? " " Between here and the Trocadero somewhere . He did n't say exactly . Three or four men . " She nodded her golden gleaming head . " Yes . You know there was something rather funny about that holdup . They gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , too . " " He told me that . " " Then again I hardly ever wore the jade . After all , it 's a museum piece , probably not many like it in the world , a very rare type of jade . Yet they snapped at it . I would n't expect them to think it had any value much , would you ? " " They 'd know you would n't wear it otherwise . Who knew about its value ? " She thought . It was nice to watch her thinking . Shep121still had her legs crossed , and still carelessly . " All sorts of people , I suppose . " " But they did n't know you would be wearing it that night ? Who knew that ? " She shrugged her pale blue shoulders . I tried to keep my eyes where they belonged . " My maid . But she 's had a hundred chances . And I trust her  --  " " Why ? " " I do n't know . I just trust some people . I trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her face got a little hard . Her eyes a little watchful " Not in some things . In others , yes . There are degrees . " She had a nice way of talking , cool , half-cynical , and yet not hard-boiled . She rounded her words well . " All right  --  besides the maid . The chauffeur ? " She shook her head , no . " Lin drove me that night , in his own car . I do n't think George was around at all . Was n't it Thursday ? " " I was n't there . Marriott said four or five days before In telling me about it . Thursday would have been an even week from last night . " " Well , it was Thursday . " She reached for my glass and ' Irr fingers touched mine a little , and were soft to the ' melt . " George gets Thursday evening off . That 's the Usual day , you know . " She poured a fat slug of mellowlooking Scotch into my glass and squirted in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can drink fur ewer and all you do is get reckless . She gave herself the same treatment . " Lin told you my name ? " she asked softly , the eyes still watchful . " I to was careful not to . " " Then he probably misled you a little about the time . Jp122Let 's see what we have . Maid and chauffeur out . Out of consideration as accomplices , I mean . " " They 're not out by me . " " Well , at least I 'm trying , " she laughed . " Then there 's Newton , the butler . He might have seen it on my neck that night . But it hangs down rather low and I was wearing a white fox evening wrap ; no , I do n't think he could have seen it . " " I bet you looked a dream , " I said . " You 're not getting a little tight , are you ? " " I 've been known to be soberer . " She put her head back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only known four women in my life who could do that and still look beautiful . She was one of them . " Newton is okey , " I said . " His type do n't run with hoodlums . That 's just guessing , though . How about the footman ? " She thought and remembered , then shook her head . " He did n't see me . " " Anybody ask you to wear the jade ? " Her eyes instantly got more guarded . " You 're not foolingme a damn bit , " she said . She reached for my glass to refill it . I let her have it , even though it still had an inch to go . I studied the lovely lines of her neck . When she had filled the glasses and we were playing with them again I said , " Let 's get the record straight and then I 'll tell you something . Describe the evening . " She looked at her wrist watch , drawing a full length sleeve back to do it . " I ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her eyes flashed at that . I liked them that way.  | " There 's such a thing as being just a little too frank , " she said . " Not in my business . Describe the evening . Or have me thrown out on my ear . One or the other . Make your lovely mind up . " " You 'd better sit over here beside me . " " I 've been thinking that a long time , " I said . " Ever since you crossed your legs , to be exact . " She pulled her dress down . " These damn things are always up around your neck . " I sat beside her on the yellow leather chesterfield . " Are n't you a pretty fast worker ? " she asked quietly . I did n't answer her . " Do you do much of this sort of thing ? " she asked with a sidelong look . " Practically none . I 'm a Tibetan monk , in my spare time . " " Only you do n't have any spare time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Let 's get what 's left of our minds  --  or mine  --  on the problem . How much are you going to pay me ? " " Oh , that 's the problem . I thought you were going to get my necklace back . Or try to . " " I have to work in my own way . This way . " I took  --  long drink and it nearly stood me on my head . I swalloweda little air . " And investigate a murder , " I said . " ' That has nothing to do with it . I mean that 's a police all air , is n't it ? " " Yeah  --  only the poor guy paid me a hundred bucks to take care of him  --  and I did n't . Makes me feel guilty . Makes me want to cry . Shall I cry ? " " I Iave a drink . " She poured us some more Scotch . Itp124did n't seem to affect her any more than water affects Boulder Dam . " Well , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold my glass so that the whiskey would stay inside it . " No maid , no chauffeur , no butler , no footman . We 'll be doingour own laundry next . How did the holdup happen ? Your version might have a few details Marriott did n't give me . " She leaned forward and cupped her chin in her hand . She looked serious without looking silly-serious . " We went to a party in Brentwood Heights . Then Lin suggested we run over to the Troc for a few drinks and a few dances . So we did . They were doing some work on Sunset and it was very dusty . So coming back Lin dropped down to Santa Monica . That took us past a shabby looking hotel called the Hotel Indio , which I happened to notice for some silly meaningless reason . Across the street from it was a beer joint and a car was parked in front of that . " " Only one car  --  in front of a beer joint ? " " Yes . Only one . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started up and followed us and of course I thought nothing of that either . There was no reason to . Then before we got to where Santa Monica turns into Arguello Boulevard , Lin said , Let 's go over the other road ' and turned up some curving residential street . Then all of a sudden a car rushed by us and grazed the fender and then pulled over to stop . A man in an overcoat and scarf and hat low on his face came back to apologize . It was a white scarf bunched out and it drew my eyes . It was about all I really saw of him except that he was tall and thin . As soon as he got close  --  and I remembered afterwardsthat he did n't walk in our headlights at all  --  " " That 's natural . Nobody likes to look into headlights.  |p125Have  a drink . My treat this time . " She was leaning forward , her fine eyebrows  --  not daubs of paint  --  drawn together in a frown of thought . I made two drinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got close to the side where Lin was sitting he jerked the scarf up over his nose and a gun was shining at us . Stick-up , ' he said . Be very quiet and everything will be jake . ' Then another man came over on the other side . " " In Beverly Hills , " I said , " the best policed four square miles in California . " She shrugged . " It happened just the same . They asked for my jewelry and bag . The man with the scarf did . The one on my side never spoke at all . I passed the things across Lin and the man gave me back my bag and one ring . He said to hold off calling the police and insurance people for a while . They would make us a nice smooth easy deal . He said they found it easier to work on a straight percentage . He seemed to have all the time in the world . He said they could work through the insurancepeople , if they had to , but that meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He sounded like a man with some education . " " It might have been Dressed-Up Eddie , " I said . " Only l i e got bumped off in Chicago . " She shrugged . We had a drink . She went on . " ' Then they left and we went home and I told Lin to keep quiet about it . The next day I got a call . We have two phones , one with extensions and one in my bedroom with no extensions . The call was on this . It 's not listed , of course . " I nodded . " They can buy the number for a few dollars . It 's done all the time . Some movie people have to change their numbers every month . "  | We had a drink . " I told the man calling to take it up with Lin and he would represent me and if they were not too unreasonable , we might deal . He said okey , and from then on I guess they just stalled long enough to watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we agreed on eight thousand dollarsand so forth . " " Could you recognize any of them ? " " Of course not . " " Randall know all this ? " " Of course . Do we have to talk about it any more ? It bores me . " She gave me the lovely smile . " Did he make any comment ? " She yawned . " Probably . I forget . " I sat with my empty glass in my hand and thought . She took it away from me and started to fill it again . I took the refilled glass out of her hand and transferred it to my left and took hold of her left hand with my right . It felt smooth and soft and warm and comforting . It squeezed mine . The muscles in it were strong . She was a well built woman , and no paper flower . " I think he had an idea , " she said . " But he did n't say what it was . " " Anybody would have an idea out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head slowly and looked at me . Then she nodded . " You ca n't miss it , can you ? " " How long have you known him ? " " Oh , years . He used to be an announcer at the station my husband owned . KFDK . That 's where I met him . That 's where I met my husband too . " " I knew that . But Marriott lived as if he had money . Not riches , but comfortable money . " " He came into some and quit radio business . "  | " Do you know for a fact he came into money  --  or was that just something he said ? " She shrugged . She squeezed my hand . " Or it may not have been very much money and he may have gone through it pretty fast , " I squeezed her hand back . " Did he borrow from you ? " " You 're a little old-fashioned , are n't you ? " She looked down at the hand I was holding . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps me half-sober . Not that I 'd have to be drunk  --  " " Yes . " She drew her hand out of mine and rubbed it . " You must have quite a clutch  --  in your spare time . Lin Marriott was a highclass blackmailer , of course . That 's obvious . He lived on women . " He had something on you ? " " Should I tell you ? " " I t probably would n't be wise . " She laughed . " I will , anyhow . I got a little tight at his house once and passed out . I seldom do . He took some photos of me  --  with my clothes up to my neck . " " ' The dirty dog , " I said . " Have you got any of them handy ? " She slapped my wrist . She said softly : " What 's your name ? " " I ' 1111 . What 's yours ? " " I lelen . Kiss me . " She fell softly across my lap and I bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She worked her eyelashesand made butterfly kisses on my cheeks . When Ito her mouth it was half open and burning and hertongue was a darting snake between her teeth . The door opened and Mr. Grayle stepped quietly into die mom . I was holding her and did n't have a chance to let go . I lifted my face and looked at him . I felt as cold as Finnegan 's feet , the day they buried him . The blonde in my arms did n't move , did n't even close her lips . She had a half-dreamy , half-sarcastic expression on her face . Mr. Grayle cleared his throat slightly and said : " I beg your pardon , I 'm sure , " and went quietly out of the room . There was an infinite sadness in his eyes . I pushed her away and stood up and got my handkerchiefout and mopped my face . She lay as I had left her , half sideways along the davenport , the skin showing in a generous sweep above one stocking . " Who was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Forget him . " I went away from her and sat down in the chair I had sat in when I first came into the room . After a moment she straightened herself out and sat up and looked at me steadily . " It 's all right . He understands . What the hell can he expect ? " " I guess he knows . " " Well , I tell you it 's all right . Is n't that enough ? He 's a sick man . What the hell  --  " " Do n't go shrill on inc . I do n't like shrill women . " She opened a bag lying beside her and took out a small handkerchief and wiped her lips , then looked at her face in a mirror . " I guess you 're right , " she said . " Just too much Scotch . Tonight at the Belvedere Club . Ten o'clock . " She was n't looking at me . Her breath was fast . " Is that a good place ? " " Laird Brunette owns it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right , " I said . I was still cold . I felt nasty , as if I had picked a poor man 's pocket . She got a lipstick out and touched her lips very lightly and then looked at me along her eyes . She tossed the mirror . I caught it and looked at my face . I worked at it with my handkerchief and stood up to give her back the mirror. mirror . She was leaning back , showing all her throat , looking at me lazily down her eyes . " What 's the matter ? " " Nothing . Ten o'clock at the Belvedere Club . Do n't be too magnificent . All I have is a dinner suit . In the bar ? " She nodded , her eyes still lazy . I went across the room and out , without looking back . The footman met me in the hall and gave me my hat , looking like the Great Stone Face . I walked down the curving driveway and lost myself in Ilse shadow of the tall trimmed hedges and came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , a husky in plainclothes , an obvious bodyguard . He let me out with a nod . A horn tooted . Miss Riordan 's coupe was drawn up behind my car . I went over there and looked in at her . She looked cool and sarcastic . Shea sat there with her hands on the wheel , gloved and ohm . She smiled . " I waited . I suppose it was none of my business . What did you think of her ? " " I bet she snaps a mean garter . "   " Do you always have to say things like that ? " She flushed bitterly . " Sometimes I hate men . Old men , young men , football players , opera tenors , smart millionaires , beautiful men who are gigolos and almost-heels who are  --  private detectives . " I grinned at her sadly . " I know I talk too smart . It 's in the air nowadays . Who told you he was a gigolo ? " " Who ? " " Do n't be obtuse . Marriott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm sorry . I do n't mean to be nasty . I guess you can snap her garter any time you want to , without much of a struggle . But there 's one thing you can be sure of  --  you 're a late corner to the show . " The wide curving street dozed peacefully in the sun . A beautifully painted panel truck slid noiselessly to a stop before a house across the street , then backed a little and went up the driveway to a side entrance . On the side of the panel truck was painted the legend : " Bay City InfantService . " Anne Riordan leaned towards me , her gray-blue eyes hurt and clouded . Her slightly too long upper lip pouted and then pressed back against her teeth . She made a sharp little sound with her breath . " Probably you 'd like me to mind my own business , is that it ? And not have ideas you do n't have first . I thought I was helping a little . " " I do n't need any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's nothing I can do for Mrs. Grayle . She has a yarn about a beer parlor where a car started from and followed them , but what does that amount to ? It was a crummy dive on Santa Monica . This was a high class mob . There was somebody in it that could even tell Fei Tsui jade when he saw it . "   " If he was n't tipped off . " " There 's that too , " I said , and fumbled a cigarette out of a package . " Either way there 's nothing for me in it . " " Not even about psychics ? " I stared rather blankly . " Psychics ? " " My God , " she said softly . " And I thought you were a detective . " " There 's a hush on part of this , " I said . " I 've got to watch my step . This Grayle packs a lot of dough in his pants . And law is where you buy it in this town . Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build-up , no newspaper handout , no chance for the innocent stranger to step in with the trifling clue that turns out to be all important . Nothing but silence and warnings to me to lay off . I do n't like it at all . " " You got most of the lipstick off , " Anne Riordan said . " I mentioned psychics . Well , good-by . It was nice to know you  --  in a way . " She pressed her starter button and jammed her gears in and was gone in a swirl of dust . I watched her go . When she was gone I looked across the street . The man from the panel truck that said Ray City Infant Service came out of the side door of the house dressed in a uniform so white and stiff and gleamingthat it made me feel clean just to look at it . He was carrying a carton of some sort . He got into his panel truck and drove away . I figured he had just changed a diaper . I got into my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was almost five . The Scotch , as good enough Scotch will , stayed with Inc all the way back to Hollywood . I took the red lights as they came . " There 's a nice little girl , " I told myself out loud , in the car , " for a guy that 's interested in a nice little girl . " Nobodysaid anything . " But I 'm not , " I said . Nobody said anything to that either . " Ten o'clock at the Belvedere Club , " I said . Somebody said : " Phooey . " It sounded like my voice . It was a quarter to six when I reached my office again . The building was very quiet . The typewriter beyond the party wall was stilled . I lit a pipe and sat down to wait . The Indian smelled . Ile smelled clear across the little reception room when the buzzer sounded and I opened the door between to see who it was . He stood just insidethe corridor door looking as if he had been cast in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and he had a big chest . He looked like a bum . He wore a brown suit of which the coat was too small for his shoulders and his trousers were probably a little tight under the armpits . His hat was at least two sizes too small and had been perspired in freely by somebody it fitted better than it fitted him . IIe wore it about where a house wears a wind vane . His collar had the snug fit of a horse-collar and was of about the same shade of dirty brown . A tie dangled outside his buttoned jacket , a black tie which had been tied with a pair of pliers in a knot the size of a pea . Around his bare and magnificent throat , above the dirty collar , he wore a wide piece of black ribbon , like an old woman trying to freshen up her neck . He had a big flat face and a highbridged fleshy nose that looked as hard as the prow of a cruiser . He had lid-P133less eyes , drooping jowls , the shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a chimpanzee . I found out later that they were only short . If he had been cleaned up a little and dressed in a white nightgown , he would have looked like a very wicked Roman senator . His smell was the earthy smell of primitive man , and not the slimy dirt of cities . " Huh , " he said . " Come quick . Come now . " I backed into my office and wiggled my finger at him unel lie followed me making as much noise as a fly makes walking on the wall . I sat down behind my desk and squeaked my swivel chair professionally and pointed to the customer 's chair on the other side . He did n't sit down . His small black eyes were hostile . " Come where ? " I said . " Huh . Me Second Planting . Me Hollywood Indian . " " 1 lave a chair , Mr. Planting . " I le snorted and his nostrils got very wide . They had been wide enough for mouseholes to start with . " Name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meat can I do for you ? " Ile lifted his voice and began to intone in a deep- chested sonorous boom . " He say come quick . Great white father say come quick . He say me bring you in Oct v chariot . He say  --  " " Yeah . Cut out the pig Latin , " I said . " I 'm no schoolmarmat the snake dances . " " Nuts , " the Indian said . We sneered at each other across the desk for a mo- , nt . He sneered better than I did . Then he removedhi% hat with massive disgust and turned it upside down . A11 oiled a finger around under the sweatband . Thatla e ace I the sweatband up into view , and it had not been misnamed . He removed a paper clip from the edge and threw a fold of tissue paper on the desk . He pointed at it angrily , with a well-chewed fingernail . His lank hair had a shelf around it , high up , from the too-tight hat . I unfolded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The card was no news to me . There had been three exactly like it in the mouthpieces of three **26;6175;TOOLONG . I played with my pipe , stared at the Indian and tried to ride him with my stare . He looked as nervous as a brick wall . " Okey , what does he want ? " " He want you come quick . Come now . Come in fiery  --  " " Nuts , " I said . The Indian liked that . He closed his mouth slowly and winked an eye solemnly and then almost grinned . " Also it will cost him a hundred bucks as a retainer , " I added , trying to look as if that was a nickel . " Huh ? " Suspicious again . Stick to basic English . " Hundred dollars , " I said . " Iron men . Fish . Bucks tothe number of one hundred . Mc no money , me no come . Savvy ? " I began to count a hundred with both hands . " Huh . Big shot , " The Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anotherfold of tissue paper on the desk . I took it and unwoundit . It contained a brand new hundred dollar bill . The Indian put his hat back on his head without bothering to tuck the hatband back in place . It looked only slightly more comic that way . I sat staring at the hundred dollar bill , with my mouth open . " Psychic is right , " I said at last . " A guy that smart I 'm afraid of . "  | " Not got all day , " the Indian remarked , conversationally . I opened my desk and took out a Colt .38 automatic of the type known as Super Match . I had n't worn it to visit Mrs. Lewin Lockridge Grayle . I stripped my coat off and strapped the leather harness on and tucked the automatic down inside it and strapped the lower strap and put my coat back on again . This meant as much to the Indian as if I had scratched my neck . " Gottum car , " he said . " Big car . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " I gottum own car . " " You come my car , " the Indian said threateningly . " I come your car , " I said . I locked the desk and office up , switched the buzzer off and went out , leaving the reception room door unlockedas usual . We went along the hail and down in the elevator . The Indian smelled . Even the elevator operator noticed it. 21The car was a dark blue seven-passenger sedan , a Packrdof the latest model , custom-built . It was the kind of r you wear your rope pearls in . It was parked by a fire- hydrant and a dark foreign-looking chauffeur with a facef carved wood was behind the wheel . The interior wasupholstered in quilted gray chenille . The Indian put methe u back . Sitting there alone I felt like a high-class corpse , laid out by an undertaker with a lot of good taste . The Indian got in beside the chauffeur and the car turned in the middle of the block and a cop across the street said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't mean it , and then bent down quickly to tie his shoe . We went west , dropped over to Sunset and slid fast and noiseless along that . The Indian sat motionless beside the chauffeur . An occasional whiff of his personality drifted back to me . The driver looked as if he was half asleep but he passed the fast boys in the convertible sedans as though they were being towed . They turned on all the green lights for him . Some drivers are like that . He never missed one . We curved through the bright mile or two of the Strip , past the antique shops with famous screen names on them , past the windows full of point lace and ancient pewter , past the gleaming new nightclubs with famous chefs and equally famous gambling rooms , run by polishedgraduates of the Purple Gang , past the GeorgianColonialvogue , now old hat , past the handsome modernisticbuildings in which the Hollywood flesh-peddlers never stop talking money , past a drive-in lunch which somehow did n't belong , even though the girls wore white silk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hips but glazed kid Hessian boots . Past all this and down a wide smooth curve to the bridle path of Beverly Hills and lights to the south , all colors of the spectrum and crystal clear in an evening without fog , past the shadowed mansions up on the hills to the north , past Beverly Hills altogether and up into the twisting foothill boulevard and the sudden cool dusk and the drift of wind from the sea . It had been a warm afternoon , but the heat was gone . We whipped past a distant cluster of lighted buildings and an endless series of lighted mansions , not too close to the road . We dipped down to skirt a huge green poloP137field with another equally huge practice field beside it , soared again to the top of a hill and swung mountainwardup a steep hillroad of clean concrete that passed orange groves , some rich man 's pet because this is not orange country , and then little by little the lighted windows of the millionaires ' homes were gone and the road narrowed and this was Stillwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canyon and made me think of a dead man and a moonless sky . Straggly stucco houses were molded flat to the side of the hill , like bas-reliefs . Then there were no more houses , just the still dark foothills with an early star or two above them , and the concrete ribbon of road and a sheer drop on one side into a tangle of scrub oak and manzanita where sometimes you can hear the call of the quails if you stop and keep still and wait . On the other side of the road was a raw clay bank at the edge of which a few unbeatablewild flowers hung on like naughty children that wo n't go to bed . Then the road twisted into a hairpin turn and the big tires scratched over loose stones , and the car tore lessendlessly up a long driveway lined with the wild geraniums . At the top of this , faintly lighted , lonely as a lighthouse , stood an eyrie , an eagle 's nest , an angular building of stucco and glass brick , raw and modernistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a psychicconsultant to hang out his shingle . Nobody would be able to hear any screams . ' The car turned beside the house and a light flicked on over a black door set into the heavy wall . The Indian climbed out grunting and opened the rear door of the Car . The chauffeur lit a cigarette with an electric lighter and a harsh smell of tobacco came back to me softly in the evening . I got out .   We went over to the black door . It opened of itself , slowly , almost with menace . Beyond it a narrow hallwayprobed back into the house . Light glowed from the glass brick walls . The Indian growled , " Huh . You go in , big shot . " " After you , Mr. Planting . " He scowled and went in and the door closed after us as silently and mysteriously as it had opened . At the end of the narrow hallway we squeezed into a little elevatorand the Indian closed the door and pressed a button . We rose softly , without sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mooncast shadow to what he was doing now . The elevator stopped , the door opened . There was light and I stepped out into a turret room where the day was still trying to he remembered . There were windows all around it . Far off the sea flickered . Darknessprowled slowly on the hills . There were paneled walls where there were no windows , and rugs on the floor with the soft colors of old Persians , and there was a reception desk that looked as if it had been made of carvings stolen from an ancient church . And behind the desk a woman sat and smiled at me , a dry tight witheredsmile that would turn to powder if you touched it . She had sleek coiled hair and a dark , thin , wasted Asiatic face . There were heavy colored stones in her ears and heavy rings on her fingers , including a moonstoneand an emerald in a silver setting that may have been a real emerald but somehow managed to look as phony as a dime store slave bracelet . And her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit for rings . She spoke . The voice was familiar . " Ah , Meester Marlowe , so ver-ry good of you to come . Amthor he weel be so ver-ry pleased . " P139I laid the hundred dollar bill the Indian had given me down on the desk . I looked behind me . The Indian had gone down again in the elevator . " Sorry . It was a nice thought , but I ca n't take this . " " Amthor he  --  he weesh to employ you , is it not ? " She smiled again . Her lips rustled like tissue paper . " I 'd have to find out what the job is first . " She nodded and got up slowly from behind the desk . She swished before me in a tight dress that fitted her like a mermaid 's skin and showed that she had a good figure if you like them four sizes bigger below the waist . " I weel conduct you , " she said . She pressed a button in the panelling and a door slid open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I looked back at her smile before I went through . It was older than Egypt now . The door slid silently shut behind me . There was nobody in the room . It was octagonal , draped in black velvet from floor to ceiling , with a high remote black ceiling that may have been of velvet too . In the middle of a coal black lustrelessrug stood an octagonal white table , just large enough for two pairs of elbows and in the middle of it a n ilk white globe on a black stand . The light came from this . How , I could n't see . On either side of the table there was a white octagonal stool which was a smaller edition of the table . Over against one wall there was one more such stool . There were no windows . There was nothing else in the room , nothing at all . On the walls there was not even a light fixture . If there were other doors , I did n't see them . I looked back at the one by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . I stood there for perhaps fifteen seconds with the faint obscure feeling of being watched . There was probably a peephole somewhere , but I could n't spot it . I gave up trying . I listened to my breath . The room was so still that I could hear it going through my nose , softly , like little curtains rustling . Then an invisible door on the far side of the room slid open and a man stepped through and the door closed behind him . The man walked straight to the table with his head down and sat on one of the octagonal stools and made a sweeping motion with one of the most beautifulhands I have ever seen . " Please be seated . Opposite me . Do not smoke and do not fidget . Try to relax , completely . Now how may I serve you ? " I sat down , got a cigarette into my mouth and rolled it along my lips without lighting it . I looked him over . He was thin , tall and straight as a steel rod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw . It could have been strained through silk gauze . His skin was as fresh as a rose petal . He might have been thirty-five or sixty-five . He was ageless . His hair was brushed , straight back from as good a profile as Barrymore ever had . His eyebrows were coal black , like the walls and ceiling and floor . His eyes were deep , far too deep . They were the depthless drugged eyes of the somnambulist . They were like a well I read about once . It was nine hundred years old , in an old castle . You could drop a stone into it and wait . You could listen and wait and then you would give up waitingand laugh and then just as you were ready to turn away a faint , minute splash would come back up to you from the bottom of that well , so tiny , so remote that you could hardly believe a well like that possible . His eyes were deep like that . And they were also eyes without expression , without soul , eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change , that could watch a man impaled and screaming in the hot sun with his eyelids cut off . He wore a double-breasted black business suit that had been cut by an artist . He stared vaguely at my fingers . " Please do not fidget , " he said . " It breaks the waves , disturbs my concentration . " " It makes the ice melt , the butter run and the cat squawk , " I said . He smiled the faintest smile in the world . " You did n't conic here to be impertinent , I 'm sure . " " You seem to forget why I did come . By the way , I gave that hundred dollar bill back to your secretary . I cane , as you may recall , about some cigarettes . Russian cigarettes filled with marihuana . With your card rolled in the hollow mouthpieces . " " You wish to find out why that happened ? " " Yeah . I ought to be paying you the hundred dollars . " " ' That will not be necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not know . This is one of them . " For a moment I almost believed him . His face was assmooth as an angel 's wing . " Then why send me a hundred dollars  --  and a tough Indian that stinks  --  and a car ? By the way , does the Indianhave to stink ? If he 's working for you , could n't you sort of get him to take a bath ? " " Ile is a natural medium . They are rare  --  like diamonds , and like diamonds , are sometimes found in dirty places . I understand you are a private detective ? " " Yes . " " I think you are a very stupid person . You look stupid . You are in a stupid business . And you came here on a $t lipid mission . " " I get it , " I said . " I 'm stupid . It sank in after a while . "   " And I think I need not detain you any longer . " " You 're not detaining me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I want to know why those cards were in those cigarettes . " He shrugged the smallest shrug that could be shrugged . " My cards are available to anybody . I do not give my friends marihuana cigarettes . Your question remainsstupid . " " I wonder if this would brighten it up any . The cigaretteswere in a cheap Chinese or Japanese case of imitationtortoiseshell . Ever see anything like that ? " " No . Not that I recall . " " I can brighten it up a little more . The case was in the pocket of a man named Lindsay Marriott . Ever hear of him ? " He thought . " Yes . I tried at one time to treat him for camera shyness . He was trying to get into pictures . It was a waste of time . Pictures slid not want him . " " I can guess that , " I said . " lie would photograph like . Isadora Duncan . I 've still got the big one left . Why did you sent me the C-note . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I am no fool . I am in a very sensitive profession . I am a quack . That is to say I do things which the doctors in their small frightenedselfish guild can not accomplish . I am in danger at all times  --  from people like you . I merely wish to estimatethe danger before dealing with it . " " Pretty trivial in my case , huh ? " " It hardly exists , " he said politely and made a peculiar motion with his left hand which made my eyes jump at it . Then he put it down very slowly on the white table and looked down at it . Then he raised his depthless eyes again and folded his arms . " Your hearing  --  " " I smell it now , " I said . " I was n't thinking of him . "  |p143I  turned my head to the left . The Indian was sitting on the third white stool against the black velvet . IIe had some kind of a white smock on him over his other clothes . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head bent forward a little , as if he had been asleep for an hour . His dark strong face was full of shadows . I looked back at Amthor . He was smiling his minute smile . " I bet that makes the dowagers shed their false teeth , " I said . " What does he do for real money  --  sit on your knee and sing French songs ? " IIe made an impatient gesture . " Get to the point , please . " " Last night Marriott hired me to go with him on an expeditionthat involved paying some money to some crooks at a spot they picked . I got knocked on the head . When I came out of it Marriott had been murdered . " Nothing changed much in Amthor 's face . He did n't scream or run up the walls . But for him the reaction was sharp . He unfolded his aims and refolded them the other way . His mouth looked grim . Then he sat like a stone lion outside the Public Library . " The cigarettes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at me coolly . " But not by the police , I take it . Since the police have not been here . " " Correct . " " The hundred dollars , " he said very softly , " was hardly enough . " " That depends what you expect to buy with it . " " You have these cigarettes with you ? " " One of them . But they do n't prove anything . As you said , anybody could get your cards . I 'm just wondering why they were where they were . Any ideas ? "   " How well did you know Mr. Marriott ? " he asked softly . " Not at all . But I had ideas about him . They were so obvious they stuck out . " Amthor tapped lightly on the white table . The Indian still slept with his chin on his huge chest , his heavy-lidded eyes tight shut . " By the way , did you ever meet a Mrs. Grayle , a wealthy lady who lives in Bay City ? " He nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech . She had a very slight impediment . " " You did a sweep job on her , " I said . " She talks as good as I do now . " That failed to amuse him . Ile still tapped on the table . I listened to the taps . Something about them I did n't like . They sounded like a code . Ile stopped , folded his arms again and leaned back against the air . " What I like about this job everybody knows everybody , " I said . " Mrs. Grayle knew Marriott too . " " How did you find that out ? " he asked slowly . I did n't say anything . " You will have to tell the police  --  about those cigarettes , " he said . I shrugged . " You are wondering why I do not have you thrown out , " Amthor said pleasantly . " Second Planting could break your neck like a celery stalk . I am wondering myself . You seem to have some sort of theory . Blackmail I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . But naturally there are certain elements which would like to show me in a bad light . Psychiatrists , sex specialists , neurologists , nasty little men with rubber hammers and shelves loaded with the literature of aberrations.  |p145And  of course they are all  --  doctors . While I am still a- quack . What is your theory ? " I tried to stare him down , but it could n't be done . I felt myself licking my lips . Ile shrugged lightly . " I ca n't blame you for wanting to keep it to yourself . This is a matter that I must give thought to . Perhaps you are a much more intelligent ! Ilan than I thought . I also make mistakes . In the mean-t role  --  " IIe leaned forward and put a hand on each side of the milky globe . " I think Marriott was a blackmailer of women , " I said . " A ! ! d finger man for a jewel mob . But who told him what won ten to cultivate  --  so that he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make love to them , make them load up with the ice and take them out , and then slip to a phone and tell the boys where to operate . ' That , " Amthor said carefully , " is your picture of Marriott  --  and of me . I am slightly disgusted . " I leaned forward until my face was not more than a foot from his . " You 're in a racket . Dress it up all you please and it 's still a racket . And it was n't just the cards , Amthor . As you say , anybody could get those . It was n't tin marihuana . You would n't be in a cheap line like that  --  not with your chances . But on the back of each card there is a blank space . And on blank spaces , or even on written ones , there is sometimes invisible writtug . Ile smiled bleakly , but I hardly saw it . His hands moved over the milky bowl . The light went out . The room was as black as Carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stood up and jerked the gun out of the holster under my arm . But it was no good . My coat was buttoned and I was too slow . I 'd have been too slow anyway , if it came to shooting anybody . There was a soundless rush of air and an earthy smell . In the complete darkness the Indian hit me from behind and pinned my arms to my sides . IIe started to lift me . I could have got the gun out still and fanned the room with blind shots , but I was a long way from friends . It did n't seem as if there was any point in it . I let go of the gun and took hold of his wrists . They were greasy and hard to hold . The Indian breathed gutturallyand set me down with a jar that lifted the top of my head . He had my wrists now , instead of me having his . He twisted them behind me fast and a knee like a corner stone went into my back . IIe bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the City Hall . He bent me . I tried to yell , for no reason at all . Breath panted in my throat and could n't get out . The Indian threw me sideways and got a body scissors on me as I fell . He had me in a barrel . His hands went to my neck . Sometimes I wake up in the night . I feel them there and I smell the smell of him . I feel the breath fighting and losing and the greasy fingers digging in . Then I get up and take a drink and turn the radio on . I was just about gone when the light flared on again , blood red , on account of the blood in my eyeballs and at the back of them . A face floated around and a hand pawed me delicately , but the other hands stayed on my throat . A voice said softly , " Let him breathe  --  a little . " The fingers slackened . I wrenched loose from them.  |p147Something  that glinted hit me on the side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his feet . " The Indian got me on my feet . He pulled me back against the wall , holding me by both twisted wrists . " Amateur , " the voice said softly and the shiny thing that was as hard and bitter as death hit me again , across the face . Something warm trickled . I licked at it and tasted iron and salt . A hand explored my wallet . A hand explored all my pockets . The cigarette in tissue paper came out and was unwrapped . It went somewhere in the haze that was in front of me . " ' There were three cigarettes ? " the voice said gently , Lund the shining thing hit my jaw again . " ' Three , " I gulped. " just where did you say the others were ? " " In my desk  --  at the office . " The shiny thing hit me again . " You are probably lying  --  hut I can find out . " Keys shone with funny little red lights in front of me . The voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron fingers went into my throat . I was strained hark against him , against the smell of him and the hard muscles of his stomach . I reached up and took one of his fingers and tried to twist it . The voice said softly : " Amazing . He 's learning . " The glinting thing swayed through the air again . Itsmacked my jaw , the thing that had once been my jaw . " I , et him go . He 's tame , " the voice said . The heavy strong arms dropped away and I swayed forward and took a step and steadied myself . Amthor Mood smiling very slightly , almost dreamily in front of inc . He held my gun in his delicate , lovely hand . He held it pointed at my chest .   " I could teach you , " he said in his soft voice . " But to what purpose ? A dirty little man in a dirty little world . One spot of brightness on you and you would still be that . Is it not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his smile with everything I had left . It was n't so bad considering . He reeled and blood came out of both his nostrils . Then he caught himself and straightened up and lifted the gun again . " Sit down , my child , " he said softly . " I have visitors coming . I am so glad you hit mc . It helps a great deal . " I felt for the white stool and sat down and put my head down on the white table beside the milky globe which was now shining again softly . I stared at it sideways , my face on the table . The light fascinated me . Nice light , nice soft light . Behind me and around me there was nothing but silence . I think I went to sleep , just like that , with a bloody face on the table , and a thin beautiful devil with my gun in his hand watching me and smiling . " All right , " the big one said . " You can quit stalling now . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other room , pally . " I stood up , still dreamy . We went somewhere , through a door . Then I saw where it was  --  the reception room with the windows all around . It was black dark now outside . The woman with the wrong rings sat at her desk . A man stood beside her. 1 " Sit here , pally . " He pushed me down . It was a nice chair , straight but comfortable but I was n't in the mood for it . The woman behind the desk had a notebook open and was reading out loud from it . A short elderly man with a deadpan expression and a gray mustache was listening to her . Amthor was standing by a window , with his back to the room , looking out at the placid line of the ocean , far off , beyond the pier lights , beyond the world . He looked at it as if he loved it . He half turned his head to look at me once , and I could see that the blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't the nose I had first met , not by two sizes . That made me grin , cracked lips and all . " You got fun , pally ? " I looked at what made the sound , what was in front of me and what had helped me get where I was . He was a windblown blossom of some two hundred pounds with freckled teeth and the mellow voice of a circus barker . I le was tough , fast and he ate red meat . Nobody could 1 ) iisli him around . He was the kind of cop who spits on his blackjack every night instead of saying his prayers. it he had humorous eyes. 1 le stood in front of me splay-legged , holding my open wallet in his hand , making scratches on the leather with his right thumbnail , as if he just liked to spoil things . Little things , if they were all he had . But probably faces would give him more fun . " Peeper , huh , pally ? From the big bad burg , huh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the back of his head . He had dusty brown hair darkened by sweat on his forehead . His humorous eyes were flecked with red veins.  | My throat felt as though it had been through a mangle . I reached up and felt it . That Indian . He had fingers like pieces of tool steel . The dark woman stopped reading out of her notebook and closed it . The elderly smallish man with the gray mustache nodded and came over to stand behind the one who was talking to me . " Cops ? " I asked , rubbing my chin . " What do you think , pally ? " Policeman 's humor . The small one had a cast in one eye , and it looked half blind . " Not L.A. , " I said , looking at him . " That eye would retire him in Los Angeles . " The big man handed me my wallet . I looked through it . I had all the money still . All the cards . It had everything that belonged in it . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big one said . " Something that would make us get fond of you . " " Give me back my gun . " He leaned forward a little and thought . I could see him thinking . It hurt his corns . " Oh , you want your gun , pally ? " He looked sideways at the one with the gray mustache . " Ile wants his gun , " he told him . He looked at me again . " And what would you want your gun for , pally ? " " I want to shoot an Indian . " " Oh , you want to shoot an Indian , pally . " " Yeah  --  just one Indian , pop . " He looked at the one with the mustache again . " This guy is very tough , " he told him . " He wants to shoot an Indian . " " Listen , Hemingway , do n't repeat everything I say , " I said . " I think the guy is nuts , " the big one said . " He justp151called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The one with the mustache bit a cigar and said nothing . The tall beautiful man at the window turned slowly and said softly : " I think possibly he is a little unbalanced . " " 1 ca n't think of any reason why he should call me 1 I el nil-Agway , " Hemingway , " the big one said . " My name ai n't Hemingway . The older man said : " I did n't see a gun . " They looked at Amthor . Amthor said : " It 's inside . I have it . I 'll give it to you , Mr. Blane . " The big man leaned down from his hips and bent his knees a little and breathed in my face . " What for did you call me Hemingway , pally ? " " ' There are ladies present . " Ile straightened up again . " You see . " He looked at the one with the mustache . The one with the mustache nodded and then turned and walked away , across theThe sliding door opened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence . The dark woman looked down at tin top of her desk and frowned . The big man looked at my right eyebrow and slowly shook his head from side to side , wonderingly . The door opened again and the man with the mustachcame back . He picked a hat up from somewhere and handed it to me . He took my gun out of his pocket and handed it to me . I knew by the weight it was empty . 1 tucked it under my arm and stood up . The big man said : " Let 's go , pally . Away from here . I think maybe a little air will help you to get straightenedout ... " Okey , Hemingway . " " He 's doing that again , " the big man said sadly . " Call- ing me Hemingway on account of there are ladies present . Would you think that would be some kind of dirty crack in his book ? " The man with the mustache said , " Hurry up . " The big man took me by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It came up . We got into it . At the bottom of the shaft we got out and walked along the narrow hallway and out of the black door . It was crisp clear air outside , high enough to be above the drift of foggy spray from the ocean . I breathed deeply . The big man still had hold of my arm . There was a car standing there , a plain dark sedan , with private plates . The big man opened the front door and complained : " It ai n't really up to your class , pally . But a little air will set you up fine . Would that be all right with you ? We would n't want to do anything that you would n't like us to do , pally . " " Where 's the Indian ? " He shook his head a little and pushed me into the car . I got into the right side of the front seat . " Oh , yeah , the Indian , " he said . " You got to shoot him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We got him in the back of the car . I looked in the hack of the car . It was empty . " Hell , he ai n't there , " the big one said . " Somebody must of glommed him off . You ca n't leave nothing in a unlocked car any more . " " Hurry up , " the man with the mustache said , and got into the back seat . Hemingway went around and pushedP153his hard stomach behind the wheel . He started the car . We turned and drifted off down the driveway lined with wild geraniums . A cold wind lifted off the sea . The stars were too far off . They said nothing . We reached the bottom of the drive and turned out onto the concrete mountain road and drifted without haste along that . " I low come you do n't have a car with you , pally ? " " Amthor sent for me . " " Why would that be , pally ? " " It must have been he wanted to see me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He figures things out . " He spit out of the side of the car and made turn nicely and let the car ride its motor down the hill . " I le says you called him up on the phone and tried to pit the bite on him . So he figures he better have a looksee what kind of guy he is doing business with  --  if he is doing business . So he sends his own car . " " Oil account of he knows he is going to call some cops In knows and I wo n't need mine to get home with , " I said . " Okey , Hemingway . " " Yeah , that again . Okey . Well , he has a dictaphone under his table and his secretary takes it all down and when we come she reads it back to Mister Blane here . " I turned and looked at Mister Blane . He was smoking u cigar , peacefully , as though he had his slippers on . He did n't look at me. " 1 Ake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely a stock bunch of notes they had all fixed up for a case like that . " " Maybe you would like to tell us why you wanted to wee his guy , " Hemingway suggested politely . You mean while I still have part of my face ? " " Aw , we ai n't those kind of boys at all , " he said , with a large gesture.  | " You know Amthor pretty well , do n't you , Heming-way ? " " Mr. Blanc kind of knows him . Me , I just do what the orders is . " " Who the hell is Mister Blane ? " " That 's the gentleman in the back seat . " " And besides being in the back seat who the hell is he ? " " Why , Jesus , everybody knows Mr. Blanc . " " All right , " I said , suddenly feeling very weary . There was a little more silence , more curves , more winding ribbons of concrete , more darkness , and more pain . The big man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no ladies present we really do n't give so much time to why you went back up there , but this Hemingway stuff is what really has me down . " " A gag , " I said . " An old , old gag . " " Who is this Hemingway person at all ? " " A guy that keeps saying the same thing over and over until you begin to believe it must be good . " " That must take a hell of a long time , " the big man said . " For a private dick you certainly have a wanderingkind of mind . Are you still wearing your own teeth ? " " Yeah , with a few plugs in them . " " Well , you certainly have been lucky , pally . " The man in the back seat said : " This is all right . Turn right at the next . " " Check . " Hemingway swung the sedan into a narrow dirt road that edged along the flank of a mountain . We drove along that about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Here , " the man in the back seat said.  |p155Hemingway  stopped the car and set the brake . He leaned across me and opened the door . " Well , it 's nice to have met you , pally . But do n't come back . Anyways not on business . Out . " " I walk home from here ? " The man in the back seat said : " Hurry up . " " Yeah , you walk home from here , pally . Will that be all right with you ? " " Sure , it will give me time to think a few things out . For instance you boys are not L.A. cops . But one of you is a cop , maybe both of you . I 'd say you are Bay City cops . I 'm wondering why you were out of your territory . " " Ai n't that going to be kind of hard to prove , pally ? " " Goodnight , Hemingway . " He did n't answer . Neither of them spoke . I started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the running board and leaned forward , still a little dizzy . The man in the back seat made a sudden flashing movement that I sensed rather than saw . A pool of darknessopened at my feet and was far , far deeper than the blackest night . I dived into it . It had no bottom . The room was full of smoke . The smoke hung straight up in the air , in thin lines , straight up and down like a curtain of small clear beads . Two windows seemed to be open in an end wall , but the smoke did n't move . I had never seen the room before . There were bars across the windows . I was dull , without thought . I felt as if I had slept for a year . But the smoke bothered me . I lay on my back and thought about it . After a long time I took a deep breath that hurt my lungs . I yelled : " Fire ! " That made me laugh . I did n't know what was funny about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bed and laughed . I did n't like the sound of the laugh . It was the laugh of a nut . The one yell was enough . Steps thumped rapidly outside the room and a key was jammed into a lock and the door swung open . A man jumped in sideways and shut the door after him . His right hand reached towards his hip . He was a short thick man in a white coat . His eyes had a queer look , black and flat . There were bulbs of gray skin at the outer corners of them . I turned my head on the hard pillow and yawned . " Do n't count that one , Jack . It slipped out , " I said . He stood there scowling , his right hand hovering towardshis right hip . Greenish malignant face and flat black eyes and gray white skin and nose that seemed just a shell . " Maybe you want some more strait-jacket , " he sneered . " I 'm fine , Jack . Just fine . Had a long nap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ? " " Where you belong . " " Seems like a nice place , " I said . " Nice people , nice atmosphere . I guess I 'll have me a short nap again . " " Better be just that , " he snarled . He went out . The door shut . The lock clicked . The steps growled into nothing . He had n't done the smoke any good . It still hung there in the middle of the room , all across the room . Likep157a curtain . It did n't dissolve , did n't float off , did n't move . There was air in the room , and I could feel it on my face . But the smoke could n't feel it . It was a gray web woven by a thousand spiders . I wondered how they had got them to work together . Cotton flannel pajamas . The kind they have in the County Hospital . No front , not a stitch more than is essential . Coarse , rough material . The neck chafed my throat . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I reached up and felt the throat muscles . They were still sore . Just one Indian , pop . Okey , Hemingway . So you want to be a detective ? Earn good money . Nine easy lessons . We provide badge . For fifty cents extra we send you a truss . The throat felt sore but the fingers feeling it did n't feel anything . They might just as well have been a bunch of bananas . I looked at them . They looked like fingers . No good . Mail order fingers . They must have come with the badge and the truss . And the diploma . It was night . The world outside the windows was a black world . A glass porcelain bowl hung from the middle of the ceiling on three brass chains . There was light in it . It had little colored lumps around the edge , orange and blue alternately . I stared at them . I was tired of the smoke . As I stared they began to open up like little portholes and heads popped out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of small dolls , but alive . There was a man in a yachting cap with a Johnnie Walker nose and a fluffy blonde in a picture hat and a thin man with a crooked bow tie . He looked like a waiter in a beachtown flytrap . He opened his lips and sneered : " Would you like your steak rare or medium , sir ? " I closed my eyes tight and winked them hard and when I opened them again it was just a sham porcelain bowl on three brass chains . But the smoke still hung motionless in the moving air . I took hold of the corner of a rough sheet and wiped the sweat off my face with the numb fingers the correspondenceschool had sent me after the nine easy lessons , one half in advance , Box Two Million Four Hundredand Sixty Eight Thousand Nine Hundred and Twenty Four , Cedar City , Iowa . Nuts . Completely nuts . I sat up on the bed and after a while I could reach the floor with my feet . They were bare and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left , madam . Extra large safety pins on the right . The feet began to feel the floor . I stood up . Too far up . I crouched over , breathing hard and held the side of the bed and a voice that seemed to come from under the bed said over and over again : " You 've got the dt 's .. . you 've got the dt 's . . . you 've got the dt 's . " I started to walk , wobbling like a drunk . There was a bottle of whiskey on a small white enamel table between the two barred windows . It looked like a good shape . It looked about half full . I walked towards it . There are a lot of nice people in the world , in spite . You can crab over the morning paper and kick the shins of the guy in the next scat at the movies and feel mean and discouraged and sneer at the politicians , but there are a lot of nice people in the world just the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whiskey there . He had a heart as big as one of Mae West 's hips . I reached it and put both my still half-numb hands down on it and hauled it up to my mouth , sweating as ifp159I was lifting one end of the Golden Gate Bridge . I took a long untidy drink . I put the bottle down again , with infinite care . I tried to lick underneath my chin . The whiskey had a funny taste . While I was realizing t hat it had a funny taste I saw a washbowl jammed into the corner of the wall . I made it . I just made it . I vomited . Dizzy Dean never threw anything harder . Time passed  --  an agony of nausea and staggering and dazedness and clinging to the edge of the bowl and making animal sounds for help . It passed . I staggered back to the bed and lay down on my back again and lay there panting , watching the smoke . The smoke was n't quite so clear . Not quite so real . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then quite suddenly it was n't there at all and the light from the porcelain ceiling fixture etched the room sharply . I sat up again . There was a heavy wooden chair against the wall near the door . There was another door besides the door the man in the white coat had come in at . A closet door , probably . It might even have my clothes in it . The floor was covered with green and gray linoleum in squares . The walls were painted white . A clean room . The bed on which I sat was a narrow iron 1 iospital bed , lower than they usually are , and there were thick leather straps with buckles attached to the sides , about where a man 's wrists and ankles would be . It was a swell room  --  to get out of . I had feeling all over my body now , soreness in my head and throat and in my arm . I could n't remember about the arm . I rolled up the sleeve of the cotton pajamathing and looked at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin all the way from the elbow to the shoulder . Around each was a small discolored patch , about the size of a quarter . Dope . I had been shot full of dope to keep me quiet . Perhaps scopolamine too , to make me talk . Too much dope for the time . I was having the French fits coming out of it . Some do , some do n't . It all depends how you are put together . Dope . That accounted for the smoke and the little heads around the edge of the ceiling light and the voices and the screwy thoughts and the straps and bars and the numb fingers and feet . The whiskey was probably part of somebody 's forty-eight hour liquor cure . They had just left it around so that I would n't miss anything . I stood up and almost hit the opposite wall with my stomach . That made me lie down and breathe very gently for quite a long time . I was tingling all over now and sweating . I could feel little drops of sweat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the side of my nose to the corner of my mouth . My tongue licked at them foolishly . I sat up once more and planted my feet on the floor and stood up . " Okey , Marlowe , " I said between my teeth . " You 're a tough guy . Six feet of iron man . One hundred and ninety pounds stripped and with your face washed . Hard muscles and no glass jaw . You can take it . You 've been sapped down twice , had your throat choked and been beaten half silly on the jaw with a gun barrel . You 've been shot full of hop and kept under it until you 're as crazy as two waltzing mice . And what does all that amount to ? Routine . Now let 's see you do something really tough , like putting your pants on . " I lay down on the bed again.  |p161Time  passed again . I do n't know how long . I had no watch . They do n't make that kind of time in watches anyway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I stood up and started to walk . No fun walking . Makes your heart jump like a nervous cat . Better lie down and go back to sleep . Better take it easy for a while . You 're in bad shape , pally. ( ) key , Hemingway , I 'm weak . I could n't knock over a flower vase . I could n't break a fingernail . Nothing doing . I 'm walking . I 'm tough . I 'm getting out of here . I lay down on the bed again . The fourth time was a little better . I got across the room and back twice . I went over to the washbowl and rinsed it out and leaned on it and drank water out of the palm of my hand . I kept it down . I waited a little and drank more . Much better . I walked . I walked . I walked . Half an hour of walking and my knees were shaking but my head was clear . I drank more water , a lot of water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I walked back to the bed . It was a lovely bed . It was made of rose-leaves . It was the most beautiful bed in the world . They had got it from Carole Lombard . It was too soft for her . It was worth the rest of my life to lie down in it for two minutes . Beautiful soft bed , beautifulsleep , beautiful eyes closing and lashes falling and the gentle sound of breathing and darkness and rest sunk in deep pillows . . . . I walked . They built the Pyramids and got tired of them and pulled them down and ground the stone up to make concretefor Boulder Dam and they built that and broughtp162the water to the Sunny Southland and used it to have a flood with . I walked all through it . I could n't be bothered . I stopped walking . I was ready to talk to somebody . The closet door was locked . The heavy chair was too heavy for me . It was meant to be . I stripped the sheets and pad off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a mesh spring underneath fastened top and bottom by coil springs of black enameled metal about nine inches long . I went to work on one of them . It was the hardest work I ever did . Ten minutes later I had two bleeding fingers and a loose spring . I swung it . It had a nice balance . It was heavy . It had a whip to it . And when this was all ( lone I looked across at the whiskey bottle and it would have done just as well , and I had forgotten all about it . I drank some more water . I rested a little , sitting on the side of the bare springs . Then I went over to the door and put my mouth against the hinge side and yelled : " Fire ! Fire ! Fire ! " It was a short wait and a pleasant one . He came runninghard along the hallway outside and his key jammed viciously into the lock and twisted hard . The door jumped open . I was flat against the wall on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , a nice little tool about five inches long , covered with woven brown leather . His eyes popped at the stripped bed and then began to swing around . I giggled and socked him . I laid the coil spring onp163the side of his head and he stumbled forward . I followed him down to his knees . I hit him twice more . He made a moaning sound . I took the sap out of his limp hand . He whined . I used my knee on his face . It hurt my knee . He did n't tell me whether it hurt his face . While he was still groaning I knocked him cold with the sap . I got the key from the outside of the door and locked it from the inside and went through him . He had more keys . One of them fitted my closet . In it my clothes hung . I went through my pockets . The money was gone from my wallet . I went back to the man with the white coat . He had too much money for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heaved him on to the bed and strapped him wrist and ankle and stuffed half a yard of sheet into his mouth . He had a smashed nose . I waited long enough to make sure he could breathe through it . I was sorry for him . A simple hardworking little guy trying to hold his job down and get his weekly pay check . Maybe with a wife and kids . Too bad . And all he had to help him was a sap . It did n't seem fair . I put the doped whiskey down where he could reach it , if his Lands had n't been strapped . I patted his shoulder . I almost cried over him . All my clothes , even my gun harness and gun , but no shells in the gun , hung in the closet . I dressed with fumbling fingers , yawning a great deal . The man on the bed rested . I left him there and locked him in . Outside was a wide silent hallway with three closed doors . No sounds came from behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle and was as silent as the rest of the house . At the end there was a jog in the hall and then another hall at right angles and the head of a big old-fashioned staircase with white oak bannisters . It curved graciously down into the dim hall below . Two stained glass inner doors ended the lower hall . It was tessellated and thick rugs lay on it . A crack of light seeped past the edge of an almost closed door . But no sound at all . An old house , built as once they built them and do n't build them any more . Standing probably on a quiet street with a rose arbor at the side and plenty of flowers in front . Gracious and cool and quiet in the bright Californiasun . And inside it who cares , but do n't let them scream too loud . I had my foot out to go down the stairs when I heard a man cough . That jerked me around and I saw there was a half open door along the other hallway at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , close to the partly open door , but not in it . A wedge of light lay at my feet on the carpet . The man coughed again . It was a deep cough , from a deep chest . It sounded peaceful and at ease . It was none of my business . My business was to get out of there . But any man whose door could be open in that house interested me . He would be a man of position , worth tipping your hat to . I sneaked a little into the wedge of light . A newspaper rustled . I could see part of a room and it was furnished like a room , not like a cell . There was a dark bureau with a hat on it and some magazines . Windows with lace curtains , a good carpet . Bed springs creaked heavily . A big guy , like his cough . I reached out fingertips and pushed the door an inch or two . Nothing happened . Nothing ever was slower than my head craning in . I saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , the ashtray heaped withp165stubs that overflowed on to a night table and from that to the carpet . A dozen mangled newspapers all over the bed . One of them in a pair of huge hands before a huge face . I saw the hair above the edge of the green paper . Dark , curly  --  black even  --  and plenty of it . A line of white skin under it . The paper moved a little more and I did n't breathe and the man on the bed did n't look up . He needed a shave . He would always need a shave . I had seen him before , over on Central Avenue , in a negro dive called Florian 's . I had seen him in a loud suit with white golf balls on the coat and a whiskey sour in his hand . And I had seen him with an Army Colt looking like a toy in his fist , stepping softly through a broken door . I had seen some of his work and it was the kind of work that stays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed and yawned bitterly and reached sideways for a frayed pack of cigarettes on the night table . One of them went into his mouth . Light flared at the end of his thumb . Smoke came out of his nose . " Ah , " he said , and the paper went up in front of his face again . I left him there and went back along the side hall . Mr. Moose Malloy seemed to be in very good hands . I went back to the stairs and down . A voice murmured behind the almost closed door . I waited for the answering voice . None . It was a telephone conversation . I went over close to the door and listened . . It was a low voice , a mere murmur . Nothing carried that meant anything . There was finally a dry ( licking sound . Silence continued inside the room after t hat . This was the time to leave , to go far away . So I pushed the door open and stepped quietly in . P166It was an office , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A glass-doored bookcase with heavy books inside . A first aid cabinet on the wall . A white enamel and glass sterilizing cabinet with a lot of hypodermicneedles and syringes inside it being cooked . A wide flat desk with a blotter on it , a bronze paper cutter , a pen set , an appointment book , very little else , except the elbows of a man who sat brooding , with his face in his hands . Between the spread yellow fingers I saw hair the color of wet brown sand , so smooth that it appeared to be painted on his skull . I took three more steps and his eyes must have looked beyond the desk and seen my shoes move . His head came up and he looked at me . Sunken colorless eyes in a parchment-like face . He unclaspedhis hands and leaned back slowly and looked at me with no expression at all . Then he spread his hands with a sort of helpless but disapproving gesture and when they came to rest again , one of them was very close to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and showed him the blackjack . His index and second finger still moved towards the corner of the desk . " The buzzer , " I said , " wo n't buy you anything tonight . I put your tough boy to sleep . " His eyes got sleepy . " You have been a very sick man , sir . A very sick man . I ca n't recommend your being up and about yet . " I said : " The right hand . " I snapped the blackjack at it . It coiled into itself like a wounded snake . I went around the desk grinning without there beingP167anything to grin at . He had a gun in the drawer of course . They always have a gun in the drawer and they always get it too late , if they get it at all . I took it out . I t was a .38 automatic , a standard model not as good as nine , but I could use its ammunition . There did n't seem to be any in the drawer . I started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes still sunken and sad . " Maybe you 've got another buzzer under the carpet , " I said . " Maybe it rings in the Chief 's office down at headquarters . Do n't use it . Just for an hour I 'm a very tough guy . Anybody comes in that door is walking into a coffin . " " There is no buzzer under the carpet , " he said . His voice had the slightest possible foreign accent . I got his magazine out and my empty one and changed them . I ejected the shell that was in the chamber of his gun and let it lie . I jacked one up into the chamber of mine and went back to the other side of the desk again . There was a spring lock on the door . I backed towardsit and pushed it shut and heard the lock click . There was also a bolt . I turned that . I went back to the desk and sat in a chair . It took my last ounce of strength . " Whiskey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . " Whiskey , " I said . He went to the medicine cabinet and got a flat bottle with a green revenue stamp on it and a glass . " Two glasses , " I said . " I tried your whiskey once . I damn near hit Catalina Island with it . " He brought two small glasses and broke the seal and filled the two glasses . " You first , " I said .   He smiled faintly and raised one of the glasses . " Your health , sir  --  what remains of it . " He drank . I drank . I reached for the bottle and stood it near me and waited for the heat to get to my heart . My heart began to pound , but it was back up in my chest again , not hanging on a shoelace . " I had a nightmare , " I said . " Silly idea . I dreamed I was tied to a cot and shot full of dope and locked in a barred room . I got very weak . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick man . I was knocked on the head and brought into a place where they did that to me . They took a lot of trouble . I 'm not that important . " He said nothing . He watched me . There was a remotespeculation in his eyes , as if he wondered how long I would live . " I woke up and the room was full of smoke , " I said . " It was just a hallucination , irritation of the optic nerve or whatever a guy like you would call it . Instead of pink snakes I had smoke . So I yelled and a toughie in a white coat came in and showed me a blackjack . It took me a long time to get ready to take it away from him . I got his keys and my clothes and even took my money out of his pocket . So here I am . All cured . What were you saying ? " " I made no remark , " he said . " Remarks want you to make them , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting to be said . This thing here  --  " I waved the blackjack lightly , " is a persuader . I had to borrow it from a guy . " " Please give it to me at once , " he said with a smile you would get to love . It was like the executioner 's smile when he comes to your cell to measure you for the drop . A little friendly , a little paternal , and a little cautiousat the same time . You would get to love it if thereP169was any way you could live long enough . I dropped the blackjack into his palm , his left palm . " Now the gun , please , " he said softly . " You have been a very sick man , Mr. Marlowe . I think I shall have to insist that you go back to bed . " I stared at him . " I am Dr. Sonderborg , " he said , " and I do n't want any nonsense . " He laid the blackjack down on the desk in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish . His long fingers made movements like dying butterflies . " The gun , please , " he said softly . " I advise strongly  --  " " What time is it , warden ? " He looked mildly surprised . I had my wrist watch on now , but it had run down . " It is almost midnight . Why ? " " What day is it ? " " Why , my dear sir  --  Sunday evening , of course . " I steadied myself on the desk and tried to think and held the gun close enough to him so that he might try and grab it . " That 's over forty-eight hours . No wonder I had fits . Who brought me here ? " He stared at me and his left hand began to edge towards the gun . He belonged to the Wandering Hand Society . The girls would have had a time with him . " Do n't make me get tough , " I whined . " Do n't make me lose my beautiful manners and my flawless English . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courage . He grabbed for the gun . It was n't where he grabbed . I sat back and put it in my lap . He reddened and grabbed for the whiskey and poured himself another drink and downed it fast . He drew a deep breath and shuddered . He did n't like the taste of liquor . Dopers never do . " You will be arrested at once , if you leave here , " he said sharply . " You were properly committed by an officerof the law  --  " " Officers of the law ca n't do it . " That jarred him , a little . His yellowish face began to work . " Shake it up and pour it , " I said . " Who put me in here , why and how ? I 'm in a wild mood tonight . I want to go dance in the foam . I hear the banshees calling . I have n't shot a man in a week . Speak out , Dr. Fell . Pluck the antique viol , let the soft music float . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said coldly . " You very nearly died .

" " You do n't scream and fight from narcotic poisoning , doc . You just lie in a coma . Try again . And skim it . All I want is the cream . Who put me in your private funny house ? " " But  --  " " But me no buts . I 'll make a sop of you . I 'll drown you in a butt of Malmsey wine . I wish I had a butt of Malmsey wine myself to drown in . Shakespeare . He knew his liquor too . Let 's have a little of our medicine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple more . " Get on with it , Karloff . " " The police put you in here . "  | " What police ? " " The Bay City police naturally . " His restless yellow fingers twisted his glass . " This is Bay City . " " Oh . Did this police have a name ? " " A Sergeant Galbraith , I believe . Not a regular patrol car officer . He and another officer found you wanderingoutside the house in a dazed condition on Friday night . They brought you in because this place was close . I thought you were an addict who had taken an overdose . But perhaps I was wrong . " " It 's a good story . I could n't prove it wrong . But why keep me here ? " He spread his restless hands . " I have told you again and again that you were a very sick man and still are . What would you expect me to do ? " " I must owe you some money then . " He shrugged . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair back a little . " Dirt cheap . Try and get it . " " If you leave here , " he said sharply , " you will be arrestedat once . " I leaned back over the desk and breathed in his face . " Not just for going out of here , Karloff . Open that wall safe . " He stood up in a smooth lunge . " This has gone quite far enough . " " You wo n't open it ? " " I most certainly will not open it . " " This is a gun I 'm holding . " He smiled , narrowly and bitterly . " It 's an awful big safe , " I said . " New too . This is a fine gun . You wo n't open it ? " Nothing changed in his face.  | " Damn it , " I said . " When you have a gun in your hand , people are supposed to do anything you tell them to . It does n't work , does it ? " He smiled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . I was going to collapse . I staggered at the desk and he waited , his lips parted softly . I stood leaning there for a long moment , staring into his eyes . Then I grinned . The smile fell off his face like a soiled rag . Sweat stood out on his forehead . " So long , " I said . " I leave you to dirtier hands than mine . " I backed to the door and opened it and went out . The front doors were unlocked . There was a roofed porch . The garden hummed with flowers . There was a white picket fence and a gate . The house was on a corner . It was a cool , moist night , no moon . The sign on the corner said Descanso Street . Houses were lighted down the block . I listened for sirens . None came . The other sign said Twenty-third Street . I plowed over to Twenty-fifth Street and started towards the eight-hundred block . No. 819 was Anne Riordan 's number . Sanctuary . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still holding the gun in my hand . And I had heard no sirens . I kept on walking . The air did me good , but the whiskey was dying , and it writhed as it died . The block had fir trees along it , and brick houses , and looked like a house on Capitol Hill in Seattle more than Southern California . There was a light still in No. 819 . It had a white portecochere , very tiny , pressed against a tall cypress hedge . There were rose bushes in front of the house . I went upP173the walk . I listened before I pushed the bell . Still no sirens wailing . The bell chimed and after a little while a voice croaked through one of those electrical contraptionsthat let you talk with your front door locked . " What is it , please ? " " Marlowe . " Maybe her breath caught , maybe the electrical thing just made that sound being shut off . The door opened wide and Miss Anne Riordan stood there in a pale green slack suit looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her face under the glare of the porchlight was suddenly pale . " My God , " she wailed . " You look like Hamlet 's father ! " The living room had a tan figured rug , white and rose chairs , a black marble fireplace with very tall brass andirons , high bookcases built back into the walls , and rough cream drapes against the lowered venetian blinds . There was nothing womanish in the room except a full length mirror with a clear sweep of floor in front of it . I was half-sitting and half-lying in a deep chair with my legs on a footstool . I had had two cups of black coffee , then I had had a drink , then I had had two softboiledeggs and a slice of toast broken into them , then some more black coffee with brandy laced in it . I had had all this in the breakfast room , but I could n't remember what it looked like any more . It was too long ago . I was in good shape again . I was almost sober and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the centerfield flagpole.  |p174Anne  Riordan sat opposite me , leaning forward , her neat chin cupped in her neat hand , her eyes dark and shadowy under the fluffed out reddish-brown hair . There was a pencil stuck through her hair . She looked worried . I had told her some of it , but not all . Especially about Moose Malloy I had not told her . " I thought you were drunk , " she said . " I thought you had to be drunk before you came to see me . I thought you had been out with that blonde . I thought  --  I do n't know what I thought . " " I bet you did n't get all this writing , " I said , looking around . " Not even if you got paid for what you thought you thought . " " And my dad did n't get it grafting on the cops either , " she said . " Like that fat slob they have for chief of police nowadays . " " It 's none of my business , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots at Del Rey . Just sand lots they suckered him for . And they turned out to be oil lots . " I nodded and drank out of the nice crystal glass I was holding . What was in it had a nice warm taste . " A fellow could settle down here , " I said . " Move right in . Everything set for him . " " If he was that kind of fellow . And anybody wanted him to , " she said . " No butler , " I said . " That makes it tough . " She flushed . " But you  --  you 'd rather get your head beaten to a pulp and your arm riddled with dope needles and your chin used for a backboard in a basketball game . God knows there 's enough of it . " I did n't say anything . I was too tired . At least , " she said , you had the brains to look in those mouthpieces . The way you talked over on Aster " But the jewel robbery had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a connection with the jewel robbery . " Her eyes were a little sly . " I bet you feel awful , " she said . " Would n't you like to go to bed ? " " Here ? " She flushed to the roots of her hair . Her chin stuck out . " That was the idea . I 'm not a child . Who the devil cares what I do or when or how ? " I put my glass aside and stood up . " One of my rare moments of delicacy is coming over me , " I said . " Will you drive me to a taxi stand , if you 're not too tired ? " " You damned sap , " she said angrily . " You 've been beaten to a pulp and shot full of God knows how many kinds of narcotics and I suppose all you need is a night 's sleep to get up bright and early and start out being a detective again . " " I thought I 'd sleep a little late . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool ! " I shuddered . " Listen , " I said . " I 'm not very clearheadedtonight and I do n't think I ought to linger around here too long . I have n't a thing on any of these people that I could prove , but they seem to dislike me . Whatever I might say would be my word against the law , and the law in this town seems to be pretty rotten . " " " It 's a nice town , " she said sharply , a little breathlessly . " You ca n't judge  --  " " Okey , it 's a nice town . So is Chicago . You could live there a long time and not see a Tommygun . Sure , it 's a nice town . It 's probably no crookeder than Los Angeles . But you can only buy a piece of a big city . You can buy a town this size all complete , with the original box and tissue paper . That 's the difference . And that makes me want out . " P178She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll go to bed now and right here . I have a spare bedroom and you can turn right in and  --  " " Promise to lock your door ? " She flushed and bit her lip . " Sometimes I think you 're a world-beater , " she said , " and sometimes I think you 're the worst heel I ever met . " " On either count would you run me over to where I can get a taxi ? " " You 'll stay here , " she snapped . " You 're not fit . You 're a sick man . " " I 'm not too sick to have my brain picked , " I said nastily . She ran out of the room so fast she almost tripped over the two steps from the living room up to the hall . She came back in nothing flat with a long flannel coat on over her slack suit and no hat and her reddish hair lookingas mad as her face . She opened a side door and threw it away from her , bounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A garage door made a faint sound lifting . A car door opened and slammed shut again . The starter ground and the motor caught and the lights flared past the open French door of the living room . I picked my hat out of a chair and switched off a couple of lamps and saw that the French door had a Yale lock . I looked back a moment before I closed the door . It was a nice room . It would be a nice room to wear slippers in . I shut the door and the little car slid up beside me and I went around behind it to get in . She drove me all the way home , tight-lipped , angry . She drove like a fury . When I got out in front of my apartment house she said good-night in a frosty voiceP179and swirled the little car in the middle of the street and was gone before I could get my keys out of my pocket . They locked the lobby door at eleven . I unlocked it and passed into the always musty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I rode up to my floor . Bleak light shone along it . Milk bottles stood in front of service doors . The red fire door loomed at the back . I t had an open screen that let in a lazy trickle of air that never quite swept the cooking smell out . I was Iome in a sleeping world , a world as harmless as a sleepingcat . I unlocked the door of my apartment and went in and sniffed the smell of it , just standing there , against the door for a little while before I put the light on . A homely smell , a smell of dust and tobacco smoke , the smell of a world where men live , and keep on living . I undressed and went to bed . I had nightmares and woke out of them sweating . But in the morning I was a well man again . I was sitting on the side of my bed in my pajamas , thinkingabout getting up , but not yet committed . I did n't feel very well , but I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as sick as I would feel if I had a salaried job . My head hurt and felt large and hot and my tongue was dry and had gravel on it and my throat was stiff and my jaw was not untender . But I had had worse mornings . It was a gray morning with high fog , not yet warm but likely to be . I heaved up off the bed and rubbed the pit of my stomach where it was sore from vomiting . My leftP180foot felt fine . It did n't have an ache in it . So I had to kick the corner of the bed with it . I was still swearing when there was a sharp tap at the door , the kind of bossy knock that makes you want to open the door two inches , emit the succulent raspberryand slam it again . I opened it a little wider than two inches . **26;6203;TOOLONG stood there , in a brown gabardine suit , with a pork pie lightweight felt on his head , very neat and clean and solemn and with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightly and I stepped away from it . He came in and closed it and looked around . " I 've been looking for you for two days , " he said . He did n't look at me . His eyes measured the room . " I 've been sick . " He walked around with a light springy step , his creamy gray hair shining , his hat under his arm now , his hands in his pockets . He was n't a very big man for a cop . He took one hand out of his pocket and placed the hat carefully on top of some magazines . " Not here , " he said . " In a hospital . " " Which hospital ? " " A pet hospital . " He jerked as if I had slapped his face . Dull color showed behind his skin . " A little early in the day , is n't it  --  for that sort of thing ? " I did n't say anything . I lit a cigarette . I took one draw on it and sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cure for lads like you , is there ? " he said . " Exceptto throw you in the sneezer . " " I 've been a sick man and I have n't had my morningP181coffee . You ca n't expect a very high grade of wit . " " I told you not to work on this case . " " You 're not God . You 're not even Jesus Christ . " I took another drag on the cigarette . Somewhere down inside me felt raw , but I liked it a little better . " You 'd be amazed how much trouble I could make you . " Probably . " " Do you know why I have n't done it so far ? " " Yeah . " " Why ? " He was leaning over a little , sharp as a terrier , with that stony look in his eyes they all get sooner or later . " You could n't find me . " He leaned back and rocked on his heels . His face shone a little . " I thought you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And if you said it , I was going to smack you on the button . " " Twenty million dollars would n't scare you . But you might get orders . " He breathed hard , with his mouth a little open . Very slowly he got a package of cigarettes out of his pocket and tore the wrapper . His fingers were trembling a little . He put a cigarette between his lips and went over to my magazine table for a match folder . He lit the cigarette carefully , put the match in the ashtray and not on the floor , and inhaled . " I gave you some advice over the telephone the other clay , " he said . " Thursday . " " Friday . " " Yes  --  Friday . It did n't take . I can understand why . But I did n't know at that time you had been holding out evidence . I was just recommending a line of action that seemed like a good idea in this case . "  | " What evidence ? " He stared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I asked . " It might make you human . " " " No . " " I will . " I stood up and started for the kitchenette . " Sit down , " Randall snapped . " I 'm far from through . " I kept on going out to the kitchenette , ran some water into the kettle and put it on the stove . I took a drink of cold water from the faucet , then another . I came back with a third glass in my hand to stand in the doorway and look at him . He had n't moved . The veil of his smoke was almost a solid thing to one side of him . He was looking at the floor . " Why was it wrong to go to Mrs. Grayle when she sent for me ? " I asked . " I was n't talking about that " " Yeah , but you were just before " " She did n't send for you . " His eyes lifted and had the stony look still . And the flush still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and talked about scandal and practically blackmailed yourself into a job . " " Funny . As I remember it , we did n't even talk job . I did n't think there was anything in her story . I mean , anything to get my teeth into . Nowhere to start . And of course I supposed she had already told it to you . " " She had . That beer joint on Santa Monica is a crook hideout . But that does n't mean anything . I could n't get a thing there . The hotel across the street smells too . Nobody we want . Cheap punks . " " She tell you I forced myself on her ? " He dropped his eyes a little . " No . " I grinned . " Have some coffee ? "  | " No . " I went back into the kitchenette and made the coffee and waited for it to drip . Randall followed me out this time and stood in the doorway himself . " This jewel gang has been working in Hollywood and around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " They went too far this time . They killed a man . I think I know why . " " Well , if it 's a gang job and you break it , that will be the first gang murder solved since I lived in the town . And I could name and describe at least a dozen . " " It 's nice of you to say that , Marlowe . " " Correct me if I 'm wrong . " " Damn it , " he said irritably . " You 're not wrong . There were a couple solved for the record , but they were just rappers . Some punk took it for the high pil-low . " " Yeah . Coffee ? " " If I drink some , will you talk to me decently , man to man , without wise-cracking ? " " I 'll try . I do n't promise to spill all my ideas . " " I can do without those , " he said acidly . " That 's a nice suit you 're wearing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit cost twentyseven-fifty , " he snapped . " Oh Christ , a sensitive cop , " I said , and went back to the stove . " That smells good . How do you make it ? " I poured . " French drip . Coarse ground coffee . No filter papers . " I got the sugar from the closet and the cream from the refrigerator . We sat down on opposite sides of the nook . " Was that a gag , about you 're being sick , in a hos-pital ? "   " No gag . I ran into a little trouble  --  down in Bay City . They took me in . Not the cooler , a private dope and liquor cure . " His eyes got distant . " Bay City , eh ? You like it the hard way , do n't you , Marlowe ? " " It 's not that I like it the hard way . It 's that I get it that way . But nothing like this before . I 've been sapped twice , the second time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one and claimed to be one . I 've been beaten with my own gun and choked by a tough Indian . I 've been thrown unconscious into this dope hospital and kept there locked up and part of the time probably strapped down . And I could n't prove any of it , except that I actually do have quite a nice collection of bruises and my left arm has been needled plenty . " He stared hard at the corner of the table . " In Bay City , " he said slowly . " The name 's like a song . A song in a dirty bathtub . " " What were you doing down there ? " " I did n't go down there . These cops took me over the line . I went to see a guy in Stillwood Heights . That 's in L. A. " " A man named Jules Amthor , " he said quietly . " Why did you swipe those cigarettes ? " I looked into my cup . The damned little fool . " It looked funny , him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it . It seems they make them up like Russiancigarettes down in Bay City with hollow mouthpiecesand the Romanoff arms and everything . " He pushed his empty cup at me and I refilled it . His eyes were going over my face line by line , corpuscle by corpuscle , like Sherlock Holmes with his magnifying glass or Thorndyke with his pocket lens . " You ought to have told me , " he said bitterly . HeP185sipped and wiped his lips with one of those fringed things they give you in apartment houses for napkins . " But you did n't swipe them . The girl told Inc . " " Aw well , hell , " I said . " A guy never gets to do anything in this country any more . Always would ) . " " She likes you , " Randall said , like a polite FBI mail in a movie , a little sad , but very manly . " Her old man was as straight a cop as ever lost a job . She had no business taking those things . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not my type . " " You do n't like them nice ? " He had another cigarette going . The smoke was being fanned away from his face 1 ) y his hand . " I like smooth shiny girls , hardboiled and loaded with sin . " They take you to the cleaners , " Randall said indifferently . " Sure . - Where else have I ever been ? What do you call this session ? " He smiled his first smile of the day . He probably allowed himself four . " I 'm not getting much out of you , " he said . " I 'll give you a theory , but you are probably way ahead of me on it . This Marriott was a blackmailer of women , because Mrs. Grayle just about told me so . But he was something else . He was the finger man for the jewel mob . The society finger , the boy who would cultivatethe victims and set the stage . He would cultivate women he could take out , get to know them pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It smells . If Marriott had n't been driving the car , or had n't taken Mrs. Grayle to the Troc or had n't gone home the way he did , past that beer parlor , the holdup could n't have been brought off . "   " The chauffeur could have been driving , " Randall said reasonably . " But that would n't have changed things much . Chauffeurs are not getting themselves pushed in the face with lead bullets by holdup men  --  for ninety a month . But there could n't be many stick-ups with Marriottalone with women or things would get talked about . " " The whole point of this kind of racket is that things are not talked about , " I said . " In consideration for that the stuff is sold back cheap . " Randall leaned back and shook his head . " You 'll have to do better than that to interest me . Women talk about anything . It would get around that this Marriott was a kind of tricky guy to go out with . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Randall stared at me woodenly . His spoon was stirringair in an empty cup . I reached over and he waved the pot aside . " Go on with that one , " he said . " They used him up . His usefulness was exhausted . It was about time for him to get talked about a little , as you suggest . But you do n't quit in those rackets and you do n't get your time . So this last holdup was just that for him  --  the last . Look , they really asked very little for the jade considering its value . And Marriott handled the contact . But all the same Marriott was scared . At the last moment he thought he had better not go alone . And he figured a little trick that if anything did happen to him , something on him would point to a man , a man quite ruthless and clever enough to be the brains of that sort of mob , and a man in an unusual position to get information about rich women . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Randall shook his head . " A gang would have strippedP187him , perhaps even have taken the body out to sea and dumped it . " " No . They wanted the job to look amateurish . They wanted to stay in business . They probably have another finger lined up , " I said . Randall still shook his head . " The man these cigarettespointed to is not the type . He has a good racket of his own . I 've inquired . What did you think of him ? " His eyes were too blank , much too blank . I said : " I le looked pretty damn deadly to me . And there 's no such thing as too much money , is there ? And after all his psychic racket is a temporary racket for any one place . He has a vogue and everybody goes to him and after a while the vogue dies down and the business is licking its shoes . That is , if he 's a psychic and nothing else . Just like movie stars . Give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But give him a couple of ways to use the informationhe must get out of these women and he 's going to make a killing . " " I 'll look him up more thoroughly , " Randall said with the blank look . " But right now I 'm more interested in Marriott . Let 's go back farther  --  much farther . To how you got to know him . " " He just called me up . Picked my name out of the phone book . He said so , at any rate . " " He had your card . " I looked surprised . " Sure . I 'd forgotten that . " " Did you ever wonder why he picked your name  --  ignoring that matter of your short memory ? " I stared at him across the top of my coffee cup . I was beginning to like him . He had a lot behind his vest besides his shirt . " So that 's what you really came up for ? " I said . P188He nodded . " The rest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politely at me and waited . I poured some more coffee . Randall leaned over sideways and looked along the cream-colored surface of the table . " A little dust , " he said absently , then straightened up and looked me in the eye . " Perhaps I ought to go at this in a little different way , " he said . " For instance , I think your hunch about Marriott is probably right . There 's twenty-three grand in currency in his safe-deposit box  --  which we had a hell of a time to locate , by the way . There are also some pretty fair bonds and a trust deed to a property on West FiftyfourthPlace . " He picked a spoon up and rapped it lightly on the edge of his saucer and smiled . " That interest you ? " he asked mildly . " The number was 1644 West Fifty-fourth Place . " " Yeah , " I said thickly . " Oh , there was quite a bit of jewelry in Marriott 's box too  --  pretty good stuff . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very likely given to him . That 's one up for you . He was afraid to sell it  --  on account of the associationof thought in his own mind . " I nodded . " He 'd feel as if it was stolen . " " Yes . Now that trust deed did n't interest me at all at first , but here 's how it works . It 's what you fellows are up against in police work . We get all the homicide and doubtful death reports from outlying districts . We 're supposed to read them the same day . That 's a rule , like you should n't search without a warrant or frisk a guy for a gun without reasonable grounds . But we break rules . We have to . I did n't get around to some of the reports until this morning . Then I read one about a killing of a negro on Central , last Thursday . By a tough ex-con called Moose Malloy . And there was an identifying wit-P189Hess . And sink my putt , if you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his third smile . " Like it ? " " I 'm listening . " " This was only this morning , understand . So I looked at the name of the man making the report and I knew him , Nulty . So I knew the case was a flop . Nulty is the kind of guy  --  well , were you ever up at Crestline ? " " Yeah . " " Well , up near Crestline there 's a place where a bunch of old box cars have been made into cabins . I have a cabin up there myself , but not a box car . These box cars were brought up on trucks , believe it or not , and there they stand without any wheels . Now Nulty is the kind of guy who would make a swell brakeman on one of those box cars . " " That 's not nice , " I said . " A fellow officer . " " So I called Nulty up and he hemmed and hawed around and spit a few times and then he said you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other that Malloy was sweet on a long time ago and you went to see the widow of the guy that used to own the dive where the killing happened when it was a white joint , and where Malloy and the girl both worked at that time . And her address was 1644 West Fifty-fourth Place , the place Marriott had the trust deed on . " " Yes ? " " So I just thought that was enough coincidence for one morning , " Randall said . " And here I am . And so far I 've been pretty nice about it . " " The trouble is , " I said , " it looks like more than it is . This Velma girl is dead , according to Mrs. Florian . I have her photo . " I went into the living room and reached into my suitcoatand my hand was in midair when it began to feel funny and empty . But they had n't even taken the photos . I got them out and took them to the kitchen and tossed the Pierrot girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Nobody I ever saw , " he said . " That another one ? " " No , this is a newspaper still of Mrs. Grayle . Anne Riordan got it . " He looked at it and nodded . " For twenty million , I 'd marry her myself . " " There 's something I ought to tell you , " I said . " Last night I was so damn mad I had crazy ideas about going down there and trying to bust it alone . This hospital is at Twenty-third and Descanso in Bay City . It 's run by a man named Sonderborg who says he 's a doctor . He 's running a crook hideout on the side . I saw Moose Malloy there last night . In a room . " Randall sat very still , looking at me . " Sure ? " " You could n't mistake him . He 's a big guy , enormous . He does n't look like anybody you ever saw . " He sat looking at me , without moving Then very slowly he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let 's go see this Florian woman . " " How about Malloy ? " He sat down again . " Tell me the whole thing , care-fully . " I told him . He listened without taking his eyes off my face . I do n't think he even winked . He breathed with his mouth slightly open . His body did n't move . His fingers tapped gently on the edge of the table . When I had finished he said : " This Dr. Sonderborg  --  what did he look like ? " " Like a doper , and probably a dope peddler . " I described him to Randall as well as I could . P191He went quietly into the other room and sat down at the telephone . He dialed his number and spoke quietly for a long time . Then he came back . I had just finished making more coffee and boiling a couple of eggs and making two slices of toast and buttering them . I sat down to eat . Randall sat down opposite me and leaned his chin in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go clown there with a fake complaint and ask to look around . He may get some ideas . He wo n't get Malloy . Malloy was out of there ten minutes after you left last night . That 's one thing you can bet on . " " Why not the Bay City cops ? " I put salt on my eggs . Randall said nothing . When I looked up at him his face was red and uncomfortable . " For a cop , " I said , " you 're the most sensitive guy I ever met . " " Hurry up with that eating . We have to go . " " I have to shower and shave and dress after this . " " Could n't you just go in your pajamas ? " he askedacidly . " So the town is as crooked as all that ? " I said . " It 's Laird Brunette 's town . They say he put up thirty grand to elect a mayor . " " The fellow that owns the Belvedere Club ? " " And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our county , " I said . He looked down at his clean , shiny fingernails . " We 'll stop by your office and get those other two reefers , " he said . " If they 're still there . " He snapped his fingers . " If you 'll lend me your keys , I 'll do it while you get shaved and dressed . " " We 'll go together , " I said . " I might have some mail . "   He nodded and after a moment sat down and lit another cigarette . I shaved and dressed and we left in Randall 's car . I had some mail , but it was n't worth reading . The two cut up cigarettes in the desk drawer had not been touched . The office had no look of having been searched . Randall took the two Russian cigarettes and sniffed at the tobacco and put them away in his pocket . " He got one card from you , " he mused . " There could n't have been anything on the back of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess Amthor is not very much afraid  --  just thought you were trying to pull something . Let 's go . " Old Nosey poked her nose an inch outside the front door , sniffed carefully as if there might be an early violet blooming , looked up and down the street with a raking glance , and nodded her white head . Randall and I took our hats off . In that neighborhood that probably ranked you with Valentino . She seemed to remember me . " Good morning , Mrs. Morrison , " I said . " Can we step inside a minute ? This is Lieutenant Randall from Head-quarters . " " Land 's sakes , I 'm all flustered . I got a big ironing to do , " she said . " We wo n't keep you a minute . " She stood back from the door and we slipped past her into her hallway with the side piece from Mason City or wherever it was and from that into the neat living room with the lace curtains at the windows . A smell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut theP193door in between as carefully as if it was made of short pie crust . She had a blue and white apron on this morning . her eyes were , just as sharp and her chin had n't grown any . She parked herself about a foot from me and pushed her face forward and looked into my eyes . " She did n't get it . " I looked wise . I nodded my head and looked at Randalland Randall nodded his head . He went to a window and looked at the side of Mrs. Florian 's house . Ile came back softly , holding his pork pie under his arm , debonair as a French count in a college play . " She did n't get it , " I said . " Nope , she did n't . Saturday was the first . April Fool 's Day . He ! He ! " She stopped and was about to wipe her eyes with her apron when she remembered it was a rubber apron . That soured her a little . Her mouth got the pruny look . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go up her walk she run out and called to him . He shook his head and went on . She went back in . She slammed the door so hard I figured a window 'd break . Like she was mad . " " I swan , " I said . Old Nosey said to Randall sharply : " Let me see your badge , young man . This young man had a whiskey breath on him t' other day . I ai n't never rightly trusted him . " Randall took a gold and blue enamel badge out of his pocket and showed it to her . " Looks like real police all right , " she admitted . " Well , ai n't nothing happened over Sunday . She went out for liquor . Come back with two square bottles . " " Gin , " I said . " That just gives you an idea . Nice folks do n't drink gin . "  | " Nice folks do n't drink no liquor at Old Noseysaid pointedly . " Yeah , " I said . " Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by again . This time she was really sore . " " Kind of smart guesser , ai n't you , young man ? Ca n't wait for folks to get their mouth open hardly . " " I 'm sorry , Mrs. Morrison . This is an important matter to us  --  " " This here young man do n't seem to have no trouble keepin ' his mouth in place . " " He 's married , " I said . " He 's had practice . " Her face turned a shade of violet that reminded me , unpleasantly , of cyanosis . " Get out of my house afore I call the police ! " she shouted . " There is a police officer standing before you , madam , " Randall said shortly . " You are in no danger . " " That 's right there is , " she admitted . The violet tint began to fade from her face . " I do n't take to this man . " " You have company , madam . Mrs. Florian did n't get her registered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . " Her voice was sharp and short . Her eyes were furtive . She began to talk rapidly , too rapidly . " People was there last night . I did n't even see them . Folks took me to the picture show . Just as we got back  --  no , just after they driven off  --  a car went away from next door . Fast without any lights . I did n't see the number . " She gave me a sharp sidelong look from her furtive eyes . I wondered why they were furtive . I wandered to the window and lifted the lace curtain . An official blue-gray uniform was nearing the house . The man wearing it wore a heavy leather bag over his shoulder and had a vizored cap . I turned away from the window , grinning.  | " You 're slipping , " I told her rudely . " You 'll be playingshortstop in a Class C league next year . " " That 's not smart , " Randall said coldly . " Take a look out of the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood quite still looking at Mrs. Morrison . He was waiting for something , a sound like nothing else on earth . It came in a moment . It was the sound of something being pushed into the front door mail slot . It might have been a handbill , but it was n't . There were steps going back down the walk , then along the street , and Randall went to the window again . The mailman did n't stop at Mrs. Florian 's house . IIe went on , his blue-gray back even and calm under the heavy leather pouch . Randall turned his head and asked with deadly politeness : " How many mail deliveries a morning are there in this district , Mrs. Morrison ? " She tried to face it out . " Just the one , " she said sharply  --  " one mornings and one afternoons . " Her eyes darted this way and that . The rabbit chin was trembling on the edge of something . Her hands clutched at the rubber frill that bordered the blue and white apron . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreamily . " Registered mail comes by the regular mail-man ? " " She always got it Special Delivery , " the old voice cracked . " Oh . But on Saturday she ran out and spoke to the mailman when he did n't stop at her house . And you said nothing about Special Delivery . " It was nice to watch him working  --  on somebody else . Her mouth opened wide and her teeth had the nice shiny look that comes from standing all night in a glass of solution . Then suddenly she made a squawking noise and threw the apron over her head and ran out of the room . He watched the door through which she had gone . It was beyond the arch . He smiled . It was a rather tired smile . " Neat , and not a bit gaudy , " I said . " Next time you play the tough part . I do n't like being rough with old ladies  --  even if they are lying gossips . " He went on smiling . " Same old story . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She started with facts , as she knew facts . But they did n't come fast enough or seem exciting enough . So she tried a little lily-gilding . " He turned and we went out into the hall . A faint noise of sobbing came from the back of the house . For some patient man , long dead , that had been the weapon of final defeat , probably . To me it was just an old woman sobbing , but nothing to be pleased about . We went quietly out of the house , shut the front door quietly and made sure that the screen door did n't bang . Randall put his hat on and sighed . Then he shrugged , spreading his cool well-kept hands out far from his body . There was a thin sound of sobbing still audible , back in the house . The mailman 's back was two houses down the street . " Police work , " Randall said quietly , under his breath , and twisted his mouth . We walked across the space to the next house . Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still jittered , stiff and yellowish on the wire line in the side yard . We went up on the steps and rang the bell . No answer . We knocked . No answer .   " It was unlocked last time , " I said . Ile tried the door , carefully screening the movement with his body . It was locked this time . We went down off the porch and walked around the house on the side away from Old Nosey . The back porch had a hooked screen . Randall knocked on that . Nothing happened . He came back off the two almost paintless wooden steps and went along the disused and overgrown driveway and opened up a wooden garage . The doors creaked . The garage was full of nothing . There were a few batteredold-fashioned trunks not worth breaking up for firewood . Rusted gardening tools , old cans , plenty of those , in cartons . On each side of the doors , in the angle of the wall a nice fat black widow spider sat in its casual untidy web . Randall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He shut the garage up again , walked back along the weedy drive to the front and up the steps of the house on the other side from Old Nosey . Nobody answered his ring or knock . He came back slowly , looking across the street over his shoulder . " Back door 's easiest , " he said . " The old hen next door wo n't do anything about it now . She 's done too much lying . " He went up the two back steps and slid a knife blade neatly into the crack of the door and lifted the hook . That put us in the screen porch . It was full of cans and some of the cans were full of flies . " Jesus , what a way to live ! " he said . The back door was easy . A five-cent skeleton key turned the lock . But there was a bolt . " This jars me , " I said . " I guess she 's beat it . She would n't lock up like this . She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than mine , " Randall said . He looked at the glass panel in the back door . " Lend it to me to push the glass in . Or shall we do a neat job ? " " Kick it in . Who cares around here ? " " Here goes . " He stepped back and lunged at the lock with his leg parallel to the floor . Something cracked idly and the door gave a few inches . We heaved it open and picked a piece of jagged cast metal off the linoleum and laid it politely on the woodstone drainboard , beside about nine empty gin bottles . Flies buzzed against the closed windows of the kitchen . The place reeked . Randall stood in the middle of the floor , giving it the careful eye . Then he walked softly through the swing door withouttouching it except low down with his toe and using that to push it far enough back so that it stayed open . The living room was much as I had remembered it . The radio was off . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . If it 's paid for . Here 's something . " He went down on one knee and looked along the carpet . Then he went to the side of the radio and moved a loose cord with his foot . The plug came into view . He bent and studied the knobs on the radio front . " Yeah , " he said . " Smooth and rather large . Pretty smart , that . You do n't get prints on a light cord , do you ? " " Shove it in and see if it 's turned on . " " He reached around and shoved it into the plug in the baseboard . The light went on at once . We waited . The thing hummed for a while and then suddenly a heavy volume of sound began to pour out of the speaker . Randall jumped at the cord and yanked it loose again . P199The sound was snapped off sharp . When he straightened his eyes were full of light . We went swiftly into the bedroom . Mrs. Jessie Pierce Florian lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with her head close to one end of the footboard . The corner post of the bed was smeared darkly with something the flies liked . She had been dead long enough . Randall did n't touch her . He stared down at her for a long time and then looked at me with a wolfish baring of his teeth . " Brains on her face , " he said . " That seems to be the theme song of this case . Only this was done with just a pair of hands . But Jesus what a pair of hands . Look at the neck bruises , the spacing of the finger marks . " " You look at them , " I said . I turned away . " Poor old Nulty . It 's not just a shine killing any more . " A shiny black bug with a pink head and pink spots on it crawled slowly along the polished top of Randall 's desk and waved a couple of feelers around , as if testing the breeze for a takeoff . It wobbled a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many parcels . A namelessdick sat at another desk and kept talking into an old-fashioned hushaphone telephone mouthpiece , so that his voice sounded like someone whispering in a tunnel . He talked with his eyes half closed , a big scarred hand on the desk in front of him holding a burningcigarette between the knuckles of the first and secondfingers . The bug reached the end of Randall 's desk andP200marched straight off into the air . It fell on its back on the floor , waved a few thin worn legs in the air feebly and then played dead . Nobody cared , so it began wavingthe legs again and finally struggled over on its face . It trundled slowly off into a corner towards nothing , going nowhere . The police loudspeaker box on the wall put out a bulletinabout a holdup on San Pedro south of Fortyfourth . The holdup was a middle-aged man wearing a dark gray suit and gray felt hat . He was last seen runningeast on Forty-fourth and then dodging between two houses . " Approach carefully , " the announcer said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has just held up the proprietor of a Greek restaurant at Number 3966 South San Pedro . " A flat click and the announcer went off the air and another one came on and started to read a hot car list , in a slow monotonous voice that repeated everything twice . The door opened and Randall came in with a sheaf of letter size typewritten sheets . He walked briskly across the room and sat down across the desk from me and pushed some papers at me . " Sign four copies , " he said . I signed four copies . The pink bug reached a corner of the room and put feelers out for a good spot to take off from . It seemed a little discouraged . It went along the baseboard towards another corner . I lit a cigarette and the dick at the hushaphone abruptly got up and went out of the office . Randall leaned back in his chair , looking just the same as ever , just as cool , just as smooth , just as ready to be nasty or nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few things , " he said , " just so youP201wo n't go having any more brainstorms . Just so you wo n't go master-minding all over the landscape any more . Just so maybe for Christ 's sake you will let this one lay . " I waited . " No prints in the dump , " he said . " You know which clump I mean . The cord was jerked to turn the radio off , but she turned it up herself probably . That 's pretty obvious . Drunks like loud radios . If you have gloves on to do a killing and you turn up the radio to drown shots or something , you can turn it off the same way . But that was n't the way it was done . And that woman 's neck is broken . She was dead before the guy started to smack her head around . Now why did he start to smack her head around ? " " I 'm just listening . " Randall frowned . " He probably did n't know he 'd broken her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Deduction . " He smiled sourly . I blew some smoke and waved it away from my face . " Well , why was he sore at her ? There was a grand reward paid the time he was picked up at Florian ' s for the bank job in Oregon . It was paid to a shyster who is dead since , but the Florians likely got some of it . Malloymay have suspected that . Maybe he actually knew it . And maybe he was just trying to shake it out of her . " I nodded . It sounded worth a nod . Randall went on : " He took hold of her neck just once and his fingers did n't slip . If we get him , we might be able to prove by the spacing of the marks that his hands did it . Maybe not . The doe figures it happened last night , fairly early . Motion picture time , anyway . So far we do n't tie Malloy to the house last night , not by any neighbors . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " Malloy all right . He probably did n't mean to kill her , though . He 's just too strong . " " That wo n't help him any , " Randall said grimly . " I suppose not . I just make the point that Malloy does not appear to me to be a killer type . Kill if cornered  --  but not for pleasure or money  --  and not women . " " Is that an important point ? " he asked dryly . " Maybe you know enough to know what 's important . And what is n't . I do n't . " He stared at me long enough for a police announcer to have time to put out another bulletin about the holdup of the Greek restaurant on South San Pedro . The suspect was now in custody . It turned out later that he was a fourteen-year-old Mexican armed with a water-pistol . So much for eye-witnesses . Randall waited until the announcer stopped and went on : " We got friendly this morning . Let 's stay that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest . You look pretty peaked . Just let me and the police department handle the Marriott killing and find Moose Malloy and so on . " I got paid on the Marriott business , " I said . " I fell down on the job . Mrs. Grayle has hired me . What do you want me to do  --  retire and live on my fat ? " He stared at me again . " I know . I 'm human . They give you guys licenses , which must mean they expect you to do something with them besides hang them on the wall in your office . On the other hand any acting-captain with a grouch can break you . " " Not with the Grayles behind me . " He studied it . He hated to admit I could be even half right . So he frowned and tapped his desk . " Just so we understand each other , " he said after a ruse . " If you crab this case , you 'll be in a jam . It may a jam you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But little by little you will build up a body of hostility in this department that will make it damn hard for you to do any work . " " Every private dick faces that every day of his life  --  unless he 's just a divorce man . " " You ca n't work on murders . " " You 've said your piece . I heard you say it . I do n't expect to go out and accomplish things a big police departmentca n't accomplish . If I have any small private notions , they are just that  --  small and private . " He leaned slowly across the desk . His thin restless fingers tap-tapped , like the poinsettia shoots tapping against Mrs. Jessie Florian 's front wall . His creamy gray hair shone . His cool steady eyes were on mine . " Let 's go on , " he said . " With what there is to tell . Amthor 's away on a trip . His wife  --  and secretary  --  does n't know or wo n't say where . The Indian has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people ? " " No . I could n't make it stick . " He looked relieved . " The wife says she never heard of you . As to these two Bay City cops , if that 's what they were  --  that 's out of my hands . I 'd rather not have the thing any more complicated than it is . One thing I feel pretty sure of  --  Amthor had nothing to do with Marriott 's death . The cigarettes with his card in them were just a plant . " " Doc Sonderborg ? " He spread his hands . " The whole shebang skipped . Men from the D.A . ' s office went down there on the quiet . No contact with Bay City at all . The house is locked up and empty . They got in , of course . Some hasty attempt had been made to clean up , but there are prints  --  plenty of them . It will take a week to work out what we have . There 's a wall safe they 're working on now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My guess is that Sonderborgwill have a record , not local , somewhere else , for abortion , or treating gunshot wounds or altering fingertips or for illegal use of dope . If it comes under Federalstatutes , we 'll get a lot of help . " " He said he was a medical doctor , " I said . Randall shrugged . " May have been once . May never have been convicted . There 's a guy practicing medicine near Palm Springs right now who was indicted as a dope peddler in Hollywood five years ago . He was as guilty as hell  --  but the protection worked . He got off . Anything else worrying you ? " " What do you know about Brunette  --  for telling ? " " Brunette 's a gambler . He 's making plenty . He 's making it an easy way . " " All right , " I said , and started to get up . " That sounds reasonable . But it does n't bring us any nearer to this jewel heist gang that killed Marriott . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't expect it , " I said . " By the way , Jessie Florian told me  --  the second time I saw her  --  that she had been a servant in Marriott 's family once . That was why he was sending her money . Anything to support that ? " " Yes . Letters in his safety-deposit box from her thankinghim and saying the same thing . " He looked as if he was going to lose his temper . " Now will you for God 's sake go home and mind your own business ? " " Nice of him to take such care of the letters , was n't it ? " He lifted his eyes until their glance rested on the topof my head . Then he lowered the lids until half theiris was covered . He looked at me like that for aP205long ten seconds . Then he smiled . Ile was doing an awful lot of smiling that day . Using up a whole week 's supply . " I have a theory about that , " he said . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was by the circumstances of his life a threatened man . All crooks are gamblers , more or less , and all gamblers are superstitious  --  more or less . I think Jessie Florian was Marriott 's lucky piece . As long as he took care of her , nothing would happen to him . I turned my head and looked for the pink-headed hug . He had tried two corners of the room now and was movingoff disconsolately towards a third . I went over and picked him up in my handkerchief and carried him back to the desk . " Look , " I said . " This room is eighteen floors above ground . And this little bug climbs all the way up here just to make a friend . Me . My luck piece . " I folded the bug carefully into the soft part of the handkerchief and tucked the handkerchief into my pocket . Randall was pie-eyed . His mouth moved , but nothing came out of it . " I wonder whose lucky piece Marriott was , " I said . " Not yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acid . " Perhaps not yours either . " My voice was just a voice . I went out of the room and shut the door . I rode the express elevator down to the Spring Street entrance and walked out on the front porch of City Hall and down some steps and over to the flower beds . I put the pink bug down carefully behind a bush . I wondered , in the taxi going home , how long it would take him to make the Homicide Bureau again . I got my car out of the garage at the hack of the apartment house and ate some lunch in Hollywood be- fore I started down to Bay City . It was a beautiful cool sunny afternoon down at the beach . I left Arguello Boulevard at Third Street and drove over to the City Hall . It was a cheap looking building for so prosperous a town . It looked more like something out of the Bible belt . Bums sat unmolested in a long row on the retaining wall that kept the front lawn  --  now mostly Bermudagrass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of three stories and had an old belfry at the top , and the bell still hanging in the belfry . They had probably rung it for the volunteer fire brigade back in the good old thaw-and-spit days . The cracked walk and the front steps led to open double doors in which a knot of obvious city hall fixers hung around waiting for something to happen so they could make something else out of it . They all had the well-fed stomachs , the careful eyes , the nice clothes and the reach-me-down manners . They gave me about four inches to get in . Inside was a long dark hallway that had been mopped the day McKinley was inaugurated . A wooden sign pointed out the police department Information Desk . A uniformed man dozed behind a pint-sized PBX set into the end of a scarred wooden counter . A plainclothesmanwith his coat off and his hog 's leg looking like a fire plug against his ribs took one eye off his evening paper , bonged a spittoon ten feet away from him , yawned , and said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second floor was lighter and cleaner , but that did n't mean that it was clean and light . A door on the ocean side , almost at the end of the hall , was lettered : John Wax , Chief of Police . Enter . Inside there was a low wooden railing and a uniformedman behind it working a typewriter with two fingers and one thumb . He took my card , yawned , said he would see , and managed to drag himself through a mahogany door marked John Wax , Chief of Police . Private . He came back and held the door in the railing for me . I went on in and shut the door of the inner office . It was cool and large and had windows on three sides . A stained wood desk was set far back like Mussolini 's , so that you had to walk across an expanse of blue carpet to get to it , and while you were doing that you would be getting the beady eye . I walked to the desk . A tilted embossed sign on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I figured I might be able to remember the name . I looked at the man behind the desk . No straw was sticking to his hair . He was a hammered-down heavyweight , with short pink hair and a pink scalp glistening through it . He had small , hungry , heavy-lidded eyes , as restless as fleas . He wore a suit of fawn-colored flannel , a coffeecoloredshirt and tie , a diamond ring , a diamond-studded lodge pin in his lapel , and the required three stiff points of handkerchief coming up a little more than the requiredthree inches from his outside breast pocket . One of his plump hands was holding my card . He read it , turned it over and read the back , which was blank , read the front again , put it down on his desk and laid on it a paperweight in the shape of a bronze monkey , P208as if he was making sure he would n't lose it . He pushed a pink paw at me . When I gave it back to him , he motioned to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you are in our business more or less . What can I do for you ? " " A little trouble , Chief . You can straighten it out for me in a minute , if you care to . " " Trouble , " he said softly . " A little trouble . " He turned in his chair and crossed his thick legs and gazed thoughtfully towards one of his pairs of windows . That let me see handspun lisle socks and English brogues that looked as if they had been pickled in port wine . Counting what I could n't see and not counting his wallet he had half a grand on him . I figured his wife had money . " Trouble , " he said , still softly , " is something our little city do n't know much about , Mr. Marlowe . Our city is small but very , very clean . I look out of my western windowsand I see the Pacific Ocean . Nothing cleaner than that , is there ? " He did n't mention the two gambling ships that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-mile limit . Neither did I. " That 's right , Chief , " I said . He threw his chest a couple of inches farther . " I look out of my northern windows and I see the busy bustle of Arguello Boulevard and the lovely California foothills , and in the near foreground one of the nicest little businesssections a man could want to know . I look out of my southern windows , which I am looking out of right now , and I see the finest little yacht harbor in the world , for a small yacht harbor . I do n't have no eastern windows , but if I did have , I would see a residential section that would make your mouth water . No , sir , trouble is a thing we do n't have a lot of on hand in our little town . " " I guess I brought mine with me , Chief . Some of it atP209least . Do you have a man working for you named Galraith , a plainclothes sergeant ? " " Why yes , I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . " What about him ? " " Do you have a man working for you that goes like this ? " I described the other man , the one who said very little , was short , had a mustache and hit me with a 1 Blackjack . " He goes around with Galbraith , very likely . Somebodycalled him Mister Plane , but that sounded like a phony . " " Quite on the contrary , " the fat Chief said as stiffly as a fat man can say anything . " He is my Chief of Detectives . Captain Plane . " " Could I see these two guys in your office ? " He picked my card up and read it again . He laid it down . He waved a soft glistening hand . " Not without a better reason than you have given me so far , " he said suavely . " I did n't think I could , Chief . Do you happen to know of a man named Jules Amthor ? He calls himself a psychicadviser . He lives at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . And Stillwood Heights is not in my territory , " the Chief said . His eyes now were the eyes of a man who has other thoughts . " That 's what makes it funny , " I said . " You see , I went to call on Mr. Amthor in connection with a client of mine . Mr. Amthor got the idea I was blackmailing him . Probablyguys in his line of business get that idea rather easily . He had a tough Indian bodyguard I could n't handle . So the Indian held me and Amthor beat me up with my own gun . Then he sent for a couple of cops . They happened to be Galbraith and Mister Blanc . Could this interest you at all ? " P210Chief Wax flapped his hands on his desk top very gently . He folded his eyes almost shut , but not quite . The cool gleam of his eyes shone between the thick lids and it shone straight at me . He sat very still , as if listening . Then he opened his eyes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquired , polite as a bouncer at the Stork Club . " They went through me , took me away in their car , dumped me out on the side of a mountain and socked me with a sap as I got out . " He nodded , as if what I had said was the most natural thing in the world . " And this was in Stillwood Heights , " he said softly . " Yeah . " " You know what I think you are ? " He leaned a little over the desk , but not far , on account of his stomach beingin the way . " A liar , " I said . " The door is there , " he said , pointing to it with the littlefinger of his left hand . I did n't move . I kept on looking at him . When he started to get mad enough to push his buzzer I said : " Let 's not both make the same mistake . You think I 'm a small time private dick trying to push ten times his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police officer that , even if it was true , the officer would take damn good care could n't be proved . Not at all . I 'm not making any complaints . I think the mistake was natural . I want to square myself with Amthor and I want your man Galbraithto help me do it . Mister Blane need n't bother . Galbraith will be enough . And I 'm not here without backing . I have important people behind me . " " How far behind ? " the Chief asked and chuckled wittily .   " How far is 862 Aster Drive , where Mr. Merwin LockridgeGrayle lives ? " His face changed so completely that it was as if anotherman sat in his chair . " Mrs. Grayle happens to be my client , " I said . " Lock the doors , " he said . " You 're a younger man than I am . Turn the bolt knobs . We 'll make a friendly start on this thing . You have an honest face , Marlowe . " I got up and locked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the blue carpet , the Chief had a nice looking bottle out and two glasses . He tossed a handful of cardamomseeds on his blotter and filled both glasses . We drank . He cracked a few cardamom seeds and we chewed them silently , looking into each other 's eyes . " That tasted right , " he said . He refilled the glasses . It was my turn to crack the cardamom seeds . He swept the shells off his blotter to the floor and smiled and leaned back . " Now let 's have it , " he said . " Has this job you are doingfor Mrs. Grayle anything to do with Amthor ? " " There 's a connection . Better check that I 'm telling you the truth , though . " " There 's that , " he said and reached for his phone . Then he took a small book out of his vest and looked up a number . " Campaign contributors , " ' he said and winked . " The Mayor is very insistent that all courtesies be extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book away and dialed . He had the same trouble with the butler that I had . It made his ears get red . Finally he got her . His ears stayed red . She must have been pretty sharp with him . " She wants to talk to you , " he said and pushed the phone across his broad desk . " This is Phil , " I said , winking naughtily at the Chief . P212There was a cool provocative laugh . " What are you doing with that fat slob ? " " There 's a little drinking being done . " " Do you have to do it with him ? " " At the moment , yes . Business . I said , is there anythingnew ? I guess you know what I mean . " " No . Are you aware , my good fellow , that you stood me up for an hour the other night ? Did I strike you as the kind of girl that lets that sort of thing happen to her ? " " I ran into trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  tonight is  --  what day of the week is it for heaven 's sake ? " " I 'd better call you , " I said . " I may not be able to make it . This is Friday . " " Liar . " The soft husky laugh came again . " It 's Monday . Same time , same place  --  and no fooling this time ? " " I 'd better call you . " " You 'd better be there . " " I ca n't be sure . Let me call you . " " Hard to get ? I see . Perhaps I 'm a fool to bother . " " As a matter of fact you are . " " Why ? " " I 'm a poor man , but I pay my own way . And it 's not quite as soft a way as you would like . " " Damn you , if you 're not there  --  " " I said I 'd call you . " She sighed . " All men are the same . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine . " She damned me and hung up . The Chief 's eyes popped so far out of his head they looked as if they were on stilts . He filled both glasses with a shaking hand and pushed one at me.  | " So it 's like that , " he said very thoughtfully . " Her husband does n't care , " I said , " so do n't make a note of it . " He looked hurt as he drank his drink . He cracked the cardamom seeds very slowly , very thoughtfully . We drank to each other 's baby blue eyes . Regretfully the Chief put the bottle and glasses out of sight and snapped a switch on his call box . " Have Galbraith come up , if he 's in the building . If not , try and get in touch with him for me . " I got up and unlocked the doors and sat down again . We did n't wait long . The side door was tapped on , the Chief called out , and Hemingway stepped into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped at the end of it and looked at Chief Wax with the proper expression of tough humility . " Meet Mr. Philip Marlowe , " the Chief said genially . " A private dick from L.A. " Hemingway turned enough to look at me . If he had ever seen me before , nothing in his face showed it . He put a hand out and I put a hand out and he looked at the Chief again . " Mr. Marlowe has a rather curious story , " the Chief said , cunning , like Richelieu behind the arras . " About a man named Amthor who has a place in Stillwood Heights . He 's some sort of crystal-gazer . It seems Marlowewent to see him and you and Blane happened in about the same time and there was an argument of some kind . I forget the details . " He looked out of his windows with the expression of a man forgetting details . " Some mistake , " Hemingway said . " I never saw this man before . " " There was a mistake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreamily . " Rather trifling , but still a mistake . Mr. Marlowe thinks it of slight importance . " Hemingway looked at me again . His face still looked like a stone face . " In fact he 's not even interested in the mistake , " the Chief dreamed on . " But he is interested in going to call on this man Amthor who lives in Stillwood Heights . He would like someone with him . I thought of you . He would like someone who would see that he got a square deal . It seems that Mr. Amthor has a very tough Indian bodyguard and Mr. Marlowe is a little inclined to doubt his ability to handle the situation without help . Do you think you could find out where this Amthor lives ? " " Yeah , " Hemingway said . " But Stillwood Heights is over the line , Chief . This just a personal favor to a friend of yours ? " " You might put it that way , " the Chief said , looking at his left thumb . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course . " " Yeah , " Hemingway said . " No . " He coughed . " When do we go ? " The Chief looked at me benevolently . " Now would be okey , " I said . " If it suits Mr. Galbraith . " " I do what I 'm told , " Hemingway said . The Chief looked him over , feature by feature . He combed him and brushed him with his eyes . " How is Captain Blanc today ? " he inquired , munching on a cardamom seed . " Bad shape . Bust appendix , " Hemingway said . " Pretty critical . " The Chief shook his head sadly . Then he got hold of the arms of his chair and dragged himself to his feet . He pushed a pink paw across his desk . " Galbraith will take good care of you , Marlowe . You can rely on that . " I " Well , you 've certainly been obliging , Chief , " I said . " I certainly do n't know how to thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Always glad to oblige a friend of a friend , so to speak . " IIe winked at me . Hemingway studied the wink but he did n't say what he added it up to . We went out , with the Chief 's polite murmurs almost carrying us down the office . The door closed . I tentingwaylooked up and down the hall and then he looked at me . " You played that one smart , baby , " he said . " You must got something we was n't told about . " The car drifted quietly along a quiet street of homes . Arching pepper trees almost met above it to form a green tunnel . The sun twinkled through their upper branches and their narrow light leaves . A sign at the corner said it was Eighteenth Street . Hemingway was driving and I sat beside him . He drove very slowly , his face heavy with thought . " How much you tell him ? " he asked , making up his mind . " I told him you and Blane went over there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and socked me on the back of the head . I did n't tell him the rest . " " Not about Twenty-third and Descanso , huh ? " " No . " " Why not ? " " I thought maybe I could get more co-operation from you if I did n't . " " That 's a thought . You really want to go over to StillwoodHeights , or was that just a stall ? "   " Just a stall . ' What I really want is for you to tell me why you put me in that funnyhouse and why I was kept there ? " Hemingway thought . He thought so hard his cheek muscles made little knots under his grayish skin . " That Blane , " he said . " That sawed-off hunk of shin meat . I did n't mean for him to sap you . I did n't mean for you to walk home neither , not really . It was just an act , on account of we are friends with this swami guy and we kind of keep people from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people would try to bother him . " " Amazed , " I said . He turned his head . His gray eyes were lumps of ice . Then he looked ahead again through the dusty windshieldand did some more thinking . " Them old cops get sap-hungry once in a while , " he said . " They just got to crack a head . Jesus , was I scared . You dropped like a sack of cement . I told Blane plenty . Then we run you over to Sonderborg 's place on account of it was a little closer and he was a nice guy and would take care of you . " " Does Amthor know you took me there ? " " Hell , no . It was our idea . " " On account of Sonderborg is such a nice guy and he would take care of me . And no kickback . No chance for a doctor to back up a complaint if I made one . Not that a complaint would have much chance in this sweet little town , if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough ? " Hemingway asked thoughtfully . " Not me , " I said . " And for once in your life neither are you . Because your job is hanging by a thread . You looked in the Chief 's eyes and you saw that . I did n't go in there without credentials , not this trip . "  | " Okey , " Hemingway said and spat out of the window . " I did n't have any idea of getting tough iii the first place except just the routine big mouth . What next ? " " Is Blane really sick ? " Hemingway nodded , but somehow failed to look sad . " Sure is . Pain in the gut day before yesterday and it bust on him before they could get his appendix out . lie 's got a chance  --  but not too good . " " We 'd certainly hate to lose him , " I said . " A fellow like that is an asset to any police force . " Hemingway chewed that one over and spat it out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sighed . " You told me why you took me to Sonderborg 's place . You did n't tell me why he kept me there over forty-eight hours , locked up and shot full of dope . " Hemingway braked the car softly over beside the curb . He put his large hands on the lower part of the wheel side by side and gently rubbed the thumbs together . " I would n't have an idea , " he said in a far-off voice . " I had papers on me showing I had a private license , " I said . " Keys , some money , a couple of photographs . If he did n't know you boys pretty well , he might think the crack on the head was just a gag to get into his place and look around . But I figure he knows you boys too well for that . So I 'm puzzled . " " Stay puzzled , pally . It 's a lot safer . " " So it is , " I said . " But there 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law behind you on this ? " " On this what ? " " On this thinking about Sonderborg . " " Not exactly . " " That do n't mean yes or no . " " I 'm not that important , " I said . " The L.A. law can come in here any time they feel like it  --  two thirds of them anyway . The Sheriff 's boys and the D.A . ' s boys . I have a friend in the D.A . ' s office . I worked there once . His name is Bernie Ohls . He 's Chief Investigator . " " You give it to him ? " " No . I have n't spoken to him in a month . " " Thinking about giving it to him ? " " Not if it interferes with a job I 'm doing . " " Private job ? " " Yes . " " Okey , what is it you want ? " " What 's Sonderborg 's real racket ? " Hemingway took his hands off the wheel and spat out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street here , ai n't we ? Nice homes , nice gardens , nice climate . You hear a lot about crooked cops , or do you ? " " Once in a while , " I said . " Okey , how many cops do you find living on a street even as good as this , with nice lawns and flowers ? I 'd know four or five , all vice squad boys . They get all the gravy . Cops like me live in itty-bitty frame houses on the wrong side of town . Want to see where I live ? " " What would it prove ? " " Listen , pally , " the big man said seriously . " You got me on a string , but it could break . Cops do n't go crooked for money . Not always , not even often . They get caught in the system . They get you where they have you do what is told them or else . And the guy that sits back there in the nice big corner office , with the nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them seeds makes smell like violets , only it do n't  --  he ai n't giving the orders either . You get me ? " " What kind of man is the mayor ? " " What kind of guy is a mayor anywhere ? A politician . P219You think he gives the orders ? Nuts . You know what 's the matter with this country , baby ? " " Too much frozen capital , I heard . " " A guy ca n't stay honest if he wants to , " Hemingway said . " That 's what 's the matter with this country . Ile gets chiseled out of his pants if he does . You got ta play the game dirty or you do n't eat . A lot of bastards think all we need is ninety thousand FBI men in clean collars and brief cases . Nuts . The percentage would get them just the way it does the rest of us . You know what I think ? I think we got ta make this little world all over again . Now take Moral Rearmament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got something , baby . " " If Bay City is a sample of how it works , I 'll take aspirin , " I said . " You could get too smart , " Hemingway said softly . " You might not think it , but it could be . You could get so smart you could n't think about anything but bein ' smart . Me , I 'm just a dumb cop . I take orders . I got a wife and two kids and I do what the big shots say . Blane could tell you things . Me , I 'm ignorant . " " Sure Blane has appendicitis ? Sure he did n't just shoot himself in the stomach for meanness ? " " Do n't be that way , " Hemingway complained and slapped his hands up and down on the wheel . " Try and think nice about people . " " About Blane ? " " He 's human  --  just like the rest of us , " Hemingway said . " He 's a sinner  --  but he 's human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Okey , I was just telling you . Maybe I 'm wrong . I had you figured for a guy that could be sold a nice idea . " " You do n't know what his racket is , " I said .   Hemingway took his handkerchief out and wiped his face with it . " Buddy , I hate to admit it , " he said . " But you ought to know damn well that if I knew or Blane knew Sonderborg had a racket , either we would n't of dumped you in there or you would n't ever have come out , not walking . I 'm talking about a real bad racket , naturally . Not fluff stuff like telling old women 's fortunesout of a crystal ball . " " I do n't think I was meant to come out walking , " I said . " There 's a drug called scopolamine , truth serum , that sometimes makes people talk without their knowing it . It 's not sure fire , any more than hypnotism is . But it sometimes works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out what I knew . But there are only three ways Sonderborg could have known that there was anything for me to know that might hurt him . Amthor might have told him , or Moose Malloy might have mentioned to him that I went to see Jessie Florian , or he might have thought putting me in there was a police gag . " Hemingway stared at me sadly . " I ca n't even see your dust , " he said . " Who the hell is Moose Malloy ? " " A big hunk that killed a man over on Central Avenue a few days ago . Iie 's on your teletype , if you ever read it . And you probably have a reader of him by now . " " So what ? " " So Sonderborg was hiding him . I saw him there , on a bed reading newspapers , the night I snuck out . " " How 'd you get out ? Was n't you locked in ? " " I crocked the orderly with a bed spring . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No . Hemingway kicked the car away from the curb and a solid grin settled on his face . " Let 's go collect , " he said.  | " It figures . It figures swell . Sonderborg was hiding hot boys . If they had dough , that is . his set-up was perfect for it . Good money , too . " He kicked the car into motion and whirled around a corner . " Hell , I thought he sold reefers , " he said disgustedly . " With the right protection behind him . But hell , that 's a small time racket . A peanut grift . " " Ever hear of the numbers racket ? That 's a small time racket too  --  if you 're just looking at one piece of it . " Hemingway turned another corner sharply and shook his heavy head . " Right . And pin ball games and bingo houses and horse parlors . But add them all up and give one guy control and it makes sense . " " What guy ? " He went wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see his teeth were biting at each other inside it . We were on Descanso Street and going east . It was a quiet street even in late afternoon . As we got towards Twenty-third , it became in some vague manner less quiet . Two men were studying a palm tree as if figuring out how to move it . A car was parked near Dr. Sonderborg'splace , but nothing showed in it . Halfway down the block a man was reading water meters . The house was a cheerful spot by daylight . Tea rose begonias made a solid pale mass under the front windows and pansies a blur of color around the base of a white acacia in bloom . A scarlet climbing rose was just openingits buds on a fan-shaped trellis . There was a bed of winter sweet peas and a bronze-green humming bird prodding in them delicately . The house looked like the home of a well-to-do elderly couple who liked to garden . The late afternoon sun on it had a hushed and menacing stillness .   Hemingway slid slowly past the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth . His nose sniffed . He turned the next corner , and looked in his rear view mirror and stepped up the speed of the car . After three blocks he braked at the side of the street again and turned to give me a hard level stare . " L.A. law , " he said . " One of the guys by the palm tree is called Donnelly . I know him . They got the house covered . So you did n't tell your pal uptown , huh ? " " I said I did n't . " " The Chief 'll love this , " Hemingway snarled . " They come down here and raid a joint and do n't even stop by to say hello . " I said nothing . " They catch this Moose Malloy ? " I shook my head . " Not so far as I know . " " How the hell far do you know , buddy ? " he asked very softly . " Not far enough . Is there any connection between Amthor and Sonderborg ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this town ? " Silence . " I heard a gambler named Laird Brunette put up thirty grand to elect the mayor . I heard he owns the Belvedere Club and both the gambling ships out on the water . " " Might be , " Hemingway said politely . " Where can Brunette be found ? " " Why ask me , baby ? " " Where would you make for if you lost your hideout in this town ? " " Mexico . " I laughed . " Okey , will you do me a big favor ? " " Glad to . "   " Drive me back downtown . " He started the car away from the curb and tooled it neatly along a shadowed street towards the ocean . The car reached the city hall and slid around into the police parking zone and I got out . " Come round and see me some time , " Hemingway said . " I 'll likely be cleaning spittoons . " He put his big hand out . " No hard feelings ? " " M.R.A. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . He called me back when I started to walk away . He looked carefully in all directions and leaned his mouth close to my ear . " Them gambling ships are supposed to be out beyond city and state jurisdiction , " he said . " Panama registry . 11 it was me that was  --  " he stopped dead , and his bleak eyes began to worry . " I get it , " I said . " I had the same sort of idea . I do n't know why I bothered so much to get you to have it with me . But it would n't work  --  not for just one man . " He nodded , and then he smiled . " M.R.A. " he said . I lay on my back on a bed in a waterfront hotel and waited for it to get dark . It was a small front room with a hard bed and a mattress slightly thicker than the cottonblanket that covered it . A spring underneath me was broken and stuck into the left side of my back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The reflection of a red neon light glared on the ceiling . When it made the whole room red it would be dark enough to go out . Outside cars honked along the alley they called the Speedway . Feet slithered on the side- walks below my window . There was a murmur and mutterof coming and going in the air . The air that seeped in through the rusted screens smelled of stale frying fat . Far off a voice of the kind that could be heard far off was shouting : " Get hungry , folks . Get hungry . Nice hot doggies here . Get hungry . " It got darker . I thought ; and thought in my mind moved with a kind of sluggish stealthiness , as if it was being watched by bitter and sadistic eyes . I thought of dead eyes looking at a moonless sky , with black blood at the corners of the mouths beneath them . I thought of nasty old women beaten to death against the posts of their dirty beds . I thought of a man with bright blond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was afraid of , who was sensitive enough to know that something was wrong , and too vain or too dull to guess what it was that was wrong . I thought of beautiful rich women who could be had . I thought of nice slim curious girls who lived alone and could be had too , in a different way . I thought of cops , tough cops that could be greased and yet were not by any means all bad , like Hemingway . Fat prosperous cops with Chamber of Commerce voices , like Chief Wax . Slim , smart and deadly cops like Randall , who for all their smartness and deadliness were not free to do a clean job in a clean way . I thought of sour old goats like Nulty who had given up trying . I thought of Indians and psychics and dope doctors . I thought of lots of things . It got darker . The glare of the red neon sign spread farther and farther across the ceiling . I sat up on the bed and put my feet on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on my feet and went over to the bowl in the corner and threw cold water on my face . After a little while I felt a little better , but very little . I needed aP225drink , I needed a lot of life insurance , T needed a vacation , I needed a home in the country . What I had was a coat , a hat and a gun . I put them on and went out of the room . There was no elevator . The hallways smelled and the stairs had grimed rails . I went down them , threw the key on the desk and said I was through . A clerk with a wart on his left eyelid nodded and a Mexican bellhop in a frayed uniform coat came forward from behind the dustiest rubber plant in California to take my bags . I did n't have any bags , so being a Mexican , lie opened the door for me and smiled politely just the same . Outside the narrow street fumed , the sidewalks swarmed with fat stomachs . Across the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of sailors with girls were coming out of a photographer 's shop where they had probably been having their photos taken riding on camels . The voice of the hot dog merchantsplit the dusk like an axe . A big blue bus blared down the street to the little circle where the street car used to turn on a turntable . I walked that way . After a while there was a faint smell of ocean . Not very much , but as if they had kept this much just to remindpeople this had once been a clean open beach where the waves came in and creamed and the wind blew and you could smell something besides hot fat and cold sweat . The little sidewalk car came trundling along the wide concrete walk . I got on it and rode to the end of the line and got off and sat on a bench where it was quiet and cold and there was a big brown heap of kelp almost at my feet . Out to sea they had turned the lights on in the gamblingboats . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came and rode back almost to where I had left thep175Drive I thought you had missed the whole thing . " " Those cards do n't mean anything . " Her eyes snapped at me . " You sit there and tell me that after the man had you beaten up by a couple of crooked policemen and thrown in a two-day liquor cure to teach you to mind your own business ? Why the thing stands out so far you could break off a yard of it and still have enough left for a baseball bat . " " I ought to have said that one , " I said . " Just my style . Crude . What sticks out ? " " That this elegant psychic person is nothing but a high-class mobster . He picks the prospects and milks the minds and then tells the rough boys to go out and get the jewels . " " You really think that ? " She stared at me . I finished my glass and got my weak look on my face again . She ignored it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And so do you . " " I think it 's a little more complicated than that . " Her smile was cozy and acid at the same time . " I beg your pardon . I forgot for the moment you were a detective . It would have to be complicated , would n't it ? I suppose there 's a sort of indecency about a simple case . " " It 's more complicated than that , " I said . " All right . I 'm listening . " " I do n't know . I just think so . Can I have one more drink ? " She stood up . " You know , you 'll have to taste water sometime , just for the hell of it . " She came over and took my glass . " This is going to be the last . " She went out of the room and somewhere ice cubes tinkled and I closed my eyes and listened to the small unimportant sounds . I had no business coming here . If they knew as much about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That would be a mess . She came back with the glass and her fingers cold from holding the cold glass touched mine and I held them for a moment and then let them go slowly as you let go of a dream when you wake with the sun in your face and you have been in an enchanted valley . She flushed and went back to her chair and sat down and made a lot of business of arranging herself in it . She lit a cigarette , watching me drink . " Amthor 's a pretty ruthless sort of lad , " I said . " But I do n't somehow see him as the brain guy of a jewel mob . Perhaps I 'm wrong . If he was and he thought I had something on him , I do n't think I 'd have got out of that dope hospital alive . But he 's a man who has things to fear . He did n't get really tough until I began to babble about invisible writing . " She looked at me evenly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was , I did n't read it . " " That 's a funny way to hide nasty remarks about a person , do n't you think ? In the mouthpieces of cigarettes . Suppose they were never found . " " I think the point is that Marriott feared something and that if anything happened to him , the cards would be found . The police would go over anything in his pockets with a fine tooth-comb . That 's what bothers me . If Amthor 's a crook , nothing would have been left to find . " " You mean if Amthor murdered him  --  or had him murdered ? But what Marriott knew about Amthor may not have had any direct connection with the murder . " I leaned back and pressed my back into the chair and finished my drink and made believe I was thinking that over . I nodded.
