Oklahomans had never heard such talk from one of their own leading educators . Said Laurence Hasbrouck Snyder , dean of the graduate college at the University of Oklahoma : " If universities , which are supposedly the epitome of culture and learning in our society , can not practice the principles of democracy and illustrate them by example , where in the world will they be illustrated and practiced ? " Dean Snyder is one of the nation 's top geneticists , and what he has learned from his study of heredity and what his university practices are two different things . Negro Ada Sipuel Fisher has been vainly seeking admission to the university 's law school . <P> The dean hoped that " in the very near future " the graduate college would be open to every " intellectually qualified ' ' Oklahoman , whatever his race. * His audience-200 faculty members-clappea . <P> * That would n't help Ada Fisher , since the law school is separate .                  @ @ @
