A 265-pound Army private named Burl Icle Ivanhoe Ives was making a great hit last week with A.E.F. boys all over the globe . In a new short-wave act called G.I.* Jive , short-waved from the Manhattan studios of OWI to all U.S. Army bases overseas . Master of Ceremonies Ives 's friendly small talk , familiar recordings and songs on the git-tar were just what the first sergeant ordered . <P> Big , blond Burl Ives was already a very busy soldier . In nine shows each week he mugged , sang , cavorted in the smash hit This Is The Army ( TIME , July 13 ) . Each morning he drilled with the rest of the cast on a vacant lot in Manhattan . Two mornings a week ( Sundays 8:45 a.m. , Thursdays 9:30 a.m . E.W.T. ) his strumming guitar and his warm tenor voice plugged the Army show over CBS . He took the daily Jive stint happily in stride . <P> Private Ives could remember other , lazier days . A onetime Eastern Illinois State Teachers College footballer , burly Burl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folk songs and singing them to folks . In Manhattan he met Songsleuth Sigmund Spaeth , who sent him to NBC . Ambling amiably up to a mike , he started off with Robin He Married a Wife from the West . But NBC listeners that warm June day in 1940 heard no more than the opening line . " Special bulletin , " the announcer broke in , " France has capitulated . ' ' <P> Soon afterward , Burl ambled over to CBS to sing on Back Where I Come From . A million listeners were soon tuning in regularly to hear the " Wayfarin ' Stranger . " Strumming a tentative chord or two , singing as though he were alone and were singing just to hear himself sing , Burl acquainted his listeners with such magic Americana as Sweet Betsy from Pike : <P> Do you remember Sweet Betsy from Pike <P> Crossed the big mountain with her lover Ike <P> With two yoke of oxen , a big yaller dawg <P> A tall shanghai rooster and one spotted hawg <P> hoodle dang fol de dydle hoodle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Army .
