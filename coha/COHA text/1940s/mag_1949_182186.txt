Columnists are a privileged class . When they run out of news and gossip , they can talk about themselves or each other . Last week , in the holiday news lull , they did . <P> New York Star Columnist John S. Wilson tossed Columnist Walter Winchell a 1948 award : " The hand-tooled , self-propelled backscratcher for the Most Excessive Narcissistic Applause . " <P> New York Sun Columnist George E. Sokolsky cited bludgeon-wielding Hearst Columnist Westbrook Pegler as " one Of the most competent reporters in American journalism . " Hearst 's New York Journal-American ran a half-page promotion ad to be sure that no reader missed the compliment . <P> Columnist Pegler got another kind of compliment from Columnist Eleanor Roosevelt . In her question &; answer column in the Ladies ' Home Journal , she was asked why her " big , strong American sons " did n't horsewhip Westbrook Pegler . Mrs. Roosevelt 's reply : " Why should they bother to horsewhip a poor little creature like Westbrook Pegler ? They would probably go to jail for attacking someone who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , he is such a little gnat on the horizon . . . " <P> Herald Tribune Radio Columnist John Crosby , reviewing New York Daily News Columnist Ed Sullivan 's television show , crossly asked : " Why is Ed Sullivan on it ? " He " wanders out on the stage , his eyes fixed on the ceiling as if imploring the help of God , and begins to talk about ' his very good friends ' . . . in show business . " <P> The Trib 's Sunday Columnist Lucius Beebe , appearing on radio 's Author Meets Critic , gave the back of his white suede glove to Saturday Review of Literature Columnist Bennett Cerf , for lifting other wits ' anecdotes . Said Beebe of Cerf 's newest joke book : " Really an autobiography of Jimmy Valentine . . . " <P> With all this intramural chitchat going on , it was only a question of time until a column was started to copyread the columnists . Three months ago , the New York Star launched such a column as an experiment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was planning to run " So They Said , " by Frank Columbine , three times a week . <P> Columbine is the Star 's pseudonym for slim Tim Taylor , 28 , a reporter turned freelancer . Taylor scans some 35 Manhattan columns a day in his Stamford , Conn , home and shows up at the Star only to write his column . He spends two-thirds of his time cross-indexing columnists ' items to find out such things as 1 ) how many errors are made , 2 ) whom the columnists talk about most , and 3 ) how they correct their mistakes without openly admitting that they were wrong . Wrote Taylor : Columnist " Sullivan got himself in hot water when he identified Joyce Matthews and Arthur Lesser as a ' stem twosome . ' Two days later he set the record straight when he disclosed the ' Arthur Lessers are celebrating their 16th wedding anniversary at New Haven . ' " <P> With a little rudimentary research , he is able to trip up columnists who do n't check their gossip . Thus when Dartton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Griffis , ambassador to Egypt , purchased the Brentano bookstores ? " Columbine answered him in print : yes , 14 years ago .
