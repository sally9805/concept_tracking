The war on Scandinavia probably cuts oft a peace-time market which bought American products to the tune of $700,000 a day- It also creates a new war zone which American ships can not enter under the Neutrality Act . On the other hand it may intensify buying ! of American war supplies and chemicals . Effect on inventories Perhaps the most encouraging effect of this new phase in the war from the domestic standpoint is the probability that manufacturers will atop further shrinkage in their inventories . The economic outlook here has been clouded by the expectation that inventories built up to two and a half year peaks in January and February would have to be reduced considerably before any expansion in activity would occur .

While this will not create any shortage for American consumers , since pulp rprOducera . in tlif - country and ' in dined* havk productive capacity ' simple for our % . Oorzrial effect on pulp priceriF may eventually be drastic. / Scandinavia has been a large exports pulp to England .

Pulp Prices Up In 1937 with a sharp spurt in domestic demand , pulp prices advanced from about $50 up to $85 a ton . Current price for No. 1 paper pulp is $61 a ton . Rayon pulp prices for the June quarter are 575 and $80 a ton , up $5 a ton from first quarter prices . Increased buying of chemicals for munitions may well result from the anticipation of more intense warfare . Already practically all of our domestic production of phenol and toluol coal tar products , which go into high explosives , has been contracted for , and chemical circles state that exports have been substantial . although such business is hard to trace . Phenol , made principally by Barrett Co. , subsidiary of Allied Chemical do Dye Corp .. Dow Chemical and Monsanto. is in growing demand for plastics and synthetic resin lacquers , so that any large sales made abroad would be likely to stiffen prices . So far , American chemical producers have been reluctant to accept war business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no reason why surplus supplies should not be sold abroad if the opportunity offers . American Scantic Line Principal American flag steamship line to be affected by anticipated new neutrality legislation which is expected to block off the Norwegian coast to United States vessels is the American Scantic Line , which services Norwegian ports .
