General Charles de Gaulle , leader of the Fighting French , is a tall , stern man without the dramatic appeal of Joan of Arc but with all her love for France . Last week it was considered virtually certain that he was coming to Washington . Rebuffed and dismayed by the U.S. 's " temporary arrangement " with Admiral Jean Darlan in North Africa , De Gaulle had a case to plead . <P> To the Fighting French , Admiral Darlan is a onetime Nazi collaborationist , and therefore a traitor . Lieut . General Dwight D. Eisenhower 's decision to recognize him ( in order to put a quick end to French resistance in North Africa ) is a blow to Fighting French prestige . They also deeply distrust the extent of Darlan 's present collaboration with the Allies . But the Fighting French , as Frenchmen , retain their Cartesian logic . <P> No fair-weather friend of France is President Roosevelt , at the moment a court of high appeal among those seeking French leadership . From Roosevelt , De Gaulle will probably receive the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not be tossed away to quislings . <P> To De Gaulle the final smashing of Axis troops in North Africa would sound like the overture to victory . A policy of opportunism has contributed to that goal in Algeria , Morocco and Tunisia . With the French Fleet gone and with Dakar in the Allied sphere , the situation has changed , and with it has changed the position of Collaborationist Darlan . To the Fighting French and to many thoughtful U.S. citizens , a continued policy of opportunism has grave dangers . Two U.S. citizens spoke up last week to say so . <P> Before 17,000 Canadians who cheered themselves hoarse in Toronto , Wendell Willkie urged forthright discussion of war aims and policies . <P> " I was a soldier in the last war , " said Willkie , " and after that war was over I saw our bright dreams disappear , our stirring slogans become the jests of the cynical , and all because the fighting peoples did not arrive at any common post-war purpose while they fought . " <P> From Pundit Walter Lippmann came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problems of Europe . Lippmann recalled that for 20 years Europe has fermented with incipient class warfare . Said he : " We face the tremendous risk that liberation will be followed by civil war , unless we are prepared to choose correctly and swiftly , as territories are liberated , the authority which the great powers will back to restore order and to negotiate the peace . The price of not choosing swiftly , and of not choosing correctly , those who embody the vital purposes of the emancipated peoples , will be the anarchy of civil war . "
