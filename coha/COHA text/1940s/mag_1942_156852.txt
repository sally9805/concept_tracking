The shouting over the chairmanship of the Republican National Committee quieted to a whisper . The early candidates had been wheeled out and promptly knocked full of holes . Now , in the last few days before meeting in St. Louis to name the chairman , G.O.P. leaders quietly hunted for a compromise candidate who could soothe ruffled tempers and prevent an open fight . <P> Wendell Willkie had apparently won his battle against the man who once seemed to have the chairmanship in his grasp : Illinois Committeeman Werner Schroeder , darling of the Chicago Tribune , of some of the Old Guard , numerous G.O.P. Willkie-haters and a group who merely liked Schroeder 's acknowledged skill as a political organizer . Wendell Willkie did not control enough committee votes to beat Schroeder : all he had to fight with were his convictions and his strength as a symbol of G.O.P. progressivism . At week 's end , that seemed to have been enough . <P> <P> Attention now turned to a man who seemed to some Republicans to be heaven-sent as a compromise candidate : onetime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is from Cincinnati , and it is the Midwest 's turn for the chairmanship . He is the law partner of Ohio 's Senator Robert A. Taft . At the 1940 convention , he captained the Taft-for-President forces , fought Willkie tooth- &-nail.; But afterward he became a director of the Associated Willkie Clubs of America , boarded the campaign train as an aide , was with Willkie constantly from early September until election day . Asked by a newsman last week whether he was an Old Guard or Willkie Republican , conciliatory John Hollister replied : " I 'm not anybody 's man . "
