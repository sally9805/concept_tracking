It was doubtful whether Joseph Sepp Froelich , sharp-eyed as he was , had ever noticed the quiet , unremarkable man who lived in one of the cottages , spent his time hanging around Sun Valley Lodge , watching the skaters during the indigo-shadowed afternoons , sitting in the caf through the starlit evenings . <P> But that quiet man had noticed Mr. Froelich . <P> Froelich was one of the handsome Austrian and German experts whom W. Averell Harriman had brought to Idaho to teach Sun Valley colonists how to ski . Mr. Harriman had imported yodeling German waiters and musicians too , but Froelich and the other Skimeisters , Tyrolean hats cocked on their heads , were the climatic touch . They whizzed around the towering cornices of the hills , swooped like eagles over the white slopes of the Sawtooth Mountains . The ladies loved them . <P> Froelich , in fact , had got himself married . His wife was rich Natalie Rogers , granddaughter of the late Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. banking partner Louis A. Heinsheimer . Frederick ( Friedl ) Pfeifer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , daughter of a socialite Salt Lake City banker . Sandy-haired Hans Hauser could have been married half a dozen times . But Hans was too happy-go-lucky for his own good , according to Froelich , who was able to give up the business of teaching clumsy Americans how to do " snow plows " and " stem turns , " and become a colonist himself . This season he and his rich wife lived in a hunting lodge a mile away from the inn . <P> The Skimeisters made Froelich 's lodge their rendezvous . They talked about the war . They talked about the National Open Slalom tournament on Mount Hood in 1939 , when some of them had refused to race until the Nazi flag was displayed with the flags of other nations in the lobby of Timberline Lodge . They talked about little Peter Radacher , who had since gone back to Germany to fight . Much beer , much talk flowed at the Froelichs ' . One day the talk suddenly ceased . In Washington , the Congress of the U.S. declared war . In Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government men scanned a long report , all the data which the quiet , unremarkable man , an agent of the FBI , had gathered about the Skimeisters of Sun Valley . <P> Last week , in the continental cafs , around the heated swimming pools , on the ski slopes , among the Hollywood stars and millionaires , the socialites and diplomats , the rich European refugees and playboys of Sun Valley , gossip was as thick as a blizzard in the Sawtooth Mountains . <P> Froelich , Pfeifer , happy-go-lucky Hans Hauser , four others had been whisked off to the Salt Lake City jail .
