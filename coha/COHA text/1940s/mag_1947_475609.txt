THE Sweetwater River , a pleasant mountain stream that falls into the basin of the Tennessee , cuts through McMinn County beneath a canopy of high tension wires . The people of McMinn County , like the taut , coppery wires , hum with subdued peaceful activity until they are disturbed ; and then , like the wires , they snap in a shower of sparks and violence . It took several killings , ten years of extortion and thuggery , a world war and an official invasion by legal gunmen to bring on the violence of August 1 , 1946 , and the bloody siege of the Athens jail . But when it was over , democracy was firmly established and authority once again rested with the citizenry . The people of McMinn County are God-fearing men and women . When the Robert E. Lee highway climbs out of the Shenandoah Valley , which can take its religioR or leave it , into east Tennessee on the road to McMinn the highway is sprinkled with signboards telling the godless wayfarers that " Jesus is coming soon " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McMinn itself is relatively free of such shrieking witnesses to faith ; McMinn 's religion is Methodist and Baptist , quiet , bone-deep , and sober . On Saturday afternoon when farmers throng the town , preachers are allowed to call sinners to repentance in the shade of the courthouseat the county seat . But most of McMinn meets God in the serenity of Sunday morning at the red brick or white board house of worship in peace and devotion . The church-goers have made liquor illegal , and Sunday movies are unlawful , too . Next to religion , politics is the most important thing . But until 1946 , religion absorbed so much of the spirit of right-thinking people that politics fell automatically to the bad . First , it was the Republicans . They had McMinn County for years and years . The Republicans would let a Democrat get elected now and then , but the sheriff was theirs and they held tight to the county trustee who disbursed funds and issued poll-tax certificates . Then , from 1936 , when Paul Cantrell won the election and established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten years of Democrats . PAUL CANTRELL , state senator from the McMinn area and boss of the county , was a medium-sized , bespectacled man of sallow complexion , a big head , and little neck . Cantrell loved two things : money and power . He had a nervous , fidgety way about him ; he rarely looked directly at a man when he talked to him ; towards the end , an armed deputy accompanied Cantrell as guard when he strolled through Athens , the county seat . Pat Mansfield , his sheriff , was a tall , handsome man from Georgia . Pat was kind to his family and gave money to his church . He might have been popular but many people resented the sour troop of plug-uglies he had recruited to be his deputy sheriffs . Pat did Cantrell 's bidding . The Cantrell forces were hard , well-connected people . Cantrell was allied with Burch Biggs in neighboring Polk County ; the pair were tied tight to the Crump machine , and Crump ran all of Tennessee . They were so close to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state legislature , was speaker of the house in the legislature of the State of Tennessee . T HE MACHINE bossed the county with a rough hand . The sheriff had sixteen regular deputies and about twenty or thirty other men he would deputize in " emergencies . " Three of the deputies had served penitentiary terms . One of them had been convicted of taking a little girl out and violating the age of consent . It was n't rape , but then it was n't good , either ; and God-fearing people like those who farmed and worked in McMinn did n't like it . When the deputies arrested they often slugged him until sensible . Nobody talked back much in public because it was n't safe . The deputies threatened to kill people they did n't like . They were brutal men , ready to beat , blackjack , or bully anyone . One GI who was home on leave during the war was shot and killed by a deputy at a public entertainment house near Athens ; a sailor home on leave was killed at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bootleggers were all tied to the machine . They paid off the proper people and operated punch-boards and slot machines , sold liquor , did as they pleased . As a matter of fact , if someone was in the pen the best way to get him out was to work through the small-time racketeers to get the machine to go easy . The take from the bootleggers and gamblers was n't the only source of revenue for the machine . The county was directed by fee-grabbers . A tourist comes riding down the highway ; maybe he has a bottle of beer . The deputies arrest him and take him to court . In the court is a little man , called " the informer , " who says he is a lawyer . He advises the tourist to plead guilty , pay his fine , and go his way . Sixteen dollars and a nickel . No one will ever know how many people paid their sixteen dollars and a nickel , over and over again , to support the sheriff and his deputies . The sheriff was paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got seventy-five cents a day for every man in jail that had to be fed . When a drunk was arrested , he was put back on the street next day with a clear head and an empty stomach , but the charge to the county was two days ' food at seventy-five cents each . In ten years , county expenses for the sheriff 's office had run to over three hundred thousand dollars . McMinn has an audit committee working on the books now . There was nothing that could be done about it , because you could n't vote the machine out of office . The machine had taken the county from the Republicans by a famous vote-grab in 1936 ; some people still tell how the last ballot box from a normally Republican precinct was fixed to show just enough lead to carry the county . From then on , no matter how people voted , the machine counted the votes . In the key districts when the polls closed the deputies took the ballot boxes to jail , or another safe place , and counted them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the results and always the Cantrell men won . There was nothing that could be done about that either . Appeal to the courts was useless ; the Republicans tried that but no suit-atlaw was ever won by the opposition . T MIINGS had been that way for a long time when the war came , taking thirty-five hundred boys from McMinn homes and flinging them across the face of the earth . Folks kept writing to their sons about affairs in McMinn County ; sometimes the boys would visit on furlough and then write to their friends in camps all around the world . There were four years to think about McMinn County , and Ralph Duggan , who was a lieutenant in the Navy , says he thought a lot more about McMinn County than he did about the Japs . Many were thinking as Ralph did ? that if democracy was good enough to put on the Germans and Japs , it was good enough for McMinn County , too . It got to be a saying in Athens : " Wait till the GI boys come home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were trickling back to McMinn from France and Germany and Italy and the Pacific . The people of McMinn say there is nothing but what some good does n't come of it and what happened afterwards in McMinn came from the war . The boys learned a lot about fighting and more about patriotism in the Army ; when they came home they were ready to do something about democracy in Tennessee . x FEBRUARY they set to planning . They I met secretly because the Cantrell forces had the guns , the blackjacks , and the law ; and the deputies could make life hell for anyone they could catch . Once in the summer campaign , they seized one boy , locked him up , took his poll-tax receipt from him , and then , threatening his life , made him sign a statement that no such incident had ever taken place . There were five GI 's and one civilian in on the first secret meetings . They decided that in the summer election for sheriff and county officials the GI 's would put up a complete slate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going out of office and Cantrell was running for sheriff himself . The veterans sounded out general feeling and in May they called a mass meeting . To get into the GI meeting you had to show your discharge papers , or your membership card in the American Legion or VFW . The veterans picked a non-partisan slate : three Democrats , two Republicans . Knox Henry , a tall handsome boy who had been hurt . in North Africa and ran a filling station , was the man for sheriff . He was Republican , but the county trustee was to be Frank Carmichael , a farmer and a Democrat . Carmichael had been a major in the war and was badly wounded at Saint LO . The other candidates were GI boys , too , except Charlie Pickel who had been in the first World War and had returned with his wounds to be a carpenter . Jim Buttram , a sturdy , solid chunk of combat infantryman , was to be campaign manager . Jim 's family had a grocery store in Athens and Jim was new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up speed . Ralph Duggan , who had come back from the Navy to his law practice , was legal adviser and they pored over the Tennessee Code to see what the laws allowed them . The business men who feared the Cantrell forces contributed money secretly . They were afraid to give openly because the machine could raise the taxes , or arrest them , or generally make life hard . But eight thousand dollars came into the campaign fund and soon loudspeaker trucks were rolling over the hill roads , the Daily Post-Athenian was carrying campaign ads , and the local radio station was putting out fifteen minutes of talk a day . Up and down the pockets and roads went GI 's calling meetings in evenings at schoolhouses or homes , begging , urging , pleading with everyone to get out and vote . It was n't hard to pin scandal on the Cantrell forces ; McMinn County had lived with the scandal for almost ten years . Nothing had been done about it for two reasons : first , the only alternative was the old Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the Cantrells always counted themselves to victory anyway . So over and over , like the beating of a drum in the darkness , the GI campaign chanted its theme : " Your vote will be counted as cast , your vote will be counted as cast . " " Everybody knew we were trying to do the right thing , " said Jim Buttram . " We had twelve public meetings and we knew they were damned good . About three weeks before elections we knew we had won the votes and the hearts of the people of McMinn County . But the hardest thing to do was to build an organization to help us see we got a fair count on election day . " The GI 's asked the governor for help ; but the governor was elected with Crump backing and was silent . They asked the Attorney General in Washington for help ; he did nothing . They made contact with the FBI office in Knoxville ; the FBI agent said he could n't do anything unless Washington told him to , and Washington was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ELECTION day dawned sweet and clear over McMinn County . McMinn num-bers twelve voting precincts but the decisive vote is cast in two townships , Etowah and Athens . Etowah is some ten miles in the hills from the main highway , but Athens , the county seat , is dead center . Athens sprawls fragrant and green about the old white courthouse ; the Robert E. Lee hotel sits on one side , Woolworth 's and a movie house on another , stores and offices on the other two sides . One block up from the courthouse lies the red brick county jail . Maple trees and green lawn surround the courthouse ; old people sun themselves on the benches , children romp on the grass , blue-denimed farmers stroll casually about buying supplies for home and land . Election day saw Athens an armed camp . As the voters came to the polls , they found the Cantrell machine in ominous demonstration of force . Almost two hundred armed deputies strutted about , pistols and blackjacks dangling from their belts , badges gleaming . The deputies were strangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help him , and the governor authorized him to get deputies where he could . The machine had turned up a sodden gang of plug-uglies , most of them from foreign counties , some from as far as Georgia . Fred Puett , the Chamber of Commerce secretary , said that they looked as though they were drugged ; their eyes seemed as cold and arrogant and hard as those of a band of Nazis . By the Tennessee Code of Law , each polling place must be staffed with watchers from both parties , and the GI 's had chosen boys of the best families , with the best war records , to stand as their representatives at each place . As the polls opened in Etowah , one of the GI watchers asked to see the ballot box opened and demonstrated empty as required by law . " Hell , no , " said one of the deputies ; an argument sputtered , a highway patrolman was summoned and Evans , the GI poll watcher , was hauled off to jail . At 9:30 trouble flickered in Athens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an unspecified federal offense , took him from his appointed place at the polls and put him in jail , too . At three in the afternoon Tom Gillespie , a colored man , appeared at the eleventh precinct complete with poll-tax receipt . " You ca n't vote here , " said the machine watchers . " He can too , " contradicted the GI spokesman . " Get him , " yelled one of the deputies and someone slugged Gillespie . Gillespie broke for the door and ran down the street . As he ran , a deputy at the door drew his pistol and shot him in the back . Gillespie was taken to the hospital . Fifteen minutes later , Bob Hairell , another GI watcher at the twelfth precinct , was in trouble . The machine wanted to vote a nineteen-year-old girl ; Hairell objected . One of the deputies settled the argument by pulling his blackjack and laying Hairell 's head open . Hairell was off to the hospital . The Daily Post-Athenian sent a reporter to get the story on Hairell . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions . A r POOR , the polls closed . In the eleventh precinct , the two GI watchers , Charles Scott , Jr . and Ed Vestal , were thrust to one side as the machine prepared to count the vote . Through the plate glass door of the polling place , the people could see the two boys penned in their corner of the large room . By this time , Jim Buttram , the campaign manager , had decided that the vote of the eleventh precinct was n't worth trading off against the lives of two of his men . Twelve armed deputies had cleared the sidewalk in front of the eleventh precinct polling place , but hundreds of people stood on the opposite side . They watched Jim and Mr. Scott , father of Charles Scott , cross the street to speak to Mansfield , the sheriff . Mansfield was sitting in a red 1946 Dodge . There were six men in the car . Buttram offered to give him the precinct in return for the release of the watchers . " Are you trying to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You go over and get them yourself if you want them . " " You would n't want me to get shot , would you ? " said Jim . A deputy sitting beside Mansfield lifted his thirty-eight from his lap and said : " Buttram , I ought to shoot you right now , you 're the sonof-a-bitch who started the whole thing . " Mansfield knocked Moses ' gun down and told him to shut up , he was doing the talking . Mr. Scott leaned over and said : " If you wo n't let my boy out of there and anything happens to him , you 'll have to pay for it . " Pat grabbed his gun , snarled " Let 's settle this right now , " and started to open the door of the car . Buttram slammed the door on him , and he and Scott hastily made their way back to the cover of the crowd . A few minutes later Neal Ensminger , the editor of the local paper , strode over to the precinct door to see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the deputies a question , the two GI 's in the polling place broke for safety . With his shoulder down , young Scott burst the door and pounded out , followed in a moment by Vestal . Bleeding , they ran across the street to the crowd as the deputies trained their guns on the boys . By this time women were screaming , children were crying , and the veterans ? still unarmed ? stood cursing and shouting from the opposing pavement . The deputies held their fire as the two boys slipped among the people . it was five now , and following their practice the Cantrell forces removed the ballot boxes of the eleventh and twelfth precincts to the security of the jail for counting . IIl PritE GI 's had promised to get the vote I counted as cast , and they gathered at their campaign headquarters around the corner to confer . As they stood in the street , two Mansfield deputies approached to break up the group . Otto Kennedy was watching from his tire store as the deputies walked up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just out of the Navy , and his brother J. P. " Bull " Kennedy , just out of the Army . " Pat Mansfield said he was going to give us a fair and square election , " said Kennedy , " and then we saw those sons-of-bitches from Georgia , walking around with their guns and badges , telling us to kiss their neck . They 'd put our boys in jail , they were running all over us . I stepped up to the door . I saw them coming . I just could n't take it . I said to my brother : ' Bull , let 's get them . ' " As the deputies stepped into the crowd , the GI 's closed about them . They hit hard and high and low . The guns were taken and distributed among the GI 's . Three more deputies , then two more walked into the crowd . All were disarmed and the guns handed out . The deputies were loaded on cars , taken to the woods , stripped of their clothes , and left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still indecisive and the Kennedys became cautious . They had struck the first blow ; they were vulnerable . Otto decided to go home , telling the veterans that if they decided to do anything the Kennedys were ready to come back ; otherwise they were staying away . Dusk was settling and the vets talked . A city policeman walked by to say that Mansfield was coming with tommy-guns and tear gas . Then something happened . F ROM dusk to dawn , the story of the siege of Athens dissolves into anonymity . The people had voted the GI ticket , trusting the GI guarantee of a fair count . Five districts which had been fairly tabulated by evening had already given the GI 's almost a three-to-one lead . But the ballot boxes of the eleventh and twelfth precincts were being counted in the jail . Tomorrow the Cantrell forces would have victory and no one would be safe . On the one hand , the Common Law says that every citizen has the right to prevent a crime or felony from taking place ; on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawfully deputized thugs seemed perilously close to insurrection . A very fine point of law is involved and Crump still runs Tennessee . Therefore , no man knows or tells who played precisely what role in Athens on the night of Thursday , August 1 , 1946 . Down the highway from Athens is one of the armories of the National Guard . By eight o'clock rifles and machine guns were held by dozens of the veterans . It was a quiet movement . There was no raving or shouting . They collected at their headquarters and gravely , under cover of darkness , walked the two blocks to the jail where the sheriffs had taken the ballot boxes . Behind the jail is a barbed wire enclosure . Facing it , across the street , is a low hill covered with vines and several houses and buildings . The deputies had made a mistake that the battle-wise GI 's recognized immediately : they had concentrated forty or fifty of their number in jail and left no reserves in town . The GI 's deployed in the darkness in a semicircle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vines , on rooftops . A veteran strode into the street and yelled at the silent jail a demand for the ballot boxes and the release of the GI prisoners . A voice answered , " Are you the law ? " The GI yelled back , " There is n't any law in McMinn County . " A lone shot went off from within the jail . The man that answered from the hill answered with a tommy-gun . There were several hundred veterans in the semicircle and hundreds of boys and civilians . Some had rifles , a few had tommy-guns , others had bird guns and hunting pieces . The fusillade rose and fell above the night , echoing into the suburbs and hills . Bullets spattered the Chamber of Commerce and the newspaper office a block away . A block down the road , a man standing on the corner of the courthouse square was nicked in the arm . The local radio station had sent a reporter with a microphone to cover the action ; up and down the county farmers tuned in to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , got their guns , came to join in the shoot . Boys too young to cock a rifle came down to see the fun and remained to learn how to shoot in the night . MHE deputies were safe behind the thick 1 brick wail of the jail , and the bullets of the GI 's could do no more than cut out chunks of the wall . As the sporadic shooting dragged on hour after hour , the veterans realized with a sick feeling that night was wearing away and , with daylight , state patrolmen ? perhaps even the National Guard ? might be called in to reinforce the garrison of deputies . Defeat would mean that McMinn County would ' never be safe again for any man who had taken part in the night 's firing . It was go through with it , or get out of town . At midnight a detachment went over to the county farm where a case of dynamite was located . During a lull , the veterans yelled that unless the ballot boxes and prisoners were released in twenty minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the jail made no answer . Somebody fitted a cap to a stick of dynamite and tossed it into the street . A second stick followed . On the third throw , two sticks were tied together and thrown across to the sidewalk of the jail . The fourth throw of two sticks landed on the porch of the jail and tore it wide apart . Somebody had learned about demolition in the war ; for the last try they decided to prepare a homemade satchel charge of the rest of the case and place it under the jail wall . But before the charge could be placed , the jail was yelling surrender . It was 3:30 in the morning . " We 're dying in here , " came a call . " Do n't use any more dynamite , we 're giving up . " No one was dying . Four of the deputies were pretty badly hurt and required hospitalization ; ten of the GI 's were wounded in the day 's action ; but the war was over . The vets ordered the deputies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their guns behind . As they marched out , the crowd gathered round , yelling , cursing , and booing . Someone in the crowd reached out with a razor and slashed at one of the deputies , laying his throat open . Duggan tried to stop the man ; the man explained that the deputy had arrested him before , taken him to jail and kicked in four of his ribs . Duggan tried to reason with him , but he made another razor pass . Then Duggan slugged him into obedience and led the deputy off to the hospital . Behind them a file of deputies , guarded by GI 's , paraded through the street to the courthouse and back so that the people might see and taunt their unthroned impotence . By this time dawn was lighting the county and the radio station , broadcasting at , victory , was bringing farmers in from all the hills to see what was happening . The state capital had been alerted and the State Commissioner of Public Safety , Lynn Bomar , called up to locate a GI to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Woods at the state capital . Woods , who was Election Commissioner of the county , promised ? if given a safe conduct ? to return to Athens on Monday and certify the election of the entire GI slate . Duggan announced the victory to the crowd at six in the morning and then went home . TIOLENCE flickered on for several more V hours . The GI 's had had their fill , but the civilians and boys were carrying on . They smashed in windows of the deputies ' automobiles , turned them over , burned cars indiscriminately . It was the GI 's now who had to restrain the civilians and protect their prisoners . By ten o'clock , however , the fury had spent itself and the GI 's were carefully escorting their prisoners out of town . At three , a giant mass meeting was held in the courthouse , men jamming the assembly hall , overflowing onto the steps and the lawn . The Reverend Bernie Hampton read the twenty-third psalm and asked the body of citizens what their will was . Someone suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till things settled down . The three-man committee was elected immediately and from Friday to Monday it conducted the county 's affairs on a volunteer basis . It summoned the county court ? the local legislative body ? to a meeting on Monday morning . The county court declared vacant the offices held by machine contestants in the elections and declared the GI slate duly elected . Six of the twelve precincts ' votes were thrown out entirely , for no fair count had been given there . When the GI 's broke into jail they found that some of the tally sheets marked by the machine had been scored fifteen to one for the Cantrell forces . Where the GI 's witnessed the count , the margin was three to one GI . Thus it was decided that only in those precincts where both parties had watched should the count be accepted . By Monday afternoon , Knox Henry was sheriff of McMinn County . and the law was safe . Mainoi is quiet and peaceful again . The courthouse has been painted for the first time in years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strikes the hours loud , clear , and free over the entire town . The jail has been repaired but it is curiously empty . Within a month Henry was running McMinn County with eight youthful GI deputies . Saturday night no longer filled the cells with fifty or sixty men waiting to be fined ; by the end of the month , Saturday night found only three men in jail . The four city policemen had been fired and replaced by veterans . Pat Mansfield was back in Georgia , working as a fireman on a railway . Paul Cantrell was in Nashville and did n't want to come back . The gambling joints have been closed down , the bootlegging ring has been smashed , fee-grabbing ended . There are no more slot machines or punchboards . Henry has pledged the new regime that the sheriff will live on his lawful salary . The GI party , too , has been disbanded , but a Good Government League has succeeded it . The Good Government League has branches in fifteen different communities of the county and is the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Cantrell men , but they do n't come up for election till next summer . Meanwhile the Good Government League suggests various actions to it , and the court pays heed . The first thing the county court was persuaded to do was to establish an audit committee . The Good Government League wants to see what resources are available for the two most pressing local problems : schools and roads , Schools are pretty bad in McMinn . Pay for teachers is so poor that all the best teachers are leaving . In some places in McMinn , teachers get eighty-five dollars a month for the eight months they work ; that averages less than fifteen dollars a week , year-round , as take-home pay . Even a waitress at the hotel makes more than that . Highest pay is at the high school and that comes to only thirty dollars a week for a teacher with a master 's degree . The Good Govern , ment League wants to divert money from the sheriff 's heavy budget to the education budget . When the schools and school buses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads . Maybe after that the League will move on to such long-range plans as a permanent county-manager system and a new structure of government . The GI 's like McMinn and they think they can keep it healthy . There will always be bootlegging unless the church people let the county make liquor legal . But now the government Will be master of the bootleggers instead of the bootleggers masters of the government . The GI 's say theyare n't interested in " issues " ; they are n't interested in unions or poll-tax laws or running the country . This was a McMinn matter , strictly a battle to give McMinn fair and square elections and force Boss Crump back to Shelby County . It is true , of course , that Crump still runs the rest of Tennessee and that Crump helped send back to Washington a man named Kenneth McKellar . And until November 1946 , McKellar was president of the Senate of the United States of America , called the greatest deliberative body in the world .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
