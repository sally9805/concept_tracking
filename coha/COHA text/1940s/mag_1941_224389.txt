Good reason had CBS to rub its corporate hands with delight last week as it watched its correspondent William Lawrence Shirer 's Berlin Diary nudging up to a sale of 400,000 copies . Keeping a baby spot trained on its former Berlin man , CBS since last July has had him covering home plate in its nightly European news roundups , named him last week to substitute for vacationing Commentator Elmer Davis . Meanwhile , plans were going ahead to feature him a fortnight hence on a Sunday-evening show ( 5:456 E.D.S.T. ) called William Shirer and the News . After three weeks as a sustainer , Shirer 's Sunday program will be taken over by Sanka Coffee at about $1,000 a week . <P> Big , mild-mannered , 37-year-old Newscaster Shirer , blind in one eye from a skiing accident in Switzerland , is a radio phenomenon . Before he joined CBS . in 1937 , he had an eventful , but by no means dazzling , career as correspondent for the Chicago Tribune and Universal News Service . High point of his career in foreign-news service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which netted a close friendship with Mohandas K. Gandhi . A product of that time was a novel about India . He did n't think about publishing it until he scored with Berlin Diary . Now several publishers are dickering for it . <P> When Bill Shirer was hired by CBS , he did n't expect to get far in radio . But his slow , earnest voice and competent reporting from the world 's political hot spots made his name . Now he is cashing in on the by-products of his reputation . Besides his take from writing and broadcasting , he is getting a fee reported to be around $20,000 for nine weeks ' work as technical adviser for an RKO film called Passage from Bordeaux ( adapted from a novelette by Budd Schulberg ) . Shirer was offered a small part in this refugee drama as a radio broadcaster but turned it down on the grounds that his screen face is depressing . <P> Busy as he is , Bill Shirer still has time for an occasional lecture , at a going rate of $500 . Added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diary , it all adds up , even after taxes , to quite a sizeable advance over the $150 a week which he used to average for airing the news from Berlin .
