txt After all the feverish weeks and months of promotion , proclamation and fanfare , the World 's Fair yesterday finally set the stage for its closing today . The aging Fair yesterday enjoyed an eleventh-hour attendance boom as thousands swarmed out to attempt to cover the great exposition in almost desperate haste . In the flurry of last-minute announcements , Fair officials had one principal message to hammer over to the public : today is the last chance to see the Fair . The crowds yesterday seemed acutely conscious of the approaching end of the Fair . Visitors seemed to move in double-time as they scurried from one exhibit to another . Bargain hunters swamped the souvenir stands , where prices of gimcracks stamped with the outgoing emblem of the trylon and perisphere were sharply reduced , while more ambitious customers rummaged through bazaars where costly products of the Old World are on sale . The paid attendance at the Fair was 364,578 , making yesterday one of the eight days of the 1940 season when paid attendance has exceeded the 300,000 mark . It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . The principal attraction for the crowd early in the afternoon was th ' personal appearance of Wendell L. Willkie in the Court of Peace . It was estimated that 50,000 persons jammed the area for a look at the Republican Presidential candidate .. Rush to Amusement Area The 1,500 New York City patrolmen and plainclothes men , who are to augment the World 's Fair police force of 348 to guard against vandalism on closing day , moved in yesterday but had little to do except to regulate the movements of the large crowds . One of the biggest rushes of the day was at the Magic Circle in the amusement area , where a free car is given away nightly to the holder of a lucky golden key . One contest official received hand burns in attempting to hold the rope behind which the crowds were lined up . One of the city policemen , Patrolman Arthur Torrett of the Fortyeighth Precinct , the Bronx , called in to help with the special guard duty , collapsed yesterday afternoon at his post near the Massachusetts Building . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of duty for the day . Early in the day , Harvey D. Gibson , Board chairman of the Fair corporation , announced the plan , hinted at last Saturday by Mayor La Guardia , for permitting visitors to enter the grounds on Monday under a special charity plan . The Fair will be open for six hours between 10 A. M. and 4 P. M. , Mr. Gibson announced . Any one willing to pay $2 will be permitted to enter by foot at the North Corona gate , the I. R. T.-B . M. T. gate , the Long Island Railroad gate and the administration gate , while automobiles , including their occupants , will be permitted to enter the grounds at the Colonial Avenue gate for a fee of $5 . All proceeds will go to the American Red Cross . No exhibits will be open , Mr. Gib-son explained , but the visitors will be permitted to wander about the grounds as they please , take last photographs and watch the beginning of the moving-out and demolition processes . Though the announcement included no mention of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fair officials hope that the idea of keeping the Fair open for a few hours Monday for the benefit of the Red Cross will discourage the idea of any vandalism on the part of last-day visitors . The police have been given strict instructions that no vandalism is to be permitted , as Fair officials are determined that the Fair shall close in an orderly manner . As previously announced , Fair officials are adhering to their plans for a simple closing ceremony . An Old Glory Mardi Gras parade , with floats carrying the " beauty queens " of the five New York boroughs , will provide the carnival touch at 7 P. M. ; then , at midnight , taps will be sounded from the helicline bridge of the theme center , and the Fair will be pronounced officially closed . The offices of the Italian Commission to the World 's Fair announced yesterday morning that the pavilion would be closed yesterday and today as a token of respect for Vice Admiral Giuseppe Cantu , Italian commisisoner to the Fair , who died Thursday night . The main entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Italian section in the Hall of Nations was closed . Visitors were permitted , however , to enter the building through a side entrance of the basement where souvenirs are sold , and a stairway leading to the main section of the pavilion was open . Workmen were already busy dismantling certain parts of the exhibit . Announcements began coming through yesterday as to the disposition of various of the important commercial exhibits . The Bell Telephone building 's exhibit will be sent throughout the country in units for demonstrations . The International Business Machines gallery of Science and art , composed of fiftythree paintings by American artists , also will go on tour throughout the United States . The Ford exposition announced that many of its prominent exhibits will be shipped to Greenfield Village in Dearborn , Mich. , for permanent display . Another accompaniment to the season 's end was the appearance of various Fair personalities , anxious to make their claims on the exposition . One such was August Lind of 733 Prospect Avenue , the Bronx , the all-time No. 1 Fair fan . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cable department of the I. R. T. subway division , walked into newspaper offices and announced : " After tomorrow I will have visited the Fair 355 times  --  once on each of the 355 days it was open in 1939 and 1940 . In 1940 alone . I walked 900 miles by pedometer , saw every exhibit ten times , spent 1,071 hours at the Fair  --  and about $200 . I wore out two pairs of shoes , eleven pairs of heels , thirty-one pairs of socks , lost seven and onehalf pounds and collected 105 pounds of free literature . " There was more to Mr. Lind 's story , but these were the main points . He said he planned to come at 9 A. M. this morning and stay until 2 A. M. Monday . Another item was the beginning of a " ricksha hike " from New York to California by three college boys - who have been chair-pushers at the Fair all season . The boys ? Homer Shank and Fred Berg of Los Angeles , and William Barry of Bayside , L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ninety days . Major Robert Laurie Eaton , who has been in charge of mimeographing , distributing and filing World 's Fair publicity releases since May 28 , 1936 , also came forward with the announcement that " since June 29 , 1936 , 5,085 separate releases have been issued from this office , totaling something like 6,000,000 words . " That , the major estimated , is " about two miles of publicity , or enough word to stretch from the top of the Trylon , down Constitution Mall to the Lagoon of Nations , where whatever is left over can fall in and drown itself . " The telephone company also produced one unwilling candidate for a Fair record  --  William Shostak. 21 years old . 333 East Ninety-fifth Street , who has " an aversion for publicity . " William , the telephone company said , holds the championship for winning free calls at the telephone exhibit  --  ninety-one calls in all . His nearest rival is a lad who has won sixty-seven . The majority of the " champ 's " calls have been to Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , is " a friend of the family's. "
