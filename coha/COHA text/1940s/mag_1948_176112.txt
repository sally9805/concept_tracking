For most people , getting up in the morning , even if not the happiest moment of their lives , is merely a routine matter . For some others , getting out of bed immediately makes it ten to one against them ; awakening brings an emotional hangover that has nothing to do with liquor. *The day ahead seems impossible and even death preferable .
