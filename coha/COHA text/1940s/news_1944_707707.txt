txt The city budget for 1944-45 will include a reduced appropriation for the Board of Higher Education , resulting in a cut of 26 per cent in Ifunds for the teaching staff at City College , a 13 per cent cut at Hunter and one of 8 per cent at Brooklyn College , Mayor La Guardia declared yesterday in a one-hour radio broadcast from City Hall , devoted entirely to discussion of the processes and problems of budgetmaking for the coming fiscal year . The Mayor declared that the slashes were mandatory under State law , on the basis of reduced enrollments since March 1 , 1943 . The law , the Mayor said , calls for an over-all cut , but he was " easing " the situation by making reductions applicable only to the teaching staffs , sparing the maintenance , operating and supervisory forces . " There may be a taxpayer 's suit on it , " he said , " but we will have to take a chance on that . " Mayor Looks Up Law The Mayor admitted he was taking his action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a luncheon the other day and some small-town people were invited . " " They gave some advice , " he said , " and the result was I locked up the law and found that I could not carry out the La Guardia plan as I did last year . " The La Guardia plan , he explained , contemplated establishment of a permanent teaching staff in the city colleges . The luncheon to which the Mayor referred was held on March 18 under the auspices of the Public Education Association , One of the speakers , Dean T. R. McConnell of the University of Minnesota , declared that the city colleges were seriously handicapped because their budgets and their disposition of appropriated sums were controlled by the Budget Director . Neither during nor after Ms broadcast did the Mayor indicate the dollar amount of the reduction in the appropriation of the Board of Higher Education . Nor did he hint at the number of teachers who would be dropped from the rolls or have to accept pay cuts . The Mayor said he approved the idea of having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! leges that constitute the College of the City of New York . Throughout his talk the Mayor indicated his continuing resent-1 ment against critics of his attitude toward the Board of Education , which operates the elementary and high schools . Referring to a tabulation comparing salaries of New York teachers with those M other communities , he conceded that it " checked , " although prepared by the National Education Association , which " will falsify figures or make misstatements to serve their purpose any time , anywhere . " , At another point in his broadcast he declared that " I think it very annoying when some two-byfour little hick teachers from outside New York try to analyze our system and give us advice . " ' The Mayor said he would try to grant to the Board of Education the amounts it has asked for such projects as child guidance , supervision of children with retarded mental development , speech improvement , teachers for homebound children and playgrounds after school hours . Despite the need for " picking up $48,000,000 " and contending with an increase of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce a balanced budget for 1944-45 . " You can say that the Mayor was n't grouchy , " he said after the broadcast , when asked if he would balance his budget . The budget was being drafted , he said , on the assumption that the war would continue through the fiscal year . " If the war ends during the year and city employes on military leave come rushing back , we 'll be all out of line , " he said . The budget , the Mayor declared , would be submitted to the Board of Estimate at 1 P. M. on Saturday . The Mayor refrained , " for strategic reasons , " from making public any exact figures for 1944-45 , except in the case of debt service , which will rise from $152,017,000 in the current budget to $167,628 , - 183 in the new one . Of this amount $56,718,000 represents transit bond obligations and is offset by only $15,600,000 of transit revenue , leaving a deficit of $41,100,000 . The Mayor served notice on the city 's firemen that they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they discontinued their present suit against longer tours of duty . The bonus would become effective as soon as the suit was dropped and the men signed the waivers required under the bonus plan , he said . The Mayor concluded his talk with a bit of philosophy on his own job . " Taken all in all , it Is a great city , " he said . " It is a mighty city . One has to absorb a great deal of abuse , but it is worth while . Some ? times you get so discouraged at the end of the day , you say , ' Oh , what is the use ? ' You want to give it up . But you look around and youtsee these playgrounds and the different parkways , you see these health centers and you see these happy , healthy children . Oh , I will tell you , it is worth while , but it does require a great deal of patience and fortitude . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
