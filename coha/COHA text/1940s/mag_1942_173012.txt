Corregidor can and will be held . There can be no question of surrendering this mighty fortress to the enemy ; it will be defended with all the resources at our command . <P> Thur Lieut . General Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright spoke last week to the men on The Rock - the artillerymen and infantry soldiers of the regular garrison , the Marines sailormen and Army men salvaged from Bataan . <P> In the States as on Corregidor and its satellites ( Forts Drum , Hughes and Frank ) , men took heart . Jonathan Wainwright was no hollow-voiced orator , to fire his people with false hopes . If he said it could be done , maybe it could . In the corridors and subterranean rooms of The Rock , the new arrivals were swiftly put to work making life tough for the Jap . <P> Meanwhile , all the forts were pounded unmercifully . Since Christmas week Corregidor had stood close to 200 air raids . Now it had Jap artillery , emplaced on the heights of Bataan across only two miles of water , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jap , and it made life on Corregidor , as a U.S. Army officer said , something like living on a bull's-eye . <P> But the Jap was on a bull's-eye , too . To The Rock 's artillerymen , the roads , hills and valleys of Bataan were as familiar as the vein pattern on the backs of their hairy hands . They had the range of every position behind Mariveles . The Jap found that out as battery after battery was smashed and silenced . When he tried to move up more guns , the sharp-eyed observers on The Rock spotted his dust , called for fire , and got it . Bereft of aerial observation , which would have made things much simpler , the men on Corregidor were doing their best , and it was still good . <P> As long as food , ammunition and medicines held out , Corregidor and its satellites might well hold off the Jap . And now that U.S. bombers had reached up from Australia to Manila , " Skinny " Wain-wright 's men could hope that light supplies , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see p. 20 ) . <P> But if that were to be done , the Jap had to be kept out of U.S. operations bases in the islands to the south , where he was striving with might &; main to get everything into the clutch of his stubby fingers . He had finally taken the city of Cebu ( which U.S. airmen promptly fired - see p. 20 ) , had landed also on Panay. * <P> With his air strength spread thin ( see p. 19 ) and his ground soldiers scattered from hell to breakfast over the southwest Pacific , the Jap 's job was a big one-and Filipino troops were making it bigger every day by raiding him from Davao to the beachheads of Panay . If they had air-force help from Australia , they might make the job too big for the Jap to handle . <P> <P> *Nameplace of the U.S. gunboat destroyed on the Yangtze by the Jap in 1937.
