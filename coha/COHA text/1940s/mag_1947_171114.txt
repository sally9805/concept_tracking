Mme. Rene Lehut is 43 , small , blonde and shapely . She lives and is politically active , to put it mildly , in the grimy suburb of La Courneuve ( voting strength : about 8,000 ) in Paris ' " Red Belt . " Ordinarily the town politics of La Courneuve are not big news . But last week Rene Lehut made the transatlantic cables by doing something that millions of women do every day . She changed her mind . <P> In October , La Courneuve had elected 27 town councillors , 14 of them Communists . One of the 14 was Rene Lehut . Last week the council met in public assembly to choose a mayor . The thing seemed to be in the bag . In a preliminary huddle , the " Cocos " ( Commies ) , holding a majority , had decided to cast a solid vote for one Maurice Lonard . <P> The 27 ballots were taken out of an urn and counted by the council 's oldest member . Something seemed to stick in his throat . " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Madame Lehut is elected . " <P> Incredibly , the shapely Rene had defied the party ; she had voted for herself . She simply thought she would be a better mayor than Monsieur Leonard . Nine Gaullists , two Socialists and two Popular Republicans had gleefully agreed . <P> Communists demanded her resignation as mayor , besieged her home , picketed the town hall . One day an agile comrade ; threw a right hook past a policeman 's shoulder to Rene 's Grecian nose , altering its shape somewhat . Her sponsors whisked her to a refuge . But she would not resign . <P> Said a woman Communist : " That woman has dirtied the clean name of Communism . Yes , she is well built-her figure is in better shape than her morality .
