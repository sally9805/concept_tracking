Gimbels ' Bargain Basement looked festive . The counters were gone , the merchandise out of sight . Between the mirrored pillars long tables were set for midnight supper : hot dogs , doughnuts , popcorn , coffee . Some 750 New Yorkers were there to bid , with war bond pledges , on such precious items as Thomas Jefferson 's Bible , a letter written by George Washington . <P> Glib , wild-haired Musicomedian Danny Kaye , working like a turkey gobbler , held up the auction 's prize piece . It was not precious . It was a curio : Comic Jack Benny 's violin , " Old Love In Bloom " -a $75 imitation Amati . Everyone present knew that only a war could have persuaded Benny to part with the old prop which had provided him with half his gags for the last 20 years . Before anyone could make a bid an attendant rushed up to Auctioneer Kaye with a letter . He opened it and gulped : " I have a bid for $1,000,000 ! " <P> That ended that . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mild-mannered , aging gentleman in the rear of the basement rose and bowed . It was the first bow Julius Klorfein had ever taken . <P> Negligent newspaper reporters assumed that anyone who could afford that kind of money for a broken-down fiddle was a known man . They were wrong . The city-room files were bare of Julius Klorfein 's name . At his penthouse apartment he apologized for this unfortunate anonymity : " I 've just spent my life working hard and building up my cigar business , and I guess I did n't have any time to get in Who 's Who or What 's What or anything like that . " <P> Julius Klorfein has been busy all his life . Now 58 , he is president of Garcia Grande Cigars , Inc. , manufacturers of some of the U.S. 's best-selling nickel and two-for-a-nickel smokes . He came to the U.S. from Russia 40-odd years ago and began turning out his own cigars in the window of a little street shop in Brooklyn . His formula for a mild , cheap cigar caught on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. , Cuba , Puerto Rico-all turning out millions of Garcia Grandes . <P> " My hobbies are work and finance , " said Julius Klorfein . " I am active in Jewish charities and once I backed a Broadway show but it was a failure . That 's about all there is to tell . " <P> But there was more . Mr. Klorfein had an afterthought : " My wife bought some bonds at the Gimbel party , too . How much was it , dearest ? " She said it was only $175,000 worth , but " of course , I 've been buying war bonds all along . " <P> The occasion of Julius Klorfein 's purchase was not unpremeditated . A perceptive young woman named Edna Skinner , actress , radio commentator , fashion model , now a member of the A.W.V.S. , heard that Mr. Klorfein had bought $500,000 worth of war bonds recently during a trip to Florida . She thought it would be fine if he could double that in Gimbels ' Bargain Basement . Julius Klorfein agreed . <P> Fondling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked whether he could play it . Said Julius Klorfein : " If I was a violinist , I would n't be able to buy a million dollars worth of war bonds . "
