txt  | and the one that departed from it for Washington and the South was through the streets of the turbulent town . When the locomotive engineer brought his train into President Street Station on the east side of the city , the cars were unhitched from it and drawn , one by one , through Pratt Street to highspired Camden Station on the west side . . . . It was crossing this way on that fateful April day in 1861 , that the Sixth Massachusetts almost came to its Waterloo ? before it ever had seen the fields of battle . The strong Southern sympathies of the chief town of the Maryland Free State had filled Pratt Street with an ugly and unfriendly mob . The Baltimore of those days always did like mob spirit anyway . Anything for a fight ? good or bad . One thing had led to another . First oaths had been exchanged ... then stones . . . and then bullets .... Then open fighting broke out in the street . Bloody fighting . Fatal fighting . Before the Sixth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muddy street and twelve of these were citizens of the town . For some time after that , the Union Army avoided Baltimore . An alternative rail route with a steamboat link from Perryville ( across the mouth of the Susquehanna from Havrede-Grace ) down the Chesapeake Bay to Annapolis , then by rail to Washington ( so , completely avoiding the troublous Baltimore ) was used , until discipline was established and conditions in the Maryland chief town could be placed in order . Three months later the Iron Horse of the South had his first taste of military strategy : A group of Confederate troops in the Valley of Virginia had slipped away under the very noses of a detachment of the Union Army set to watch them , had taken the cars of the Manassas Gap Railroad up over the Blue Ridge Mountains , and had detrained in time to join  | their brethren in the East and to become the decisive factor in the victory of the first Battle of Bull Run . Nor should Iron Horse 's part in Sherman 's march across Georgia to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final victory of the Union over the Confederacy . An invading Northern army of over 100,000 men and 37,000 animals was to be kept continuously supplied with food and munitions of war for 196 days . A single-track railroad , none too well built or equipped , extending for nearly five hundred miles from Louisville through Chattanooga to Atlanta , was to do the task . Somehow it succeeded . No wonder that Sherman wrote that his victorious campaign would have been impossible without the railroads . All in all , North and South , the Iron Horse in the United States showed his fighting heels in the Civil War and came through very handsomely . A final paragraph may well conclude this part of the great American drama of the ' sixties : It is in the ancient records of the War Department that in two brief months ( June and July , 1865 ) some 233,000 soldiers and more than 2000 tons of baggage were despatched to the North out of Washington Station . At the same time , 27,000 horses and mules were sent from the adjoining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad together had learned a great military lesson . One single chapter of it had been the haulage of 96,796 soldiers and 9896 animals the entire tenuous  | the time that the McAdoo regime was in full swing , much of the troop movement overseas was completed . However , there was to come a return movement of almost equal size . The wartime transport organization at Washington functioned until it was ended . Overseas , an entirely different rail organization , although cooperating with the home one , came into existence . Its job was to pick up the American Expeditionary Force ? in those days known as the A.E.F. ? at various French ports of disembarkation , chiefly Brest , St. Nazaire , and Bordeaux , and bring it up to the battlelines in Eastern France . By that time , the main-stems of the French railways still in existence were having all that they could do to move the French and British armies . They had reached the very limit of their resources . What came to be almost an entirely new , far-spread , national railway system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was done most ingeniously and rapidly by taking the secondary lines of the five French railways and developing them into a secondary rail system , almost independent of the first and in some ways superior to it . It all meant quite a bit of construction work under highly disagreeable wartime conditions . All materials , including enough rail to put down two thousand miles of track , had to be imported from the United States . In the same way , more than two thousand locomotives and many thousands of freight cars were also imported from America .... This added very greatly to an already congested transatlantic shipping problem . To head this swiftly-created railroad overseas , President Woodrow Wilson turned to the Pennsylvania Railroad organization , and from it chose a highly capable operating man and  | engineer , the late William Wallace Atterbury , at that time vice-president and later president of the road . Without a minute of delay , General Atterbury accepted his new post . He brought to it a fine supporting organization including George T. Slade , operating vice-president of the Northern Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Atterbury , Slade and their associates went to work immediately . War against Germany was declared April 6 , 1917 . . . on May 8 , the first detachment of the A.E.F. was upon the ocean , on its way to France ... on June 14 , a convoy of fourteen ships , carrying the flag of the United States and 11,991 officers , enlisted men , nurses and civilian aides followed . . . within six weeks , another six base hospitals , three regiments of field artillery and six regiments of railway engineers . . . and then it was that the valiant First Division came into existence overseas . The very cream of our railroad personnel was taken in great numbers for the railroad regiments that went overseas . Eventually , there were 69,000 active American railroaders marshalling the little Hommes 40 ? Chevaux 8 box-cars upon the railways of the sunny ( more or less ) France . Amongst them was represented almost every form of top-o ' - th ' - rail man ? locomotive engineers and firemen , conductors , trainmen , telegraph operators , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master mechanics ? nearly every form of railroad rank and file ? all organized into complete operating companies for every hundred miles of railway to be operated . The construction and maintenance men who had preceded them made a thorough job of it . When the American cars and locomotives arrived in France . the trackage was ready . The freight-cars , double-trucked , thirty-three feet long and equipped with air-brakes , were of a type never  | before seen in Europe . At the end of the war these cars remained in France . The air-brakes were removed ? quietly and quickly . No use to have the European railway boys get any such new-fangled notions into their heads . They still could sit in their little cabins atop each fourth car and do the braking by hand ? in the good , old-fashioned way . Of the overseas movement of men and munitions in the present war this book obviously can say little or nothing . But there is today no secrecy about the traffic between the two American railroad systems on opposite sides of the Atlantic in World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The figures , even today , are most impressive . In the troop-train movements of the railroads of the United States 13,000,000 men , in addition to their arms and accoutrements , were carried an average of 388 miles a man in the twenty-seven months of our participation in the war ... . Actually 1,777,109 men went overseas . Eighty per cent of these went through the Port of New York . . . twelve per cent through Newport News , Virginia . . . straggling numbers through Boston and Philadelphia . . . 40,000 down the St. Lawrence from Montreal . From the modest beginning in New York Harbor in May 1917 , the monthly debarkation increased steadily until July 1918 when 268,127 men sailed out past the Statue of Liberty toward far-distant shores . That was a one-month record ... . But August of that same year saw the largest one-day record , with seventeen transport vessels sailing through the Narrows bearing 51,356 men and their weapons . The impressive convoy was led by two magnificent ships ? the Leviathan and the Aquitania ? which between them carried more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Through the late summer and into the autumn the hegira continued upon its way . On the very eve of the Armistice ? Sunday , November 10 , 1918 ? the Mauretania departed , with 5403 troops . Late that evening and early the following morning , 22,500 more men were loaded into twelve ships about to sail out of New York Harbor . These never sailed . On the afternoon of the 11th , the soldiers crowded upon the decks of the transports , listened to a great city in pandemonium . After the first excitement was quite over , they went ashore for a little pandemonium of their own . Their trip was off ! They were not to see the shores of sunny France ? not that time , anyway . In the meantime , the Railroad Administration was on the job . Draft calls already had been issued and arrangements made for entraining 250,000 men in the five-day period , beginning the fateful November 11th . At 10:25 that morning the Troop Movement Section was advised by telephone from the War Department that all of these calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as the last guns were booming overseas , by rapid use of the long-distance telephone it had notified all the railroads of the country to stop further entrainments , had reversed the troop-trains already under way , and the work of restoring the men to the original points from which they started was well under way . . . . The entire tide of troop movement was about to reverse itself . From ebb it changed to flow . Rapidly this incoming tide developed real proportions . December , itself , saw 75,000 men returning to their home country . By the first of the following July 1,485,188 men and officers of the victorious A.E.F. were back on home soil . Three months later the last of the Army of the first World War was back . All , that is , except the relatively small Armv of Occupation in and around Coblenz , Germany , which was  | to remain overseas for nearly two years more . This was made up quite largely of new recruits from here . This account takes no measure of the movement both within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its numbers it is also very impressive , but , naturally , far less than that of the land forces . Much of the Navy 's land transport work was handled by the Army , working first through the American Railway Association and later through the United States Railway Administration . Of course , the Navy took care of its own upon the seas in its own most adequate craft . However , its movements were purely a matter of war strategy and operation ? all performed by its own men ? not by civilians being called to do a transport task of supreme magnitude the like of which they had never before attempted .  | ONCE again our soldier boys are riding West . . . just as their grandfathers and their great-grandfathers rode before them .. . in the emigrant treks of the ' thirties and the ' forties . . . in the gold rush of the early ' fifties . . . in the ' sixties , in response to Horace Greeley 's stentorian , " Go West , young man , go West . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build up the Union , but to preserve it , even if their West is not golden California or the rim of Pacific shore , but far-off lands across many thousands of miles of tossing ocean . Perhaps it is a West that is East ... across the almost equally wide Atlantic . This time they are not riding on horseback , or in clumsy covered-wagons , or in creaking Concord stages . . . . Today they are riding the railroad , not in dusty , yellow day coaches as rode the boys in the Civil War days , but in the lordly American way that the late George M. Pullman made possible for the elect . The American Army of 1943 is the elect . It rides the Pullmans . In World War I the Army rode the Pullmans only if the run was for more than twenty-four hours . Twenty-five years ago there were many more day coaches and a few less Pullmans . Today , even if the run is only one night in length , Pullman sleepers are the rule , a rule violated only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier of today rides in a sleeping car , three men to a section , or thirty-nine men to the twelve sections and the drawing-room of the standard car ... . Two men in the lower and one in the upper berth .... The  | Navy does just a little better by its men . It only puts one man in the lower . Perhaps that is because Secretary of the Navy , Knox , is a fatter man than Secretary of War , Stimson . You may draw your own conclusions . Sometimes a troop train will get one of those big sixteensection sleeping cars that the Pullman company originally built for short-distance overnight runs . Then the porter has a real job ahead of him : thirty-two beds to be made and remade ; forty-eight passengers to be accommodated sometimes for four nights running . At such times , the boys are apt to pitch in and help him on his man-sized job . They are not a particularly flush crowd , so the sleeping-car company makes up the loss of tips to him in a slight increase in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? in many cases better than the average run of civilians ? well behaved , as well as helpful . . . . It is only from the casuals that the Army occasionally gets complaints of drinking and the like . As a matter of precaution , it has placed Military Police upon many of the morecrowded , regular passenger trains ; a good many people still seem to think that it is smart to buy drinks for traveling soldiers . They think it a sort of patriotic gesture which , in most cases , it definitely is not . A soldier on an empty stomach is no more fit to battle against alcohol , than is a civilian . Occasionally , a troop train comprised wholly of sleeping cars ( with an inevitable kitchen-car and a baggage-car or two ) , or all of day-coaches goes out of the entrainment depot . Frequently , there is a mixture of both ; but the outstanding troop train of the United States Army of 1943 is of a different sort . It is complete and it moves a military unit , a regiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battalion of infantry , a battery  | of artillery , or a company of tanks . It has a sort of circustrain consist . . . freight and passenger cars intermingled .. . and because of this , it can not go quite as rapidly as the allpassenger ones , but with its air-brakes and its carefully picked equipment it does pretty well at that . A typical train of this sort is one which might be transporting a battery of field artillery from one point to another . Its consist probably would be a baggage-car or two , five Pullmans , a kitchen-car , two or three box-cars , then some twentyfive or thirty flat-cars on which ride four tractors , four guns , four more tractors and four caissons . At the rear , the familiar little red caboose . The passengers always are placed to the fore , so that they may be heated more readily . Experience has shown that from one locomotive it is almost impossible , in very cold weather , to properly heat more than fourteen or fifteen passenger cars . The passenger units @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For obvious reasons , the Army likes its troop organizations to travel as a unit . Some troop trains have had as many as twenty-three , or even twenty-five passenger cars in a single unit . Because of this problem of heating the rear cars , the railroads have preferred to cut such trains in two in cold weather . In one case though , a troop commander , taking his orders literally , insisted that his organization must move on a single train . The Northern Pacific , over which he was moving , solved the problem by the expedient of placing a locomotive in the middle of the train in order to heat its rear cars . But , in case of an accident , the middle of a train is not a good place for a locomotive ; and it is now understood that Army orders for moving organizations as a unit permit the train to be broken into separate sections whenever it becomes necessary .  | On December 7 , 1941 came Pearl Harbor , and hard on the heels of Pearl Harbor followed the cold months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the railroaders . In zero weather it not only is harder to keep steam up at full heat and pressure in locomotives , but the hose connections and other equipment of the cars have a tendency to freeze . A troop train pulling into Buffalo over the Lackawanna in subzero weather one January day , arrived with most of its hose connections frozen . Before the New York Central could move it on its way , it had to go out to the East Buffalo shops where five valuable hours were lost thawing out the equipment . The railroaders only regarded it as part of the day 's work . In upstate New York they are pretty used to winter railroading . If there will be more than four or five passenger cars to be served , the kitchen-cars are placed in the center of the train to facilitate service . These are onetime baggage-cars temporarily converted to cuisine service . One of them is allotted to each 200 or 300 men . It is stocked with food supplies for at least two days . The nearest railroad shop has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two ranges , and it can carry a considerable amount of food within its sixty or seventy feet at length . Fresh vegetables , milk , fruit and the like will be picked up at the first stopping point each morning of the run ; the commanding officer of the train has funds for this purpose . . . . There is a genuine effort to vary the menus for the three or four days that may be taken to cross the continent ? just as the Harvey eating-houses used to do all the way across the Southwest . The mess-steward in the kitchen car may not be a trained chef , but he , too , has been carefully picked for his job , and woe betide him if he is not proficient in it . Wherever and whenever it is possible , the boys come with their kits to get their grub . Gravies , soups , and sauces are eschewed on the  | troop train ; the Army has too much respect for the condition of the Pullmans . But the boys have all the coffee and milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army travels on its stomach , and travels very well . When a detachment is not large enough to justify a train and probably is riding in extra cars attached to a regular train , recourse is had to the dining-car , if the train boasts such a luxury . A dollar a meal is allowed each soldier and if he does not like the special meal that the dining-car steward has prepared , he may order anything that he likes on the menucard and be credited a dollar on the check .... We are pretty good to our boys in this war . They deserve it ! For some years past , key men in the War Department at Washington , sensing the coming of the present conflict , had begun to prepare for it . Not a few of them had been in World War I , had watched the movements of men and munitions toward the Atlantic seaboard . . . toward embarkation for the battlefields of France . That was a good job even if it was but a one-direction one , and it was a fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military practice , it was not done well enough . At times there were too many slips , too much confusion . Too many weird and fantastic ideas were advanced during the wartime operation of our roads such as taking whole lines and groups of lines and putting them into single-track operation ? up on one set and down on the other . All of this was a bit upsetting to the practical railroaders , who were trying to do an extraordinarily difficult job with the meagre means at their command and under most trying conditions . In the last analysis , a railroad is a far-flung army , a well- organized and long-standing army of men and locomotives and trains , all working in unison . Its men long-since were trained in discipline and in organized effort just as are the soldiers of any well-trained army . They are on an unceasing lookout for emergency or disaster : flood , holocaust , washedout bridge . Any of these things can come to pass in a day 's work . The railroaders are trained to meet them . In the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this railroad army , already trained and seasoned , quite ready to do their bidding and to work side by side with them . Six years ago the Army of the United States consisted of but 175,000 men . At that time a new army had just come into existence : youth , in the form of the unemployed men and boys of the cities of the land . These were organized into the Civilian Conservation Corps and there were some 400,000 of them all-told . Most of them lived in the thickly-populated East , but the bulk of their job was in the West . To move the C. C. C. boys out to their camps became quite largely a problem of military transport . At least the United States Army so regarded it . Thus it was that the Army rehearsed troop movements in anticipation of days to come . Prior to March 9 , 1942 , all of these jobs were placed in the hands of the Quartermaster-General . On that day , with the announcement of the new Transportation Corps of the Army , its rail transport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headed by LieutenantGeneral Brehon Somerville , reference to which already has been made . The Quartermaster , Major General Edmund B. Gregory , then became a sort of traffic manager for the Army . Working in conjunction with his office is the Military Transportation section of the Association of American Railroads . The central control , which keeps track of the scores of  | organized rail movements across the land , is in Washington . The reports of all train movement ? daily or more often ? come from the railroads into two offices there , both of which are closely allied in their work . In this way , the Army is able to keep track of the exact whereabouts and progress of the thousands of men moving from day to day ; and , in necessity , to change their plans and destinations to meet whatever emergency situation may arise . The utmost elasticity is secured . The Army 's part in this rail transport job has been delegated to a man who came from the Western New York village of Albion , by way of West Point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. R. Lasher . Before he tackled this job , he trained himself for it in various railroad offices across the land . Lasher works with Arthur H. Gass , who , in another war , I found running trains across France for General Atterbury . Gass , representing the railroad association , maintains the constant cooperation with the individual roads . He sits in an office in Washington close to that of Colonel Lasher and between them they work out the moves upon a chessboard that runs from the Atlantic to the Pacific and from the Gulf of Mexico to the Canada line . This is even more complicated than it sounds . Reasonably direct routes must he chosen and yet all of the railroads are contributing to the great national efforts wherever it is possible . It is hard to eliminate old-time hopes , and old-time jealousies . Lasher and Gass began their job in the middle of 1940 . No frills this time . No experimenting with curious , untried ideas . Just straight , old-time railroading . No hifalutin ' United States Railroad Administration this time with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet in the mud of continuing failures . Just two capable executives on the job , surrounded by a capable working staff . They went to work quietly  | and efficiently , and in just a year they had moved 1,534,981 men and their impedimenta in regular trains or upon 4226 special ones . That was but the beginning . In the following seven months another 1,519,000 men had been moved ? an average of 217,000 a month ? and 4485 special trains . The big machine was functioning . All of this takes no account of the movements of " casuals " ? groups of fifty men or less ? of whom no precise count has been kept . In the opinion of the Army experts these amounted to an additional fifty per cent , making the total movement in the first year some two-and-one-quarter million men , and in the following seven months about the same figure , or about four-and-one-half million men in the first nineteen months of our war effort . . . . This figure has increased vastly . In the calendar year 1942 , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States . In that pleasant lull before the storm of December , 1941 , a new form of transport rehearsal was proposed by the two leaders of the Office of the Civilian Defense at that moment . Mrs. Roosevelt and Mayor La Guardia between them figured out a happy holiday scheme by which practically the entire American army of more than a million men might go home for Christmas turkey , with the folks . It was a sentimental idea and a pretty one ; but it was not a wartime one .... When they first heard of it , the railroaders shrieked aloud . For about three weeks over Christmas holiday time they have their heaviest passenger traffic of the year . Schools letting out , whole families returning home ? all of it a sort of back-breaking hegira for the old Iron Horse , all available passenger equipment being pressed into service . But , good soldiers that they are , the railroaders said that  | they would do their best to handle this added burden . They studied every possible plan . They asked their own people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep off the trains during that three-week period ; then they announced that they were prepared to handle the job . They never had the opportunity . Came Pearl Harbor and the seventh day of December , 1941 . The boarding-school idea went glimmering . Some of the boys went home , but only a fraction of those for whom the giant trek had been planned . Whole trains of empty cars were sent to the camps for them , only to return ? empty . The boys were going in other directions . Lasher and Gass run their offices twenty-four hours a day , seven days a week . Little had been asked of them beyond ordinary routine until that fateful seventh of December . On the eighth of December things began to happen . In the routine of their work , the Army advises them when and where troops and munitions are to be moved . Orders go first to Lasher . He , in turn , gives them to Gass , who immediately sends detailed information to the railroads involved in the operation : the exact time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be moved , the various types of equipment needed ? all the essential data . On the eighth of December , 1941 , the American Army began to move steadily and in increasing volume . The night of the eleventh was the biggest for troop movement that the country had ever known . It was exceeded on the sixteenth when eighty-two trains moved out from various camps across the land , and on the seventeenth when eighty-eight started . These were peak days . Yet , since then , the troop movement of  | December has been exceeded . For that month it totalled 251,673 ; in January it was 423,853 . Now it is a million men a month . Volume and speed ! One division of over 20,000 men moved across the continent with all its belongings in sixty-eight trains in just ten days . That was something of a record , especially when one considers that much of the run was over single-track lines . The military trains always have priority . Everything takes to the sidings for them , even the great streamliners . The Santa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours on a run because of these trains and one day on the Southern Pacific the crack Daylight Limited between San Francisco and Los Angeles was entirely cancelled . In fact , because of congested military conditions on that line , one of the two Daylights in each direction daily now has been cancelled . How does the troop train plan actually operate ? Washington rail headquarters , on advice from the Army , has ordered one of these trains put in operation from a precise point at a precise time . The railroad upon which the movement originates is informed of the number and type of cars needed , gets hold of them and of the train crews to operate them , and moves them into the entraining depot . If there are many wheeled vehicles to be loaded on the flats , a little more time will be needed to place the ramps and roll the wagons up on the cars ? circus style again . The influence of the circus seems to have played more than a small part in the making of these trains . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German officers spent an entire summer with the Hagen- beck-Wallace show , studying its methods of loading and unloading . The army boys have become proficient in this sort of work . Manuals and special instructions have been provided for their guidance and they have been taught how to place and securely block the wheeled vehicles upon the floors of the flat cars so that they will ride securely even at the highest train speed , and not go hurtling off to one side or the other . Moving in unison this way , each train is a complete fighting unit dependent upon no other . If a foe should arise while a train was crossing the Mohave Desert ? for a theoretical instance ? the train could be unloaded at once and the men and their machines shot into instant action . Whole trains have been loaded in as little as fifty minutes each . Unloading is still more rapid . Here is the thing , in theory . Now watch it in practice : An emergency movement has been ordered . A whole battalion ? say three trainloads ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Pacific Coast where the men and their machines may embark for a long , long sea voyage . . . . Washington has informed the New York Central operating headquarters in New York of the precise makeup ? the railroaders call it , consist ? of the trains ; and New York has advised division headquarters at Watertown . The trainmaster 's office at Watertown begins to scurry around for the necessary equipment . There are " flats " in Watertown Yard , but the yardmaster finds that they have metal floors ? not wood ? and therefore they are not acceptable for the loading and blocking of road vehicles upon their decks . Get Syracuse , says the trainmaster.  | ... Syracuse has the wood-floor cars ; within thirty minutes two dozen of them are headed north to Watertown . Pullmans are not quite as easy . Pullmans are very much in demand these days . Northern New York has no reservoir for them . Sixteen Pullmans are required for this four-day movement to the West Coast . In normal times the great Mott Haven yard in upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much trouble ; certainly with help from the nearby Woodside passenger terminals of the Pennsylvania ? Long Island . But these are not normal times . It is today , then , that the operating brains in Grand Central Terminal begin to think of " relaying . " If Mott Haven is short of excess sleeping-cars , borrow ten from Albany ; Albany has a normal reserve of ten cars . But Albany can not afford to lose its reserve for more than a few hours ; so Albany calls on Syracuse . Syracuse sends its reserve cars to Albany and calls on the next " pool " to the West , Buffalo Pullman " pools " in the land ... . The system works almost to perfection . Watertown gets the sixteen sleepers that it needs almost immediately . Kitchen cars ! " My Heavens , " shrieks the trainmaster up there , " We 've only got one of them things up in this district .

Three locomotives out of Watertown roundhouse , the three  | best , Mr. Foreman . If you have a power plant standing there under steam , of which you may be in the least little bit of doubt , do n't send it out , not for a troop train . Far , far better to risk a possible engine failure on a passenger , than on a military movement . Good judgment , Mr. Roundhouse Foreman . You and your master mechanic know the best that is in the huge roundhouse .... Send them off on the lead-tracks and off onto the line . They are going into service now .

Is there enough linen and blankets in the sleepers , and , far more important , enough grub in the kitchen-cars ? O.K. says the check . . . the boys and their grim machines are aboard , the conductor raises his hand . . . the wheels turn , the troop movement is under way . Three days later you might see these same trains slowly squealing their way under binding brakes down the steep Cajon Pass toward San Bernardino and the Pacific coast . Two major railroads ? Union Pacific and Santa Fe ? sharing the double-track for the ninety-two miles between " San Berdoo " and Barstow on the desert ; and between them thinking nothing of pouring twenty to thirty trains through that funnel in twenty-four hours . Strain on the despatchers and the trainmasters ? Oh no ! One of them occasionally collapses and has to be carried out ; but another takes his place . . . and the railroad carries on !

No room for trains on the piers until the last possible minute ? the men and their impedimenta will be in the way . There would be other rather obvious difficulties , too ; so the trainmasters at the end of the run must school themselves for a rather precise delivery of the trains at their final destination . An error of sixty minutes might be a rather serious one . Return to the passenger job ? the troop train movement . Prepare now to focus this picture on a single railroad system . Two roads so far have caught the brunt of the troop movement ? the Southern Pacific and the Southern . Because of their location , more camps are served by them than by any other two roads in the land . Neither has failed in its task . Take , for instance , the far-spread Southern Railway , leading from Washington down into the Southwest : With its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wartime job with enthusiasm , with a quiet zeal to do it in the best possible way .

It faced a railroader 's obstacle of extremely bad weather in early December . Yet , within seven days following Pearl Harbor , it moved an entire division west from a southern encampment , a division of sixty-nine trains and some seventeen thousand men . In three days and three nights it completed this movement , fifty-four Pullmans , 289 coaches ( on such a rush order Pullmans could not be requisitioned to accommodate all the boys ) , fifty-two baggage cars , 124 box cars and 1024 flat cars ; 1543 all-told . Of these sixty-nine trains , the Southern , itself , handled fiftytwo and turned the rest over to its competitor , the Louisville  | and Nashville . The trains were loaded and despatched at intervals of less than an hour and went through with hardly a minute of delay on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a pipe line , a terrifically long aqueduct , through which the flow must be kept as even and as steady as is humanly possible , even against tremendously adverse conditions . Locomotives , cars , tracks , all of the physical equipment must be maintained at highest efficiency . So far the roads have done remarkable work in all of this , and there is little prospect that the high standard will not be maintained . It is not always possible , at the last moment , to assemble the right rolling-stock for emergency movement . Makeshifts occasionally must be used . Sometimes ? not often ? the boys do not ride in the Pullmans overnight ? there must be recourse to the day-coaches . But , as far as possible , the Pullman rule holds . There is not the scrambling of passenger equipment that we saw in another war . . . . Sometimes , however , it does get a little mixed . You may find an Erie day-coach squeezed in between two gay Lehigh Valleys in the Washington Station yard or a red Pennsylvania one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1941 , the New York Central sent 185 of its precious passenger coaches down into the Deep South , and it still is getting them back . It may be needing them for service before long on the Hojack or the Auburn Road , when folks begin to find their tires in need of repair , and the family cars begin to gather cobwebs in the garages , and the overburdened bus systems begin to break under a fearful overload .  | AND also pass along the munitions , Mr. America . . . and the men , Mr. America . Pass them safely across the broad seas , dear God , and , with your help , we shall try to do our end of it upon the land . Inside the broad borders of the United States of America we have no slinking , enemy watercraft to tantalize and to destroy the finest fruit of all our vine ? our young mankind . We shall trust You to handle the vile submarines upon the open seas in Your inscrutable ways . . . . Here in the homeland we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ munitions as best we can , ourselves , with all of our human imperfections . We shall trouble You as little as possible about it . Old Man River and Old Man Highway and Old Man Railroad and that young Glamour Girl , the Airway , are going to do their very best in this , America 's greatest effort of all time ... . Already transport has proved itself web and woof of our war task . They call this movement of men and munitions to the front , logistics , or something of that sort . It 's a new word . In the other war , they knew it as the Service of Supply ; but it all comes to the same thing : getting soldiers and their ammunition , sailors and their ships , guns , tanks , jeeps , trucks , medical supplies and food , and ten thousand other accessories of modern warfare to the fighting fronts in the least possible time and with the least possible waste . A mighty effort , well directed , it must at least be worthy of Your respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to make it so worthy .  | Just a moment ago we were talking of troop trains moving up and down the face of our land . That is a most important part of the war transport job , but it is by no means all of it ... . It is not alone train and boat bringing ore and coal and limestone to the steel mills , steel riding out from the rolls to shipyard and to shop , jeeps and trucks and tanks and guns and all the rest of it , bound for camp and for embarkation port .. . it is not the thousand and one items that go into the fabrication of a thousand and one other items of war necessity .. . not alone the materials that go into the buildings and other construction for the supreme effort ; it is food and fuel and clothing for a nation which , already feeling the constrictions of tight rationing , is working loyally at fever heat and must be kept well-fed and warm inwardly and outwardly . Here is Mr. Logistics , Mr. America . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your millions of agents already are rising to it ! Take the railroad on which we have just watched these hundreds of troop trains scurrying back and forth . Now consider an even larger phase of the great railroad job ? freight movement . In previous chapters we have seen how the railroad in the United States , despite a steady lessening of the number of cars and locomotives through the past quarter of a century has built up its passenger-carrying facilities to new heights of strength . Now consider , if you will , what it has done for its freightcarrying facilities , always the chief measure of its strength and virility . Remember that the capacity of the box-car in twenty-five years has been raised from forty tons to fifty ; the average train capacity from 4500 to nearly 6000 tons ; freight train speeds raised sixty per cent ; locomotive pulling-power increased 37 to 40 percent , and you begin to get something  | of the fullness of the picture , the answer why in 1942 the railroads of the United States loaded 43,000,000 freight cars , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 630,000,000,000 ton-miles , all-told . All this freight was handled with a speed and a facility rarely ever reached in its history . In September 1942 freight cars moved an average of 49.3 miles a day . Track and rail improvements have kept pace with that of the locomotives and the cars . . . . Twenty years ago only one cross-tie out of every five was chemically treated to prolong its normal life to from two to three times that of the untreated ties . The picture now is reversed . Today only one tie out of five is not treated . The modern standard steel rail , best adapted to the heavy pound of swift locomotives and their trains , is 110 to 130 pounds to the yard . ( The Pennsylvania uses 152-pound rail . ) Twenty years ago less than 132 per cent of American track was laid to this standard ; today 22 per cent is that standard or even heavier . . . . Twenty years ago there was less than onehalf mile of sidings , terminal tracks and additional main tracks for each mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decreased in this period , but today there is nearly two-thirds of a mile of side-track for each mile of main-track all the way across the country . And , as a final thrust , freight car hot-boxes on the railroads here in the United States were five times as frequent twenty years ago as they are today ; engine failures seven times as frequent . These figures* of comparison need no explanation . They tell their own story .  | If engine failures today are but one-seventh of what they were twenty or more years ago , there are at least two most definite reasons for it : the locomotives are better designed and built ; and they are better maintained . To see this picture in closer focus take , as a fairly typical example , one of the best-operated roads in the land , and one whose seven hundred miles of double-track , main line is run under intense traffic density . . . . A few passenger and packagefreight trains pass over it daily ; and a great many coal trains , bringing fine bituminous out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or , in the other direction , west to the Ohio river and to Lake Erie ports . This road is the Norfolk and Western . Long ago it attained its high reputation for efficiency , which is reflected in its fine earnings year after  | year . . . . Steadily its traffic has increased this past quarter of a century , yet its locomotive fleet all this while has decreased in number . Since 1923 the pulling power of each of its great engines has shown an average increase of thirty-seven per cent . So it came to pass that , while in 1925 , its 653 freight locomotives hauled a grand total of 27,000,000,000 ton-miles of freight , in 1940 only 347 locomotives were employed to haul 30,000,000-000 ton-miles .... Locomotive failures had dropped from 388 in 1925 to but 74 in 1940 . The original cost of these big , new locomotives on all of our railroads is considerably higher than it was eighteen or twenty years ago . But , for every thousand ton-miles of freight hauled upon the Norfolk and Western , freight locomotive maintenance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16 cents . That is one answer to the improved locomotive . Norfolk and Western is at one edge of the nation ; Southern Pacific is at the other . Southern Pacific locomotives also operate over difficult mountain terrain , ofttimes with high curvatures , steep grades and severe weather conditions . Of this , we shall see more in a moment . On Southern Pacific a typical thirteen-year period ( 1927-1940 ) shows a drop in train mileage of 25 per cent and one of 30 per cent in locomotive mileage ; but an increase of 33.5 per cent in train load and one of 44 per cent in train speed . . . . Iron Horse has , indeed , new strength and speed in his veins . Repeated instances of this railroad or that . . . or all of them together . . . working with lessened fleets of locomotives and cars would seem to connote that something should be done , and done at once , in regard to replenishing these fleets . Work- ing mechanical equipment of any sort under continuous heavy strain does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men and materials for its refurbishment . No one knows this better than the railroad operators themselves . John J. Pelley , president of the Association of American Railroads , in Chicago in October 1942 , said of this : " Each locomotive in active service is handling twenty-five per cent more gross ton-miles this month than in October 1939 , and October 1939 was not an ordinary month . That month represented the culmination of the sharp upward swing which began in the late spring of that year and resulted in new high records for railroad equipment utilization . So I am comparing peak against peak when I say that each locomotive must perform twenty-five per cent more work this month ( October 1942 ) than in the corresponding peak month three years ago . " Mr. Pelley then announced that the railroads had asked the government for authority to obtain 80,000 new freight cars , approximately 900 new locomotives and 2,100,000 tons of adequate maintenance materials for the year ending October 1 , 1943 . " If that program is fulfilled , " he added , " the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance . " He further explained that in seeking authorization to build these 900 new locomotives , the roads felt that they were asking for the least possible number consistent with the estimates of increased traffic , and went on to say : " Even if that number of locomotives is authorized , built , and placed in active service before next October , it will be necessary for each locomotive in active service to turn out seven per cent more tonmiles in October 1943 than in the current month . " He gave a similar picture in regard to the freight car situ- ation . Through co-operation by the Office of Defense Transportation , the box car situation had been relieved considerably and the roads would be able to face 1943 with only the small number of new cars needed for replacements . But the " open-top " and flat car situations were serious and , Pelley added , " the railroads may be unable to handle more ore , coal , coke and other products which take open cars , unless they can get more cars of that type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even if the railroads get 80,000 new freight cars next year , of which 76,500 should be open-tops and flats , it will be necessary for each car to do about 6.5 per cent more work next October than in the present month if the railroads are to meet increased demands . Passenger traffic is going up faster than freight traffic . In the first seven months of 1942 , for example , revenue ton-miles of freight ran 37 per cent ahead of the same months of 1941 , while passenger-miles went up 57 per cent , and are still rising . " The answer to this appeal came the following month ( November 1942 ) when the War Production Board granted the railroads materials for the construction of 386 new locomotives and 20,000 open-top freight cars for the first half of 1943 , as well as a sizable quantity of steel for necessary trackrelaying , and new parts for old locomotives and cars . For all of this railroad material there was most urgent need . There is a feeling among some of the railroad executives that the car situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urgent as the locomotives . In the late autumn of ' 42 the Washington authorities began to shut off construction of new war-industry plants , for reasons best known to themselves , although the probability was that the varied munitions of war were coming more rapidly than they could be transported across the seas . That and the fact that most of the biggest war construc- tion jobs ? training camps , depots and storage warehouses upon the one side of the effort and great , new industrial plants upon the other ? had been completed , in some cases months ahead of time , obviously would lift a heavy burden from the overloaded back of Old Man Railroad . He took that part of his job in his stride and he has handled it very well , indeed . It has been one of his major accomplishments as a soldier in this present war . Locomotives are quite a different matter . After all , it is the locomotive that takes the brunt of a railroad 's overload . The greater part of all the stress and strain always is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if no new engines whatsoever could be added to the present fleet in America , that fleet would stand up fairly well until the late summer or the autumn of 1943. * After that would come a pretty swift breakdown . You can not run a fairly intricate machine at top effort , day in and day out , without rest , any more than you can run the human machine that way ... . In addition , the railroads have had their own share of trouble in gaining the necessary competent machinists for their shops . That is no small part of their problem .  | It is not enough to say that locomotives merely must be kept running . They must be kept running under overload at extremely high speeds . For , much of the railroad job these days is highspeed emergency work . Take for instance that eighth day of December , 1941 , the awful day of awakening that followed right upon the heels of the Pearl Harbor disaster .... That very Monday a group of Navy officers came over from Washington to Baltimore to inspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of plates , channels and angles under load at Locust Point on the other side of the town . . . . There was 16,004,255 pounds of it and it all was needed at once out at the far side of the Pacific . The Navy turned to that staunch , old , railroad veteran , the Baltimore and Ohio , as it had turned many times before and has turned many times since . Could Baltimore and Ohio pick up that big load and begin to rustle it at once out to the West Coast ? Could Baltimore and Ohio do that job ? It was just as part of a day 's work to that well-organized and well-operated road . Mattered it not that special equipment , such as crawler cranes and locomotive cranes , had to be brought into Baltimore at once . Mattered it not that , despite all the special equipment already assembled in the road 's home town , it would be a 24-hour-a-day task to get those eight thousand tons of steel loaded and under way . It was started and done and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's time . One week later it was at the rim of the Pacific . It was necessary to find seventy-five cars at once , at hand and ready for the emergency movement . Not ordinary cars , cars that might possibly break down at inconvenient points along the 3000-mile haul across the continent . Car inspectors  | went over the assembled equipment with a sharply scrutinizing eye . The seventy-five best cars were taken . Even out of these , twenty-six were at once quickly shopped to place them in better condition for the run ; three of them for cracked bolster diaphragms , which would seem to indicate that the inspectors were pretty much on the job . Baltimore and Ohio generally gets more than its ordinary share of the important job of hauling the special train of the President of the United States on his rather frequent trips across the land , and to each of these it gives the acme of care and attention . Pilot engines are run out just ahead of the Presidential special and no trains , bound in either direction , are permitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... . Well , no presidential train ever had much more care and attention than that precious load of west-bound steel . It not only went through on schedule , but better than schedule . In all the three thousand miles and at forced speeds , only three cars of the seventy-five were cut out enroute for mechanical defects , and these quickly were repaired and sent on , on the following trains . . . . Jobs of this sort are almost like the routine of any well-organized railroad . Remember , that in certain ways , it always is at war . It does not really need a Pearl Harbor to stiffen it into action . So it is that road after road has been tested in this great emergency and not found wanting . Today , after nearly a year of war for the United States , not one of them has cracked or fallen ; and apparently there is no present likelihood of anyone of them deserting Old Man Railroad , bending to his mighty job . His cohorts are ready and most efficient . They move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | Here is the way that another big American railroad has met the war task set before it ; at least up to the middle of 1942 , when it was well into the mighty job : The Santa Fe is one of the key railroads of the United States . It not alone is the only system whose own rails , for most of the distance double-track , stretch all the way from the hub city of Chicago to Los Angeles and San Francisco , but which also reach to Colorado and the Gulf of Mexico . It is well used to doing big jobs in a big way . Its peacetime task never under any circumstances is a picayune one . Travelers to whom the Santa Fe is chiefly a night departure from a very dingy railroad terminal on the south side of Chicago . . . breakfast in Kansas City . . . a day or two of a succession of Spanish stations and Harvey eating-houses . . . fat farms across the flatlands of Kansas and then farms , on higher land and not so fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station platform at Albuquerque . . . mountains and still more mountains , growing more sharply defined and more beautiful all the while . . . Raton Pass and the Cajon .. . and finally the orange groves and the palm trees of the " California , here we come " . . . Chiefs and Super - Chiefs . These travelers do not often think of the road as a plain , commercial carrier of vast and quiet efficiency . . . . Yet it is all of that , and then some more . In the first six months of 1942 , Santa Fe 's ton-miles of freight rose to the tremendous figure of 12,332,196,000 in comparison with a goodly figure of 7,923,899,000 ton-miles for the first six months of 1941 , an increase of 55.6 per cent . In July , 1942 , it moved 179,823 more cars of freight , including 21,091 tank cars filled with oil , which brought the total amount for this particular commodity to 137,431 carloads for the first seven months of 1942 . In that same half year at the beginning of 1942 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent  | over the first six months of 1941 . But the freight was the thing upon which the road 's chief attention was being focused , aside perhaps from troop train movement , which always has first precedence on the railroads . Freight is not alone oil from the Southwest and from California . Santa Fe serves eighty-eight per cent of the producing fields of the entire land , which turned over to it in the first half of 1941 599,214,000 barrels of oil ( 236,296,000 barrels from Texas alone ) . It also is coal ( abundantly mined in the Southwest ) , iron , lead , copper , zinc , chrome , tungsten , borax and many other essential minerals . . . potash . . . timber , fishery and farm products , fruits and vegetables ( rushing east in long , swift trains of yellow refrigerator cars ) . . . meat , on the hoof and already processed . . . poultry .. . manufactured products of every sort and variety . The list is endless . To handle all this vast tonnage quickly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent of the cattle supply of the country is raised in Santa Fe territory . Something over 80,000 carloads of livestock are shipped annually over the main-stems and branches of this far-flung railroad . Wartime demands are raising this figure appreciably . Cattle trains must be fed and watered much the same as passenger trains are fed and watered . . . . Refrigerator cars constantly must be iced and re-iced . The problem of properly handling all these things also is endless . Here then it is , as set before the operating department of the Santa Fe . To solve it properly means not only one , but many things . First , a transport machine brought in its every detail to a high degree of perfection ? roadbed , tracks , terminals , rolling-stock . . . sufficient and competent manpower ... and , finally , co-ordination for all of these parts , coordination morning , noon and night , twenty-four hours to  | the day , seven days to the week , fifty-two weeks to the year . Unending . Unrelenting . Of all these factors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the railroad in the United States today , as in most other forms of industry , is beset and sorely disorganized by the prior manpower needs of the armed forces of the nation . Not only is the Santa Fe , like all the other roads , suffering from the constant depletion of the younger members of its staff , but it is faced with the unending and difficult problem of training newcomers just as fast as it can get hold of them . This job is not always easy . . . . All this , of course , is reflected in its mechanical department at the very hour when the largest demands in its history are being made upon it . The road 's chief shops . . . at Topeka , Kansas . . . at Cleburne , Texas . . . at Albuquerque , New Mexico . . . and at San Bernardino , California , not only operate today on a sixteen-hour basis , but constantly are struggling to obtain and retain the proper , competent force of manpower , frequently against the sharp competition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transport were not of itself a considerable wartime industry . The job is done , but only the master mechanics and the roundhouse foremen know how it is done . The same situation applies to the railroad 's moving mechanical plants ? the locomotive cabs and the trains that trail along behind them . It was only a matter of months ago that the progress of advancement from the fireman 's side of the engine cab to the engineer 's was so pesky slow that many of the younger railroaders were turning toward other fields of employment when they could get into them . On one of the smaller , but fairly busy and important roads of the East , it was said in 1933 that it had been all of fifteen years since a  | fireman had been advanced into an engineer 's post ? although every fireman on the line already had qualified to be an engineer . Under the United States Railroad Retirement Act , which came into effect four or five years ago , any railroader who had been employed on one railroad ? or another ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of age could retire on a monthly pension paid him for the rest of his life by the United States Government from a fund contributed by the roads and their employees . A good many railroaders , alarmed a bit at the possible future of the roads , took immediate advantage of this rather generous pension provision . . . . Most men at sixty-five feel that they have a great deal still coming to them out of this earthly existence . The idea of retiring in the pleasant October of life without waiting for the bleak December is alluring . Thousands of railroaders all over the country began retiring at the minimum age of sixty-five . And many hundreds of them already are returning to their old colors . . . . It is a form of war service which they can ? and gladly do ? render . A competent man of seventy in the righthand side of an engine cab is generally as good as a man of forty . His judgment and experience should count for something . . . . Many an old conductor 's cap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hung up to stay and is braving the elements once more as its wearer again paces up and down beside the waiting Night Express ? his Night Express ? about to start upon its way up the line . There is a quality of loyalty in your oldtime railroader that is not often found in other professions . We have drifted away a bit from the Santa Fe and its large part in the war effort .  | A moment ago I was speaking of the mechanical effort in our war transport , that of men and machines . In the latter it has not lagged . In addition to an already abundant fleet of steam locomotives , the Santa Fe has purchased not less than thirty-six high-powered Diesel-electric road locomotives ( with a total of 115,600 horse-power ) and some forty-eight Diesel-electric switches since 1936 . . . . Early in 1941 the first Diesel-electric freight locomotive went into service upon the system . Eleven others followed for heavy line operation between Argentine , Kansas ( just outside of Kansas City ) and Belen , New Mexico ( 540 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 600 miles ) . They now are more than justifying their operation .... The road 's daily Chief is hauled by steam ; the twice-a-week Super Chief , however , is Diesel . On this latter train , one locomotive , changing only its crews each few hundred miles , makes the run of 2227 miles between Chicago and Los Angeles . Between these runs it makes sizable side trips , in one case between Chicago and Kansas City , and in another between Los Angeles and San Diego . In this way , both equipment and investment are kept steadily at work . Some of the Santa Fe 's steam locomotives also make astounding runs such as the passenger haul between Argentine and Los Angeles via Amarillo , Texas ? 1788 miles ; and another of 1590 miles from Los Angeles to Newton , Kansas . There are several other rather excessive runs upon the road . It is not so many years ago that the New York Central took three locomotives for the 440 mile run from the Grand Central Terminal in New York to Buffalo . Nowadays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Grand Central to Harmon , one of the road 's fine Hudsons will take the 17- or 18-car train and haul it at a steady sixty miles an hour or better to Windsor , Ontario or to Toledo , Ohio ( in the  | one case , 727 miles , and in the other 686 miles ) with the greatest of ease and without any change save that of train crews . At the end of 1941 the Santa Fe owned 79,929 freight cars of all types . One year later , despite great difficulties in getting new equipment of any sort , it had increased this sizable fleet by nearly two thousand more cars , an even hundred of them designed especially for handling airplanes and airplane parts , while several hundred older cars have been rebuilt and adapted for this most important duty . A vast number of our airplane assembly and manufacturing plants are situated at the far end of the Santa Fe system . In serving this most essential industry promptly , the road is performing one of its most valuable wartime efforts . When it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the maintenance of its track ? the Santa Fe is making another valuable contribution to the war effort .... As an important part of its great job , the Army builds railroads of its own , not only here at home but overseas , whenever the necessity may arise . The newspaper men noticed locomotives among the vast array of equipment that was being landed upon the north and west coasts of Africa in the late autumn of the memorable 1942 . . . . Soon again the American locomotive may be whistling his way across the sunny fields of France and right up into Germany and Russia ; and new rail lines will be going down for him to traverse . In another chapter we shall see how very thoroughly the United States Army has organized itself for this particular effort , and see some stretches of sizable railroad that already have been put down here in the home country . . . . But railroads can not be easily constructed without rails . And rails ,  | as any operating man quickly can tell you , are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best , they come only to a most limited extent . The Santa Fe needed rail , and much of it , not only for siding extensions and brand new lines into military and airplane bases , training camps , flying fields and wartime industrial camps ( some 293 miles , or as long as a new railroad all the way from Chicago to St. Louis ) , but new rail for its regular program of track renewal ; for its track was being pounded steadily under a vast increase of war traffic . In 1942 it managed to put down 170 miles of new rail upon its main lines . In April of that year the War Production Board ordered that the railroads , whenever and wherever they replaced old rail by new , should turn over ninety per cent of the discard to the Army for its own railroad needs . The Santa Fe met that order handsomely . By October , 1942 , it had turned over more than 213 per cent of relay rail . The road proved itself a good soldier in more ways than one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is . . . . One of its non-competitive lines is the muchtraveled 130 miles of single-track along the rim of the Pacific between San Diego and Los Angeles . The recent and swift war development of the former place , thrust a heavy civilian task upon this route with its heavy grades and sharp curvatures . In addition to that there came civilian and military emergency or holiday movements of no small size . For instance , that fifth day of July , 1942 , seven sections of a single train , sections following closely upon one another 's heels , brought 4919 passengers up from San Diego to Los Angeles . On another occasion 6411 passengers were carried between those two cities between four o'clock in the afternoon and midnight . No indifferently run railroad could have tackled that job and gotten away with it . To have handled it with  | facility and despatch , is a high compliment to the men and morale of the well-staffed Santa Fe . The man who primarily was responsible for so much of this last , the late Edward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new generation of Santa Fe railroaders with pre-eminent satisfaction .  | WITH the possible exception of the little Oahu Railroad in Hawaii , no American railroad has faced such wartime problems as have confronted Southern Pacific . Unprecedented traffic , insufficient equipment , and more than average loss of experienced personnel have become the facts of life to Southern Pacific 's management . And just to make the situation tougher , the road has had to operate since the very outbreak of war under virtual combat zone conditions . The other American railroads have not been unaware of Southern Pacific 's position . Though little has been openly said , the spectre of government wartime control has never for a moment been forgotten by them . Nor has it been forgotten by the advocates of public ownership , though the superb performance of the railroads has given them little excuse to speak . But let one major road crack under the strain and the dreaded anvil chorus would begin . So , as the others watched the labors of Southern Pacific in its crucial spot , they were glad to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and munitions ? all that we can muster of each ? must be embarked from both Atlantic and Pacific ports . Cities on the Eastern seaboard are served by many railroads with double or even four track operation , involving for the most part , short hauls from production centers . Southern Pacific , on the other front is , for the most of its part , single track and stretches over wide reaches of mountain and desert country . Yet , the vast majority of the men and  | materiel for the Pacific war come West sooner or later on Southern Pacific rails . Despite the lean depression years , the road had managed by careful management and rigid economy and by borrowing large sums not only to maintain its plant , but also to improve its efficiency of operation and the character of its services . It had introduced streamliners and fast merchandise hotshots to its rails . It had laid down heavier steel and purchased more powerful locomotives , engines that could haul longer , heavier trains on faster schedules . But it had also , under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locomotives that stood rusting on its rails . The most optimistic operating officials could see no possible future usefulness for them . . . then . How welcome they would be could they be resurrected now ! When peace vanished from Europe in August 1939 , Southern Pacific began to lay plans for handling wartime traffic . Between Poland and Pearl Harbor it ordered 110 steam locomotives and 72 Diesel switchers . Rolling stock was added also ? more than ten thousand freight cars and close to a hundred passenger coaches . All of this new power and equipment represented an investment of more than $64,000,000 , preparedness for the tremendous traffic the war would create . This traffic did not materialize immediately . As late as October 1940 our defense program and shipments to the belligerents had created scarcely a ripple in Southern Pacific 's business . Then it rolled in like a flood , so rapidly that when 1940 closed , more ton-miles had been handled than in any previous year of its history . The resulting increased earnings and the more liberal credit which they justified were ploughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense appropriations ran into box  | car numbers , material shortages could be foreseen . Priorities began to stalk the land . Seventy more engines had been ordered in the spring of 1942 , but it was apparent that all new equipment on order might not come through as scheduled . To fill the gap every piece of old motive power with a few miles left in its drivers was gathered in for overhauling . The search was far reaching and it was thorough . Twentyfive engines , some more than forty years old , were repatriated from Southern Pacific of Mexico , where they had operated for twenty years . The Northwestern Pacific , a poor relation subsidiary just north of San Francisco , gave up six of its few remaining teapots . From yards , sidings and roundhouses all over the system these forgotten veterans came . Some had even been used for years as stationary boilers and reclassified as steam plants . Now they came back to the rails , for there was honorable work for any locomotive , and none were too old to serve . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red and yellow Daylights and cab-in-front Mallets were not enough . So the wartime traveller on Southern Pacific lines has been surprised of late to pass a Chicago and Northwestern engine at the head of a freight train in Nevada , or Burlington motive power among the orange groves of Southern California . Southern Pacific , on the firing line , was being helped by its companions ! The crying need for all this power can be readily understood by a glance at the traffic figures . Nineteen hundred forty-two has more than doubled the all-time peace year peak of 1929 . It is more than half again greater than 1941 and two and a third times 1939 ? only three short years ago . During the first seven months of 1942 Southern Pacific carried an average of two billion seven hundred million ton-miles a month . Passenger traffic likewise is double a year ago ; for  | most of the western ports of embarkation lie on Southern Pacific rails , and , in addition , the Far West is being transformed overnight into an industrial empire with all the attendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What of the men and women who keep Southern Pacific trains moving and fit to move ? Over eight thousand of the men have actually gone to war . Their places and ten thousand new ones have been filled with youngsters , returned pensioners and women , all most carefully trained that there will be no slightest letdown in safety or efficiency . . . . The whole railroad , like many of the Eastern lines , is enthusiastic about its womanpower , already over a thousand strong . Women are running steam hammers and drill presses , hostling and wiping locomotives , and filling other normally male jobs too numerous to detail . In Brooklyn yard near Portland , for instance , Lily Hill , mother of a 27-year-old son , says her task as blacksmith 's helper is just fun . As a small girl in Finland she learned the trade in her father 's smithy . At Eugene six pretty girls who call themselves the " goon squad " are always on the go watering trains , cleaning and stripping freight cars , shovelling cinders , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see through the cab windows now that the girls are cleaning them . We mentioned combat zone conditions . The Japs struck Pearl Harbor on December Seventh . The very next night amazed San Francisco heard its first black-out sirens and tried hastily and unsuccessfully to make itself invisible . After a jittery night , came morning and an unequivocal statement  | from the Commanding General of the Fourth Army that hostile planes had been overhead and were tracked out to sea . The mystery of what happened then or why no bombs were dropped has not yet been dispelled , but California lost no time in perfecting its blackout precautions . Southern Pacific was faced with the immediate problem of adapting its operations to blackouts in order to keep the trains moving with their wartime cargoes of troops and supplies but invisible at night to enemy bombers . One of the most pleasant sights in the American scene long has been a speeding train at night , the giant beam of the headlight laying a pavement of light ahead , the flickering red glare from the firebox , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lighted windows . That sight is seen no more on the Pacific Coast . Wartime trains in the night present a somber spectacle . Circular metal hoods were developed to shield headlights and marker lamps . Protective screens hide the firebox glow . Every window is either painted black or tightly curtained . During actual blackouts the engine storm curtains are drawn , the headlight dimmed , and even the white plume of smoke smudged out by " crowding " more fuel oil into the burners . All switch and signal lamps , all crossing wigwags , are likewise hooded . These measures had to be quickly devised and installed . The Fourth Interceptor Command sent observation planes aloft to check them , and found them good . It was another example of close cooperation between the Army and Southern Pacific through the latter 's military bureau . Established early in 1941 to handle troop movements , the  | bureau was placed on a twenty-four hour basis when war began . Operations were expanded to work not only with the Western Defense Command , but also with the Navy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Much more could be said of Southern Pacific 's war activities , of its extensive scrap and salvage drive , of how the famous old Promontory Point line in Northern Utah , where they drove the gold spike in ' 69 , was torn up to join the scrap heap , and again , how Southern Pacific has pledged its available shop facilities to the War Production Board and how ship parts have been fabricated and heavy military materiel repaired on a non-profit basis . But this is just one part of the American railroad ; and a very vital one , if you please , doing its full job in the war effort . Back to the East once again . Here is a passenger job of great magnitude playing its part in the war effort in transport . The Pennsylvania railroad has a main stem reaching from New York through Philadelphia and Baltimore to Washington ( 225 miles ) that today is the busiest railroad in the United States , probably the busiest railroad in the world . Its wartime job of connecting three of the chief cities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world capital is today of surpassing dimensions . It is fantastic in its realities . Eight or ten years ago the Pennsylvania railroad extended its electrically equipped lines from Philadelphia on to Harrisburg and on to Washington at no small expense . Some of the wiseacres criticized the road very much for this expenditure . They argued that steam locomotives could handle the job , certainly Diesel , which the Pennsy up to the present time has been in no hurry to adopt . . . . The road ignored these  | criticisms . Its far-seeing president , the late William Wallace Atterbury , went ahead with the improvement no matter what it cost . With it went the building of an elaborate , new , main passenger station on the west side of the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia , the digging of a new tunnel parallel to the existing one east of the Union Station in Baltimore , the construction of a new , double-track bridge across the mouth of the Susquehanna at Havre-de-Grace , a good deal of additional multiple main line track , and the elimination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is the minimum standard of the Maryland Division all the way from Wilmington to Washington . ) It all was figured out very carefully ; and the line , in addition to its very heavy freight business was designed to handle an average flow of thirty thousand passengers a day between Philadelphia and the nation 's capital . No small flow that . General Atterbury figured more wisely than even he was to realize . He built for a morrow that came far more quickly than anyone might have anticipated even a decade ago . In the late autumn of 1942 I rode from Washington up to New York on the road 's crack train , the historic and immensely popular Congressional Limited , which is scheduled to make the 225-mile journey in three hours and 35 minutes : 215 minutes all-told with stops . We did it that day in fourteen minutes less than that . I had the good fortune to gain a seat at the extreme rear of the first or advance section of the train , which gave me the opportunity to see with my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has been my privilege to witness . We were out of the crowded Washington Union Station at  | 4:00 P. M. , and into the almost equally crowded Pennsylvania Station in the heart of New York at just 7:21 P. M. Being an advance section we were privileged to cut out stops . We did cut out three of the busiest and most time-taking of the lot ? Wilmington , Philadelphia and North Philadelphia . On the other hand , we were slowed by other traffic just twice ? near North Philadelphia and again just outside of Newark , where there also was a time-taking stop of four minutes . If it had not been for these slow-ups , I think that we would have made the run in three hours flat , a tremendous performance for a road which until a few years ago anti under steam operation had five hours as a minimum running time between New York and Washington ( with the sole exception of the Congressional , which made the run on a four-and-a-half hour schedule ) ... . There was a speedometer close to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most of the time we ran in excess of eighty miles an hour . There were considerable stretches when that needle climbed to ninety-seven . Yet , on a track laid for almost its entire length with a 152-pound rail , and magnificently ballasted in stone every mile of the way there was little or no vibration or sway , even at the far end of the sixteen-car train . But it was not the speed of the operation that impressed me as much as did its density . My companion and I counted in that three-hour run not less than sixty-four southbound passenger trains ( in addition to six freights and also four passenger and four freight trains bound north , which we passed as if they were but standing still ) . . . . There was an average of a passenger train every three minutes , and most of them were very long trains , too : southbound Congressionals . . . gaily-colored trains bound for Florida and elsewhere in the Far South . . . the Broadway . . . the General . . . the Admiral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines to the  | South and to the West , which for the eighty-six mile stretch between New York and North Philadelphia share four tremendously busy tracks with its traffic to and through the Washington gateway ... . The mightiest passenger traffic in all the world ! No mere commuter job this 225-mile run . At the outset , we noted the theoretical passenger-carrying capacity of this busy stretch of railroad ? 30,000 passengers a day between Washington and Philadelphia ( much higher of course east of Philadelphia ) . . . . Thirty thousand passengers a day , which was doubled the day that Franklin D. Roosevelt last was inaugurated President of the United States . On that 66,000-day the Pennsylvania 's operating people prided them- selves a good deal . A really vast crowd had been hauled to the inaugural and back without accident and without serious delay .... Yet in April 1942 , that exceptional one-day , holiday business began to be exceeded day after day in almost monotonous regularity .... The daily average for that month rose to 76,000 . June beat it with 84,000 . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day ... in the month that this is being written ( December 1942 ) the daily average is a hundred thousand passengers a day and it is still rising . ( On September 5 , 1942 the division handled 137,000 passengers in one day . ) The heaviest pressure at all times is upon the Pullmans . There come days and trains , however , when even the coachseating capacity is taxed , and occasionally passengers stand for a portion of the run . But these are the exceptions . This is part of the answer to the dire threat of rationing passenger travel . The American railroad passenger has indeed responded nobly to the appeals to him to restrict his travels . If the present condition continues ? and it seems likely to continue , there will be no rationing with all its fuss and confusion . Joseph B. Eastman is not much of a man for fuss and confusion ; bureaucracy has little place in his picture of things . He will not issue orders or ultimatums unless he is absolutely forced to do so . This is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington picture . When one speaks of the Washington Union Station , one comes to another important phase of the war transport problem . Here , again , men built more wisely than had been supposed at the time . Washington Union Station , accommodating two major rail- roads to the North and four to the South , was built more than a quarter of a century ago . People used to say that it was way over size for the needs even of a national capital of the United States of America . And that was when railroad passenger traffic was at real heights . In the years of its depression , Washington Station was a rather sad sort of place , in fact almost depressing . It is not that sort of place today . Through its thirty train gates pour 125,000 passengers each day , frequently over 150,000 on busy weekend days . This is about twice the average of World War I. Fourteen thousand taxicabs an hour is a frequent record at the station , which thinks nothing of handling upon its tracks over one hundred thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been keyed up to the war effort . Where twenty-five women formerly were sufficient to handle Pullman reservations , now more than a hundred are employed for that purpose , each with her own ear phone . Ticket windows have been increased from eighteen to sixty-five ; and many of them are set aside for the special convenience of passengers buying tickets for coaches or upon government orders . . . . More than a thousand lockerboxes have been added for the temporary checking of luggage . . . . The somewhat snooty Presidential Suite , formerly reserved most exclusively for the arrival and departure of the Chief Executives or equally distinguished visitors from afar has gained new caste as a U.S.O. lounge for men of the armed forces , some sixty or seventy thousand of whom are using it each month nowadays . Washington Union Station is doing its own full part in the winning of this man 's war .  | OLD MAN RAILROAD , coat off and trousers hitched up , is doing his part ; and now Mr. Shipper must also do his part . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking , he is doing it very well indeed . The United States is into World War II well over a year now , and as yet the transport horrors of 1917 and 1918 have not been visited upon us . Nor is there any present likelihood that they will come , nor that the federal government will be forced or anxious to take over the operation of the railroads save ? for purely military reasons ? possibly certain relatively small portions of them . **26;1470;TOOLONG did not see ports congested with clogged traffic ... 1800 miles of sidings filled with nearly 200,000 freight cars that should have been upon the constant move , instead of rusting their 800,000 wheels in tragic idleness . . . . Eighteen hundred dreary miles of nothingness and worse than nothingness . That was the picture of an unhappy America in 1917 . It was a year for general dreariness and defeat only to he matched by 1942 . An even quarter of a century elapsed between the two , and seemingly in several quarters nothing was gained save experience . Not so in railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great , indeed . The Great Awakening in railroad circles ? the realization that perhaps the Old Man was not all that he was pretending to be ? came just a little over twenty years ago .  | The railroad had barely come out of the dark cloud of government control and operation . Its equipment had been turned back to private hands in woefully bad condition . The morale of an organization that had been many years in its upbuilding was fearfully shot to pieces in a brief thirty-three months time . Wages of railroad employees had been most generously raised ; and a raise was also made in passenger fares , but there was no corresponding raise in the railroad 's chief source of income , the freight tariffs . The roads were skating along as best they could with a minimum of equipment and much of that fairly obsolete and in bad order . At that time the central organization of the railroads was the American Railway Association , predecessor of the present Association of American Railroads . It was headed by R. H. Aishton , an especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming of World War I , was president of the Chicago and North Western Railway , a line to which he had given nearly a lifetime of service . When that first World War broke , Mr. Aishton was drafted by the government and worked loyally and ably in its service . His peacetime reward was not to be invited to return to the road which he had loved so much and to which he had given so many years of faithful service . Those things do happen sometimes in private business , too . There was great resentment among Aishton 's fellow executives at the cavalier treatment that had thus been accorded him . They placed him at the head of the then-new central organization of the roads at the same salary that he had been paid as president of the North Western ? and with much more power of accomplishment . He began , not many months later , one of the great achievements in the entire history of American railroading .... Realizing the woeful condition into which the railroads of the land had fallen ? with new and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a comprehensive plan for their rehabilitation and then went out ? railroad president to railroad president ? to sell his idea . He had only to whisper of the bogey of government ownership , after the disastrous season of government control , to gain an instant and sympathetic ear everywhere . He sold his idea of complete rehabilitation to practically every blessed one of them . In April 1923 , the Association , which embraced every Class A road in the land ( earning a gross of over a million dollars a year ) , adopted a resolution at a meeting in its Washington headquarters ? immediately afterwards approved by a meeting of the coordinated Association of Railway Executives ? for a concerted policy and intensive working program to meet the growing transport needs of the country . . . . Despite cumulative ill effects of coal miners ' and shopmen 's strikes , the roads in the thirty-seven weeks from July 1 , 1922 , to March 17 , 1923 , had handled the greatest volume of traffic up to that time transported in any thirty-seven weeks in the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great blowing of trumpets , the Transportation Act which was to bring a new blessedness to Old Man Railroad and apparently to insure his earning at least 5% per cent income on his investment for most of the rest of the time , if not all of it , had been passed in Washington and had become part of the law of the land ; and it accomplished very little . But the railroads accepted it in good faith if , at times , without much enthusiasm . With it as a back-drop , they began , toward the end of 1921 , to raise and spend real money upon their properties . Beginning January 1 , 1922 , and up to April 1 , 1923 , the roads had authorized for cars , locomotives , trackage and other facilities the sizeable sum of $1,540,000,000  | of which some $440,000,000 actually was expended during the twelve months of 1922 . In those days the Washington government had not begun to assume the role of Santa Claus . There were then no Jesse Joneses to open the public purse to private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain , hard-headed bankers , who were apt to ask embarrassing and pertinent questions , as to the chief source of income for major expenditures . But the private bankers , like the railroaders , were accepting that Transportation Act in full good faith as a measure of reasonable protection to investment in railroad property , and they were beginning to dole out real money . From January 1 , 1922 , to March 15 , 1923 , the railroads purchased 223,616 new freight cars of increased carrying capacity and most modern construction . Of these something over 100,000 were finished and put into service in 1922 ... 1923 saw 197,875 new cars , also some 4000 new and efficient locomotives . . . . This pace was reduced in 1924 ; for the new equipment already added to the national railroad fleet was doing its part very well . Nineteen twenty-f our , however , saw 156,414 new freight cars and 2246 brand-new locomotives added to the fleet . Thereafter , there was a steady falling off in new equipment until 1929 , when over a million loaded cars would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadily was handling more and more and still more traffic . And Old Man Railroad was not only adding to the tools of his trade , but getting vastly better tools out of all of it . A better knowledge of metallurgy has contributed no end to this . Metallurgy means a better knowledge of the steel rail and a constant changing in its character and design . . . and metallurgy has done wonders for the stock that rides upon the rail . . . . Formerly , we thought aluminum was chiefly  | suited for kitchen utensils , stainless steel valuable only for a variety of gadgets . Today , aluminum finds large transport use , not only in aviation , but upon the rail . With stainless steel it brings new strength , lighter weight and greater economy to both locomotive and car . Light-weight rods and valve-motions , reciprocating parts and roller bearings on a locomotive represent a really vast advance in locomotive construction . . . . The strong and powerful new disc-wheels , replacing the time-honored construction of hub and spokes and inner tubes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructed and more powerful locomotive ? if not a lighter one ? gives less pound upon the track , hence better riding and pulling qualities . In the same way , freight cars have been vastly improved not only in carrying capacity , but in construction . Obviously , the strain on a car of this sort is upon the lower frame , the draft gears , the trucks and the couplings . Trucks made of solid steel castings are far stronger than the best assembled ones . . . couplings of 50 square-inches ? outside measurement ? against the oldtime ones of 25 square-inches in cross section represent a great help in the problem of distributing the terrific pull of a hundred-car train running at seventy miles an hour . Today , there is far less complaint about coupling-bars dropping and derailing cars and whole trains .. . the entire railroad machine is a far , far better one . The program adopted by the American Railway Association and endorsed by its fellow Association of Railway Executives , April 5 , 1923 , today sounds quaintly interesting . The roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by October 1 , 1923 , when the peak movement ordinarily begins , cars awaiting repairs be reduced to the normal  | basis of five percent of the total equipment of the country . " That by October 1 , 1923 , locomotives awaiting heavy repairs be reduced to a normal basis of fifteen per cent . . . . That the use of power and equipment for railroad construction and maintenance purposes be restricted to the minimum after September 1st in order that a maximum of power and equipment may be available for commercial purposes . " That the railroads in producing and consuming sections impress upon all interested the necessity for the movement of coal and ore via the Lakes in the greatest possible quantity early in the season . That railroads serving upper Lake ports carry on a campaign for early purchase and shipment of coal from the upper Lake docks to points of consumption . " That all interested be impressed with the necessity for loading all cars to maximum capacity in an effort to bring the average loading to thirty tons per car for the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where necessary and providing adequate siding capacity to facilitate loading and unloading , thereby increasing the available number of cars . " That every possible means be adopted to increase the mileage per car per day to an average of thirty for the entire country ( today it is about fifty miles a day ) , particular attention being given to prompt movement through terminals and yards and to the issuance of embargoes when necessary to prevent con-gestion We already have said that the American railroad always is at war or well prepared for it . It is in constant alert ? or should be . Actions like the above tend to prove this statement . All of the foregoing has a direct bearing upon the present situation and the tremendous war job that the roads are doing . If Mr. R. H. Aishton there in the spring of 1923 had not made many trips to the offices of railroad president upon railroad president ... Washington . . . Baltimore ... Philadelphia .. .  | New York ... Chicago ... St. Paul . . . and dug out millions of dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Railroad would not be doing quite as well these piping days as 1942 slips into the new-born 1943 . . . . The indebtedness of not merely the American railroads but of the nation as a whole to R. H. Aishton can not easily be expressed . In the present emergency his vision and his wisdom have paid large dividends to his native land . **26;1498;TOOLONG unlike 1917 saw no miles of freight cars held in idleness , clogging the railroad pipe at all the export terminals . **26;1526;TOOLONG saw the same desperate ocean shipping conditions at New York and all the other North Atlantic ports , conditions due to a submarine menace far more portentous than that of 1917 . But 1942 saw no congested railroad yards at the North Atlantic ports .... True it was , that you could ride six hundred miles to the west of Boston or New York or Baltimore or Norfolk and see export freight piled high beside the railroad tracks in almost endless monotony . . . . So far this has been the one real breakdown of our transport , and a most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in nowise responsible for it . The blame for this sad condition of affairs ? nullifying so much of our production ? lies in the Wilhelmstrasse in Berlin . The deadly accuracy and efficiency of the submarine is showing itself . More than five hundred ships sunk means packingcases , jeeps , trucks piled beside the tracks . . . . Freight growing stale and old , while silently awaiting shipping bottoms to take it to our armed forces overseas . But it was not freight waiting in cars ? flat cars , opentops , box cars , any kind of railroad car . A new order of things was in  | effect . Cars with export freight moved to the nearest available railroad reservoir to the salt-water port for which it was destined . Arrived there , they were at once unloaded as expeditiously as possible and sent back empty to the hinterland for more freight . The loads that they brought in were piled up in orderly fashion , and a guard placed over them . Later , a system of warehousing stations was developed at distances a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here export freight could be stored under roof as it awaited shipment . One of these stations alone has more than 160 acres of roof . . . . All of this is orderly and well organized ; transport efficiency proceeds in a highly efficient way , a way that already has proved its great necessity . The present war in Europe broke out on the first day of September , 1939 . At that time there were but two Army ports of embarkation : one on the Atlantic coast , the other on the Pacific . An additional full-sized port and two sub-ports were added a few months before Pearl Harbor . Since that eventful day , twelve more have been set up ? in the United States , in Canada and in Alaska . The Army port of embarkation is one of the most complex and spectacular , and one of the most colorful of all its installations . Here is a focal point of overseas transport effort . Here , both men and materials are concentrated for the last move to the fighting fronts . Here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processing , their equipment a final servicing , their personnel brought to full strength , their supply shortages made up and brought to an ample normal . Here it is that cargo and passenger are brought together , loaded  | to capacity from deepest hold to open deck , and finally fitted into their places in the great , outbound convoys . The chief task and responsibility of the ranking Army officer , who is in command of one of these ports of embarkation , is that of operating the transports assigned to him . His task extends well out to sea ? across it , in fact . If all the ships are not ready to sail as scheduled , fit and ready for Old Ocean , each blessed one of them in good repair , properly crewed , stored , stowed and armed , every other activity of the port may be set at naught .... If a transport limps home after surviving an encounter with a submarine , or if , before sailing , a vessel is subjected to a major operation to double or treble her troop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract for the work and who then supervises its execution . ... The great liner , Superba , comes in from a langorous life of taking rich widows and lovesick spinsters on a tour of the West Indies or around South America , and promptly is commandeered by the Army , which shows little reluctance in this sort of thing . Her rococco fittings and her highly modernistic little gew-gaws are thrown out , pictures and curtains taken down without much ceremony or sentiment , rugs torn up and placed in storage , twin-bed , de luxe staterooms built for two , refitted to handle as many as fifteen or eighteen men in threetiered bunks . Those patrons of yesteryear who knew the Superba as the " sweetest ship on the whole Atlantic " hardly would recognize her now in her dull , grey paint , a swift , efficient carrier for as many as ten thousand men and their arms , instead of one tenth of that number on idle pleasure bound . Each of these great ports of embarkation has its own marine repair shop . Some of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is neat and well-planned work , not only vastly increasing the passenger capacity of a ship , but laying out her hold and deck space so that she can receive the maximum amount of cargo , which varies all the way from closely-packed surgical instruments to heavy tanks and airplanes . Dovetailing these so as to neatly balance and divide space and weight , is part of the Army transport superintendent 's job . Like that of a railroad yardmaster , it is a " round the clock " job , twenty-four hours out of twenty-four . He hires and directs the temperamental , hardworking longshoremen ; and , if he can , and he generally does , keeps them out of their traditional labor disputes and stoppages . Rarely , save in the case of extremely small movements overseas , do the troops sail without being held ? " banked " like the five-day supply of freight cars , back of each port ? at a convenient staging area or camp , convenient to the port of embarkation . There they finally are made fit for the Great Adventure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship .... Each man is brought to his fullest state of perfection as a fighting entity . When the sum total of these fighting units leaves the staging area , it is ready for action at an hour 's notice . Having seen the fighting entity brought to fighting strength , it is the task of the port to see that it will reach its destination in the same good condition . This involves what is known as unit loading , of which there are variations . If the unit is expected to land on hostile shores and plunge immediately into action , combat loading is necessary ; this means that a particular unit is loaded on a particular ship and its essential supplies and equipment are stowed in such manner on that same ship that they may be unloaded swiftly and in the order in which they will be needed . Combat loading obviously is wasteful of ship space . . . . Organization loading , on the other hand , involves the embarkation of a unit and its impedimenta  | on the same vessel , but without so great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implies merely the shipment of specific units and their impedimenta in vessels sailing in the same convoy . In any case , great precision and no little thought is involved . Once the troops are over the horizon , off for their unnamed destination , a steady flow of maintenance supplies must be kept moving to them . For this there must be reserves of supplies , both at the ports and at the warehouses that lie behind them . The problem is an unending one of terrific importance . The fact that an overseas movement will run all the way from 1400 to 7500 miles , at this time , emphasizes its importance . In the early stages of any war , traffic through the ports of embarkation is practically one way ? outbound , ships and their cargoes bound overseas upon a mission of battle and of conquest . In time , an inbound traffic will develop . The sick and wounded begin to return upon the transports and the port has to debark them and move them as quickly and as easily as possible to hospital trains or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison camps . This is indeed the grim side of transport for war . . . . It becomes far more pleasant when incoming ships are bringing our own boys , well and happy , back home again . Salvaged war equipment and materials are brought back to the embarkation point for repair or remanufacture . No small amount of scrap iron may come from the overseas battlefields . Now and then an incoming transport may bring an import cargo of materials sorely needed within the United States .... When war finally is over , the port of embarkation becomes , almost automati- cally , a port of debarkation . Now it is that the tide no longer is ebb ; it is flow tide and most tremendously welcome . Now it is that bands may play and flags may wave . Anxiety is over once again . After the attacks of the Japanese upon Pearl Harbor , swiftly followed by those upon the Philippines , a great , new task was thrust upon the sturdy Service of Supplies from a fairly unanticipated direction . The feeling at Washington had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England and toward Europe . In one brief December Sunday that viewpoint was radically changed . Not that there could be one iota of neglect of the tense situation upon the North Atlantic ; it was merely that the one upon the Pacific instantly had assumed even graver , more menacing proportions . . . . For the moment , everything moved toward the West , toward trans-Pacific and Alaskan bases . The volume of traffic thus suddenly thrust upon the West Coast Army embarkation ports was far more than they were prepared to handle . The emergency situation required not only the control of rail and truck shipments at the source , but also a steady control of traffic after it had started rolling westward , so as to prevent it moving into port areas before they were ready to receive and to handle it speedily .... The same eternal problem of super-congestion at the docks . To meet this emergency , five army regulating stations were established along the main lines of the western railroads before December , 1941 , had gone to its terrible end . A sixth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and utilized to handle that of the rail traffic only , these valves later were authorized to handle that of the highways as well . Their pur- pose , accomplished from the outset , was to hold , release and divert loaded cars and trucks , in accordance with the request of the Army officers in the western areas . Sometimes whole 5000-tore freight trains were so diverted . At other times , perhaps as little as a single motor truck or a single box car . So functions the Transportation Corps of the Service of Supplies of the United States Army . A long title and an unending job . Sometimes you put it in that single new word ? logistics ; but it all comes to the same end in the long run . An army fighting in Africa . . . another in the Solomon Islands .. . others at other critical battle points . . . . At the beginning of 1943 there were some sixty-one battlefronts all told . Still other of our armies were waiting in reserve in England , in Iceland , in Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But every man-jack of them ( and every cunning and efficient little woman in the uniform of her Uncle Samuel ) fighting and living upon his stomach , a stomach that demands refueling at least three times a day . A million men , three million meals a day . Three million meals translated into food means trainloads of meat and flour and butter and eggs and milk and coffee , and all that with them goes . There is no " living upon the land " that is occupied in this war . They are not fat lands to be conquered , but rather desolated lands to be saved from the conqueror . In almost every case long since they have become barren and exhausted . They can not even feed their own .

And that is but another great task thrust upon the broad , broad shoulders of the Service of Supplies and its subsidiary , the Transportation Corps , a task not alone for war but for peace .  | While Railroads Laugh at Overloads THE present war in Europe broke out on the first day of September , 1939 . How that sinister date keeps popping up in this chronicle ! It is almost as depressing a reminder for us as Pearl Harbor , itself . . . . In no small sense , the war began for us upon that earlier day . Three weeks thereafter , the heads of the principal American railroads were meeting in Washington in anticipation of the conflagration spreading toward this country . They were engaged in making rough preparations as to what our railroads might do to meet an eventuality , which was hardly less than inevitable . What sort of wartime organization would the roads need , what wartime additions to existing personnel and equipment ? Most of the roads at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undoubtedly , the exigencies and the strategy of military and war transport situations would press far harder upon some of them , than upon others . . . . This situation actually did come to pass very much as it had been anticipated . The railroads of the South , the Southwest and the Far West , most of these territories at best rather thinly railroaded , have caught the brunt of the present effort in the transport for war . Their older brethren to the North and East more than once have come nobly to their rescue through the loans of locomotives , cars and other equipment . The problem has had constantly recurring perplexities , but apparently none were too great to be met.  | Back there in September , 1939 ? how long ago that all seems ? there was doubt whether the railroads could do the huge job ahead . Perhaps , after all , Uncle Sam would have to take them over . Perish the thought ! It is a matter of record that in October , 1939 ? they handled forty-two per cent more business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it without congestion or delay , and with a surplus at all times both of cars and motive power . On May 10 , 1942 Hitler invaded the Low Countries . Six days later President Roosevelt asked Congress for a little more than a billion dollars for national defense . The railroads across the land began scratching their heads and twisting their minds as to their own ways and means . In the summer of 1940 it was apparent that the existing supply of freight cars would be ample to meet the peak load needs of that autumn . They were more than sufficient , it seemed , for the steadily increasing need , sufficient for the moment at any rate . . . . Already , America was beginning to produce for the warring nations overseas . But , looking ahead to 1941 , the Association of American Railroads in July 1940 recommended to its member roads the procurement of 100,000 freight cars for service beginning the following year . That program was carried out . Fortunately , the black hour of priorities had not as yet descended upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extending right up to the time of present writing ( December 1942 ) , Old Man  | Railroad has been delivering upwards of five thousand carloads of defense material a day to nearly two hundred defense camps , plants and projects of every sort . It is a matter of pleasant record that not a single government project has lost one day because of the failure of rail transport , a record for which credit is due not alone to the roads , but also to the government agencies and to the contractors who unloaded and released freight cars within an average time of only one and three-quarter days . . . . Already the shipper was doing his part . Now consider ourselves back again in the fall of 1939 , the year in which the New York World 's Fair was closing its first summer of peace and sweet serenity , while almost all the rest of the so-called civilized world was ablaze with war , warfare upon a scale never before even dreamed . In the autumn of 1939 exports through the Atlantic and the Gulf ports began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York it already approached the peak load of 1918 ; but in the words of one newspaper observer , it was " being handled with such smoothness and despatch that it does n't even make news . " Railroads , shippers , steamship men , port authorities were all of them working in the closest cooperation . Twice a week the Port Control Section of the Association of American Railroads received reports of car-movements , of car-loadings and unloadings , of ship movements as well . Its particular task was to watch all these barometers and ? above all things ? to head off congestion before it had a chance to show its ugly head . Here , an ounce of prevention was worth many tons of cure .  | How well this job was done is shown in the fact that by mid-June 1940 the total freight cars on hand at all ports ? Atlantic and Pacific ? awaiting loading into ships , amounted to only five days of ship loadings ? a number which constituted no more than the desirable " bank " of freight held in cars for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This sort of " bank " deposit is considered highly necessary to the efficient operation of any major port . One year and a half later came the debacle of Pearl Harbor , the swiftly advancing menace of the submarine upon the Atlantic , and the consequent unpleasant picture of shipping at the North Atlantic and Gulf ports dropping to a minimum . Export freight began piling up in the fields for hundreds of miles back of New York and other major ports . The Army , the Navy , the railroads and the merchant marine all worked together and against vast handicaps , but all in good order , to reduce this newest of bottlenecks . Precisely how this was done is one of those military secrets to be told only after the cessation of hostilities . That it has  | been done , no longer is a matter of mere conjecture . Obviously , no armada of 850 ships and no army of a million and a half men could have been sent so successfully overseas , if there had been breakdown and failure at North Atlantic ports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pacific rim of the nation . But the method and the detail of all this must , for the present , remain secret . Here we are , a clean slate of rail transport all handled in a clean and orderly manner . . . . No mile after mile of cars loaded and impotent with freight that is awaiting a highly uncertain ship movement out from the nearest port .... There are little or none of the complicated shipping priority complications that nearly drove shippers crazy in World War I. Just an orderly anticipation of almost any situation or emergency that possibly might arise ? and a plan for its solution set down well in advance . Embargoes and permits are by no means entirely out of the present picture ; they merely are being controlled and held to a minimum . Under the operation of the embargo and permit system through the Association of American Railroads there is control by a definite plan to prevent the possibility of any congestion of traffic . This is done in the interest of the shippers as well as of the railroads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coordinated through the joint Army and Navy Munitions Board , provide  | that government freight must not be loaded upon cars until it is known definitely that the cars can be unloaded promptly after their arrival at their destination . The government can , if necessary , supplement the instructions of the Association of American Railroads by arranging through the Association for issuance of embargoes and by permitting cars to be loaded only when they can be unloaded promptly at destination . At one stroke this obviates the chief difficulty experienced in 1917 and 1918 when cars were loaded without any provision whatsoever being made for their prompt unloading at their destination , even if it does pile up unloaded freight for many miles inland . A great many of the difficulties in transportation in time of war , says M. J. Gormley , Executive Assistant to the President of the Association of American Railroads , can be traced to the fact that the war demands are greatly magnified by all interested , not realizing that the railroads are always , as a practical matter , on a war basis or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of increased traffic . This has been demonstrated many times since World War I .... Considerable difficulty in transportation in time of war can be traced to attempts to change normal shipping operations , that is , by taking the handling of routing away from the industries , themselves . Traffic managers of industries are thoroughly familiar with tariffs , routing and conditions of the route , equipment supply . . . . everything of that sort . That is part of their training and of their job . " No matter from what industry the government may be buying , it will find that that industry has a very competent traffic organization , " continues Mr. Gormley , " and without doubt it will greatly facilitate the handling of traffic if full use is made of such traffic managers and their organizations . Cars for shipments from any industry should not be ordered by the buyer ? the government ? but  | should be ordered in the same way that ordinary commercial traffic is handled , that is by the traffic manager of the industry , ordering the equipment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duplicate orders for equipment ... . In any event , we believe that this question is well worth studying by those having to do with the transport of war materials in time of war . " Gormley knows whereof he speaks . He is a fairly hardboiled , thoroughly well-trained , top-of-the-rail , operating executive , who served his hard years of apprenticeship by steadily rising through the ranks of one of the outstanding roads of the land , The Chicago and North Western . He wound up finally as Executive Assistant to President Aishton of that road . There is hardly a phase of railroad operation that Mike Gormley does not know and know well . He is the man who is largely responsible for the organization , nearly twenty years ago , of the Shippers ' Advisory Boards all the way across the country , which more than once have saved difficult , peacetime situations arising between the roads and the shippers by discussion and arbitration , mutual understanding and cooperation . Continues Mr. Gormley , still referring to war-time methods of shipping cooperation : " It can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not provide for proper control and that the aim of the industry would be the same as it was in the last war ? to get the material on cars and ship regardless of the ability of the government to receive and unload promptly , thereby using the cars for storage purposes and causing congestions . Under the plans already mentioned of the Army and the Navy Munitions Board , they specify that cars must not be loaded until it is known that they can be unloaded at destination . It is assumed under such arrangement that when an order is placed for materials , the  | order will specify either a definite date before which it can not be shipped or a definite requirement that it will not be shipped until further notice is received from the officers in charge at points of export , depots , training cantonments , etc. , that the material can be disposed of promptly on arrival . It might again be said that such an arrangement as this does not provide for the iron-clad control that should be provided to avoid the possibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide effective control should be adopted at the outset .... " ? Quoted verbatim from an address on Railway Capacity and Traffic Control delivered before the War College at Washington , November 1939 . . Mr. Gormley then goes on to set down formulae for these very things .... This is Mr. Gormley in theory , and it is good theory . But Mr. Gormley in practise is even more interesting . Mr. Gormley in practise is your typical , hard-headed , railroad division superintendent , constantly confronting difficult railroad situations in fresh guise and not letting himself for once get feazed by them . Not even in the thickest of war times ... . Mr. Gormley in practise sits calmly at his desk at Washington , levels his finger at you and tells you that in this man 's war there will be no shortage of rail transport . He means precisely what he says . He would tell you that with all the upbuilding of the great Army and Navy war machines , to say nothing of the construction of three billion dollars ' worth of new industrial plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each , there has not been and will not be any halting in rail transport . Put that down , if you will , for private enterprise and private management . Take that new ordnance plant out in the small , northern Ohio town of Ravenna for instance :  | Originally started as a $12,000,000 job , it swiftly became a $57,000,000 gargantua . Its details are not particularly germane to this narrative . And yet a contractor 's report of it tells rather graphically of a typical , American achievement , which , in turn , gives a rather pretty slant on what was just one job in the big average day of Old Man Railroad . The 24,000 acre project , situated between the busy , double-track , main lines of Erie and Baltimore &; Ohio began on a Sunday afternoon late in August 1940 , when a group of Western Reserve farmers were asked to give up , within thirty days , lands to which they and their forbears had held title ever since the days of the Connecticut Land Grants , at the very beginning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neat , white , frame houses with their New Englandish air , the homes in which they were born , and go into new places , new settings , a new life . The contractor 's report ( Building the Ravenna Ordnance Plant , published by the Hunkey-Conkey Construction Company ) tells the essence of the picture in its preface . It says , in part : .... A fast moving panorama would have to include a Sunday in late August 1940 , talking to the farmers who overnight were given thirty days to vacate farms . . . . Surveyors taking over the schoolhouse in Windham and setting up temporary plotting rooms , field engineers waiting for the day of legal right of entry to go into the 24,000 acres to take topography ; the contractor 's office set up in a farmhouse with one outgoing country telephone line so jammed with incoming calls that no service to the outside was possible , hundreds of salesmen packed around the farmyard trying to see someone who wanted to place orders for something which might be used later .. . plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dam in northern California being rushed by air mail to be used at Ravenna to save time ; wells being sunk for water  | supply ; buyers going to New York to purchase equipment from the World 's Fair for the dining-rooms and kitchens from concessions closing up ; lumber being rushed by car from every available source , trucks hauling lumber from Akron , Youngstown , Cleveland and finally Pittsburgh as available stocks became depleted ; rails being torn up in Maryland and shipped post haste to Ravenna as new material could not be waited for ; thirty miles of existing secondary roads being resurfaced in twenty-six days to beat the oncoming winter ; rebuilding farmhouses to take care of the women stenographers and telephone operators ; rush orders for tractors , scrapers , roadbuilding equipment , cranes , shovels , trucks ; the first inkling that rock existed in the cuts for the railroads and load lines , rush orders for air-compressors and drills , then more shovels and more of everything , then quicksand , and the rush for piledriving equipment to support railroad tracks and storage buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads kneedeep in mud ; the decision to enter the bogged areas with narrow-gauge railroad , the rush for dinky locomotives from the completed Pennsylvania Turnpike tunnels . . . the first snow and cold weather , the hundreds of oil-stoves and thousands of tarpaulins , the twenty-four hours every day in snow , rain and freezing weather , with never an hour lost all winter ; not one yard of concrete frozen ; the roads impassable , rock from the railroad and load line excavations piled into the muddy road bottoms , thousands of tons of slag by truck from Youngstown ; the gradual rise out of the bog with new roads daily coming into being . . . the hunt for locomotives to haul our incoming materials ; the camp completed , the dormitories filled to capacity and new ones started ; the problem of transporting men from the camp area to the ever-widening scope of new construction ; the broadcasting system for despatching and governing the movements of 16,000 men ; the first special trains from Akron and Youngstown . . . the organization of constantly increasing gangs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign painters ' band , the orchestra , the  | Ravenna Ordnance Plant players with their own little theater in the Bolton horse-barn ... the trade dinners in the commissary ; the brick layers and the iron workers on each other 's tails and the rivalry between all trades and the pride of the worker in his own profession ; the complete abolition of labor troubles from the daily program of effort to get the plant built ; the clambake , the kidnapping of the bartender , the pool games and bar in the recreation room ; the lay-off period and diminishing of forces finally arriving , the exodus of men to who knows where . . . finally the transfer of Colonel Chavin and the other ranking officers , giving due notice that the end was not far off and that one of the greatest organizations of men in the history of construction was about to be dissipated and scattered to other fields .... " So , in brief , the saga of a mighty project , one which was being repeated in greater or lesser degree at a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Old Man Railroad 's chief concern with all of it was in the heavy haulage , not only of tens of thousands of cars of building materials , but special trains bringing thousands of workers each day out from Akron and Youngstown to the plant . . . his chief satisfaction with all of it , not alone his punctual habit of delivery , but the real cooperation of the contractor and the Army which worked to prevent holdup and delay of his precious cars ; the entire job finished and completed with less than $1200 demurrage charge from 26,000 cars received , and these delays were all due to extremely bad weather conditions . Demurrage . That is the thing . Come with me now from Mr. Gormley 's office to that of Mr. Joseph B. Eastman . Mr. Eastman has the same hatred of demurrage ( the penalty paid by the shipper for each day 's  | delay to a car ) as has Mr. Gormley , perhaps an even greater one . He knows that an idle freight car not only is a losing investment but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . It is Eastman 's job , on an even larger scale , to see that traffic keeps moving , day and night , and night and day ? endless , ceaseless , untiring . He is now Director of the Office of Defense Transportation , being on leave from the Interstate Commerce Commission . He has high powers indeed . His edicts are law , subject to little review or change by other constituted authority . But Joseph B. Eastman is the quiet sort of fellow who will not invoke edicts unless they become absolutely necessary . He prefers to work through appeal to common sense and through educational methods , which is about all that is necessary for the average shipper . The others can be handled by various means . Shippers and receivers , by a close check on the details of their business , almost invariably can eliminate the necessity for the railroads making the embargoes which , not infrequently do injustice to innocent parties caught within their net . If materials are not ordered beyond the capacity for prompt unloading , the thing will almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for anchors to arrive at a shipyard before the ship 's keel is laid ; there is no necessity for having the piling arrive for the building of the yard itself before its plans are completed . The historic situation at the Hog Island shipyard just below Philadelphia in 1917 when five thousand carloads of building materials pulled in weeks before they were needed , is not being repeated in the present war . The demurrage records present the answer to this . If a manufacturer , for instance , does not use up all of his demurrage on any given car , he is given credit by the hour for any that is unused . In Rochester one big manufacturer already  | has a hundred car days of this sort to his credit , which means that he could tie up one freight car one hundred days without cost to himself . This is , however , the very thing that he will not do . This is one of the ways that the manufacturer is helping win the war , and a most effective one at that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Transportation . The maximum carrying capacity of every freight car is marked plainly upon its sides . Present orders are to follow strictly that rating in its loading . As a matter of fact , however , the modern freight car is built to haul a load ten per cent or more over its rated capacity ; so that you easily may load at least fifty-five tons of solid freight into one of these new fifty-ton boxes . . . that is if your freight is solid and is not subject to damage when too heavy a load is piled atop it , such as : flour in paper sacks ; or potatoes ; or men 's shirts in cardboard containers . . . such cases are provided for as exceptions to the general rule . It is not the precise letter of the law but the principle of the thing that is to be maintained . Again , as in the dire case of threatened passenger rationing , the Office of Defense Transportation together with the Association of American Railroads took the sensible view that decent appeals to shippers would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes ill considered rs . . . . That was Ralph Budd 's practice , earlier in the re . . . . With a few military exceptions , there was no more need for priorities in freight transport than in passenger . u did not mislead shippers , they would not mislead you . Here is a sort of Golden Rule , streamlined to fit the war transport situation of the railroads.  | Take the case of so-called " cross-hauling " for example . Obviously , it is wasteful transport to haul a trainload of steel all the way from Pittsburgh , or any other large producing center , say to iron-bound Birmingham to there fabricate it for machinery to be used back in Pittsburgh . Two thousand miles of unnecessary and expensive haul . There were lean days when Old Man Railroad would have relished that sort of coals-to-Newcastle trick . But those were not the days when he was hard-pressed to find cars and locomotives to meet the carriage of the flood of freight steadily pressing in upon him . . . . Why haul beer from Milwaukee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a local brewery can produce practically as good a product ; why haul beer from the local brewery out to Milwaukee and St. Louis , who both admit for themselves a sort of superiority in the product ? California citizens would employ West Coast oil production irrespective of any preferences say for Pennsylvania products . That is what we mean by cross-hauling . You can find and multiply the instances for yourself . Some of the boys down at Washington felt that they might produce some pretty nice regulation in this sort of thing . In fact , one of them produced a questionnaire , a sample copy of which was submitted to a trader , who , competent as he was , needed five hours to fill it out correctly . What that document would have been in the hands of an incompetent is your own guess . . . . The thing can be far better worked out by understanding . At least , that is the way that both Eastman and Gormley think and they are no novices in this field . In fact , Mike Gormley is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with our heavy war construction ceasing , we can wiggle along pretty well on our present fleet of 1,890,000 freight cars .  | Locomotives are different again . Locomotives obviously require vastly more maintenance than cars ; and under the tremendous pressure of the moment , some of our locomotives are beginning to run a bit on borrowed time . By the autumn of 1943 there will be a need for shopping a good many of them in a rather extensive fashion . You can not run any machine , not even a stock , 400-ton , steam locomotive , forever without giving it some time and attention in the backshop . And the Diesels with their more delicate mechanism require even more attention . Fortunately , we are very well fitted in this country for the production of locomotives of all types : steam , diesel , and electric . Some of the larger roads , notably the Pennsylvania , the Burlington , and the Louisville and Nashville , have stuck pretty faithfully to a long-established practice of making much of their steam motive power in their own shops ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose engines for long years past have gone steaming valiantly out to nearly every corner of the civilized world . The other day I ventured into the chief plant of the American Locomotive Company ? its historic works at Schenectady , New York , which have been turning out iron horses for very nearly a century now .... I found the plant in very full production , its normal working force five times that of two years before , and more than one locomotive a day coming out from it , in addition to tanks , gun-carriages , and other munitions of war . The American Locomotive Company in its various factories in the United States and Canada is today the largest builder of tanks for the United Nations , and this , in addition to those forty locomotives a month rolling out of the Schenectady works . There are not many of these engines for private owners nowadays . The larger part of them by far is for Army use ... .  | The Schenectady plant has done some rather fine private jobs within the past two or three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for New York Central . . . twenty magnificent machines , designed for pulling with equal facility either freight or passenger trains for Delaware and Hudson .. . and forty of those marvelous " Big Boys " for Union Pacific 's staunch grades over the crest of the Rockies . The Schenectady stud breeds a highly varied type of Iron Horse ? types that are adapted to almost every sort of running condition . Most of its present colts are war stallions . They are built to at least three gauges ? narrow , standard and wide . It has long been the fashion of European railways to be rather individual about their track gauges ; even though the sleeping cars of the Wagons Lits company do go over the lines of twenty-two countries over there without changing either trucks or wheels . . . . Spain has an " off gauge " and so has Russia . The oldtime leaders of those nations had a phobia about cars and engines of potentially warring countries entering upon their well guarded tracks . Change of gauge seemed to be the safest protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment from venturing into other lands apparently was beside the point . . . . The clearances upon European railways , fixed almost irrevocably by many oldtime tunnels and bridges , usually are far less than those upon American railroads . Therefore , locomotives to go overseas must be lower and narrower ? shorter as well ? which means that a 150-ton engine is about the maximum weight to send overseas . The engines that are going over today are almost precisely the same type and size as those that went to France in 1917 and 1918 . That type and size proved its effectiveness in World War I , so there was no particular need of changing either ; in consequence , much drafting-room time and labor was saved . Some of them are designed with grates to burn coal ; others with burners for fuel-oil . Almost every operating condition seemingly has been met . . . . Not a few of them are of the Diesel type . . . . Ordinarily , it will take about three weeks from the time the word " go " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficient Schenectady plant . The latest one of the Delaware and Hudson was done in ten days ? start to finish . And , with the plant working day and night , seven days a week , three weeks is a longish time to turn out even one of the biggest of these war babies . Even Henry Kaiser might marvel at the efficiency of the place . Certainly Henry Kaiser would get a burst of enthusiasm to look down the three hundred feet of high-vaulted room ? like the nave or a cathedral of industry ? and in the dusk of a shortening December afternoon see a giant boiler and fittings come riding down upon a crane , a crane capable of handling a 150-ton load as easily as a package carrier in a department store picks up and sets down a pasteboard carton with a pair of my lady 's shoes . . . . The man ( in at least one case at Schenectady it is a woman ) manipulates the crane- levers with an ease that is born of long experience .

Drivers and trucks already have been placed under the frame . Soon the workmen will be swarming all over the engine , putting on the cab , the headlight , this gadget and that . . . . The electricians and the painters will follow . . . . Soon the nice , bright tender will be rolled in from the tank-shop and coupled on to the engine ... after which the newest Iron Horse in all the land will be ready to go into service on this side of the seven seas ? or on that . The building of a locomotive like the building of a ship or an airplane ? or an automobile ? is more of an assembly job than anything else . The frames for the boiler , the trucks and the tender will have come for a fat journey far across the land , perhaps from a distant steel mill which specializes in that sort of thing . . . wheels from another . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . springs from another ... feed-water heaters , superheaters , valve-gears , automatic controls , signals , electrical appliances , even couplings ? all from factories that hold valuable patents and devote themselves to this particular kind of thing . They do make boilers there in the Schenectady works , boilers with enough strength and power to send a mighty locomotive , with a 5000-ton train behind it through the air at sixty miles an hour or even more . They grind out their cylinders and their wheels and the shiny manganese-steel rods that connect them with a marvelous precision . Toleration is the word they use when they wish to express the latitude given the men who grind and fit together these swift-moving parts . The toleration allowed one of these giant locomotives as high as a bungalow and as long as a cloud or a church is something less than one one-thousandth of an  | inch . Slinky , smooth-running , silent . Remember that there must be neither knock nor pound to the modern locomotive .

Their works already were well-tooled for this sort of production . . . . Since the beginning of World War II , they have been tremendously expanded . To bring frames from East St. Louis and airbrakes from Watertown and engine-units from Auburn and all the rest of the hundred and one parts that go into the making of a modern locomotive , is still another wartime task for Old Man Railroad ....

And Old Man Railroad will have finished another of his many wartime tasks .  | LOCOMOTIVES , cars , and terminals are all very well and good , but they are worth little or nothing if traffic fails to flow freely through the railroads .

If the roads , working in close cooperation with the Army and the Navy , had not long since thought out the plan of storing export munitions and freight elsewhere than in the freight cars for miles back of the major ports , we would be in a very sad plight .... However , freight today does move upon the rails in steadily increasing volume and with steadily increasing speed . A great proportion of it is inland transport only , and , having no connection with the sea-flow , should not be impeded by it . It is not being impeded . It is flowing freely and quickly ; in fine and highly modern equipment of every sort it is flowing . . . . The railroads are doing a good job , a mighty good job . But they could not do that job if they did not have cooperation : men and physical facilities ? rolling-stock , tracks , terminals and yards . Consider for a moment the railroad yard .

To handle its complex problem of transport at a time when it , too , is faced with its own wartime overloads and its own shortage of man power , the Post Office Department has set up its own intricate machinery . Your letters to Boston , to Atlanta and to San Francisco are but a tiny fraction of a vast problem recurring each day .

All of this , the perfection of a truly magnificent system , is time-tried and efficient . The railroad yard is to freight what the post office is to the mails , only instead of letters , it is constantly sorting freight cars . As illustrative of the workings of this vast interchange system , take a single one of these tense ganglia . For military reasons it must not be mentioned by name or location at this time . For nine long miles it stretches itself . It actually begins just west of a busy inland city , reaches around that town , and  | terminates in a mighty bulge of trackage over the flat lands on the East .

Ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon its many sidings and still leave both yard and main tracks completely usable . But the precise idea in the war transport job of the railroads is not to stow away freight cars on sidings . The big idea is to keep them moving ? eternally moving ? moving both day and night . A stalled loaded freight car , whether it be bound to shipyard or anywhere else in God 's creation , is an abomination to your railroader of this year of grace ? 1943 . Keep ' em moving ; that 's the idea ! That 's the idea at The Yard ! Its heaviest movement , normally , is eastbound freight .. . Side by side at the far east end of the yard lie forty-three classification tracks , so-called , each capable of receiving a hundredcar train . This eastbound yard is capable of eighty-three " classifications " each twenty-four hours . Thirty-five eastbound trains will pass out from it in the course of a day and a night , and some of them will require as high as five or six classifications each . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the switching process by which the cars that pull into the yard on the long trains from far distant , western points are broken up and sorted out into trains for the East , where operating conditions are a bit more congested and difficult . Almost the entire practise of the operation of all the great railroad yards across the land changed some fifty years ago when yard " humps " first came into popular usage .  | The hump is simplicity itself : a slight rise of twelve or twenty feet in a main switching or " lead " track ? just enough of an elevation to send cars down by gravity and at an easily controlled speed on to one receiving track or another . Thus , at the eastbound Yard each one of the forty-three parallel classification tracks represents a separate group or classification . Switching is done by locomotives and by men . For switching service alone , a fleet of from twenty-five to thirty locomotives constantly is employed . That is a fleet large enough for a good-sized railroad . At the moment , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which does not give much time to lay up engines either for repairs , or for idling in roundhouse stalls . In action , the switching locomotive places itself back of a string of cars just in from the West and slowly pushes them up the hump . At the summit they are uncoupled , one from the other , and then , one by one , they go sliding down by gravity each into its proper track and classification . By the time a classification track is filled , there stands upon it a train , ready to receive its locomotive and caboose and proceed upon its way East . . . After that the track which it has vacated is ready for a fresh classification . The process is unending . In other days the custom was to have a brakeman ride each freight car as it went rolling slowly down the hump into its destination track . This took many men and also created a problem in bringing them all back to the top of the hump again , ofttimes a considerable distance . Then , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slower walking . All manner of devices came into being to bring the riders back up the hill . None of them , however , was particularly successful . The problem finally was solved by a brilliant railroad operating man , the late George Hannauer , who invented what  | he called the car-retarder . Automatically controlled by the towerman at the crest of the hump , it consisted of movable lengths of rail set inside the track , which would catch the car wheels gently and bring them almost to a halt , just short of the waiting string . A brakeman with his coupling stick would do the rest . It never seems feasible to avoid entirely the human element . The Yard makes no pretense of avoiding the human element . Around the clock a thousand men are employed upon the humps , in the assembling and repair tracks , and in the giant double roundhouse with its fifty-two stalls , each good for a hundred-foot locomotive . The secret of a well-operated railroad yard is not to have locomotives standing in the roundhouses ? not for very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gruelling run upon the open road , must have attention and inspection . Not infrequently fires must be dumped and rebuilt , flues blown out , a hundred minor adjustments made ? " running repairs " they call them in the roundhouse . Larger repairs , more thorough overhaulings made at least once a year , are in the " back shop " of the company 's nearest works . Traffic must move . The days when a locomotive could come ambling off its inbound train and loaf a pleasant ten to twelve hours , before picking up a fresh train and going out upon its labors on the road once again are gone . Wartime energy is abounding in the Iron Horse and the men who serve him . Four-and-a-half hours is now the average time for engine turn-around and by the time that this is read , it may be shorter still . The yardmasters steadily are working for its perfection . Traffic must move .  | Higher and still higher mount the figures . Out from The Yard are now moving each twenty-four hours an average of thirty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the train . West from The Yard trains easily average from 100 to 110 or even 125 cars . But eastbound , with an average loading of upwards of forty tons to the car , you will have a daily movement of close to 150,000 tons . And this takes no reckoning of the many eastbound trains that go through The Yard ? coal trains ... trains of refrigerators . . . oil tank trains . . . without classification and with no stop save a brief one for changes of engines and crews . Traffic must flow and does flow . When winter comes and the canal that runs back of my old house freezes four inches thick ; when the great Ontario just to the North of me and all the other Great Lakes for miles out from shore are solid sheets of ice ; and , when , with the exception of the stout , year ' round , ice-breaking ferries across the Lakes , all navigation is halted upon them ; when snow and low-ceilinged clouds shut off air transport ; when the icecovered highroads are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still sticks to the job . His henchmen in The Yard also stick to the job . The sturdy switch engines blow their exhaust , white against the crisp , sunlight , zero air . Lanterns bobbing , signals changing in the great , flood-lighted place at night . . . . Archangel , Russia upon a winter day hardly can be colder than upper New York State or the Pennsylvania mountains . Yet , clockround , the railroaders stick to it . They stomp and curse a bit , build trackside fires to throw the signals and the switches and to keep  | themselves warm , run , with their stout coupler-sticks , up and down and in between the long lines of cars , watching their footing all the while against icy ground and slippery steel rail ... . The men on the subchasers in the wintry waters of the North Atlantic ? those fellows whose pictures you see in all the illustrated papers ? have no more hazardous duties than these railroaders who are helping win the war by keeping the freight moving toward the front through The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belt of North America . . . . Unseen and unsung , they , too , are doing their full part toward the winning of the war . Traffic must flow . And traffic does flow . And oil flows , flows not alone in the great pipe lines that reach nearly all the way across the continent , but in these hustling , bustling days in long trains of grimy tank cars upon the railroad . It is more difficult at this time to write of oil transport than of any other phase of the war effort . Almost every day new and conflicting statements come out of new and conflicting departments down in Washington . This man says this and that man says that and Mr. Average Motorist and the souls who used to boast of the new , oil-heaters in their basements , hardly know which way to turn . They fill out vast and portentous blank-forms , are cuffed and pushed this way and that with all their pathways and their misunderstandings sadly confused ... . Last summer I drove my car to our neighboring city of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast smudge of an oil fire was ascending to the high heavens . It was gasoline , gaso- line being burned to get rid of it , while both in Buffalo and in the Rochester that I see from my study window , we poor mortals had been placed upon a pretty tight system of rationing : " A " cards , " B " cards and " C " cards . Apparently , you had either to lie your life away or be a local politician to get yourself into these last two slightly more generous categories . Last summer I found the pipe line leading up from the western Pennsylvania oil country into Syracuse had been plugged up and was resting absolutely idle , while the town itself was worrying its poor head off about fuel oil and gasoline . Rochester , also , has its pipe lines , put in many years ago when the town was a pioneer in refining of lubricating oils ; but these still are in operation . Perhaps , if Washington ever hears of them , they , too , will be plugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here in the Rochester district we live nearly on the edge of the New York State oil fields which have a producing capacity of nearly 5,000,000 barrels annually . The western Pennsylvania oil fields , of nearly three times this capacity , are within 175 miles of us . All of them are being worked to fullest capacity .... The reason that I saw the gasoline being burned in Buffalo was because the petroleum was being worked out in a nearby refinery to obtain certain oils highly essential to the war effort ? for the nonce , gasoline was a by-product and for lack of storage room or proper drainage it was being burned , while motorists stood in actual need of it . This was all because the politico mayor of New York had decreed that , just because his own subjects , due to unforeseen emergency transport conditions , could receive no generous amounts of gas , we western New Yorkers should similarly be penalized . Dog eat dog , or something of that sort . As a most logical follow-up Leon Henderson , William M. Jeffers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasoline-soaked Middle West  | on a quaint notion of saving our rubber tires by discipline and compulsory renunciation . The same policy later was extended to fuel oil . The entire theory of oil transport into the northeastern corner of the United States has been one of water transport . There are the pipe lines into western New York ? to Buffalo , to Rochester and to Syracuse , also the one to New Jersey 's great refinery at Bayonne on the edge of New York harbor . Most of these are minor in their capacity . The main mass of pipe line is in the middle portion of the country where they lie , thick and frequent , contiguous to the heavy production territory . For remember that the sizable 5,000,000 barrels from our western New York fields are not quite a third of the annual output of the western Pennsylvania ones , and that the combined output of the two is but one-third that of Kansas , oneninth that of Oklahoma and one-twentieth that of Texas . The Northeast normally has drawn its oil supplies chiefly from Texas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than half that of Oklahoma .... Arkansas , with a production equal to that of New York and Pennsylvania comhined , also contributes its supply to the northeastern territory with the exception , of course , of a considerable export trade .... Less than two per cent of the normal oil movement into the Northeast is by railroad tank car . Water movement is riot only , in many ways , more efficient but it is far cheaper than rail . More and more , the big oil companies have come to it . They have built their own fleets of wonderfully efficient tankers , pouring no small part of their earnings into them .... This water-borne traffic at the beginning of 1942 had attained  | an average daily volume of 1,200,000 barrels , as against less than 20,000 daily by rail . These are not normal times . When Hitler 's submarines began to strike at North Atlantic shipping with a deadly efficiency , and export freight began to pile up beside the rails for 750 miles west of New York and Boston , tankers bringing the Northeast its precious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean with an almost uncanny precision . The fat was in the fire . The oil was in the water . The toll was heavy . The toll was deadly . Moreover , the tankers were being requisitioned in increasing numbers for an overseas movement of oil ? both military and lend-lease ? in all its forms . . . . At the same time , from 1,200,000 barrels daily , North Atlantic coastal traffic fell to about 200,000 barrels . Oil reserves in the Northeast dropped dangerously . A really critical situation was at hand . Almost overnight the entire oil picture in the East was changed . Semi-panic developed both in oil and in governmental circles . The nation got its first dose of rationing . On May 22 , 1942 , a somewhat clumsily designed system went into effect in the seventeen states of the Atlantic seaboard from Maine to Florida . Because they were in a production terrain almost flooded with oil , the western portions of New York , Pennsylvania and Maryland were at first exempt from these provisions . Later , when the first rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were included , which , senseless as it seemed , and much of it really was senseless , caused much anguish and protest .... By the end of the year , Mr. Ickes and Mr. Jeffers had come into the motoring picture and gas rationing was made nationwide . The excuse was the naive idea of saving a nation 's rubber tires , rapidly running themselves to extinction with no replenishment in view .  | In it was Old Man Railroad making his appearance once again , Old Man Railroad , already pretty badly overburdened , was asked to come and take his place the preceding autumn . To almost any other transport organization in the world this added transport problem would have been impossible ; but to Old Man Railroad , right here in the U. S. A. , apparently no problem is impossible . He does not even know the meaning of the word . He surveyed the picture . The tank car fleet of the United States , suitable for the transport of oil , was about 125,000 cars . Of these less than 9000 were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonged to the producing companies , to tank car leasing companies , or to very large consumers of oil . The steadily encroaching pipe lines in the Midwest had been all too keenly reflected in a steadily decreasing oil traffic upon all the railroads . Tank cars by the hundreds and the thousands began to idle upon the sidings . In the midsummer of 1941 it was estimated that over twenty thousand of these cars were so idle . Here a twelvemonth later was Old Man Railroad , already loaded to the hilt with swiftly increasing wartime traffic , being asked to accept a fresh burden even though it took the sole use of 1400 of his none-too-large locomotive fleet . He took it all in his stride .... Early 1942 saw the submarine menace in the North Atlantic swiftly assuming dangerous proportions . Long trains of tank cars began to move exclusive- ly up into the Northwest .... Some of them came in solid units all the way from Oklahoma and Texas . Others were lined out for shorter distances . The average round-trip journey for a tank car ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen . Pipe lines which , for one reason or another had fallen into disuse , quickly were put to work again . One such , ending at Lima , Ohio , began pouring its crude oil into tank cars destined for a 700-mile run to a refinery in New Jersey , where the cars were unloaded with lightning rapidity and at once returned to Lima for a fresh refilling .... Whiting , Indiana and Columbus , Ohio , are other points , reasonably close to the Northeast , where transfer of this oil was and still is being made . Normal oil movements on the Mississippi and the Ohio rivers was , as one already has seen , completely reversed . And so was the flow in certain pipe lines . Tank cars , some of them designed primarily for other commodities , were gathered in from every corner of America 's far-flung railroad system . Oil movement quickly was organized into a rail movement of regimental proportions . Each month in the summer of 1942 saw it in an ascending spiral until one week in September brought 550,000 barrels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seaboard . Thereafter , there was a decline . The strain on some of the older cars was beginning to tell . It became necessary to withdraw them from service and send them to shops for repairs . Some four thousand tank cars had to be withdrawn for other emergency uses . Bad weather conditions also began to come into the picture .... The weekly figure dropped ... ten ... twenty ... thirty ... fifty thousand cars . Washington , always inclined to be panicky , became alarmed . Mr. Ickes , to whom had been given large powers in the oil situation , beat his breast and stormed . Out of all the storming and breast-beating and general con- fusion there has finally emerged a definite plan for a new , 24-inch pipe line all the way from Texas and Oklahoma up to Norris City , Illinois , where a terminal and distributing center into tank cars was to be established . Just why Norris City was chosen is not entirely clear . You will have to study your Rand-NcNally map pretty carefully to locate it .... As a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eastern terminal of the pipe line project . The highly ingenious Mr. Ickes , having in a manner of speaking ousted the highly ingenious Mr. Nelson of the W.P.B. in the matter of priorities for the line into southern Illinois , the continuation of that line to the seaboard with a daily delivery of 400,00 barrels became merely a matter of time ? not too long a time it was to be hoped . The line up from the Southwest into Norris City was finished late in 1942 , but it was not put to work at once. * Mr. Ickes again began to beat his breast and rant and rave . His particular peeve was at John J. Pelley , president of the Association of American Railroads , because of what he considered an " increasing breakdown of oil delivery " on the part of the roads . It is not necessary to have a brief either for or against Mr. Pelley to remind Mr. Ickes that at that moment he was very much within a glass house ? and rocking the windowglass . For , although at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to some small oversights , the pumps that were supposed to send the vital oil surging through it would not be completed for another five or six weeks . In the meantime , the quietly efficient Joseph B. Eastman set 900,000 barrels as a minimum daily delivery for the East . That , I am afraid , has been all too typical of a good deal of this oil transport situation . There has been a great deal of  | unhappiness and not a few lost tempers in it . With the end not yet in sight . But , with the new 24-inch pipe line rushing oil up and into New York harbor , there should be a real relief by the summer of 1943 , and a little happier time for the householder and the motorist .  | IF You had chanced to be almost anywhere along a main line railroad within the past year , you may have noticed the engine of a train under the control of a man in the uniform of the United States Army . If you had been privileged to go further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad , you would have seen more men in uniform at the desks of the trainmaster and of the despatcher ? perhaps even at that of the superintendent of the division , himself . In the nearby roundhouse you would have found other men in uniform , busy at the thousand and one tasks of operating a railroad in wartime . Had Uncle Sam suddenly reached out and taken over that railroad for himself and his own necessities ? Not a bit of it . We have not come to that as yet and probably will not come to it . That railroad was doing a sort of volunteer job ; it was , in part at least , turning over one of the busiest and most important stretches of its line to the Army , turning it over as a sort of training school or proving ground for the latter 's efforts . In an earlier chapter we have seen how Iron Horse long ; ago went into warfare ? in the almost-forgotten days of the Crimean War ... in our own Civil War ... in the FrancoPrussian ... elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take over the railroads in order to meet emergency needs . The work of Thomas A. Scott and Daniel C. McCullum and Herman Haupt in Virginia , in Georgia and in Tennessee in that conflict remains one of the most brilliant pages of our railroad history . Gradually there has been developed in the headquarters of our Army a fairly definite plan for the use of the railroad as an immediate adjunct to military effectiveness . Long years before the advent of the motor truck as an army asset and while the horse ? and the Missouri mule ? still reigned supreme , for short transport at least , there was being perfected a plan to use the Iron Horse for heavier loads and for longer distances . Not for long-distance haul of men and munitions ? especially within this country ; that was a task that was so uncertain and which , in an emergency , might suddenly become of such magnitude that the well-trained civilian operating forces of the American Railroad would have to be pressed into service to attain it with any efficiency . There have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought on this . Some Army officers have felt themselves abler in train movement than oldtime operating men . Once or twice there have been clashes and words between them . But the wiser Army executives accept and follow the suggestion and advice of the railroads in almost all of this . We already have seen how very well the railroads have handled both troop and munitions in the present conflict , even with their existing civilian forces . But for purely military railroad services ? in some cases right up to the battle front , as well as for services of all sorts in foreign lands that are under invasion , the Army feels , and there can be but little dispute about it , that this is a matter that should be entirely within its hands ? kept as a purely military function . Many years ago the Chief of Engineers of the United States  | Army was authorized to establish a military railway service for the operation of railroads for the Army , both at home and abroad . Recently , however , this service was taken out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Service of Supply ? as one of its most active military enterprises .  | Long since , the Army engineering services were divided into two major divisions : the military and the civil engineering . At the beginning , the Army interested itself keenly in the great engineering enterprises as they came into existence across a new nation . It possessed in its Military Academy at West Point a superb school of engineering which for years was the only technical college in the United States . It sent its peacetime graduates in every direction . The first extensive railroad in the United States , the Baltimore and Ohio , was , in its earlier stages at least , designed and supervised by a young lieutenant from West Point , one George W. Whistler , who later laid out the Boston and Lowell and the extensive power-and-factory development at Lowell . Still later he worked on that remarkable piece of railroad engineering over the Berkshires that is remarkable even to this day , the Western Railroad of Massachusetts ( the present Boston and Albany ) . It was this supreme achievement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build Russia 's first real railway from St. Petersburg to Moscow for which he was awarded great riches and distinction .... Other Army engineers here in the United States built other early railroads ... canals ... high- roads .... Finally , the entire task of the improvement of the larger rivers of the land to make them more easily navigable was thrust into the Army 's capable hands . That is a task which it has never relinquished . Harbor improvements go along with river ones . At the very beginning of the overseas part of World War II , the distinguished Major ( now Brigadier-General ) John J. Kingman , who was working on improvements in the busy harbor of Milwaukee , foresaw the situation that was to arise and recommended that the entire military railroad service of the army be reorganized and that Carl R. Gray , Jr. , Executive Vice President of the " Omaha Road , " as the Chicago and North Western 's northern affiliate generally is known , be placed at its head . The suggestion was followed . It would be hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Throughout his lifetime he has been schooled to become the thoroughly efficient railroader that he is today . His father , an earlier Carl R. Gray , as president of the widespread Union Pacific , was one of the ablest and most beloved railroaders of his day and generation ? a man whose tact and judgment always was respected . Carl R. Gray , Jr. , at first Colonel and now Brigadier-General Carl R. Gray , Jr. , USA , if you please , started at his new task with one very definite idea . If the Army had railroads to run , they should be organized and staffed as commercial railroads and run as railroad men would run them . Right from the very outset they should be organized in this manner . The operating unit of the railroad in the United States is the division , which may be twenty miles long or six hundred ,  | depending very largely upon the density and character of the traffic to be handled . Above and below that unit the railroad becomes more and more departmental . This tendency is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the division at one time was almost supreme . The chef - de- gare of a French chemin-de- f er hardly was more of a czar and an autocrat , demanding his personal permission for the departure of every train from his station , than a good , well-established division superintendent upon the oldtime , Pennsylvania railroad . A practice which today has largely continued on that extremely well-run railroad .... On the other hand , the almost equally extensive and well-run New York Central always has favored the departmental system . The division engineer , perhaps sitting in the very next office to the division superintendent , does not report to him but to the company 's vicepresident in charge of engineering at its New York headquarters . So with the divisional passenger and freight representatives .... There are agitated arguments for and against both methods of organization ; each has its warm advocates ; but even in the highly departmental system , the division is the recognized unit . Therefore , in General Gray 's scheme of things for the United States Military Railroad , the army battalion is a railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of grand division often under a general superintendent , sometimes under a general manager . On the Military Railroad a single division will be planned to handle from ninety to 150 miles of track ; a grand division from 270 to 500 miles in all . It becomes in name and in fact an Army Railway Grand Division . Starting with the division unit there will be at least four companies to the battalion that personifies it . There will be a headquarters and service company , looking chiefly after the  | Housing and the mess ( two large problems which do not arise iii ordinary railroad operation ) and supplies , as well as supplying the chief train despatcher , who is ranked as an army lieutenant ... another company with a ( roadmaster ) captain to look after the maintenance of way , which may involve the putting down and taking up of track as well as bridge and building work ... a third , for the purely mechanical work of the division ? with its captain , a practical railroad master mechanic , in charge of maintenance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth , or transportation company , with a trainmaster as captain and his lieutenants as road foremen of engines , yardmasters and the like .... A typical unit of this sort has twenty-three officers and 857 men .... In addition to these there are railroad shop battalions of 23 officers and ( 357 men each for the heavier locomotive and car repairs as needed . These groups are built up of men well experienced in railroad shop work . Some twenty of them are already in the Military Railway ? about fifteen per cent of the railroad personnel already enrolled in the Army and the Navy . Throughout the military railroad organization officers , who tire assigned with military ranks from second lieutenant to brigadier-general also carry the appropriate railroad designations . The commander of the whole service , Brigadier-General Gray , is known as the General Manager ; the chief of the transportation department is known as the Assistant General Manager of Transportation , and he has in his department a general superintendent , a general superintendent of car service , a general superintendent of terminals and a superintendent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is known as Assistant General Manager of  | Equipment and is a general superintendent of motive power . He has under him a superintendent of cars , a superintendent of shops , a mechanical engineer and an assistant in the car department . The effort , of course , at all times is to place in each of these posts men already well experienced in their particular line of work . All of this took time at the beginning ; but the result has more than justified the effort . Putting the right peg in the right hole generally does pay . All of these men were capable railroaders long before World War II came into its dour existence . Some of them enlisted and some were drafted into service , but that really makes no difference . The railroaders , old and young , have responded to war service with an astounding loyalty . Perhaps not so astonishing when one realizes that railroaders , even in their peacetime job , really are soldiers in a well-trained army ,  | energetic , vigorous , unrelenting . In the very nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cooperative effort , to expect the unexpected and to be prepared and forever ready for it . A test that was made of one battalion in Texas showed something of the years of actual railroad experience that are back of the United States Military Railway today . That census showed an average of 42'years of railroad service for the 857 enlisted men and of 19 ; 2 years for the 23 officers . Not one of them was without some actual railroad experience . General Gray has estimated that the first fifteen thousand men who came to him represented well over sixty thousand years of railroad experience . The railroad ? I mean the civilian railroad right here within the United States that is doing both military and civilian tasks ? is an agent of essential necessity in the winning of the war . Yet , of its million workers it already has given over one hundred thousand of them to the Army , and more will be forthcoming . Faced with the need of expanding its rolls rather than decreasing them , it has called many of its retired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing numbers and for an increasing variety of jobs . Travelers lately may have noticed the smartly dressed , young , women ticket sellers in many of the larger railroad stations across the land . They not so often see the women who have less attractive tasks ? car cleaners , window washers , even , to a slight extent , workers in shops and in yards . They are a new type of recruit for Old Man Railroad , but he is duly appreciative of them all . To build up almost overnight this well-spread railroad organization of well-qualified men , the Army asked the co- operation of the existent roads . Specifically , they were asked to accept sponsorship of various units for the Military Railway . To a road , the American railroads at once responded , despite the fact that it meant thinning their ranks of men more needed than at any time in recent history . Some of the posts in particular were not easy to fill without robbing the roads of valuable trained personnel . But gradually the Army allotments were filled . Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of at least one unit , a goodly portion of these , two ... New York Central , Santa Fe , Union Pacific and Southern Pacific took four , the Pennsylvania , six .... Even the steam locomotive and Diesel builders contributed much needed men to the shop units . Some of the smaller roads particularly in the Northeast , which already were short-handed , grouped themselves together to form a unit .... The response was all but universal . When he makes up his mind to do it , Old Man Railroad generally does a thing in a generous and big way .... By the beginning of 1942 the railroad boys already were responding to the colors in numbers and with enthusiasm . Officers and men for the military railway , once inducted , spend their first month in the Army in a camp which specializes in military training exclusively . Here , they are trained separately . " Squads left , " " Squads right , " all the rest of military routine and rigor are the order of the day . First of all they are taught to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men of their first command . In another camp there are eight weeks more of military training ? this time officers and enlisted men together .... After that , back to the railroad once again . But  | not to the old familiar line . It may be to the Southern ; the Pennsylvania , New York Central , The Santa Fe , the Missouri Pacific , the Texas and New Orleans ? any of a dozen others who have offered their division organizations as trainingschools of a new type . Some of these roads already have had a deal of experience in training young men to be minor operating officers . Young men , brought in from college or high school by organized plan , have sat in division train despatchers ' offices at their desks and in the busy little offices of widespread yards , studying in minute detail the working of these highly practical railroad organisms .... Now there are other strangers at these old desks , and now they are by no means young men just out of high school or college . They are serious-minded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , studying , studying , studying all the while ? long hours and hard .... One of these fine days the old despatcher slips out from his accustomed seat ; the man in uniform replaces him , gives instructions to the line telegraph operators for this train to move this way and that to move that .... Four to meet Eleven at Railroad Mills , First Seventeen to make an unaccustomed stop at Derryville .... The old yardmaster slips out of his seat ... soon this fellow in olive-drab is operating the east-bound hump and doing a pretty good job of it . Perhaps , the next railroad yard he will be operating will be off in France somewhere , and the dingy , little , gray and red , four-wheeled freight cars will have " Hommes 40 ? Chevaux 8 " painted on their sides . Who knows ? Six to nine months of this intensive training ? army despatcher seated by railroad despatcher ... army line operator beside railroad line operator ... even an army " callboy " with a railroad " call-boy " ... army engineer in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after a while and an acquaintance with the line , taking over the  | throttle himself , while the regular man sits behind him and calls off the signals to him . There might be a better training for an army railroad corps , but it is hard to imagine just how or where . And suddenly an army railroad with wartime conditions somewhat approximating those overseas comes into existence right here in this country . Here is a real stage rehearsal . Two camps , situated fifty miles apart in Louisiana , completely lack adequate intercommunication . Marsh country , absolutely unfit for good highroad construction to permit the passage of trucks and jeeps and the rest of them . An ancient logging railroad , abandoned in every sense of the word , connecting them . The men who own the right-of-way of the erstwhile railroad quite unwilling to do business with the Army , at least , at what the Army feels is a fair price .... Gray met the situation with characteristic definiteness . When the logging-road president could not come to satisfactory terms with the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Claiborne and Camp Polk , which would continue on beyond each of them to join the lines of the Missouri Pacific and the Kansas City Southern roads . He began , with the help of the forces at his command , to build a new right-of-way straight across the open country . At the last moment he managed to find a right-of-way of another logging railroad , long since abandoned , and made use of a part of that . The men who set out to do this job chanced to be an engineer battalion , the 711th Operating Battalion , made up of railroaders from a number of roads . They started in late in  | August , 1941 , using their own corps of surveyors , working both from Claiborne and from Polk , making their way through grassy fields , swamps , woods and now and then across one of the sizable streams that abound in Louisiana . One of their aims was to minimize earthwork as well as bridges wherever possible and still produce a good , usable railroad . For this reason , the road as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines as closely as it was possible to fit a railroad location over ridges and through valleys . Final plans called for a maximum gradient of 132 per cent ; before the line was completed , this last was raised to 2 per cent . But it still was pretty good railroad . This little Claiborne-Polk Military Railway , completed , with appropriate " last spike " ceremonies , July 11 , 1942 , is a sort of final training-school or proving-ground for the railroad military forces of the Army . One of the interesting features  | about its operation is that it is run on Greenwich civil time , the 24-hour clock system so common to continental railways in Europe and once introduced into the western hemisphere in Western Canada with rather indifferent success . When one becomes accustomed to it , it is not difficult at all . It starts at midnight and runs quite normally until noon , then goes straight along , completely forgetting the old " PM " designation . Thus a train starting out from Camp Claiborne , say at 2:05 PM , is listed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4:05 would be put down as 16:05 ... etc . That same printed time-table also carries the following message : " Subject to the military situation , safety is of first importance in the discharge of duty . " Up to the beginning of 1943 , the United States Army had embarked upon one other railroad enterprise : Late in the autumn of the preceding year it took over the 3-foot-gauge White Pass and Yukon Railroad , a British-owned property , following ancient trails from the port of Skagway , Alaska over the White Pass to White Horse , Yukon territory ... in Canada .... The value of this small railroad to the war effort at this time easily can be surmised . In the building of the great Alcan Highway , connecting for the first time the United States and its most prized possession , Alaska , this little railroad proved itself a real necessity . It became evident in August 1942 that the private owners of the White Pass and Yukon could not , of their own volition , increase their transport facilities to handle the construction materials for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and so it was that the Army , under the instruction of  | Lieutenant-General Brehon H. Somervell , in charge of the Service of Supply , immediately took over the road , turned it over to the Military Railway Service , which began operating it October 1 , at one minute after midnight . In the meantime , the government had secured from the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad , which operates a decreasing number of narrow-gauge lines , seven locomotives , a rotary snow-plow , and from others fifty box cars and twenty steel flat cars , which were shipped by water to Skagway and put into immediate service on the White Pass and Yukon .... General Gray drew on his personnel ? eleven officers and 450 men ? for the military operation of the road . This force was superimposed on the line 's own civilian personnel . For the White Pass and Yukon differs from the Claiborne-Polk in the fact that it still is operated for public use at established freight and passenger tariffs . It is a valiant little railroad , puffing its engines over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passes that were followed by the goldseekers of the ' 98 rush to the Klondike . It is doing a full and sufficient war job on its own , as well as in connection with the Alcan Highway . It renders full service to the public , that for the Army taking precedence at all times .  | AND here is Tom Turner , doing his own part in the war picture . Tom Turner is no railroader .. He will tell you that , himself ? vigorously . Torn Turner hates railroads . He also will tell you that . You see , young Tom Turner is a sort of competitor of Old Man Railroad . Tom is a trucker . Tom Turner 's truck , the Triple T is what he calls it , makes a weekly trip between Cleveland and New York over Route 6 . Of course , he is a competitor . A big , well-filled , ten ton truck , is something of a common carrier in itself in the course of a year . Triple T is one of a big fleet of motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid a wage , a good wage , and beyond that he is part owner of the truck which bears his name in neat gilt letters on each side . Like his pretty bride and his new steel guitar , it is a source of unending pride . He also pats its sleek sides ? when no one is looking . Tom does not always make the New York run out of Cleveland . It depends a bit upon the freight that is being offered . Sometimes , he will go scooting off in an entirely different direction ? perhaps over to Toledo and up to Detroit , Saginaw or Grand Rapids ... perhaps south , through Cincinnati and Louisville and on to Nashville or Memphis . He has even gone as far as New Orleans .... Tom likes the runs down to Tennessee . He prefers the cooking there and in Kentucky to the Ohio brand . You see , Tom is a big fellow , broad-shouldered ,  | muscular . It takes a lot of food to properly fill a big man , a big man working long hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fodder good . It is a hard life at best ? in bad weather , doubly hard ? guiding a heavy truck over narrow , curving , high-crowned , hill-filled roads , sometimes ice-coated as well or choked by snow ... ducking around drivers whose slow rate of progress clogs the line . .. picking up hastily-cooked chow at almost any hour of day or night ... catching a few hours of daytime sleep in that uncomfortable bunk up back of the driver 's seat . Trucks move by night wherever possible and rest by day . Only a fairly toughened sort of individual can stand the strain . Yet , Tom says that he can take it , and that he would not go back to his old garage job at any price . He knows the every in and out of an automotive engine ; and he knows the pound , and thrill and excitement of the open road . Route 6 , for all of its curves and twists , running tangentlike from Cleveland to New York , is like his own hometown Euclid Avenue . Out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meadville , the " zipper town , " before dawn ? when dawn does not come slipping along too early . Darn nice traffic-cop there in Meadville . Helped Tom out of a mean fix once ? and the truckers do not forget .... Warren , long before noon . Pleasant place to pull up , there by the Alleghany , and take a bit of much-needed snooze . Warren is a pretty river town . Little girl seems always to be playing with a big dog on the front lawn of the large brick house that faces the water .... Wellsboro long before night . Chance for a bit of a rest and a twang at the new guitar . Drifting and Dreaming Tom decided is a good piece for the mood and the moment . Later on after it is dark and the moon lights the countryside , he will pull out his guitar again and give a rendition of By the Light of the Silvery  | Moon . Wellsboro offers you a really good meal . Swell hotel there where you wash your face and hands before you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before you come into Carbondale ; another , not so good , at Honesdale . If you are running late enough , perhaps you can get those French people at Milford to fix you up a hurried breakfast in the bar , a breakfast that you will not forget for another moon .... Stop near Butler to help a woman change her tire . Tip offered . Tip refused . Tom , much aroused , states that he is no waiter . " G. Washington . Br. , N.Y . " by noon and into the lower West Side two hours later .... Snooze .... Sleep in a bed this time .... Gee , what a life ! Multiply your Tom Turners , and your Triple Ts all the way across the land and you begin to get the full scope of the picture . Add to them the almost countless farmers and delivery boys at their steering-wheels and you enter upon its fullness . Half a million trucks in use in the United States at the time of World War I ; nearly five millions of them in use at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many of the truck owners and operators were wise enough to foresee the inevitable , and in 1941 they purchased 700,000 new trucks to build up the fleet ? about the same number was purchased in 1942 . The three million tires of those trucks are coming in pretty handy during the rubber famine . There are folk who question , and who very much question , the wisdom of permitting long-distance trucking upon the highways to more or less directly parallel freight trains on the railroad , especially in this war emergency . There is no shortage of coal with 90,000,000 tons of it , mined and stacked up at the beginning of 1.943 ready for use as needed . There is no  | shortage of steel , comparable with those of fuel oil and rubber . Therefore , argue these thinking folk , why not steel upon steel ( the railroad ) rather than rubber upon concrete ( the highroad ) ? There is sense in this point . But there are any number of reasons why it can not come into being , even as a measure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field of competitive railroading , there are traditions and jealousies to be reckoned with ; out of these jealousies and sharp politics , as well as from the point of view of public weal , a second great land transport system has been built up in this country within the past forty years , and built at public expense . In many , many instances it parallels the rail transport system and in actual mileage , greatly exceeds it .... Built first , as we already have seen , for the passenger automobile ? in numbers always very much in excess of the motor truck ? more recently , as in the case of the Pennsylvania Turnpike and still other super-roads , attention finally is being given to the development of the motor truck highway as such . This magnificent road system ? state-owned , state-built , state-maintained ? stands open for use twenty-four hours each day for him , who wishes to make use of it , rich or poor , powerful or friendless , just as long as he has a jaloppy or truck , battered or otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all tolls ? and is maintained at good efficiency at almost every season of the year , in many cases kept cleared of snow even in the dead of winter . All of this is at no direct cost to the user . Indirectly , he helps pay through taxes on his license plates and his gasoline . *The Pennsylvania Turnpike is a conspicuous exception to this last with its graduated system of tolls for its entire length of 16o miles . For the average car the modest toll charged is approximately one cent a mile .  | The highway user for the most part is an individual , highly individualistic . There are great companies ? some of them owned in part at least by the railroad interests ? that operate long-distance motor truck and bus lines .... There are shrewd and highly efficient associations of the individual truckers who , between them , maintain a " war council , " organize clearing-houses at key points to exchange freight and equipment amongst the carriers , assuring , as far as possible , a full load on every truck that moves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the promotion and publicity of this still new-born American industry . What all this means to Old Man Railroad is not the business of the present chronicle . Yet I can not help but think of a northern New York county-seat where the railroad , that has served it faithfully for almost ninety years past , formerly employed twenty-eight men ? practically all of whom owned their own homes in the village ? and now employs but six or seven . You can see the answer almost any day at five o'clock in the morning ... when the big motor trucks come rolling up from Watertown and points farther South , stop beside the village park , and with their own forces distribute their freight to other ( short distance ) trucks . The village of Canton benefited from the twenty-eight employees of the railroad , but it derives no direct revenue from this new sort of freight business in its midst . On the contrary , it furnishes gratuitously the village street and even a portion of the park for an hour or more for a sort of exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty or at least half so . Of course , when the fearsome northern New York winter comes , when highways are covered with deep drifts of snow and trucks are blocked , there is quick appeal to Old Man Railroad . The old man shakes his head , " No . " He would like to help ; but he no longer has the facilities at hand ? nor the  | men . He let them all go years ago . These days , he is picking up what he can from the through traffic . But this is beside the point , and , as Mr. Rudyard Kipling once said , quite another story . This one concerns the hundred thousand Tom Turners and their trucks in this great land of ours , and the really splendid efforts that they are making to help in the great and unceasing problem of war transport , and in a thousand other ways . A fine report was published in a fairly recent article in the Nation 's Business ( July 1942 ) , which says of them : " Factory production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes not even in the same state . Men with leather gloves grab airplane engine heads as they pour , still hot , out of a Cleveland plant , load them on trucks which have metal floors to prevent burning . Twenty-two hours later , trucks unload them at a Connecticut factory 613 miles away where the engines are assembled . Time for the trip used to be thirty-six hours . " The same article tells of trucks leaving a New England manufacturing plant every six hours , day and night , seven days a week , carrying gears for Navy torpedo boats to deliver them at a Detroit assembly plant 713 miles away thirty-one hours later . That , says the writer of the article , is fifteen hours quicker than any other transport can do it .... A fuse-plug manufacturer uses trucks to link five suppliers . Each day trucks pick up thousands of small castings and move them to his other plants for annealing , machining and plating , ending at the mother plant , where the parts are assembled . There seems to be little real limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's war .  | " For want of a nail , the shoe was lost ; for want of the shoe , the horse was lost ; and for want of a horse , the rider was lost .... " Well , the lack of a nail nearly held up the rush job of building a new Army barracks at Camp Robinson , Arkansas , not so many months ago until a local Tom Turner came rushing through with it ? and a lot of others too . H. C. Smiley , the general traffic manager of a trucking company across the river at Memphis , was sound asleep early one Sunday morning , dreaming , as he put it himself , of truck tires growing on trees in his backyard , when the telephone by his bedside began its vigorous ringing . One of the boys in trouble again , thought Smiley . But it chanced to be a different sort of trouble ... Orgill Brothers Hardware Company , right there in Memphis , was on the wire , saying that the Army Quartermaster Corps had just notified them that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all out of nails and that if they could not have a truckload of them by eight o'clock that morning , four hundred workmen would be held up in their jobs . Smiley forgot about those tires hanging from the tree branches .... " Tell them that we will get them over there on time , " he said ; and in an instant he was out of bed and beginning to dress .... In less than twenty minutes he was at the truck terminal getting out one of its big , semi-trailer jobs .... They had first awakened Smiley at 2:15 A.M. just one hour and five minutes later the nails ? 186 kegs of them weighing about 20,000 pounds ? were rolling out of ancient Memphisby-the-river ... Camp Robinson all of 150 miles away .... Forty minutes later the big truck was at the Arkansas border . There trouble began . Some of the states are pretty fussy these days on their truck  | regulations : weight , length , axle-load , etc . Arkansas is one of these . When the cargo of nails arrived at the Arkansas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . No matter how necessary , how virtuous its wartime errand , it was adjudged illegally loaded ? and that was all that there was to it . Five thousand pounds light on the tractor axle and 3500 pounds over the limit on the trailer one . Arguments did not go .... The whole job had to be unloaded ? and reloaded right there by the roadside . Correctly this time . Twenty minutes were lost ; and Camp Robinson still was more than a hundred miles away . They made it , made it with fifteen minutes ' grace . At 7:45 that morning the nail expedition rolled into camp , and on the stroke of eight the carpenters all were hard at work . " This stuff has got to move fast , " said the government agent . " Is it possible to get it there in three days ? four at most ? " The Carolina Motor Express man nodded his head . He did not know whether to laugh or to get sore . He did neither . He merely noted quietly the other 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can have it there in two days . Second-morning delivery on a job like that is duck soup for our outfit . " " O.K. " said the government man . " Have a truck here tomorrow at 9 o'clock . " The next morning was Sunday . Sharply at nine a truck pulled up at one of the large Indianapolis war plants . It was quickly loaded . Just what was in the load the driver was not to know . One brass-hat sealed it with an Army seal , and when it got to Charleston , another brass-hat would unseal it .  | About 8 o'clock that Sunday evening the telephone rang in the trucking company 's Indianapolis office , long-distance from some roadside place over in Ohio . The trucker had a tale of woe . Everything had been going fine ; then the generator had burned out . No help at hand and the generator was gone beyond repair . " All right , " said Indianapolis . " Stand by . " They smiled to think how cocky they had been about promising second-morning delivery in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A stand-by mechanic in the terminal yanked a generator off another truck , threw it in the repair wagon , hit the road . After six hours of hard work , the stalled truck was on its way again . The promise was kept . The shipment arrived in Charleston at two o'clock second morning . The 873-mile trip , 350 miles of which were over a stiff mountain range , had been accomplished in thirty-six hours including eight hours lost because of the breakdown . These instances can be multiplied ad infinitum . ' They all tell about the same story . Airplane parts being rushed to planes grounded and in distress .... Even Old Man Railroad helped more than once . It is an almost endless story of quick  | wit and vigilance , of truckers refusing to be licked or outwitted either by time or circumstance . There is apparently no limit , whatsoever , as to what these trucks can do . A recent confidential report to Bernard M. Baruch , prepared by the Detroit Board of Commerce , showed that trucks were moving sixty-five per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 741 war plants in Michigan ... that more than a million out of the five million trucks of our national fleet are used on the farms of America in work that ought at least to be regarded as fairly essential ... that twenty ' of our larger cities receive all of their milk by truck ... and that in sixty-eight large markets motor trucks haul in fifty-eight per cent of the livestock ? you really should see the truckloads of young cattle come into the Omaha stockyards almost any morning in the year .... In twelve markets , forty-seven per cent of the fruit and vegetables arrive in this same way ... in sixteen markets , ninety-seven per cent of live poultry and sixty-six per cent of eggs . All by motor truck . Believe it or not , 7.3 per cent of the 350,000,000 tons of bituminous coal that are mined in the United States in an average year , moves by motor truck . In Michigan the figure runs as high as sixty per cent , but Michigan is the Motor State and mines less than half a million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star production states of the lot ? Pennsylvania , with an annual production of nearly  | 78,000,000 tons ? the truck percentage runs over six per cent . This takes no account of the sizable percentage of stolen coal that is bootlegged out of that state each twelvemonth . The motor truck is no respecter of persons , and sometimes he is no respecter of laws . It will be recalled how very popular a privateer he became in days of prohibition .... Even today , hijacking is no unknown sport here in the United States . It is one of the hazards confronting the Tom Turners . The motor truck is no respecter of persons . Over 94,000 of them are now in the service of their arch-enemy , Old Man Railroad ( including his Man Friday , the Railway Express service , which now operates some 14,000 of them ) . Nearly half of these are in store-door delivery service , a much-needed service in which , until recently , the old gentleman lagged rather sadly .... All of this brings to mind the constantly recurring plans to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not seem to think highly of such a plan . Neither does the railroad . There still is much jealousy between them . So it is not likely that much will come of it . And the highly uneconomic system of motor trucks ? much needed elsewhere ? paralleling railroads , which are not up to their necks with traffic and which have plenty of facilities for handling much more freight than they already are handling , probably will continue even in a war emergency . The same situation is very largely true in regard to the buses , many of whom continue to operate parallel to and in direct competition with the railroads , which , in many cases , own a sizable interest in them . A few years ago it began to be regarded as good railroading to slough off to the highway as much local passenger traffic as  | possible ? particularly upon the branch lines . On the highroad Old Man Railroad was under no maintenance expense whatsoever . In the case of many of his smaller branches , long since unprofitable ( even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , it often was regarded as wisdom to abandon first passenger and then all operation ... after that to rip up the rails .... Gradually , the smaller the line , the more popular this pastime became . With the electric interurbans and city street car lines , particularly in the smaller cities , it became a positive revel . Cities as big as Syracuse , Rochester and Buffalo , New York and Atlanta , Georgia and Seattle , Washington ripped up many miles of street railway ( in the first two of these every mile of it ) and , in the days of our wartime effort and vastly increased local traffic , came to regret the step bitterly . By moves of this sort , tremendous track and pavement maintenance costs were saved . In many American cities the oldtime trolley companies were required by their charters not only to maintain the pavement between their rails , but for a distance of two feet on either side which , in the case of a double-track line , came to a rather pretty figure .... In addition to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and operation of central stations to provide the power energy .... The trolley executives went at the abandonment of their rail lines with enthusiasm . They also began the purchase of  | attractive new buses with which to replace their trolley services , purchased them by the hundreds and by the thousands with a fine disregard for future gasoline and rubber supply . But , of course , up to that time there had been no Pearl Harbor . In a few instances there was an awakening from the dream . In the city of New York the Third Avenue Railroad Company ( an old but highly efficient transport organism as distinguished from some of its fellows in that metropolitan field , but , nonetheless , not in business for its health ) event into this new form of carrying with a full measure of enthusiasm . It ripped out many of its less profitable main stems and branches in the Bronx and in Westchester and saved much money in so doing . Then it tackled Manhattan Island . It abandoned one or two of the lightly-used lines on the far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harbor , it prepared to tackle one of its worst bottlenecks , Fifty-ninth Street , which leads straight across the most congested part of the city . It ordered fine , new buses to replace the ancient trolley cars on the short but busy route . Motorists and storekeepers along the street rejoiced . The Office of Defense Transportation in Washington did not . It already foresaw the coming rubber and gas crises . It ordered the crosstown trolleys retained in Fifty-ninth Street . This was done .... Other similar situations it has handled in the same way . The onetime Putnam and Halsey trolley line over in Brooklyn , completely abandoned more than a year ago , was returned to active service . Fortunately , the energetic LaGuardia in his unending search for metal scrap had not discovered its unused rails . Overhead wires were put in place again , and the day that the old line went back into service was made an occasion of rejoicing by the Old Brooklynites.  | The frantic Fiorella had done a thorough job , however , with the West Side elevated lines in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were torn down and sold as scrap metal ( it was said that much of this material went to the Japs ) and most of their cars stored in an elevated yard alongside the Harlem River just beyond the Polo Grounds . There they were forgotten children , until a few months ago when many of them were shipped across the continent to do their own part of the war job by transporting shipyard workers at Oakland and at Portland . Similarly , the far more modern electric cars of the recently abandoned suburban lines of the Southern Pacific out of San Francisco to the East Bay cities have been put to the same wartime task . There has been a good deal of well-warranted criticism of the use of individual automobiles by the workers in shipyard and other wartime plants . In one shipyard plant with 50,000 workers ninety-four per cent travel in this uneconomical fashion .... With my own eyes I have seen workmen coming back from a day 's task in one of our York State military camps ? a straight four hundred automobiles , old and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like Fifth Avenue traffic in the blessed old days ? and every one of them carrying but one passenger , the man who was driving the car . All the while there existed a parallel and perfectly usable branch railroad , which easily might have transported those workmen in one train from the job to the town ten miles away .... Even in wartime we are a wasteful nation . There has been some effort to get these workers together and so save cars and gas and rubber . Most of the higher-grade , gas-rationing coupon-books are issued on this theory . But it has not been a particularly successful effort . The trouble seems to be that in practice ofttimes it is unworkable . The workers either do not live closely enough together , or their hours of  | work do not jibe . There are problems of responsibility and of insurance that are not easily thrown off . The private automobile in wartime is a problem that is by no means easily solved . And yet that that same automobile is an essential to the wartime job , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life in the United States many hundreds of thousands of persons , living more or less remote from the communities in which they work and having no public modes of conveyance available , have become entirely dependent upon it at all seasons of the year . The modern automobile has changed completely not only the customs , but the very face of the land . No longer is the man of modest means compelled to live in the congestion and the heat of the city . The open country calls to him ; and he heeds the call by the tens and hundreds of thousands . Nowadays a large proportion of these folk have become war workers . Their demands and their necessities for personal . transport are not to be ignored , any more than those of the dirt farmer , living far apart from city or from town and having no direct contact with it , yet , with his own abundant acres doing his own real part toward the winning of this man 's war . They , too , are very much dependent upon their truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims our attention . It , too , in these piping times of war , has climbed with its traffic to sizable proportions . In February 1942 for the first time in his- tory more passengers rode in the motor coaches of the United States than in the railroad ones . The same thing was true in March 1942 . And this state of things has been pretty well maintained since then . Six billion passengers rode the motor buses in 1942 ... and this figure is apt to be exceeded in 1943 . The last actual figures of this sizable traffic are those of the calendar year , 1941 , when the number of buses in operation upon the highroads of the United States was not less than 146,280 . Of these , the number of public-carrier buses ( carrying revenue passengers ) was 57,580 ; the non-revenue buses ? practically all of these public-owned and carrying students and teachers to and from schools in city and country ? came to the sizable total of 45,250 . The revenue buses in 1941 carried 4,794,956,000 passengers ; the non-revenue ones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something over five and a half billion passengers . That is a figure to be well exceeded in 1942 and probably again in 1943 . The beginnings of this bus industry are interesting : It all began in a scattered , disorganized , and thoroughly amateurish fashion . If you got in at the beginning some thirty years ago , it took very little capital to start a bus line . If you were mechanically minded , you got hold of an old truck  | chassis somewhere and induced the local carpenter to help you build some sort of body for it , with windows and doors and seats ? sufficient protection against cold and rain and snow . The results frequently were weird contraptions , indeed ; but the idea , which had developed from carrying pay passengers in one 's own car , quickly caught popular favor . Buses multiplied both in number and in carrying capacity until the other public carriers began to feel their inroads , and moved to have them , like themselves , brought under the ken of the regulatory commissions . Presently this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of which had been built on a shoestring , were the first to feel the new competition . It was then the turn of the branch lines and the main stems of the steam railroads . In many cases they began to fold their services . There were fewer cars and fewer trains . In the latter case at least , as already has been intimated , the reductions came without much regret on the part of the railroads , many of whom were sick and tired of trying to maintain local passenger services at steadily decreasing revenues . The competition of the privately owned and operated automobile already had begun to show itself with deadly effect . From its crude beginnings the motor bus traffic swept rapidly into a real business of transport . No longer were the buses , themselves , the product of the ingenuity ? or the lack of it ? of the local carpenter . Men went into the business of manufacturing them . Capable designers went to work upon the bus . Even the problem of the design of its engine became a specialized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and elegance of the finest private automobiles.  | Frank Fagoel , who was one of the early designers and builders of this sort of highway craft , told me twenty years ago that by inducing the bus operators to discard just two of their twenty-eight or thirty seats ? which meant , of course , the loss of two potential fares , he could give them a vehicle as roomy as the average passenger coach then in use on the local trains of the railroads , and one far more comfortable and elegant . One that would attract in the long run many more passengers than the two lost ... and , finally , his idea prevailed . The modern motor coach upon the public highway became , if not a thing of beauty , at least a joy forever to its riders ( when they were not crowded too tightly into it ) . Most of the bus operators learned that it was not good business , especially in a sharply competitive field , to crowd passengers in that way . They even went so far as to introduce sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West once operated trolley sleepers . In studying the advance of transport across the land , I once rode one of these buses ? from Los Angeles to San Francisco ? and shall never quite forget the experience . Never before have I been so uncomfortable . Quite evidently , those sleeper buses were not designed for large men ? or for sleeping . When I next rode all night upon a bus ? and I have done it more than once , I preferred to ride in a comfortable reclining chair with most if not all of my clothes on , just as I infinitely prefer riding all night in one of these new , modern railroad coaches to an upper berth in the best of all the Pullman sleepers . The oldtime , individual operators gradually became less and less of the bus picture as consolidation followed consolidation and bus operation , like that of the truck , gradually became Big Business . The entire thing became well organized .... Instead of dirty , little terminals in the nearest , small  | hotel , drugstore or cigar-stand , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were marvels of completeness , of convenience , and of elegance .... The business had come to stay and it knew that it had come to stay . It steadily increased its appeal to the traveling public . For the moment its efforts toward expansion obviously are halted . It , too , is in khaki . Orders from the O.D.T. not merely limit speed , as in the case of private cars , to thirty-five miles an hour , but prohibit the operation of extra " sections " of buses for the regular , long-distance runs , for sight-seeing , for groups of college glee-clubs , of football teams or of their rooters ... any of these pleasant , extra-curricular activities of the times of peace . Not only are the conservation of rubber tires and of gasoline chief factors in these interdicts , but there is extreme need of preserving the life of the bus , itself . No one knows how quickly or how easily the existing ones can be replaced in case of breakdown or of hopeless obsolescence and old age . So their very existences are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being used , as far as possible , only for the most essential civilian uses , and in certain cases , for purely military ones . In one other very important way the automotive engine is making large contributions to the war effort . In the preceding chapter I have referred to the way that the railroads in Alaska are being bent to that effort .... It takes no deep understanding of the present war situation to realize the importance of close contact at this moment between the United States and its Alaskan possessions , and the strategic value of such contact .... The fact that ever since its purchase in 1867 , Alaska has remained fairly remote , has been a handicap . Until very recently there has been no railroad , no high- road , even of the crudest sort between that outlying possession and the United States . The only means of communication has been by ship ( very recently by air ) , and the fact that the passage between the two countries , past the west coast of Canada , has been a five-day voyage through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fog , has only added to the problems of traveling the difficult route from Seattle to Skagway or Seward .... From time to time there has been much talk of a railroad or a highroad ; but until war emergency dictated sharply , nothing was done . The further fact that any such connecting link would have to cross Canada for hundreds of miles did not help . The present war solved the problem . The invasion of the Aleutian Islands by the Japs drove the nail to its head . It became necessary to act and to act at once . As one of its emergency war activities , the Army took on the job . It placed it in charge of Colonel John W. Wheeler , who formerly was executive assistant to Ralph Budd , President of the Burling- ton system , and who is a construction engineer of experience . With an abundant force to aid him , Wheeler went to work . The Alaska Highway , or to call it by the more popular name already given it ? the Alcan ? ? is 1610 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dawson Creek , British Columbia , as well as from the long-existent head of the highway at Hazelton in the same province ( both of which represented the most northerly end of the vast continental system of railroad and highroad in North America ) to a short highway which leads into the important frontier town of Fairbanks , Alaska , upon the Yukon .... Starting from Dawson Creek in the Peace River region , it goes almost due north from Fort St. John to Fort Nelson ... then west toward Watson Lake and White Horse ? head of navigation upon the Yukon , where there is connection with the White Horse and Yukon Railroad . At Fairbanks there is a connection with the Alaska Railroad and with a short but growing system of local highways . These afford swift carriage to the sea for freight coming in over the new highway . The swift construction of this North American Burma Road represents almost a supreme achievement on the part of the Army . The road goes where no railroad could hope to go . It called for no vast amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high mountains and it ascends grades of as much as one foot in twelve ( later it is hoped to reduce the worst of these to a maximum of no more than nine per cent ) . The summit of the road is between Fort Nelson and  | Watson Lake , 4212 feet above the level of the sea . Bridges presented a special problem . The longest of them ? 2400 feet extends across Nisutlin Bay . But the one most difficult to construct was that over the White River , which has a curious reversed habit of freezing from the bottom up .... The muskeg as the sodden bogs peculiar to northwestern Canada are called ? was overcome easily by matting it down with felled spruce trees and then covering the entire construction with a thick bed of dirt and gravel . This provided a thoroughly solid foundation for the road . Most of the labor was done by civilian workmen , thousands of whom were employed on the job . Colonel Wheeler reports these men as being both loyal and steady . Few if any of them were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war task and go AWOL on prospecting expeditions .... On the other hand , the Army found it difficult to lure trappers and gold prospectors to its ranks . There was a something about their nomadic existence that appealed to them far more than ordinary hard work ? even at high wages . The first plans to build the Alaska Highway in the most obvious place ? close to the sea for most , if not all , of its length , quickly were discarded . The British Columbia coast offers no easy pathway for the road-builder . Much of the bank rises precipitately from the sea and at once becomes highly mountainous . While , a road , just inside the Coastal Range could far more easily be defended from invasion . The inside route was chosen , and opened for development a vast interior country .... The Alcan Highway has been built to a uniform width of twenty feet for its entire length . For the purposes of military use it is planned to divide it , like a railroad , into operating divisions , each approximately one hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set about thirty-five miles apart .  | The drivers of trucks and army motor cars as a rule will operate over but one division ? crews changing at the terminal points . The problem of handling constant and heavy traffic over a difficult road by men fairly unfamiliar with all of it is thus avoided . Each driver will know his own division , with which he is thoroughly familiar . Had time and materials permitted a railroad and not a highway , a railroad would have been built . But time and materials did not permit . A railroad would have hauled more munitions and other freight in swifter time and with a more economical use of fuel and manpower than the Alcan but it would have taken at least twice as long to build and 1300 miles of it would have required a tremendous amount of steel , not easy to obtain at just this moment . Yet , such a railroad already has been surveyed , both by the American Army and by private interests . The latter are not in a position at this moment to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is toying with it , although it probably will do nothing with it at the moment . It has other and far more important construction projects in mind . The Alcan , finished and opened for use November 20 , 1942 , meets all immediate needs .  | This railroad , connecting the existing system of railroads in the United States and Canada and three hundred miles shorter than the Alaska Highway , would run well to the west of it in the natural valley between the Canadian Rockies and the Coastal Range along the British Columbia shore . It would start at Prince George on the Canadian National 's line leading from Edmonton , Alberta to Prince Rupert on the Pacific , and run with easy grades through White Horse to Fairbanks 1300 miles . Someday it will be built . Someday a passenger standing in the terminal stations in Montreal or New York will be able to board a train running through without change to the Arctic Circle ? a matter of but five or six days at the longest . And some day , much sooner , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old car , shout blithely to his wife , " All packed up , Mother ? We start in fifteen minutes for Alaska ! " Has a sort of thrilling sound , has it not ? ... Yet the thing is possible at this very moment . To make it entirely practical we have only to reduce the grades of the Alcan Highway , give it a pavement , a sufficient supply of hotels and eating houses , gas stations and rest rooms ... and win this man 's war ... and one of the most magnificent drives in all the world will await the motorist . If he wishes to make the most of it , he can go well to the south of Mexico and drive , more or less closely following the Pacific rim , all the way to the Arctic Circle . Here will be a trip that all but transcends the imagination .  | uununnuuOI LO OIO Ii Y OUmnnuumumuun l l lllfll1 AND now we are fairly come to the field of aviation ? transport in its most dramatic form ? as it applies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of transport this youngest member of all may well be called the Glamor Girl . In almost very phase she is little less than entrancing . Within the past fifteen years she has done much to transform the entire economic progress of the world . In fighting mood she is tremendous . Amazonic . In battle action she is swift and unrelenting .... But in her gentler phases , in the pathways of the world 's commercial transport , she hardly is less fascinating . She began her active existence , for this corner of the world at least , on that memorable day in December 1903 , when Orville Wright first soared aloft above the rim of the sea where it beats against the white sands of North Carolina at a desolate place called Kitty Hawk . A lonely place , indeed ; and for that very reason it was chosen by the Wright brothers ? bicycle mechanics par excellence of Dayton , Ohio ? for their first experiments with a heavier-than-air flying machine . They did not wish to risk public failures , especially in the eyes of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched Samuel P. Langley 's dire defeat in the same field , an unsympathetic world that still rode the  | trains of Old Man Railroad as it toyed with a curious new form of horseless carriage , a gadget designed to ride at modest speed at least the better of the well-surfaced highroads . No intelligent person could ever expect better than twenty-five or thirty miles an hour of the automobile . But that was as good , or better , than most of the railroad trains at that time were achieving , the local ones at least . It was in October , 1903 , that Samuel Pierrepont Langley , having ridden into Washington ( by train ) in a good deal of a blaze of glory , made his first real attempt at flight with a heavier-than-air machine by catapulting from a platform on the banks of the Potomac almost within the shadow of the Capitol . He was a born scientist . For more than seven years at Meadville , Pennsylvania , where he was a member of the faculty of Alleghany College , he had carried on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using steam , then internal-combustion gas engines for his purpose . ... The device which he took to Washington hardly was more than a huge box-kite , equipped with a light gasoline Manley engine of five cylinder radial type . Its one and only ascent was a failure . Catapulted from a platform , it fouled its guy-wires in launching and literally flopped . It nearly cost the life of its inventor , who , thereafter , retired completely from the picture . At a later date , Glenn H. Curtiss took the machine up to Hammondsport , New York , and succeeded in flying it a short distance . Even Orville and Wilbur Wright accomplished little that historic day at Kitty Hawk . In the eyes of the world they  | gained nothing but public scorn . They were disgusted and immediately went overseas to France , the scientificallyminded France of those peaceful days , which was far more interested in the development of flying than was the smug United States of America . It was a long time before they returned . Another bicycle mechanic came into the picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the upper York State village of Hammondsport at the head of Keuka Lake . Curtiss had succeeded in gaining the ear of Alexander Graham Bell , the inventor of the telephone . He had enthused Bell with his ideas of practical aviation until the telephone inventor had advanced him $25,000 to return to Hammondsport and perfect a motor-driven flying machine .... So was born , in 1908 , the famous June Bug , pioneer among its sort . It was the automotive engine that made the June Bug , and every flying machine that followed upon its heels , a success . Without the internal-combustion engine , there would be no flying machines today . James Watt , who generally is accredited as having been the man who made the steam engine a practical possibility , expressed his regret that he could not have effected a more direct method of using combustion engine to create power than that of working it through water .... Steam engine experiments in aviation were worse than ludicrous . The weight of the engine , together with fuel and water , put it out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internal-combustion engine as their chief aid , Curtiss and his fellow workers , Augustus J. Post and G. P. Selfridge , proceeded to develop their next great aid ? the aeron-wing ? that device by which the wing-tips of a plane  | may be raised or lowered to any desired angle as the airship pursues her course ... the Wrights had tried to warp the wings of their earliest planes , but the thing quickly proved its impracticability . The aileron tip was the correct answer . As the forward or bogie-truck upon the locomotive was a solution to the problem of its constant derailments and therefore , a real step forward in its progress , so was the aileron a real step forward in the development of the airplane . Others were to follow in rapid succession . Steady was the improvement in the great and graceful man-made bird , not alone in its powerful engines but in the plane itself .... It was streamlined and then super-streamlined . Every tiny protuberance , even to a bolt-head , was removed . In the jargon of the trade , these all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biplane had inevitably given way to the monoplane type , they were cutting out as parasites the struts and guy-cables that connected the two parallel wings . The curious fact developed that from two-thirds to three-quarters of the " lift " of the plane ? the air vacuum developed as it goes through the air ? was on the upper side of the wing , not the lower . This figure varies in different types of planes . All these things , in themselves seemingly simple , took time to develop . Time and money . Wind tunnels in which model planes could be manipulated in all manner of air conditions , vexing and unstable as those in the heavens above , were studied , created and built . The very uncertainty of the air currents is one of the fascinations of flying a plane , as well as one of the things that call for eternal wit and vigilance and quick thought on the part of the pilot . Within a decade after its beginning the airplane business was in swift development , though still far from successful  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more wonderful things . In 1909 he flew a plane for the 140 miles down the Hudson from Albany to New York . He then prepared to move his swiftly expanding business first to Garden City , Long Island , and then to Buffalo , where , as Curtiss-Wright , it today is one of several plants doing a vast war manufacturing job .... In 1910 an airplane ( flown by Bleriot ) for the first time crossed the English Channel .... Already that strange , wealthy Brazilian , Santos Dumont , had been astounding the Parisians by soaring over their city . He kept his promise to fly over the Eiffel Tower by taking a young woman , after they had lunched , on the most astounding journey of her life . But his was a lighter-than-air machine , a sort of crude , pioneering dirigible , and that did not count , not at least , as did the heavier-than-air machines . By the beginning of the second decade of the present century , all the world was talking aviation . People not only talked of flying but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contraptions and spoke humorously of Darius Green . World War I broke on August 1 , 1914 . People already had begun to wonder what use , if any , the airplane could be in  | modern warfare . I had interviewed General Leonard Wood for the New York Herald in 1911 on the possible use of these new inventions ? the airplane and the radio ? in case the Battle of Waterloo were to be repeated in 1915 , just one hundred years after the original . Of course , it all was an absurd idea , just a newspaperman 's crazy idea for a Sunday special story . We all knew ? in 1911 ? that there would be no more battles at Waterloo or anywhere else in Europe . Absurd ... General Wood was not so sure . As Chief of Staff of the United States Army , he had been deploring the gross unpreparedness of the whole outfit . Not one colonel in the Army ? and very few of the generals ? had ever attended any of the great manoeuvres in Europe . Little or nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military leaders over there were doing . He gave me the entire picture that day . It all was pretty grim . The General and I agreed that if there should be a war over there again , the airplane might be extremely valuable for observation purposes . In 1911 that was a popular thought almost everywhere in this country , at least . But when war did come , in full time for the centenary of Waterloo , it was to be found that there was much more for the airplane to do than merely to spy upon the enemy and his actions . World War I found the airplane no longer a toy or an experiment . The one-time popular biplane already was passe ; the monoplane almost universal . The whole machine was assuming much of its present form . By 1917 it was a well developed and highly practical transport unit . Donald Douglas and John K. Northrup were very much in the picture . Henry Ford was backing the extremely ingenious W. B. Stout .  | It was Stout who designed and Ford who built the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northrup and Douglas who developed the monocoque , the fixed , metal propellors , the cellular wings , without sprats or struts or exposed wires . Remember that in the phrasing of the airplane world , all of these wind-catching , air-resisting things outside the surfaces of the planes are " parasites . " Whenever or wherever they can be removed , that must be done to improve the efficiency of the plane itself . Propellers , instead of being fixed , now were designed to be operated at various pitches for greater facility in handling the plane . No longer was the propellor shaft to be a mere extension of the engine shaft . It was found to be vastly more efficient to introduce gearing . The most efficient engines for air use revolve 2400 times to the minute ; the most efficient propellers , 1600 times . Oddly enough , the engines in your motor car revolve at a far higher speed than either of these . Douglas and Northrup developed the speed of the airplane , first from a hundred miles an hour to two hundred , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went along with them ; and today we speak very easily of four hundred miles an hour as a coming speed , not only in the stratosphere , so very high above our heads , but in much lower levels of the air . The entire question of propulsion is a difficult one . The pitching of the propellors was but a primary one in its solution .... Then arose quickly the question of the proper number of propellors . The single-propeller machine , with its blades squarely in front of its fuselage or body , was abandoned for commercial use , although it was continued for fighting ....  | Two propellers ... then three ... then four ... became the accepted style . Even six and eight of theirs set out along the wings were foreseen . But in the long run , two or four propellers , each , of course , with its own motor , seems to be pretty nearly the accepted standard for the airliner today . For obvious reasons , the engines and their propellers must be placed as near to the center of fuselage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made ? and accepted ? in driving one propeller in one direction and the other two or three in the other . By these days it seems to be axiomatic that the bigger the plane , the greater its efficiency . The larger the ship , the longer its range . Today when the average airplane passenger rides 716 miles ( 80 miles for the railroad passenger ) in about four hours of sustained flight , this is an increasingly important factor .... The normal time for the 2600-mile transcontinental run , New York to San Francisco , is but a fraction over fifteen  | hours , although this , upon special occasion , may be reduced by at least two hours . To the United States Post Office should go much of the credit for the development of commercial aviation in America . It was the mail that stimulated the Pony Express , and then quickened speed upon the railroad , bringing the historic , allwhite Fast Mail trains into existence ; and it was the mail , with its most helpful subsidies , that made regular aviation in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banker or merchant in San Francisco and other Far Western cities to keep in close touch with his affiliates in the East was the spur in the matter . The United States Post Office did the rest .... You can do many things rapidly by telegraph , by telephone , by radio , but by them you can not send a legal signature . . . or checks , or currency , or many other things vitally involved in the swift pace of modern business . The airmail solves this problem most effectively . It began as long ago as May 15 , 1918 , when an experimental service was inaugurated between New York , Philadelphia and Washington . Planes coming out of the Army at the end of World War I were added to the service . . . . Just one year later ? to the day ? mail took to the air between Chicago and Cleveland ; six weeks thereafter it was extended to New York . ... On May 15 , 1920 , mail by airplane was being flown from Chicago to Omaha . Three months later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the commercial airway linked the Atlantic and the Pacific .  | The first transcontinental airmail used a combination of train and plane . Passengers had the same combination available .... The Pennsylvania Railroad built an elaborate airport close to its track just west of Columbus , Ohio . You took a sleeper out to it from New York or Washington , transferred in the early morn to a waiting plane , were in Garden City , Kansas by night , into a sleeper on the Santa Fe for a second night 's train trip to Winslow , Arizona , into Los Angeles by the afternoon of the second day , and thought yourself a rather important traveler in so doing . The New York Central had something of a similar service between Chicago and Cleveland in connection ( at Linndale on the west side of Cleveland , close to the airport ) with its night trains to and from the East . In this way , several hours were saved over the through train trip between Chicago and New York . . . . For a time it was thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , high-speed , passenger service across the continent ; but after the air transport companies began developing their through , all-plane services , they fell into disuse . By 1930 they were abandoned . The story of the first day-and-night flight across the con- tinent is well worth telling at this point . I quote from a record of the trip made by the United Air Lines : " Just before dawn of February 22 , 1921 , a pilot headed East from San Francisco . After fighting bad weather to Reno , he turned the mail over to a pilot in a fresh plane . By nightfall the mail was in North Platte , Nebraska . Waiting for it there was Pilot Jack Knight . . . . Knight 's assignment was to fly the precious pouches to Omaha . Following the lights of bonfires set by public-spirited farmers , he reached that city shortly after midnight . There , tired and ready for a rest , he was dismayed to find that his relief pilot had been unable to reach Omaha from the East , due to bad weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days earlier , weary from the flight just completed and entirely unfamiliar with the route ahead either in daylight or in darkness , Knight knew , nevertheless , that the mail must go through . ' Waving aside objections from anxious officials , he took off into the blackness of the night . " They tell of how Jack picked his way from point to point , alternately studying a railroad map with his flashlight and peering through snow flurries at lights below . They tell of how he pinched himself and slapped his face to keep awake . " At Iowa City the demonstration flight almost ended when Knight , about out of gasoline and unable to locate a bonfire which was supposed to have been set for him , considered a forced landing in the darkness . At that juncture he espied a red flare a short distance from the city center . Knight landed near the marker to refuel and to shake the hand of a night watchman who had heard his engine and who had placed the guiding light on the airport . " From Iowa City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dawn . Other pilots took the mail on to New York . The first continuous day-and-night flight was ended successfully just 33 hours and 21 minutes after its start from San Francisco with  | the 2629 miles having been covered at an average flying speed of 104 miles an hour . " That flight more than repaid the time and the trouble that had been put into it . It spurred Congress into appropriations for continuing the airmail service as well as for lighting the airways . By 1923 lights were being installed upon the lonely Cheyenne-Chicago section of the route . In August of that year a daily schedule was flown for four days between New York and San Francisco to test the dependability of the route . On July 1 , 1924 , regular service across the continent was inaugurated . It has been continued ever since . What this service has meant to the Army in this man 's war , only the Army knows ? and it wo n't tell . . . . The Navy , all the departments of the government , would have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So would the makers of munitions and of the myriad parts that go to make munitions , the financiers , and the lawyers , who also come busily into the picture . The airmail is a most important part of the war effort and a most potent power toward the winning of the war . At the time of World War I there were no commercial lines of air transport in the United States . Today there are seventeen of them in domestic service , each of them organized very much as a modern railroad is organized , and each of them doing its very large part toward the winning of World War II .... As in the case of the bus on the highways ( and , before that , the railroad ) , there has been a steady process of consolidation . Not only have the planes been vastly improved in comfort and in mechanical excellence , but fine new city  | terminals have been built almost always at the expense of the municipalities that are being served . It makes the average railroad executive writhe when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at public expense ? and then realizes that , when a biggish American town wants a new railroad terminal , it is the railroad who builds and pays for it . When that biggish town gets hallucinations of grandeur , as did Los Angeles of late , and demands a monumental structure to match a civic center or something of that sort , the railroad generally pays through the nose . . . . But the airplane lines do not , as a rule , pay for their terminals save an extremely modest rental charge . It would have been hard for them , all together , to have financed anything like the $50,000,000 La Guardia Field in New York , which at the time that it was built ? 1939 ? cost more than the entire value of the commercial airplanes in toto in the United States . Will Rogers once defined a landing-field as an " open space , bounded by high-tension lines . " Captain Hugo Eckener , flying his beloved Graf Zeppelin around the world , and seeking to land it at the Los Angeles municipal field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the high-tension lines that surrounded that field .... Gradually , the situation is being bettered . The newer airports have fewer hazards surrounding them . The lanes for the take-off and for the landings are far longer . In some of the most modern ones , they are being planned to a maximum length of two miles . It has been a problem to keep these airports apace with the swift development of the size and speed of the plane itself , but gradually that problem is being solved . The difficult one that remains is that of location . The vast acreage required for one of these modern ports renders it all but impossible to bring them within easy distance of the centers of our largest cities . Perhaps when Igor Sikorsky per- fects that helicopter plane of his , it will be possible to roof over a very large building or a group of buildings in the heart of a really big city and make an airport of it . Such a possibility suggests itself in New York , where the great water terminals of the New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Seventysecond streets might easily be adapted to such a use and a black smudge on the edge of the island of Manhattan made into a thing of beauty as well as a thing of great practical use , just as that same railroad once wiped out its smoky , grimy , Park Avenue yards , and replaced them by the new Grand Central Terminal and , leading up to it , one of the handsomest residential streets in all the world . The lake fronts of Chicago and of Cleveland present similar possibilities . . . none of these for the departure of through , long-distance planes , but for the use of small taxi ones , ( possibly helicopters ) as soon as these come into being . There is one form of airplane that easily can approach the waterfront of such towns as happen to have an honest-to  - -  goodness waterfront . That is the amphibian . For some reason , there has not been much attention paid to the amphibian in recent years . If ever I get up my courage to ride upon a commercial airplane , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a flying boat or an amphibian , which can land equally well on land or on water . It would be a pleasant feeling to go from New York to Montreal , for instance , and to know that , if we were to take a tumble , we would land in the pleasant waters of the historic Hudson or the slightly less historic Lake Champlain , instead of upon the top of a rough Adirondack crag ....  | All of this is of the future . The airplane companies face a situation as of today ; and they face it most admirably under most trying conditions . The government requisitioned nearly fifty per cent of their 350 planes , and has demanded priority upon the others for its officers ? both military and civilian  - -  until the ordinary man , who is air-minded and who desires to go a considerable distance in the least possible time , never can be entirely sure of his accommodations . You are apt to board a plane from Chicago to San Francisco or Los Angeles and to be put off at some forlorn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there to kick your heels in the sunshine , the moonlight or the inky blackness before you can proceed upon your way . And it will do you no good to grouse about it . The airline people are politeness itself , but they are quite helpless in the matter . The standard airliner of today has seats for twenty-one passengers ; but do not be surprised if you peek into one of them , after being told that all its seats are sold for that flight , to find eight or ten of them empty . It is not the number of passengers that counts , but the weight of a vehicle and its freight . Assuming the plane to be able to carry some 25,000 pounds aloft in speed and in safety , you will , first of all , have to deduct some 17,000 pounds for the weight of the plane and its fuel ( gasoline will weigh about six pounds to the gallon ) . That leaves you 8000 pounds for cargo : crew , passengers , baggage , mail , express ; whatever it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? two pilots and a stewardess . Twenty-one passengers at an average of two hundred pounds each is 4200 pounds . The margin diminishes . It quickly is used  | up in the baggage , the mail and the express ; so frequently , more than used up that only a smaller number of passengers can be accepted . The deadline of total weight must never , under any circumstances , be exceeded even if seats are left empty and revenue for the flight reduced appreciably . Bearing no military markings and , of course , carrying no armament , some 175 twin-engined planes , flying the 45,000 miles of airway in the United States , today are doing a war transport job of highest importance . Not only as swift carriers , carrying the officers of the Army , the Navy , government officers , industrialists and others charged with the responsibility of speeding the wartime effort , but also with transporting the highly important airmail and air express . Sixteen years in existence , the air express in the United States now has come to represent a considerable volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modest 17,000 shipments , in 1942 this had come to over two million individual air-express shipments . The emergency value of this sort of service renders it all but indispensable in our present war situation . In earlier chapters of this book I have shown how , in emergency hours , the railroad and the motor truck have moved Heaven and Earth to meet special situations . The airplane in similar situations has proved itself equally elastic , if not more so . The instances of this are many : There was , for example , that job on a government dam near Denver , when a machine , vital to its prosecution , had broken down , and the only pinion-sleeve replacement part available was on the West Coast at Redding , California . The 540-pound  | part was shipped from Redding to Oakland airport by train .. . then made an overnight run of some 1200 miles by plane to Cheyenne . . . a truck took it on to the dam job ... and two hundred men , temporarily laid off , went back to work ... . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that war emergency . In more instances than one , mechanics hastily have ripped seats and fittings out of passenger planes to transform them into emergency freight ones . . . . A missing engine part flies from a factory at Hartford , Connecticut to an airplane assembly plant in Southern California . . . a shipment of photographic material goes overnight from Rochester to a waiting convoy in the harbor of Los Angeles . . . hospital supplies , medicines and even foodstuffs have demanded ? and received ? private planes of their own . All are war transport . Gradually a service of planes , exclusively cargo , has been developed . Its beginnings were in a cargo plane flown nightly between New York and Chicago . This was followed by " flying freight cars " in many other sections of the country . In November , 1942 , the United Air Lines began an all-cargo flight , leaving New York at midnight . . . Chicago at 5:05 each morning and running straight through to Salt Lake City , where it connects with the line 's combination passenger-andcargo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the volume of this traffic become ? particularly for wartime uses ? that the Army Air Forces recently developed a new Contract Air Corps Division to utilize the facilities of the fifteen domestic air lines and to deliver airplane parts , equipment and replacements throughout the entire Western Hemisphere . Already more than a hundred
