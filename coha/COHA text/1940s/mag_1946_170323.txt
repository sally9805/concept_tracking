Astronomers heard big news : Astro-Physicist Otto Struve and his staff at the University of Chicago 's Yerkes Observatory had perfected a powerful new spectrograph for photographing invisible infra-red radiations from the stars . Since the instrument can be used in broad daylight , stargazers can now go on a 24-hour shift . <P> Photographing infra-red ( heat ) rays is not new , but Professor Struve 's spectrograph is much more sensitive than any previously made . Using new red-sensitive plates developed during the war , and a gold-coated mirror ( which reflects infrared rays better than a silver-plated one ) , the instrument can catch rays of wavelengths twice as long as those visible to the naked eye . Its special advantage for daylight work is that , while visible light from the stars is scattered by the earth 's atmosphere , the longer infra-red rays get through with relatively little interference . <P> Among the Molecules . Astronomers get almost all of their information about the composition of stars from the spectrograph , which splits starlight into spectral lines each identifying a particular element or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story ; at least half of the sun 's radiation , for example , is in the invisible infrared . If astronomers could identify the material giving off these invisible radiations , they would know much more about the make-up of the universe . <P> They suspect that most of the infra-red radiations come from molecular compounds , rather than separate atoms . A star 's brightness varies with its temperature : the hotter the star , the bluer or whiter its light-just as a piece of heated iron first glows a dull red , becomes whiter as it gets hotter . At the temperature of a hot star ( 10,000 or more at the surface ) , all material is broken down into independent atoms . But there are outer layers of cooler molecules giving off only infra-red radiation . Professor Struve 's spectrograph , which can photograph invisible wavelengths of more than 10,000 Angstroms ( visual limit : 7,500 Angstroms ) , is designed to study these layers in stars and planets . <P> A Struve assistant , Dr. Gerhard Herzberg , who is one of the world 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exciting report to make : after a trial of the new spectrograph at MacDonald Observatory in Texas , he had discovered new bands of carbon dioxide in the spectrum of the planet Venus and methane in the spectrum of Jupiter . He plans , next winter , to study the faint planet Uranus , whose atmosphere is still a complete mystery to astronomers . Mars is also slated for early examination ; the spectrograph , by analyzing the planet 's atmosphere , may give astronomers some new leads to the old question of whether or not life on Mars is possible .
