AN AFGHAN 'S 4 FINE DOG , TOO A Story GEORGE FRAZIER O GGIE FLETCITER , sixteen , sat alone on a settee at the edge of the dance floor , idly fingering his chin to see if any of the pimples had disappeared . He had just decided that this party was a washout and that he should have gone To 52nd Street to dig Dizzy Gillespie instead of hanging around here listening to this icky bunch play " Chickery Chick . " He did n't know many of the people , the girls were drips , the band played too many sambas  --  all in all Oggie felt pretty indignant . And then he happened to glance across The dance floor . Bobbing his crew-cut head from side to side as people danced by and obscured his view , Oggie saw a blonde girl talking to two young men . She had big brown eyes and hair that Oggie liked to think of as taffy-colored . She was by far the prettiest girl he had seen all evening and he decided that he must meet her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oggie . She did n't look any too happy about the guys she was stuck with . There were several . ways to go about meeting her and Oggie proceeded to examine them . He could , of course , have one of the ushers introduce him . He thought about that a moment and then discarded it as being too obvious . The best way was always to find out in advance what a girl liked to talk about . Now , if this girl happened to be interested in be-bop music , for example , he could talk about Harry the Hipster and Dizz and maybe sing her the special lyric hehimself wrote to " Who Put the Benzedrine in Mrs. Murphy 's Ovaltine ? " But , on the other hand , if she turned out to be a square , that line would get him nowhere , It was a tough problem , Oggie realized , taking a handsome gold cigarette case from his pocket . He held the case on his palm and gazed admiringly at the Air Force insignia engraved on the face of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was a lieutenant colonel in the Air Force and Oggie was hoping his father would n't be looking for it tonight . He slid it back into his pocket . What in God 's name could he talk to the blonde girl about , he wondered . He sighed and glanced around the room again . Standing a few feet away studying the dancers was Frosty Ellis , who was two forms ahead of him at Middlesex . Oggie rose and sauntered over to him . %v iper 's the cry , Frosty ? " said Oggie , taking a post beside him . Frosty turned his head and glanced down at Oggie . " Hiya , " he said , and then turned to the dance floor again . Oggie dug his hands into his coat pockets and rocked back and forth on his heels . " Not much stuff here tonight , eh , fella ? " Frosty shrugged without turning to look at him . " Tough about Brooks Brothers , do n't you think ? " said Oggie . Frosty turned around . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " More rugged than that , fella . They sold the store . " " Oh . " Frosty turned away again . " Damn good store , fella . " " Uh-huh . " Frosty was watching a girl in the middle of the floor . Oggic pursed his lips and gingerly felt his chin to see if the pimples were still there . " Be a damned shame if they cut out the polo shirt , " he said . " What ? " Frosty looked at him again . " Be a damn shame if the new owners cut out the polo shirt . I 've worn nothing else for years . " " Oh , " said Frosty . " Oh , sure , it 'd be In awful shame . " He returned to watching the girl on the floor . " Say , fella , " said Oggie , after a considered pause . " Yeah ? " " You happen to know that doll over there ? " He nodded toward the blonde girl . " Where ? " Frosty stood on tiptoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking to the two guys ? " " That 's the one . " " I know her , " said Frosty , and sank back onto his heels . " Well , do n't be cozy , fella . What 's her name ? " " Joanie Wetmore . " Oggie pursed his lips and nodded sagely . " Spence ? " " Is there anyone here who is n't ? " Oggie chuckled knowingly . " Yeah , I guess you 're right about that , fella . " He paused . " Say , Frosty , what 's she like to talk about ? " " I never talked to her , " said Frosty , still following the girl on the dance floor with his eyes . " What I mean is , what 's she do ? She like to dig the boogie ? " " You got me there , " said Frosty . " What 's her family do ? " " Own the Wetmore Kennels . " Oggie grinned smugly . " Thanks , fella , " he said , and winked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dance floor until he came to the blonde girl and the two young men . He stopped and began grubbing through his pockets . The three of them stopped talking and looked at him . Oggie assumed an expression of shyness . " I wonder if any of you has a light ? " One of the young men cocked his head and deliberated . Then he began to go through his pockets looking for a match . " Hello , " said the blonde girl . The other young man eyed Oggie suspiciously and merely nodded . Oggie took the cigarette case from his pocket , snapped it open , and offered it to the girl . " Cigarette ? " " Oh , thank you , " she said , and gave him a big smile . She leaned forward , took a cigarette , and then noticed the insignia on the case . " That 's beautiful , " she said , feeling the insignia with her fingertip . " Were you in the Air Force ? " " Wel-11 , " said Oggie . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , and nodded as if she understood perfectly . " Oh ? " She laughed . " This is Archie Hopkins . " She nodded toward one of the young men . " And this is Billy Webster . " She nodded toward the other one . " I 'm Joan Wetmore . " " I 'm Ogden Fletcher , " said Oggie , and bowed slightly from the waist . " How do you do ? " " Hi , " said Archie Hopkins dryly . Billy Webster nodded coldly . " Do you sort of fly ? " said Joan Wetmore . " Wel-11 , " said Oggie , aware that Hopkins and Webster were watching him closely . He pursed his Iips . " Wel-11 -- sort of . " RCHIE HOPKINS found the matches he had been searching for and lighted Joan Wetmore 's cigarette and then , after a moment 's hesitation , Oggie 's . Oggie took a deep drag and began to cough . Joan Wetmore looked at him in alarm . " Are you all right ? Do n't you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , but the coughing prevented him from speaking . Finally he managed a wheezy " No , thanks . " When he had recovered he tapped his chest . " Gas , you know . " " Gas ! " said Archie Hopkins . " What kind of gas ? " Oggie smiled sadly . " I 'm afraid I ca n't tell you that , fella . It 's still security . Would n't want Russia to get hold of it , you know . " Joan Wetrnore 's big brown eyes were glistening . " How perfectly marvelous ! You must tell me about it . " Oggie shrugged deprecatingly . " It was nothing . I 'd rather talk about your dogs ! ' " My dogs ! " " Sure , " said Oggie . " Your dogs . " " Oh , " she said , and held her mouth open . " I 'm sort of a dog fancier myself , " said Oggie . " I got an old English sheepdog . " " You have ? " She did not sound impressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over their eyes ? " Archie Hopkins asked . " Why do n't people cut that hair away from their eyes ? " said Billy Webster . Oggie regarded him with mingled scorn and pity . " They go blind if that hair 's cut away . It protects them from briars . " " Briars ? " said Billy Webster . " What briars ? " " Why  --  why , the briars in the highlands , naturally , " said Oggie . " What highlands ? " " The Scottish highlands , fella . " " They 're certainly dumb-looking things , " said Billy . " You 'd be surprised , " said Oggie . " They 're pretty smart . This sheepdog of mine , for instance . I say , ' Gim me some skin , ' and darned if he does n't give me his paw . " " I saw a dog once who could count , " said Archie Hopkins . " Is that supposed to be terrific or something ? " said Billy Webster . " Once at the RKO in Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head . " I do n't approve of that . " " You do n't approve of what ? " said Billy . " Dogs on the stage , " said Oggie . " It 's cruelty . " " This dog at the RKO in Boston looked pretty happy to me , " said Billy . " You do n't know how he felt inside , " said Oggie . " They beat those dogs . " Archie Hopkins and Billy Webster looked at him doubtfully . " It 's an absolute fact , " said Oggie and glanced t Joan Wetmore for con firrnadon . She patted her mouth daintily with her palm and yawned . Oggie smiled at this , as if to let her know that he , too , found Webster and Hopkins complete bores . " I 'm happy to have my sheepdog just the way he is , " he went on . " I do n't want him going around wearing a derby and doing tricks . " " This dog at the RKO was n't wearing a derby , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheepdog 's pretty smart , " he said . " I doubt if he 's as smart as a springer spaniel , " said Archie Hopkins . Billy Webster 's eyebrows went up . " Grow up , for God 's sake , Archie , " he said . " Anyone knows the smartest dog is a beagle . " " I 'm not so sure about that . " " I 'm not so sure about it either , " said Oggie . " Oh , you 're not ? " said Billy . " Well , let me tell you , a beagle 's a pretty smart dog . " " Too smelly , " said Oggie , flicking the ash from his cigarette . " Smelly ! " Billy Webster was indignant . " A beagle 's not half as smelly as a sheepdog . " Oggie eyed him loftily . " You ever happen to own a sheepdog , fella ? " " I would n't have one of the things in the house . They ca n't even see where they 're going . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then smiled knowingly at Joan Wetmore . " A sheepdog has a terrific scent . " I Know a guy who says a wire-haired fox terrier is the smartest dog there is , " said Archie Hopkins . " Are you out of your mind ? " said Billy Webster . " This guy knew what he was talking about . He raised dogs all his life . " " Oh , come off it , Archie , " said Billy . " A wire-haired fox terrier is a good rat catcher , " said Archie . Oggie smiled . " We do n't have any rats at our house , " he said . " Listen , fella , I would n't take a wire-haired fox terrier if you gave me one for a present . " " Oh , you would n't , huh ? " said Archie . " That 's right , " said Oggie . " They get their hair all over the furniture . " ' Archie looked shocked . " Listen , what about your sheepdog , for God 's sake ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What 's that mean , it comes out in clumps ? " " You just pick it off the furniture in clumps . " " I used to have a Bedlington once , " said Billy Webster . " A Becllington 's a lap dog , " said Oggie . " If you 're thinking of buying a dog you ought to look into a St. Bernard . " " I 'm not buying a dog , " said Billy . " Well , if you ever are , " said Oggie . " Those the ones who carry brandy around their neck ? " said Archie Hopkins . Oggie nodded gravely . " Great dogs , St. Bemards . One of them saved my life once . " The others looked at him curiously . " Yup , " Oggie went on . " I lost my way in the Alps and this St. Bernard came along with this brandy and it saved my life . " " How 'd you find your way back ? " said Billy Webster . " Just followed Fritz . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's the name of this St. Bernard . He was a fine dog . " " You drink the brandy ? " said Billy Webster . " Naturally . " " How 'd it make you feel ? " " Made me feel fine . " Joan Wetmore drew her head back and looked at Oggie with interest . He smiled at her and began to rock back and forth on his heels . " You know , " said Archie thoughtfully , " I somehow like an Afghan . " Billy Webster nodded . " An Afghan 's a fine dog , too . " " An Afghan ! " said Oggie . " Yeah . An Afghan , " said Billy . Oggie shook his head sadly . " You just do n't know your dogs , fella . " " I suppose you do ? " Oggic smiled . " I 'm not the one to say , hut . there are those who respect my judgment . " MAGAZINE " What have you got against arm Afghan then ? " " Nothing personally , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ARCH and Billy glanced at each other . They had never given an Afghan 's brainpan much thought up to now . Billy decided to change the subject . " A Welsh terrier 's a fine dog , " he said . Oggie shrugged . " If you like a small dog . I 'm a big-dog man myself . " Archie Hopkins considered that a moment and then pursed his lips and nodded . " Yeah , " he said . " I guess I 'm a big-dog man myself . " " Say , " said Billy Webster suddenly . " I 'm not so sure an Afghan 's dumb . " Oggie smiled and nodded toward Joan Wetmore . " If there 's any doubt about it , you might ask Miss Wetmore , " he said . " She knows a little about dogs . " " Dogs , dogs , dogs ! " said Joan Wetmore savagely . " That 's all I hear at home . Mummy and Daddy talk about dogs from morning till night . I hate dogs ! " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You and your sheepdog ! " she said , glaring at him . " Why do n't you go home now and take him for a walk ? " She wheeled and walked briskly away . The three of them looked after her and then Archie Hopkins turned to the other two and began to scratch his head . " I do n't know about a sheepdog , " he said . " I do n't understand how they can see with all that hair in their eyes . " Oggie looked at him . " Damn sheepdogs ! " he said fiercely . " But you just said ? " Archie held out his hands helplessly . " I do n't care what I just said . I never had a dog in my life . I hate the damn things . " He turned and headed toward the coat room . Archie Hopkins and Billy Webster watched him and then glanced at each other . " Say , " said Billy after a moment . " Maybe he was gassed at that . "     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
