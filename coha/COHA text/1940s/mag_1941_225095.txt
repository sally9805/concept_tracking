For the first time in World War II-in spite of many earlier false reports-there was confirmation last week that one of the belligerents had used gas. * It came from pudgy-cheeked , moody Jack Belden of the International News Service , known as the ablest field correspondent assigned to the China war . Correspondent Belden likes to break away from his base and go off on long trips into the interior . He comes back with such stories as his classic accounts of the Chinese retreat in North China in 1937 and of the operational tactics of the New Fourth Army in 1939 . <P> Correspondent Belden , fresh from the central front , last week , verified Chinese claims that the Japanese used gas in the battle of Ichang four weeks ago ( TIME , Oct. 20 ) . The Japanese had denied it . Jack Belden had seen soldiers suffering from gas blisters as large as tennis balls , whose skin was turning black and red . <P> In the hills outside Ichang the Japanese had built strong defenses ; when the attacking Chinese finally broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flanks . One of the Chinese divisions participating in the attack reported gas casualties as high as one-third its total strength . Because the Japanese used gas , the Chinese evacuated the city quickly , leaving many victims behind . <P> Since they are a practical people , it will not be surprising if the Japanese , having found gas useful once , try it again the next time they tangle with the Chinese . <P> <P> * Last confirmed use : by the Italians in Ethiopia in 1936.
