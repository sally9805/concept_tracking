For the sentencing of Archbishop Aloysius Stepinac to 16 years on charges of helping terrorists and of forcing conversion of Serbs to Catholicism , the Holy See last week excommunicated " all those who have participated physically or morally " in this grave offense against the " liberty and dignity of one of the Church 's sacred pastors . " This clearly included Marshal ( Josip Broz ) Tito and most of his Government . <P> The excommunication , whose scope is without modern precedent , was performed by the Congregation of the Council ( Catholicism 's highest disciplinary authority ) , called into special session for the first time in 75 years . <P> Looking well and composed despite his expulsion from his father 's faith ( Tito has long since embraced another , worldlier one ) , * the Marshal last week granted to TIME Correspondent Robert Low a typically arrogant and mendacious Communist interview . Pacing the long , low-ceilinged study of his fashionable Belgrade residence ( he was in full marshal 's regalia , including gold-braided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freely . <P> On a possible collectivization of agriculture : " We will never collectivize . " <P> He blamed the recent " difficult period " in U.S.-Yugoslav relations entirely on the U.S. Said he : " Improvement does not depend on us . " <P> On opposition within Yugoslavia ( which Tito has ruthlessly suppressed ) : " We are not against any opposition movement which desires to assist in the reconstruction of the country . " But , added Tito indignantly , the present opposition actually " seeks to profit by the mistakes we make . " He made a grim prophecy : " I know the opposition will never become stronger , only weaker . " <P> <P> *Few , if any , important members of Tito 's Government regard themselves as Roman Catholics , but 37% of Yugoslavs are .
