Hugh Dalton , Labor 's shy new Chancellor of the Exchequer , had quite an audience . Present in the House of Commons were three distinguished predecessors : Winston Churchill , Sir John Anderson , Viscount Simon . Ex-cabbies and miners among the new Labor Members , many of them sitting on the floor of the overcrowded House , critically eyed their man . From the packed gallery peered the Bank of England 's Governor Lord Catto . To lords and cabbies , Hugh Dalton was about to open the new Socialist Government 's first budget . <P> In method , it was like any Tory budget . But its arithmetic was drastically different , not because socialists had written it but because Britain was at peace . Hugh Dalton achieved a miracle : he pleased almost everybody . To Britons , his budget brought a 10% cut in the standard income-tax rate , more deductions for wives , the abolition of a 33 1/3% tax on household goods . For business , the excess-profits tax was cut 32 1/2% . <P> To some 2,000,000 low-paid workers went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 2 75. ( $9.40 ) a week henceforth would pay no income tax at all . A man with a wife and five children could make up to 9 35. ( $36.60 ) a week before he must pay taxes . Said Dalton : " In the future it will pay to have five children . " But Britons in the middle brackets would still be paying higher income taxes than comparable Americans . <P> Usually rated diligent but dull , Hugh Dalton blushed when the House cheered him last week . Tories were relieved . Bankers beamed . Even Lord Catto , certain that his bank would soon be taken over by the new Government , was not shocked . Britain 's new budget was a good , middle-of-the-road job . Next day , prices rose on London 's stockmarket . <P> Americans had some right to feel puzzled . Britain was asking for a huge U.S. loan , complaining that she could not pay normal interest ( see INTERNATIONAL ) . Yet Britain could afford to lower her taxes . But the British were not trying to dupe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounds , and Britain 's world needs were reckoned in dollars . She needed foreign exchange for imports , foreign capital for reconversion and exports , and only U.S. dollars could fill the want . Nothing Hugh Dalton did to British taxes could provide the dollars .
