txt United States and British financial experts will skip the congratulations today on the first anniversary of their 33.750 million loan agreement . Great expectations raised on both sides of ' the Atlantic when the loan pact was signed a year ago have faded . Instead , there is disappOintment and foreboding . The credit is fast being used with no sign that it is fulfilling its intended purpose of getting Britain 's war-ravaged economy back on its feet . Moreover , England must now ado to her other burdens some important financial commitments under the loan for which a one-yea r deadline was set last July . This has been the subject of intensive secret negotiations in Washington the past week . The British held they could not comply with some details of the loan agreement . Treasury Secretary Snyder is expected to make an announcement either today or tomorrow as to what Britain will do about these phases of the accord . Of the $3,750 million credit extended to his majesty 's government on July 15 , 1946 , only $1,550 million remains . British fiscal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely IN be exhausted by next January 1 , certainly by early spring . The big credit was supposed to have lasted over a four-year reconstruction period . Marshall Program to the Rescue The proposal of Secretary of State Marshall for a general European recovery program , with aid from this country , came . just in time to save the labor government in London from the anguish of applying for another loan , according to diplomatic reports reaching Washington . Time and again during the past few months , high-ranking British officials were led up to the Idea of another loan request by aids who sought to nerve the Attlee regime for the jump . Both . Foreign Secretary Bevin and Chancellor of the Exchequer Hugh Denton were horrified at the prospect , But they had begun to face it somewhat unsteadily when Secretary Marshall made his June 4 speech at Harvard . The Marshall address was all that Mr. Bevin needed to turn sharply away again from the notion of another direct loan from the United States . He embraced the Marshall suggestions eagerly and has not since been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all Britain 's hopes for relief when the loan money runs out center in the cooperative European and American recovery effort . The Attlee government is understood to have no alternative plan involving additional American help in case the Marshall plan should fall through . Whether the Marshall proposal will put enough American dollars within Britain 's reach when the loan is exhausted remains an unanswered question . But the British apparently are putting their eggs in that basket , taking the view that if dollars are spent on European recovery a gocid par of them must eventually be corralled by British trade . Two Drains on Britain 's Dollars While the European talks forge ahead , the British have two principal drains on their dollar reservoir to worry about . Having accepted a 50-50 share of food costs in the Anglo-American occupied zone of Germany , the British have found that about 13% of their withdrawals against the U. S. dollar credit must be spent for that purpose . This expense was not even contemplated when the loan agreement was negotiated . British officials here believe that an effort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come . Secretary Marshall has already hinted that the request , when and If It comes , will get sympathetic consideration . Loan terms open another spillway from Britain 's dollar reserves , however . They require : 1 . Britain will make her currency " freely available " for current transactions . In other words , for trade deals from now on . England must offer those who sell her goods payment In whatever currency they demand . 2 . British dominions and other countries in the so-called sterling area are now permitted to spend any future sterling credits they may acquire wherever they desire . Previously their spending of such credits was limited to the sterling area . 3 . From now on any sterling repaid by Britain on her war debts to other countries may be exchanged on demand for dollars or any other foreign currency . See Big Demand for Dollars Although the agreement on " free convertibility " of sterling growing out of current transactions applies to all currencies , the world-wide need for American dollars is expected to bring heavy demands on the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world with lots of goods to sell . Some British officials describe this requirement of the loan agreement as " completely unrealistic . " They predict that within six months their government will no longer be able to comply with it . The British Information Service in Washington has just published a lengthy state . meat on the convertibility conditions which expresses a " hope " that Britain can make them work . But the statement recalls that " Britain accepted these obligations with some misgivings , " with " many people in Britain ' fearful that one year was too short a time in which to carry them out . Even more significantly , the British Information Service explans that a gradual relaxation of sterling restrictions during the peat six months was accomplished by a stepped-up rate of withdrawals on the loan . Britain 's failure to draw on the loan dur. ing last November and December was then ascribed to rising price levels here . When withdrawals totalled no more than $800 million for the first half year , it appeared that they could be kept to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when British officials approached the U. S. about a loan , they estimated that they 'd need anywhere from $5 to $6 billion to tide the country over until post-war reconstruction had been completed . The U. S. got busy paring this estimate down . Undersecretary of State Will Clayton and Fred Vinson , then Treasury Secretary . estimated Britain would spend : $1.5 billion during the first year . $1 billion over the next two-year period . The remaining $1,250 million was to . suffice for the following two or three years during which it was hoped Britain would achieve a balance of payments with the rest of the world . Withdrawals of $1.6 during the past six months were made as the British instituted a gradual relaxation of sterling restrictions in preparation for the July 15 deadline . The object was to reach agreements with British creditors that would reduce the $13 billion of sterling that Britain would other , wise have to repay on war accounts . Britain could hold the dollar demands of her own citizens to a minimum by controls ' on imports , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take ad-:vantage of the situation . Bilateral agreement . were rapidly pushed to completion ; some indebtedness was cancelled and some was funded for payment over extended periods . As this was done Britain set up a system of " transferable accounts " under which sterling become convertible into American dollars and the currency of other nations with whom agreements were worked out These countries included Argentina , Spain , Norway , Canada . Newfoundland and the Belgian . Dutch and Portuguese monetary areas . Czechoslovakia was brought into the arrangement . Negotiations are in progress with Denmark . Sweden and France . Talks with Uruguay and Brazil are nearly completed . Big Egyptian and Indian Accounts The Egyptian and Indian accounts were the largest however , and are the most difficult to settle because of political opposition in those countries to writing off the war debt .. The British have agreed to release a small proportion of the Egyptian holdings and are temporarily freezing the rest . The negotiations in Washington the past few days have turned on the question of what is to be done about countries with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India . China , and some of the eastern Europan countries now under Russian domination . The British have submitted a long memorandum to the Treasury here explaining why the sterling exchange restrictions will have to be temporarily retained in dealing with these countries , representing about 2% of British trade . The United States will make an official announcement covering the outcome of the discussions , and relating that the British will . in almost all respects , live up to their agreement on sterling exchange controls . For their part , the British plan no official statement . As one spokesman put It , " we 're just holding on to our seats and awaiting the worst . "
