COMPLETE POEMS OF ROBERT FROST 642 pp. ) - Holf ( $6 ) . <P> <P> Since Robert Frost is only 74 and sound as a hickory ax handle , this book is not likely to be his last . It does , however , contain his lifework up to the present , including several poems not printed in book form . And though this is not the sense intended , the title is correct about the poems : almost every one of them is complete as a work of art . Moreover , Frost is a complete poet , one of the few who ever stuck it out as such in a tough country for poets . Frost 's reputation has been secure for 35 years ; he is America 's most popular living poet of the first rank ; but only lately , and to the keenest readers , has he begun to seem as subtle , as haunting and hurting a poet as in truth he is . <P> The New England in which this slow man got his seasoning was the land of what Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forefather who had lost patience with his fate . " In 1906 , Frost had been farming for six years outside Deny , N.H. , and had begun to teach school . He showed his verse to his wife , who liked it but never praised it . Frost kept this up until 1912 , when he was 37 ; only then did he have enough money to buy passage to England for his family . As a poet he had no name whatever . <P> Robert Frost was 38 before he ever sat down with another poet to talk about poetry . That was in London ; the poet was Ezra Pound ; the poetry was Edwin Arlington Robinson 's " Miniver Cheevy . " " I remember , " Frost said many years later , " the pleasure with which Pound and I laughed over the fourth ' thought ' in <P> Miniver thought , and thought , and <P> thought , And thought about it . <P> Three ' thoughts ' would have been ' adequate , ' as the critical praise word then was . There would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left at three . The fourth made the intolerable touch of poetry . With the fourth , the fun began . " Few others but Frost would have seen and described the quality of true poetry as " intolerable " and " fun " at the same time . <P> For the Ages . Frost 's first two books , A Boy 's Witt and North of Boston , came out in England first ; published soon after in the U.S. , they had made him famous before his return in 1915 . They were masterly first books ; the poet 's own obscurity had delayed them until he was almost 40 , his early experience digested , his resolutions tempered , his vanity under control , his craft long practiced and well in hand . He had wrought and sweated to make himself intelligible , and had done it well enough by that time to know that the results would last . I shall be telling this with a sigh <P> Somewhere ages and ages hence : <P> Two roads diverged in a wood , and I-I took the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difference . <P> In dramatic monologues and dialogues Frost never improved on these early works . One of them , " The Generations of Men , " is as sad and lovely an American romance as anything of Hawthorne 's ; two others , " A Servant to Servants " and " Home Burial , " are as torturing records of the life of men with women as New England could provide . Frost went back to farming near Franconia , N.H. , and in 1924 won his first Pulitzer Prize with New Hampshire . After that the sturdy , deliberate man with the tousled head and bright blue eyes became a public figure .
