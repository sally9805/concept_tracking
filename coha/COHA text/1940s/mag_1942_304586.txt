The first mercy ship to carry food , medical supplies , cigarets and sweets to U.S. fighting men in Japanese prison camps is about to sail from San Francisco harbor , the neat Swedish freighter Kanangoora , fresh out of drydock with huge red crosses on her whitened sides . Into her hold will go $1,000,000 in supplies- and the love and prayers of thousands of wives , parents , sisters and sweethearts . <P> Sponsors : the 100-odd members of the San Francisco Press Club , helped by contributions from all over the nation . They started the project immediately after Army Colonel George S. Clarke gave the pressmen a vivid , moving description of the suffering of U.S. soldiers on the battlefields of Bataan.
