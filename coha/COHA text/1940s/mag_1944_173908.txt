The tempo of airborne blows against Japanese positions in the Pacific was quickening ; the weight of the blows was increasing . U.S. Army and Navy air forces were confidently advertising coming events . The Japs read the signs and proclaimed the obvious truth : new invasions were imminent . <P> Lieut . General George C. Kenney sent heavy bombers north to Palau , 560 miles east of Mindanao . They struck at noon with 90 tons of bombs . Simultaneously , fighter planes from Vice Admiral Marc A. ( " Pete " ) Mitscher 's Pacific Fleet carriers swept the islands in force , destroying ammunition and fuel dumps . There was not a Jap fighter in the air . Jap aircraft on the ground were fired . <P> Cut to the Bone . The same day , other carrier planes began a series of bombing and strafing strokes against Yap , 275 miles northeast of Palau , and Ulithi , an atoll 120 miles farther to the northeast . Yap 's cable and radio station ( a bone of U.S.-Japanese contention at Versailles ) was destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This once-proud capital of Nanyo , the Japs ' mandated island empire , adjoining the principal fleet base in the area , was shorn of sea or air defenses : the bombarding craft withdrew unscathed . Again , Navy planes added to the destruction . <P> Mitscher 's carriers , now operating as part of Admiral William F. ( " Bull " ) Halsey 's Third Fleet , bored in to the coast of Mindanao . In the first Navy assault on the southern Philippines , they bombed five airfields , destroyed 68 planes , and hunted Jap shipping in half-a-dozen of the big island 's mangrove-lined coves . They set afire 17 cargo ships , a patrol boat , 17 sampans . <P> But the most explosive action took place near Hinatuan Bay . There , dive bombers , Grumman fighters and torpedo bombers found a huge Jap convoy : 32 cargo ships and 20 sampans . When the planes were out of bombs and ammunition , cruisers and destroyers steamed among the madly scattering convoy and annihilated the remnants . Not a ship , not a sampan got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For Jap garrisons aground both in the Philippines and in the western Carolines , the only question was : " How long now ? "
