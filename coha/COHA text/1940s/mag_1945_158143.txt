Bastogne ( normal pop . 4,500 ) suddenly became important . If the left prong of the German offensive were to be slowed in its thrust toward the Meuse it would have to be done there , where the Lige-Arlon highway meets six other roads . <P> To Bastogne , soon after the German offensive began , hurried parts of two U.S. armored divisions-the 9th and 10th of Lieut . General George S. Patton 's Third Army . In speeding trucks came almost the full strength of the 101st Airborne Division , the " Screaming Eagle " paratroops and glidermen whose toughness and contempt fot danger are legendary . Back upon Bastogne fell straggling groups from U.S. outfits that had been chewed up . <P> The U.S. command had given one order : hold Bastogne at all costs . The Americans ( some 10,000 ) worked like devils to make some sort of defense . On a perimeter about two miles out of the town they set up a line of foxholes , manned by the 101st 's paratroopers . Stationed nearby were groups of tanks and tank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense circle , manned largely by the stragglers . Slight ( 5 ft. 8 in. , 135 lb. ) , salty Brigadier General Anthony Clement McAuliffe , the 101st 's acting commander charged with holding Bastogne , called them his " Team Snafu . " Inside the town was a reserve force of tanks and tank destroyers , to dash out against a major enemy attack . " Tony " McAuliffe called this force his " Fire Brigade . " <P> Bad Breaks . On Tuesday , Dec. 19 , the Germans rolled up from the east and collided with the American tanks , which had gone out to meet them at neighboring villages . A shuddering , small-scale battle developed and the Americans lost many a tank . But the Germans halted momentarily . Then the main weight of the enemy veered around the milling fight , probed at other entrances to Bastogne . Wherever the Germans poked there were Americans . The Germans kept on wheeling around the town , by the next day had it surrounded , a little island fortress in a swirling sea of gunfire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , radioed Bastogne for its positions . Replied Bastogne : " We 're the hole in the doughnut . " <P> On the first night one of the worst things that could befall an island of besieged happened to Bastogne : the Germans captured its complete surgical unit . Bastogne 's wounded would have to get along without amputations , without fracture splints , without skilled care at all . <P> Through Wednesday and Thursday Bastogne battled almost continuously on its perimeter , suffered tortures in the overcrowded town . Shells poured in from all sides . Some 3,000 civilians huddled in cellars with the wounded . Food was running low-the Germans had also captured a quartermaster unit . Ammunition was dwindling-an ordnance unit had been taken too . Gasoline was down to tricklets - the Fire Brigade , to save fuel , did not keep engines running , clanked off to hot spots on cold motors .
