While a U.S. baseball star pouted on a Florida beach because he did not consider $40,000 enough for one season 's harrowing toil , sports-loving Britain last week officially restricted three well-loved sports-horse racing , dog racing , boxing . Purpose : a closer approach to total war effort . Some U.S. citizens , impatient with Coordinators of Bowling and Horseshoe Heaving ( see p. 57 ) , thought the U.S. might well follow suit . <P> &gt; In Britain this year horse racing will be limited to 42 days of flat racing ( last prewar season : 331 ) and five race tracks , and horses will be permitted to race only in their own training areas . As compared to 5,500 at war 's outbreak , only around 1,250 British bangtails will be in training . In the good old days when the Derby was held at Epsom , some 200,000 railbirds would turn out : last year the Derby , moved to New Market , drew about 15,000 . At this year 's Derby , on June 13 , the turnout is sure to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just been reduced by half . ( Beginning July 1 , such rationing will be reduced to nothing . ) <P> &gt; There are 160 British dog tracks ( 17 in London ) , and going to greyhound races is almost as popular a British pastime as throwing darts or playing shove-ha'penny in a pub . Since the war there have been three or four dog races a week . Henceforth there will be but one , on Saturdays . In 1939 there were 12,000 dogs on the tracks , now there are 6,000 . Most of the retired dogs were not destroyed , but made into pets or put out to stud . Bidding is still keen for good dogs at sales , where a promising pup will fetch 300 to 400 guineas ( a guinea is currently worth $4.22 ) . A greyhound pup knocked down for 100 guineas is considered practically a selling plater . <P> &gt; Big boxing matches are banned entirely ; only small local fixtures are still permitted . <P> &gt; Football ( soccer ) matches-British equivalent in draw of U.S. professional baseball-are still well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground capacity on account of possible air raids . This season 's biggest match , England v. Scotland , will be played on April 18 at Glasgow , where the grounds can hold 150,000 . Last week the firemen of Bolton , Lancashire caused a minor scandal when they borrowed the National Fire Service tender to make a 278-mile round trip for a soccer game with the firemen of Dumfries , Scotland . <P> &gt; The Oval , one of London 's two great cricket grounds , is no longer used for cricketing ; but Lords , where the Oxford-Cambridge , Eton-Harrow matches were always played , is planning to open its season on May 2 with plenty of service matches and a few between schools . <P> &gt; Newest British sport , much indulged in by girls attached to the various fighting services , is Scramball , the maidenly counterpart of rugby , from which the scrum ( equivalent of U.S. football line play ) and tackling are eliminated . When a player with the ball is touched , she must part with it instantly . Stalwart damsels play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
