It looked like a magnificent mulatsdg. * In Budapest 's carnival-bright streets , workers danced the csdrdds and the rumba , while youngsters jitterbugged . In parks , tents had been set up for the distribution of goulash and other delicacies ; beer flowed as fast as it once did at Tammany picnics . Communist Boss Matyas Rakosi had ordered weeks of countrywide fun and frolic to get the voters into the proper mood for Hungary 's national elections . As in all such well-run Communist affairs , there was no opposition ; the communist " People 's Independence Front " presented a single list of candidates . <P> The Communists worked hard to get a " popular mandate " for their " People 's Front " government .

One morning 55 flower-decked trains brought 150,000 peasants . Special Organization Guards ( in blue shirts and red ties ) led them into the park , kept the applause going 15 minutes after Boss Rakosi himself arrived . A peasant woman kissed him on the cheek , presented him with a white lamb . Said she : " Anybody who is not going to vote for the People 's Front has no more brains than this little lamb .

Thus only " No " voters had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those who did could be carefully noted . By midafternoon , on election day , eligible voters who had not appeared at the polls found typewritten notes under their doors : " Dear voting citizen : We have established that you have not voted by 2 p.m .
