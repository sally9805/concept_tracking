THE WAY WEST ( 340 pp. ) -A . B. Guthrie Jr. - Sloane ( $3.50 ) . <P> Two years ago , at 46 , Montana-born Novelist Guthrie , a veteran Kentucky newspaperman ( Lexington Leader ) , proved in his first novel , The Big Sky , that an honest imagination edged with poetic understanding could rescue the trading and trapping mountain men of the West from the fake-heroic fictional mold into which they had long been cast . Now in The Way West , Guthrie has irrevocably separated the covered-wagon pioneers of the 1840s from the busy , lusty book jackets and movie posters which have long held them in box-office thrall . Guthrie 's humane and literate feat will have the mass of paying witnesses it deserves : The Way West , is the Book-of-the-Month Club 's October selection . <P> Testing Haul . This book , the second of a projected panel of four about the West , takes up where The Big Sky left off . Basically it is the familiar story of a wagon train moving west from Missouri to Oregon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be quick to appreciate . In all the body-torturing , spirit-testing haul from Independence to the Willamette , there is not one Indian attack , not a single war whoop or flaming arrow , not one hot-blooded , devil-may-care hero to turn in an impossible rescue , not even a big-breasted heartbreaker in low-cut linsey woolsey to take strong nation-makers from their plain wives and set them at each others ' throats . <P> Like most winners of the West , Guthrie 's Lije Evans would have been flabbergasted to learn that he was a hero . At 35 , he was a big , easygoing Missouri farmer with a plain , heavy wife and an ordinary , gangling 16-year-old son , both of whom he loved . Like thousands of others , he had an itch to do better , to own a piece of the free and . fabulously fertile territory of Oregon , where a man could get a fresh start and his son could hope to do better than his old man . Evans captained the " On-to-Oregon " pilgrims with common sense , native guts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely the most credible scout in U.S. fiction . <P> Yipping Coyotes . Guthrie , who now teaches writing at the University of Kentucky , has researched The Way West with impressive care . The speech of the time , the day-by-day ordeal of the people , the description of the land as it then looked , the realistic handling of Indians , will make even the closest student of the U.S. West applaud . <P> He is still not master of the novel and his characters have a foursquare , surface rightness rather than depth . He can also use some unashamed , sugary , overripe prose : " And it came on toward night , and the sun was down and the fire of its setting dead , and the coyotes were beginning to yip on the hills and the stars to light up , and there was the good smell of aspen smoke in his nose . " But most readers will be thankful for a fictional fidelity to time &; place that is wholly exceptional among Guthrie 's competitors .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
