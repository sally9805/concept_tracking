txt Leading representatives of the nation 's food industry warned yesterday that legitimate distribution of food throughout the country was threatened with " complete demoralization , " if not by " annihilation , " as a result of the Office of Price Administration 's new community dollar-and-cents ceilings and roll-back of prices . As the larger food chain operators voiced thar apprehension here , spokesmen for the smaller food stores hurried to Washington , seeking a solution for their own problems , which have been accentuated by the new ceilings . The smaller stores follow the lead of the larger food merchants to a great extent . A Warning to Farmers Meanwhile , Willard H. Allen , New Jersey State Secretary of Agriculture , pointing out that " a genuine physical danger * * * accompanies the introduction of criminal elements into food distribution , " asked : " Will ' strong arm ' methods of doing business follow ? " In a signed editorial in the current issue of Farm Service News , published by the New Jersey Department of Agriculture , Mr. Allen declared that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the black market situation , and soon . " He suggested that some farmers dealing with black markets " do not realize they are violating the law , " while " those who do understand the price ceilings and who still accept higher prices knowingly , have rationalized their action to their satisfaction . " The full impact of the new community ceilings and the roll-back of prices on meats became apparent to the food industry last Friday . At that time Price Administrator Prentiss M. Brown formalized a request he had made in a letter to the eleven major food chains that they retail meats at least 10 per cent below the dollarand-cents ceilings that went into effect last Monday . Chains Directly Affected The chains directly affected are the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company , Colonial Stores , First National Stores , the Food Fair , Kroger Grocery and Baking Company , American Stores , H. C. Bohack Company , Grand Union Company , Jewel Tea Company , Safeway Stores , Inc. , and the National Tea Company . A study of the order quickly convinced virtually every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved . When the A. &; P. received Mr. Brown 's letter , it was learned , the management replied in substance that it " would go along , " and in spite of all the hardships induced by point rationing , including a drop in volume caused by rationing , would bring its meat prices into line so as to come as close as possible , on the average , to the 10 per cent roll-back requested . Some members of the management of the A. &; P. are sure their reply must have been on Mr. Brown 's desk when he signed the order requiring the 10 per cent roll-back on meat prices . J. D. Kennedy , treasurer of the King Kullen Grocery Company , Inc. , operating a score of supermarkets , said there was no question of the demoralization of food distribution to be expected from the new ceilings and roll-back prices . He pointed out that the large chains already operated on small margins , that their volume had been greatly cut by rationing , and that wages and other operating costs had increased . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price roll-back threatens the entire food distribution system of the country with ruin , " M. M. Zimmerman , editor of Supermarket Merchandising , monthly publication , declared . " If the legitimate food men are thrown out of business , " Mr. Zimmerman added , " the country will see a flood of black marketing and illegitimate trafficking with food that will become completely uncontrollable . " Food men in every branch of the industry feel that the government has deliberately disregarded the fact that operation costs have increased alarmingly since price control went into effect . The terrific burden of constantly changing regulations which pour out almost daily from Washington , not to mention the added labor charges due to rationing and other war emergencies , has meant enormous increases in labor costs . " Against these tremendous expense increases you have the drastic reductions in volume , in some cases down to 50 per cent , due to the high point values placed on processed foods . This makes food retailing already a losing operation , even without the price rollback which will force merchants to sell their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that super-market operation is the most economical form of food retailing in this country . If it is feeling so drastically the stress of these roll-backs , you can imagine how many of the small merchants will have to fold ap . " As a sample of the distress calls he has received from all parts of the country , Mr. Zimmerman exhibited a telegram from Henry Schaffer , president of the New York State Chain Store Grocers Association , himself an operator of thirty super-markets . Mr. Schaffer wired : " If the Pricing Division of OPA is bent on crippling the retail distributing industry , it is well on the way with the dual weapons of shotgun prices plus radio programs based on the emotional theme of black markets , which tend in effect to undermine alike in the minds of consumers , the integrity of all dealers . " The continuing destructive pric. ing policy , combined with misleading radio programs , must result in having the consumer lose complete confidence in food distributors as a group . The food distributors are in the main keeping faith with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victims of this concerted effort . The industry does not deserve this treatment . " Other Protests Cited Percy A. Brown of Scranton , Pa. , owner of a super-market , wrote : " These new roll-back regulations to be enforced without the retailers having an opportunity of a hearing is a violation of the confidence and integrity of the public to purchase and the retailers ' rights to operate as long as no increased operating costs are added . High point values of rationed merchandise have shrunk retailers ' volume . Stamp programs have added increased cost and are burden enough to retailers . Roll-back on prices will affect the welfare of the entire retail food distribution system and cause a collapse of the food distribution industry in this country . The retailer and the public are as much interested in winning this war as any other industry , but the confusion and changes of the varying regulations are causing additional lack of confidence and cooperation . " Our understanding was that Senator Brown would submit to the Food Industry War Committee any changes . Therefore , we request immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discuss with them what they should be . Let 's have an understandable plan with American horse sense behind it . " Sam Schenker , president of Country Garden Market , Inc. , Arlington , Va. , protesting almost within the shadow of the National Capitol , said : " Emphatically protest reduced price policy as affecting life of our industry . From President Roosevelt 's own home-town area , H. C. Wheeler of the Lucky Food Market , Inc. in Poughkeepsie , wrote : " New price set-up for retail food markets will mean Class 4 stores like mine will be unable to keep operating . This is caused by OPA low margin set-up and our de-1 crease in volume caused by point rationing . Increased labor costs over a year , handling of ration stamps , and general lack of volume in our class store is based on our high-volume year , 1942 , which we ca n't hit this year . " Mr. Zimmerman had many other complaints and protests from super-market operators .               @ @ @ @ @ @
