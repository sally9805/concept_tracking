txt Henry J. Kaiser , west coast shipbuilder , today proposed turning nine of the na : tion 's shipyards over to production of giant aerial freighters . The proposal was made in a speech at the launching of the Harvey W. Scott , a Liberty ship . Kaiser said that in fleets of such flying ferries lies the answer to the growing submarine menace which is nurturing " a haunting fear " that movement of supplies and arms to our soldiers in many parts of the world will eventually be cut off . He said that altho Kaiser engineers have on their boards plans for air boats " beyond anything Jules Verne ever could have imagined , " having 200 and 500 ton capacity , capable of carrying up to 1,000 troops , the urgency of the moment demands that the submarine problem be solved at once . Losses Exceed Construction . Kaiser 's speech followed a warning by Rear Adm . Howard L. Vickery , vice chairman of the Maritime commission , that the united nations were losing ships faster than they could build them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on page 8 . Vickery said it is getting difficult to deliver building materials to the shipyards as rapidly as workers can construct ships . Ile said material available would supply only existing yards and that was the reason the commission yesterday canceled a contract with a New Orleans shipyard for 200 ships . blew Orleans begins fight to reinstate Maritime commission contract ' for shipyards . Details on page 8 . Example of the Mars . " There is already a flying ship which is very large compared with anything known to be in mass production , " Kaiser said . " I refer to the Glenn L. Martin ship known as the ' Mars '  --  a flying boat of 70 tons , capable of carrying a pay load of 14 tons . " That ship would carry 100 men fully equipped . Five thousand of them could land 500,000 equipped men in England in a single day . And the next day they could fly over again with 70,000 tons of fresh milk , beefsteak , sugar , and bombs . No submarine could shoot them down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such transport fleets can not be interfered with by , ? enemy fighters it they have even a minimum of protection . Our ferry service to Britain goes thru with hardly a loss . And such a gigantic ferry service as I see  --  headed to whatever part of the world our President and high command would deft ? nate  --  would be the safest method of mass travel ever ' used in wartime . " 1 5,000 Boats a Year . Kaiser suggested that the Maritime commission turn over three of Its west coast yards to the mass production of the flying boats , and do the same with three other yards on the ' gulf , and another three on the east coast . He expressed the opinion these nine yards in full production within ' 10 months could turn out these giant flying boats at the rate of 5,000 a year . " The Maritime commission has done a remarkable Job with sea ships , " said Kaiser . " It can do a still greater job with sky ships . Not only will this war be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won by them also  --  the greatest battle , thel battle that is coming with the peace . "
