In the short-grass country of southwest Oklahoma , the normal pattern of weather is a cruel one for farmers : too much rain at spring-planting time , drought in the growing season , rain again for the harvest . Year after year , cotton , maize and alfalfa crops have either been washed out by floods or ruinously parched . <P> This year 's weather was as bad as any since the Dust Bowl days of the ' 30s . No rain had fallen , to speak of , all summer . But last week , instead of gloom , there was jubilation in the short-grass country . A $12,000,000 federal reclamation project was formally opened , promising an end , at last , to floods and drought for 50,000 acres of prairie farmland . <P> At Altus ( pop . 8,593 ) , the seat of Jackson County , there were three days of festivities-a banquet , parades , fireworks . The big event was dedication of a new 100-ft. dam across the North Fork of the famed Red River . <P> On Dedication Day the temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd had was a few parasols and newspapers . Visiting bigwigs including Interior Secretary " Cap " Krug and Governor Roy Turner-were little better off under the sheet-iron roofing of their bunting-decked stand . <P> But to short-grass farmers , enduring the heat and two hours of speechmaking was no great price to pay for the spectacle before their eyes . Above the dam lay a turquoise lake . Below it , through a creek-bed ordinarily dry at this time of year , tumbled a stream of water , enough to feed 340 miles of irrigation canals and ditches . <P> What this water meant , the farmers had already learned . Last year , 510 acres on eleven farms were irrigated . Their average return , mainly from cotton , was $130 an acre , v. $22 an acre for non-irrigated land . This year , 3,200 acres on 60 farms have been irrigated . On these lands , cotton now stood five feet high and loaded with bolls . " On non-irrigated land , it was only two feet high and barely worth picking . <P> Secretary Krug voiced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rehabilitate the world could use more reclamation projects like the one at Altus.
