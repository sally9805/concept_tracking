THE Jagdschloss was hidden deep in the forest . Once the hunting lodge of a German millionaire , it was now an officers ' club of the Thirtieth Infantry , spacious and luxuriously furnished . Veterans of the famous Third Division welcomed us in the lounge , bar , and music room . An orchestra played " Oh , Vrhar a Beautiful Morning ! " Then the club officer , a young lieutenant who looked a little like Robert E. Sherwood , gave me a copy of " The Dogfaced Soldier , " song of the Fighting Third A USO pianist played it on the Bechstein and we all sang it . There was plenty of chaMpagne and cognac , the house was impressive and comfortable , the evening full of high animal spirits , friendly laughter . It was hard to believe that these men had been fighting in the Bulge six months ago , that war was still raging in this area only three months ago , that the nearby city of Kassel lay in utter ruins . The lieutenant who resembled Sherwood asked me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to show you how far away from a foxhole a man can get in this army . " We entered a vast , beautifully furnished apartment . The lieutenant went to a snliall table near the French windows , shoved aside his forty-five , and put out a bottle of Black and White and two glasscs " I 've never lived like this before , " he said . " What do you think of it ? " " Great , " I said . " Back home , " he said , " I was a salesman . I do n't know what I 'll do when I get out of the army , but I know I wo n't live like this " He showed me pictures of his pretty wife and six-year-old son whom he had not seen since the kid was four . " I like to sit here late at night , " he said , " and write them letters . " Then he swept his hand around the room and said , " You can have it . Just give me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't all live as elegantly as this lieutenant or as the young warrant officer from Brooklyn who runs the three best hotels in Paris for big brass I 've seen open-air camps where fifteen or twenty thousand troops lived under canvas and have eaten chow carelessly cooked and ladled out of huge aluminum cans into a precarious blueplate . Some soldiers take this philosophically . In the tent city outside Marburg one corporal said to me , " Everything is relative . Big tents are luxury compared to pup tents ; pup tents areluxury compared to foxholes . " Many G I. 's , however , resent the inequalities in army life . They particularly resent it in sections of Germany where their living conditions are inferior to those of many German prisoners of war and of Nazi big shots who have been allowed to retain their homes . Our army , like our civilian population , has its gradations of income , comfort , and status , but on any level the G. I. in Europe is a privileged character . He is sitting on top of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he has just finished off the most powerful army in Europe 's history . Against the background of a continent wrecked by fascism and war , whose people are for the most part sallow , undernourished , small , poorly dressed , and thoroughly frightened , G. I. Joe stands out for his youth , good looks , energy , robust health , easygoing humor , and immense generosity . He is the best-dressed man in Europe and the richest . A pack of cigarettes , a piece of five-cent chocolate , a cake of soap , gets him services even a black marketeer ca n't buy . Many officers live in first-class hotels requisitioned from the French or in palatial homes taken from German industrialists and Gauleiters . Enlisted men often have barracks and clubs that would do credit to any American community . Everywhere appreciative laughter greeted F. P. A. 's gag , " How are we going to get used to the rigors of civilian life ? " Europeans have the psychology of scarcity , Americans the psychology of plenty , and G. I. Joe has all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly every man in the army wants to go home toot sweet , and that gives him another distinction in Europe . I ran into Poles who did not want to go back to Poland , Rumanians who did not want to go back to Rumania , and Russians who did not want to go back to Russia . The only one who invariably wants to go back to his own country is G. I. Joe This is his central urge ; it decides his gripes , amusements , and hopes . You notice this the moment you reach Paris . You have your own sentimental memories of the city , and as your jeep rattles in from Orley Field you are not a bit disappointed visually . It is all there , the marvelous capital that has enchanted many generations . But Henry , our driver , a young Jersey grocer with a good combat record , warned us : " Hope 428 The NATION you brought plenty of soap and towels . You wo n't be able to get anything except in PX . Them Frogs have nothing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gather at 6 a. m. in the Etoile to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the liberation movement , Henry said , " They 're going to parade again . There 's nothing them Frogs love better than a parade . They 'd rather parade than eat . " You are surprised the first time you hear this gripe . Then you reach the point where you are surprised if a G. I. says a good word for France . With some exceptions the G. I. is lonely in Paris . For a while it is all a great adventure , the thing he dreamed of in his foxhole . He goes to the Louvre , Notre Dame , the Bois ; stares at the inscriptions on the Arc de Triomphe ; strolls along the Left Bank ; visits Gertrude Stein and Picasso . He picks up girls in the Pigalle , which he calls Pig Alley ; makes money selling watches and cameras to the French ; buys Chanel No. 5 and Schiaparelli for someone back home ; sees the Folies Berg  --  res ; gets drunk in the Lido . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes a time when Joe stops whistling after the girls and resents it when they ask him for money right off the bat and plenty of it . He is sore about paying $1.25 for a small slug of inferior cognac or sour wine , especially since he knows the French get it for 20 francs . He hates to be gypped ; he is bored . The letdown from the exciting period of combat is terrific , and Paris ca n't make up for it . I 've seen G. L 's wandering in the streets at night alone or an couples singing high-school songs or lying by the dozens on their backs in the Place de la Concorde , right out in the street , smoking in silence , looking up at the sky and thinking of home . This nostalgia finds relief in criticizing the French . The women are no beauties ; the men are rude and lazy , they wo n't work , they are not rebuilding the country . Every trifle is exaggerated , and the French do not help matters by their attitude . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You are not needed here ; why do n't you go home ? " They complain that our soldiers are boisterous , get drunk in the streets , make no distinction between one kind of woman and another , calling after anything in skirts , and buy up things which are scarce in France . The G. I. knows chiefly the street girl and the shopkeeper . He rarely sees real French life , which is in the home . He thinks the French are ungrateful after that marvelous day of liberation when they kissed and embraced him . When they tell him to go home , he says : " Okay , brother , just fix it for me . " The upshot of these petty conflicts is a disquieting paradox . The G. I. does not like our allies , and he has a growing admiration for the people he was fighting a few months ago . It was in France that I first heard an American soldier praising the Germans : " Them Krauts are rebuilding their country . Boy , they know how to work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's enthusiasm for German women . We heard it for the first time from Roger , the pfc. who drove us in a jeep to Reims . He was a tall , blond , gangly boy of twenty-four from the deep South . He had lost an eye in combat , and his arms and legs were wired where German shrapnel had shattered the nerves But he was a cheerful wag who talked about himself with great humor . He was crazy about his family back home , and talked a lotabout them , too . Then he got off on his adventures with European women . In France , he said , the boys put up with street girls because what else can they do , but if you want to see real nice dames , go to Germany . They 're beautiful , beau-ti-ful , he said , and told us about the girl who had been his " wife " in Germany . " See these pants ? " he said . " She sewed that permanent crease in them . It 'll last forever . She sewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what I mean . Once they put me in the guardhouse for sassing an officer . This girl heard I was on bread and water . " He laughed . " I was , too . So one night she comes around to the clink and brings me a chicken I used to tell her about Southern fried chicken , and I 'll be a son of a gun if she did n't make it for me . The M. P. 's would n't let her into the guardhouse , but their eyes popped . They brought that chicken in to me themselves and you ai n't kiddin ' , it was good . What a dame ! " General Eisenhower 's ban on fraternization was still on when we reached Augsburg the first week of July . It prohibited " visiting German homes ; drinking with Germans ; shaking hands with them ; playing games or sports with them ; giving or accepting gifts ; attending German dances or other social events , accompanying Germans on the streets , in theaters , taverns , hotels , or elsewhere except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially on politics or the future of Germany . " In most respects the ban was adhered to . There was no difficulty about that . The Germans were not fraternizing with us . You walked along the streets of Augsburg surveying the damage our bombs had done , and streams of Germans passed you looking straight ahead in grim silence . That was typical of the United States zone . But in regard to women the ban was a flop . Venus always follows Mars , and the Frkuleins were as the G. I. 's had described them  --  the healthiest , best-looking , most attractive girls in ETO and the best-dressed , too . In Paris you rarely saw women with stockings ; in Germany you rarely saw women without them . It was no use telling Joe that these women were well fed and well dressed because Germany had robbed all Europe for them . Joe wanted companionship , and the Frauleins were lonely , too . Five million German men have been killed in battle , millions of others are caged P. W. 's . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe likes it . They have a sense of humor . Laughing , they slap their backsides and say , " Verboten ! " They do not ask for money . They do it only for their friends , and they have n't an enemy in the world . So the G. L 's violated the fraternization ban , sneaking off with Frauleins into the woods or their homes . Going with German girls like that was scarcely an act of friendship toward the beaten foe . The most crushing humiliation that can be inflicted on men is to take away their women . Sometimes conquering soldiers take the enemy 's women by force . G. I. Joe likes to make friends and influence women by the charm of his personality and his PX rations . Some officers acquired steady sweethearts among the German women . The Joes picked them up in the street . When you pick up girls in the street you are likely to encounter little bugs known as gonococci and spirochaetae pallidae . October 27 , 1945 It is now no secret that these had a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G. I ' s and the Germans . There was a $65 penalty for fraternizing . The idea was to fine Joe so heavily that he would stay away from the women . What he did Was to stay away from the prophylactic station . In the army the word fraternization came to mean sex . The grapevine quoted a three-star general to the effect that cohabitation without conversation is not fraternization . The boys called 117as tst los ? ? the opening phrase of a flirtation  --  the $65 question . The result was an alarming rise in the venereal-disease rate . The ban on fraternization had to be lifted . At first Americans were allowed to associate with Germans only in public places . Now they may visit them in their homes , too . This solved one problem by creating two others . In general , G. I. 's are not politically minded . When they heard we had just arrived from the states , they asked about the cigarette , meat , and gasoline shortage ; whether it was hot when we left , what movies were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They showed no interest in the British elections , the Truman Administration , or Germany 's future . The questions they asked everybody all the time were : When do you think the Pacific war will be over , and when do you think we 'll go home ? The way they were put , in the intention behind them , these were personal , not political questions . They revealed that G. I. Joe , the world 's best soldier , hates war and does n't care much for army life . They revealed , too , the power of the silver cord , what Philip Wylie once called the " pull of Mom , " the longing to get back to Main Street and stay there . But it was more than that . It429 was a recoil from Europe as the scene of slaughter , a longing for America , which was remembered and idealized as a place of peace , plenty , and freedom . In any event , was n't Joe drifting back into a state of mind whose political expression is isolationism ? And now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't he be a sucker for Nazi propaganda ? The danger was all the greater since the army made no serious effort to teach him what the basic conflicts in the modern world were about . I was still in Augsburg when the fraternization ban was lifted . The immediate effect was interesting . People who the day before had passed us on the street in resentful silence now looked for an excuse to talk to us . An elderly woman , seeing me standing near an army car , asked if I could drive her to her mother thirty miles away . A fifteenyear-old boy wanted to know where the American Gestapo was . Gestapo means state police , and he was looking for our M. P. 's . The G. L 's came out into the open with their Frkuleins . They complained humorously that this took all the fun out of it , but whenever necessary they reported to the Pro station . A few refused to have anything to do with the Germans even after there was no rule against it . They said that Germans are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead German , that nothing can change their lust for world dominion , that they would start another war as soon as possible . But for the most part our soldiers were friendly to the Germans they met . They made a very clear distinction , however  --  at least this summer  --  between taking out German girls and taking in German ideas . This is the first of two ao tides on the G. I. in Europe. )
