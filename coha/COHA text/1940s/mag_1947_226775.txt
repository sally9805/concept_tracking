Says a Russian proverb : " A fish could sing a song if it had a voice . " Last week , Russian fish ( along with U.S. potatoes ) told a story of Russia , Germany and peace that explained what was really happening at the Moscow Conference . <P> Up from Astrakhan . Pravda issued a pronunciamento : " In 1947 , the prewar level of fish output must be exceeded , " and published a touching letter to Stalin from the fishery collective workers of caviar-famed Astrakhan , promising to catch hundreds of thousands more ponds of fish than provided by the Five-Year Plan . This was part of a full-blast Soviet campaign to make workers and farmers meet their 1947 quotas ahead of time , " to honor the 30th anniversary of the Great October Revolution . " For Russia was desperately short of consumer goods and dangerously short of food . Making the best of a bad spot , the Soviet Government played on the people 's acute wants to discredit the rich U.S. Recently , the Soviet press reported that the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine Krokodil shed some tears ( see cut ) . <P> Russian shortages explained Molotov 's relentless insistence , at the Foreign Ministers ' Conference , on huge reparations from German current production . But the reparations demands ran counter to the main Soviet goal for 1947-to capture German allegiance . At the conference table Molotov catered to German nationalism by prating of German " unity . " But what two Russian generals recently said about German unity in Berlin was far more interesting than Molotov 's Moscow rhetoric . During a private meeting with German Communists , Lieut . Generals Makarov and Georgiefi declared : <P> " It is necessary to emphasize again and again German unity ... a popular theme on which to work . ... All activities of the U.S. and Great Britain in western Germany opposed to our interests must be attacked continuously as undemocratic interference . . . . " <P> Man Without a Heart . In Moscow , Molotov followed essentially the same line when the question of the Saar came up last week . The U.S. and Britain favored its economic annexation by France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not directly reject the suggestion , but , even more mindful of his German comrades , he sidestepped , and soon the diplomats were discussing the huge Russian reparations demands . That was where everyone had come in . Cried Andrei Vishinsky at a press conference : " A treaty without adequate reparations is like a man without a heart . "
