The Wais Not Over for Them By MILTON LEHMAN VERLOOKING New York 's Harlem River stands the Bronx Veterans ' Administration Hospital , as self-contained as an island fortress . Behind its iron-grilled gate and inside its gray stone buildings , the sound of the city is muted and time goes backward to Saipan and Anzio , to Okinawa and the Battle of the Bulge . Outside , on Kingabridge Road , the war has been over more than two years and the newsboy hawks his papers , shouting the events of 1948 . But inside the hospital , World War II is still going on , and it wo n't , be over for a long time . In the orthopedic ward , after breakfast , the amputees come into the hall on canes and crutches for their morning cigarettes . Usually , they just sit talking quietly , like cracker-barrel philosophers in a country store . But on a recent Monday morning when I was paying a visit , they were angrily debating a radio broadcast by Walter Winchell . They had tuned in Winchell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his fire-eating sermon advising America to prepare for another war . " They 're after us again , " said a veteran of German butterfly bombs in Tunisia . " They wo n't let us alone , " said a pale young man with one arm . A gray-haired veteran in a wheel chair was trying to calm them . " Take it easy , boys ! " he said gently . " Relax and take it easy ! You 're not going any-where ! " The Bronx hospital is the largest on the East Coast and one of the largest of the nation 's 126 hospitals for veterans . Of its 1500 patients , most are recent arrivals , men who were injured or taken sick after World War II and whose hospital care is provided by Congress . The rest are the victims of combat  --  theblind and disfigured , the psychiatric , amputated and paralyzed results of war . A veteran , visiting the hospital , senses that he 's i been here before . On the first floor , the Gray Ladies of the Red Cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their trips to the ward &; Down the hall , the chaplains , veterans themsel are counseling patients with the bluff good will fellow survivors . Next door , the Special Services Officer is earnestly editing The Bronx Cheer , 050 hospital 's weekly mimeographed newspaper . In the ward rooms , the patients wear familiar colors  --  blue denim uniforms when they 're sitting up , brown blankets when they 're lying in bed . Their white-enameled cots are spaced with the ordered precision of cots in an Army barracks , and above the cots are bright pill-up pictures clipped from the magnzines . Twit  --  e a week , the hospital manager visits the wards , A retired brigadier general , he enters , erect and square-jawed , like a commander reviewing his troops . " Yea , sir , " the patients automatically reply . " Everything 's tine , sir , " For most of America 's 14,000,000 veterans , the war is already ancient history . By now , we 've misplaced our discharge buttons , along with our chevrons and serial numbers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wives remind us they 've heard all that before . But the men in the hospital still reminisce , despite all efforts to divert them , and often count time from the day of battle that landed them here . Young Willis McDonnell , of Rochester , New York , is waiting for the plastic surgeons to remodel his face to accommodate an artificial eye . He still considers himself a SaarbrUcken man . " We were trying to clean out a house that morning , " he says , " when the shelling began . It was February 17 , 1945 , just before noon . " A veteran of the 3rd Division at Anzio introduces his next-bunk neighbor . " This is Al , " he declares . " Al 's from Ie Shima , same place as Ernie Pyle . " While the young men of the hospital still talk of battlegrounds , the oldest almost . never do . Today , the veterans of 1918 feel slightly crowded out of the picture by World War II . Gray-haired and weary , they rarely speak of Soissons or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dated and unimpressive to the men from Guadalcanal . " They keep calling me ' Pop , ' " complained an old first sergeant , hospitalized since World War I. Whatever their rank , service or particular conflict , the veterans are now divided by wards , not regiments . And each ward is a society of its own . In Ward 5-D , the amputees compare treatments , doctors and prosthetic appliances , or speculate on the mystery of why one can feel pain in a leg that is n't there . In the plastic-surgery ward , patients count operations and talk of " unveilings " ? when the bandages are removed from a new chin , a reshaped ear . The medical wards , now crowded with postwar ailments , still keep beds for such recurring battleground maladies as jaundice , malaria , dysentery and the rarer tropical diseases . Of all the hospital 's wards , 3-D is more a world in itself than the others . Its dozen rooms , fitted out for seventy patients , are weird jungles of surgical apparatus . Above the white cots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; beside them are glass bottles and jugs , leather and metal leg splints , foam-rubber cushionsand collapsible wheel chairs . The men in the cots are paraplegics , their spinal cords severed , their bodies paralyzed from the waist down . Soon after the war , when the first paraplegics arrived on Kingshridge Road , ort hopedistn , surgeons and X-ray experts came to at udy them . They were the miracle men of combat , the doctors declared . Their type of injury caused innumerable complications : ulcerous bed sores , provoked by lying too long in one position ; loss of bowel , genital and kidney control ; spastic cramps in legs that had lost , contact with the brain . Sulfanilamide , penicillin and constant care preserved them , said the doctors . In World War I , none of them would have lived . The paraplegics , unlike other wounded veterans , can stay at the hospital as long as they like . They are entitled by act of Congress to spend their lives in Ward 3-D , and many are n't planning to leave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was paralyzed on November 9 , 1942 . Bermis has never gone home . Before the war , he lived in Phoenixville , Pennsylvania , and worked on an assembly line for a tire-manufacturing company . Seizing the steel handgrip above his head , he shifted his position in bed and lighted a cigarette . " Maybe sometime I 'll go home , " he said , " but not yet . " Bermis was hit on the second night of the North African invasion , near Oran , Algeria . " I was a curiosity then , " he remembers sourly . " I was the first of my kind , and I figured I was done for . Well , " he went on , reverting to the old story he had often repeated , " I was a private first class in the First Infantry Division . We 'd just come up from the beaches and we were headed for Oran . Everything was wild then and too dark to see much , except the machine-gun tracers , and we could n't tell whose they were . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I knew it was a sniper got me . " Bermis shifted again in bed , his spastic legs twitching . " The first thing I did was try to crawl , " be went on slowly , spacing the words , " and that 's what scared me . My fingers would n't grip the ground , and all of a sudden I felt numb all over . After that , I do n't remember much , except the doctors shaking their heads , and lots of hospitals and ambulances , and finally coming up here to Three-D . " He paused . This was the end of his story . " Hell , " he said , " it 's not so bad here . " Paralysis from the waist down has brought its special privileges . The patients receive the highest pensions awarded enlisted men ? $360 a month for total disability . In the hospital parking lot are their private , hand-operated automobiles , provided free PHOTOGRAPHY BY OLLIE ATKINS . by the Government to those who can drive them . For John Bermis and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ward has its own weekly newspaper , The Paraplegia News , which is printed , not mimeographed Like the plebeian Bronx Cheer . This spring , Ward 3-D 's softball team , trained to field , bat and run bases in wheel chairs , will resume its annual Silver Trophy contest with the paraplegics of Halloran Hospital on Staten Island . Last fall , the Bronx won the loving cup by beating Halloran 13-12 in a close match that nearly had the players falling out of their chairs . On Monday evenings , Ward 3-D assembles for the weekly meeting of the Bronx chapter of the Paralyzed Veterans Association . " We 've got the most exclusive veterans ' society in America , " says Whitey Sikora , who worked for a New York power company before he was paralyzed on Okinawa . At these fraternal gatherings , the men discuss paraplegia treatments , pensions and prospects for living away from the Bronx . Sometimes they call hack paraplegics who have left 3-D to tell them just how it is outside . Returning like old alumni , these visitors are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NOT OVER FOR THEM ( irapitiaacd from Page II ) are John Price and Harold Cavanagh , both New Yorkers , who left the hospital to enroll for journalism courses at Columbia University and to live in remodeled first-floor rooms on campus . While still in 3-D , lying on his cot , Cavanagh wrote a 300-page novel called Only the Wind Will Listen . He has n't found a publisher for it yet . Another visitor is Nat Newman , a former tobacco clerk in a Manhattan drugstore , who was shot in the spine on the Normandy beachhead while leading his squad . Now , with his wife Sylvia , he lives in a veterans ' - housing project on Sheepshead Bay , Long Island , and reports for work each morning at . the Bulova Watch School for the Handicapped , where he is learning to repair watches . In the evenings , the Newmans hold open house for his former wardmates , who drive out in their own cars , wheel themselves into the apartment and sit in their chairs drinking beer and playing blackjack . The doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wheel chair ; the mirror , medicine chest and shower faucet are all in lowered positions . Some of the paraplegics have tried to go home . Pete Buocavales and Arthur Coakley left Ward 3-D to live with their families for a while , but both have returned . Pete stayed away for a month in his father 's second-floor walk-up apartment in Newark , New Jersey . Barrel-chested and usually talkative , Pete did n't say much at the next meeting of the PVA . " It was tough on the folks ; I could n't get upstairs by myself , " was all he reported . Coakley'a three weeks in Brooklyn were no better . But after visiting the Newmans on Sheepshead Bay , he decided on one more experiment . When I saw him , Coakley and two fellow paraplegics were planning to move into a ground-floor apartment beside the New-mans , sharing the rent , the cost of food , furniture and a trained attendant . " We figure we 'd better get out of here , " Coakley told me , " before we lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strange world of the payehonew rot ic . Unlike the one-big-family feeling of Ward 3-D , here each man is a stranger to the other , fighting his solitary way through the shadowland of the war . At the bolted door of the ward , a guard stands duty , opening the door when the buzzer rings . Inside , in narrow cubicles , psychiatrists are talking to the men . At one of these cubicles , waiting his turn , was Paul . an ex-marine who had served in the Pacific . Three years ago he came home and was discharged . He held a job until one day , as he tells it , " a cloud came over me . " For months , Paul has been talking out the war to his doctor , trying to make it come clear in his mind . " I felt like I was acting in a play , " he told the doctor a while ago . " I was never afraid . I 'd go into action , but it was like somebody else was doing it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll do something terrible if I move . " Day after day , the twenty-eight year-old veteran has told his story , feeling like a sailor approaching an iceberg , fearing the danger below the surface . The doctor wants him to go easy , not to thaw out all at once . Paul talked to me of the war too . He talked of men killed around him in atrafings , bombings , machine-gun fire . He told how his squad was wiped out on Iwo Jima . He described a moonlight attack on the Japanese , and how be felt while blasting them down with his tommy gun . He talked about a woman he saw killed and how she looked lying in the rubble : He told about the minutes before H Hour . Paul is , in fact , living the war all over again . A few weeks ago , in a nightmare , he saw himself on a muddy hilltop walking through burning trees . It was his first dream in many years , he told the doctor . The doctor congratulated Paul on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a double life , walking the world of 1948 and reliving the old war inside him . Later , I met the chief psychiatrist , a short , mild little man , with bright eyes and a dusty mustache , named Doctor Flowers . Since 1922 , Dr. Hiland L. Flowers has served with the Veterans Administration , studying the mentally ( Continued an Page 3- I ) if : ern ' hi tied fr Pug , 52 ) sick of two world wars . " With these Lays , " he trthl me , " nothing you any of one is I rue of t he others . A few were errilrly hurl by the war . Others , like Paul , appeared to get through the war : ill right. , but had trouble after they got home . Some did n't see battle at hul , broke down in training camp . And I here are those who might have had trouble any time in their lives . The death of a parent , could do it , or a divorce , or the loss of a job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cautiously , " is that the war is often the last straw . It puts on the finishing I ouches . " In their ward rooms , these men lay on their hunks , smoking , talking , staring at the ceiling . There was Murphy  --  which is n't his name  --  whose war adventures read more like Sad Sack 's than Commando Kelly 's . A lean , bucktoothed boy from Perth Amboy , New Jersey , Murphy served out the war as a major 's orderly . For him , the war is the headquarters towns with strange names , which he constantly recites to visitors , " Tidworth , Oran , Constantine , Palermo , Naples , Marseilles . " There was Tony , a forty-year-old ex-radio operator on a B-24 bomber , whose plane went out of control over the English Channel . Of his crew , Tony alone escaped . There was Pat , a lanky redhead , who at twenty-three is an alumnus of a half-dozen Army and veterans ' hospitals . Shelled in the Ardennes offensive of 1949 , Pat came to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skull , unable to talk . I met Pat in the basement classroom where an instructor is teaching him to talk all over again . He was sitting at a grammar-school desk , watchingintently while the instructor opened a cardboard box . Inside the box were toy models from a child 's dollhouse  --  a miniature spoon , a fork , a bed , a table , a chair . " We 'll try them slowly today , " the instructor began , holding up the spoon , Pat cocked his head and studied the spoon , thinking hard . " That 's a  --  eh Oh , yeah , I know that ! It 's a spoon ! " he said triumphantly , exploding the last word . The instructor nodded and made a note . Then he held up the toy table . " Sure , " Pat said seriously , wrinkling his forehead , " I know . It 's a  --  hellit 's chair ! No , damn ! It 's  --  eh -- it 's a table ! " " It 's like teaching a child , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build up from the beginning . After all , Pat 's like a lot of the others . He 's still not over the war . But we 'll try to make him as complete as we can before he goes home . " The basement rooms are the last ports of call . Here the veterans come at . the end of surgery and medicine , Here the hospital makes its final effort to rebuild and repair . Down the hall from the speech instructor , where Pat takes his lessons , is Frank Eliscu 's quarters . IJliscu was trained in commercial art , not medicine , and he joined the staff to teach mechanical drawing . Instead , he learned a new kind of art and is now the hospital 's dean of tattooing . When the plastic surgeons have finished with their patients , the veterans come to Eliscu and his tattoo needle . Mixing his pigments carefully , he matches the skin grafted from abdomens and legs in remodeling an ear or rebuilding a nose with the color and texture of the patient 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work on a Negro veteran , who had been severely scarred in a Japanese Kamikaze raid . The Negro was now perfectly healed , but he seemed reluctant to leave the hospital . The scars on his face and arms were white , standing out like a tiger 's stripes against his dusky skin . " Folks 'll keep looking at me , " he told Eliscu as the tattooer was reaching for his dark pigments . When Eliscu had finished , the veteran admired himself in the mirror and then shook the art teacher 's hand . " You saved me , " he said , simply . Not far from Eliscu 's office is Anthony Aliverti , instructor of the blieSd . Mr. Aliverti , who is blind himself , teaches sightless veterans to read Braille , operate a typewriter , shave themselves and find their way , as well as they can , in a dark world . One of his students is a paratrooper named Bill Ferguson , who was blinded by shellfire shortly after his jump on Luzon , When Ferguson reached the Bronx , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tour of hospitals and convalescent homes . A former carpet salesman from Yonkers , Ferguson credits his wife and Mr. Aliverti for his new feeling of independence . " The important thing , " he told me , lighting his own cigarette , " is to take your inventory . You ca n't start over ( Cu , , ; ini , Prl on Pag , c .56 ) ( emititirteri ft Pow. , ; 1 ) ? until you know what you 've got left . " Like Mr. Aliverti , Ferguson die-approves of seeing-eye dogs for the blind . " They make you too depend-eel , " he says . " The blind man 's on the leash , instead of the dog . " Although he occasionally humps into I bingo in his travels , Ferguson still insists on finding his own way about by " spatial vision , " using a cane or the arm of his wife only in strange places . Spatial vision , according to Ferguson , is the blind man 's " feeling for distance " ? a fifth sense of space which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital understands the handicapped better than Dr. Arthur S. Abramson , chief of the physical-therapy department . A Canadian by birth , a former weight lifter and varsity wrestler at McGill University , Doctor Abramson served in France with an American evacuation hospital and expected to come home to a flourishing orthopedic practice . Instead , he lives in the Bronx hospital as a resident doctor , teaching paraplegic veterans to exercise their arms , to stand on their withered legs , to use their crutches and walk . Like his patients , the doctor 's chest is enormous , his arms powerful  --  and he , too , is paralyzed from the waist down . Until the Battle of the Bulge , where he helped his hospital retreat and was crippled by a German bullet , Doctor Abramson believed that paraplegics had little chance for survival . Now he helps them live by living himself . He is alternately gruff and tender as he tells them their chances . " Let 's go , Tommy , " he said , wheeling over to a boy on the parallel bars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure you feel dizzy . Sometimes I feel dizzy myself , and it 's a dizzy world . But come on , Tommy ; you 've got to walk ; you ca n't stay in bed forever . " Slowly , carefully , the young veteran inched his way along the bars , his forehead streaked with sweat . " That 's great , boy ! " the doctor was chanting . " That 's fine , Tommy ! That 's the spirit ! " At the end of the basement corridor are the hospital 's occupational workshops , where the legless ex-salesman and the paralyzed ex-truck driver may , if they like , learn pottery making , precision casting or watch repairing . Occupational therapy is still relatively new in the hospitals and its budget is limited . Many of the shops in the Bronx hospital are run by volunteers . The American Women 's Voluntary Services , for example , maintain the silk-screen-printing department , and members of the Advertising Women of New York , Inc. , conduct classes in preparing advertising copy . Next door to the advertising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing , drawing her students from all wards of the hospital . Mrs. Cusick , a former New York high-school English teacher , enthusiastically urges her students to put . their thoughts down on paper . Most of their thoughts go back to the war , grim confessionals in poetry and prose . " How do you know you ca n't write ? " she asks a bespectacled veteran in a wheel chair . " You have n't even tried . " With her encouragement , they have written poems , short stories , essays on life in a veterans ' hospital and their prehospital days . Here , in her classroom , Harold Cavanagh worked on his novel before enrolling for journalism at Columbia University . Another veteran , from the psychoneurotic ward , spends his hospital days preparing notes for a novel and planning to write radio scripts when he 's discharged . Much of the writing is symbolic , like the essay a paraplegic wrote after swatting a Ily on the wall with his newspaper . " The fly was n't dead , only maimed , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " Recently , a veteran brought Mrs. Cusick a short story called Last Flight to Valhalla , about a soldier who was taken , long after the war , to the eternity of dead heroes . Another has written 100 poems while lying on his hospital cot  --  long , sensitive efforts expressing his thoughts . " He 's felt much better since he started to write , " Mrs. Cusick de-dared . She pointed to one veteran 's poem on her bulletin board : From soggy wounds a man is moaning , Cold rain rills the foxhole wall ; Death 's abroad with transit , zoning , And the canteen holds but gall . Lull , now , in the mortar 's fire ; Time enough to start the flight . Soar on , mind , but higher , higher ; . The smell of flesh is strong tonight . Across the world and down an alley Sun 's aslant a certain awning . How precise the moment 's tally : You in quilted bed at dawning , And you turn and sigh in sleeping At the instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper , " Mrs. Cusick added , " than to keep it up in your head ? " I replied something about its being pretty good , any way you looked at it . On Friday afternoon the therapy shops and laboratories close their doors and the patients return to their wards . Except for emergency operations , the work of the surgeons is held until Monday . Now , at the week end , with its memory of Saturday nights before the war , time hangs oppressively over the ward rooms . The hospital belongs to the nurses , walking the corridors with their metal trays of pills ; to the chaplains and the visitors , and to Arthur Nelson , the thin , tense Special Services Officer , waging his endless , desperate campaign against boredom . All during the week , Mr. Nelson rallies his forces against the vacuum of time . On Saturday morning he publishes his communiqu ? in The Bronx Cheer , advising the patients that the Bronx Chess Club , Glee Club . Stamp Club and Dramatic Group will hold meetings the coming week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hospital auditorium in a movie called Mother Wore Tights . On Saturday afternoons there are usually free tickets for athletic events , bus tours to Hyde Park and , weather permitting , fishing trips to Long Island Sound . On Sunday afternoons , The Bronx Cheer reminds its readers , visitors are allowed to remain in the wards until the nurses start on their evening rounds . Now , more than two years after the end of the war , there are still plenty of visitors , although not as many as in the first months after V  --  ll Day . " We do n't draw the sight-seers any more , " says Pete Buocavales in the paraplegic ward . " By now , we are n't novelties , and the folks that come are usually relatives . " Sometimes , however , a New York high-school sorority sends its delegates . Young , cheerful and earnest , they keep company with men who do n't have visiting girl friends , wives or parents . But for all his efforts , Mr. Nelson is still fighting a desperate campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him of making the hospital so attractive that nobody wants to go home . When he loses , they say the patients are down in the dumps . On Sunday , when I left the hospital after almost a week there , tbe visitors were just arriving . In the ward rooms , the patients were taking their pills , and in the first-floor chapel the Catholic chaplain was conducting services . Down the corridor I saw Arthur Coakley , the paraplegic who is planning to set up housekeeping on Sheepshead Bay , racing his wheel chair toward the chapel , afraid to be late . When he saw me , he braked his chair for a moment with his hands . " How 's the apartment deal working out ? " I asked him . " It 's coming along fine , " Coakley told me . " We expect to be out of here next week . " Looking over his shoulder , as he started up his wheel chair for the chapel , he said , " I think it 's about time we get out .
