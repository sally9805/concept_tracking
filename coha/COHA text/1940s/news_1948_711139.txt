txt $4631000,000 AID FOR CHINA BACKED BY SENATE GROUP Foreign Relations Committee , Reporting Bill , Says Success Hinges on Her Self-Help HOLDS THIS SHORT IN PAST Nanking Is Criticized Sharply ? Measure Gives Million for Arms ? Is Slated for Passage By WILLIAM S. WHITE Special to Toe Now Yoex Times . WASHINGTON , March 26 ? The Senate , Foreign Relations Committee formally recommended today a $463,000,000 China-aid bill , but bluntly expressed " grave and hon- ' est doubts " as to how effective all this might be in China 's recovery . In a report approving the measure unanimously but without enthusiasm the committee in substance told Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek , head of the Nationalist Government , of its displeasure that " t6o infrequently " had there been adequate measures for Chinese self-help . Such measures , it was added , must now be forthcoming " if our aid is to be effective . " The bill will move to the Senate floor next Tuesday or Wednesday toward early passage . The effect will be a completion by the Senate of the last of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is encompassed in the omnibus $6,205 , - 000,000 foreign aid bill now pending in the House . House Debate on Monday These are the European Recovery Program itself , as originally approved separately in the Senate ; , $275,000,000 in additional and all . . Imilitary aid to Greece and Turkey , and , finally , aid for China . The Greece-Turkey plan was passed by the Senate last Tuesday . The House for its part will resume its debate on Monday . One of the principal managers for the omnibus bill , Representative John M. Vorys , Republican , of Ohio , predicted that it would be passed in the House by Tuesday night . The position tonight , as all Congressional activity was in suspension for Good Friday and the rest of Holy Week , thus indicated a good possibility that the grand and finished design of a vast Congressional program against imperialist communism might be completed and ready for President Truman // by April I. This would be sixteen days ahead of the Italian election of April 18 . As to the $463,000,000 China-aid bill brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - 000,000 of this would be for eco .. 1 nomic help and the remaining $100,000,000 for " whatever purpose is decided upon by the Chinese Government . " U. S. Combat Troops Barred This $100,000,000 , the committee observed , thus " presumably can be used for the procurement of military supplies and equipment if the National Government so desires . " It was stressed , however , that whatever Chiang did with this money , combat units of American troops were " definitely not " to be involved . " China , " the report went on , " is a maze of imponderables . It is impossible to know the quantity and type of aid necessary for the restoration of a stable and independent China . " The committee is convinced , however , that the assistance contemplated in this bill should appreciably strengthen the position of the National Government without , at the same time , involving the United States in any additional commitments of a military nature . " The committee feels that the United States should not be put in the position of being held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political , economic and military affairs . " It is believed that this aid program , designed to meet the most essential commodity requirements , would relieve human suffering and give the hard-working people of China a chance to arrest the rate of economic deterioration in China and to afford the Chinese Government another opportunity to undertake a vigorous program of self-help . " An aid program such as proposed by the Department of State , under the recent realities , may not arouse much hopeful enthusiasm among Americans , though the committee believes it is sufficient to encourage the constructive , democratic elements in China . " Almost the whole of the report carried this theme of reserved misgivings , criticism of Chiang and denunciation of his Communist antagonists . " The unfavorable factors , " the committee summed up , " presently outweigh the favorable . China 's , economy and prospects are marked ' by an eight-year war with Japan ' and a civil war that also includes the usual Communist tactics of disruption , destruction and sabo-1 tage . Corruption Is Charged " Inefficiency , corruption and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dislocation and inflation . Ineptitude in military leadership and corruption among army commanders ' has contributed largely to the lowered morale of the Chinese Government tropps . " The country never developed a favorable balance of trade and the unfavorable balance obviously grew worse in the past few years . " An important psychological factor is the lack of popular confidence in the Chinese Government . " It is hardly necessary to repeat that China faces colossally difficult and complicated tasks and that , accordingly , the further constructive and cooperative role of the United States is not easy to determine and is , perforce , beset with grave and honest doubts . " In spite of all this , the only attack of consequence on the committee 's bill when it reaches the Senate floor was expected to be a strong effort to enlarge authorizations for more money for military aid to China . Senator Styles Bridges , Republican , of New Hampshire , is campaigning for a minimum of $150 , - 000,000 . Key men of the House Arms Services Committee were reported today to be making gress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program . It was expected that it would decide at its next meeting , on Tuesday , when to begin hearings .
