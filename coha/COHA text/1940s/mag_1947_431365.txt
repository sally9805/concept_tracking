ONE day last September our four-engine transport plane squatted on an airport in the wilderness of Newfoundland . The pilot pushed a button in his cockpit ? and then sat back and put his hands in his lap . The airplane took off by itself . The landing gear retracted itself . The throttles presently crept back to cruising power , though no hand touched them . The crew of the plane did n't even know its destination . But the plane knew . It headed east out over the Atlantic as unerringly as a hound on a hot scent . Hours later , this C-54 ? named the Robert E. Lee ? automatically banked and began circling . We were in the vicinity of the airport to which the plane was taking us . Presently we were in a glide , pointed straight for the airport . The downwind end of the runway flashed by . The wheels touched . The throttles cut back to idling speed . Only then did the human pilot , sitting in the cockpit , make a move . With his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands he kept the plane in the middle of the runway until we rolled to a stop We had made the first wholly automatic transatlantic flight in the history of aviation , and I had been lucky enough to be aboard , We had taken off automatically , flown automatically , and landed automatically . What makes push-button flight possible : What opens and closes the throttles , raises . and lowers the landing gear , and points the nose of the plane to its destination ? Flight by robot sounds fantastic , even spooky , to the layman . It is n't , at all . What makes our C-54 work  | is fundamentally as simple as the thermostat in your living room . The thermostat " senses " that the house is too cool . The furnace is actuated by an electrical command . The same thing happens in the U. S. Air Force 's C-54 ; sensor devices indicate that something is to be done , and an actuating device ? an " actuator " ? does it . There was nothing sensational in the way of equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automatic flight had been used in aircraft and other vehicles for years . What was new in our plane was that we had taken these elements , put them all together , and added a series of sensing units developed by the personnel of the All Weather Flying Division . It was the combination , plus these sensing units built on the chassis of instruments and devices already in use in aircraft , that made automatic flight possible . When we started our trip to England by way of Stephenville , Newfoundland , our push-button airplane already had proved itself in trial runs here at home . But we knew that flying the Atlantic might be something else again . There was some tenseness when we neared our first homing radio station in mid-Atlantic . This was a U. S. Coast Guard weather ship on permanent station . About 70 miles from it , according to our air log , we asked the radio operator to hold his key down for 30 minutes so the plane could bird-dog its course . Would everything work ? It was shortly after midnight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilot and copilot who were up in the cockpit , gathered around the master control panel just behind the main cabin bulkhead . Above us the stars were shining . Below us some- where , rolling in the waves , was a tiny vessel . We could n't see it . We were too high and our plane swam in darkness . We could n't even have the satisfaction of a cigarette . Huge cylinders containing supplementary fuel were at our elbows . On the radio signals from that unseen vessel depended our automatic " fix " in uncharted space . From that point we would proceed to our second air-log sequence . Eyes were trained on a compass needle . Then everything happened at once . An amber light flashed on the control panel . The sequence was advancing . The compass needle crept around . The plane banked gently , assuming a new course . Nobody said anything . We just exchanged glances . The smile that was passed around contained , perhaps , as much relief as gratification . But men 's faith must be renewed periodically . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , we gathered around the master control panel . Our concern was justified . The Royal Air Force had installed the USAF Instrument LowApproach System ( SCS-51 ) with only cabled instructions . Would there be a hitch ? The airplane crossed the radio station that had led it in . We knew that had happened when the needle of the radio compass ? standard equipment in all transports ? swung around 180 degrees and pointed backward . It said , " Wait a minute ! Your destination is back there ! " The ordinary radio-compass needle is a non-metallic luminous pointer . Ours , however , was made of metal . As it swung , it closed a switch , just as you would switch on an electric light . The compass , of course , was the sensor . Closing the switch put an actuator into operation . A signal was fed through to the auto- pilot in the cockpit . The autopilot , controlling the ailerons and rudder , put the plane in a gentle bank around the radio station . The signal simultaneously actuated another electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glide . Some other things were happening . The plane had been kept at a constant altitude through a barometric pressure altitude control of the autopilot ? another of the plane 's sensory organs . Now , as the throttles came back for the glide , the barometric pressure sensor was switched off . The plane orbitted and started downstairs . A radio altimeter stepped in as another in the series of sensors . The wheels came down ? automatically . The plane 's nose picked up the runway localizer of the SCS-51 . Then it found the second part of the landing system , the glide path , the invisible highway leading to the runway . Through the haze we could see that we were landing at the RAF Brize Norton Field . The British had done their work well . We repeated the experience , giving our plane its head westward back across the Atlantic . Except for three occasions , when proper radio facilities were lacking , the entire round trip was by push button . While I was the senior officer aboard , the operation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by red-thatched Capt . Thomas J. Wells , the chief test pilot . He was ably assisted by James L. Anast , chief of the automatic flight branch of the All Weather Flying Division ; Captain R. J. Whiting , navigator ; T/Sgt . Welker W. McKee , the crew chief ; S/Sgt . John C. Nimon , engineer ; T /Sgt . Raymond Centolella , radio operator ; and George B. Johnson , technician . There are only a dozen sequences , or phases , fed into the Automatic Flight Con- troller . The system can be modified at will . The fuel-mixture and cowl-flap operations are manual now . Those can be made automatic . Right now the airplane touches down on its two main wheels and its nose wheel . That makes a landing a little rough . It will be simple to add another relay to make the elevator " flare out " the landing at about 50 feet , just as a human pilot does in touching down on the two main wheels first . Yet wholly automatic flight does remain experimental . And it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation whatsoever to the guided missile program . The automatic airplane is not a guided missile . It is an inhabited plane that has been fixed up ' for safe , automatic flight . Perfected , it will represent a vast advancement in the art of flying . Today when ceilings and visibility come down , flights are canceled wholesale in the interests of safety . Automatic flight is going to make flying safe , in any weather . Crewmen on experimental automatic flights are really along for the ride . Of course they have to monitor the equipment and keep notes on performance . When off duty they may play a little gin rummy . George Johnson pocketed 35 cents on the flight from England to Newfoundland . But he worried more about his cards than about the operation of the Robert E. Lee . You see , he was n't sure of his cards .  |
