At big Air Forces training stations , soldiers like to sing as they march . Last week trainees of the Air Forces Technical Training Command at Atlantic City were told that some of their songs would have to be dropped . <P> Offensive to their infantry-trained commanding officer , Colonel Eugene R. Householder , were Roll Out The Barrel , When The War Is Over , Around Her Neck ( she wore a yellow ribbon ) , Oh , My Feet Hurt , I 've Been Working On the Railroad , The Moron Song , How Dry I Am and Hinky-dinky , Parlez-Vous . <P> Reasons for the ban of Stickler Householder , a newcomer to the breezy Air Forces : they might be interpreted as slurs on women , the courage of soldiers or as drinking songs . About all that was left in the marchers ' repertoire : Wait ' til the Sun Shines , Nellie .
