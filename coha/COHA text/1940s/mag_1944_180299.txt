Professional football kicked off against its postwar problems last week and promptly called time out . The National Football League 1 ) accepted a $25,000 down payment on a franchise for Buffalo but delayed final approval ; 2 ) returned a similar deposit from West Coast promoters ( including Bing Crosby ) with the message to come back after the war . The League will put eleven teams on the field this fall , including Boston 's brand-new Yanks , Cleveland 's reactivated Rams and two cannibalized from last season 's Philadelphia-Pittsburgh Eagles . <P> Meanwhile , college football stalled . Lieut . Colonel William J. Bingham of Harvard , chairman of the intercollegiate rules committee , announced that rules are frozen for the war . His staidness ignored cries from coaches and spectators to outlaw out-of-bounds kickoffs and drop restrictions on quick passes . <P> Only in Portugal did football make real progress . There the Football Federation decreed that all players must be able to read &; write .                  @ @ @
