BOSTON , April ** lay members of the Boston College faculty and a lay teacher at its affiliated Jesuit high school have been dismissed for insisting on teaching " ideas leading in bigotry and intolerance , " the Very Rev. William L. Keleher , S. J. , president of the college , asserted today . He said in a statement that the three college faculty members were employed to teach philosophy or physics , and that they had been told to " leave theology to those who were adequately and competently prepared . " Those involved are Dr. Fakhri Maluf , assistant professor of 1philosophy ; James R. Walsh , philosophy instructor ; Charles Eweskio , assistant professor of physics , and David D. Supple , a teacher of German at Boston College High School . They visited Boston . newspaper offices last night with a statement saying that they had been " fired on the spot " because they " accused the college of heresy . " After hearing of Father Keleher 's reply today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had written Pope Pius XII and predicted that " the world is going to hear some thunder from the Chair of Peter very soon , to destroy the heresy of liberalism , the way Pope Pius X destroyed the heresy of modernism . " Dr. Maluf said that he and his colleagues had received a letter " from the Secretariat of State at the Vatican by which we were informed that this doctrinal issue has , at the command of His Holiness , already been placed before the Supreme Congregation at the Holy Office for consideration and attentiop and that His Holiness // has pleasure in assuring the signatories that His Holiness , appreciating the Catholic sentiments which prompted their gesture , cordially imparts to them his paternal apostolic blessing . ' " Asked if they would submit to the Most Rev. Richard J. Cushing , Archbishop of Boston , in the dispute , the four argued that " only the Pope " could settle it . The Archdiocesan Chancellery maintained official silence . A spokesman said that the issue was consideited " a private matter " of the college . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ago that Boston College " would not tolerate " certain of their lecture procedures , and that they would not be allowed to expound in classrooms certain theories they held . In protest , they said , they had written to the Provincial of the Eastern Province of the Society of Jesus , accusing Father Keleher of heresy and stating that their conscientes as teachers were being violated . Three Points at Issue Their objections , they added , were based on the fact that Boston College students were taught " implicitly and explicitly " the following things : 1 . There may be salvation outside the Roman Catholic Church . 2 . A man may be saved ; though he does not hold that the Roman Catholic Church is supreme among churches . 3 . A man may be saved without submission to the Pope . The four said that they were summoned to Father Keleher 's office yesterday and told to withdraw their accusations of heresy and " conscience violation , " or lose their jobs . They added that they were dismissed when they refused . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high school , said that the first he knew of Mr. Supple 's connection with the case came from newspapers . He added that school authorities were attempting to get in touch with the teacher to discuss the situation with him . Mr. Supple , who was at Dr. Maluf 's home in Cambridge this afternoon , said that he considered himself " in the same boat " as his colleagues , and that he saw " no reason for running around after the school authorities . " Father Keleher 's statement was as follows : " These gentlemen in question were under contract at Boston College to teach philosophy and physics . They had been cautioned by me and others in authority here to stay within their own fields and leave theology to those who were adequately and competently prepared . " They continued to speak in class and out of class on matters contrary to the traditional teachings of the Catholic Church ideas leading to bigotry and intolerance . " Their doctrine is erroneous and as such could not be tolerated at Boston College . They were informed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Points to Standard Catechism A college official said that Father Keleher 's stand on salvation was spelled out in the Baltimore Catechism , used by the church for basic instruction of children and of converts . The Catechism says that " he who knows the church to be the true church and remains out of it can not be saved . " In reference to the phrase " remains out of it , " the Catechism states that this " applies to men of bad faith who sin against the truth , " and " it does not apply to men of good faith that belong to the soul of the church . " The Catechism adds that " the soul of the church comprises all that possess God 's grace , even if they are not members .
