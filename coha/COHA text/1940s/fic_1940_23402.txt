MR . PENFOLD A STORY BY H. E. BATES M R. PENFOLD , a traveling draper and haberdasher , easy terms arranged , a painfully shy , retreating man with almost invisible eyelashes , who looked as if he would have been much happier walking backward , struggled out into the countryside every other Thursday on a massive basket-work tricycle , and called on Mrs. Armitage , a war widow , and her daughter Katie . Mr. Penfold , who was in his early forties , was a single man . Mr. Penfold had been calling on Mrs. Armitage and her daughter ever since the War : so long that he had become like one of the family . To the Armitages , who lived at the bottom of a hill , in a redbrick house surrounded by large chimps of lilac under which there was a great trembling spread of snowdrops in early spring , Mr. Penfold had become an institution . " Well , it 's Mr. Penfold 's day , " they said every other Thursday ; then , as the clock drew on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penfold 's time " ; and then at last as they heard the huge wicker-work carrier of the tricycle squeak and clump over the grass verge outside the house , " That 'll be Mr. Penfold . " Then they waited for Mr. Penfold 's knock , a gentle , retreating kind of knock , as if Mr. Penfold had made it and run away . Finally , when with great timidity and decency Mr. Penfold stepped over the threshold , they would say , " Well , it 's Mr. Penfold ? " as if he were a stranger turned up from a far country . On this same afternoon once a fort-night there was always a cup of tea for Mr. Penfold in the Armitages ' comfortable living room , and with it whatever the Armitages had : a boiled egg , tinned salmon , cake , fresh lettuce in summer . In return , after tea was over and the table cleared , Mr. Penfold would carefully and almost religiously lay out his lines , stockings , knickers , handkerchiefs , ribbons , elastic , buttons , woollen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smell which , after so many years , had come to symbolize Mr. Penfold  --  the dry , discreet odor of new drapery , a smell that had come to stand for the grave and timid discretion of a man who appeared to be forever on the verge of folding himself up and putting himself away . It seemed sometimes as if this discretion might flower into something else . It seemed to Mrs. Armitage , who was lonely and who had nothing to look forward to except the careful saving of her meager pension and the growing up and perhaps finally the loss of Katie , that it might flower into something beyond friendship . For many years it seemed as if this might happen , but every Thursday she watched Mr. Penfold go through the same painful , too discreet process of folding himself up and putting himself away for another fortnight . She watched him maneuver the tricycle away from the house and felt a strange conflict of anger and despair , and became resigned at last to the fact that Mr. Penfold would never change , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a revolution . Though she did not notice it , this revolution was going on under her eyes , and once every fortnight under the eyes of Mr. Penfold , though for many years he did not notice it either . There was a revolution going on in the young girl , Katie . When Mr. Penfold first began to call on Mrs. Armitage there was a baby in the house , and sometimes he would take the child on his knee . He had a small gold watch which struck the hours like a little bell , and the child would listen to it for a long time , with dark eyes that had alternate moods of sulkiness and vivacity . As she sat on Mr. Penfold 's knee he would stroke his hand backward and forward with grave pleasure across her hair , which was the color of sun-bleached straw and which , Mrs. Armitage said , would grow darker as she grew older . But for some reason , and to Mr. Penfold 's secret happiness , the hair never grew darker , but remained the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For some years there were no changes in the girl that could startle Mr. Penfolcl . He would see sometimes that the child had grown front one fortnight to another ; there came periodically a time when she needed the next size in underclothes . When he expressed any feeling about the way the girl was growing and changing it was always one of surprise , surprise that time could go so quickly . " She 'll be telling us what to do before we know where we are , " he would say . Then one summer , during the whole month of August , Katie went away to stay with an aunt , and it was six weeks before Mr. Penfold saw her again . During this time there were changes , but to Mr. Penfold unnoticed changes , in the behavior of Mrs. Armitage . One afternoon she said that the plums were ripe in the garden . Would he like to see them ? He said yes , and in his simple way , that had no connection with and did not understand subtleties , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkand thick on the high tree , the skins warm in the rich August sunshine . He took off his coat and climbed the long high ladder and found himself in a deep sun-trembling world of fruit and leaves , his basket hooked on a branch , his two hands free for the great bunches of plums that hung everywhere like blue grapes on the brittle branches . After a time he heard Mrs. Armitage 's voice and looked down and saw her coming up the ladder . It was very warm and she had loosened the neck of her dress . She was a neat , firm little woman with dark-brown crinkled hair and a still young figure , and he had only to glance down in order to sec the hollow of her breasts opening darkly in her loosened dress . She came up the ladder smiling , with slightly parted Iips , but he did not seem to see either her breasts or her smile , and it did not occur to him that he had only to reach down and she would fall into his life more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He remained in the plum tree with her for more than two hours that afternoon , and at no time did he come near to understanding what had brought and kept him there . When he breathed the sweet , almost autumnal fragrance of ripe plums and saw the sunlight breaking through and quivering between the leaf-shadows on his hands and he said how lovely it was in the country , he did not grasp the meaning of her answer , that it was lovely but that you only understood how lovely it was when you lived there always . And when finally they left the tree and he carried the plums indoors for her and she gave him two glasses of her cool homemade wine to drink and begged him to stay and have a little supper , he was still as remote from the meaning of it all as ever . It was still as if he could never reverse the fixed process of habit and nature , and for once unfold and give himself , instead of folding himself up and putting himself away . She was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not know that either . He could not begin to know it , incapable as he was of understanding an inner meaning , kept as he had been by great shyness from any entry into a single great experience . He understood simple , visible things like a yard of velvet , a tree of plums , snowdrops in bloom , a pair of combinations . He understood that Mrs. Armitage had been buying things from him every fortnight more or less for fifteen years and that she paid him by a system of rather parsimonious installments which in his shyness he called " this week 's " ; but he did not understand that she was lonely and unsatisfied . A fortnight later he called again as usual , knocking in his timid way and waiting for an answer . But when the door opened he got for a moment the impression that it had been answered by a stranger . This impression , which went stabbing through his mind like a needle , was gone almost at once , and he saw that the stranger was Katie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before his eyes . In her absence Katie had grown up . She was taller , but he saw more than that . She stood very erect , her young , newly formed breasts pushing against her frock , and it seemed to him that she looked at him with eyes that had in them a kind of sulky hostility . The one thing about her that had not changed was her hair : it had the same shining blondness , but now against the dark self-conscious eyes it seemed doubly beautiful and striking . He was so affected by this transition in the girl that as he came into the house he felt as if something were waiting to explode behind his shyness . He wanted to talk about it , to remark to Mrs. Armitage how suddenly and unmistakably Katie had grown up . But he could not say anything and gradually his great sense of astonishment was repressed and folded away , to become in turn part of his shyness , to become as time went on something that he could not speak about or reveal . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the girl in other ways . It was time , Mrs. Armitage said , that Katie wore some sort of support . She believed in support early ; there was nothing like it , she always held , for starting a good figure . " Besides , she 's going to leave school and start to work . " " Work ? " Mr. Penfold said . " Why , what work , where ? " " She 's going to work down in Denton , in Chapman 's office . She starts next week . Yes , she 's starting to work . " " Well , " Mr. Penfold said . " It does n't seem five minutes since she was a baby . " As he said this Mr. Penfold looked up at the girl , who was standing in the room , her back against a high dresser , her arms folded behind her . He smiled , half expecting her to smile back , but he saw on her face only the new-born , adolescent resentment , not yet hostility , to what he suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stare brought all his own self-consciousness rushing to the surface , and he felt strangely , miserably foolish . He turned hurriedly to the things on the table and was immediately faced with a new problem . It was very rare that he carried such lines as belts or brassi  --  res , and in fact corsetry was rather out of his line , and he knew that he had nothing suitable for the girl . " But I could run the tape round her and bring some over special to-morrow . " " Well , that would do as well , " Mrs. Armitage said . " Katie , let Mr. Penfold run the tape over you . " Mr. Penfold produced the tape-measure from his pocket and unrolled it in his hands , but before he could do anything the girl sprang away from the dresser and went swiftly out of the room . " Well ! " Mrs. Armitage said . " Well ! And that 's how she 's been ever since she got back . Too big to be spoke to , too big to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " It 's all right , " Mr. Penfold said . " Leave her alone . Shall I bring some sizes over to-morrow and she can try them on ? " " I do n't know , " Mrs. Armitage said . " I 'm sure I do n't know . Perhaps we 'd better go down to Lee and Porter 's and go up into the ladies ' department and get it there . " " All right , " Mr. Penfold said . " Seems they grow up to be ladies while your back 's turned . " The girl did not come into the room again , and later Mr. Penfold took away with him the startling impression of her sudden transition and the still more startling impression of her exit from the room . Whenever he thought of the two things he was filled with a sense of her beauty and rebellion . He was aware of the presence in her of moods and attributes which he had never foreseen in the child who had once sat on his knee , listening to his watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he called at the house again , a fortnight later , Katie was not there . Mrs. Armitage looked at the clock on the mantelpiece and said , " She 'll be here very shortly . She gets home about half-past five . Sometimes six . " " Does she like it ? " " You better ask her ! " Mrs. Armitage said . " I ca n't get a word out of her whether she likes it or not . She 's got that proud and big she wo n't tell you anything . " Mr. Penfold did not know what to say . Proud and big ? It was a strange thing to be angry about . He sat down at the table as usual and Mrs. Armitage gave him a cup of tea . And then , about half an hour later , he heard the door open and shut and the footsteps of the girl going upstairs . " That 's her , " Mrs. Armitage said . " One time o ' day you could n't horsewhip her into washing her hands before she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for hours . " Once again Mr. Penfold did not say anything . He lingered over his tea with even more diffidence than usual , partly because the egg that Mrs. Armitage had set before him seemed suddenly distasteful , partly because he wanted to remain in the room until the girl herself came down . In this mood of uncertainty , in which there was also a strange feeling of suspense , he let his tea grow cold , drinking it without quite knowing what he was doing . The cup was actually at his lips when the girl came in , proud and silent and very soft-moving , so that she slipped into her chair , opposite him , as soundlessly as a soft blond cat . He bade her good-evening , the tea still cold on his lips , and she answered him in a low voice . He saw at once that she had grown still more and that the transition from childhood to adolescence , just begun when he had seen her last , was now complete . Every movement and lack of movement now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that he felt his own sense of surprise grow and change into a kind of absentminded wonder , the cold teacup still in his hands and still foolishly suspended midway between his lips and the table , until he abruptly realized it and set it down with a clatter against the spoon . A moment later he got up from the table and made some excuse about going . He knew that he could not sit there at the table with the girl any longer without something happening : something momentous or foolish or even , to his way of thinking , something terrible . He went out into the warm early September evening with a feeling very like fear uppermost in his heart . He did not know what he had to be afraid about ; he was not even sure that what he felt was fear . But , like fear , the emotion propelled him forward , deeply disquieted , uncertain . That evening it still seemed like summer , with delicate fingers of honeysuckle outspread in the hedges , and the sun flat and warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers were saying that it was the finest September for many years , but now all at once he realized that he felt its beauty keenly not just because it was splendid weather but because it was emotionally linked with the beauty of the girl . He saw in the straw-gold color of the honeysuckle the exact shade of her hair reproduced with fearful and lovely fidelity . The honeysuckle floated dreamily by him as he cycled past , and in the same way he felt his dreamy thoughts about her run past him and gather in the distance , too numerous and diffident to catch . From this moment he went on thinking of her , as it were , from a distance . He called at the house every other Thursday , not as if nothing had happened but in the hope that as time went on something would happen . Sometimes he saw the girl , but always with her mother ; sometimes she was late from the office . More often than not he did not speak to her . She continued to remain mutinous and cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing ripe , to be carried soon with a new and conscious air of voluptuousness . In her presence he felt shyer than ever  --  shy , painfully inexperienced , and sometimes foolish , the girl old and mature and fixed in beautiful contempt above him . It was not until three years later that he suddenly found himself alone with her one evening . He had been held up by a puncture three miles away late in the afternoon and had mended it himself on the roadside . It was almost seven o'clock when he got to the house . He knocked shyly on the door as usual , and waited , and it was the girl herself who came in answer . " Oh it 's Mr. Penfold , " she said . " Come in . " He went into the house . It was November and the milk-globed lamp was alight on the table . The light shone upward into the girl 's blond face and on her bright blue jumper and on her bare , smooth arms and hands . But it was not only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that struck him . There was something else . There was a change in her voice and manner . A moment later he knew the reason . " Is your mother in ? " he said . " No , " the girl said . " She thought you could n't be coming . She waited tillsix and now she 's gone down to the village . " Her voice was amazingly friendly and free of all the old mutinous reserve . He had not time to understand it before in a warm , eager way she asked him if he would like some tea . He excused himself by saying it was too late , but she said no , a place had been left for him and all she had to do was boil the kettle . His astonishment at this change in her manner was tremendous . He felt as if he were speaking to her for the first time . He sat and warmed himself by the fire while waiting for the tea and then , as she began to pour it out , the curve of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw that she had brought two cups . Yes , she said , she would have a cup with him , and if he did n't mind she was a bit cold and she would have it sitting on the rug . Before he knew what to say she curled herself up between a chair and the fender , her legs shining with the silvery-pink of ripe oat-straw in the firelight , her breasts drawn up under the close blue wool whenever she turned to look up at him . Then the reason for her prolonged strained attitude began gradually to be clear to him . He did not know what began it , but they began to talk about money . He was saying that the business was there if only the money was behind it . But he was finding money very tight . It had been tight all that year . " Not that I 'm grumbling . I 've saved and taken care of what I have had , " he said ; " only it 's difficult to go on putting it by if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke there was a flash of the old rebellion in her voice . " Yes , and it would puzzle you still more to save if you never had any to save , " she said . For a moment he did not grasp her meaning . Then it all began to come out , as if she had waited for a long time for a moment like this . She began to talk in a rapid , emotional voice , telling him her troubles . She had been at work for three years now and she was still tied to her mother 's apron strings . She worked with other girls who had freedom , took some part of their wages as a right , and had fun in the evening . She had no money and no fun . All of her money went back to her mother , to be doled back in sixpences when she asked for it , to be sparingly saved in a penny-bank and , once saved , never touched again . All that the girl asked was a little freedom , some fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a while . " That 's all I want , " she said passionately . " That 's all I want . I want fun , That 's all . And all the time she wants to keep inc locked in a glass case . " Mr. Penfold listened without knowing what to say , the tea once again growing cold in his hands . The girl would be about nineteen now and it grieved him deeply to see her reaching out for something , for happiness and fun , and not getting it . He looked down at her a moment later and saw that she was crying . He found himself almost glad of her tears , which now saved him from the painful necessity of talking . He let her cry for a few moments and then put his hands lightly on her shoulders . It was the first time he had touched her . She did not move but , as though unaware of him , cried quietly and immovably into her hands . He wanted to move his own hands and grasp her tightly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her , but for what seemed a long time he could not overcome his shyness . At last he did overcome it and very gently moved his hands across her shoulders and partially embraced her . They were sitting like this when Mrs. Armitage suddenly burst into the room , almost as if she had been standing outside in the kitchen , listening . Mr. Pen-fold hastily sat back in his chair and said that Katie was getting him some tea . " Funny way of getting tea , " Mrs. Armitage said . He went away shortly afterward , without speaking again to the girl and without another word being said about her or about what Mrs. Armitage had seen . But when he called a fortnight later , he knew that something had happened . That day he purposely changed his route , not arriving till six o'clock , but the girl was not there and it seemed to him that the atmosphere of the house was strange . He felt that the hostility that had so long been the girl 's had for some reason suddenly been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for tea and Mrs. Armitage 's hat and gloves and Mr. Penfold 's weekly payment book were on the table . No , she did n't want anything . No , there was nothing at all , and she was sorry but she had to go out in a hurry now . " Where 's Katie ? " he said . She looked at him with frank hostility and he knew that she was blaming him for something . " Katie ? " she said . " Katie 's started to live in lodgings in Denton . She 's been worrying about it long enough and now she 's got her way . " " Oh ! " he said . He did not know what to say . It came to him that it was a very strange , sudden decision . There must be a reason for such an abrupt change of attitude . Suddenly he looked at Mrs. Armitage . Her dark eyes were fixed on him with clear rebellious resentment and he knew then that the reason was himself . He knew that , prompted by some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl away from him . " Will there be anything next time ? " he said . It was all he could think to say . He had never said it in fifteen years . " No ! " she said . " I do n't think there will . " " I 'll call just in case . " " Just as you like ! " she said . She stood with her hat and gloves , waiting for hint to go . Two weeks later , for the first time in fifteen years , he did not call . He pushed the heavy tricycle about the lanes with a deep and pointless sense of frustration . He found himself taking the complication of events like a skein of tangled wool and trying to roll them into a simple ball . For what he wanted now was very simple . He wanted the love and beauty of the girl for himself . He wanted to open a little shop in the town and give up the tricycle . At the back of the shop there would be , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the shop a room where they could sit and look down at people passing in the street below . As he lived now he did not eat very well : hasty cold meals in the country , bits of bread and cheese washed down by cocoa in the evenings . But in the shop there would be contentment and comfort and the smell of steak and onions in the evenings . Finally he could bear it no longer . He decided to go back and call once again on Mrs. Armitage . Conquering his shyness , he would somehow tell her what it was all about . For once he would unfold himself , and say how he wanted the girl , how he could go on no longer without her . The following week , almost six weeks after his last call , he again knocked with his habitual timidity on the door and then waited . It was a gray January afternoon , not quite dark , the land settled deep in winter , and he saw that the snowdrops were not yet out in the grass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said : " Oh ! it 's Mr. Penfold . " She held open the door and he went into the house . As he entered the room he almost stopped . It seemed to him , just as it had once before , that a strange girl was sitting by the fire . It was Katie . She was wearing the same bright blue jumper as before and her hair , still as pale as honeysuckle , was brushed in the same way , yet she looked like an inexpressibly strange person , farther away from him than ever . As he came in she stood up , smiling a little . In a moment he knew that the smile , sudden and a little forced and without a trace of hostility , was the signal that something was the matter , and before he could speak to her she went out of the room . He was surprised by that action but not really troubled . Perhaps it would be easier without her . " Has Katie come back ? " he said . " I mean for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , good , " Mrs. Armitage said . " She 's come back . " " Is anything the matter ? " he said . " Matter ? " she said . She walked away from him and stood looking bitterly into the fire . " She 's going to be married . " He stood immovable ; he felt deeply and terribly sick at heart . " She 's got to be married , " she said , " that 's all . You might as well know , first as last . " He stood there for some moments before realizing fully what she had said . Then he knew that there was nothing he could do or say , and he went out of the house . It was dark outside , and he lighted the lamp of his tricycle . As he rode away he recalled that in the papers that morning there had been a forecast of rain , and now he could feel it spitting on his face and hands out of the strong , heavy western wind . He rode on for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could not think clearly , but was conscious only of the strange , once rebellious and now resigned beauty of the girl filling and troubling his heart . He did not feel any bitterness , but only that behind his lifelong shyness something terrible was at last preparing to explode and shatter him . It was as if he had no longer anything to which he could look forward . He walked heavily , oblivious of the rain . The winter was dead all about him and back at the Armitages ' house , under the lilac vines , the snowdrops had not yet come in the grass . " Oh ! my God , " he said to himself , " Oh ! my God , my God . "
