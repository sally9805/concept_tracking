Two Seized as Accomplices Are Held on Murder Charge By FRANK S. ADAMS Special to Tao Now Toon ' Mos. 11 OSSINING , N. Y. , April 14 ? Three long-term convicts , armed with automatic pistols that had been smuggled in to them by outside confederates , staged early this morning the worst prison break Sing Sing has ever known . Their plot , which had been carefully schemed over at least nine months , ended with four persons dead and the recapture of the two surviving convicts after seven hours of freedom . Late tonight , the two survivors of the break faced speedy trial on murder charges .

Four other men , two of them brothers of one of the convicts , were being questioned after having been picked up in New York . Many Puzzling Features District Attorney Elbert T. Gallagher of Westchester County , John A. Lyons , Commissioner of Correction , and Inspector Howard Nugent and Captain John Gaffney of the New York State Police were still trying to solve many puzzling features of the break , which was not only the most costly in lives in the 116-year history of Sing Sing but proved that the ancient institution is , in the words of Warden Lewis E. Lawes , " the weakest prison in the State . " They had established that the three pistols and three sets of hand-1 cuffs were smuggled into the prison in a package strapped to the bot-1 tom of a milk truck on Saturday , March 22 , but they did not know how the plotters managed to hide them in the three intervening weeks . They also learned that a rope used in the escape was stolen from the prison ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine why it was not missed . There also remained to be explained how it was possible for one of the convicts to get imprints of the locks of three doors and make skeleton keys to fit them , and why , although the murder of a prison guard and the escape of three men were discovered at 2:05 A. M. , the outside authorities had not been warned at the time , twenty minutes later , when the jail-breakers encountered two unsuspecting Ossining policemen outside the prison and killed one of them in the pistol battle that ensued . Four Dead in Break The four men who lost their lives as a result of the break were : Prison Guard John Hartye , 55 years old , of 303 St. Ann 's Avenue , the Bronx , who was appointed to the prison staff Nov. 1 , 1922 , and had an excellent record .

The Carefully planned break , which came so close to success , apparently was the result of a pooling of their resources by Riordan and Waters , on the one hand , and on the other . The two younger men , members of the notorious " Paper Bag " gang of bandits that staged a long series of machinegun hold-ups before it was broken up little more than a year ago , were equipped with money and daring outside friends ; contributed prison knowledge and contacts , and the main outlines of the plan . About four months ago Waters was assigned to work in the prison hospital as a nurse and attendant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital on Saturday by feigning illness . Riordan complained of a stomachache and a sharp pain in the side ; said he had sprained his back by lifting ice in the prison ice house . where he was regularly employed . They were placed in the medical ward on the third floor of the hospital with thirty-three other inmates . Two Keepers Unarmed Keepers Hartye and Mateo de Simone were on duty in the hospital , which stands on a hill on the east side of the main line of the New York Central Railroad , which bisects the prison . Both keepers were unarmed , in accordance with a longstanding order of the prison under which only the guards on the prison walls are equipped with firearms . They reported to the prison switchboard by telephone at 2 A. M. that all was quiet . They were supposed to call in every thirty minutes . At 2:05 , however , the switchboard light indicated that their receiver had been lifted from the hook . The prison operator answered , but heard nothing at the other end . He informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of guards . who went to the hospital to investigate . There Sergeant Darrow found Keeper Hartye dead on a bed , where he had been placed by some of the inmates . Darrow at once notified Warden Lewes , who hurried to the hospital . Meanwhile , Sergeant Darrow had peen informed by some of the inmates that Hartye had been shot in the back without warning by one of the plotters , who had feigned sleep on his cot , and that the three men had thereupon rushed out of the ward toward the lower floors of the building . One of the inmates had taken the receiver off the hook to give the alarm , but evidently had failed to say anything for fear of prison vengeance on an informer . Warden Lawes and a group of the guards went to the basement of the building . where , locked in a small room . they found Keeper de Simone and an inmate trusty whose name was withheld by the warden . I They told their rescuers that the three convicts , each displaying a pistol . had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to the basement , unlocking a wooden door that led to it with a key . Dissuaded From Killing On the way , they said , the convicts threatened to kill them but were dissuaded when de Simone warned them that the sound of shots might lead to their capture . The convicts contented themselves with punching and slapping their prisoners before locking them up . The jail breakers dropped the key to the wooden door on the floor of the cellar , where it was retrieved later in the day . The keeper and trusty saw the three convicts open the first of two steel doors in the basement with what appeared to be a skeleton key made out of brass or copper . They also evidently used it to open a second door farther along in the cellar , and thus gain access to a tunnel through which run steam pipes from the prison power house on the west side of the New York Central railroad tracks to the hospital on the east side . Led by , who formerly had worked in the power house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inched their way through the passage , which is barely large enough to permit the entry of a man . They followed it about 203 feet , to the point where the steam pipes emerge into the open air and are carried on a trestle across the railroad tracks to the power house . At this point there is a vertical drop of twenty-nine feet and six inches from the mouth of the tunnel to the railroad tracks . The mouth of the tunnel is outside the prison wall , but only about forty feet from it is a guard tower with an armed keeper on duty . The night was black and starless , however , and the guard noticed nothing when the men lowered themselves to the railroad tracks by the rope that had been stolen from the ice house several weeks before . Railroad Tracks Followed Riordan , a stocky , barrel-chested ex-stevedore with a great sheaf of pale blond hair ; , a slight wisp of a man , and Waters , all wearing gray prison trousers and soiled white shirts , stumbled along the railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile from where the tracks emerge from the prison , the three men started along lower Main Street . About a quarter of a block from the New York Central station in Ossining , Patrolmen Fagan and William Nelson had parked their radio car , and Nelson had left it momentarily to go down the street a short distance . Fagan , sitting at the wheel of the car , saw the three men approaching and asked them who they were . A shot through the windshield that hit him in the chest was the reply . Fagan , a crack pistol shot who had won many trophies in competition , staggered out of the car and emptied his own weapon at the three men before he collapsed . Nelson , from a point about 200 feet away , also began firing at the men . Waters was struck in the forehead and killed almost instantly , and the other two men fled toward the Hudson River . Nelson ran to the car and over its two-way radio notified Ossining police headquarters what had happened . Another radio car sped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot to the Ossining Hospital , but both were dead when they reached there . Meanwhile the fugitives had covered about 500 feet on foot in the inky blackness before reaching the I river front , where Charles Rohr was packing shad for shipment to the Fulton fish market . They pressed their pistols against his side and ordered him to get into his sixteen-foot rowboat , which was tied up at the dock . One convict sat in the boss and the other in the stern , keeping Rohr covered as they commanded him to row them across the river . Car and Machine Gun Found The Ossining police , unaware that the men had reached the river , were searching the neighborhood of the shooting . Parked in a dark spot under a bridge across the railroad tracks , two blocks from the scene of the shooting , they found a 1939 Plymouth two-door sedan , bearing the license plates 6K7046 . In its back seat was a Thompson submachine gun , fully loaded . Investigation soon disclosed that the car had been stolen last night from in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at 411 West End Avenue , New York , and that the license plates had been taken from another car that had been stolen Feb. 23 . That car was subsequently recovered with the plates missing . Clifford Ellworthy , a taxi driver , was sitting in the office of his employer at 39 Spring Street , about a quarter of a mile from the point where the car was found , when two men approached him a few minutes before 3 A. M , and asked him to drive them to White Plains . Ellworthy , who had heard of the shooting of Patrolman Fagan , I thought the manner of the men was suspicious . He let them get into his car , but delayed starting on the pretext that he had to call his employer before starting out of town . Patrolman Vincent Kelly came around the corner of Spring Street while Ellworthy was delaying . The taxi driver motioned toward the car and Kelly , also aware of the shooting , pulled his pistol and ordered the men out . He searched them , found they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There the men were identified as William Wade , 30 , of 267 West Thirty-sixth Street , New York , and Edward Kiernan , 33 , of 223 West Twenty-first Street . The police said Wade was held in jail for ten months as a suspect in the Consolidated Gas Company holdup , but eventually was released for lack of evidence against him . Kiernan , they said , was released from Sing Sing in February , 1940 , after serving a ten-year term for burglary . ( Wade and Kieran admitted , said State troopers who questioned them at the Hawthorne barracks , having parked the car under the bridge and having taken part in the smuggling of the pistols and handcuffs into the prison . The two were quoted as saying that they had been expecting to return to New York in another automobile , driven by two other men , for whom the police began a search , but had missed ' connections . Thereupon , the two waited in a tavern for some time , until they heard shots , before they Map shows the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fugitives were captured after forcing a fisherman to row them across the Hudson River from the vicinity of Sing Sing . attempted to leave Ossining by taxicab , according to the troopers . ) Meanwhile the hunt for the fugitives was being widened as rapidly as possible . The State police barracks a Hawthorne , N. Y. , not far away , was notified , and a nineState teletype alarm was broadcast at 3:31 . Soon the police of Croton , Pleasantville and other nearby communities had joined in the search . The Croton police got a steam locomotive from the New York Central shops at Harmon and used it to search the railroad right-of-way for several miles . An appeal was sent to the Coast Guard in New York City for assistance , and the cutter Mahoning , the patrol boat 408 , two launches , and a seaplane were sent upstream to patrol the Hudson , which is more than three miles wide at this point . Some fishermen acquaintances of Rohr who had seen his departure under what were evidently strange circumstances , meanwhile had told the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the communities on the west shore of the river . A posse of police also set out in a launch borrowed for the occasion , but they reported that the night was so black they could see nothing , and the noise of their motor drowned out any possible sound of oarlocks . Rohr , battling against the tide , was about an hour and a half rowing his boat and his unwelcome passengers across the river , he said later . As he neared the west shore Riordan and discussed whether they should shoot him to keep him from betraying their landing spot , he said . He convinced them . according to his account , that his death would be simply another murder against them without doing them any good . Landed in Hook Mountain Area The two men landed on the sandy beach of the Hook Mountain section of the Palisades Interstate Park , at a point about half way between Haverstraw and Nyack . As they disappeared into the underbrush Rohr put his tiny craft around and headed back for home . A violent downpour of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delayed him somewhat , But he got back to Ossining between 5 and 6 A. M. and at once informed the police , thus giving them their first definite clue to the whereabouts of the missing men . Two bloodhounds , Sappho and Monk , had been brought to Ossining from the barracks of Troop K of the State Police at Hawthorne , and Warden Lawes had provided underclothing and bed clothing of the escaped men to give them the scent . As soon as Rohr 's information came in the bloodhounds , their keeper , Trooper W. W. Norton , and a posse of State Troopers and Ossining police crossed the river by boat and went to the landing point . Even before their arrival the police on the other side had- been notified of Rohr 's story , and Patrolman Patrolman James Fagan , who I died in gun battle . TImes wise world I Wallace Mullens of the Interstate Park Police . an expert hunter and woodsman , had found the footprints left by the escaping men on I the sandy beach . From here the dogs took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north through the dense underbrush and woods of the park . Mullens and Norton , who were in the van of the posse of eight men , heard a crackling sound in the bushes up a steep hill about seventy-five yards from where they stood . Soon they saw the two men for whom they were searching . The convicts still wore their gray prison trousers and white shirts , but someIwhere they had found and donned two dirty , ragged suede jackets . Surrender Without Fight The fugitives were still unaware of the approach of their pursuers when Mullens called upon them to surrender , warning them they were covered . Riordan and saw that resistance was hopeless and surrendered meekly . Both handed over to their captors loaded .38 cal1 fiber automatic pistols and accompanied the posse back to the river bank . The capture took place a few minutes before 9 A. M. Riordan and were returned to Ossining by the Coast Guard patrol boat 408 . As they were taken off the boat , their hands manacled , several Ossining policemen kicked and cuffed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed to the Hawthorne barracks , where , with Kiernan and Wade , they were questioned all day . eventually admitted , according to the authorities , that he had been planning the break for the last nine months , and that the active preparations had been under way for several weeks . He admitted that on March 22 he had received the package containing the pistols and handcuffs after it had been fastened to the underside of a milk truck serving the prison . He also confessed taking the imprints of the locks , making the keys and stealing the rope from the ice house . and Riordan both endeavored to place the blame for the shooting of Hartye and Fagan on their dead companion , Waters , the authorities said . District Attorney Gallagher and the other men questioning the prisoners declined to , say what they had learned from Wade and Kiernan , against whom no charge had been placed late tonight . Four Stevedores Seized Here However , shortly before 6 P. M. a detail of State police went to New York City and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up four stevedores for questioning , in the neighborhood of Piers 83 and 84 , at West Forty-third and West Forty-fourth Street . The Imen were taken back to Hawthorne , where they were being examined late last night . These men are Andrew Riordan , 24 , and John Riordan , 32 , brothers of Joseph Riordan , and giving as their residence 577 Isham Street , which was his home until he was sent to Sing Sing ; John Clinton , 25 , of 71 Vermilyea Avenue , and Thomas Waters , 28 , of 532 West Fiftieth Street . Despite the similarity in name , Waters was not related to the convict killed in the break , the authorities said . While this activity was going on elsewhere , Commissioner of Correction Lyons proceeded to Sing Sing to begin a thorough investigation of the situation there . He declined to discuss the matter with reporters , but Warden Lawes explained some of the details of the case . The warden said that the tunnel through which the men escaped is not sealed because it was believed the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and because it is necessary to send repair men into the tunnel frequently . He said that , during his assignment at the prison power house , had had an opportunity to familiarize himself with the tunnel . Warden Lawes said the smuggling of the pistols into the prison by a milk truck undoubtedly would result in a closer scrutiny of the trucks from now on . He pointed ' out , however , that from fifteen to thirty trucks pass through the gate of the prison every day . The number is particularly high just now because of a construction job under way , the rebuilding of one of the cell blocks . Delay in Alarm Explained The delay in notifying the outside authorities  --  the break was discovered at 2:05 and the alarm was not given until some time after the killing of Patrolman Fagan at 2:25 A. M. ? was explained by Warden Lawes on the ground that he and his subordinates believed the escaped men were still in the basement of the hospital , find never dreamed they had gotten beyond the prison walls . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prison walls were not uncommon . Joseph Riordan and were returned to Ossining late today for arraignment before Police Judge Vincent J. Fuller on two charges of murder in the first degree . Each was accused of the killing of Keeper Hartye and also of the slaying of Patrolman Fagan . The two men stumbled into the court room as if in a daze and listened to the reading of the information charging them with felony murders  --  the commission of a murder during the commission of another felony , in this case jail breaking . The two men , who were not represented by counsel , pleaded not guilty and waived examination . Judge Fuller ordered them committed to the Westchester County jail at Eastview to await the action of the grand jury . However , they were returned to the Hawthorne barracks of the State police , where the investigation was still proceeding tonight . District Attorney Gallagher briefly expressed in court his sympathy for the families of Fagan and Hartye . Later he told reporters I that the case might be submitted to the grand jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a considerable amount of investigation was still to be performed . Dewey Scores Convicts District Attorney Thorns E. Dewey of New York County issued a statement yesterday in which he said that Riordan and Waters were " two of the worst criminals ever prosecuted by this office . " " In the light of what these escaped men might have done while at liberty their capture was an excellent and very important job , " he declared . All three convicts involved in the break were thoroughly hardened criminals , their records at Police Headquarters disclosed . Riordan was first charged with juvenile delinquency in 1925 . Since then his record is studded with frequent arrests . He went to the Catholic Protectory for juvenile delinquency in 1928 , to Elmira Reformatory for grand larcency in 1933 , back to Elmira for violation of parole in 1938 and to Sing Sing in 1940 . In between were numerous arrests for such crimes as burglary , assault and robbery . Waters 's first arrest was for petty larceny in 1924 . He was put on probation then , but in 1925 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He served a term in Elmira Reformatory for grand larceny and the possession of concealed weapons , and in 1931 was sent to Sing Sing for seven years for illegal possession of a revolver . He has been charged at other times with felonious assault , robbery and violation of parole . , oldest of the trio , has a record stretching back to 1915 , when he was fined $2 for disorderly conduct . He got a suspended sentence for grand larceny in 1917 ; was sent to Sing Sing for two and a half to five years for the same offense in 1921 ; was sent back to Sing Sing on a seven-year sentence for illegal possession of a pistol in 1928 , and then evaded charges of burglary , assault and robbery before his conviction of the crime for which he is now in prison .
