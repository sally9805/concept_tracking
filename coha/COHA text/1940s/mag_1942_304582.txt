WITH JAPAN 'S LEADERS - Frederick Moore-Scribner ( $2.75 ) . <P> For 14 years Frederick Moore served the Japanese government as adviser on international affairs . Seven ambassadors to Washington-Shidehara , Hanihara , Mat-sudaira , Debuchi , Saito , Horinouchi , Nomura-worked with his assistance . He was a member of the Japanese delegation which went to the League of Nations to argue Japan 's case for the invasion of Manchuria . When Matsuoka , the delegation 's head ; insolently marched out of the League Assembly , he was followed by all his fellow delegates save Frederick Moore . <P> " I remained , " writes Moore , " till I felt too conspicuous to stay any longer-a lone man in a crowded hall occupying one among 20 vacant chairs on the floor . . . . " And , finally , Moore was with the Japanese Embassy in Washington through the last desperate months before Pearl Harbor . In the summer of 1941 he had believed he could do nothing to restore Japanese-American relations , and told Ambassador Nomura so . But Nomura insisted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he admitted , " but we must continue the struggle anyway . " <P> Moore 's close connection with Japan 's government was no innovation . Since the days of Commodore Perry Japan 's leaders had clearly seen that to compete successfully with the Western powers they must hire Westerners as teachers . German officers came to train the army , British and American sailors to train the navy , and a mixture of many nationals to teach foreign languages and sciences , to advise on administration and the conduct of foreign relations , " to assist in changing the nation from a confusion of medieval feudal baronies to a united modern state . " Moore came to them with no special training beyond his 20 years as a newspaper correspondent in Europe and the East . " I am an authority on general information " he told his Jap employers , and left it at that . He made a point of plain speaking to his bosses , combining truth with tact and he got along well with the diplomats , being , in his own archaic phrase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> Devil 's Advocate . Today , Author Moore believes the Japanese must be utterly defeated , that " we can no more compromise with them than we can with the Germans . " But eight years ago , and for long thereafter , compromise was his only mission . He never ceased to warn Japan 's leaders that their army must be curbed , that a clash with the U.S. would be fatal to their country . On the other hand he pleaded their cause against U.S. critics . He could see no reason why Japan should not annex Korea- " a badly governed area " smaller than the American prize of the Philippines . He believed Formosa to be " better off under Japanese control . " In order to " play fair , " he defended <P> Japanese " entry " into Manchuria . Manchuria , he argued , was populated by " only 30 million people , " and was rich and fertile . It seemed to provide every reason for not invading China . For it was over China that even Mr. Moore 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found himself unable to support " an army domination which not only assassinated its own chiefs of state , but also provoked wanton wars at will .
