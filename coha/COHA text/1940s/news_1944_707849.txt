txt Factory Inspection Urged Last Friday a man and two women were trapped in a burning factory . This tragedy again makes painfully clear that all factory laws , especially safety regulations , must be policed vigilantly . There can be no substitution for constant inspection in the enforcement of these laws . Other methods , such as education , might well be used in addition , but not in place of continuous policing . Men and women at work have every right to expect that their conditions of work shall be kept safe at all times . An inspection now to determine whether " building violations caused the fatalities " or whether permission had been granted to block " the entrance to one outside fire-escape " is of small comfort to the victims ' families .
