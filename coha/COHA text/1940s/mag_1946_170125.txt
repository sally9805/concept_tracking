Halfway down Pimlico 's home stretch , it looked like the ' Kentucky Derby all over again . Assault , the clubfooted chestnut that ran away with the Kentucky Derby , was three lengths outin front . Then Elizabeth Arden Graham 's slow-starting Lord Boswell came charging up . At the finish , Assault , obviously tiring , was just a neck ahead-enough to earn the $99,120 first prize . On the record , Assault was the best of 1946 's three-year-olds , but his Preakness winning time ( 2:01 2/5 ) was the slowest in 13 years . Ten years before , Assault 's daddy , Bold Venture , won the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness-and never another race .
