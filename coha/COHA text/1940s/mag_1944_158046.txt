In a recent widely published advertisement appeared this " letter , " an advertising copy writer 's idea of a G.I. 's dream : <P> " Dearest Mom : So old Bess has pups again . . . . She had her last litter two years ago - just about this time of year - when everything was so fresh and new . <P> That 's what I want to get back to ... that world back home where a fellow can give the sort of welcome he ought to give to a litter of setter pups in the spring . To watch them grow up with all the other new , young things in a world that 's bright and free . . . . Your loving son , Bill . " In Normandy the ad caught the eye of an insulted soldier writer for a service paper called Le Tomahawk , who raised a tomahawk and went to work . <P> " We think it 's high time the copy writers learn that this war is being fought by grown men , " he wrote . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for reasons which grown men understand . . . . <P> But since the public seems to think that soldiers are simple asses , drooling slush in the face of machine-gun fire , we offer the following copyrighted ' Dear Mom ' letters direct from the front : <P> " Dear Mom : Well , here we are in Normandy . I saw a cute little piggy-wiggy today , Mom , and gracious was he cute . That 's what I 'm fighting for , Mom - little piggy-wiggies and little ducky-wuckies and little lambie-wambies and , oh , just oodles of young , free things to brighten a brave new world . Your loving son , Joe . <P> " Dear Mom : We are camped in an orchard not far from Carentan that you 've read about , Mom , and there are dairy cows grazing in our orchard and the peasants come right out in their wooden shoes and milk them , and Mom , one of the cows made fertilizer right where I put down my blankets . Golly , Mom , it sure smelt good and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's what I 'm fighting for , Mom , a world in which there wo n't be no soldiers putting down their blankets right where old Muley wants to make fertilizer . Your loving son , Junior . <P> " Dear Mom : We were going through some hedgerows toward Saint-L today , Mom , and a German burp-gun got on me and I ducked in a ditch and set off a Teller mine , and a Tiger tank ran right over my ditch , and a squad of Boche infantry started heaving fragmentation grenades at me and I got to thinking , Mom , of old Bess and her about to have pups again , and Mom , we ca n't have them pups born into a world that ai n't free and bright , can we , even if it 's the way you said old Bess got out that night and was bred by that mongrel next door , so , Mom , I got right out of my ditch and fixed that tank good and proper , and also the burp-gun and the Boche infantry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just as soon as we can for you and Dad and old Bess , and a better , brighter world for that little unborn litter . Your loving son , Henry . "
