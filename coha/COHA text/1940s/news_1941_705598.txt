txt DE VALERA WARNS ON DRAFT IN ULSTER Says ' Outrageous ' Plan Would End Good-Will  --  Opposition Leaders Back His Stand By HUGH SMITH Special Cable to THE NEW YORK TIMES . DUBLIN , May ** a special session of the Dail Eireann , which lasted less than an hour , leaders of all political parties in Eire publicly registered their opposition this evening to the proposal to apply conscription to Northern Ireland . The occasion brought big crowds to Leinster House , where the Dail sits , many expecting a dramatic speech from Prime Minister Eamon de Valera , but the speeches of all three leaders who addressed the Chapber were restrained . Among , those in the crowded visitors ' galleries were Sir John Maffey , British representative in Eire ; United States Minister David Gray and Herr Thomsen , secretary of the German Legation . Mr. de Valera-made his statement to a packed , intent house . It was carefully prepared and delivered in a tone of calm deliberation . " From the moment the British Prime Minister indicated that the British Government had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern Six Counties I am sure , " declared Mr. de Valera , " that there is not an Irishman in any part of Ireland who did not see at once the magnitude of the issues involved and the dangers that Jay in this proposal . Calls Partition " Deadly Wound " " Shortly after the recent announcement I made representations to the British Government urging as strongly as I could the reasons why the policy which they have hitherto pursued in this regard ' // DE YALERA WARNS ON ULSTER DRAFT // should not be changed . There is not an Irishman in any part of the world who does not regard continuing partition as a deadly wound inflicted upon the body of this nation . I do not think there is a true Irishman anywhere who would like to contemplate ' it other than as a passing phase or a temporary expedient , " The Six Counties are a part of Ireland . They nave always been a part of Ireland . No Act of Parliament can alter this fact . In the Six Northern Counties there are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against being cut off from the main body of the nation , who were so cut off against their own will and against the will of the majority of the whole Irish people . It would be an outrage to compel them to fight in the forces of another country which has done them , and continues to do them , grievous wrong . " Must Live as Neighbors Then , referring , to relations with Britain , the Prime Minister said : " No matter what political or economic changes may take place in the world , the people living in these two islands are destined ' or all time to live as neighbors upon the earth . Surely , then , it must be the aim of statesmen on both sides to make the relationship between the people of these islands that of friendly neighbors . " Having referred to his work to preserve relations with Britain " by removing any cause of quarrel , " Mr. de Valera , dealing with Eire 's neutrality , observed that " as was our right and as was the universal wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has been a friendly neutrality . We have in every peaceful way , and as far as lay in our power , endeavored to preserve our peacetime cooperation and have refrained from doing anything which could be regarded as hostile to Britain . Fears End of Good-Will Era " We pledged ourselves years before this war began that we would not permit our territory'to be used as a basis of any enemy attack upon Britain and the forces we have organized here to maintain our neutrality are our guarantee that we mean to keep that pledge . Should the British Government go ahead with its proposal to enforce conscription upon the people of the Six Counties , the work which has been accomplished with the utmost patience , perseverance and goodwill over a long period of years will be undone and the people of the two islands will be thrown back again into the old , unhappy relations . " Mr. de Valera then explained to the House that he called the Dail together to show that the representations made against conscription did not come from one man or from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State . " I have tried , " he concluded , " not to say- anything here which would make it more difficult for the British Government to give calm consideration and full weight to the representations which I have made . " Former President William T. Cosgrave , now Opposition Leader , who followed , spoke of the present situation as exceedingly dangerous which , if not properly handled , might involve the very existence of this State . As one who did his- utmost during the past twenty years to improve relations between this country and Britain Mr. Cosgrave declared that the conscription proposal came to him as a shock . If the proposal was carried out he felt that the evil results that must inevitably ensue in both parts of Ireland and elsewhere would far outweigh any advantages to Britain that might for the moment seem to follow from such a step . Urging that every effort should be taken to avoid drifting into conflict with Britain , Mr. Cosgrave said that a stop should be put to any deterioration of relations with Britain and her government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would follow conflict with Britain and even with the United States should she enter the war . Labor leader William Norton declared that " conscription of our people in the Six Counties would be an outrage upon every canon of liberty by a nation which proclaims its adherence to the principles of liberty and justice .
