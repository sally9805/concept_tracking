Everyone knew that retired Brigadier General Evans F. Carlson was a Marine , and a good one . In the early days of the Pacific War , his Gung Ho Raiders wrote heroic headlines at Makin and Guadalcanal . Not so many U.S. citizens knew that General Carlson had also long been an apostle of Communistic causes and Communist-fringe groups . In 1939 , after traveling 2,000 miles as a military observer with China 's Communist Eighth Route Army , he had resigned from the Marines to push his crusade . Last week Old China Hand Carlson made his ideology perfectly clear to everyone . <P> At a press conference in Manhattan , General Carlson and Russophile Singer Paul Robeson , cochairmen of the National Committee to Win the Peace , announced a San Francisco conference for next month to urge withdrawal of U.S. troops from China , withdrawal of U.S. support from Chiang Kai-shek 's Nationalist Government . Said Cochairman Carlson : " The only democratic force in China is that being fostered by the Communists . People in this country do n't like that word Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind words and find out about actions . " <P> Russian Accent . His advice had an ironic twist . Behind the laudable words in the title of his Win the Peace Committee were a spate of suspicious actions . One of its founders was the C.I.O. Electrical Workers ' Julius Emspak , also a sponsor of the American Peace Mobilizers , who had picketed the White House early in 1941 with cries of warmongering , then neatly flip-flopped the day Germany invaded Russia . One of the speakers at the inaugural convention was a member of Greece 's Communist-led EAM ; others were from the far left wing of the U.S. Congress : Washington 's Hugh de Lacy , California 's Ellis Patterson . <P> At a later meeting of the New York chapter , Win the Peace seemed hell-bent on highballing down the Communist Party line . In a strong Russian accent , delegates clamored for destruction of all atom bombs , repudiation of the Baruch report , acceptance of the Soviet plan for " outlawing " atomic war . Scrupulously avoiding mention of Russian occupation armies , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China , the Philippines and Greece . <P> On Win the Peace 's membership rolls there was plenty of window dressing with such innocent names as Songstress Lily Pons and Author Henry Seidel Canby . But there were also the names of New York 's Communist Councilmen Peter V. Cacchione and Ben Davis , Manhattan 's Party-line Congressman Vito Marcantonio , Daily Worker Columnist Frederick V. Field . Communist-dominated unions were heavily represented .
