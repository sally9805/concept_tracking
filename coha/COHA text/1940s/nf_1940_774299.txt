txt  | THE METHOD OF DETERMINATE DISCUSSION Distinguishing Characteristics In using the term to designate a specialized type of conference technique the word " determinate " is applied to constructive discussion of which the scope is restrained and the direction pre-determined . It is thus a training method which differs from informal discussion and from the " conference method " as generally used in training foremen in industry in the following ways : ( i ) Each discussion meeting has specific purposes or objectives . Within the time allotted a resolute effort is made to achieve those purposes and to discuss a definite amount of subject matter . ( 2 ) The discussion is directed by the leader to conform to a standard design or pattern . This " blueprint " and time schedule is contained in a pre-determined discussion outline which should follow a logical sequence and be systematically organized . ( 3 ) The chart summaries of the topic prepared in advance serve two purposes . They serve as a guide for the leader who endeavors to have the group suggest their more important points . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group at the close of the meeting to serve as reference notes ; this reinforces the actual discussion . ( 4 ) Emphasis is laid on group citation of specific case material in order to bring out the cold , hard facts of experience for illustrative purposes . Considerable attention is also devoted to precise methods of charting or the recording of ideas brought out in the discussion . ( 5 ) The leader takes an active and substantial part in directing the path rather than the substance of the discussion but without dominating the meeting or forcing his own personal opinions . Since these points are observed at each meeting of a discussion group the entire training series naturally takes on more decisiveness and tends to be more specific and productive . Advantages of Systematizing the Discussion In more closely controlling group discussion a number of objectives may be expected . The leader is provided with a kind of road map 20  | which shows him where he is going and how he can reach his destination . The use of such a guide or pattern makes the task of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous experience in such work . Advance information as to the nature of the discussion contemplated , as to the curriculum contemplated , is desirable and helpful for executives about to sponsor a supervisor training program . A free conference training plan is frequently inaugurated without knowing how many meetings are to be held or what topics are to be discussed . The series may run on indefinitely and the supervisors have no information as to how much of their time will be demanded . A determinate discussion ensures that important points will be reached in the course of a meeting . The outlines herein presented are set up to include enough material for a two hour discussion placing special emphasis on case material . Providing the discussion . leader with a specific outline tends to eliminate aimless sidetracking and the injection of unrelated topics which may be dangerous . The disposition of a conference to turn into a " bull session " is thereby minimized since an outline keeps both the leader and the group in line . Of lesser importance is the fact that pre-determined outlines simplify the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conferences . This is especially true in a larger program in which several discussion groups are in training at the same time . In short then , in setting up a target , a discussion group is more likely to hit a bull 's eye . Possible Criticisms There may be those who feel that it is impossible to standardize or formalize a training instrumentality of which the essence is informality . They may raise a cry of strait-jacketing free discussion , of censorship , and of deliberate indoctrination . However , the method of controlled discussion is not necessarily one of propaganda and care should be taken to see that it is not used for that purpose . It is a perfectly proper device , if the objectives are above question as far as t he group is concerned , for the leader to attempt to reach the goal by asking appropriate questions and by excluding such replies and comments as tend to lead the group into barren pastures . It is legitimate to use such a method where the goal merely involves rational acceptance of common sense principles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expressing themselves and in need of guidance in summing up their ideas into neatly phrased concepts . The significant point in any allegation of improper restraint is that there k no curtailment of any group member 's privilege to express any opinion he chooses . His contributions must he to the point , however . Free electricity in the form of lightning is dissipated and may be  | harmful ; electricity conducted through a cable accomplishes valuable results . Anarchy may permit complete freedom of individual action but that argument is hardly a sound reason for criticizing the controls necessitated under democracy . So it is with the regulation of discussion ? the direction and control exercised in tactful leadership has not in actual experience been resented as a curtailment of individual freedom of expression . Rather is it appreciated as an aid in constructive thinking . Nor is the leader 's initiative and inventiveness curtailed when he follows a specific discussion pattern . Each discussion group and subject application is distinctively different and offers infinite opportunity for the leader to exercise his ingenuity . At first glance it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contributions offered . In actual practice , however , this is found not to be the case . The control is exercised on the pathway of the discussion but not on the details of its content . It is true that at times conference groups are surprised to find out how closely their conclusions tally with those shown on the standard charts passed out at the close of the meeting . A conference leader in charge of training groups of male supervisors recently met with a group of women supervisors to analyze their responsibilities . After the women had an opportunity to compare a list of their duties as they understood them with the mimeographed list passed out by the leader several of them came to the leader and said : " Just how did you know of what our jobs consisted ? " It is desirable for the leader to meet such a situation by explaining to a discussion group that the chart material distributed is a composite of the conclusions reached by a great many groups of supervisors . There will then be no feeling of constraint when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferably be developed experimentally with various supervisor groups as were those contained in Part II of this volume . The standard outlines shown there were built up and revised by actually trying them out on hundreds of foremen-supervisor groups . When supplementary discussions are held to obtain group agreement as to desirable action to be taken the topic should at least be definitely outlined and a systematic discussion pattern worked out in advance . In the discussion of such special and local problems there is of course no question of spontaneity ; it follows as a matter of course because the group very obviously determines its own distinctive conclusions . This would be the case , for example , in a conference called to consider the best method of applying wage cuts which have been found necessary in a given organization . Such a problem cap be presented to the group without necessarily suggesting a predetermined answer . On the other hand , when a group is brought together to discuss a broad subject such as that of improving cooperation , certain general principles or maxims can be assumed in advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his discussion pattern around these principles because he knows they will be accepted by the group . Specific and original deductions and applications of the general principles will nevertheless be made by the group in the course of its discussion . These will serve to maintain spontaneous interest and will overshadow any appearance of regimentation of thought . Determinate discussion should be used only with groups brought together for what its members recognize as formal training in specific subject matter , outlines for which have been developed experimentally in advance . It should not be used , for example , with a voluntary civic group representing a range of social and vocational background and seeking conclusions on socio-economic problems . In such a situation , the group must decide its own discussion topics and share the responsibility for the pathway the discussion is to follow . Creative discussion can not be expected of a civic group , or even from foremen working out an unforeseen operating problem , when they realize that they are being led by the nose . In commenting on freedom of discussion under such circumstances , Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Leaders who imagine they persuade a group toward a predetermined outline which they themselves thought up ' delude only themselves . " It does not follow , of course , that the leader should disregard the need for preparing detailed outlines and source material as logical guides for his group in their deliberations . Steps in a Typical Determinate Discussion What actually transpires in the course of a controlled discussion may be illustrated by describing a typical conference on " Making Cooperation Effective . " The outline for this appears as No. 15 in Part II . The reader should carefully scan this outline at this time , giving particular attention to the three charts found at its close . A brief section entitled " Purpose of the Discussion " is first shown for the information of the leader and that he may understand the scope of the topic . The " Preface " section is intended to contain ideas which may be used in introducing the topic and may provide other directions for the leader 's guidance . The leader first needs to set the stage and introduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is normally done in perhaps five minutes or so through a few thought-provoking questions or by telling of a live incident or illustration . It is unnecessary for the leader to make a set speech in his introduction and he should not memorize the points which may be suggested in the " Preface . " The introduction should be tied in with earlier discussions in order that the topic may seem to be a natural and logical one for the meeting in question .  | After the group shows itself definitely interested and ready to discuss details the leader may propose that some logical plan of discussion will be helpful and indicate what the path or plan may appropriately be . At this point he can refer to the list of " Purposes " since these normally summarize the intent of the steps to be developed and in turn suggest a logical method of approach . The purposes are not read or copied on the wall chart but should be restated in simple language the group can understand . ' In his introduction the leader should be sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he introduces . It may be necessary to spend a few minutes in getting a general agreement as to the meaning of words which at first glance may seem elemental . The " Discussion Plan " is then developed . In this outline three charts are to summarize the discussion . Specific suggestions are provided for the leader as to how he may promote the discussion . In the outline on cooperation a few type questions are suggested in this connection . After the need for cooperation in various situations has been informally discussed by the group , the leader suggests that it will be of interest to consider the evidences of poor cooperation and then proceeds to ask questions which will bring out the important points in Chart I. As these are suggested they are translated into neat phrases by the leader , using the language of the contributor if it is appropriate , and entered on a wall chart . After spending about fifteen minutes in developing Chart I the leader then suggests to the group that its members appear to be in agreement as to the evils of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point out that to correct any situation in which cooperation does not exist it will be necessary to find out what is wrong and what can be done about it . This paves the way for the introduction of Chart II dealing with what hinders cooperation and which has two sub-columns " Cause " and " Remedy . " Before passing to another chart the leader summarizes the high points brought out in the first chart and effects a smooth and graceful transition and introduction to the next chart . Chart II , it will be observed , suggests twenty-five reasons for the lack of cooperation and twenty-five related remedies , as a guide for the eader . Since it is important in the course of a single meeting devoted to this topic to provide an over-all picture of the problem , the leader suggests a quick listing of the causes on the left side of the chart . He then has the group take up.in turn each of the causes , or at least the more important ones , and , with specific illustrations or cases , agree upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be appropriately identified with its remedy the items arc numbered . After spending perhaps an hour in discussing the points suggested by Chart II , with particular emphasis on case material in developing  | the right side of the chart the leader interprets the group 's discussion in this connection , emphasizing those points which the group members have stressed . He then points ' out that Chart II has concerned itself with specific causes and remedies in some detail and suggests that it may next be appropriate for the group to agree on some general principles by which cooperation may be created . This will introduce Chart III , in the development and the charting of which the leader will have to take a more active direction of the formulation of chart entries than was the case in the second chart . After the more general principles involved in cooperation have been drawn out , the leader , a few minutes before the close of the meeting , summarizes or draws conclusions for the benefit of the group in such a way as to suggest that through its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value . At this point the leader may indicate to what extent the purposes of the discussion have been achieved . Just before the meeting breaks up he passes out the two pages of charts which have been duplicated for distribution . In the earlier stages of a discussion the leader takes the larger part in suggesting the problem and stimulating interest . As it proceeds his part generally grows smaller . The members then take hold of the problem , discuss it , and present cases . At the close the leader strikes directly to a conclusion . In the course of the discussion the leader keeps an eye on his watch and endeavors to time the various phases of the discussion so as to cover as much ground as possible within the time available . It will be noticed that the four steps in conference technique ( assembly , selection and evaluation of experience plus conclusions ) which were mentioned in Chapter II are followed , not for the discussion as a whole , but for each of the three charts . The discussion thereforereally serves to coordinate three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Where Can the Method Be Applied ? The basic principles set forth here can be used for training purposes in any fields of endeavor in which members of a discussion group possess common experience as related to the topics to be discussed . The discussion outlines in Part II , with a few changes in wording , can be applied to any organization ? industrial , commercial , institutional , or governmental . This follows because an effort has been made to assemble basic principles of supervision as applied anywhere rather than to restrict the material to practices peculiar to special lines of human endeavor . It will be possible , therefore , to use the discussion outlines as a guide or , pattern for groups of foremen engaged in manufacturing watches or wallpaper , shoes or ships , or supervisors of bookkeepers or bundle wrappers , stockmen or store managers . It is important , however , to remember that a deliberate effort must be made by  | the leader to see that the general principles set forth are illustrated by concrete cases from the field of work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II are designed to suggest basic principles in supervision rather than to serve as a guide in solving specific operating problems . Training in first principles should precede discussions conducted for the purpose of correcting unsatisfactory conditions or improving specific procedures or processes and at least a dozen meetings of supervisors should be conducted along the lines of the standard outlines in Part II before specialized problems are considered . The responses of members of groups employed in various lines of work and the phrases chosen for entry on the wall charts will naturally vary from those in the standard charts . The basic ideas developed will , however , be found to tally closely despite differences in trade terminology . Discussions of Technical Subject Matter The type of discussion outline here suggested can also be used to provide training in any technical or semitechnical subject matter in which a considerable number of group members have at least some elementary knowledge . Training of this kind is developmental in that it broadens the limited information of the trainees . It is possible , for example , for a discussion group to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be followed in such subjects as the use , maintenance , and operation of machines , the properties or processing of materials , making concrete , conveyor or other power transmission problems , and shoring and bracing trenches . The limited knowledge of the group may need to be implemented with technical facts supplied by the discussion leader or by an expert in the subject under discussion . In the presentation of topics concerned with practical operations in production or construction , reliance is placed not only on group discussion and the listing of important points on a wall chart but more particularly upon experiments and demonstrations conducted by members of the group under the direction of the leader . Thus in training a group of construction foremen in the making of concrete it is desirable to have them make up sample slabs of concrete using varying proportions of ingredients and curing them for different lengths of time ; these are then tested for strength in the conference room . Small models of machinery and equipment are invaluable in vocational training of this kind . Visual aids such as photographs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The extent to which any organization may be interested in providing training opportunities in improved methods , processing , or fabricating will naturally depend upon the extent of the supervisors ' knowledge at the time of employment , their subsequent opportunity to acquire information , and the extent to which new processes and lc ( hnicpu s are being developed it i the particular field in question .  | In the event that any specialized topics are needed to supplement the basic outlines here presented , the latter may be useful in suggesting the style and pattern to be followed in preparation . Special outlines may be needed in conducting meetings to decide , for example , on a new layout for machines and equipment , to discuss possible changes in methods , or difficulties encountered in processing , distribution , or sales . The Training-Within-Industry Program The basic concepts of " determinate discussion " as developed during the late thirties were in essence the foundation stones of the Federal T. W. I. program , initiated and used with such success in the training of foremen and supervisors during the second World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further in standardizing the free discussion conference . " , Job-Instructor-Training " was followed by " Job-MethodsTraining " and " Job-Relations-Training . " At the close of the war the directors of the Federal program , outstanding former executives in personnel and training , incorporated the T. W. I. Foundation as a non-profit organization. * This provides a service similar to that of the former war agency , for . supporting firms and other companies on a fee basis . The newest of the training programs offered is " Job-Economics-Training , " developed in response to the need for better understanding by supervisors of the operation of private competitive enterprises . The Training-Within-Industry courses were stereotyped in pattern and in method of administration . Little deviation ( except for case material ) was permitted for the exercise of individual initiative . The size of training groups was restricted to ten or not more than twelve , and visitors were taboo . Two-hour sessions were held on successive days , regardless of production schedules . Such straight-jacketing had never before appeared in the field of supervisor training . In the words of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was alleged that How to Train Supervisors went much too far in the controls it suggested but our own program carries determinate discussion to the nth degree . " As the proof of the pudding lies in the eating , so was Training Within Industry justified by its achievement . Hundreds of thousands of instructors and supervisors in industry and government have gone through its courses . Aside from the earlier Work Projects Administration , no agency has undertaken such mass training . Its influence on the industrial development of war workers was enormous . The " J " courses . were unquestionably the most important single educational factor responsible for , increased war production . Job-Instructor-Training ' I his intensive ten-hour course in how to instruct an individual Raining 1'itltin Imlu t 5 I.oumlaiinn , t 2 til , tin ; litl l . tt ? nt1c . . Summit , N.  | worker in new tasks is detailed in a 6o-page manual for trainers . An outline of the sessions is supported by extensive supplements dealing with putting the group at ease , the importance of training , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underwriter 's knot , and with special problems . A summary of the standard 10-hour Job-Instructor-Training plan is as follows : JOB-INSTRUCTOR-TRAINING First Session ? 2 hours . Introduction . Importance of training to production .

( Selection of 2 volunteers for the next session . ) Second Session ? 2 hours . First Hour . Two volunteer " instructing " demonstrations , to bring out the NEED for the four things an instructor must do to " get ready . " Second Hour . Practice in making job breakdowns of : ( a ) The underwriter 's knot . ( b ) The two jobs presented during the first hour . ( c ) One or two additional jobs if time permits .

Practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? 2 hours . i ? hours of practice instruction demonstrations . Last I hour , Conclusion and Summary . ( a ) Questions . ( b ) Importance of good Job Instruction to production . ( c ) Necessity of using the Job Instructor Training Plan . ADHERE STRICTLY TO THIS PLAN DO NOT DEPART FROM IT OR CHANGE IT The essence of the principles of instruction is printed on small cards distributed to each trainee for his reference in breaking in new employees , as follows : figure  | figure Emphasis is placed on a time table or training progress chart showing for any foreman how much skill each of his workers should have by a specified date . Each trainee is required to make up such a table for his own subordinates . Practice is also insisted on in breaking down a job into its elements for instructional purposes . The following form heading is used in this connection : figure  | After two years of experience with the J-I-T course it was supplemented by a follow-through plan for coaching supervisors who had taken the course : this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been given but had not been used to any extent . This plan provides a six-hour session with job instructors and supervisors in which the J-I-T course and its aims are reviewed and instructions given for the trainer in coaching job instructors and supervisors individually . Job-Methods-Training The success of job instructor training brought requests for additional training material from industrial leaders who realized that teaching was only one aspect of good supervision . The principles of how to instruct could be set down concisely and adapted readily to most any teaching situation or line of industry . When it came to the broader field of effecting improvements in operating procedures and in industrial relations within a multitude of diversified industries , Training Within Industry could obviously not set forth a training content rigidly detailed in all respects . Considerably more discussion from the group was needed to supply the actual case material on which the training must depend . The simplest possible abstract formulae for solving problems in methods and human relations were therefore incorporated in discussion outlines , using a format similar to that of J-I-T . Job-Methods-Training provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of materials , machines , and manpower . It is designed to deliver greater quantities of quality products in less time . Intelligently presented it enables each trainee to streamline his job and effect improvements in product and processing . During the course he is required to present a specific plan or suggestion for saving time , effort or material , improving quality , service , or appearance of the product . After his presentation , members of the group analyze and criticize the proposal . Results far greater than any attained under a suggestion system are reported by hundreds of business firms who have taken up J-M-T . In many cases , appropriate rewards are given for money-saving suggestions . The steps to be followed ? the prescription worked up for use in any situation in which improved methods are desired ? are summarized in the following abstract from J-M-T training material : STEP I. Break Down the job . i . List all details of the job exactly as done by the present method . 2 . Be sure details include all : ( a ) Material Handling ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take any job ? take the first one you see in your department .  | ? just " start right in " ? jot down on a sheet of paper every detail as it happens . Do this right at the job . Do n't try to do it back at your desk . You 'll overlook something if you do . ? do n't be secretive or mysterious about it . Tell your workers what you are doing . Be frank and open about the listing of details . STEP II . Question every detail . 1 . Use these types of questions : Why is it necessary ? What is its purpose ? Where should it be done ? When should it be done ? Who is best qualified to do it ? How is " the best way " to do it ? 2 . Also question the : Materials , Machines , Equipment , Tools , Product , Design , Layout , Work Place , Safety , Housekeeping . ? just start down your sheet of details . Start questioning each one . ? you wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you . ? perhaps a " BETTER WAY " will " flash " into your mind . Hold this " new idea " temporarily and question EVERY DETAIL on your list before you start to " dope out " the better way . If you stop to work it out , you may help only a part of the job , and overlook a broader or more useful improvement . ? do n't expect to find some improvement in EVERY job the first time you question the details . STEP III . Develop the new method . 1 . Eliminate unnecessary details . 2 . Combine details when practical . 3 . Rearrange for better sequence . 4 . Simplify all necessary details . ( a ) Make the work easier and safer . ( b ) Pre-position materials , tools , and equipment at the best places in the proper work area . ( c ) Use gravity-feed hoppers and drop-delivery chutes when practical . ( d ) Let both hands do useful work . ( e ) Use jigs and fixtures instead of hands , for holding work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 . Write up your proposed new'method. ? eliminating unnecessary details prevents waste of materials and manpower . ? combining and rearranging overcome " back tracking " and double handling . ? simplifying makes the job easier and safer to do . ? be sure to get all those affected " in on " your idea from the start . Do n't work out the new method and " spring it " on your people . This applies to your boss , your associates , and particularly to your own workers . The best way of all is to work out your idea with them . Make them a part of it .  | STEP IV . Apply the new method . i . Sell your proposal to the boss . 2 . Sell the new method to the operators . 3 . Get final approval of all concerned on Safety , Quality , Quantity , Cost . 4 . Put the new method to work . Use it until a better way is developed . 5 . Give credit where credit is due . ? remember , today 's best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a better way ? and you will work it out ! ? stealing an idea is really a form of sabotage . Be open-minded to suggestions , even if many of them are " wild ideas . " A really good one may come along . Job-Relations-Training The course in supervisor-employee relationships , also a ten-hour program , undertakes to solve case problems and demonstrate that the human approach is also the approach which gets maximum production . Each member of the group presents a specific problem which is analyzed and discussed by the conference in accordance with a standard formula . This is much the same as the long used formula for conference procedure which appears on page 14 . The J-R-T program has proved interesting and valuable , particularly in those organizations that have never undertaken foremanship training in human relations . It succeeded best in those situations where a wide variety of case material was supplied ; in others , the cases merely repeated each other and became monotonous . The technique used in the course is useful to a discussion leader at any time that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which his group has not yet agreed . Since only five sessions are conducted the course can not be expected to have either the value or the variety of a longer program which devotes one or two meetings to a more specific subject . An outline of the course is as follows : figure  | figure With minor changes intelligently made by training directors , the T. W. I. material can be effectively woven into a discussion course similar to that suggested in Part II of How to Train Supervisors . The sessions should be conducted by the company 's own discussion leaders and followed through to guarantee results . J-I-T may be used in place of most of Outlines i8 and 19 to provide more thorough practice in job instruction ; a discussion group of twenty should be halved for this purpose . J-M-T can be substituted for most of Outline 26 if longer training in methods is desired . The fob Relations technique can be used to advantage in supplementing training in that field , but should be fortified by special cases selected in advance from the experience of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Confidence of the Group Confidence is an attitude of mind . Rather than being a fixed or permanent attitude it may change quickly as a result of relatively unimportant occurrences . It is ordinarily built up slowly as a result of acquaintanceship . In order for a discussion leader to secure beneficial results it is necessary for him to build up the confidence of the group as quickly as possible . At the outset he needs to make it clear that he is not there as a teacher or because he knows more than its members do . His prestige depends not upon posing as an authority or " blowing his own horn " but upon showing the group that he can tactfully steer and guide its discussion and assist them in understanding the significance of the points discussed without dominating or forcing his own ideas . As a matter of operating tactics the only thing that a leader can do is to so conduct himself that his group believes in him . He must not appear in any way different from what he actually is . Some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leader 's job is to find out how competent they are , to act as a detective and report unfavorable attitudes or conditions to the management . Such a misunderstanding must be cleared up at once . If an initial distrust is apparent , and this may be perfectly natural when the leader meets for the first time with a group of supervisors , he must appear to be totally unaware of any distrust and simply go at his job . From the very start members of the group should be advised that their discussions are " privileged ' ' in that any member may say what he pleases without being criticised by the management . It should be understood that neither the leader nor any group member is to carry any tales ; the group should itself endeavor to correct bad conditions , preferably without involving administrative action . The Leader 's Attitude Towards the Group The leader 's attitude should not be superior , paternal , or patronizing . Ile can not place himself on a pedestal ; he must be one of the group . He should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group : 3r )  | discussion , not a monologue . He must refrain from taking the attitude of a school teacher who has a lesson to put over . Nor must he take the position of a preacher exhorting the group members to righteousness . In addressing those present he should be neither too formal nor too familiar : He should avoid the salutation of " friend . " In referring to an individual it is better to refer to him as " Mr. Jones , " " Jones , ' " or " Charlie . " In addressing a general question to the group he may refer to them as " men . " At times the expression " group " may be used but the term is easily overworked . The leader should dodge the use of the pronoun " I " and refrain from talking too much about his own experience . In referring to conclusions arrived at , even though he may have contributed a good deal to them , he can use the pronouns " you " and " we . " Instead of saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have said that , etc . " It assists him greatly if he deliberately credits others in the group for good points even though he may have initiated the ideas in the first place . Expressions such as " class , lesson , teacher , training , and manual " should be taboo . Aside from selling himself to the group in the course of his contacts with it , a useful method of winning the confidence of individual members is to become better acquainted with them outside of the discussion periods . A leader who is privileged to drop in and chat occasionally with members of his group while at work gets better acquainted with them and gains their respect . A Code of Ethics In his relations with the discussion group the leader will soon come to appreciate the need for a code of ethics to meet the many delicate situations which confront him . The Trade and Industrial Education Service of the U. S. Office of Education suggests most of the following items : i . A leader must be absolutely square and fair minded . 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privileged " so far as both he and the group members are concerned . 3 . A leader must have a " convenient forgetfulness " with reference to names of critical members . 4 . Legitimate requests for information should be satisfied , if possible , at proper time and in proper manner . 5 . Grievances may be thrashed out thoroughly in the conference and possibly settled there , but the details of discussion should not be revealed outside . 6 . A leader should guard against being " pumped " as to " privileged " details of discussion , individuals , etc. 7 . A leader should not give advice as to relative standing or ability of the men on the basis of their performance in a conference . His viewpoint is too inadequate for determining their possible qualifications for promotion or dismissal .  | 8 . Discussion should not be permitted to run along lines which will tend to set the men at variance with those directing their work . Holding the Group 's Interest Once the leader has obtained the confidence of the group his success depends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a discussion series the problem of stimulating interest may be more important than it is later on . There are , of course , definite evidences of lack of interest . These are characterized by too much discussion of a boisterous or irrelevant nature or too little discussion when hardly anyone says anything . - A lack of interest may be due to the fact that the topic does not meet the practical needs of the group or because its members have had so little experience with the subject that they hesitate to discuss it . A subject may not quite seem to fit the group 's needs because the leader has not . taken pains to adjust it to their needs . The group may not be in the mood to settle down to serious discussion because the leader has not been able to convince them of the value of the meetings . Failure on the part of superior officers to back up a training program may also make it difficult to sustain interest . A lack of interest may become apparent if a certain aspect of a discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand pat " on a topic which lags or meets with opposition . It is necessary to change the immediate trend of the topic when its possibilities have been exhausted or when the matter discussed may , for one reason or another , be regarded as lacking in interest . Under these conditions it is usually necessary to push along to a subsequent aspect of the subject . If the discussion lags the chances are ten to one that the leader has failed to make the topic clear or to liven it with adequate illustrations . When interest has lagged in any discussion the first step is for the leader to determine just why it lagged and what he could have done to stimulate it . The Need for Mental Agility Quickness in apperception and in determining a course of action as points are offered from the floor are traits which a leader needs to have . Half a dozen suggestions or ideas may be offered at once and he must promptly select the appropriate ones , disregard those that are beside the point , and endeavor to have the pertinent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must appear not to have heard a suggestion which is beside the point ; there are times when he does not appear to see a man trying to get attention . He will have to learn how " to back-peddle , side-step , duck and dodge , " as a veteran conference leader once described it . The leader must endeavor to think a little ahead of his group . He needs to anticipate the trend which the discussion is taking and try  | to keep it from being sidetracked from its main objective . On the other hand he must avoid short circuiting the thinking of the group . The leader 's mind may be so active that he assumes that members of the group have arrived at the same conclusion as himself . He may take understanding for granted when such is not the case . At times he may be tempted to give his interpretation of the facts prematurely or wine up a discussion as he sees it rather than to have the men work out the problem for themselves . This should , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the extent that each member of the group participates effectively in it , not once , but several times . Various situations may arise in connection with the leader 's effort to get everyone to participate . Certain individuals may hesitate to express themselves , one or more men may seek to dominate the discussion and " run the whole show . " If the leader feels that the discussion is not well distributed he may ask a member of the group to sit in the rear of the room and keep a record of the contributions made . This man should make up a list of the men present , arranged in order of their seating arrangement . To the right the record sheet should carry column headings to indicate the various types of responses . Appropriate headings may be " Voluntary Suggestion , " " Answered Overhead Question , " " Answered Direct Question , " etc . Tally or check marks are then entered in the appropriate columns opposite the name of each man as he talks . The distribution of responses may be most enlightening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some men never enter into the discussion and in others that a few members are responsible for more than half of all the contributions . Having determined the causes for a lack of uniformly distributed discussion the leader may then take appropriate action . For those men who are not participating he may throw out a case or question which he knows is of particular interest to them or he may address them with a direct question . Shy or reticent members of the group require special attention and considerable effort needs to be made to bring them more actively into the discussion . When they are contacted outside of the meetings in a friendly personal way they can often be encouraged to participate more freely . Throwing Questions Back to the Group If there is a cardinal principle in leading discussion it is that the leader shall not personally answer any question which can be answered by a member of the group . It is a common tendency for an inexperienced leader at once to express his own opinion in reply to a question asked . His invariable rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulate the thinking of those in the group . If a man asks a ques-  | Lion the leader should throw it back by asking him for his own opinion and then asking for the opinions of other members . Only as a last resort and in the event that the leader has information regarding administrative policies or procedures which can not be supplied by members of the group should he supply factual information . This does not of course apply to having him cite interesting cases or to defining or interpreting the thinking of the group . As soon as the leader begins to answer questions himself he turns " professor " and ceases to be a discussion leader . On rare occasions the leader may anticipate difficulty in getting a discussion underway and may find it desirable to go to one or two members in advance of the meeting and suggest that they present certain points of view in the course of the discussion . He may suggest that they cite cases , ask certain questions , or start a friendly argument by taking a contrary point of view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be very careful in using any " stooges . " He must be well acquainted with them personally in order that his motive may not be misunderstood . Injecting a Dash of Humor Training discussions are likely to be too dry and serious . In order to sustain interest and stimulate the thinking of the group an occasional bit of humor is most helpful . It is possible to open a meeting by relating an amusing incident . A good story can also be used in the course of discussion to revive flagging interest or to smooth over arguments which become too heated . The introduction of a dash of humor is in the nature of a sauce or condiment to the more serious aspects of the discussion . It is important to select stories which are directly applicable to the point under consideration and to refrain from the telling of yarns which , instead of being subtle , are merely dirty . The use of humorous anecdotes also needs watching in that it may encourage others in the group to start telling funny stories as a result of which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there arc one or two good-natured individuals on whom wisecracks can occasionally be pulled or to whom the leader may direct a question with the expectation that the answer will be couched in an amusing manner . Making an individual the butt of goodnatured fun must be done with due caution in order that he may not resent it . The leader therefore needs to know the characteristics of members of the group in order to determine how far he may go in this connection . The Need for Talking the Language of the Group Obviously the leader needs to talk the foreman 's language . There is always danger that he may shoot over the heads of his group , particularly when dealing with supervisors having little education . The  | simpler the language used the better . Most supervisors in industry are men whose vocabulary is small because their reading is restricted to a local newspaper and a popular weekly . Involved academic discussion of subject matter is not grasped by practical workmen who think in terms of concrete specific applications of what has happened to them . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average industrial group , more so than the white-collar group , can not express or define ideas except in specific terms . An illustration of this point is seen in the case of the Italian foreman who was asked what he meant by " loyalty " ; he said : " I ca n't put ' em in words but if I say to O'Brien : Joe I meet you tomorrow eight o'clock corner Canal and Bank Street ! ' He say O.K. , I say O.K. He 's there . I 'm there . That 's loyalty . " Avoiding " Word Trouble " Abstract words usually have many variations in meaning . Terms which are applied to material objects are usually understood by a conference group . Examples are " caliper , " " reamer , " " carpenter 's square , " " cement " ; these have a narrow and specific meaning ? but what of " morale , " " prestige , " " coordination , " " cooperation ? " The common word " institution " is a case in point . To an abstract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; to a bookkeeper it may signify the bank where he works ; to an attorney it may mean a corporate body ; to an orphan it suggests a foundling 's home ; to a delinquent , a prison . The leader who is interested in the relations of words to realities is referred to Stuart Chase 's Tyranny of Words for an analysis of the difficulties which we all have in understanding each other . As Mr. Chase aptly remarks elsewhere : " A business conference , the Congressional Record , a meeting of the Board of Education , the proceedings of almost any annual convention , a get-together of pacifists , of the Daughters of the American Revolution , of communists , of delegates to the American Federation of Labor , a banquet of the Bar Association ? words , words , words , making blab , sense , blab , blab , sense , blab ; a thin white flicker of meaning on a broad black band . " Such " word trouble " can generally be avoided if the leader prepares himself in advance to supply appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases rather than accepting a loose expression of half-baked opinion by members of the group . It is frequently necessary for the leader to define abstract terms used in the discussion so as to facilitate mutual understanding . He needs a vocabulary of more than average size and should be well acquainted with the meaning of words in common use . He may find that such simple terms as " cause " . and " effect " require definition . He will do well to make extensive use of a dictionary and to look up and write out the meanings of key words to be used in a new topic . " The use of Roget 's  | Thesaurus will also be helpful . This does not , of course , imply that the leader should show off his vocabulary . On the contrary , to the extent that he can use popular or slang phrases in interpreting the ideas of the group the more successful will be his leadership . If he deals with foreign language groups it is definitely helpful to him to know something of the language involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group discussion will therefore succeed in direct proportion to the extent to which the leader keeps it on a concrete rather than an abstract basis . Whenever the discussion becomes vague or philosophical , it loses its effect . Generalities should be shunned and every effort made to drive the discussion through to practical conclusions and applications . If the leader permits the group to wander off and discuss abstract generalities or matters of opinion , the group , which is accustomed to thinking largely in terms of practical experience , will have difficulty in remembering and applying the conclusions derived . The Use of Specific Case Material Constructive thinking on the part of a discussion group can not be achieved unless it has depth . The thinking of the group must be logical and thoroughgoing . A major criticism of many conferences is their superficiality . The leader 's own thinking processes , usually because of inadequate advance preparation , may be hazy and he thereupon permits members of the group to suggest a variety of halforganized ideas on which loose conclusions are formed . A great deal of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , commented on in the previous section , the meaning of which has not been clarified by specific illustrations . If the leader constantly strives to pull out concrete illustrations , or cases as they may be called , and seeks to have the members of the group explain what prompted them to suggest the points under discussion , those points will be understood and remembered . It is , therefore , all important to keep the discussion down to " brass tacks . " In using the word " case , " the term is somewhat comparable to the case histories used in the case study method in teaching law , medicine , social work , and psychology . A case in a supervisors ' discussion however is generally brief and to the point or should be made so in order to restrict its application to the immediate point under discussion . In this sense a case is any personal experience , current or past , which can be specifically described by a member of the group . It may be something ( i ) which happened to him or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) heard , or ( 4 ) read about . A case is of value in the order of those situations . Case material need not be restricted to the current work experience of members of the group ; any pertinent situation experienced at any time in the lifc'of a group member may be in order . An actual case is much more effective than a hypothetical one . When a cc , nference  | member says , " Supposing such-and-such is the case , " that supplies an invitation for others to make other and different suppositions and the thinking of the group is further confused . It is therefore desirable to insist on the presentation of experience which can be narrated in specific detail because it is first-hand personal experience . Specific illustrations may be offered at times by the leader himself , especially when he seeks to have members of the group bring out their experience . Of greater importance , however , is the need for the leader to have the group members cite such of their own experience as definitely illustrates the more general or abstract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A few self-evident points may of course be accepted for entry on a chart without having them backed up by specific cases . The great majority of the points should be illustrated , reinforced , and made clear by specific illustrations . The introduction of case material definitely slows up the progress of a discussion but makes it interesting and practical . It is possible to go through a discussion such as that on " Making Cooperation Effective " and develop an excellent listing of points in forty-five minutes . However , the discussion and the conclusions will not be retained by members of the group for any length of time since the points have not been graphically supported with case material . Such a meeting is in effect a word-guessing game . When a leader presents a case of his own it is frequently well for him to withhold certain important points in presenting it and then get the group to appreciate that they need to have all the information before a diagnosis can be made . Such a technique stimulates thinking since it promotes an attitude of inquiry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to direct the discussion into channels which will enable the group to draw the proper conclusion based upon possession of all the facts involved . Summarizing and Closing a Discussion It will be obvious that the leader who looked at his watch when the time had come to close a meeting and then wrote " good night " on the wall chart failed to complete his job . At the close of each discussion there is a definite need for driving home the important points discussed in order that the objectives of the discussion may be clinched . Cutting a live discussion off arbitrarily leaves the topic hanging in midair and fails to impress the group that it has accomplished anything of consequence . A discussion needs to be brought to a focus and polished off , so to speak , in a smooth and logical fashion . Nothing is accomplished in this connection by merely having the leader re-read the entries on the wall chart at which the group has been looking throughout , the discussion . An appropriate summary should he planned iii advance and should  | cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scope of the discussion or the ground covered ; ( 2 ) it should call attention to the more important conclusions which the group has reached ; ( 3 ) it may mention outstanding cases of interest cited , and ( 4 ) it needs to interpret the significance of the discussion and suggest its application to the daily work of the group . Leaders may unfortunately revert to an opinionated lecture method in summarizing . They sometimes conclude with a kind of preaching attitude and use such expressions as " I think you should do so and so . " They should summarize by using such terms as " you agreed " or " you suggested , " placing the emphasis on the fact that the group itself developed certain ideas . The leader rarely needs to inject new ideas which have not been brought out in the discussion . He should avoid questions , aside from rhetorical ones , since they are likely to reopen the discussion . Group members should leave the meeting room feeling that they have derived something worthwhile from the discussion . Their interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informally after the meeting has broken up . An excellent indicator of interest is the " curbstone " discussion which sometimes lingers on outside the meeting place for a considerable time after adjournment . Before dismissing the group the discussion leader should announce the topic for the next meeting , . encourage the group to be thinking of pertinent problems and questions in the meantime , and suggest that its members come prepared to cite cases of interest . With certain groups of supervisors it is most helpful to stimulate their thinking in advance of the discussion of a given topic by passing out a list of questions at the close of the preceding meeting . In this connection some of the questions which the leader proposes to use in chart development may be duplicated . Members of the group are asked to think over the points raised and to come prepared to cite interesting cases and individual problems . At times it is also valuable to suggest reading references which have a bearing on the next topic . This procedure is usually restricted to groups of higher mental caliber ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to study a topic in advance . Putting the Group 's Conclusions to Work The interest of members of a discussion group is not sustained over a period of time unless those in attendance observe that their meetings axe achieving results . Supervisors in industry and construction are practical men accustomed to judge results by what they can see . Unless they can apply the ideas developed in their discussions in their daily work , observe others trying them out , and unless some of the possible improvements in methods and procedure which they suggest are  | carried out by the management , they will be unwilling to continue in discussions in which they merely talk but get nowhere . Conclusions drawn and suggestions made by discussion groups are of two types . The first is of a general nature and involves a gradual change in attitude , habits , and thinking on the part of members of the group . The second includes those discussions which require specific action and which are intended to correct unsatisfactory conditions . Changes in attitude and habits in matters of discipline , taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place almost unconsciously in the supervisors in the course of their daily contacts with the working force . After discussing a series of topics dealing with human relations they tend to try out or apply the general conclusions reached . They may also experiment with specific procedures which have been suggested by others . They may thus improve their planning , their placement of workers , and their making of reports . Such results of a discussion are more readily observed than are gradual changes in attitude . Many suggestions grow out of group discussion , however , which can not be applied by the supervisors themselves . The management must be consulted . For example , if changes are suggested in the content of report forms or in procedure , in hiring policies , or in labor relations , the discussion of the group must be reported to the proper executives for authorization or action . This is especially the case when a special conference is called to consider possible action in connection with an operating problem and the discussion follows a special rather than a standard outline . Facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of group discussion should not be called to the attention of the management unless the group definitely places itself on record to this effect . The group may approve having the leader submit certain questions to the management merely in the way of a request for information . It may go further and suggest specific recommendations for improvement . Such ideas growing out of discussion are frequently of great value to executives who otherwise have no other means of knowing that certain conditions exist . The management should consider the questions or suggestions made and send a written communication or reply to the group at a subsequent meeting . It is frequently more desirable for the executive concerned to appear at the following meeting and discuss the matter at issue for a few minutes with the group . The management naturally needs to support the training program and give serious consideration to the questions raised . Queries should be promptly answered and if a course of action suggested by the group is not feasible its members should be told why . Some discussion groups have found it helpful to appoint a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by its own members of conclu-  | sions agreed to . Such a committee may report to the group in instances of apparent violation of agreements reached : The leader needs to devise some simple method of reporting such discussion points as the group wishes to submit to the management . A memorandum describing the condition and problem drafted by the leader should contain specific facts as to names , dates , numbers , etc. , so that the management may have sufficient information to analyze and act upon the matter . Discussion Leadership Analyzed A concise breakdown of the leader 's functions follows . This may serve to provide an over-all picture of just what a discussion leader does when he meets with a conference group and will be found of study and reference value . The job analysis is based on a similar one made by N. B. Giles , Federal Agent for the U. S. Office of Education but is adapted to the needs of determinate discussion rather than a less formal type of conference . figure  | THE TECHNIQUE OF CONTROL When an eager group meets to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than to control the discussion . Discussions once started may go out of bounds . Methods of discussion control take on added significance in the case of determinate discussion , in which factors of time and scope demand the exercise of special skill . Some of the techniques which may be used to meet the problems of controlling the discussion are here considered . Side-Tracks and Side-Discussions The problem of regaining attention when the men are talking about all sorts of things , " kidding " each other , laughing , joking and telling stories or engaging in overheated arguments , is a difficult one . The leader needs to act energetically . At times a friendly appeal to the group to settle down to business may succeed . The leader can frequently thrust himself into the forefront of the discussion and cite a live case or illustration which will center attention on the point under discussion . By merely pointing silently to an item on the wall chart the leader is often able to redirect attention to the topic . He may call for a statement from a level-headed thinker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If too many suggestions are forthcoming at once the suggestion " let 's take these one at a time " may slow the discussion down . On rare occasions a meeting may become too turbulent and the leader may call a brief recess . In the normal course of a well-directed , two-hour session , however , recess pauses are not usually necessary or desirable . A common problem of leadership is that of controlling side discussions in which , at various points in the room , several men have their heads together . Frequently such offside discussions are stopped when the leader glances toward or , better still , walks over to the men involved . On other occasions he may address a direct question : " What do you think about that , Mr. Jones ? " to one of the talkers . Ordinarily the man addressed admits that he has not been listening and group attention is once more centered on the discussion . Another device is 48  | for the leader to say to a man holding a private conversation : " You seem to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it ? " Talkative Group Members In nearly every group there are one or more men who talk too much . Frequently they seek to dominate the discussion . They may be inclined to show off or have an exaggerated idea of their own importance . At times it may be possible to ignore the glib talker by deliberately disregarding him . On the other hand it is all too easy for the leader to rely upon one or more talkative persons with ideas to keep the discussion moving . Without becoming aware of it he may be conducting a dialogue with one or two members with the rest of the group merely listening in . The cocky individual or the man who admits he knows it all may at times be squelched by forcing him to justify his statements if they are far-fetched . Through clever questioning the leader may force him to take an extreme position . Then , when he is out on a limb , some other member of the group ( but not the leader ) will saw it off . There are other members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make ; because of their genuine interest they are likely to contribute too much . The leader may talk with such an individual outside of the meeting , tell him that he is far ahead of the group in his thinking and ask him to withhold his comments until others have had an opportunity to contribute . A device which sometimes makes for a more equitable participation is for the leader to state the case to the group in arithmetical terms . He may call attention to the fact that a group has one hundred and twenty minutes for its discussion and that since twenty men are present this allows only six minutes per man , if every one takes part . This may quiet some of the over-talkative members . If the leader has caused an analysis to be made of the frequency of contributions as previously suggested he can report the figures to the group without mentioning names . In one conference visited it was found that one man spoke one hundred and thirty times whereas most of the others who participated spoke less than twenty times . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader may bluntly ask him to give the other men a chance . Handling Contrary Individuals Particularly at the outset of a discussion series the leader may meet with individuals in the group who object to almost every point that is raised in the discussion . This negative attitude on the part of the " I am against " person frequently presents a difficult problem . Some individuals who insist that things ca n't be done are most voluble in their attitude and may retard the progress of the discussion . They may possibly be handled in the same manner as others in the  | group who just talk too much . It may also be possible to open the closed mind of such a man by showing him that a majority of the group disagrees with him . He may develop a more reasonable attitude if he comes to realize that he is generally on the other side of the fence . This is one occasion on which the calling of a majority vote by the raising of hands may be appropriate . The stubborn or obstinate man who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sits in the meeting without voicing his thoughts is another problem type . Both the noisy and quiet objector can frequently be mellowed in the course of personal acquaintanceship , by having the leader become better acquainted with them . The leader can often make a start in the direction of breaking down an individual 's resistance if he can obtain agreement on minor points at the outset . This is an important point stressed in salesmanship since it is desirable to have a sales prospect say " yes " rather than " no . " The successful leader will ask questions with which even the most argumentative man will have to agree . When one admission after another is obtained the contrary individual finds himself embracing a conclusion he would have otherwise denied . When once a man says " no " his personal pride demands that he stick to it . Another point for the leader to remember in connection with members of his group , particularly its obstinate members , is that the only way to win an argument is to avoid it . As soon as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the group to get into a bitter argument with him , it is difficult to get him to change his opinion because he does not wish to be convinced against his will . No man likes to be shown up as being in the wrong . The leader must always give the objector an opportunity to save his face and must frequently go out of his way to give him credit for good ideas or lose his goodwill . He must show respect for the other man 's opinions rather than flatly tell him that he is wrong . Embarrassing or Controversial Questions Despite the efforts of the leader to avoid them , there are occasions when members of this group will inject controversial or touchy subjects or questions . These may involve the criticism of individuals , possibly within the group itself , or imply criticisms of executive or administrative policies . There may be a sidetrack on religion , politics , or unionization . Whenever a situation of this kind arises the leader must face it and decide whether or not it is to be allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloves in order not to antagonize either the management or members of the group . If personalities are involved he must firmly insist that they be avoided and that names be not mentioned . Intelligent criticism and suggestions regarding policies , system , or procedures may he perfectly in order provided they are in line with  | the topic under discussion . If not , it may be possible for the leader to suggest that the question raised be taken up at a later time when the subject is considered . There are certain situations in which embarrassment to the management can be avoided if he simply states that he feels it beyond the limits of appropriate discussion by the group . If he permits the discussion to go ahead he must be absolutely fair and square to all concerned . When members of the group engage in an argument which tends to become personal the leader may step in and inject a touch of humor . The leader may calm the men in question by asking with a smile : " If you men want to put on the gloves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step outside . " Free discussion of a critical point may sometimes be obtained by introducing a hypothetical situation similar to that actually existing . If there is feeling , for example , between two departments in a plant , one of which is slow in making deliveries to the second , thereby disrupting the work schedule , the leader may suggest an imaginary and similar situation in another plant . In this way he can get a calm and rational discussion of the principles involved without having the members of the group indulge in personalities . Any friction which may exist among members of the group and among the divisions of an organization is generally eliminated as the conference series proceeds . In the course of their discussions the supervisors tend more and more , to avoid personalities and to appreciate the fact that profitable discussion must be a matter of give and take . They gradually become more tolerant of the viewpoint of others . The Use of Questions The leader 's primary job is to promote discussion . Since this is done more particularly through questioning members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will bring results . There is more than a little to the art of asking questions , particularly leading questions , and considerable practice is required of every person who hopes to stimulate constructive group thinking . No less important is the use of questions which will keep the discussion on the right track . Questions which may be answered " Yes " or " No " have very little use in discussion excepting when they are used in a rhetorical sense , for emphasis , rather than in expecting an answer . The simplest suggestion to leaders as to how questions for conference work should be phrased is conveyed by a paragraph from Rudyard Kipling 's " The Elephant 's Child " : " I keep six honest serving men , ( They taught me all I knew ) Their names are what and why and when , And how and where and who. "  | If the six serving men are borne in mind the leader will have far less trouble in bringing out discussion . The use of " Yes " and " No " questions should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be called ( I ) Overhead or general questions and ( 2 ) Direct questions . As a rule it is first best to use overhead questions thrown out to the entire discussion group . This applies at the beginning of a conference and also when the leader is trying to get initial suggestions to start a list of items on a chart . A general question thrown out at random causes all members of the group to think ; a response may come from anyone . If a question or two addressed to the group at large brings out no reply the leader may then throw his question more directly to part of the group , addressing it to two or three persons sitting close together . This may bring a response from one of the individuals in question . If difficulty is still experienced , the leader may as a last resort direct a question to a specific individual in the group . However , unless he knows that the member addressed has ideas on the subject the latter may have nothing to say . A direct question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point . The leader therefore needs to use direct questions with care . It is particularly poor form to go from one group member to the next in asking direct questions since this at once transforms the meeting into a schoolroom . In asking them it is important to state the question first before mentioning the man 's name . If an individual 's name is mentioned first the rest of the group may not give any thought to the question . If such questions become necessary , it is also good practice to direct questions to retiring members of the group first , rather than the more forward persons . The latter will speak for themselves . Questions need to be clearly and precisely stated and frequently require advance preparation . In introducing a chart such as the one on " What Hinders Effective Cooperation " in the outline considered in Chapter III , it is not enough to ask " What hinders effective cooperation ? " and expect the group to respond . The leader needs to restate and rephrase his basic objective using different words so that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to go further and ask : " In your experience what are some of the causes of poor cooperation ? What are some of the reasons why men fail to pull together ? How can we indicate those conditions within us or within the organization which hinder cooperation ? " Some discussion leaders are apt to be so full of their subject that they keep on asking questions without giving members of the group a chance to reply . A barrage of questions of this kind should not be thrown at the group , one right after another . A moment 's pause is needed between them to give the group members an opportunity to think and to phrase replies . In developing a list of chart points such as the chart on cooperation referred to it is very easy to ' get into the habit of saying " All right ,  | what next ? " or " Anything else ? " Such questions tend to become very monotonous to the group and are apt to center attention on a mere listing of words rather than on case material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be tied in with the topic under consideration . Instead of vaguely asking " Next ? " the leader could ask , for example : " What are some of the other factors that prevent our getting cooperation ? " An illustration of the result of asking questions in a loose manner is shown by a leader who was developing remedies for eliminating idle time . He ran down the list of causes on the left side of the chart asking again and again : " What will we do about this ? " He came to the entry " Hangover " as a cause of lost time and asked his stock question . From the back of the room came the prompt response : " Take Bromo-Seltzer . " Suggestive Questions The use of leading or suggestive questions which start the minds of group members in the direction of a proper response is necessary in promoting group thinking . This type of question is particularly helpful in trying to provoke an idea which has not been volunteered by the group and which the leader believes should be brought out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard chart which he is using as a guide . Leading questions range from one which merely gives the desired response away , to one which merely starts the thinking process and may need to be followed up with three or four more questions before the answer sought is supplied . In bringing out " Broken Promises " as one of the causes that prevent cooperation , for example , it is of no value for the leader bluntly to ask : " Do broken promises hinder cooperation ? " since such a question is answered with the word " Yes " and provokes no discussion . The leader might bring the point out in a roundabout way by saying : " If you buy some razor blades which are guaranteed to give you twenty shaves and you find you can actually use them for only ten , how has your attitude changed with reference to the manufacturer ? " ( Answer ? lost faith in his product . ) " If the men we work with lose faith in what we tell them what is their attitude ? Are they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes fail to do that causes his men- to lose faith in him ? " ( Answer ? does n't keep his word . ) " Would you then suggest that broken promises should be listed as one of the causes of poor cooperation ? " It should be noted that precise wording is essential for leading questions in order that the desired response may be forthcoming . Very small changes in the above illustration might have shunted the group 's thinking to a final response of " conflicting orders , lack of recognition . or passing the buck . " A simpler illustration of a more direct method of getting a specific response desired is this : " In what way , if any , does the type of discipline  | to which a supervisor resorts affect the cooperation he gets ? " The response of " hard-boiled supervision " may come forth at once or if not the leader could add a second question : " What kind of discipline makes loyal teamwork difficult to achieve ? " Suggestive questions take time in a discussion since more than one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal of time in preparation . These considerations do not , however , preclude their necessity . In every one of the standard charts in Part II there are ideas which are brought out with difficulty and which may require the use of leading questions . For each of these points the leader in the course of his preparation needs to write out in detail the precise wording which will provoke the response sought . The amount of work involved in developing such questions is probably the reason why they are not more commonly used . There may be an inclination on the part of the leader to dodge this task , necessary as it frequently is . In introducing many topics it is helpful to take up the negative side of the question first . This is a useful device based on a psychological trait of the human mind . It is sometimes easier to think of things that are wrong than things that are right . It would be found difficult , for example , to gain a ready response to the question " How can cooperation be improved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative side is considered and the group is asked to bring out what prevents cooperation a livelier discussion ensues . Similarly , if difficulty is encountered by the leader in introducing any other subject he may start his questions with the negative viewpoint but after doing so he needs to work through to the positive point of view . The Distribution of Time If a training program is to be conducted in a systematic manner a definite time period for each topic , frequently two hours in length , should be arranged for the meetings of the group . It is also desirable to give the supervisors an idea of approximately how many meetings the training program will comprise . The meeting should start promptly ; in the event of tardiness , the discussion should begin at least as soon as half of the group members are present . The session should be closed promptly at the specified time . If evening meetings are held and the group is in the midst of a live discussion evidencing little desire to break up , the leader may announce that the closing time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engagements are free to leave but that he will be glad to stay on for a short time in order to finish up the point under discussion . Since the meeting hours are definitely restricted and the group is expected to cover the substance of a single discussion outline within that time the problem of timing each discussion is all-important . The leader is constantly forced to make a decision or compromise between his desire on the one hand to have the group gain as comprehensive a  | picture of the entire problem as possible and on the other to ensure that the discussion is thorough-going and specific enough to be worthwhile . Time scheduling therefore needs to be done before any new topic is taken up . The leader 's function in this connection is like that of a train dispatcher whose job it is to see that successive trains pull out on scheduled time . Devices for Saving Time A number of points may be considered in connection with this problem of maintaining a discussion schedule . The leader should make up a time table showing the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be spent on each chart and other parts of the discussion , and how much time he proposes to use in summarizing . In order to conform fairly closely to this schedule his watch should be on the table before him . In the development of a chart having two or three columns which are horizontally related to each other , if ' a leader finds that time is getting short , he may use the following device . He will get the group quickly to suggest the items on the left side of the chart ( possibly a column headed " Cause " ) without asking for any case material . Turning then to the right side of the chart ( where methods of correction are to be considered ) he can , in order to save time , ask the group to discuss in detail and with illustrations only the more important points shown on the left . Even though each point is thus not discussed in minute detail the group has the benefit of receiving an overall picture of the problem involved . This vertical rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determinate discussion . It is not used in more loosely conducted conference work in which an incompleted topic may be taken up at the following meeting . Another method of shortening the discussion as applied to a given chart is for the leader to center upon and list the more important items rather than take time for those of less importance . Too much time is lost by some discussion leaders in closing the discussion in relation to a certain point . They feel it necessary to ask the group whether every member agrees with the general conclusions expressed . They may go from one group member to another to get his formal approval . Complete individual agreement on the part of every member of the group is not to be expected . The leader 's problem is one of sensing the attitude of the group members as expressed by their words and by their appearance . As soon as he feels that there is substantial agreement and that no one takes strenuous exception to a point under discussion he should push along to a new idea . A majority opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; taking a vote tends to fix men more strongly in their convictions than  | before . If this is done those who objected in the first place may still tend to revert to the point later on . If discussion of an important chart can not possibly be completed within the allotted time the leader may suggest to the group that a number of points have not been taken up and give them a synopsis of some of the questions they might have considered had they had time . A variation of this technique is for the leader to pass out the summary charts of the discussion shortly before closing the meeting and lead the group in discussing briefly the points that were not reached . Such devices are usually not desirable . The comments made here with reference to the need for scheduling the distribution of time among the more important aspects of any topic should not be interpreted as a suggestion that the working up of allinclusive charts is the primary objective . Even though a number of useful points may not be listed or discussed such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and replete with illustrations . The important aim of discussion is the absorption of useful ideas by members of the group , not a word-guessing game . There are a few situations when it may be necessary for a leader to permit a sidetrack which will retard the group 's progress on its topic . At times a member of the group may wish to revert to a previous topic in order to clear up a questionable point or to obtain further advice from the group . Such an interruption is of course proper . Whenever a supervisor has tried out or proposes to try out an idea he obtained from the discussions the leader should make a point of calling attention to this fact and ask the man to report on his experience . This tends to make the group feel that its members are profiting as a result of their meetings . There are also times when a supervisor is faced with a particular problem which is so important to him that he can think of nothing else . He wants to talk about it and get some advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the discussion and get the group to help the man in question work out his particular problem . The Leader 's Physical Activity in the Meeting The physical activity and mannerisms of the leader play an important part in influencing and controlling the discussion . Since attention is centered upon him the nature of his movements in the course ' of the discussion have a definite bearing upon the attention , attitude , and thinking of the conferees . As a simple illustration , his action in sitting down or standing up will influence the flow of discussion . He can sometimes rise to command attention or to regain control of a discussion which needs more precise direction . He may sit down in order to center the group 's attention upon a man who is citing an interesting case . Gestures are frequently required to emphasize more important aspects of the discussion and in summarizing its high points at the  | close of the meeting . A leader may use too many gestures or may pace back and forth too much , as a result of which the men 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirable for a leader to change his position from time to time as may be required to control the discussion ; he may walk to one side or another of the horseshoe discussion group in order to break up side discussions . Many leaders have found that smoking a pipe with its operations of filling , lighting , and emptying , gives them time to collect their thoughts , to frame questions or to recall illustrations which are needed to meet unexpected angles in the course of the discussion . The important thing is for the leader to be natural but still to be active and forceful enough to keep the discussion moving along at a lively pace . The leader needs to watch his actions closely and to be deliberate . Some leaders unconsciously overdo the habits of jumping up and sitting down , of pacing back and forth like animals in a zoo , of standing in front of the chart so that the group members can not see it clearly , of twiddling their fingers , or playing with a marking crayon or penknife . Such mannerisms result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the topic . Another common and unconscious fault of leaders is to use the same phrase repeatedly until it becomes extremely annoying . The repetition of " so to speak , " " in other words , " " right , " " what does the group think ? " or similar phrases becomes extremely boring . They are as objectionable as is the action of a speaker who invariably finishes a word with " al " or " er " whenever he pauses to think or goes from one sentence to another . Some leaders who expect to engage in discussion leadership over a period of time may do well to take instruction in public speaking . In leading a discussion the tone of voice and the tempo of speech are important . The leader may speak too loud or too fast ; he may speak too slow or in a tone that is inaudible to distant members of the group . lle needs to modulate his voice and avoid speaking in a monotone in order to provide the necessary emphasis for those points which require it . In order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he appears before the group the leader can appropriately obtain the frank criticism of group members or visitors whom he knows well and who will not hesitate to express their opinion regarding his manner of presentation . A leader rarely appreciates his own shortcomings in this , connection .  | WALL CHARTS AND OTHER VISUAL AIDS Advantages of Recording the Discussion A running chronicle of the significant points developed in a conference , compiled as the discussion proceeds , has numerous benefits . Not all of these advantages may occur to those who have had little or no experience in discussion leadership . It may therefore first be of value briefly to review the reasons why the leader should provide a summary record on a " wall chart . " The term " chart " as used throughout this handbook refers to a record lettered on a large sheet of paper and mounted in plain sight of the group . r . Charting the discussion provides a visual aid of substantial value in the learning process . Since most persons are eye-minded rather than ear-minded , they tend more readily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The visual record thus fortifies and implements the auditory impressions received . 2 . The attention of the group is centered on the specific aspect of the topic under discussion . A chart enables the members to keep track of the points suggested and directs their thinking to the matter under discussion as nothing else can . As a result , it tends to promote the offering of responses in a logical and systematic fashion . It is also useful in assisting those group members who arrive late to enter more quickly into the discussion . 3 . A clear wall chart definitely prevents the repetition of points offered in the course of the discussion . It therefore expedites the progress of the conference . When a pertinent idea is graphically shown , members of the group are less likely to generate concepts which involve a duplication of the point already discussed . 4 . Summary charts assist greatly in avoiding sidetracks or excursions into other unrelated topics to which a conference frequently finds its way . With their attention centered on the point under discussion , members of the group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also helpful to the leader in keeping his attention concentrated on the particular point at issue . 5 . The visual aid provided by a chart tends to stimulate interest in 58  | the discussion and to promote the flow of ideas . An entry of a group member 's contribution on the chart means its adoption by the group , and therefore encourages other members to compete for similar recognition . 6 . As the group becomes familiar with the charting procedure , its members tend to become more precise in their use of words in order that the point in question may be appropriately expressed . Such wholesome interest on the part of the conferees in proving their ability to express themselves naturally develops habits of more accurate thinking . 7 . A self-evident advantage of a wall chart is that it provides a permanent summary record of the discussion which has taken place . If the group has gone into subject matter relative to which different points of view have been expressed , the record thus shows all those present just what has been agreed on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the leader in drawing conclusions and in making his summary at the close of the meeting . 9 . A chart record may provide considerable satisfaction to the group and to its individual members . It shows them that they have accomplished something of value in the course of the meeting ; they leave the room recognizing that worthwhile results have been achieved . io . If the wall charts are retained they can be referred to at subsequent meetings in order to review topics discussed or to clear up debatable points . They can also be shown for critical comment to the official to whom the leader reports or to other executives who may be interested in knowing something of the progress of the training program . i 1 . Finally , a permanent record of this kind provides a means by which the leader may evaluate his achievement . Following a conference , he may go back and study the points listed , compare them with what he was trying to have the group develop , and study the difficulties encountered at certain points in the discussion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Legible Charts Essential If the benefits suggested above are to be realized to any appreciable extent , the summaries of a discussion shown on a wall chart must be ( I ) legible , ( 2 ) intelligible , and ( 3 ) cogently pertinent . Entries must be easily read by every member of the group . Attention must therefore be given to the size of the letters used and the spacing between lines and parallel columns . The proper illumination of the charts and their place in the room are important . Chart entries may be legible but they need also to be easily understood . They need to make sense to even the dullest member of the group . They should be as understandable and carry as much meaning weeks after the discussion has been held as at the time of their listing . Not only must words and clauses be neatly phrased and to the point , but a series of entries should be rela-  | tively consistent . For example , a list of points should not scramble nouns , verbs , and adjectives in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entries within the list being either nouns or verb phrases , for example . Finally , it is obvious that each entry must be deftly selected as to have a direct and significant bearing on the point under discussion . The final record should be clear-cut and definitely pertinent . The need for precision in charting can , of course , be overemphasized , and it is possible for a leader to be too meticulous and lose too much time in maintaining his record . On the other hand , there is a common disposition to underestimate the significance of concise yet comprehensive charts . As an illustration , a leader may feel that he can write neatly enough and need not train himself to letter his entries . Lettering has been found to take but little more time than writing . Practice in it is naturally required , but the knack of fast lettering once acquired is immensely helpful to the leader during the discussion . When a long list of carelessly written words appear on a chart , each member of the group must accustom himself to decipher the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time is lost as each painstakingly reads through the illegible list in order to see whether an idea which he proposes to offer has already been recorded . The Knack of Condensing Chart Entries A good wall chart may be compared to the headlines on the front page of a newspaper . Newspaper headlines stand out bold and clear . They force themselves on one 's attention . They are short and concise . Within a few words , they summarize the content of perhaps several ' olumns of text . A newspaper headline writer has to develop the knack of condensing and telescoping more or less involved ideas . A discussion leader needs to develop the same talent . Since members of his group can rarely express themselves very well , whenever an idea is brought out in too many words or in awkward terms , it is the leader 's function to boil it down or render it more precisely . He may ask the group 's approval to enter an improved or revised version of the original suggestion . He thus saves time and clarifies and interprets the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pathway . The leader should endeavor to grasp the essence of the subject matter and enter it on the chart in concise form . He needs to peel off the successive layers of the artichoke and get at the heart as quickly as possible . When the standard outlines in Part II of this book are being used by him as a pattern , he should make a consistent effort to develop points along the lines of those suggested in the typical charts . By studying them in advance he will be able to recall certain phrases which can be appropriately used to summarize an experience reported by a member of the group . He may frequently select a popular or slang phrase which naturally . expresses the idea . Terms like " clock-  | watcher , " " beefer , " and " passing the buck , " by way of illustration , are often helpful . The comment of Guy de Maupassant relative to the choice of words to be used by a short story writer may be quoted to advantage , for it applies with equal force to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of words for chart entry : " Whatever the thing we wish to say , there is but one word to express it , but one verb to give it movement , but one adjective to qualify it . We must seek till we find this noun , this verb , and this adjective , and never be content with getting very near it , never allow ourselves to play tricks , even happy ones , or have recourse to sleights of language to avoid a difficulty . . . . There is no need for an eccentric vocabulary to formulate every shade of thought .... " The leader should avoid writing long and involved sentences which make a chart tedious to read . The entries selected should give a simple and clear-cut indication of the thought of the group . He should not quibble over the precise meaning of words or allow members of the group to do so . In selecting terms for entry the leader should not force his own opinion too strongly , but should be sufficiently conversant with the meaning of words to be able tactfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his function to know the " one best word . " Too much time may otherwise be lost by the group in haggling over the wording of entries . If , for example , a case is cited of a man who deliberately evades his task , the leader should not permit an argument as to whether the proper term is " loafing , " " laziness , " " killing time , " or " indolence , " but may suggest that " shirking " is possibly the best description of the point in question . Unnecessary words , articles , and conjunctions can frequently be omitted . Abstract terms and those which have several meanings should be shunned . In general , the leader should avoid terms like " poor supervision , " " efficiency , " " personality , " and " proper . " If " poor supervision " is offered by a group member , the leader should come back at him with questions designed to bring out a more specific entry . He may say : " Just what does poor supervision mean ? In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the supervisor in question falling down ? " In order to develop skill in suggesting and condensing chart entries , a discussion leader naturally needs to become thoroughly familiar with the standard charts set forth herein and to become a student of words . His study of a dictionary and a Thesaurus has already been suggested elsewhere . Keeping Up with the Discussion Some conference leaders are apt to be too slow in writing or lettering on a chart . In consequence , valuable discussion time is lost and  | the attention of the group lags . The leader should therefore develop the knack of lettering fast and legibly . Difficulty is nevertheless sometimes experienced in keeping the discussion moving while the leader is charting . If too much time is spent in entering a lengthy point on the wall chart , the group will sit back and watch in silence . This may result in a break in its thought and attention . If the leader is able to do so , he should go ahead and talk while lettering . He may , for example , elaborate on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a specific case to illustrate it . If the item to he entered is a very long one , he may suggest to the group members that they continue their discussion while he enters the point in question , or he may suggest that they be thinking of other items next to be listed on the chart . Keeping up with the rapid flow of points suggested in a lively discussion presents another problem . It may be possible to urge members of the group to take their turn and then to take up the more important points suggested one at a time . This requires the leader to remember which men in the group offered suggestions . It may be possible for him to jot down a man 's name or a brief word suggestive of the idea offered at one side of the chart ; this will serve as a reminder . A useful device is to accept and chart a good point to which no exception can be taken , at the same time asking for an illustration to back it up . This has the advantage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another method of keeping up with main points of a pertinent nature is to enter a few letters of a word on a chart and complete it later when the group stops to consider the suggestion in detail . If the group later disagrees with an entry it can always be eliminated by drawing a line through it . When a suggestion is made which is definitely beside the point under discussion , the leader may tactfully question whether it is germane and have it withdrawn or he may say : " That 's a good point , but does it fit in with what we are discussing right now ? We expect to get to that later . Let 's make a note of it for future reference . " He may then make a notation at the bottom or side of the chart , rather than running the item into the chart which is being developed . As the various suggestions are listed on the wall chart , the leader may properly throw in an occasional word of acknowledgment , such as " good , that 's certainly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " His language should be varied and he should avoid the monotonous effect of constantly saying , for example , " All right , what next ? " Physical Equipment for Charts A record of the discussion is best maintained on large sheets of paper on which entries are made with black crayon . Paper charts are to be preferred to blackboards . The latter are objectionable for a ncnnber of reasons . Blackboards are connnonly not large enough and result in cramping or shortening the discussion record or in necessitating the  | erasure of a part of it in order to make room for the remainder . All too frequently a blackboard is not washed often enough and becomes so gray that chalk entries are almost illegible . Because of the ease with which it is done , blackboard writing tends to become progressively careless . The most serious objection to the use of a blackboard for purposes of determinate discussion , however , is that no permanent record of the discussion is preserved for reference purposes by the leader , by other interested persons , or by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , large sheets of paper stock can be used in any quantity desired in the course of a given discussion . Sheets of paper can be attached to a smoothly finished wooden or painted wall in any room by means of short strips of transparent Scotch tape without doing any damage whatever to the surface of the wall . This obviates the use of elaborate easels or blackboard devices , although in some situations special equipment of that kind has to be provided because of the design of the conference room . White-colored signwriters ' paper , thirty-six inches in width and sold by the roll , is a popular type of paper for charting purposes . Still better is an extra-heavy grade of newsprint which is wider , less expensive , but sometimes difficult to obtain locally . Ordinary newsprint tears too easily . Light-colored buff wrapping paper is not objectionable and can be obtained in widths up to forty-eight inches . As suggested , the easiest method for hanging the charts is for the leader to affix them directly to a smooth wall surface , placing some plain sheets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may stand out more clearly . As each chart is completed in turn , it is lifted off and hung in plain view to one side so that the group may observe it for reference purposes . It is naturally important to select the best place in the room to hang the wall charts and to provide proper illumination so that the glare from the lights will not prevent certain members of the group from reading the entries on them . Lettering on the charts can best be done with black marking crayon . The three-eighths inch size sold at the five-and-ten-cent stores is entirely suitable . Lumber marking crayon is usually too hard . Compressed charcoal is preferred by some leaders and is easy to use when the knack has been acquired ; it shows up very well , but smudges easily . A helpful device is for the leader to make use of colored crayon , notably red , in underlining and checking high points of the discussion on the charts , thus reinforcing and driving home conclusions , particularly in his summary . The Leader Should Do His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clerk or secretary to record the high points of the discussion on charts would enable the leader to concentrate more easily on his task of conducting the discussion . Actual  | experience with this device , however , has not proven successful . The mental processes of the leader in guiding the discussion , in interpreting its conclusions , and summarizing them on the chart are so intimately interwoven with those of a secretary that they can not be segregated without a loss of momentum to the discussion . When two men stand before a discussion group , the attention of its members is drawn to the mechanics of the chart work more than when the leader himself does it more or less as a matter of course . If the leader employs a secretary , it is necessary for the latter to know almost as much about the topic and the entries which should be put down as the leader himself . The two need to be almost telepathic , or they will be taking the time of the conference in arriving at an understanding of just what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fully informed , many errors-in the chart work will of course occur . In general , it is far more satisfactory for a leader to become an expert at charting and to appreciate that it is a highly important part of his work rather than a menial job . Chart Headings Prepared in Advance It is desirable for the leader to do certain preliminary chart work in advance of the discussion in order that his charts may be well planned and neat in appearance . In order that the group may be informed of the day 's topic and encouraged to think about it as they gather for the meeting , it is well to have the general title of the topic neatly lettered in large-sized letters at the cop of the first chart sheet . If desired , this may be entered on a covering sheet which can be lifted up after the nature of the first chart to be discussed has been introduced . It is well to letter the main heading of each chart in advance in order that it may be neatly done and properly spaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ columns to be developed , may be entered as the leader proceeds , if desired . Main chart headings , and elaborate subheadings prepared in advance of the discussion , should be concealed until the leader has paved the way for their introduction and suggested the logic of considering them . This can be done by folding up the bottom part of the chart , doubling it over the headings in question and fastening it with a bit of Scotch tape until it is ready for use . Proponents of the unballasted conference of twenty years ago will feel that chart headings should not be prepared in advance and may contend that the group should develop its own headings . An exceptional group of intelligent supervisors can undoubtedly assist in directing its own discussion . The average group needs guidance . Discussion time is valuable and is much better spent in intelligent determinate discussion than in debating the technique for that discussion . It may be added that prepared headings do not qualify the spontaneity of the  | discussion in the experience of competent leaders who have used both methods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right size which will permit plenty of room for all columns and entries which may possibly be needed , and to have extra sheets ready if necessary . In order that the lettering of the inexperienced leader may tend to be neat and legible and may run neither uphill nor downhill , it will be helpful for him , in advance of the meeting , to draw light guide lines across the chart sheets with an ordinary pencil . Care should be taken as he proceeds with the discussion that he does not unduly increase or decrease the size of his lettering . When once the chart headings have been disclosed and properly introduced for discussion , the leader should proceed promptly to list the pertinent points suggested by members of the group . Too much time is frequently spent in aimless discussion which should be directed to getting down to business . Headings for Special Topics Every successful discussion involves the use of chart headings . These are obviously needed to organize and direct discussion into profitable channels and to center attention on the topic under discussion . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a specialized nature not dealt with herein ( particularly those concerned with troublesome operating problems arising in the plant or office on which advice is sought by the management ) other headings than those found in the charts contained in Part II may be useful to him . In such a case headings may be adapted from the chart on the following page . Other Graphic Aids The conference leader should be familar with the ordinary methods of graphic presentation . Reference handbooks dealing with graphs are usually available in local libraries and should be consulted by him in this connection . In addition to the lettered charts discussed above , the discussion leader will find other visual aids of value to him in his work . Graphs and statistical charts can be obtained or prepared in advance and presented to the group for its information . Diagrams or sketches are most helpful in promoting understanding of mechanical or construction points . Timely cartoons related to the topic under discussion can be hung up in the conference room . If the topic is accident prevention , safety posters should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate forms or handbooks in use in the organization should be passed around for reference use . The use of visual aids in training soldiers , sailors , and war workers expanded greatly ( luring World War II . Draftsmen and artists were used to produce posters , cartoons , charts , photographs , and cutouts.  | figure One large organization , for example , livened its supervisory program by providing specially drawn color posters for each discussion topic . These contained cartoons and slogans such as : " A Keyman Never Stops Learning , " " Information Please , " " Do n't be a Bottle-Neck , " " What Is Your Goal for 1943 ? " Large copies were displayed at the supervisors ' meetings and smaller copies were handed each trainee for his file . Another firm prepared a four-page leaflet for each topic summarizing and illustrating the topic . Material of this kind has its place but can be overdone . Large sums may be spent on inferior art work or shoddy text material which distract attention from a genuine learning process and are not referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is primarily a teacher and not a showman .  | Great improvement was made during the war in models and " mockups , " largely of machine parts , and used primarily in providing job instruction for women and other beginners in the manufacturing field . An outstanding example is the use of hinged cellophane cutout sheets by the Army Air Service Command to illustrate the construction and assembly of various types of airplane motors . Models were used most effectively by the Quartermaster Corps in teaching logistics and by the Air Corps in explaining the identification of foreign planes . In conjunction with supervisory training the use of such material is naturally restricted to discussions of technical subject matter as mentioned on page 25 . Slide Films and Motion Pictures Four special types of visual aids are available to the trainer of supervisors . The silent slide film is the modern version of the old-time magic lantern ; it permits photographs , diagrams , charts , or text to be flashed on a screen in the course of a lecture presentation . The sound slide film combines a phonographic record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashed by the operator as the subject matter develops . The silent motion picture using either small or regular . sized film may be considered for occasional use . Finally , there is the standard sound motion picture . While it is true that we are just beginning to speak the language of pictures , the " Esperanto " of education , picture and sound projection appear to have definite limitations as applied to training in supervision . These handicaps make it impossible to justify a claim that foremen can be trained by visual aids alone . Such apparatus is frequently indispensable in providing job instruction in machine assembly or army gunnery but even there the learning process needs to be reinforced by actual work application . Training in supervision deals largely with variations in human relationships and no actual " practice " can be provided in a classroom . The ability to solve a wide range of problems in industrial relations depends on the acquisition of experience or on the development of logical habits of analysis and reasoning . The process may be accelerated but not achieved by technicolor or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is needed to develop reasoning capacity . Some of the larger distributors of sound slide films recognize this principle in supplying detailed discussion outlines with each supervisory training film . The ordinary substitute for actual practice in supervisory training is for the discussion leader and members of his group to portray in their own words " cases " or situations which they have experienced . When this pool of experience is meager or the learners are amateurs in the art of handling men , it may be desirable to implement the discussion method with films . In such a situation the instructor must find answers  | to questions such as these : Can the topic be satisfactorily illustrated ? What type of film would be best ? Should a film be made to order , bought , or rented ? What about projectors ? How large should the group be ? How often should films be used ? Should they be re-run and when ? How can the results be checked ? After these points are disposed of , the instructor must decide whether more can be accomplished with the assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruction in the same amount of time and with the same expenditure of funds . Careful advance planning is needed to ensure the right film strips at the right time . As to the type of film equipment to be considered , little use has been made in human relations training of the silent slide film because of its inability to portray feeling and action . The sound slide film is far more satisfactory ; good films can be bought or rented from several commercial film companies . The application and value of these " canned " films is unfortunately restricted to some extent since their locale is usually a single line of industry , such as a machine shop or an oil refinery , for example . It may therefore be difficult to sublimate the instructional content of the film to supervisors in a department store or a power plant . Furthermore , the story narrated by the film may not strike specifically at the training needs of the groups involved or may have to be reinterpreted in the light of local rules or customs . Large enterprises with many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene and content deal directly with the employer 's own business . In some cases the company has its own producing facilities ; more commonly the task has been undertaken in collaboration with a commercial film company specializing in this field . Large steel , rubber , and automotive companies have developed their own sound slide films . In using a sound film in conjunction with discussion , no general rule can be laid down as to their sequence . This will depend on the nature of the group , on the scenario of the film , the points requiring most emphasis , and the capacity of the discussion leader . An experienced leader often prefers to conduct a discussion along the lines of the outlines in Part II of this volume and then show the picture as a means of illustrating and clinching the subject in the minds of the trainees . Groups with lesser experience may be shown the film and then led into a charted discussion . Some films may be quickly shown and then rewound , the pictures being thrown back upon the screen individually and discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any summary discussion and charting of points must be reserved until after the pictures have been reviewed . A few of the commercial films , one for example dealing with the introduction of new employees , are divided into two parts , a problem and a solution . The first half of the film is shown and followed by a challenging discussion as to the remedies to  | be pursued . The film solution is then given as a check upon the conclusions reached by the group . Any film can be stopped at any point for discussion ; this procedure is likely to encourage digressions which may interfere with logical group thinking . Some of the supervisory films available portray foremanship groups in the act of developing wall charts . These are interesting and informative but may tend to hinder the immediate group from developing its own distinctive material . In evaluating the merits of a training film , the Michigan State Board for Vocational Education suggests the following questions : ( 1 ) Is the . material in the film organized for instructional purposes ? ( 2 ) Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the technical quality of the film satisfactory ? ( 4 ) Is the presentation paced for instruction ? ( 5 ) Is the film of suitable length or can it be broken into sequences for instructional purposes ? ( 6 ) Is the material on a suitable instructional level for the group in which it is to be used ? Silent motion pictures find little application in supervisory training . Sound motion pictures , though admirable in many ways , are , generally much too expensive for training in human relations . They have found their place as tools in the orientation of new employees and in building morale . As such , they are frequently used as supplements in a training program for supervisors .

This is the concept of playacting a given situation adapted from the research in psycho-dynamics of J. L. Moreno , a psychiatrist . It is receiving a great deal of study front educators and is widely used at the summer sessions of the National " Training Laboratory in Group Development at Bethel , Maine .  | Despite the enthusiasm with which it is meeting , it is conceded to have its limitations since it is useful only under specific conditions . Any good illustrative incident which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be restaged with the assistance of one or two other members assigned to supporting roles . For the most part , however , role-playing in the broader field of education is used to dramatize an assumed situation which has not been experienced , but which , if it is , will be better met or understood . It stimulates the imagination and emotions of both the amateur actors and the audience and greatly assists in understanding the viewpoint and attitude of others . An important point is that all role-playing must be unrehearsed and spontaneous ; there is no preparation other than a clear statement of necessary facts regarding the players and the particular situation which they face in their personal relationship . The scene is usually cut off by the leader for critical discussion and conclusions after not more than ten minutes . Role-playing may be used in supervisory training , for example , to illustrate the method of making a particularly difficult " exit interview , " of selling the need for using safety equipment to a hardheaded worker , of negotiating a labor contract , of convincing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vizualizing just what happens if a sudden strike is called or if some catastrophe looms .  | PREPARING TO PRESENT A TOPIC Need for Preliminary Study The reader who is preparing for discussion leadership may feel that such a task is not difficult as long as the general principles here set forth are observed . It is true that conducting a good discussion appears superficially to be rather an easy task . The very fact that a determinate discussion appears to a casual observer to be a simple affair should not disguise the fact ghat considerable effort and ingenuity are involved in conducting it successfully . For it requires the application of intelligence ; it requires practice and experience . Although controlled discussion gives its members an impression that they are adducing nearly all of the ideas developed , as a matter of fact it is the leader 's preparedness which is responsible for intelligent results . The successful leader learns and profits by experience . No two conference situations are ever identical ; constant alertness is needed to meet these varied situations as they arise . The art and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion leader through constant efforts to improve himself . Of first importance is the need for preliminary study of subject matter . No discussion leader can rush into a meeting at the last moment , know little of the topic , and expect to achieve worthwhile results . It will be found that nearly every obstacle or embarrassment encountered by the leader as the discussion proceeds is attributable to his lack of understanding of the subject and to inadequate preparation . In the case of a leader to whom the guidance of discussions has been entrusted as an added task , the pressure of other duties is likely to interfere with his study of what is to be discussed . Group leadership should not be entrusted to executives who can not be definitely freed of other work so as to provide time for adequate preparation . A definite period each week needs to be set aside for advance study . Before meeting with a group of supervisors on a new topic , it is needful for the leader to become thoroughly conversant with ( u ) its objectives , ( 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 3 ) the sequence of thought flowing through and connecting these phases , and ( q ) the significant 71  | points to be adduced in each phase . Unless a leader has had earlier training or experience of a nature which enables him quickly to systematize and correlate the many details of a given subject , he will find it necessary to spend from seven to ten hours in advance preparation and rehearsal . Supplemental reading is helpful and may be essential in dealing with certain topics . Steps in Preparation In studying a new topic , it is best to read through the entire outline and supporting charts quickly in order to gain an over-all picture of what is involved . At this time , it will be useful to make sure that the meanings of words which will be frequently used are thoroughly understood . Useful synonyms can be written out to advantage in this connection . Next , it is helpful to consider the stated purposes of the discussion one by one and determine which of the standard charts serves to accomplish each purpose . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure or framework of the discussion out:ine and the relationship of its parts . An understanding of the sequence of the various aspects of the topic to be discussed provides the leader with a better appreciation of the relative importance of each aspect ; it paves the way for him to determine a time schedule by which an approximate specified time will be devoted to each discussion phase . The leader may then take up each section of the discussion outline in detail . In relation to the supporting chart to be developed , he should ask himself : " Just how can these ideas be brought out in order to drive home this concept ? " At this point , he needs to shift his thinking from the abstract to the concrete and interpret basic concepts and principles in terms of the work experience of the particular group with which he is to deal . He needs also to distinguish between the more important and less important chart items to be developed and to consider the problem of coordinating the immediate aspect of the topic with what has preceded and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and charts in considerable detail , the leader needs to prepare a written work sheet which provides him with a specific and detailed map of his proposed course . The preparation of work sheets is further discussed below . Finally , it is ordinarily imperative to rehearse the presentation of a new topic before presenting it . There is a vast difference between having ideas in one 's mind and being able to express them orally . Ideas can not be intelligibly expressed nor do words which one is unaccustomed to speaking flow freely unless they are spoken out loud . The leader therefore needs to recite his introduction and the questions he proposes to ask , either to himself or in the presence of a few associates , if his subsequent presentation irr conference is to be a smooth one . When two or more leaders are able to work together in preparing themselves for a topic , such an tinder-  | taking is much simpler . A leader 's rehearsal is in part abbreviated or telescoped since it is unnecessary for him to develop the more obvious chart entries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work sheet consists of a fairly detailed synopsis of the prospective discussion as the leader visualizes it in advance . It might be termed the minutes of a one-man conference . A record of this kind should be painstakingly written out or typed by the leader even if it is subsequently thrown in the wastebasket . The writing serves to stimulate his thinking and organize his ideas . The work sheet contains finished statements and/or questions used in introducing the topic , the words of explanation needed to introduce each successive chart and to effect a transition from one chart to another , and a concluding summary for use at the close of the meeting . It also lists general and leading questions needed to draw out the more important points in each standard chart . It thus goes beyond merely copying extracts from the discussion outline or from the standard charts . The . purpose of the work sheet is to train the leader concisely to express the basic ideas and concepts of the topic in his own words and to adapt the discussion outline to the specific needs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the leader need not memorize phrases or sentences from the " preface " or the " discussion outline , " but should endeavor to be original and interpret such ideas in his own way . A work sheet should also provide definite suggestions for effecting a graceful transition from one part of the discussion to the next and a clear-cut closing summary which will reinforce the conclusions arrived at by the group . For each chart point with which any difficulty is anticipated , a clear-cut suggestive question should be drafted and written down . If the topic is taken up with more than one group of supervisors , the leader may revamp his work sheet , improving it upon the basis of his experience with the first group . After the work sheet has been prepared and used as a basis for rehearsing the topic , the leader may then draw off a skeleton outline of such important highlights as he needs to record for reference purposes . This summary can , if desired , be entered on cards . The following will serve to provide a suggestion as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one leader 's idea of the practical application of Outline #5 of Part II to the discussion of a group of municipal foremen engaged on construction work . It should he compared in minute detail with the discussion outline itself by the leader so that he may fully understand the construction of work sheets for e'aclu topic he presents .  | SAMPLE OF LEADER 'S WORK SHEET ? THE WASTE OF TIME Introduction : Our city administration and employees have been subject to criticism . The most common may be that of " boon-doggling " or its equivalent . ( Elaborate with the telling of a " shovel leaner " story . The following is an example from a newspaper column in the city in question : ) Street scene : In 17th Avenue Northwest ( or maybe 18th ) : Four city employees , heads together , leaning on shovels , conversing earnestly while a fellow worker works . Half a block away , an overseer , overseeing . Question : How do you as foreman feel when you hear such criticism ? Possible answers : Angry . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not justified . Statement : In any case it does not help the city 's standing with the taxpayers and you will agree we should all do all we can to forestall it . But there is more to this idle time than just public criticism . Q : What happens to a man who goes on for some time loafing and getting away with it ? P.A. ? Gets lazy ? Forms bad working habits . St : Such a man will have trouble getting and holding employment . There is , of course , some idle time over which we have no control , so we will only consider that which we can do something about . Q : Let 's go at this systematically . First , what are some of the effects or results of " loafing on the job " ? 1 . On the project as a whole ? P.A. ? Costs 2 . On the gang ? P.A. ? Loss of morale ? Horseplay 3 . On the foreman ? P.A. ? Trouble 4 . On other workers or gangs ? P.A. ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other suggestions which are pertinent are charted promptly on Chart I which has been headed in advance . When ' leader is satisfied that he has a representative list he is ready to proceed with the next chart . ) St : We have listed some of the effects or results of idle time . Now let 's see if we can discover some of the ways of preventing it . ( Uncover chart for WAYS TO PREVENT WASTED TIME headed up in advance of meeting : ) St : But before we do that maybe it would be wise to list some of the causes . ( Points to sub-head CAUSES . ) St : In order to keep from wandering all over the lot , let 's first consider the causes in the worker . ( Put up heading IN THE MAN . ) Q : In every foreman 's mind there is usually a pretty definite opinion of each of his men . What are some of the more common ? P.A. ? Good worker ? Lazy ? Dumb ? Slow . ( NOTE : List those that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreman leaves the job ? P.A. ? Loafinghorseplay . Q : What might happen if you kept a skilled carpenter on a job of building rough mixing boxes for a long period ? P.A. ? Lose interest and kill time . Q : What might be the effect on a man if he had a sick child at home ? P.A. Worry ? Distracted mind . ( NOTE : These and other needed questions are designed for use only when the response is slow or to bring out an important point . It is possible that  | while considering causes under the heading IN THE MAN , some may come out that should go under the heading IN THE JOB . He would then out in the additional heading and list the point . If not he will go on with : ) St : We have a fine list of causes in the worker but what about the job itself ? ( Put in heading IN THE JOB . ) Q : Give an example from your own experience where the conditions of the job itself have caused idleness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not coming regularly . Q : How would you state that briefly ? P.A. ? Poor planning ? uneven flow ? not enough work ? men bunched and getting in one another 's way ? men strung out so far that some are out of sight of the foreman . Q : What would you call that ? P.A. ? Loose supervision . EXAMPLE BY LEADER : I saw a case last summer where most of the shovels in the gang were either worn down or broken and the men were grumbling and taking every excuse possible to stall . What would you call that ? P.A. ? Improper tools or equipment . ( NOTE : When a leader is satisfied that he has the wore important points and the subject seems to be exhausted , he leaves it and proceeds . ) St : Now we have most of the causes and it is time to see what we can do about it . Put in heading WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT . ( NOTE : In this part of the conference , the leader is limited to those items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chart . For each item listed there , the leader asks for a concrete EXAMPLE or CASE and has the foreman tell WHAT WAS DONE in the particular situation . This supplies a suggestion for entry in the right hand column . ) Ex. ? A workman who had previously been a good worker suddenly starts loafing or day dreaming . Q : What was done about it ? P.A. ? I investigated the cause and found .. . etc. , etc . CONCLUSION : You have suggested that a lot of serious things may happen if our workers , especially those in the public eye , are not kept on the job at all times . We next went on to consider the reasons why we may have idle time ? both on the part of a worker himself and in the way the job is supervised . You emphasized that " lack of interest " and an imaginary " pull " were particularly important things to watch out for . Finally , we considered some definite ways and means of meeting and overcoming the causes for wasted time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us as foremen can eliminate most of the idleness from our jobs if we use our heads to find out the reasons and then apply the proper remedy on the job just as we have here in our discussion . T. W. I. Work Sheets Precise outlines for the leader 's guidance were also an important Characteristic of the Training-Within-Industry program . Standardization of presentation was believed to be imperative : The assumption proved itself . The following , for example , is an excerpt from a JIT manual in which the trainer makes the point that a job can not be taught by merely showing how it is done . Ten minutes are allowed for this presentation .  | 4 . SHOWING is another common means of instruction in the shop . ? It also is an excellent method when used properly . But it also has limitations ? and serious ones . ? Explain again that you are " taking apart the process of instruction and examining each part separately . " ? Turn to another member near you . Do not ask him to stand . Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you know how to tie the knot ? " ( If he knows , turn to another ) ? " Again this sample job is only an example . Think of it in terms of YOUR OWN JOB in YOUR OWN DEPARTMENT . " 5 . SHOW member how to tie the knot , by doing it once in front of him . NOTE ? BE SURE he sees it BACKWARDS . DO N'T EXPLAIN ? REMAIN ABSOLUTELY SILENT . ? Then hand the cord to the member and ask him to tie it . NOTE ? If he ties it , but backwards , this is just as useful as though he failed to tie it . If by any chance he ties it correctly , compliment him , and turn to another member . After member completes trial , untie knot , twist loose ends back together and put it in your pocket . Do n't hold it or fuss with it . 6 . DISCUSS : ? Failure was not the member 's fault . ? SHOWING , alone , is NOT GOOD INSTRUCTION . ? He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job from the proper angle , most people do n't " get it . " ? Most of us just " copy motions " ; this does n't mean we understand . ? Many motions are hard to copy . ? " Tricky points " are missed . ? We do n't know what to look for . ? We ca n't translate what we see into what we should do . ? And yet thousands of employees are being SHOWN how to do their jobs at this very moment . How many of them understand ? ? Emphasize that IF THE WORKER HAS N'T LEARNED , THE INSTRUCTOR HAS N'T TAUGHT . At the bottom of each page of the manual is the warning : " WORK FROM THIS OUTLINE ? DO N'T TRUST TO MEMORY . " Time limits of from five to twenty minutes are specified for each part of a two-hour presentation . The Use of Notes in a Meeting After the meeting is under way , the leader may find it necessary to take occasional glances at the standard charts , copies of which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important items have not been overlooked by the group . He may also find it necessary to refer to his notes or abstracts of the work sheet . He should not hold his notes in his hand nor should he at any time in the meeting refer to the text of this volume . Otherwise , the effect of spontaneity may be  | entirely lost and the success of the entire training program endangered . A few loose sheets or cards on the table before him are all that is appropriate for reference purposes . If he needs a " crib " in order to remember certain points to be brought up , he may write a few words in pencil on the appropriate blank wall charts , so lightly that they can not be detected by his audience . Another device is to list important chart points on a small sheet of paper which is wrapped around a marking crayon and fastened with a transparent Scotch tape . This can be held in the palm of the hand and covertly referred to from time to time . Keeping a Notebook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ index arranged by topics in which he records interesting discussion material . Specific topics in which the group is interested may be jotted down as they are encountered in the course of reading or conversation . Of particular value are cases or pertinent stories . Reference material of this kind may also include articles , pictures or cartoons from magazines or newspapers and abstracts from books dealing with the handling of men or business management . A wide-awake leader will find it helpful to keep abreast of current events in the field of human relations and to do considerable reading on the side . In this connection he will do well to familiarize himself with the books listed in Appendix A. Preparation of Supplementary Outlines If special conferences dealing with particular problems with which the group may be concerned are called for , additional research and preparation is required of the leader . For such a discussion he needs to obtain all necessary factual information and ascertain the opinions of interested persons in the course of discussions with them . He then needs to determine what chart headings would be useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will serve as a guide in steering the discussion . The tentative outline and charts usually need to be submitted for their comment to such executives in the organization as are concerned with the problem . If possible , the proposed outline should also be reviewed with a few selected and informed individuals prior to its use in group discussion . Further revision may be found necessary before presenting the topic . In preparing a specialized topic , the leader will find it helpful to assign an assistant to act as a " case collector " in contacting supervisors or employees for case material , facts , and opinions needed by the leader in his preparatory work . Many competent discussion leaders , well able to express themselves orally , can not do so in writing . In preparing new discussion material it may therefore be necessary to supply them with editorial assistance .  | New discussion outlines , together with charts , such as are contained in Part II , can be drafted " on paper " by an editor with the help of a conference leader , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The following principles may be found of assistance in the preparation of new or supplementary outlines : REQUIREMENTS IN PREPARING UNITS OF DISCUSSION OUTLINES i . Uniform structural pattern ? each unit outline to include : a . Statement of purposes b . Preface embracing ( i ) Definitions of important terms ( 2 ) Suggestions on starting the discussion c . Discussion plan ( i ) Suggested comments and questions for use with each aspect of discussion d . Conclusions ? important points for summarizing e . Typical blackboard charts to be used as a guide by the leader and subsequently distributed to trainees 2 . Independence ? each unit to be as self-contained and complete as possible within time limit available , without duplicating other outlines . 8 . Internal consanguinity ? all parts of subject matter to be closely related , interdependent , and tied together in appropriate sequence . 4 . Timing ? to contain sufficient subject matter for a two hour discussion . Outline should specify amount of time to be devoted to each of its cornponcnt parts . 5 . Specificity ? abstract ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with concrete illustrations or case material pertinent to the work of the discussion group . 6 . Simplicity of language ? homespun phrases to be used wherever possible and academic terms avoided . 7 . Applicability ? each unit must provide suggestions for applying the principles discussed to the actual work of the supervisors concerned . 8 . Summary charts ? these should have appropriate , descriptive titles , be selfexplanatory when considered alone , and as concise as possible .  | THE EVALUATION OF RESULTS The Need for Probative Evidence In reviewing what has been accomplished in training supervisors or foremen too little attention has been given in the past to the importance of making sure that the methods of inventory and appraisal used were precise and conclusive . The disposition to loose thinking which has characterized many training discussions has also characterized the problem of evaluating the results of the training program and the work of individual discussion leaders . Executives in touch with the training program have all too frequently mistaken a lively but ephemeral interest on the part of those enrolled as an evidence of acquired learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or trainees ? have been accepted without insistence that such opinions be backed by objective or measurable results . Completion of a training course should be followed by the preparation of an objective balance sheet . The problem of determining the effects of a discussion series may be approached from two points of view . In its broader aspect , evaluation may be directed to the benefits derived by the organization as such and by the individual supervisors in training . It is pertinent to ascertain whether the meetings have actually molded the attitudes or behavior of those participating in a manner beneficial to the end purposes and objectives of the organization . Inquiry should also be made as to what changes or improvements in operating procedure have become apparent . In looking at the problem of appraisal from a broad perspective , the objectives of foremanship training and the basic purposes of education in general set forth in Chapter I on page 7 should not be forgotten . The factors listed there will be of value in suggesting to the reader the scope which an all-inclusive evaluation must embrace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executives directly responsible for a training program are vitally concerned is that of gauging the performance of the discussion leader in the conduct of his meetings . How well does he meet certain standards ? If 79  | the method of determinate discussion is used , his performance should live up to the requirements of technique set forth in earlier chapters . What is the reaction of his groups to his leadership ? What does he do or fail to do to reap the maximum benefits for those whom he leads in discussion ? Objective Measures of Accomplishment Training results should therefore preferably be measurable in terms of tangible units and specific evidence rather than in terms of subjective opinion . This is not always possible , however . In some organizations the value of supervisor training can be definitely ascertained if a comparison is made of various operating data before and after training is undertaken . Records of production both as to quality and quantity may disclose improvement which can be attributed to training . It may be possible to demonstrate that costs have been reduced . Less overtime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A reduction in labor turnover may perhaps result from training . There may be fewer complaints or grievances registered with the employment office or labor trouble may be reduced . Service ratings or other measures of individual capacity may be used before and after training . Another objective measure of training results , if the attendance at the supervisors ' meetings has been entirely voluntary , is the record of attendance at the meetings . If this has been better than 8o per cent of those enrolled and has remained at a high figure throughout the training course , the record is significant in indicating the interest of and benefits to the trainees . Attendance in a successful discussion series tends to improve as the course proceeds . Such objective measures of the tangible yardstick variety are usually available in a factory manufacturing a line of staple products , in a merchandising organization , or in an office in which units of operating performance can be standardized . Any indices of this kind which are at hand should be used . It is important , however , in using them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concomitant factors . Benefits can be attributed to supervisor training and measured in objective terms only if other factors are segregated or held constant ' . The nature of the work in many business firms and governmental agencies unfortunately does not permit precise evaluation of this kind . Difficulties are at once encountered if a factory is employed on special orders rather than a standard product or if production is highly seasonal . Building construction projects are rarely identical and training results in terms of yards of concrete poured , bricks laid , or yardage excavated may be open to question . Subjective Evidence or Opinion In those situations in which output or other objectively measurable factors can not be analyzed to determine training results , resort may  | have to be had to the opinions of executives and of trainees , more or less supported by factual evidence . There is a great deal of subjective evidence of this kind already available to the effect that properly conducted discussions have value . Comments such as t se which follow , taken from an early report of the Chamber of Gnmerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' : " Foreman training vital to our production life and improvement . " " Unanimous approval of our management and foremen . " " Produced a higher grade of factory executive and prepared men to accept positions of greater responsibility . " " Improvements that developed in our personnel very noticeable . " " Every bit of effort applied in this direction has proven of value to us . " " Efficiency of our organization was almost immediately improved . " " We feel that the men finishing this course broadened their intellect and thus became more valuable men to the company . " " Broadening to executives as well as foremen . " Similar expressions of opinion have been made by executives in governmental and business organizations which have recently used the method of determinate discussion . In addition to considerable evidence as to increased output , noticeable reductions in accident frequency rates have been reported , and complaints and grievances are said to have fallen off materially . Numerous improvements and changes in operating procedure have grown directly out of foremanship training courses in the Federal service . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Projects Administration relative to the training of project foremen undertaken over a period of several years , the following abstracts are typical : Evidence of the benefit derived by the foremen can be readily seen from the marked increased interest they take in their jobs and in their work as well as increased efficiency in handling their men . Increased efficiency and production in project operation easily attributable to training . The training . . . has been far beyond bur expectation in the way of increased understanding between supervisory personnel and workers which has resulted in greater efficiency and production . Foremen attending . . . have shown definite development . . . resulting in increased morale and improved efficiency . . . excerpts from reports of superintendents speak for themselves . Several hundred letters , all with one accord , express . . . surprise over the many simple things brought out in the conferences they had neglected to take into account in the past . Keener consciousness of their responsibility on the part of the foremen and healthier mental outlook on the part of the worker , better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in their work and a feeling of greater solidarity among themselves .  | Possibly the opinion of Lieutenant-General Brehon Somervell , New York City Administrator for the works program from 1937-1940 and under whom some 9,000 supervisors and foremen were trained in accordance with the present writer 's principle of determinate discussion may be of interest as an example of valid subjective evidence : Prior to the initiation of the Training Program the foremen , particularly in the lower brackets , were so far removed from the administration that many policies and objectives of the organization were either hazy or misconstrued . By the same token , the necessity for following certain procedures was commonly unknown . A combination of these factors had the discouraging result to the foremen of being over-ridden , in many instances , when they were morally right but technically wrong . This naturally brought about a general weakening of morale with the attendant laxity in discipline . The primary accomplishment of the Training Program is believed to be found in the fact that the foreman , learning the broad policies of the organization , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accordance with established procedure . The knowledge being gained by the foremen of what goes on behind the scenes and of the problems faced by their superiors .. . is bringing about a better understanding of these problems and how they may assist in their solution . In short , the foreman is learning how to do his job in the most effective way and the former feeling of doubt with which he attacked his problems is being dispelled and replaced with one of confidence . In addition to this , an estimable amount of good is being derived from the closer association of the men who are brought together in the Training Conferences . This has , in a large measure , created a spirit of cooperation and good fellowship . The discussion of common problems and the method of arriving at proper solutions through their own thinking , under guidance of the conference leaders has enabled the more intelligent foremen to recognize and strengthen many of their own weaknesses . Unwitting mistakes which have , in some instances , become common practice are being uncovered and corrected . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Training Program can not be accurately determined , a noticeable improvement has been made . Many foremen are learning for the first time that a better day 's work can be secured from the men under their supervision through creation of an interest in the work rather than by " driving . " Moreover , the improvement in the foreman 's morale through better understanding of his job has encouraged the higher bracket supervisors to place more responsibility on the foremen thereby relieving themselves of many minor details and permitting them to devote proper time and thought to the more important phases of the work . It is interesting to note that when the Training Program was first started it was met with considerable derision from the men attending but that after the first few meetings the perspective changed to one of genuine interest as the value of the course became recognized . Offhand opinions of training results are worth a great deal more when supported by specific incidents . The following arc suggestive of  | the type which , if numerous enough , are practically equivalent to objective evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hardest , profanest foremen in a small factory town . In fact , he had been arrested for disturbing the peace by swearing too volubly in public . Although he got results , he was intensely disliked by his workers . After going through a training course dealing with the handling of men , he obtained a better job in another organization . His new plant superintendent telephoned the old and said : " What in the world did you do to Jones ? I would n't know he was the same man . He no longer swears at his men , he gets more work done , and the boys say he is a great guy to work for . " A construction superintendent reported having three foremen " who were n't worth shooting . " After they had participated for some time in a training course , the superintendent reported : " They 're turning into damn good foremen . " Measuring Trainees ' Attitudes Although of a subjective nature , the opinion of those in training can be determined at the close of a training course and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind can be statistically tabulated when it is obtained by means of an attitude questionnaire filled out by the trainees . To such a form they should not sign their names in order that an altogether candid opinion may be obtained . A questionnaire form based on the work of Shellow and Harmon which has been found to be of value in this connection appears below .

Indicate why  | After completing a course of sixteen or more determinate discussions , various groups of supervisors were asked to fill out a questionnaire similar to the foregoing . The responses of these groups , involving a total of more than 2,000 supervisors and foremen , indicated that from 85 per cent to g6 per cent of those enrolled felt that the meetings were well worthwhile . More than go per cent of them asked for a continuation of the training , and more than a majority of the trainees stated that they had definitely changed their method of handling their subordinates in one or more respects as a result of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Purdue University in which about 500 foremen and supervisors cooperated . Among the findings of this attitude survey were that 92 per cent of the foremen reported better understanding of top management and other official problems , . go per cent reported increased knowledge of the job , 8o per cent better coordination between departments , and 65 per cent stimulation of thought toward product . Other benefits to which lesser importance was attached included safer or improved working conditions , use of labor saving methods , reduction of fatigt.e , increased production , and reduction of overhead . Comparative Ratings of Trainee Performance If a reliable plan of service ratings or efficiency ratings is in use in the organization which is training its supervisors , an analysis of such ratings may provide a useful means of evaluation . It may then be possible to compare the performance reports of the supervisors prior to the inauguration of the training program with a subsequent rating made after training has been under way for several months . The distribution of performance report ratings of a control group which is not being trained may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training , provided the work of the two groups of supervisors is comparable and ratings are made by the same individual . The complex problem of service ratings has not yet been solved satisfactorily . Few of the forms used in this connection are sufficiently objective . The reader who is interested in the technical aspects of constructing and validating performance reports may obtain further information from standard texts on personnel administration , or from the Civil Service Assembly of the United States and Canada , affiliated with the University of Chicago . In order for him to gain an idea of the type of service rating form which has been found useful in appraising the performance of supervisors , it may be of interest examine the form and accompanying instructions which appear n the following pages . The scale in question was developed in colla ration with Fred Telford , former director of the Civil Service Assen bly . It has been used successfully to measure the improvement in the I See Service Ratings by J. B. Probst ; Civil Service Assembly , Chicago , 19M.  | work of supervisors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of supervisors who were not trained . Arbitrary weights can be assigned to the items in the performance report form shown here . For example , weights from o to 4 can be used in scoring the first nineteen traits listed in the rating scale . The quantity and quality of production can , if desired , be assigned higher weights . Positive weights can also be assigned to the traits shown in paragraphs 20 and 21 and negative weights to the items in paragraphs 22 and 23 . After a distribution of scores has been obtained for any group of supervisors rated , a critical score for satisfactory performance is then fixed on the basis of the distribution . A simple though statistically questionable method of scoring the form is to allow the following weights for items checked in the traits numbered from i to ig : ( a ) items , score o ; ( b ) items , score i ; ( c ) items , score 3 ; ( d ) items , score 6 ; and ( e ) items , score io . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For each point checked in group 21 , subtract 5 points . If this plan of scoring is followed , the total scores may be roughly appraised as follows : 141 or higher ? superior tot to 141 ? good 41 to ioo ? average or fair . 1 to 40 ? poor , below par o or less ? inferior The form here discussed has definite value in comparing the total scores of supervisors rated by the same reporting officer , but unless an involved statistical procedure is used , it should not be considered reliable in comparing the scores of supervisors or foremen in different departments if rated by different executives . The use of any rating form needs to be further safeguarded by providing preliminary training for the reporting officers and by making an item analysis of the various traits checked for each group of supervisors rated by the same individual to ensure that his ratings are unbiased.  | INSTRUCTIONS FOR FILLING OUT THE PERFORMANCE REPORT r . The Purpose of the Report . The purpose of the performance report is to secure a statement showing how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done his work during the period of several months preceding the time the report is made out . The report is made by the superintendent or other officer who knows well the work of the supervisor . 2 . Items to Be Checked . The officer who makes the report checks with a cross ( X ) all the items in the report that to his own knowledge describe the work , performance , attitude , habits , and conduct of the supervisor . Check only one item in groups r to 19 . Check as many items as apply in groups 20 and 22 . If none of the items in any group applies or has any bearing on the work , do not check any item in that group . In any case do not check an item unless you can promptly and easily cite at least two or three specific facts or occurrences to justify your checking . If you are entirely unable to make out the report because you are not familiar with the supervisor 's performance write a note to that effect , attach it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the person from whom you received the report . DO NOT GUESS . 3 . Standards to Be Used in Checking . The report for any supervisor is not to be based on some personal or absolute standard but by comparison with others doing the same kind of work . In making your check marks , compare the supervisors on whom you report with one another . 4 . Underlining Certain Words and Phrases . If the a item in group 4 is checked , the Superintendent may , if he so desires , underline the word unfair or the word harsh . Similarly , a word or phrase in certain items in groups 9 , Ii , and 18 may be underlined in order to clarify the report . 5 . The Number of Items Checked . It has been found that , as a rule , most supervisors check one item in every one of the groups numbered from t to rg . In groups 20 and 22 most supervisors check from two to six items . 6 . Choosing the Degree of Any Trait to Be Checked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accuracy with which the superintendent chooses the item to be checked from among the five listed in any group ( other than groups 20 and 22 ) . Some Superintendents , it has been found , are inclined to report little or nothing that is unfavorable to the supervisor and to exaggerate his good points . Others , fewer in number , report little or nothing that is favorable and exaggerate the bad points . Both are in error and do themselves and their supervisors an injustice . Superintendents should recognize and keep in mind the truth of the following : a . All supervisors , however good on the whole , with very rare exceptions have faults or shortcomings . b . All supervisors , however poor on the whole , with very rare exceptions h points in which they excel . c . For any group of supervisors , with very rare exceptions , the number of standingly good points and outstandingly bad points are roughly equal . d . Only one or two foremen in a group of , say , ten can be " outstandingly " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If more than one or two in the group possess the trait to that degree , they cease to be exceptional or outstanding . In well prepared reports for a group of supervisors , about half of all the check marks ( except for groups 20 and 22 ) are opposite the c item ; about a fifth each are opposite the h and rl items respectively . The remaining marks are about equally divided between a and e items . ut-  | figure  | It is also possible for superintendents or engineers in frequent touch with the work of various supervisors or foremen enrolled in the training course to record their impressions of the attitude of individual supervisors and of the workers under them on a less formal check sheet . A record of this kind can be used as one of the bases for an alphabetical or rank order rating of performance . A form which has been used in this connection is as follows : figure Formal Tests for Trainees It is generally undesirable to conduct formal tests or examinations to ascertain how much information supervisors have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent to which their judgment in human relationships has improved . A formal examination for adults smacks too much of the schoolroom and is likely to be resented . On the other hand , under certain circumstances , it may serve a needed purpose to have a group of supervisors go through some procedure of this kind at the close of various units of the training course . If the test used is a valid one , the resultant test scores may be recorded on the supervisors ' employment records and considered as one of the bases for advancement or lay-off . If a test is not used to determine  | the precise extent to which the trainees have absorbed new ideas , it should be prefaced by explaining to them that the procedure is in the nature of an informal review rather than an examination . Such an explanation removes the sting no matter for what purpose the test is used . The construction of adequate tests introduces another specialized problem of personnel administrative technique which has its difficulties . Free answer questions of the ordinary type , to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unreliable for accurate testing purposes . They are suitable for review purposes only . Short answer tests can be used if they are carefully devised and validated by someone definitely experienced in their construction . A sample of a short answer test blank used to determine the knowledge of supervisors who have completed a course of discussions in the handling of men will be found in Appendix B. For further information regarding the technique of test construction , it will be necessary to refer to handbooks on the psychology of employment and education . Reviewing the Discussion Topics If a forjnal check-up in the way of an examination is not considered advisable in the course of the training program , and this is frequently the case , it may be found helpful for the discussion leader to devote a meeting or part of a meeting every few weeks to general questions designed to review the subject matter which has been discussed . This is worthwhile if it can be done without a loss of interest . In this connection , general questions of the free answer type can be used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpful if members of the group are themselves encouraged to propose questions concerned with points on which they desire further enlightenment . Suggestive of the nature of questions which can be used for review purposes are the following : " What are the most important ' don'ts ' in reprimanding a worker ? Under what circumstances are written orders useful ? What are some of the advantages of a systematic plan of job training for workers , both to the worker and the management ? Cite several definite measures which may serve to check up on the results accomplished by a supervisor . " Appraising the Leader 's Performance In addition to an appraisal of training benefits to management and supervisors as discussed in the foregoing pages , considerable insight into the success or failure of a series of training discussions may he obtained by observing the discussion leader in action . The reliability of such observation naturally depends upon the extent of the observer 's knowledge of discussion technique . Even an uninformed visitor gains some impression of the leader 's competence and if the visitor is well acquainted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific validity .  | Any intelligent person dropping in on a discussion can readily sense whether the group members are absorbing new ideas and learning to think logically . From the group 's behavior , he can determine whether a mood of good humor is prevalent , whether there is a mood of expectancy , of interest , and helpful cooperation , and whether or not the leader evidences traits of personality which make for tension , misunderstanding , or for authoritarianism . He may also observe whether or not there is a sense of general agreement on the part of the group members as to the conclusions at which they have arrived , or , on the other hand , whether numerous questions are raised but remain unanswered . In considering the more technical aspects of the conference leader 's skill it may first be of interest to consider the composite opinion of a number of groups of leaders . Such groups have suggested the two charts which follow as indicative of the positive and negative aspects of group leadership . HOW CAN A LEADER 'S CONFERENCE WORK BE EVALUATED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of contributors Frequency of participation 2 .

A typical example of such a report form is shown on the following page . The chart for rating a discussion here shown is not sufficiently objective or detailed although it has been found helpful . Of lesser use in evaluating the leader 's performance , although somewhat more objective , is the use of a form which lists the various devices used by him , such as direction questions , overhead questions , cases - cited , stories told , summation of opinion , returning questions to group for discussion , etc . Opposite each can be recorded the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its effectiveness in promoting discussion . A type of objective rating form which is probably of greater value in determining the leader 's success , particularly in conducting the newer type of discussion with which we are here concerned , is the one headed " Evaluation of Leader 's Performance , " shown on pages 96 and 97 . All of the factors on this form are negative . Total scores are of relative significance if comparisons are made of the work of several leaders . Variations in total scores of less than ten points as  | CHART FOR RATING DISCUSSION LED BY DATE RATING 1 . How well was the discussion distributed ? Did most of the group members participate ? 2 .

Poor Fair I Good Excel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weights are arbitrarily assigned . A detailed analysis of the items checked is far more significant than a final score . One or two superlative shortcomings recorded on a scale of this kind may be sufficiently serious to characterize the entire work of a leader as ineffective . In a sizeable training program involving the employment of a number of discussion leaders , it is helpful for the training supervisor to leave a copy of his evaluation report with the leader whose work has been observed . It should be suggested to the leader that he give additional attention to the items checked in order to improve his work . The rating scale here shown can also be used to good advantage by a leader who desires to evaluate his own performance . A Word in Summary In concluding this consideration of various methods for measuring the success of discussion technique it may be appropriate to paraphrase the conclusion of Thomas Fansler in his Discussion Methods for Adult Groups , stated in response to the question : " What is good discussion technique ? " Modifying this conclusion to our immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Procedure , leadership qualifications , subject-matter , training of the audience , and certain psychological attitudes ? all of these are important . For those who desire a definite answer , I shall state it as simply as I can : Good technique is that which with a given leader , a given subject , a given audience , evokes such likely , stimulating , thought-provoking and conclusive discussion as will achieve those desirable educational objectives that tend toward more rational , more self-conscious , more purposeful supervision and leadership in business , industry , and government . " The outlines in Part II of this volume may serve as an introductory course toward the achievement of the objectives outlines in abstract terms in the foregoing paragraph . Discussion should be directed to the individual problems of the organization in which they are used and should , most importantly , be followed up by additional meetings from which those participating will be able to see their conference translated into specific action and accomplishment .

Rated by  | STEPS IN ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION Determining the Need for Training Any organization which is exploring the possibilities of training its supervisory personnel must first decide who arc to be trained and in what they are to be trained . In determining the answers to these questions and in arriving at a sound conclusion as to the degree of need for training , several approaches may be considered by the individual charged with the responsibility for setting up a training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the various departments or branches of the organization . He will do well to become acquainted with any activities in the field of job analysis or job classification and with standards of performance and service ratings , as applied to supervisory personnel . Such study may suggest the nature and the need of training and throw light on the composition of the training groups . Before initiating a plan of training in the essentials of supervision , it is helpful to analyze employee complaints which may reveal managerial shortcomings . Surveys should be made of any earlier training programs which may have been undertaken . Of substantial value is a survey of the opinion of those to be trained . When a training plan is contemplated , it is far better to give the supervisors involved a voice in its initiation and to suggest an interest in and a desire for training , than for the management to announce that it is launching a training program . Otherwise , the proposal may appear to reflect criticism by the management of the competency of its supervisors . It may be possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and there among interested supervisors who are likely to advance the idea . When the supervisors themselves have a part in initiating the training plan , they will naturally feel considerable responsibility for its success or failure . It is generally deemed advisable to start a training plan by providing instruction in the fundamental principles of human relations since these are basic factors in supervision . From the outlines in Part II a selection of sixteen or more appropriate topics can be made . In this connection , it is suggested that the outlines numbered 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 9 , 98  | 11 , 13 , 14 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 22 , 23 , 30 , 31 , and 32 should be given first consideration in the sequence listed . These topics will be found helpful in practically every type of administrative manufacturing , or merchandising organization . Depending upon the peculiar training needs of the organization more or less time may be spent on certain topics . In one company there may be need for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In another , labor relations , safety , or planning may be worthy of further detailed treatment . After a list of basic discussion topics has been decided upon , it may also be desirable to set aside certain sessions of the proposed training curriculum for a discussion of specialized operating problems peculiar to the organization concerned . These should not be introduced until onethird or one-half of the standard discussion outlines have been presented . Place of Training in the Organization The training director and the activities under him may be assigned to the sdpervision of one or another of the organization 's executives . The training function should be under the immediate supervision of a high ranking official but an independent unit may not be necessary . Large organizations have established educational divisions which may or may not come within the province of the personnel department . The personnel officer usually occupies an independent position ' in the organization and the training program can logically be placed under his wing . In a very small organization where training can be undertaken with the assistance of one or two discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or under a superintendent in charge of operations . It is possible for several agencies to cooperate and jointly utilize the services of one discussion leader . Such a leader may be an educational director furnished by a manufacturers ' association , chamber of commerce or the public school system , or he may be cooperatively employed by a group of local companies . Generally speaking , the services of a discussion leader used exclusively by a single company have proven more satisfactory than those of an outsider . Leaders recruited from outside sources are not acquainted with the peculiar problems of the plant or industry and may be viewed with suspicion by the supervisors . If a school man is used , the supervisors will assume the critical attitude which practical men frequently take toward another coming from an academic field . It is sometimes feasible to launch a training program under the auspices of a foremen 's club of which there are hundreds throughout the United States . Desirable as such organizations are , the club form of organization tends to the presentation of set programs rather than discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clubs . When specific training is required for the supervisors of a given  | organization , precise and thorough-going results can hardly be expected if the plan is turned over to a foremen 's club , which is naturally an unofficial agency . Such organizations are more helpful in carrying on an intermittent training program after a basic training course has been completed under the auspices of the employer . The Composition of Discussion Groups A preliminary study of training needs will indicate the extent to which various grades or groups of supervisory personnel are to be included in the program . The group almost invariably given first consideration is that of supervisors or foremen in direct charge of the workers ; those ordinarily known by these titles . Whether the training program should embrace supervisors and executives of higher rank and whether it should include sub-foremen , squad bosses , and understudies will depend upon their need for training and the available training facilities and leadership personnel . Executive training is frequently all important but disregarded . By virtue of the positions they hold , higher executives are usually conceded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too busy for such activity . On the other hand , many executives of long experience do profit materially by participating in a training course in human relations . Furthermore , top executives need to be in close touch with and thoroughly informed about the nature of the training discussions in which their subordinates are engaged . Otherwise , a conflict may result between those of executive rank and those of supervisory rank , not only in interpreting procedures but in the philosophy of management itself . In many growing organizations or those in which supervisor turnover is heavy , provision needs to be made for including prospective supervisors or understudies in the training program . Not more than a third of any discussion group should ordinarily consist of understudies since such men do not have enough experience to contribute to the group 's deliberations . The size of a discussion group should be from fifteen to twenty-five with an average of about twenty . With an enrollment of less than ten supervisors , it is difficult to obtain a diversity of experience and of opinion to generate interesting discussion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since groups of larger size make it impossible for each individual to have sufficient opportunity for participation . In the case of a company having but a handful of supervisors or foremen , it becomes necessary to cooperate with other plants in a training program or to include within the group membership a certain number of higher executives or of understudies . In some instances , it is also possible to enroll such outsiders as may have ideas to contribute . For example , local consulting engineers , city officials , personnel men , high school vocational instructors , or Y. M. C. A.  | secretaries may be interested in meeting with a group to discuss problems of handling men . In determining to which of several discussion groups a supervisor can be assigned , consideration needs to be given to the supervisor 's rank , the nature of his work , and his capacity to absorb training and to express himself . Generally speaking , if a sufficient number of supervisors of a given rank or classification are available for inclusion within a homogeneous group , this should be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his superior , the latter 's presence may hamper the free expression of opinion . Some executives tend to dominate a discussion and their very presence may prohibit satisfactory discussion . However , in some smaller organizations where supervisors and executives generally call each other by their first names and in which relationships are on a democratic basis , excellent results are obtained when officials of all ranks meet together . The question of whether supervisors or foremen engaged in related occupational fields should meet together or whether occupational diversity should be sought is one which must be answered in the light of the local situation . If all the men in the discussion group are supervising almost identical work , the experience which they offer and the cases which they can relate tend to narrow the discussion . It is frequently better to bring together representatives of various trades or fields of work within the same group in order to broaden their point of view . Supervisors and foremen should not be arbitrarily assigned to a discussion group without some consideration of the way in which they will fit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personnel records , applications , tests , or service ratings may throw light on that point and on the capacity of a given supervisor to profit by the discussion . Too many markedly dull individuals should not be assigned to an otherwise intelligent group and retard its progress . A related consideration is that of the trainee 's capacity to express himself . Ordinarily shy or retiring men should be distributed through several discussion groups if a number of groups are to be organized . On the other hand , it has been found that when reticent individuals are placed together within one discussion group , without publicity having been given to such a course of action , the members of that group develop surprising skill in self-expression . They become more talkative than they would have had they been grouped with other , talkative men . As a corollary , experiments may be tried in distributing the over-talkative supervisors over several groups or including them all within a single group . In some organizations both men and women can be included in the same discussion group but in general it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourage greater freedom of expression . A mixed group should ordinarily be led by a man .  | Enrolling the Trainees After a decision has been made as to what grades of supervisors are to be included in the training program , two other questions arise in conjunction with the matter of enrollment . Should all supervisors of certain ranks be included or should a distinction be made in selecting them ? Should attendance at the meetings be voluntary or compulsory ? In general , experience suggests that a democratic rather than an autocratic approach to the prospective trainees is to be preferred . In many situations , it is best to open the proposed training course to any supervisors who may be genuinely interested . However , anyone who enrolls should be told that , having done so , regular attendance is expected of him . In other situations , the training may be restricted to those most in need of it . It is an easy matter to issue instructions for all supervisors to participate in a training course , but compulsion may kill the interest of the participants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it must be on company time as is explained in the following section . When the element of choice is permitted to enter into the question of an individual 's enrollment , the training program is " on the spot , " so to speak , for the production of results . Interest and attendance then definitely depend upon the skill with which the discussions are conducted and the benefits they confer . The training program must stand on its own feet in sustaining interest and enthusiasm ; the resultant psychological effect is wholesome . The less pressure , therefore , that is brought to bear , the better the reaction of the trainees . In general , voluntary attendance is to be preferred unless it is found that a considerable number of supervisors badly in need of training are the very ones who would not enroll unless they are compelled to . To bring the trainees together for an initial meeting a form letter is ordinarily addressed them inviting them to take part in a series of meetings given over to discussions of the day-to-day questions with which as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participation will be of value both to the enrollee and to the organization . It should indicate the time and place of the first meeting . Scheduling the Meetings Questions relating to the number , the frequency , the length , and the time of meetings will depend upon various local needs and circumstances . As to the extent of the training course , little training of consequence in the fundamentals of supervision can be achieved in a series of less than sixteen sessions . A definite time limit for the training course should be made known to enrollees at the outset . If additional meetings are desired by the training group , arrangements can be made to hold additional discussions dealing with human relations , with special operating problems , or semi-technical topics .  | In the experience of organizations engaged in training , meetings held once a week at regularly scheduled times are probably most productive . Meetings held oftener may be burdensome . They do not provide time for absorption of ideas or information or for supplementary reading if that is encouraged . Meetings held every two weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spaced two weeks or more apart , there may be a lack of sustained interest and of continuity . When a number of new or prospective supervisors are in need of emergency training , it may of course be necessary to provide intensive preliminary training for several hours a day for a week or two , as was done in the T. W. I. courses . Sessions of two hours will enable a leader to cover a given topic thoroughly . The outlines in Part II are designed for this period of time . Discussions of an hour are too short to permit intensive discussion but in unusual circumstances it may be necessary to fix a time limit of an hour and a half. , The two-hour period can be gone through without a lag in interest or a rest pause . A longer time is likely to be exhausting and destructive of interest . Meetings should start on time . They should stop promptly at the appointed time unless a number of the supervisors desire to prolong the discussion a little longer . The time selected for group discussion may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is entirely voluntary and the work day is short , meetings may be scheduled immediately at the close of work . For training sessions of a voluntary nature , evening meetings are frequently more satisfactory . They are entered into in a more leisurely spirit free from the tense atmosphere of the workshop or office . On company time , some industrial plants have conducted successful meetings just before the lunch hour and others early in the afternoon . Until recently , a considerable number of manufacturing plants held meetings at the close of the work day , half of the session being on company time and half on the employees ' time . Whether or not the training of supervisors can be undertaken outside of the regular 40 hour workweek without payment for overtime will depend upon the category into which the supervisors in a given firm have been placed by the Wage and Flours Administrator of the U. S. Department of Labor . Under a normal interpretation of the Administrator 's rulings as set forth in " Explanatory Bulletin , Regulations Part 541 , " it would appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) are exempt from the Wage and Hours Act since they are employed in a " bona fide executive , administrative capacity " as defined in the wage and hour regulations and the Labor Management Relations Act of 1945 . If so , supervisory conferences could be held in or out of normal working hours . Whether or not training needs to be paid for in a given situation  | may have to be taken up with the Department of Labor , Washington , D. C. , unless those in training are clearly outside the scope of the Fair Labor Standards Act . The Selection of Discussion Leaders Individuals of high grade are needed as conference leaders since upon their work largely depends the success or failure of the training plan . Their work demands definite qualifications of leadership depending particularly upon personal traits . A summary of their desirable qualifications is as follows : 1 . High school education , preferably college training in business administration , personnel management , teaching or engineering . 2 . Adaptability and intelligence , with a practical rather than academic attitude of mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 3 . Integrity , open mindedness , high ethical standards . 4 . Ability to influence the attitude and orderly thinking of others . In the broad sense ? a teacher rather than an instructor . 5 . Demonstrated leadership ability . One who comes to the front in any group of persons with whose activity he is associated . 6 . Age of such years that maturity in thought and experience will be recognized by members of the conference group . 7 . Pleasing personality and " presence " as related to personal appearance , manners , with earnestness and consistency in relationships . 8 . Experience in and knowledge of the fundamentals of foremanship acquired through successful supervision of working groups . g . Acquaintance with the purpose , organization and operations of the agency or company and the working and economic conditions of employees . Considerable inquiry into the past experience of a prospective leader , especially his ability to get along with others , is of value in selecting him . A primary qualification is that of mental alertness since quick thinking is necessary in conducting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this connection . Above all , a leader must be able to express himself , to be articulate . Leaders who can be assigned from four to eight discussion groups a week and devote full time to such work will naturally be able to specialize in it and achieve greater results . The opportunity to specialize permits them to do better work than line executives for whom it may be just another detail . The use of one or more leaders of this kind is of course impossible in all but large organizations . In smaller ones , group leadership may be combined with other functions , provided there is a definite recognition of such work as a part-time responsibility . As to the rank within the organization of the discussion leader , it is probable that an alert , outstanding supervisor of much the same rank as those with whom he meets will prove most satisfactory . It is true that an executive of higher rank assigned to act as a leader carries prestige and suggests a recognition of managerial interest in the  | training program . However most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because of their position , they may tend to influence or dominate the discussion too much . High-powered executives very frequently dominate those with whom they come in contact even though such domination be unconscious . Many of them have also acquired autocratic mannerisms which destroy the spontaneity of discussion . Exceptions there are of course . Some excellent conference leaders from the executive force have been found in staff rather than a line capacity . In the last analysis , the personality of an individual should be the determining factor in deciding whether or not he may become a competent discussion leader . In arousing the interest of prospects under consideration for work as discussion leaders , it may be pertinent to suggest to them that a position of this kind has a number of advantages . Because of its contact with the key men in tl+e organization and its responsibility , it carries considerable prestige . The increase in the number of women workers and women supervisors during World War II raised the question of the suitability of women as discussion leaders . Although some employers insisted that meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority soon learned that women 's groups could best be headed by properly qualified women . In smaller establishments men and women supervisors met together ; in large organizations the women supervisors met in their own groups . If a number of discussion leaders are to be employed , their preparation will not be complete unless they have been brought together for at least a week and given intensive training in the fundamentals of discussion leadership . After basic principles have been considered , the greater part of such a training period should be devoted to practice work , in the course of which each leader tries his skill in conducting discussions of the others in the leader group . In this connection , it may be necessary to supplement a small number of leader prospects with other supervisors from the organization in order to swell the size of the audience . Requirements of a Satisfactory Meeting Room The room selected for group discussion should be accessible , comfortable , and definitely available when it is needed . Meetings can be held in various parts of a factory , warehouse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not be so unkempt or uncomfortable as to lower the prestige of the training program . The physical comfort of the trainees should be considered . Reasonably comfortable chairs should be py-avided , and are better than benches . The room should be clean , properly illuminated , and well ventilated . It should be free from disturbing noises of machinery or traffic . An informal atmosphere should be encouraged and smoking should be allowed .  | When satisfactory quarters are not available within the plant or office , it is sometimes possible to arrange for a meeting room in a public or community building , chamber of commerce , armory , or Y. M. C. A. Public schoolrooms should be used only as a last resort since they have a bad psychological effect . Narrow tables on which die supervisors can rest their elbows and on which notes may be taken are decidedly conducive to discussion . The proper arrangement of chairs and tables is all-important . If three tables are available , they should be arranged in the shape of a " U , " with the foreman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leader taking his place at the opening at the top . Behind him is the wall with its charts . When only a single long table is available for use , the foremen should be grouped around it leaving a small clear space at the middle of one side for the leader . Chairs of all the men present will face him , the men in the front of the table sitting sidewise . The leader should not attempt to use the end of the table since some of the men will be too far away . In discussion groups of this kind there is a constant tendency for members to sit in the back of the room or , if a wall is adjacent , to lean their chairs against it . From the very start of the meeting series , the discussion leader should firmly but courteously request the foremen to group themselves closely around the tables so that each may hear what every other man present has to say . Instead of having each man take the same seat at each meeting , it is better to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to time . To emphasize the informality of the meetings and place the men at their ease , they should be encouraged to attend in work clothes if they so desire and to remove their coats if they wish . At the outset there may be a disposition on the part of some men present to stand up when they have something to say . This should be discouraged . The Initial Meeting At the first meeting of a newly organized discussion group , about fifteen minutes should be devoted to preliminaries . The meeting should open with an introduction by an executive of responsible rank , the higher the better . He should briefly outline the nature of the proposed sessions and stress the fact that they are endorsed by the management . As an illustration of the remarks used to good advantage in this connection by an executive , the following may be of interest : " You men who have been asked to come here may be wondering what this is all about . To make use of the popular phrase that is going the round , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ? ' " We have made arrangements for groups of foremen and supervisors to get together once a week for two hours to.talk over questions which come up from day to day on the job . These discussions will not at this time be concerned  | with technical , operating , or trade questions . We are not going to talk about the new models for next season , how to set up machines , or how to read a blueprint . We are , however , going to take up the problems of supervision with which each of us is faced , regardless of the kind of project he is engaged on . Our discussions will in particular be concerned with questions arising in the handling of men . For example , what are you going to do with the man who simply does not take much interest in his work ? What can you do to break up idling on the job ? How can you train a green man without experience ? What about horseplay and practical jokes ? Are you doing all that you can to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet day after day . " We believe that you will be interested in this program because it gets right down to cases and deals with the things which may have been troubling you . One of the foremen down east who had been sitting in on these discussions was asked : Are you interested ? Are you getting any good out of this plan ? ' to which he replied : Is a man interested in a tack when he 's sitting on the point of it ? ' By that he meant to emphasize that this matter of effective supervision is a tack on which all are sitting . " Now in running these meetings there is n't going to be a school teacher or a long winded lecturer who is going to put you to sleep . There are n't going to be any pep talks . Some one has to preside over the meetings , however . Therefore , we have a group leader or discussion leader whose job it is to see that everybody with an idea gets a chance to express it and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time . " We want you to know that these meetings are your own meetings . You will talk about your own ideas and you will exchange experience and information . Let 's suppose that each of you has a dollar bill ? let 's imagine that you go ahead and start swapping those bills among yourselves . If you did that , you 'd make sure that you did n't let go of your bill until you got one in return . That 's the way it is with money or merchandise or materials ? to get something you have to give up something in exchange for it . But what about ideas ? If you pass on an idea to the other fellow , does it make it any less yours ? Now that 's the very point in holding this kind of meeting . You can get an idea from the other man and give him an idea of your own , and you both profit . You have two ideas instead of one and you 're that much better off . " As a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is our organization going to operate more effectively , but you men will have a chance to improve yourselves , to make yourselves more valuable to the company and to any private employer later on . As you all know , everyone desires promotion . The best jobs are going to the men that can think things through , who know how to handle men properly and who have ideas . Nobody wants to hire a chap who has n't had a new idea for twenty years . " This program of meetings is a fairly new idea with us , but it has been done in industry for the past many years . We are introducing it here because we believe that you men should have the chance to get better acquainted with each other and with the workings of our company . We believe that you will welcome an opportunity to improve yourselves for better jobs . " We expect you to be regular in your attendance at these meetings and to be on time . Whenever you do n't show up we are going to call your attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on file . When the time comes  | around for promotion , it is natural for us to assume that those supervisors who have profited through regular attendance at these meetings will be better qualified than those who have not seen fit to attend . " The executive may then leave the group with its leader in order to emphasize the fact that the meeting is the supervisors ' own . The leader should at this time make clear that the meetings are not classes , that the supervisors are not there because they need training , and point out that discussion is " privileged " in that anyone may say what he wishes in line with the matter under discussion . He may suggest the need for prompt and sustained attendance . If the supervisors are not acquainted with each other 's names , positions , and background , it is helpful for the leader to list this information in a summary wall chart tabulation . To this may be added a record of the number of years which each group member has had in supervising the work of others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups will run as high as two hundred or three hundred and in exceptional instances have been known to reach eight hundred . The leader may point out that , to the extent that it exchanges ideas and experience , the group can profit materially from the composite of experience recorded . Instruction Material In addition to the summary charts which follow the discussion outlines in Part II and which are mimeographed for distribution to the supervisors at the close of each meeting , it may be possible to provide other supplementary training aids . A small reference library containing selected volumes from the bibliography suggested in Appendix " A " may be of considerable interest . Other reference material such as magazines or magazine articles , newspaper clippings , trade or governmental reports can be routed from one member of the training group to another to good advantage . Outside reading and the taking of notes on the part of those participating should be encouraged , although foremen employed in lower grades of work naturally can not be expected to do much outside reading . Aside from the supplies needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of training program . It may be useful to supply the enrollees with inexpensive ring-binder notebooks in which the mimeographed charts and other notes can be preserved for reference use . Records and Reports Records of trainee attendance and reports of training activity should be simple but adequate . There is no purpose in burdening the discussion leader or a clerk with a great deal of " paper work . " The leader will find it of value to maintain a card index on 3X5 or 5x8  | figure  | figure figure  | cards showing the enrollee 's name , department , and a few other personnel facts abstracted from his employment record . A record of the attendance of each discussion group can be kept on a monthly form , a typical sample of which is shown on the next page . On the individual record card can be recorded the attendance percentage for various training courses in which the employee may have been enrolled and , if they are used , the scores of any tests which he may have taken . In larger training programs , particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is helpful for the leader to make out a daily report form . A typical example of such a form is also shown on a following page . Copies of this report should be sent to the executive to whom the leader reports and , if desired , to other interested executives . Special memoranda covering ideas or suggestions growing out of a group discussion can be prepared by the leader from time to time as the occasion arises . As part of the training record , the leader should retain the wall charts developed by the group for the uses suggested in Chapter VI . If desired , a typist may be assigned to copy the chart records rather than preserving the large sheets . Concluding a Discussion Series Upon concluding a training course of several months ' duration , it is frequently valuable to stage something in the way of a ceremony attended by higher officials . One or two executives can use the occasion to compliment the supervisors on their interest and pay tribute to their determination to improve themselves and their organization . Reference can also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating procedures and a suggestion put forth that those foremen who are interested may wish to continue further study to develop themselves for increased responsibility . Some organizations have adopted the practice of issuing a certificate of attendance to those completing a training course . Such certificates are prized by those consistent in their attendance . A reproduction of a typical certificate used by the Works Progress Administration in this connection is shown on another page . " Following-Through " To Ensure Results Many training programs have been in the nature of " shots-in-thearm " without permanent benefits because no provision was made for following them up to see that the principles taught were applied . This was particularly true with some of the T. W. I. service during World War II . To meet the need for follow-up some organizations have therefore designated their foremen trainers as a kind of superforemen with authority to contact members of their groups at work , assist them with their shop problems , and see that they use appropriate job-instructor and job-relations methods . They are charged with fol-  | lowing up on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for refresher training . This plan vastly improved the results obtained from supervisor training in those companies in which the leader-trainers possessed the necessary tact and personality and in which it was definitely understood that they had no concern whatever with operations . They succeeded when they confined their individual , . advisory services to helping the foremen solve their own problems without stepping over the line and giving them orders . They could suggest a number of alternate courses of action but left the final decision to the foreman himself . In other organizations where such a plan was tried the leaders ran head on into operating officials , were accused of meddling , and soon assigned to other duties . Need for Support of Management Any training program demands sustained interest and support from the management . Regular attendance at the training sessions ( especially if on company time ) should be considered in connection with promotions , salary increases , and possible demotions or lay-offs . Interested executives should keep in constant and close touch with the progress of the trainees . After the discussion groups have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drop in from time to time and actively demonstrate their interest in the program . Several hundred companies have undertaken successful training courses and then dropped them largely because its executives have lost touch with the program and have not taken steps to follow it up . Frequently , additional training is desirable but no one has been assigned to planning a further program or preparing new training material required . The success of a training program involves enthusiastic and intelligent supervision . If it is worth undertaking , it must be done well . Training may do more harm than good unless it is thoroughly done and the interest of those enrolled maintained at all times . A program should not be continued beyond a point where its success appears to be in question . Training entered into earnestly , carried on methodically , and supervised intelligently will soon demonstrate itself to be a continuing and indispensable responsibility of management .  | STAFF MEETINGS FOR EXECUTIVE DEVELOPMENT Determinate Discussion Technique Applied to Executives Any executive who brings together his " key-men " for consultation , for joint consideration and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most useful management techniques . When group participation is emphasized , the resultant benefits may prove surprising . A " yes-sir " attitude on the part of the group , on the other hand , neither stimulates creative thinking nor arouses a feeling of responsible participation in management . A meeting of subordinates used in part as a consultative conference is ordinarily not appreciated as a means of training executives in management and in leadership . Such conferences are termed " staff " meetings rather than " training " sessions ; executives generally resent the implication that they are being trained , even though they welcome an opportunity for executive development . Directing heads of many corporations may talk about the need for executive development , but only a few larger firms are establishing a systematic program in that field . Invaluable pioneering in this aspect of administration was done by the late Dr. Henry C. Metcalf , distinguished writer on personnel matters , who organized series of executive conferences on the nature and . qualifications of management . The foregoing chapters have been concerned primarily with formalized training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , much the same methods of conference presentation and leadership may also be applied advantageously to staff conferences of higher executives . It may therefore be pertinent briefly to explore the potentialities of the staff meeting as a means of effecting improvements both in business operation and in the managerial capacity of those in attendance . Limitations of the Customary Staff Meeting At most meetings there is a lot of business to be accomplished briefly and with as little argument as possible . Staff meetings in many organizations arc unfortunately greatly circumscribed in nature and scope 1 ; 3  | and are conducted in a distinctly autocratic manner . The busy executive in charge frequently barges into such a meeting at the last minute without having properly planned his agenda or scheduled enough time for an adequate discussion to arrive at sound conclusions . He may confine the meeting to a brusque announcement of new programs , plans , or policies which his subordinates are expected to accept , " or else . " In order to save time and emphasize his dominant position he may monopolize the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to what he wants done . His temperament or his zeal for his own ideas may be such that none of those present will have courage to question his proposals . Bland acceptance of his ideas is expected . This type of seemingly egotistic executive has found itself burlesqued in motion pictures . Such a pose is in direct antithesis to the personality of a genuine leader who invites comment and criticism from his colleagues and who wins their loyalty and respect in consequence of his democratic attitude . Many executives need to see themselves as others see them . Staff Meetings for Constructive Group Thinking A program of periodic staff meetings of executives with their immediate superior may have the following objectives : 1 . To receive information , orders , or instructions regarding work of the entire group ; 2 . To interpret information or instructions in order to insure uniform understanding and consistent application ; 3 . To consider and appraise changes or improvements in policies , procedures , or methods proposed by management or a member of the group ; 4 . To take action or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The extent to which a sincere effort is made to achieve the third and fourth objectives is normally a measure of the democracy of management within any organization . Leadership in discussions which involve group thinking is both different and more difficult than those which merely convey orders . Such conference leadership needs to be patterned along the lines suggested in Chapters IV and V. For a true consultative conference more time should be reserved and a more precise discussion pattern prepared in advance . The presiding officer must also distinguish carefully between those matters which can be easily transacted and a decision announced , and others on which there may be a valid difference of opinion and , if action is too hasty , possible dissatisfaction . The conference of this type , therefore has a dual function : ( i ) to afford subordinates an opportunity to participate in molding policies and procedures and ( 2 ) for management to convey its final decision , preferably a conclusion which is based upon joint agreement .  | The extent of group participation will depend on how much advice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority of the group with reference to the subject matter . If an order is merely transmitted from top management , group discussion may be restricted to interpreting its meaning and application in order that execution may be thorough and uniforin . On the other hand , if a proposed program or regulation is submitted for consideration , more time may be spent in deciding whether the proposal shall be ratified , disapproved , or modified . Topics submitted by top management for consideration may include , for example , suggested changes in organization structure , a reallocation of manufacturing , sales , or transport facilities , a change in personnel policy , any of which may involve a discussion and recommendation by the group . In considering such matter as budgets or manpower targets or investigation of a particular operation , group action may also involve the mapping of a definite plan of action . At lower operating levels , staff meetings are more particularly concerned with problems of standard procedures . Management may ask for information regarding the performance of new tools or equipment . A simplification of filing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or there may be problems of transferring controls of expanding production volume from one echelon to another . In such situations , the discussion can profitably follow the lines of the pattern suggested for JMT and JRT training for supervisors . The Importance of Participation in Management An organization does not function effectively when the individuals comprising it function in separate cells . Each needs to know what is going on : how his work is affected by the activities of his fellow workers and in turn , how his own efforts influence the ultimate objectives of the organization . Successful business enterprise involves close cooperation and action . Coordination and mutual understanding are particularly important under the changing conditions existing in the world today . These two factors spell harmony in any organization ? and harmony is the basis of morale . Properly conducted conferences can be used with surprising success in developing morale and engendering a feeling of genuine participation in management . A dictatorial " one-man " form of organization makes for routineers who say : " I 'm not paid to think ; I just do what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not my concern ; After all , I 'm not the boss ? he never does anything I suggest anyway . " On the other hand , a more democratic organization recognizes the contribution of each individual . In such an environment improvement results from constructive multiple thinking ; it is readily possible to mend administrative practice . Genuine participation is possible only when the leader of any work group ( a social as well as an economic unit ) is convinced that con-
