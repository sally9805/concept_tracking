Blasphemy was uttered last week : Maestro Arturo Toscanini was criticized out loud . Beaky , bespectacled Sigmund Spaeth , " Tune Detective , " barbershop balladeer and general musical quidnunc , told a Los Angeles convention of the National Federation of Music Clubs : <P> " Much as I respect Toscanini as a musical genius , I am forced to regard him as a menace to American music . In preference to making some honest effort to discover first-rate American music , he plays the puerilities of tenth-rate Italian composers . He has been glorified until the public thinks no other symphonic conductor is worth listening to . "
