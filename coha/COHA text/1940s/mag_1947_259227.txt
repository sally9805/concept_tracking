The fear that " Lippy " Durocher had been rendered speechless by love began to haunt deepest Brooklyn . Out in California , 3,000 miles away , the man with the built-in snarl had been turning away reporters ' questions with a soft " No comment ! " To Mother Brooklyn , that attitude became Durocher like a hole in the head . <P> Dodger fans understood that Leo had been frustrated almost to distraction in his attempts to marry Movie Star Laraine Day . First , he had to wait for the California courts to grant her a divorce from her first husband ( who had as good as called Leo a snake in the grass ) . When Miss Day 's interlocutory decree came through last week , it was with the usual California stipulation that she would have to wait a year before remarrying . <P> Nobody in Flatbush blamed Leo and Laraine for flying to Juarez , Mexico , to get her a second divorce with no strings attached , or for driving back to El Paso to be married . But Los Angeles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Day 's first divorce plea , had a big objection . Together , the judge and the Durochers fought through the jungle of U.S. divorce laws . <P> The Taffy Look . Judge Dockweiler said very bluntly that if Leo tried to live with Miss Day in California she would be charged with bigamy . He also said that Miss Day would have to show cause why her interlocutory decree should not be set aside for having been obtained in bad faith . " Movie actresses , " he added with some irrelevancy , " must serve as an example to young people . " <P> <P> Miss Day , who is 26 , Mormon-bred , and does not smoke or drink , had an appropriate answer for that one . " Judge , why do you crucify me ? " she asked . " Do n't you want me to be happy ? " The judge looked stern . " We did it on the spur of the moment , " seconded 39-year-old Leo , hopefully . But Judge Dockweiler , apparently , had never seen the Dodgers play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Leo moved into a hotel , Laraine began work on a new picture for RKO . Leo followed her to the set . Between takes , they played gin rummy or held hands . When she was called to the camera , the look between Laraine and Leo stretched like buttered taffy . " I 'll be waiting , sweetheart , " said Leo , somewhat in the manner of a wife seeing her husband off to jail . <P> Brooklyn was baffled-all except Manager Mack Shapiro of the Berkshire Theater . He confidently put up new lettering on his marquee : GARY GRANT AND MRS . LEO DUROCHER IN MR . LUCKY . The other half of the double bill : THEY KNEW WHAT <P> THEY WANTED .
