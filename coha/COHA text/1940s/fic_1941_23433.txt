COMEDY ON THE PLAINS A STORY BY PAUL HORGAN L n Mr. Binney said he was sitting on the front porch of the hotel , looking at the mud puddle between the two cottonwood trees across the street , when the troop of cavalry from Fort Stanton rode round the corner of Jaffa-Prager 's store under the command of Lieutenant Pyne . He said this was in 1882 . Said there were those three lieutenants at Fort Stanton in the Sierra Capitan , Pyne , Paddock , and Pershing , and he said they used to call them the Three Green P 's . Pyne was the youngest and the greenest . Evidently the first thing West Point did with a graduate was send him to New Mexico to learn things suddenly . Pyne rode up to the hotel porch and said good-afternoon to Clyde Binncy , who answered him from his tipped chair , with a kindly feeling toward the young officer , who was older than he was himself , at that . Pyne was a long-legged boy on that mare which was red 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His hair was a brush of scorched yellow when he took off his flop-brimmed campaign hat . Summer was in , right . Binney liked his looks because Pyne was feeling foolish about something and not trying to hide it by being grand , the way some of those young officers usually did , feeling of their new mustaches . " Are you Clyde Binney ? " " Uh-huh ! " " I thought so . My name 's Pyne . I 've got this troop of cavalry here . " " I see you have . " " That was a silly thing for me to say . But I wonder if you can help me . " " Very likely . " " Have you seen any Indians going by here ? " " Not since last week . " " No Mescaleros ? " " Not a single one . . . . You lose some ? " " No , but I got to find some quick or I 'm set to be court-martialed . " " You do n't say . " " Man at Picacho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could get you to help . " Mr. Binney told Pyne that was n't very difficult , just ask him . " All right , here 's what . " Pync said he had been ordered to take this troop on a reconnaissance march from Fort Stanton , through Picacho , up Picacho Hill , and over the plains to Bosque Grande , keeping careful log of his movements , and observing any extraordinary conditions on the range . They were new troops and needed seasoning , and he was out to season them . " Being an old-timer of course , " said Binney . " No , not really of course , " answered Pyne with sober humility that made Binney feel a little ashamed . Anyway , when Pyne got to Picacho Mr. Casey had stopped him on the road to tell about a band of Mescalero Apaches who had come through on a horse raid , driven off eight head , and headed down the plain toward Roswell . There were about forty or forty-five of them . Some of them were drunk . All of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses were in from grazing on the long-grassed hills . Sixty years ago , Mr. Binney said , the hills were covered with grass as long as your waist . There were n't any goats then and few cows . So Lieutenant Pyne got ambitious and decided to chase the Indians , bring them back , and report to his commanding officer Major Daly at Fort Stanton that he had apprehended and returned to their reservation a band of renegade and dangerous Indians . But he added that Mr. Binney could see how he must succeed in this purely personal undertaking or face court-martial for presuming to disobey orders . The Major was that type , he said . So it seemed to be time for Binney to get over his nonsense and see what could be done . He was twenty-two then , and had grown up on the West Texas plains where his father was a cowboy . He 'd slept in a house fewer times than otherwise . It just so happened therefore that he knew with his bones in a sort of inner memory the things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , was going to have to learn because the Army said so . " If you could help me scout after those Mescaleros ? " proposed Pyne . " I believe I could . Get on down from your mare and we 'll make some plans . " The troop dismounted at Pyne 's command . They were fresh-looking soldiers , most of them clean-shaven , and their creased blue flannel shirts and dusty breeches with the broad yellow stripes down the side seams were well cut and thick filled . They had heavy sabers strapped to their saddles and short carbines reversed in leather scabbards . They had a foreign look to Binney , in the sun-filled single street of the town of Roswell in 1882 ; but you take a boy and rub enough dirt of one kind and another into him , right off the face of the earth , and ' fis n't long before you 've got a man , a soldier . Mr. Binney said he could smile all he liked over the Three Green P 's , but all of them came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t was some time later . Sixty years ago Roswell was a sight , Mr. Binney was fond of remembering , with an old wit 's scandalous complacency . Nine houses and that puddle between the two cottonwood trees after every time it rained . There were two wells in the place , a blacksmith shop  --  the first thing you heard riding toward Roswell from any of the plains directions was old Donohoe 's anvil , a stinging music that came to represent home in a very short while . There was Captain Lea 's adobe house and the store seventy-five feet south of it . The road to Lincoln and Fort Stanton straggled west from Captain Lea 's front yard . Eastward lay the Pecos River , you could see the pink-and-blue bluffs from the edge of the porch of this hotel if you leaned out and looked . It was an Indian neighborhood , all right . The high sierras to the west were full of them . They went on seasonal sprees like the small violent rivers which flooded a few weeks every year , tearing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountain valleys , cutting the plains like a cake knife . On the highest hills of the valley during such Indian tempers the Mexican ranchers posted sentinels who watched the Indians come and gave warning to the rancherias in the path of rumpus . Roswell had two little rivers then , much regular water . Willows grew by springs , and cattle trails got the habit of intersecting there . Mr. Binney remarked that it took sixty years to do it ; but they made something out of the town with nine houses , a mud puddle , and an Indian scare now and then . He added that Mr. Pyne and his kind helped too of course . No need to belittle . The point was that everybody in that little green spot between high mountains far to the west , and plains to the north and south , and the Pecos River below the Llano Estacado to the east , a wilderness of space  --  everybody had to help everybody else in those days . He said for Lieutenant Pyne to take his brand new billy-boys out aways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going at two o'clock in the morning , not the whole troop , just the Lieutenant and two good men , and Clyde Binney would join them . They would need good horses because the pursuit might take a little time . There was only one way for the Apaches to go and that was east , over the Pecos and up Comanche Draw ; because once they got on the Staked Plains they could spread out and , so far 's Mr. Casey 's horses were concerned , never be heard of again . " We 've got to catch them , " repeated Mr. Pyne , and his Eastern brogue was just sort of pitiful to Mr. Binney , it sounded so honest when the man was in trouble . " I 'll meet you at two o'clock , " said Binney . " You go on and camp now . " He watched the troop swing up and ride off at a slow trot . The light was falling golden and shallow on the little street and the deep puddle . It came in shafts through the cottonwoods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a youthful music from the leather , the sabers , the hooves , the whistling of the troopers riding at ease toward the willowy banks of North Spring River . Mr. Binney said he was n't so old but what he could recall the fine sight they made , but he could n't say , for he did n't rightly know it , but it was true , that the sight of soldiers in a troop turned his heart over . He said he was a wild-looking sort of a cuss then himself . His hair 'd been black and his face as dark as a pifion , but he had light-blue eyes . He always was skinny , but sufficient , sufficient . At one o'clock in the morning the stars were bright in their myriads . It was a July night , ever so fresh with gentle volumes of cool air off the south plains . Not a wind enough to make the cottonwoods talk softly . The stars made tiny pins of sparkle on the varnished green mirrors of cottonwood leaves . Mr. Binney said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corral opposite Captain Lea 's house  --  about where the Court House is now , he said  --  and fetch his horse , Dandy , leading him with a halter to the hotel where he 'd stored his saddle and bridle . He was readied up in nu time and turned to walk Dandy through the sleeping village toward North Spring River where the cavalry were encamped . He heard their horses first , munching the grass by the picket line and stomping lazily now and then . He could see by the starlight . He saw the sentry waiting to challenge him at the left of the path that led to the river . He dismounted a few yards off so 's not to wake up anybody . The soldiers were sleeping on the field , every which way . It was so warm most of them had n't even unrolled their packs . It looked in the starlight as much like a field after a battle as before one  --  those flung limbs and bellies bare to the sky . Mr. Binney thought there was a good chance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentry and dropped Dandy 's reins and stepped cagily through the sleepers looking for Pyne , who was by the river 's very edge . Pyne was sleeping deeply , which pleased Mr. Binney , since it meant the young man was n't unduly nervous about it all . But he woke up quickly , saying , " Yes , of course , " and got up and buttoned his shirt and his breeches , taking a deep breath , and remarking what a fine night it was . He went to call the two men he 'd picked for the trip , and sent them to saddle three horses . They all moved quietly , but they never could have kept the camp down . One by one , the men awoke . There was excitement up among them . They all wanted to go . They stretched and yawned and rubbed their fronts and were wide awake , and got the cook to make a huge pot of coffee . Firelight came up near the willows , and kindling cracked as if eager , and that 's how they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take along more men ? " Pyne asked . " Four 's enough if we catch them at all , " Mr. Binney replied . " A troop 'd mean a battle . We 're going to have to manage it some other way . . . . Hell , you never saw an Indian , did you ? " Pyne said no , not that way anyway . The soldiers had heard about a scout who was coming to he'p the Lieutenant , and it was n't anybody but that long ol ' kid from the hotel porch that afternoon . But listen how he talked to the Lieutenant , they marvelled , and decided that everything was about right if any of it was . The whole troop drank coffee and talked about what would happen if the Lieutenant and the others never came back , wait till Major Daly heard about this ; and the fire died down , the stars reigned again , some of the men talked through chattering teeth , not from cold but from excitement and vague desire , and the Lieutenant and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadows to the east on the near bank of North Spring River . Mr. Binney said it was about sunrise when they came to Comanche Draw . The Pecos bluff was facing them with cool blue shadow and the sun was coming up behind it . The sunlight was white . ft was going to be a scorcher . Ahead of them the river ran a shallow and narrow stream of red water in a wide bed of pale-red mud , dried in the shape of old floods . Here 's where they crossed , some-whereabouts , Mr. Binney said , and told Pyne with one soldier to look for tracks to the right , while he and the other boy went to the left . They rode down the bank aways and back , and found nothing , and met Pyne coming this way too . Pyne said they saw nothing like an Indian crossing . " Did you look there where the salt cedars are thick to the edge , and the water rakes by this bank , there , see where I mean ? " " Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side ? " ? No. ? " Let 's go . " They went to the place , and Mr. Binney led them through the brake of plumy cedar . He said it was clear 's your face , and showed the cavalry how the branches in the interior of the thicket were opcncd back , and how the bank where the water was deepest showed hardly any tracks , just a few freshly broken miniature cliffs of mud at the edge ; and how after they forded the red water the dried islands of mud on the other side were clear of hoof pocks ; but if they would notice , the river course came back to this other side now in a shallow curve , and here sure enough were little broken places leading out of the water itself up the bushy rise beyond . The Indians had simply forded the river , not across but with the stream , till it touched the far bank ; and then up and gone . Mr. Binney said Pyne was a noble young gentleman for one who was caught out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he 'd whup the youknow-what out of them if they ever so much 's breathed this story to the troop . But he knew they 'd tell , and they knew he would n't whup . It was just a way of everybody having the same joke without embarrassment . So they went on up the bluffs , through Comanche Draw . When they reached the top of the rise they were up the first of the three wide steps that led to the Staked Plains seventy miles eastward . The next step was twelve miles off ; it was called Mesa del Diablo . Between here and there were many sloping rises and falls ; but from a distance all looked flat . The four horsemen paused to stare at the early morning land . It was a fried and freckled sight . They looked back toward the village of Roswell and rested their eyes with the little courses of green trees that followed the streams back there . Mr. Binney said they did n't see anything at all when they set out again to the east for over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up faster than usual , though of course that was not really so . But he meant that it heated up in a hurry . By eight o'clock they were sweating . They kept their eyes squinted under their hat brims . Now the distance they could see was so great that in an odd way it made it hard to recognize what they looked at . A bush standing alone seemed for a long time to be an adobe hut , though they knew there were n't any dwellings out here . Then suddenly , when the distance was made back to man 's scale ; you might say , they saw that it was only a big bush boxed by shadow . So for a long time ( as that day went in the seemings of time ) they watched a funny sort of spot far ahead that seemed to be a ray of light hitting the horizon , as if from among little clouds . But overhead there were no clouds . The sky was sun-whitened blue , and it felt and looked like one of those concave-mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed to double the sun and make it brighter and hotter . Mr. Binney suddenly asked the Lieutenant what it was they were all staring at as they jogged on . " I think it is a mirage , " replied Mr. Pyne , with what sounded like plains craft . " It is a little tail of dust , that 's what it is On a still morning like this it 'll hang there for a long time nor seem to move . We 've found them . Now we 'll keep them in sight . " " Gallop around and catch them from the side ? " inquired Pyne . Mr. Binney said if they did that their horses would n't be any good for work when needed . He said they would take up a slow , cantering gait and just maintain it . Hold it easy . They 'd know fast enough when to come on in when the Indians sighted them . It would show . If the Indians disappeared off the face of the earth it meant they would be down in one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mesa del Diablo . The pursuit could catch up with them there . " How do you know ? " asked Mr. Pyne , with irritation caused by the heat of the day . " The cattle trail from the east on which I grew up from a boy is all to hell and gone over this prairie , Mr. Pyne . That 's how I know . And I know more than that . I know that if a drunken Indian gets sober he do n't know , like we do , that a hangover comes from what he drank . He thinks it is something talking to him inside and scolding him . He 'll try to kill it by killing someone else if he ai n't touched just right ; but if he is , then all you got to take care of is the son-of-agun 's honor . " " Honor ? " " Shoot ! Indian 's got lots of it . . . . You better canter , Mr. Pyne . " For Pyne 's red mare , Mr. Binney remembered , would n't keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was trotting angrily , perversely , trying to break the pace every few steps , and giving the young officer a local job to take care of when he was supposed to be trained on the horizon . Pyne 's new pants rippled and gathered up his leg . His gaiters rubbed and before the morning was over his skin was raw . Mr. Binney saw faint stains of blood seeping through the tailored cloth . The poor kid , he would think , but there was nothing to do or say about it ; and Pyne never lost his dignity as ranking officer of the expedition . Mr. Binney said he must 've been hellish uncomfortable . By mid-morning the heat was like something felt through glass . July was mostly this way , china-blue sky , white sun , brittle grass , and sandy dust . Anywhere they turned there was n't a scrap of shade even to look at , much less to get under . As he said , changes in the heatwavery distance just suddenly seemed to be even as you watched . Suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They 've seen us . " " Now let 's get at them , " said Pyne . Instead , Mr. Binney reined up . They all stopped . He said he believed the Indians were in the basins . Fifty feet from them , if you did n't look properly , you 'd miss them . It was very clever of them to disappcar so . The thing for us to do , Mr. Binney said , was go on riding right along as if nothing in the world was up but a pleasure jaunt , and not " see " a thing , not even a prairie dog , let alone forty-three Indians and eight extra horses , but just ride by , never having heard of any sink-holes around here ; and then when they were rightly opposite the first hole , wheel smartly , dismount , and cover the hole with their carbines . They could then do business . Of course there was a chance that he was wrong about all this , and the Indians might not be there or anywhere else ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out . Nothing was any different when they got there at last . Perfectly silent . Hot . Sunlight pouring down . Mr. Binney said they made the maneuver according to the ticket and were lying four besiders with their heads down and their eyes up . They stayed there like that for a full hour . Nothing . The sun went over an hour 's worth . That was all . Mr. Pyne finally looked at Mr. Binney with meaning . Binney said he was almost convinced , as Pyne was , that they were wooing an empty hope . But he held on , knowing that Indians used time the way animals did ; there was no hurry when something had to be done ; and when it was time to do nothing , why , all day was n't too long . So he held on , and sure enough , after a while he saw a little bush growing up over the edge of the sink-hole . He silently pointed to it , and Mr. Pyne 's mingled reassurance and dismay were something to see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew feathers , and had the rare property of being able to disappear below the miniature horizon . Now the silence grew alive and even seemed to be charged with a sort of comic speculation . It was clear then that both Indians and soldiers knew about each other . It was peculiar what a difference that made in how everything felt . They knew what they were after , and Mr. Binney told Mr. Pyne he was going forward alone , on the chance that a friendly parley might be managed . If it did n't work then the soldiers would know what to do well enough . He said he went right out then , walking at a crouch , but not especially trying to inch along on his belly . Right then , he declared , was when his hat did n't seem to want to stay on , and he heard the arrow whistle that took it off . He said he did n't know who was the more scared , himself or the Indian just over the lip of the sink-hole on whom he flung himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flying squirrel . He said he ended up like a got-durncd statue , with his foot actually on the Indian 's breast , and his Colt 's revolver covering the others in the basin . His heart was going rubadubdub , and he did n't dare turn . But Pyne and the two soldiers appeared behind him , to judge by their voices , and at that , Mr. Binney let his foot off the Indian and began to back up until he was with the others , and their guns had charge . " That 's them all right , is n't it , " said Pyne with excitement . The Indians were all in the basin . They were just simply pitiful , Mr. Binney remembered , like a whole flock of motheaten old hawks , not doing anything . Nobody said anything , they just looked at each other , the stolen horses were there in the middle , and the Indians ' own horses were scattered through the crowd . One of them was up in front near Mr. Binney . It had a rifle in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time in silence , during which nothing was really settled , lust two kinds of people facing each other , Mr. Binney went carefully down to the Indian horse and made motions to indicate that he was going to begin disarming the whole party , under cover of the guns of the United States Cavalry standing on the rim of the sink-hole . Everybody watched him , the Indians in breathless quiet . He grasped the wooden stock of the rifle with a symbolical flourish , and gave it a yank , Mr. Binney said the stock came away in his hand , and that 's all there was to it . No barrel . Just a old butt , nothing else . The beaded and fringed scabbard was a hollow mockery , he said . You never know what will save the day , he said . As it turned out he did the very thing , and began to laugh at how he 'd been fooled . He threw the old rifle butt into the air and laughed fit to be tied , and the Indians began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hawks on a fence post , and clawed one another , and pointed , and flapped their elbows hilariously like plucked wings . Laughing till he cried , Mr. Binney went through the crowd and got all their guns . They only had five . But he took their arrows too , about a dozen , from the care of two young men . Under the cover of high comedy on the plains , he disarmed the horde , and because they were laughing merrily , their honor did not seem in any way touched . If the whole thing was a joke , nobody minded surrendering . But getting them to give up , and come on and climb out of the sink-hole was the hardest part of the whole struggle . He said it took the best part of the afternoon . They had all the horses tied one to another on lariat leads , and the guns emptied and strapped to the soldiers ' saddles . The laughing could n't go on forever . Lieutenant Pyne was relieved as a boy at making this capture . Mr. Binney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from going down and nudging the Indians up top with the nozzle of his revolver , which would 've made real trouble . But one by one the Indians came on up . They all had little devices to keep their dignity . One of them would come up laughing as if he had just thought of going back to town . Another would come a-daintyin ' , said Mr. Binney , as if thinking about something else . And another 's solemn 's a judge , frowning while he came along . The next one would be picking at his hair , as if " Would these things never get all picked out , " and so on , and so on . The Indian coming up had to be finished and done , and standing among the guarded captives before the next one down there , whichever he was , would consider moving . No two ever started at once . They must have had some signal . Without exception , they all enacted the fiction of leaving under their own perfectly free will . So much honor took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the expedition was ready to move back to make the reputation of one of the Three Green P 's . Mr. Binney said they marched as long as they had daylight and then they camped , keeping two on guard all night in alternate details . At dawn they started again , and now nobody would look at anybody else , among the Mescaleros . A soldier led the way , another one and Mr. Binney flanked the party , and at the rear , a conqueror , safely returning to what might otherwise have been court-martial , was Lieutenant Pync . They walked their horses for better control of the Indian band . They got in late that afternoon , and from there on , with the whole cavalry troop to mount guard , the rest of it was easy . The next morning the troop started west toward the mountains . But before they went , Lieutenant Pyne came by the Hotel to see Clyde Binney , who was now of no further use to the expedition . Mr. Pyne had a flat japanned tin box fitted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Binney that he was very grateful indeed for what he had done , and Mr. Binney knew what it had meant to him personally in his professional career . Said this was troop money in this black japanned box with the gold lines painted on it , and he was pleased now to hand Mr. Binney fifty dollars , the pay for scout services to the United States Government being twenty-five dollars a day . Mr. Binney said that was one thing he had not known before . He shook hands with Mr. Pyne , and said if he 'd knowed it it would 've been hard just to say how long it'd 've taken at that rate to catch up with those sobered and sorry Indians .
