txt The theory of " continental isolation , " to which so many Americans still cling , receives another jolt in the news that Douglas Aircraft Company has completed the first of its B-19 bombers . Here is the most formidable agency of destruction yet developed : a great fortress built to fly 7,750 miles nonstop ? to Europe and return  --  with a cargo of eighteen tons of bombs . It is visible proof that the day is rapidly approaching when no nation and no part of any nation will be immune from direct attack from any part of the world . This whole question of the impact of modern air power on the traditional conceptions of continental defense is analyzed in an important article by Major Alexander P. de Seversky in the new issue of The American Mercury . Comparisons are invidious , but sometimes necessary . It must be noted that Major de Seversky speaks with more authority in these matters than Colonel Lindbergh , since he is not only a pilot but a designer of aircraft , not only an inventor of bomb sights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized authority on the tactics and strategy of aerial warfare . It is Major de Seversky 's central thesis  --  and the new B-19 bomber comes along to illustrate his point ? that " isolationism " is ruled out physically by the advent of air power and the tremendous speed with which its range is being widened . To show that a European enemy of the United States could not land armies and occupy this country mile by mile proves little . The same enemy , if it succeeds in wresting control of the skies overhead , can pound the country into helpless wreckage without the need to occupy territory . " Should it be argued that ultimate victory could not be achieved by that alone ( though I believe it could ) , the fact still remains that this is a type of destructive fury to which no nation will wish to expose itself . " Moreover , by a curious truth which is not yet widely understood , the more industrialized a country is , the more vulnerable it is to destruction from overhead . " American industries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , make ideal targets for air attacks . The tremendous expanse of our country may give us a feeling of hugeness , but the vital centers are few and extremely exposed . " There is no real security for those centers in old-fashioned " isolation " behind " impregnable " ramparts . Air power is " a threat in which oceans have already lost some of their protective value and are destined to become soon as illusory a defense as the Maginot Line " itself . If there is a warning here for those who would have us risk standing alone , without effective allies in a new world of terrible danger , putting our whole faith in the geography of our position , there is also assurance for those of us who favor , instead of isolation , a policy of " all-out " aid to Britain . For if a preponderance of air power in Hitler 's hands is a threat to our security , a preponderance of air power in the hands of our friends can be used as effectively against Hitler . Major de Seversky does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this war , even with Amerlean assistance . He believes , on the contrary , not merely that Britain has a chance of winning , " but that , given the full material backing of the United States , she has only a minor chance of not winning . " In the race to achieve the vital factor of definitive air superiority , Germany , even with all her continental appendages , " will be more and more plagued by shortages of critical materials , " and more and more handicapped by increasingly undernourished labor working sullenly under coercion , while " the Anglo-American bloc , its production centers widely scattered over the world , will have access to all materials ; it will operate in many regions under relatively peaceful conditions , with labor that is voluntary and well-fed . " In this tug-of-war of production , " equality in air power for the Anglo-American bloc is already within sight , and rapid establishment of supremacy seems in the cards . * * * Once we admit the possibility of superior Anglo-American air power , we must also admit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Here is one answer to the question , How will the war be won ? and fresh courage for faint hearts .
