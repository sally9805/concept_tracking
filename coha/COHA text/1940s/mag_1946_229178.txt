Outside Rome 's Viminale Palace ( seat of the Government ) a huge crowd of paper-hatted , overalled workers and homeless war veterans shivered patiently in the first chill of approaching winter . Inside , spokesmen sought to air their grievance : 30,000 laborers had been discharged that morning from public-works projects . <P> But the Government would not listen . The crowd 's patience changed , to sullenness , to anger ; shouts became a frenzied roar . Socialist Vice Premier Pietro Nenni tried to mollify them . Later , a shirtless young man in blue overalls said : <P> " I was among those who lifted him up and carried him on our shoulders so that he could speak to the crowd . Suddenly the cavalry charged . . . then a flying squad came in . They beat everyone , including Nenni , who with his hands held up to protect his eyeglasses , kept shouting " I am Nenni , I am Nenni ! ' " <P> The infuriated demonstrators quickly counterattacked with sticks and stones . They swarmed through the palace , splintering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Premier Alcide de Gasperi 's office . Three hours later , they finally drifted off . Behind them they left two dead and 141 injured in Rome 's worst riot since the angry days which had spawned Mussolini 's regime . <P> What was the trouble ? Said one worker : " There is urgent work to do : anyone can see there are no houses ; the water supply has broken down ; land needs reclaiming ; we must have sanitation . And we are building a road that is parallel to another . " Explained another : " . . . They make us do useless work , then sack us because it is useless . " <P> Who had started the riot ? Preliminary investigations pointed to agents provocateurs in the crowd . Communists blamed " monarchists and Fascists . " Rightists blamed Communists . Said white-haired Police Chief Luigi Ferrari : " God alone knows . " <P> At week 's end a placatory 35% wage increase had been granted ; the works projects continued . To bolster Premier de Gasperi 's Government 's sagging morale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reimburse the Italians for lire lent to the U.S. Army .
