txt Establishment at an early date of an Eastern Military Area along the entire Eastern seaboard , with the Army taking immediate control over dimming of shore lights ' and regulation ' of enemy aliens , was announced here yesterday by Lieut . Gen. Hugh A. Drum , commanding general of the Eastern Defense Command and First Army . The order , described as " an important and necessary adjunct to the defense of our Eastern seaboard , " will set up the machinery for complete and effective Army control over any threats to " the national defense and security . " When put into effect completely , it will set up in sixteen Eastern States , from Maine to Florida , and the District of Columbia , a military area similar to that created by the Western Defense Command on the Pacific coast , where 112,000 Japanese are being evacuated to inland points . General Drum 's statement , however , made it clear that no " mass evacuation " is being contemplated on the Eastern seaboard , and that " regulation or control of conduct is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No Longer The order also means , in effect , that , as far as the Army is concerned , the honeymoon of waiting for completely satisfactory voluntary cooperation by civilian authorities and localities in regard to dimming out shore lights is at an end . From now on , shore lights , which are an aid to enemy submarines in picking off shipping along the Atlantic coast , will be dimmed out or else the Army will take steps to enforce its orders . As a token of the Army 's intentions on the shore light problem General Drum 's announcement was followed immediately by . a statement from Major Gen. Irving J. Phillipson , commanding general of the Second Corps Area , who will be in charge of enforcement in New York , New Jersey and Delaware . General Phillipson observed I that , through cooperation of State and local authorities , an " effective dimming " of shore lighting , " with certain exceptions , " already had been accomplished . The Army soon will make public " more comprehensive regulations " and " it is hoped " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoided , he said . However , he warned , if the new regulations prove ineffective " complete blackouts may be necessary . " In New York City Mayor La Guardia took notice of the new Army order when he acknowledged that General Drum will be in " supreme command , " and expressed the hope that shore localities will cooperate in dimming lights in or , der to avoid " very drastic penalties . " To Control Enemy Sympathizers General Drum emphasized in nis order that the new plan will not interfere at all " with the lives of the great mass of loyal Americans , " but he warned that it is " the determination of the military authorities " to stop any enemy sympathizer , whether alien or " disloyal American , " from doing anything that might harm the United States . The Federal Bureau of Investigation and other Federal agencies will assist in execution of the military orders . he said . The following States will be included in the Eastern Military Area : Maine , Vermont , New Hampshire , Massachusetts , Connecticut , Rhode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvania , Virginia , Maryland ( also the District of Columbia ) , North Carolina , South Carolina , Georgia and all of Florida east of the Apalachicola River . This takes in most of Florida , as the Apalachicola River is near the extreme western boundary of the State , about parallel with the Alabama State line . General Drum , whose'headquarters are at Governors Island , will b- in command of the entire military area . Control of the area will be carried out under him by the commanding generals of the four existing corps areas in the territory . In this corps area General Phillipson , whose headquarters also is at Governors Island , will be in charge . The other commanders are : Major Gen. Sherman Miles , commanding general , First Corps Area , with headquarters at Boston . His territory takes in all the New England States . Major Gen. Milton A. Reckord , commanding general , Third Corps Area , with headquarters at Baltimore . His territory in Pennsylvania , Virginia , Maryland and the District of Columbia . Major Gen. J. P. Smith% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlanta . His area includes North and South Carolina , Georgia , Florida , Alabama and Tennessee , but Alabama , Tennessee and the part of Florida west of the Appalachicola are not included in the Eastern Military Area . General Drum 's statement gave no indication how soon the complete plan would be in operation , stating only in a prefatory note that the Eastern Military Area would be established " at an early date . " It explained that the area was being set up under a Presidential executive order of Feb. 19 , 1942 , empowering military commanders designated by the Secretary of War to take such steps " whenever the designated commander deems such action necessary or desirable . " " The object of prescribing a military area is to facilitate control so as to prevent subversive activities and aid being given the enemy , such as by lighting along our coasts , " the general 's statement said . Control is to be decentralized within the various corps areas and " will be maintained primarily by means of a system of definitely described zones , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be requested to assist . " A zone , generally , will embrace a public utility , a military , naval or civil installation , a commercial or defense facility , a territorial region , a strip of coastline or waterfront or any other strategic point . Mass Evacuations Not Planned Emphasizing that regulation and control of conduct and movements of enemy aliens and any other persons suspected of subversive activities , rather than wholesale evacuations , was the plan , the statement said : " The fundamental policy embodied in the plan is not to interfere in any manner whatever with the lives of the great mass of loyal Americans in the States included in the military area , or with the economic life of the area , but it does express the determination of the military authorities to prevent any enemy sympathizer , whether alien enemy , alien of other nationality or disloyal American , if any exist , from committing any act detrimental to the national security . Those persons whose conduct reflects their patriotic motives will not be affected by this administration . " Enforcement will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include " exclusion from the area , internment of aliens , prosecutions * * * and evacuations . " While " mass evacuation is not contemplated , " there may be evacuations " by selective processes applicable to enemy aliens or to any other persons deemed dangerous to remain at large within the area or within its zones . " Indicating the Army 's concern over the shore lighting problem , the statement declared : " As an initial step in the enforcement of the restrictions to be prescribed for the military area , the four corps area commanders * have been directed forthwith to assume control over all lighting on the seacoast so as to prevent the silhouetting of ships and their consequent destruction by enemy submarines . " All State Governors and civil officials concerned have been requested to assist the , corps area commanders in enforcing the necessary restrictions , General Drum 's statement concluded . Major Gen. Phillipson 's statement was as follows : " Through the assistance of Governors and local authorities along the East coast of the States of the Second Corps Area , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptions , already been accomplished . This dimming out has been done voluntarily after the necessity therefor had been determined by appropriate Federal authorities . " In view of the ineffectiveness at certain points , more comprehensive regulations will be issued and furnished for the press for immediate publication . Nightly inspections for the effectiveness of the dimming will be continued . " It is hoped that the measures contemplated will obviate the necessity for enforced blackouts . However , complete blackouts may be necessary in localities which fail to meet the prescribed requirements through the dimming proposed . " Mayor La Guardia said in his weekly broadcast yesterday that General Drum had called his attention " again " to the necessity of an effective dimming out of shore lights . The Mayor , who has been appealing to localities for effective cooperation , said that considerable progress had been made , but that it now will be necessary for residents and business places along the coast to see that windows , store lights and advertising signs facing the sea are dimmed . " It is not difficult to adjust family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and let us pray to God that we will not be required to take more extreme action by reason of enemy activity . " The Mayor said there was no reason why homes or stores should be " darkened , " but that it was " necessary " that " no light reflects toward the sea . " He said he hoped it never would become necessary " to invoke the very drastic penalties " that General Drum could order " if there is lack of cooperation or willful refusal to comply . " The Mayor said he had appointed a board to see that all orders given by military authorities concerning lights are carried out . The board includes Arthur Wallander , Chief of Staff of Defense Activities ; Park Commissioner Robert Moses , Patrick ? Quilty , Commissioner of the Department of Water Supply , Gas and Electricity , and the Borough President of whatever borough may be involved . The Associated Press reported that the First Corps Area , with headquarters in Boston , also had taken immediate steps toward ordering an effective dimming out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New England States take immediate action and emphasized that radical steps were necessary because the lighting situation was " so immediately vital .
