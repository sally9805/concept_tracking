When Winston Churchill in 1940 promised the British people " nothing but blood , toil , tears and sweat , " he was as much the voice of Britain as was the roar of Spitfires over the chalk cliffs of Dover . Last fortnight , when he offered the world a British way toward peace with security ( TIME , March 29 ) , he voiced the yearnings not only of his own countrymen but of all the Allied peoples . Among them were many differences , some deep and wide ; but common to them all was a desire to see at least the outlines of a better world . <P> Winston Churchill 's achievement was that he , alone among the leading Allied statesmen , had given the Allied peoples something that they could grasp , examine , discuss in tangible terms . Out of this discussion , by week 's end , had come a good deal of light on the world that people want-and on the world that they are likely to have . <P> The Home Base . The Prime Minister had soared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsive chord in the mass heart of Britain . Most Britons reacted sentimentally ; few stopped to analyze the things that Churchill did not say . But , in the British press , the few dissents were to the point . Said the Manchester Guardian : " The four-year plan for domestic economy after the war does not amount to more than what the Government is already pledged to in the way of reconstruction . " Growled the London News Chronicle : " There was not one reference to the Atlantic Charter , nothing about the future of national sovereignties , hardly a word about colonial administration . " <P> Politically , the speech was one of the Prime Minister 's most astute maneuvers . It solidified Tory support behind him , and it may well split Liberals and Labor . Before the speech there had been many signs that Britain was swinging leftward . If this trend was really fundamental , no one speech-however great-could permanently halt it . But , after the speech , Winston Churchill 's domestic intentions were clear : he proposed to drive the Tory chariot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , postwar government , dragging Liberal and Labor defectives willy-nilly . Whether , now 68 , he hoped to retain his personal ascendancy after the war was beside the point ( he had said : " I have no personal ambitions " ) . But that Winston Churchill , the world statesman , was cannily bolstering his political base at home was a fact of world importance .
