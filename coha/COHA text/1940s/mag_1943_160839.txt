While Argentina 's Ramirez Government went its lone unneighborly way , the Argentine 's longtime Ambassador to the U.S. , suave Don Felipe Alberto Espil , remained a Good Neighbor . He and his Chicago-raised Seora had made the red-carpeted Argentine Embassy a model of diplomacy . Last week Buenos Aires called them home . <P> Seor . Ambassador Espil , 56 , is sometimes called the " Mona Lisa of the Pam pas " for his thought-concealing smile . He first came to the U.S. in 1919 as first secretary to the Embassy , London-tailored , expert at the tango , an escort of Wallis Spencer years before she became the Duchess of Windsor . But Don Felipe was no mere tailor 's dummy . He studied the U.S. and its economics . By 1931 he had become Ambassador , and in the next twelve years operated smoothly on friction-fraught issues . <P> Seora . Don Felipe also spent 14 of his years in the U.S. waiting for the hand of Courtney Letts , a tall , dark-haired , slender member of Chicago 's onetime " Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in the ' 20s , but she married two wealthy Americans first . Finally , three weeks after her second divorce , Courtney Letts Stillwell Borden became Senora de Espil , who in turn became one of the world 's ten best-dressed women , and an able diplomat herself . <P> Her previous marriages handicapped her in the salons of Buenos Aires ' Roman Catholic society . But she learned Spanish , became a Catholic , and took such an interest in Argentine history that she now writes articles on the subject . <P> Substitute . The Ramirez Government will replace Seor Espil with Adrian Escobar , a stranger to the U.S. , but well-known as an opportunist . Once considered pro-Franco , Escobar is at least certain to be safely pro-Ramirez.
