ON December 3 , in Geneva , a subcommittee of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights rejected , by a vote of eleven to one , a Russian proposal to investigate the Negro problem in the United States . So ended the first act of a drama which must some day be played through to the end . The action began in October in New York , when certain Negro citizens of the United States wrote a letter to the world telling the bloody story of race relations in this country and asked the United Nations for action . Entitled " A Statement-on the Denial of Human Rights to Minorities in the Case of Citizens of Negro Descent in the United States of America and an Appeal to the United Nations for Redress , " the mimeographed. volume of 150 pages was prepared by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and presented to the Social and Economic Council . Each of the fifty-seven delegations to the U. N. was given a copy and requested to consider ... the plight of Negroes in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is partly an indictment of the government of the United States by a large section of its citizens . Government has failed the Negro at every level , from the local sheriff to the Supreme Court . Most especially the Supreme Court , though on its dignified home is boldly emblazoned " Equal Justice Under the Law , " is found in this record to have been the great diluter of Negro rights , the great negatof of constitutional guaranties . From Revolutionary days . the Supreme Court has taken the attitude that the " Negro has no rights which the white man is bound to respect , " a dictum incorporated in Roger Taney 's justly infamous Drell Scott d'cision . The constitutional amendments which followed the Civil War were designed to abolish slavery and make the Negro a citizen and a voter , but they were soon interpreted in such a way that , instead of serving to protect the newly emancipated slave in the exercise of his citizenship , they helped the states to constrict , limit , and even prohibit the rights he had been granted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has permitted Negroes to be deprived of the right to vote : from its decisions stem the poll taxes , separate primaries , " rotten boroughs , " and other voting restrictions which are still in wide use throughout the South . The right of Negroes to sit on juries when Negroes are being tried has been nullified on the simple theory that the proof of discrimination presented to the august court was not satisfactory . Separation of races in intra-state travel has been encouraged by the court 's verdict that this was but a " valid exercise of the police power of the state . " , Jeceraper 13 , 1947 The Supreme Court has denied the .. Negro his civil rights on the ground that Congress was given no power under the Fourteenth Amendment to regulate the acts of private individuals in the states  --  this from the same institution which held that the language of the Fourteenth Amendment , " Nor shall any state deprive any person of life , liberty , or property without due process of law , " protected corporations . The corporations have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coddled into monstrous growth by decisions which have made the famous Fourteenth Amendment their most valuable legal aid . Monopoly has won  --  and the Negro has lost  --  as a result of the interpretation of a constitutional amendment intended to emancipate the slaves . Piling indignity on injury , it was the Supreme Court which invented-the theory of " separate but equal " facilities . Acceptance of this vicious theory was of course the certain guaranty , not of equality , but of its opposite , segregation , and out of it have come the separate school systems , separate toilet facilities , separate quarters in hospitals , trains , and practically everyWhere else , including graveyards . On every hand the South offers proof that these separate facilities are unequal and are the cause of much of the disease , ignorance , and poverty of the Negro . And this proof of the responsibility of our highest court provides final refutation of the often repeated allegation that the basic reason for the discrimination suffered by the Negro is the prejudice and ignorance of our lowest government officials  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company-town mayor . These share the guilt  --  incident after incident cited in the N. A. A. C. P. volume demonstrates their complicity ? . but the shocking truth is that their basest acts have been sparked and encouraged by the Supreme Court . After recounting the evils for which the government must be blamed , the statement describes the intimidation practiced by ordinary non-office-holding white men who in defiance of the law have beaten and shot and lynched Negroes without interference . The records , accurate only since 1832 , show that thousands of Negro men , women , and children have been burned , hung , or flogged to death by'mobs . And not one white person has ever been convicted for participating in this mass murder . In fact , until last year not one was ever arrested for the crime . The U. N. delegate who read this document must have found a clear parallel with Nazi S. S. methods , particularly as the story goes on to reveal how Negroes are beaten up every day in Northern as well as Southern cities , often by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted that the press rarely bothers to report them . Every sector of white America is implicated . Labor 's record is cited : twenty-one Negroes wounded or  --  killed because they refused to give up to whites their jobs is firemen on railroads . The N. A. A. C. P. has already been criticized by 645 Southern newspapers for " washing - all this dirty linen in public . " And there will be cries that this is ammunition for Russian propaganda against American democracy . But the United States has evaded the problem for so long that Negroes here are looking beyond it to the world . The statement presented to the United Nations was the effort of a people to document the indignities to which they have been subjected . Its legal phrases conceal a smoldering anger which , fanned by another " Uncle Tom 's Cabin , " might sweep the world . The framers of the appeal have not shrunk from its implications . They speak of themselves as forming a nation within a nation . " We number as many as the inhabitants of the Argentine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Norway , and Denmark . . . . We are a group which has the right to be heard ; and while we rejoice that other smaller nations can stand and make their wants known in the United Nations , we maintain equally that our voice should not be suppressed or ignored . " W ITH this challenge the Negroes of the United States begin their march as a group , demanding their rights in the council of the nations . Their new course is a long step away from the usual N. A. A. C. P. policy , which has believed that enlisting the aid of influential whites was the key to the advancement of the Negro . It is a return to other historical methods , to those of the Reconstruction era , when Negroes acting as solid communal groups resisted the attacks of the Ku Klux Klan . The present challenge is presented by a militant and united people , conscious of their aims and unafraid , for perhaps the first time , of stirring up a red scare . Dr. W. E. Buighardt DuBois , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bogy : " It is not Russia that threatens the United States so much as Mississippi , not Stalin and Molotov but Bilbo and Rankin ; internal injustice done to one 's brothers is far more dangerous than the aggression of strangers from abroad . " Whatever the Russians make of this , and by espousing the Negro cause at Geneva they indicated it would be a great deal , action will be up to us . We must cure ourselves of our Rankins . The friendship of the dark peoples of the world is at stake . And whoever wins them will win the world . The N. A. A. C. P. plans to publish the statement in five languages , and as its news spreads , our government , unless it moves forward at an unprecedented pace , will find itself convicted of talking democracy to peoples in Asia and Africa while condoning a police state against their brothers within our borders . Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt , one of our delegates to Geneva , is on the board of directors of the N. A. A. C. P. Since she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had to subordinate her well-known personal feelings to this country 's historical anti-Negro poi-icy . Her dilemma is not new . It has frustrated many of our able political leaders . It is perhaps responsible for our American proclivity for delivering moral lectures to other countries . Much of our ranting about the imperialism and callousness of other countries may be the expression of a subconscious sense of guilt-growing out of the ever-present disabilities of the Negro . By our words on the international scene we have tried to compensate for our deeds at home . T HE shadow of this indictment hangs over the United Nations as well as the United States . For the yardstick by which the world 's oppressed peoples will judge the United Nations is the fervor with which it will defend the dignity of man . If the U. N. does not eventually give this petition a place on its agenda , it will be apparent that there is no organ in the world to which oppressed people can turn for an ultimate redress of their grievances . The American delegation , for obvious reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States difficult to deal with . Other delegations may face equal difficulty for other reasons . Interference in the affairs of another country could be charged , and though there are precedents for this in the resolutions against Franco 's dictatorship in Spain and the treatment of Indians in the Union of South Africa , so far no case has involved one of the major powers . The difficulties ahead are great , but Negroes are not dismayed . In spite of all the roadblocks to progress so graphically catalogued in this indictment , the Negro people have produced scholars , artists , writers , scientists , and athletes in numbers and of a quality which command the respect and admiration of the white men who hold them down . Their record promises as long and persistent a fight before the U. N. as may be necessary to win the right to be heard when they demand that life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness in the United States no longer be " for whites only .
