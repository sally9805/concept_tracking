Cuba 's shrewd , ebullient President Fulgencio Batista is no dilettante in power politics . He is a tough hombre who speaks his mind . Last week , after visiting with Washington dignitaries in the U.S. , Batista said his piece about a pompous , would-be tough guy across the Atlantic . His theme : If the United Nations go to war with Francisco Franco 's Spain , Latin America will be on the United Nations ' side . <P> In Cuba , President Batista said , the only elements that would not applaud such a move are Cuban Falangists , now being rounded up in droves as fifth columnists . Possibly there was some hyperbole in Batista 's claim that an invasion of Spain would receive " a total ovation for the Allied cause throughout all Latin America . " But , by being blunt , Batista expressed for the first time the sentiments of millions of good friends of democracy in the Western Hemisphere who are tired of apologies and flatteries for Franco . <P> Bashed in the nose diplomatically , the Axis plugged new life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarks are a warning that " the Anglo-Saxon empires are planning to use Spain to create a new base against the Axis powers . " Axis broadcasts spread a report that Juan Negrin , last premier of the Spanish Republic , had arrived in Morocco from Britain ( where , last week , he was still living quietly in Hertfordshire ) , to build a political pre-invasion bridgehead to Spain . On more solid ground , a Berlin broadcast aligned " Franco Spain " with " National Socialist Germany , Fascist Italy , Laval France . " <P> Officially Franco still remained neutral . He sent his Foreign Minister , Count Francisco Gmez Jordana y Souza , and twelve military and diplomatic bigwigs for wining , dining and a joint accord on neutrality and anti-Communism with neighboring Portugal. * He welcomed home General Agustin Muoz Grande , recently decorated ( by Hitler ) commander of the Falangist Blue Division fighting in Russia . From his train window at the border , the general shouted : " Long live the mothers who begat the most valiant soldiers in the world . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain Nazi victory over Russian Bolshevism . " As forgetful of Spain 's claimed neutrality as Franco was in addressing the Falangist National Council ( TIME , Dec. 21 ) , the Falangist crowds set up their old cry for the return of Gibraltar , chanted cheers for " Franco , Spain and Germany . " <P> * Portuguese newspapers reported that it was the first time in 300 years that a Spanish foreign minister had paid an official call in Lisbon .
