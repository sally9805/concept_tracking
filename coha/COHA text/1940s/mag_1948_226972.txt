TIME 'S way of handling news should always produce a sense-making report . Occasionally , it achieves something more-a story that readers remember and quote and write about to TIME . After 15 years , many old TIME readers remember its story on the death and funeral of Calvin Coolidge . Written by John Shaw Billings ( then National Affairs editor , now editorial director ) , the story told simply and very clearly how the news of his death came to the Senate , the House , President Hoover , and to Mrs. Aurora Pierce , " longtime Coolidge housekeeper " at Plymouth , Vt . She " heard a tap on the homestead window . Allen Brown , a neighbor , was outside . She raised the sash to hear him say : ' Calvin 's dead , Aurora . ' " TIME told how the stockmarket , shocked , had fallen and then " closed with a brief little rally -a farewell salute to the man whose name has been given to the greatest bull market in history . " <P> TIME gave the circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary Ross-about the Plymouth place , last year 's pa'tridge shooting , hay fever . ... He evened up the pens on the desk . He went ' down cellar , ' watched the furnace man shovel coal . About noon he disappeared upstairs , presumably to shave , as so many New Englanders do about midday . " <P> Billings ' selection of detail told a lot about Calvin Coolidge , the stock from which he sprang , and a lot about the U.S. and about a period which , even in 1933 , was becoming dim . The " point " of the story was news because , although it may be hidden , the New England stamp , the shrewd , homely democracy of the little white towns , is impressed on the American character .
