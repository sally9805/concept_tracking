Old Uncle Rollin Coffee looked up from his hoeing and hailed Farmer Riley Ritchie , coming up the road . <P> " Well , Rile , I hear Andy 's come home agin . Did he graduate this time ? " <P> " Nope . " <P> Uncle Rollin ran his callused fingers through his white hair , spat and said : " Well , Rile , I do n't know nothin ' about a college . But I know one thing . There must be a heap to larn at college or else your Andy larns mighty slow ! " <P> But gaunt young Andrew Jackson Ritchie , back home in the Blue Ridge Mountains of northeastern Georgia for the second time because he had run out of money , went back to college for a third , fourth and fifth time . Finally , at 32 , he made it , came home to shake under Uncle Rollin 's nose a diploma from Harvard , where he graduated in 1899 with Henry James and a heap of other smart men . <P> Andy went off to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the purple , smoky hills and unlearned mountain folk of Georgia . So back he went , bought himself a small piece of land and began to keep school for his neighbors . His school , first called Rabun Gap , eventually merged with a small Presbyterian school with the Indian name Nacoochee and became the Rabun Gap-Nacoochee School . " Dr. Andy " developed it into a hillbilly college even stranger than its name . One part is a junior college for boys &; girls , who mix book learning with farm work , which pays most of their $222-a-year board and tuition . The other part is a school for farmers ' families-papa , mama and all the kids . <P> Dr. Andy believed that what Georgia 's hut-dwelling , soil-scratching , God-fearing mountain folk needed most was someone to teach them how to live and farm better . He bought more land , put up neat , comfortable farmhouses , let each family farm 40 acres with teachers to show them how . In classroom sessions that are more like town meetings than classes , the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discuss better housekeeping . Children spend part of their day in school , part learning chores . As payment for instruction , house and land , each family returns part of its produce to the school-half the crop on bottom lands , a third on hillsides . In choosing his students , Dr. Andy has observed two strict rules : he admitted only families that 1 ) had many children , 2 ) agreed to move on after five years to apply their learning on farms of their own . <P> Today Rabun Gap-Nacoochee School has 1,600 acres , a small endowment , a herd of 40 cattle , a new beef barn just completed by its students . Last week old Dr. Andy , now 75 and retired , noted with satisfaction that his little school was giving a good account of itself beyond , the Blue Ridge Mountains of Georgia . Seventy of his boys , nearly a third of all who have graduated from his junior college , went off to fight for their country . One , Marine Elza O'Neal , was captured on Wake Island ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . William R. Ussery , was killed in action in a plane in the Pacific ; a third , Lieut . Denver Truelove , flew with Jimmy Doolittle to bomb Tokyo .
