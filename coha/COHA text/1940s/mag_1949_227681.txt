W. C. FIELDS : His FOLLIES AND FORTUNES ( 340 pp. ) - Robert Lewis Taylor-Doubleday ( $3.50 ) . <P> At the age of nine , William Claude Dukinfield conceived a passion for juggling . In the Philadelphia stable where the family vegetable cart was stored , he practiced earnestly with oranges and lemons . But the elder Dukinfield took a dark view of his son 's ambition , and once he went as far as to tan him for bruising a lemon . Incensed beyond containment , William climbed aloft in the stable one day and dropped a large box on his father 's head . Then he left home , never to return . <P> Thus began the career of W. C. Fields . He slept , successively , in a hole in the ground , a forge , a bran trough in a livery stable , a barrel and a saloon toilet . To eat , he scavenged saloons and stole . Backsliding into respectability , he lived for a while with his grandmother , who made him get a job as a store " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorely tempted as Fields was . Then , at the age of 14 , he became a juggler in an amusement park . After that , his only work was to make people laugh . <P> Getaway Money . As Biographer Taylor sees it , Fields 's whole life was shaped and distorted by his childhood experiences . " Fields 's early grapples with things like hunger , frost , bartenders and police gave him a vast , watchful suspicion of society and its patterns . " As a comedian , he appealed to the streak of fundamental pessimism lurking in everybody . In grownups , children and animals he always expected the worst-and he was usually right . Audiences found it uproarious . <P> Actually , Fields was just doing what came naturally . He was eternally suspicious , intensely competitive and even at the peak of his career morbidly fearful of poverty . To avoid sudden bankruptcy , he developed the habit of starting small bank accounts all over the U.S. ; at one time he had 700 of them . Once Gene Fowler saw an eye-filling roll of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asked what the money was for , Fields answered in a tone that closed the discussion , " It 's getaway money . " <P> Blackjack Patrol . Fields squirmed at the thought that there might be comedians as he . He even accused Baby LeRoy of trying to steal scenes from him . Once , to get even , he spiked the infant 's orange juice with gin , and when it thereupon fell asleep , shouted with glee : " The kid 's no trouper . Send him home . " <P> His world was a paranoid Luna Park lit by alcohol and filled with ingenious contraptions for the exercise of harmless aggression and idiosyncratic suspicion . To find out if his servants were stealing canned goods , he set up an elaborate Dictaphone apparatus . To scare off kidnapers , he would prowl his grounds at 2 a.m. , armed with blackjacks and carrying on loud conversations with fictitious bodyguards . He never made his peace with the world because he saw no good reason to be at peace with it . <P> He became the idol of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gene Fowler ( who turned over all his notes to Biographer Taylor ) . An ex-newspaperman and author of some of The New Yorker 's smoothest profiles on amiable eccentrics , Taylor strings out the Fields anecdotes ( first serialized in the Saturday Evening Post ) with skill and devotion , content to be entertaining about one of America 's greatest entertainers .
