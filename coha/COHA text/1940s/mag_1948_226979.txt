( See Cover ) <P> It was Lent . On Manhattan 's Fifth Avenue , a woman and a little girl were stopped by the traffic at a cross street . On the opposite curb stood a young man with an Ash Wednesday mark on his forehead . " Look , " said the little girl . " Must n't point , " said the woman . " But mother , " asked the little girl , " why has he got that black mark on his forehead ? " " Hush , " said her mother . " It 's something they do in church , I think . " <P> With prayer , with humility of spirit tempering his temerity of mind , man has always sought to define the nature of the most important fact in his experience : God . To this unending effort to know God , man is driven by the noblest of his intuitions-the sense of his mortal incompleteness-and by hard experience . For man 's occasional lapses from God-seeking inevitably result in intolerable shallowness of thought combined with incalculable mischief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the nature of the atom . But he knows almost nothing about the nature of God , almost never thinks about it , and is complacently unaware that there may be any reason to . Theology , the intellectual system whereby man sorts out his thoughts about faith and grace , enjoys much less popular appeal than astrology . With its " devolutionary theopantism " * and " axiological eschatology , " * theology is jaw-breakingly abstract . And its mood is widely felt to be about as bracing as an unaired vestry . <P> Worthy Habit . This is scarcely strange , since among millions of Christians religion itself is little more than a worthy mental habit , socially manifested in church attendance often more sporadic and much less disturbing than regular visits to the dentist . <P> To the mass of untheological Christians , God has become , at best , a rather unfairly furtive presence , a lurking luminosity , a cozy thought . At worst , He is conversationally embarrassing . There is scarcely any danger that a member of the neighborhood church will , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whirlwinds are dangerous ) , or that he will be moved to dash down the center aisle , crying , like Isaiah : " Howl , ye ships of Tarshish ! " <P> Under the bland influence of the idea of progress , man , supposing himself more &; more to be the measure of all things , achieved a singularly easy conscience and an almost hermetically smug optimism . The idea that man is sinful and needs redemption was subtly changed into the idea that man is by nature good and hence capable of indefinite perfectibility . This perfectibility is being achieved through technology , science , politics , social reform , education . Man is essentially good , says 20th Century liberalism , because he is rational , and his rationality is ( if the speaker happens to be a liberal Protestant ) divine , or ( if he happens to be religiously unattached ) at least benign . Thus the reason-defying paradoxes of Christian faith are happily bypassed.
