In Jersey City , on July 2 , 1921 , U. S. sport fans witnessed a milestone in prizefight annals : the first million-dollar gate . Last week , on the 19th anniversary of that historic Dempsey-Carpentier battle , Jersey City was the scene of another heavyweight prize fight that will probably go down in history as the wretchedest of the post-Dempsey era . <P> Grappling for the role of challenger for the world 's heavyweight championship were two washed-up fighters : Barkeep Tony Galento , a beer-bibbing ham- &-egger; who had never heard of the Marquess of Queensberry , and Madcap Maxie Baer , who had been floundering around in the second division since losing his world 's title to Jim Braddock in 1935 . Both were over 30 , had already been knocked out by Champion Joe Louis . <P> Some 22,000 fight fans went to see the show . The boys slugged , slapped , tugged , butted , pushed , did everything but reach for their water bottles . In the first round , Baer went after the fresh wound on Galento 's chin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beer glass at him two nights before . By the seventh round Galento was spouting blood , reeling drunkenly , his eyes closed , his head throbbing where he had landed with a running , broad butt at Baer 's jaw . When the bell rang for the eighth round , Galento sat on his stool , called it quits . <P> Among the spectators who watched last week 's burlesque with something more than amusement was Jack Dempsey . Only the night before , the onetime world 's champion , who had earned some $5,000,000 in the ring , had started a pugilistic " comeback " at 45 . In Atlanta , during two rounds of roughhouse scrapping that left him wobbly-kneed , he had knocked out of the ring one Cowboy Luttrell , a fat , 34-year-old wrestler who had taken a poke at him during a wrestling match which he refereed last spring . <P> Though sport fans mourned his doing so , the onetime Tiger Man went ahead with his " comeback " plans . Though far from broke ( he had no direct interest in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough of his funds are tied up in the Jack Dempsey Broadway Bar , the Dempsey Distilling Co. and other projects so that he can use $3,000 to $5,000 cash , to be picked up-along with publicity- from a small-time fight now &; then . His next opponent : Bull Curry , a Hartford ( Conn. ) policeman who " has done a little wrestling . "
