September was the worst month of the war for Japanese aviation . U.S. flyers destroyed more than 1,300 planes - close to the maximum monthly output credited to Jap factories by the most conservative U.S. authorities . <P> About 200 planes were credited to pilots from the Mountbatten , MacArthur and Chennault commands , but carrier-based navymen of Vice Admiral Marc A. Mit-scher 's task force , from Halsey 's Third Fleet , went on a more destructive ram page . In seven carrier raids from Aug. 30 to Sept. 25 ( four of them over the Philip pines ) 1,101 Jap planes were destroyed . Significantly , Halsey 's fourth raid , an nounced last week , was met by only seven Jap planes in the central Philippines . Left on the ground for Marc Mit-scher 's pilots to destroy were only 29 others . <P> There was a good explanation for the carrier men 's stealing the show : Jap planes nowadays stay out of range of land-based aircraft ; only far-ranging carriers can reach Jap flyers , who have all but abandoned offensive air operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her Inner defense citadel , her supply lines become shorter . Navy Under-Secretary Ralph Bard said last fortnight that Japan may even have a shipping surplus now to transport the leavings of her once-great Empire traffic . But not even the shortest supply lines can withstand the loss of about 600 small and large ships which the Empire suffered in September . Most of Japan 's losses occurred in the Philip pines , where Mitscher 's flyers sank 205 vessels of all sizes , damaged over 200 more . <P> In these devastating attacks against planes and ships Mitscher 's force lost 61 planes to enemy action . Once again it was clear that the U.S. 's vast carrier-borne air power was capable of smothering land-based air defenses . <P> At Palau . On the ground , where Japs dig in and wait to be rooted out with grenade and bayonet , no such overwhelming combat superiority is possible . Yet more than 10,000 Japs had been killed on Peleliu and Angaur in the southern Palaus . ( By last weekend seven other nearby small islands had been occupied , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small pocket on Angaur and " Bloody Nose " Ridge on Peleliu . <P> Last week the haggard ist Marine Division got some help from fresh units of the 81st Army Division , which landed , pushed through 4.000 yds. , then encircled Bloody Nose . Peleliu 's collapse was only a matter of time , might come in the typical banzai charge wherein all Japs are killed or kill themselves . <P> But even before last week 's casualties had been counted , Peleliu 's hillside caves and mangrove swamps had not come cheap . The marines killed more than 8,000 Japs but lost 981 in killed and missing ( against Tarawa 's 984 ) , had 3,639 wounded ( against Tarawa 's 2,072 ) . Percentagewise , the 81st Infantry Division 's losses on Angaur were higher . In killing 1,075 Japs , the soldiers had 880 casualties : 106 dead , five missing , 769 wounded .
