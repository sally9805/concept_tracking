txt Vice Admiral Emery ! S. Land told Congress America 's hopes of holding top rank as a post-war merchant Imarine power are being imperiled by the lack of vital legislation . Testifying before the House Merchant Marine Committee on a proposed ship disphsal bill , the chairman of the Maritime Commission said : " Unless we have constructive legislation relating to ship sales at a very early date , 1 fear that the great opportunity that now exists to lay the groundwork for a healthy and adequate merchant marine under private ownership and operation will be permanently lost . " The present lack of a definite policy is already tending to stimulate shipbuilding abroad . " Adm . Land suggested that the Maritime Commission have the power to restrict the amount of surplus merchant ship tonnage sold to foreign operators " to such number of vessels as will not increase the merchant fleet under such foreign Rag beyond its pre-war size . "
