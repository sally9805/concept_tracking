Navy 's most unusual lieutenant commander-Columnist Walter Winchell-last week reported for active duty , was assigned to the press section of the Third Naval District ( New York ) . Four days a week , without pay , he will work for Navy ; in his spare time , he will do his Broadway column and Sunday night broadcast . <P> Proud of being overworked , Winchell flashes : " Did you ever hear of anybody doing a bit more than he has to ? "
