Frank Eichelberger , chubby-cheeked president of Kalunite , Inc. , had got the run-around from OPM for months on his plans to make aluminum from alunite ( TIME , June 16 ) . Last week , testifying at a Senate Defense Committee hearing in Seattle , he had a chance to crack back . He snapped at it like an angry smallmouth : <P> Eichelberger : The gloves are off on this thing . I 'm a careful man , but I 'm mad now , Senators . <P> Chairman Truman : We want to take the gloves off . This committee has been trying to get aluminum ever since last April . <P> Eichelberger : Okay . I 'm mad and here we go . <P> Then Eichelberger told a story that made members of the committee mad too . His alunite process has been approved by the Bureau of Mines and OPM 's own technical staff , has been used successfully in Japan . But 0PM , which has persistently favored the process used by Aluminum Co. of America , cold-shouldered Eichelberger from the start . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation 's aluminum shortage , OPM did finally name Kalunite 's parent company ( Olin Corp. ) to operate a Government-owned plant . But OPM did not specify whether alunite ore could be used , hemmed &; hawed over location of the plant . Eichelberger wanted to build on tidewater at Tacoma , use Bonneville Dam power . He called on Clifton H. Chadwick , an OPM consulting engineer , to suggest this plan . His description of the meeting : " I was treated with all the courtesy of a cross-eyed stepchild . " Later Chadwick visited the site , ruled that it was unsuitable , suggested another location " 15 miles out in the woods " where construction and transportation costs would be multiplied . <P> Details of Chadwick 's inspection were supplied by Frank Walsh of the Tacoma Chamber of Commerce : <P> Walsh : Chadwick was accompanied by T. D. Jollie , chief engineer for Alcoa . . . . They drove by twice , but nobody got out and looked over the site . Later Chadwick called and said that Jollie declared it would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Jollie had the veto power . <P> Eichelberger : It 's just another thing to slow this up . We could have been producing two months ago . <P> Senator Mead : You 're saying that OPM is trying to force an unfavorable site on you to force you out of the picture ? <P> Eichelberger : Yes , sir , exactly . <P> Senator Truman : . . . This has all the earmarks of a maneuver by OPM to turn over full control of the aluminum industry to Alcoa . <P> This week Engineer Jollie said he had indeed looked at the Kalunite site with Engineer Chadwick . Reason : OPM had asked Alcoa to build the plant for Olin . Mr. Jollie vetoed Mr. Eichelberger 's site because it was on tidal land . <P> Mr. Eichelberger insisted that the site was fine for alunite-aluminum production , was not feasible if bauxite-aluminum production ( whose carbon furnaces require deep pits ) was planned . The fact that Alcoa was to build his plant was news to him . If OPM was not giving him the runaround @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
