In Palestine last week , an earnest gesture of peace became a clever pretext for war . Last September , U.N . ' s Count Bernadotte made a ruling on the hotly contested supply routes in the northern tip of the Negeb desert . The Egyptian army , he said , could use the roads for six hours each afternoon to supply their forces in the interior across an east-west road running under Jewish guns . The Jews , in turn , would have six hours each morning to supply their settlements in the Negeb across a north-south road blocked by Arab troops . When the Egyptians rejected the ruling , it became a dead letter . Since then , the Jews have supplied their settlements by night airlifts to secret landing strips in the desert . <P> This worked all right through the summer , but now the rainy season is approaching ; floods from the hills of Hebron will soon make the airlift impossible . Ben-Gurion met last week with his chiefs and decided to act . Having ordered picked Israeli troops to the Negeb front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) informed U.N . truce officials that they would move a convoy over the disputed highway between the stipulated hours . When the convoy moved down the highway , the Egyptians ( as the Israelis had foreseen ) opened fire . The second U.N . truce came to a blazing end . <P> The fighting that followed was in deadly earnest . The same evening , as prearranged , Israeli bombers took off on what the government called an " action to open and keep open the convoy routes to and in the Negeb . " Some of the heaviest bomb-loads yet dropped in the Holy <P> Land fell on Gaza ( seat of the Mufti 's new Arab government in Palestine ) . Arab forces opened up on Jewish settlements in the Negeb with 100-pound guns . Both sides rejected a U.N . cease fire order . <P> At week 's end Ben-Gurion was beaming . For the first time since May , Israel had a wide , firm land corridor to her settlements in the Negeb . Israeli forces were also hammering closer &; closer to Gaza , chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped that U.N . delegates in Paris , now discussing Palestine , would agree with Israel that the best solution was an old formula : possession is nine points of the law .
