It was BBC 's latest television stunt . A willowy wisp of a girl last week climbed into a 190-lb. diving suit and tangoed around ( with a suitably dressed partner ) in a tank containing 15 feet of water . The girl : ash blonde Gillian Webb*-the 20-year-old who , with two older colleagues , does all the BBC 's television announcing , a job which ordinarily demands only an ability to chat at a battery of cameras . <P> Unlike many an image projected by BBC 's frankly experimental television system ( there are 25,000 British television sets-more than twice as many as in the U.S. ) , Gillian Webb is pretty as a picture . But it took a deal more than a pretty face to persuade sober BBC to give one of its top television situations to a chit of a girl . To get the job , Gillian had to beat 400 other applicants . <P> But Gillian had long been working up to just such tests . At 17 , when her widow-mother could not afford tuition at London 's Royal Academy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a prize for " grace and charm of speech and movement . " At 19 , after a swing through the provinces as a speechless Shakespearean lady-in-waiting , she toured the Near East with an E.N.S.A . ( Britain 's U.S.O. ) girl show . Last spring , she got her big break in television . <P> *No kin to hydrophile Matthew Webb , who swam the English Channel in 1875.
