txt FUTURE generations may deem it noteworthy that the supreme question of whether we should fight on alone never found a place upon the War Cabinet Agenda . It was taken for granted and as a matter of course by these men of all parties in the State , and we were much too busy to waste time upon such unreal , academic issues . We were united also in viewing the new phase with good confidence . It . was decided to tell the Dominions the whole facts . I was invited to send a message in the same sense to President Roosevelt , and also to sustain the determination of the French Government and assure them of our utmost support . Former Naval Person to President Roosevelt . 12. v1.40 . I spent last ; light and this morning at the French G.Q.G. , where the situation was explained to me in the gravest terms by Generals Weygand and Georges . You have no doubt received full particulars from Mr. Bullitt . The practical point is what will happen when and if the French front breaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his Government that France can no longer continue what he calls ' co-ordinated war ' . The aged Marshal P ? tain , who was none too good in April and July , 1918 , is , I fear , ready to lend his name and prestige to a treaty of peace for France . Reynaud , on the other hand , is for fighting on , and he has a young General de Gaulle , who believes much can be done . Admiral Darlan declares he will send the French Fleet to Canada . It would be disastrous if the two big modern ships fell into bad hands . It seems to me that there must be many elements in France who will wish to continue the struggle either in France or in the French colonies , or in both . This therefore is the moment for you to strengthen Reynaud the utmost you can , and try to tip the balance in favour of the best and longest possible French resistance . I venture to put this point before you , although I know you must understand it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made my last visit to France for four years almost to a day .. The French Government had now withdrawn to Tours , and tension had mounted steadily . I took Edward Halifax and General Ismay with me , and Max Beaverbrook volunteered to come too . In trouble he is always buoyant . This time the weather was cloudless , and we sailed over in the midst of our Hurricane squadron , making however a rather wider sweep to the southwarc. than before . Arrived over Tours , we found the airport had been heavily bombed the night before , but we and all our escort landed smoothly in spite of the craters . Immediately one sensed the increasing degeneration of affairs . No one came to meet us or seemed to expect us . ' We borrowed a service car from the Station Commander and motored into the city , making for the Prefecture , where it was said the French Government had their headquarters . No one of consequence was there , but Reynaud was reported to be motoring in from the country , and Mandel was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I insisted upon luncheon , and after some parleyings we drove ' through streets crowded with refugees ' cars , most of them with a mattress on top and crammed with luggage . We found , a. caf ? , which was closed but after explanations we obtained a meal . We then returned to the Prefecture , where Mandel , Minister of the Interior , awaited us . This faithful former secretary of Clemenceau , and a bearer forward of his life 's message , seemed in the best of spirits . He was energy and defiance personified . His luncheon , an attractive chicken , was uneaten on the tray before him . He was a ray of sunshine . He had a telephone in each hand , through which he was constantly giving orders and , decisions . His ideas were simple : fight on to the end in France , in order to cover the largest possible movement into Africa . This was the last time I saw this valiant Frenchman . The restored French Republic rightly shot to death the hirelings who murdered him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . pRESENTLY M. Reynaud arrived . At first he seemed depressed . . General Weygand had reported to him that the French armies were exhausted . The line was pierced in many places ; refugees were pouring along all the roads through the country , and many of the troops were in disorder . The Generalissimo felt it was necessary to ask for an armistice while there were still enough French troops to keep order until peace could be made . Such was the military advice . He would send that day a further message to Mr. Roosevelt saying that the last hour had come and that the fate of the Allied cause lay in America 's hand . Hence arose the alternative of armistice and peace . M. Reynaud proceeded to say that the Council of Ministers had on the previous day instructed him to inquire what would be Britain 's attitude should the worst come . He himself was well aware of the solemn pledge that no separate peace would be entered into by either ally . General Weygand and others pointed out that France had already sacrificed everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she had succeeded in greatly weakening the . common foe ! It would in those circumstances be a shock if Britain failed . to concede that France was physically unable to carry on , if France was still expected to fight on and thus deliver up her people to the certainty of corruption and evil transformation at the hands of ruthless specialists in the art of bringing conquered peoples to heel . That then was the question which he had to put . Would Great Britain realise , the hard facts with which France was faced ? I thought the issue raised at this point was so serious that I asked to withdraw with my colleagues before answering it . So Lords Halifax and Beaverbrook a4c1 the rest of our party went out into a dripping but sunlit garden and talked things over for half an hour . On our return I stated our position . We could not agree to a separate peace however it might come . Our ' war aim remained the total defeat of Hitler , and we felt that we could still bring this about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release France from her obligation . Whatever happened , we would level no reproaches against France ; but that was a different matter from consenting to release her from her pledge . I urged that the French should now send a new appeal to President Roose- , velt , which we would support from London . M. Reynaud agreed to do this , and promised that the French would hold on until the result of his final appeal was known . ' Before leaving I made one particular request to M. Reyna.ud , Over 400 German pilots , the bulk of whom had been shot down by the R.A.F. , were prisoners in France . Having regard to the situation , they should be handed over to our custody . M. Reynaud willingly gave this promise , but soon he had no power to keep it . These German pilots all became available fox the Battle of , Britain , and we had to shoot them down a second time . * * At the end of our talk M. Reynaud took us into the adjoining room , where MM . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate respectively , were seated . Both these French patriots spoke with passionate emotion about fighting on to the death . As we went down the crowded passage into the courtyard I saw General de Gaulle standing stolid and expressionless at the doorway . Greeting him , I said in a low tone , in French : " L'homme du destin . " He remained impassive . In the courtyard there must have been more than a hundred leading Frenchmen in frightful . misery . Clemenceau 's son was brought up to me . I wrung his hand . The Hurricanes were already in the air , and I slept sound on our swift and uneventful journey home . This was wise , for there was a long way to go before bed-time . * After our departure from Tours at about half past five M. Reynaud met his Cabinet again at Cange . The decision was taken to move the French Government to Bordeaux , and Reynaud sent off his telegram to Roosevelt with its desperate appeal for the entry .. on the scene at least of the American Fleet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new report to the Cabinet . My account was endorsed by my two companions . While we were still sitting Ambassador Kennedy arrived with President Roosevelt 's reply to Reynaud 's appeal of June 10 . President Roosevelt to M. Reynaud. 13 . VI.40 . Your message of June 10 has moved me very deeply . As I have already stated to you and to Mr. Churchill , this Government is doing everything in its power to make available to the Allied Governments the material they so urgently require , and our efforts to do still more are being redoubled . This is so because of our faith in and our support of the ideals for which tile Allies are fighting . The magnificent resistance of the French and British Armies has profoundly impressed the American people . I am , personally , particularly impressed by your declaration that France will continue to ? fight on behalf of Democracy , even if it means slow withdrawal , even to North Africa and the Atlantic . It is most important to remember that the French and British Fleets continue in mastery of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vital materials from the outside world are necessary to maintain all armies . I am also , greatly heartened by what Prime Minister Churchill said a few days ago about the continued resistance of the British Empire , and that determination would seem to apply equally to the great French Empire all over the world . Naval power in world affairs still carries the lessons of history , as Admiral Dalian well knows . We all thought the President had gone a very long way . He had authorised Reynaud to publish his message of June 10 , with all that that implied , and now he had sent this formidable answer . If , upon this , France decided to endure the further torture of the war , the United States would be deeply committed to enter it . At any rate , it contained two points which were tantamount to belligerence : first , a promise of all material aid , which implied active assistance ; secondly , a call to go on fighting even if the Government were driven right out of France . I sent our thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to commend the President 's message to Reynaud in the most favourable terms . Former Naval Person to President Roosevelt . 13 . VI.40. * * While we were flying back here your magnificent message was sent , and Ambassador Kennedy brought it to me on my arrival . The British Cabinet we .. e profoundly impressed , and desire me to express their gratitude for it , but , Mr. President , I ? ust tell you that it seems to me absolutely vital that this message should be published to-morrow , June 14 , in order that it may play the decisive part in turning the course of world history . It will , I am sure , decide the French to ' deny Hitler a patched-up peace with France . He needs this peace in order to destroy us and take a long step forward to world mastery . All the far-reaching plans , strategic , economic , political and moral , which your message expounds , may be still-born if the French cut out now . Therefore , I urge that the message should be published now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not dictate a Nazi peace in Paris he will turn his fury on to us . We shall do our best to withstand it , and if we succeed wide new doors are open upon the future and all will come out even at the end of the day . To M. Reynaud I sent this message : 13 . VI.40. * * * If France on this message of President Roosevelt 's continues in the field and in the war , we feel that the United States is committed beyond recall to take the only remaining step , namely , becoming a belligerent in form as she already has constituted herself in fact . Constitution of United States makes it impossible , as you foresaw , for the President to declare war himself , but , if you act on his reply now received , we sincerely believe that this must inevitably follow . We are asking the President to allow publication of the message , but , even if he does not agree to this for a day or two , it is on the record and can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and your colleagues , whose resolution we so much admired to-day , not to miss this sovereign opportunity of bringing about the world-wide oceanic and economic coalition which must be fatal to Nazi domination . We see before us a definite plan of campaign , and the light which you spoke of shines at the end of the tunnel . Finally , in accordance with the Cabinet 's wishes , I sent a formal message of good cheer to the French Government in which the note of an indissoluble union between our two countries was struck for the first time . - All these three messages were drafted by me before I went to bed after midnight on the 13th . They were written actually in the small hours of the 14th . The next day arrived a telegram from the President explaining that he could not agree to the publication of his message to Reynaud . He himculf , according to Mr. Kennedy , had . wished to do so , but the State Department , while in full sympathy with him , saw the gravest dangers . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but he then said he had told Ambassador Kennedy to inform me that his message of the 14th was in no sense intended to commit and did not commit the Government of the United States to military participation . There was no authority under the American Constitution except Congress which could make any commit , ment of that nature . He bore particularly in mind the question , of the French Fleet . Congress , at his desire , bad appropriated fifty million dollars for the purpose of supplying food and clothing to civilian refugees in France . Finally he assured m6 that he appreciated ' the significance and weight of what I had set forth in my message . This was a disappointing telegram . Around our table we all fully understood the risks the President ran of being charged with exceeding his constitutional authority , and consequently of being defeated on this issue at the approaching election , on which our fate , and much more , depended . I was convinced that he would give up life itself , to say nothing of public office , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peril . But w t would have been the good of that ? Across t e Atlantic I could feel his suffering . In the White House the torment was of a different character from that of Bordeaux or London . But the degree of personal stress was not unequal . In my reply I tried to arm the President with some arguments which he could use to others about the danger to the United States if Europe fell and Britain failed . This was no matter of sentiment , but of life and  --  death . Former Naval Person to President Roosevelt . 14-15 . VI.40 . Although the present Government and I personally would never fail to send the Fleet across the Atlantic if resistance was beaten down here , a point may be reached in the struggle where the present Ministers no longer have control of affairs and when very easy terms could be obtained for the British Island by their becoming a vassal state of the Hitler Empire . A ptoGerman Government would certainly be-called into being to make peace , and might present to a shattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submission to the Nazi will . The fate of the British Fleet , as I have already mentioned to you , would be decisive on the future of the United States , because if it were joined to the Fleets of Japan , France and , Italy and the great resources of German industry overwhelming sea power - would be in Hitler 's hands . He might of course use it with a merciful moderation . On the other hand , he might not . This revolution in sea power might happen very quickly , and certainly long before the United States would be able to prepare against it . If we go down you may have a United States of Europe under the . Nazi command far more numerous , far stronger , tar better armed than the New World . I know well , Air . President , that your eye will already have searched these depths , but I feel I have the right to place on record the vital manner in which American interests are at stake in our battle and that of France . * * Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse . The German opera. , Book I ? The Fall of France tions north-west of Paris , in which our 51st Division had been lost , had brought the enemy , by June 9 , to the lower reaches of the Seine and the Oise . The capital fell on the 14th . On June 17. it was announced that the Petain Government had asked for an armistice , ordering all French forces to cease fighting , without even communicating this information to our troops . General Brooke was consequently told to come away with all men he could embark and any equipment he could save . We repeated now on a considerable scale , though with larger vessels , the Dunkirk evacuation . At Brest and the western ports the evacuations were numerous . The German air attack on the transports Was heavy . One frightful incident occurred on the 17th at St. Nazaire . The 20,000-ton liner Lancastria , with five thousand men on board , was bombed and set on fire just as she was about to leave . A mass of flaming oil spread over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men perished . The rest were rescued under continued air attack by the devotion of the small craft . When this news came to me in the quiet Cabinet Room during the afternoon I forbade its publication , saying , " The newspapers have got quite enough disaster for to-day at least " . I had intended to release the news a few days later , but events crowded upon us so black and so quickly that I forgot to npi the ban , and it was some years before the kr owledge of this horror became public .
