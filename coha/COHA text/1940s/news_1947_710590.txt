txt It seems that our ? they Are city scout has not been Off able to get his mind off Again the horse races  --  he explains that the obsession is hereditary and has no serious connection with what Frederick C. Mortimer , who for many year ? took care of this corner , liked to call " aleatory pursuits . " Unreconstructed horsemen , he says , were interested in the race run last Saturday for the Empire Gold Cup and James Butler 's added $100,000 because it was over a longer distance  --  a mile and five furlongs  --  than our cracks are often expected to cover . Consequently the only critters entered were horses of proved staying power , at least up to our top limit of a mile and a half ; and these included the survivors of the tests of four seasons . The lesson of this The Long present season has and seemed to be ( he went The Short on ) that our system is producing sprinters rather than the , horse preferred by George Washington that can go along and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of this season 's crop that had shown that quality finished fourth . The winner was a sixyear-old , very well proved , indeed , both in victory and defeat . Admitting that the motor car now takes care of the main job of going and keeping on going , the scout liked to think that the race was a warning to the horsemen , who had started racing to improve the breed of horses . It had been a sign Airborne of the times that ' and this season had seen Ground Forces race horses take to flying , not on their four feet , nor by growing wings of their own like Pierian Pegasus , but using the same mechanical contrivance that has enabled us bipeds to get places by air . It began with one of the Kentucky Derby contenders , a California horse , who dropped out of the sky on Churchill Downs . Mr. Butler 's race was planned as an international event in which whole squadrons of flying horses from abroad would try issues with us . It had n't turned out quite that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Latin America were on the track , what really happened was a competition among our own , so to speak , ground forces . Flying horses across Touching an ocean introduces , of an course , an extra hazard Old Grudge and gives the native ground forces a certain advantage . But ( the scout thought ) another matter had come up which had not been put in quite the right perspective . It was said that the English horses had stayed home because of something which has long rankled in the breast of the American horse breeder . The English stud book , which barred from English tracks even our magnificent Man o ' War on account of a bend sinister , excludes on the same ground both Stymie , handsome chestnut who turned out to be the winner of this race , and Assault , elected favorite of the patrons of the betting machines . But after all , said the Pride scout , it was the Islandof ers behind the white Creation cliffs of Dover who , some two centuries or less back , created out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the distaff side the Thoroughbred , ' now the race horse of all nations . He was , in fact , known at first simply as the English Horse . Naturally , Britons feel personally responsible for maintaining the pure blood of the breed . Besides ; they deserve sympathy rather than reproaches . French horses carried off top honors on England 's own tracks this season . And the Islanders , though unbowed , were not amused . Anyway , it was a Home great race and it was on nice to have our Good the Range Neighbors the Brazilians in the game . As for the result , the scout admitted with a grin that his money was on the little Texas horse that failed to win for the - first time this season . But it was worth noting that both this horse  --  the public 's favorite as well as his own ? and . , the winner , as well , were bred in the Lone Star State and on the King Ranch , a place where horses were still used for something else than running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people forbidden Eby law to gamble except at race tracks furnished with machines which give the Government a cut of the winnings.
