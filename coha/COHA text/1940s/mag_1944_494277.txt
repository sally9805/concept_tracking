Correspondence The AP and the CIO-PAC SIR : Here is a little more comment on the role of the Associated Press in the election , discussed in my article " Gang-Up on the PAC " ( The New Republic , October 3o ) . On the morning of October 18 , the New York Bureau of the AP phoned me concerning a story they had just released on their wires stating that Charles Bolline , president of local 229 , United Automobile Workers ( CIO ) , of Plainfield , New Jersey , had announced that more than a thousand members of his union had voted against making contributions to CIO-PAC . Another " revolt " story , with the usual charges of " coercion . " It had originated , incidentally , in The Plainfield Courier-News , a Frank Gannett newspaper . The AP asked me for " comment . " At 6:zo that evening ( October 18 ) , I sent them some comment , in the form of a statement given to me by Mr. Bolline in which he branded this whole story as completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messenger . The following morning I inquired of the AP what had happened to this Bolline statement , which disclosed that this was another phony " revolt . " I was told that the AP had killed it . Their stated reason was that someone on the AP had talked 748 with Mr. Bolline by telephone and had been told that he repudiated this second statement and stood by the " revolt " story . I immediately phoned Mr. Bolline and was told that this was not true , that he stood by his statement branding the " revolt " story as false , and further , that he had brought a copy of this denial to the Gannett newspaper in Plainfield the preceding evening with a demand that they print it as their retraction on page one , to give it equal display with the first and false story . As proof , Mr. Bolline sent me a clipping from the Gannett Plainfield paper of October to ( the next issue following their first report ) . This carried their retraction , in the fonn of the Bolline denial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In it Mr. Bolline said , among other things : " The entire purported statement which has been attributed to me is false from beginning to end and is obviously part of the familiar reactionary attempt to smear PAC . . . . " This the Gannett paper printed , with further comment by Bolline to the effect that there was no opposition in the union to the PAC , but , on the contrary , complete cooperation . I phoned the AP again , giving them this information , but again was told that they would n't release the story . I then brought the matter to the attention of Kent Cooper , AP executive director , and Alan Gould , assistant general manager , in a letter dated October 26 . As yet , neither Mr. Cooper nor Mr. Gould has replied . New York City SIR : Thank you for the opportunity to comment on Mr. Maguire 's letter . As I have told Mr. Maguire a number of times , we feel that in covering any dispute between a local labor leader and a national organization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story from the local labor leader , and the national organization 's side of it from the national organization . Our Newark bureau got the Plainfield story from our Plainfield correspondent but also checked it direct with Mr. Bolline before putting the story on the wires . Shortly after the story had been transmitted , we asked Mr. Maguire for comment from the CIO-PAC . He gave us two paragraphs of comment , and this was sent immediately ( a fact which Mr. Maguire fails to mention in his letter ) . Later Mr. Maguire sent us a statement which he said Mr. Bolline had made repudiating his earlier announcement . Naturally we did not put on the wires a statement purporting to come from one party in a controversy but actually coming to us from the other party . But our Newark office , advised of the statement from Mr. Maguire , checked Mr. Bolline himself , again by phone . And again they were told by Mr. Bolline that our original story was all right . VICTOR HACKLER , Chief of New York Bureau , New York City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , New Jersey , situation as detailed by Fred Maguire are correct . The story that was attributed to me that I said that topoo members of Local 229 UAW ( CIO ) had revolted against the PAC was false . My statement so branding that report was given by me to Fred Maguire , who sent it to the Associated Press . In addition , I brought a copy of my statement to The Plainfield Courier-News with a demand that they publish it as their retraction of the original story published on October 18 . The Courier-News did so publish the retraction on October to . Furthermore , no one from The Associated Press has called me regarding this statement . CHARLES M. BOLLINE Plainfield , N. 1 .

Not only from my personal viewpoint , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you people in the editorial rooms know what a magnificent job ' The New Republic has done ? Through these many hard , long sears of obstinate opposition , The New Republic has been reproof , enlightenment and incitement ; and what its influence has been , and what the awakening by reason of its keen intelligence , are not to be writ " ten by my poor pen .

Sometimes I have let my subscription lapse when I experimented with another liberal journal because I was afraid that I was letting you foil ? my opinions or because I thought that you were getting " scoldy .

The New Republic , always eentrar eous and of pure intention and , as nearly as may be , right . Utica , N. Y. DWIGHT C. PITCSIg DECEMBER 4 ) 1944 " The Rainbow " SIR : Mr. Manny Farber 's review of " The Rainbow " The New Republic , November 6 is really an insult to your readers as well as to the Russian people , of whose epic sufferings and heroism it records but one terrible episode . Alexandra Drayman was a Russian woman , who went out to live in the woods and cook for the guerrillas when her native village was occupied by the Germans . She was pregnant , and only at the very last minute returned to her village to have her baby . The Nazis caught her and tortured her to make her reveal the whereabouts of the guerrilla band . They drove her barefoot through the snow at night , poking her with bayonets . They threw her into a freezing shed , where her baby was born . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her her baby 's life in return for the information about her comrades . When she refused , he murdered the baby before her eyes . Then they murdered her and threw her into the river . This story is true . So is the story of Maidanek , with its poison chambers , its death ovens , its hundreds of thousands of pairs of shoes of men , women and babies , stripped from them before they were murdered and carefully stacked and classified to be sent on order to different parts of Germany . Wanda Wassilevska wrote a novel about what happened to Alexandra Drayman and the others in the village , a novel based on what has happened to millions of Russian people , and she also wrote the film version , which faithfully follows the novel . This picture is perhaps as close as the American people will ever come to the reality of what the Russian people have endured . But your reviewer is not impressed by the cruelty of the Nazis , who , he whines , " are shown only as craven murderers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounded prisoners . " The millions of bodies of babies , children , mothers and wounded prisoners which American correspondents have seen in the mass graves they have looked into are sufficient answer to this . And we need no reminder from Mr. Farber that these child-murderers are also the soldiers of that Wehrmacht which has meant the deaths of millions of soldiers of all the United Nations , including thousands of our American men . Your reviewer is impressed by the " cruel-mindedness " of the Russians -- especially of the Russian woman who thinks a quick death too easy a punishment for the Nazis who have tortured and murdered her own countrymen , her own fellow townsmen and her own son . Mr. Farber is not judging this picture from a technical or an artistic point of view . Through his review he is making a treacherous attack on our Russian ally and a plea for a soft peace for our Nazi enemies . It seems to me this is a pretty bad blot on The New Republic 's record , which should be wiped out by sending some honest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on what it really means . New York City SIR : I am sure ; as I was long before I saw " The Rainbow , " that the kind of event treated in it has occurred over and over where the Nazis have been . But " The Rainbow 's " treatment of this event seems to me as brutal and evil in purpose as it could be . I think this because it tries to strip its characters , and moreover its audience , of every feeling and thought except cold , clear murderousness , revenge and hate . Its encouragement of this blind emotion seems to me as dangerous and intolerable as it has been shown to be in the practice of it by the Nazis . Every note in " The Rainbow " attempts to hit that place in you that will make you feel there is one thing to know about Germans ( or about this war ) ? that those Germans are all craven murderers , and that there is one thing to do about them : kill them : I do n't believe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent of " The Rainbow 's " simplification . It does n't make the least effort to examine the murderousness it brands all Germans with , nor to wonder what the consequences will be of its unrestricted program for killing German prisoners . At every point " The Rainbow " tries to narrow , if not obliterate , intelligence and feeling and to freeze both at the level of hate by repetition of the kind of incident Miss Smith mentions , hoping you will accept what it shows you as the whole truth . " The Rainbow " has a program to present and it is trying to make you believe it at the expense of everything in you except your capacity to hate . Miss Smith should not evade the fact that " The Rainbow " is determined to make barbarism not only a trait of every Nazi but of every German . I see no more truth in a movie that says " They kill because they are Germans , " or " These Germans ( who are murdering , etc. ) behaved as Germans , " than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or nation . Nor should Miss Smith evade examining the solution of " The Rainbow , " which specifically advises that all German prisoners be killed and puts forth a concept of the courts for trying war prisoners as places simply for inevitable death sentences . This concept of postwar justice is as cynical as " The Rainbow 's " belief that God belongs to the Russians , not to traitors or Nazis . As for Miss Smith 's statements that my criticism of the production of " The Rainbow " was " an insult to the Russian people , " " a treacherous attack on our Russian ally , " " a plea for a soft peace , " and that I " am impressed by the cruel-mindedness of the Russians " ? I am sure she has succeeded in insulting me . Among the things I am against are Nazism , a " soft " peace , the kind of peace advised in " The Rainbow , " and , most vehemently , against advising anybody to see " The Rainbow . "
