You one of those millions of Ameri- cans whose postwar backlog of unsatisfied demands includes some weeks or months of accumulated vacation ? Have you been promising yourself , for instance , that once your own reconversion problems were on the way to solution , you and your wife or your husband or your best friend or your Aunt Matilda would get a passport , pack a suitcase , and set out for one of those far-off places that have been barred to the casual traveler for nigh onto eight years ? If you have , then one of your first practical concerns must be to find out whether the country of your choice is willing and able to receive you , and how well . This is especially important if your goal lies anywhere in war-damaged Europe . Be assured , to begin with , that most European governments between us and the Oder want you to come if you can . Most of them were left , to put it very mildly , none too well off by the war ; they are in grave need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars spent inside their boundaries by American tourists ? " invisible exports " ? used to constitute a very large factor in their international trade balance . This is particularly true of France , whose economy was as thoroughly devastated by the war as that of any of our Allies , and which for years was the greatest single recipient of our tourist trade . The government of Francehopes , with all its official heart , that you will continue to be drawn irresistibly to Chartres cathedral and even to the Folies Bergere . It is making an intense effort to attract tourists ? particularly American tourists ? and to take the very best care of them that circumstances will permit . Just what will circumstances permit ? If you are considering the possibility of going to France this year , you may be wondering how much to believe of the most optimistic or the most pessimistic stories you hear about conditions there . If you have been especially impressed ? as , to their credit , so many Americans have been impressed ? by the pleas of relief agencies for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may visualize the country as one of such privations and shortages that each extra mouth to feed still means simply an extra burden . If , on the other hand , you have come into contact with ex-GI 's or officers who had an intimate knowledge of the French black market , or with American civilians whose recent errands in France have shown them only the most glittering side of the picture , you may think of the country as comparatively carefree , waiting only for you and your friends to come join in the fun . The truth lies nearer the first than the second of these two extremes . If you go to France this year , you will not eat food taken from some hungry child 's mouth ; but still less will you be just one among forty million gay revelers . You will get along . But now as always ? though now even more than usual ? the kind of time you will have depends upon yourself . TO BE MORE explicit , the kind of time you will have depends on your bank account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveler . If the first is fat or the second adventurous or the third rich , then by all means go to France this year if you have a mind to and can find a way to get there . But if you have neither wealth , nor the determination and hardihood of your pioneer ancestors , nor a pretty intimate knowledge of the country ( including , preferably , some acquaintance with its language ) , then stay in the Western Hemisphere this summer and leave your trip to France for later . A year or two from now it will probably run less risk of resulting in disillusionment either for yourself or for your hosts . This year , at least , it will be true for tourists as for the French themselves that the prizes will go to the darouillards ? that is , to those who are provided with an extra share of ingenuity in either the highest or the lowest sense . Ingenuity in the lowest sense may consist in knowing how to manipulate money ? or consumer goods ? in such a way as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not without risks . Its rewards , if it is practiced successfully , are material satisfactions , a tendency to gloating , and a degree of estrangement from the natives who sometimes feel that its devotees regard them simply as potential antagonists to be bested in a business deal . Ingenuity in a higher sense might be defined as the ability to choose , among a number of possible courses of action , the one that will afford the most satisfaction to the chooser . The more background he has of previous experience or native resourcefulness , the more this ability will be enhanced . To a great extent , money can be made to substitute for either kind of ingenuity , and a certain amount of it , to start with is clearly essential for practicing the lower type . This is not to imply that the wealthy tourist must enjoy his pleasures at the ex-MAGAZINE pense of decency or honesty . Though at this moment much of the wartime rationing system is still in force in France , and though rationing is supposed to have an equalizing effect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? even if there were no black market ? would be slight . The object of rationing as it is practiced in France now is to guarantee to each a minimum but not to hinder , in general , the free distribution of whatever luxuries and extras are available . It is more profitable to a depleted national treasury , for example , to tax fine wines heavily and allow them to be sold to the rich on a free market than to distribute them at controlled prices ? and lower taxes ? to rich and poor alike . Analogous situations exist in fields other than those of food and drink . So if you are among the financially fortunate , do n't think you will have to break any rules in order to enjoy the extras to which , before the war , your means would have entitled you . Minor details aside , you can still live in fabulous luxury on the Riviera just as legally as you can live in fabulous luxury in Palm Beach . The difference is that the Riviera is no longer the bargain it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for those whose purses are less well lined that the problems of vacationing in France become more complicated . And it is hard to give them information in advance about the general conditions they will find because , from many points of view , the phrase " general conditions " has very little meaning as applied ? to the France of today . If returning travelers tell you apparently contradictory stories about what they found there , it is not necessarily because they have been looking at the same picture from different angles ; it may be because , having visited different parts of the country , they have been looking at entirely different pictures . The statement that France was disrupted by the war means , among other things , that its central organization in almost every field was blown to bits . Traditionally France has been a country of far more administrative centralization than our own and probably more economic centralization . When the Germans arrived in 1940 they set out either to break up the nerve center controlling every phase of the country 's activity or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change it so as to make it a subsidiary of the Reich 's own economic and administrative setup . On top of the disruptions caused by the Germans came the disruptions caused by the resistance forces working against the Germans , and on top of both these came the disruptions caused by Allied bombings and the battle for liberation . Among the most severely harmed branches of the nation 's economy were its transport and communication systems . A railroad map of France in June 1944 looks as if someone had haphazardly scattered a few toothpicks across an outline drawing of the country . As revised two years later the same map shows , almost complete , the familiar spidery network of main arteries converging on Paris and subsidiary lines connecting smaller centers . The change represents a tremendous achievement ? a source of great pride both to the government and to the railway workers who performed it ? and it means that train traffic is nearly back to the prewar level . On the other hand , as a result of the war , greater demands are being made on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means just that much more freight to be hauled . So the effort must be concentrated as far as possible on essentials . This is one of the chief reasons ? there are others , perhaps less unavoidable , which are the subject of constant political bickering ? why commodities that are overabundant in some parts of the country are scarce in others . We can all remember , during the winter of 1944-1945 , reading stories of butter being burned to light houses in Normandy while in Paris it was selling on the black market at fantastic prices because so little of it could be transported to the city . It is safe to say that no such extreme regional differences in the state of supplies can be found in France today , but lesser ones are common . In naturally rich agricultural districts , for example , food is almost always plentiful and reasonably priced ; in regions less favored by nature it is apt to be scarce and expensive . Transportation and storage limitations also make for big differencesaccording to the time of year ; in Villon 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the poorer Parisians are likely to feed on a diet containing an unexcitingly large proportion of noodles . T ins does not mean that , wherever or whenever you travel in France this year , you will be reduced to eating noodles . You will always be certain of finding adequate fare at a price that will fit even a modest travel budget , though it will be more interesting at some times and places than at others . The war took an appallingly heavy toll of France 's national resources , and the only way to replace what has been destroyed at home is to import from abroad . But imports must be paid for in gold or foreign currencies . Reserves of gold have already been seriously depleted , and the only way to keep up the supply of foreign currencies is to export . So . for a long time to come , the greatest passible proportion of the national buying power abroad will be concentrated on heavy goods necessary for reconstruction and on supplies necessary to help home industries get on their feet again ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of what they produce . Such a program will hold down imports of nonessential consumer goods to the minimum considered politically feasible . Of course , since these goods are profitable to handle in the black market , unplanned quantities of them do leak in ; and special allotments of them are occasionally made to top-class establishments whose clients contribute heavily , in taxes , to the national treasury . But the stringent control of imports will explain why , in some places in France , you may sit down to an excellent dinner at a reasonable price but be unable to finish it off with real coffee ; or why , if you try to insist on orange juice for breakfast , you may find yourself thwarted at practically every turn . These , after all , are minor inconveniences . It is a rare orange juice fiend who can not be bought off with an offer of fresh peaches or strawberries or even , in winter , of an apple ; and if your happiness depends on being able to start your day with a cup of hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the instant variety for emergencies without raising objections from the customs officials . The same thing is true of what UNRRA early recognized as another of the three great moralebuilders ? soap , of which there is still a shortage in France . In the ease of the third -- cigarettes ? the situation is more complicated . At the beginning of 1947 , tobacco was still rationed , and the duty on imported cigarettes ( after the first carton of 200 , which each traveler could bring in free ) amounted to seventy-five cents per package . In the summer of 1946 a special tourist ration card had been issued which permitted men to buy twelve packs a month and women six ( far more than the French themselves were allowed ) . There were persistent rumors that tobacco would go off the ration list early in 1947 , and there were also rumors that , if it did n't , still more favorable measures would be taken to appease inveterate smokers among foreign tourists . If you smoke a great deal , the worst that can happen to you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your cigarettes at considerable expense or to buy them on the black market at even more expense . In either case the tobacco habit will probably cost you more than it has ever cost you before , but unless you chain-smoke from morning to night it will not cost you enough to make a serious dent in your travel budget . And there is a strong chance that by the time this article appears your problem will have been solved for you by an easing of restrictions . To make sure what the latest regulations are , it would be wise to inquire , shortly before you sail , of the nearest French consulate or of the French National Tourist Office in New York or Chicago or San Francisco , whose principal reason for existence is to advise prospective travelers on this and graver questions . III I F I HAVE dwelt so long on problems concerning the inner man , that is because it is ? or ought to be ? a fact well known to the medical profession that the heart can not expand as it should at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constricted by the pangs of hunger or thenerves are on edge for want of a cigarette . And then , too , for countless generations travelers in France have been trained to expect a liberal mixture of gastronomic pleasures along with their aesthetic delights . Whereas the average tourist may be resigned to eating underdone potatoes beneath the spires of Oxford , he thinks of Mont-Saint-Michel and Mother Pouiard 's omelettes in the same breath and with comparable degrees of anticipation . I hasten to add that he can still enjoy both ; the caprices of war have left the Mount intact and the chickens of this border land between Brittany and Normandy still lay enough eggs to satisfy local demands . But not all such happy combinations of food for the body and food for the spirit can be found in their prewar perfection ; and if both kinds of nourishment are important to you , then you had better check up in advance on the state of the restaurants as well as the state of the architecture in any particular region of France you may plan to visit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of bombings and wartime displacements , France is suffering from a housing shortage far more acute than our own , and many French people have been forced to live in hotels for lack of any other place to go . Therefore it is not safe to assume that , because the town you intend to visit has not itself suffered damage from the war , you will be able to find the kind of lodgings you want without arranging for them in advance . The town may be crammed full of residents who have had to move in from battered areas . If it is , you can still be pretty certain of finding a place to sleep , but it may not be the sort of place you would have selected if you had had a choice . That is , you can be pretty certain of finding shelter anywhere ? except , occasionally , in the large cities , where it is n't possible to get from the policeman on the corner the name of some old lady who might be persuaded to let you have her spare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some hotel accommodations to get a passport to Europe , and even on side trips , do n't let yourself be caught in any large city ? especially Paris ? without previous assurance of a place to lay your head . Luckily , it is now a simple matter to get up-to-date and fairly detailed information about the hotels and restaurants , as well as the museums and monuments , of the places you are likely to want to visit . Just as soon after the liberation as they could , the guidebook compilers began collecting material for revised editions . By 1946 the Club des sans-Club was ready with its first postwar edition of Les Auberges de France , a handbook which began appearing annually at Easter over twenty years ago and which gives realistic indications of the quality and ? as far as possible nowadays ? of the price of the food and lodgings in the numerous city , town , and roadside hostelries inspected , within the year , by club members . Designed primarily for motorists , it can be used with profit by any traveler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to France , of which a new edition appeared in 1946 with similar information about food and shelter for the tourist , though it is more reticent about even probable prices . The Michelin guide also gives information about the extent of war damage to architectural monuments and other places of interest . If you are driving your own car , you should supplement it with the latest versions of the renowned Michelin road maps , which show damage to highways and bridges and the extent of repairs already made , and , when possible , give some indication of the date when improvements may be expected . It would also be very useful , in planning a trip through any of the French provinces , to get hold of the proper folders from the series whose publication was started last year by the French National Tourist Office . These compact little leaflets seem to me to mark a distinct advance over the " Bask in Beautiful Brittany " type of thing we saw so often before the war . Illustrated chiefly by their eye-catching covers , they limit themselves ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the attractions of the province they describe , and devote the rest of their space to a clear four-color highway and railway map , a list of the principal points of interest with indications of war damages , and a series of four to six suggested itineraries for short or long trips through the region by automobile , by bus or train , or by a combination of the latter two . Some of them are already published in English , and they should soon be available at tourist agencies here as well as in France . As for guidebooks of a more general nature ? guidebooks that try to instruct and entertain as well as to inform on practical questions ? new editions have not yet begun to appear in quantity , though there may be a spate of them soon . ( Clara Laughlin and Fred Murray , for instance , are reported to be preparing new books on France ; and a new Michelin guide to Paris , already published in French , is expected to be ready in English shortly . ) Until the new travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical information by new handbooks and maps such as those described in the preceding paragraph , should be about as satisfactory as ever . ( Prewar books on Paris , happily , do n't need to be supplemented at all , except possibly by a map showing recent changes in street names ? changes made mostly to honor Allied war heroes or resistance martyrs ? for the city suffered little material damage during the war . ) IV O NCE you are informed about conditions in the places you want to visit in France , your only remaining problem is how to get to them . This one , as you might guess from the rapid rehabilitation of the railroads and the reappearance of guidebooks designed to help motorists , is the easiest of all . Once you are inside the country , you can get from any part of it to any other part with almost the same degree of comfort and convenience as before the war . Yes , the trains do run on time . They are almost as frequent as they were in 1938 , and already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the Golden Arrow and the Orient Express , are back in service . Pullmans are available for overnight journeys . Mainline trains are still apt to be crowded , though , so if you want to make sure of having a seat you had better reserve it in advance . If you are in a hurry you can travel between most of the main cities ( and between Paris and most other European capitals ) by air , though at the end of 1946 plane reservations were harder to get than railroad reservations . But Air France was expecting to put more planes into service soon and thus to increase the number of scheduled flights . Of course you can make the acquaintance of the French countryside better from the road than from a train or plane . If you want to take your own car , there is no reason why you should n't do it and be free to wander into whatever byways you like at whatever times you choose . The French government will allow you to bring the car into the country and keep it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a minimum of formalities , which can be arranged ( through the American Automobile Association or the American Automobile Touring Alliance ) before you leave home . The sale of gasoline is still controlled in France , but regulations are now so liberal that any tourist can , legally , get all he wants . With his special tourist ration card he can buy a certain amount at the basic " ration " price of 19 francs a liter . In March of this year the amount he was allowed to buy in Paris at this price was 50 liters ? a little under 13 gallons a week ; but if he intended to take a long trip ( to the Riviera , for instance ) he could apply for an extra ration ? at the reduced price ? for that . It is true that at current exchange rates the price even of " rationed " gasoline is considerably higher than in the United States , where the threat of 60-cent-agallon gas might easily close down the auto industry overnight . But gasoline has always been expensive in Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , luckily for you , distances are shorter in France than they are in the United States and that on a motor trip there you are likely to spend less time driving , and more time sightseeing , than you would on a motor trip at home . If you ca n't take your own car and still want to stick to the highway , then you can hire a car ? always an expensive luxury ? or , often , take a bus . Most interurban bus services in France , like all the railroads , are nationalized , and bus service in general is designed to supplement train service rather than to compete with it , though there are routes that are served by both trains and busses . Busses replace trains to special advantage in regions ? like parts of the Alps and of Brittany ? whose most beautiful scenery is inaccessible by rail . They have been slower than trains in reappearing since the war , but they are now back in respectable numbers . Among other special bus tours that will be arranged this season are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ INALLY , if your tastes run that way , you can ride a bicycle or just plain walk , taking trains and checking your bicycle ( if any ) to cover the longer stretches . Cycle and walking tours have always been more popular in Europe than in America ? partly because of the shorter distances ? and you will be able to get help in planning them , if you want it , from the same sort of camping clubs , youth hostel federations , and other sporting groups that offered their services before the war . Probably the best-known of these is the International Youth Hostel Federation , whose national branches in countries throughout the world have always welcomed each other 's members , whether they came as independent travelers or on guided tours . Last year American Youth Hostels , Inc. ( of Northfield , Massachusetts ) sponsored trips to France for three groups of students who spent part of their time sightseeing and part of it helping with reconstruction jobs ; this year it will sponsor more . Another similar project which one college girl of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French government , by a group called The Experiment in International Living , whose headquarters are at Putney , Vermont . The plan is to send a hundred or more qualified Americans to France to work as counselors in children 's summer camps . As in the Youth Hostel reconstruction tours , there will be time for sightseeing as well as for work , and those who make the trip will be expected to pay their own expenses ? estimated , in both cases , at somewhere around five hundred dollars . Trips like these are perhaps the most demanding form of travel , but in many ways the most rewarding . They used also to be among the least expensive , as the tourist who got around under his own muscle power was more likely than any other to wander off main-traveled roads into the byways where excellent food and comfortable though sometimes primitive lodgings could be had for a song . He can be less sure , nowadays , of the gastronomic bargains he used to find ; peasants who have experienced several years of a sellers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . There are many shining exceptions to the rule , but usually , if he travels on a modest budget , the tourist will have to be philosophical enough to content himself , more often than not , with modest fare . N O ONE can say exactly what terms like " modest prices " and " on the expensive side " are going to mean for American tourists in France in 1947 . It is easy enough to translate current French prices into dollars at current exchange rates , but both prices and exchange rates , in the present state of the French economy , are subject to considerable alteration within a short space of time . Among the many blessings which the German occupation brought to France was that of inflation . When the Allies entered Normandy , they thought it prudent to try to hold down the purchasing power of their own troops , and so the franc was arbitrarily set at an exchange rate which took this inflation only partially into account . At the end of 1945 the rate was drastically revised in a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dollar instead of 50 . This still left many prices in France high in American terms , and speculators ' opinions of what the franc was really worth were reflected in black market exchange rates , which were often twice as favorable to the dollar as the official scale . Meanwhile prices have continued to rise in France and there have been periodic rumors that the franc would be pegged still lower in relation to the dollar and pound . So of the two factors ? prices and exchange rates -- which will influence the cost of a trip to France this year for the American tourist , only the first is liable to change to his detriment ; the second , if it changes at all , will change in his favor . Of course the government will make every effort to keep prices down ( last January , most prices were ordered reduced by five per cent , and another such cut was made in March ) , and the more it succeeds in holding them in line , the less likely it is to try to lower the par @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general price rise is a gradual thing , which can hardly take him unawares and force him to cut short his vacation after he has already started out . All in all , if he plans his trip with reasonable care ( or lets some reputable travel agency do it for him ) , he runs little risk of unpleasant financial surprises on the way . One further word of reassurance . If the general price index in France is high , it is partly because of what an American would consider the inordinate cost of clothing and many types of durable goods . Neither of these items has to be included in a tourist 's budget ; if he ? or rather she ? goes out to buy clothes in Paris it is with the full knowledge that she is giving herself an expensive treat ; and it would be a rare traveler indeed who wanted to take home a meat grinder as a souvenir . Of the chief things the tourist does have to pay for ? food , lodging , and transportation ? only the first is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would in America , and at worst it will cost him more sometimes , not always or even often unless he deliberately holes up in a scarcity area and insists on eating as he would at home . This would be true even if , despite all efforts , prices should continue this year to rise as they have risen since the liberation . V T O co from the general to the specific , here 's the way our own vacation in France worked out last summer . We had a week free and decided we 'd go to Alsace ? not for any practical reason but just because I 'd never been there and my husband thought I 'd like the country as much as he did . The only plans we made consisted of buying a map of the region , deciding where we wanted to begin our tour , reserving seats on a train to the town we had selected as a starting point , and packing a few clothes ( and cigarettes ! ) in a knapsack that either of us ? theoreticallycould carry without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once that I never carried it . ) We traveled exactly as we pleased ? on foot through some of the loveliest parts of the Vosges , by bus or little local train when our objective was less to enjoy the country as we went than to reach some particularly picturesque town or village . We never arranged for shelter ahead of time but were never without a clean and decent place to sleep , though our lodgings ranged from a mountain farmhouse to a comfortable hotel in Colmar with excellent service and ? happy sign of returning normalcy ? steaming hot water running from the faucets . We were never hungry either , though there were times when we could n't get coffee for breakfast and there were villages where butter , milk , eggs , or sugar seemed completely lacking . On the other hand , the countryside , as opposed to these villages , had bountiful and delicious fare to offer within the limits of what could be raised locally , including quantities of the same dairy products that were sometimes unobtainable in a village ten miles away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kopfhus restaurants provided dinners that certainly could not have been surpassed before the war , the latter in a Renaissance mansion that would have been well worth a visit just as a museum . We made no attempt to keep a systematic expense account , but I did note some approximate figures for future reference . Our day at the farmhouse , for instance , cost us a shade over five dollars for two , including lodging , three meals with wine at one of them , and a copious lunch to take along when we set out down a mountain trail through the beautiful wooded slopes of the Vosges . At the other end of the financial scale , a day in Colmar stacked up something like this : two dollars and a half for a double room with hot and cold running water ( and hot baths , though we did n't have our own bathroom ) , five dollars for lunch for two , and about ten for the memorable dinner already referred to . We left Paris with about a hundreddollars between us ( plus two one-way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Express , with a comfortable amount of change in our pockets . We had not denied ourselves anything because of its cost , and we had made rather a point of trying out the local wines , which are notoriously excellent but not , nowadays , notoriously cheap . Even if the same trip should cost as much as fifty per cent more this year ( and there is probably small chance that it would cost that much more ) , I do n't think it could be considered expensive . M ONTHS later I read in a travel article a paragraph advising vacationers to stay away from Alsace for a while , as the dislocations caused by the war still made the tourist 's lot there too uncomfortable . I myself had thought I was having a wonderful time ; if I 'd been made momentarily uncomfortable by being caught in a shower five miles from the nearest town , it had n't occurred to me to blame the war . I concluded that the article had been written for people who travel in strictly orthodox fashion , weighted down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors to a special diet ) , and took it as one more reminder that the traveler 's point of view counts just as much as the surroundings he is traveling gyn . Of course the welcome he gets counts too . And it is not only officials behind desks in Paris who want to give him a warm one . There are plenty of others like M. Paillaret of Vienne , just below Lyon , whom we met when we spent a day in the town last September . Under the warm late-summer sun we explored the Roman amphitheater and some of the other Roman ruins , climbed to the hills overlooking the town and the swirling Rhone below , stopped for a contemplative cigarette in the jewel-like little cloister of St. Andre , and ended up in the hardware shop of M. Paillaret , to whom we had an introduction . Monsieur emerged from behind a wall of bottles and brushes , took off his spectacles , and lectured us for half an hour on the history of the town ? which , as the old capital of Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him how he thought next year 's crop of tourists would fare in Vienne , he told us about the efforts of the local Chamber of Commerce ( of which he is a member ) to make things comfortable and pleasant for them . " We know perfectly well that it 's to our interest , " he explained , with a mixture of local pride and concern for business that would have done honor to any Rotarian . Pointing to the fresh paint job on the big hotel at the end of the street , he cited it as an example of the way hotel and restaurant proprietors were refurbishing . Very soon now , he added , the Chamber would have its free information and guide service started up again . " And if they ask for help when there 's no one else available , I myself -- or the president of the Chamber ? will show them around the town . Do n't worry ; we 'll take good care of them . " If you can meet M. Paillaret and his kind half way , they will . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
