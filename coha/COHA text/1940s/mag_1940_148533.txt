A STRICKEN FIELD-Martha Gellhorn - Duell , Sloan and Pearce ( $2.50 ) . <P> Like her great &; good friend , Ernest Hemingway , Martha Gellhorn is a novelist with a legend . Unlike his , her legend is considerably greater than her published works , of which A Stricken Field is the second . <P> One day in 1934 Martha Gellhorn was introduced to FERA Administrator Harry Hopkins by a St. Louis newspaperman . <P> He recommended her for a job as relief investigator-at-large . She was not exactly what Harry Hopkins could call the right type . Her face was too beautiful , her blonde hair too expensive looking , her long legs too distracting , her clothes too Paris-perfect . He asked about her qualifications . She was 26 years old , had investigated conditions among textile work ers in France and England , had worked on a newspaper in Albany , N. Y. , for the United Press in Paris , for the New Republic - a mere fragment of her full story . <P> She got the job , came out of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories called The Trouble I 've Seen . It was acclaimed by Mrs. Roosevelt , by then ( 1936 ) well established as a leading U. S. book salesman ; and with Author Gellhorn 's photograph and back ground , any publisher 's publicity writer could do the rest . Martha was in . <P> St. Louis-born , restless daughter of a brilliant surgeon and one of St. Louis ' leading clubwomen , sent to Bryn Mawr ( " I was n't allowed to major in English on account of I was n't good enough and wrote rowdily . . . . " ) , Martha 's perambulations are such that only a good detective could have kept track of her . She has bummed her way afoot over most of Europe , making many an acquaintance on the way , once wrote a novel which she lost in Lake Maggiore , married and divorced famed French Journalist Count Bertrand de Jouvenel , accompanied a French youth delegation to Berlin , returned to the U. S. to roam in Mexico , the Texas oil fields , Hollywood . <P> In Spain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she watched the Nazi occupation . In January she returned from the Finnish front , as only accredited female war correspondent , with sufficient news for five current articles in Collier 's ; then headed for San Francisco de Paula , Cuba , where Ernest Hemingway is wintering. * <P> A Stricken Field is laid in Prague during the first days of the Nazi invasion of Sudetenland . It is the story of Mary Douglas , a U. S. foreign correspondent , how she got involved with anti-Nazi conspirators , her big failure when she enlisted the help of a British Special Commissioner and a French general in a scheme to protect her German Communist friend Rita . ( Rita , romanticized mistress of a romanticized revolutionist , is refugee heroine of Author Gellhorn 's story within a story-an artificial device , justified mainly by a climax scene which adds a graphic chapter to inquisitional literature. )
