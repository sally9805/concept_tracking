Up before the Foreign Relations Committee of the U.S. Senate last week was a treaty which would divide between Mexico and the U.S. the irrigation water of the Colorado River and the lower Rio Grande . <P> Seventy percent of the water in the lower Rio Grande originates in Mexico . She could dam up the tributaries , use the water on her own side of the border . But under the pending treaty Mexico agrees to give Texas approximately 800,000 acre-feet of water , keeping only about 600,000 acre-feet for herself . <P> In return , Mexico asks 1,500,000 acre-feet of Colorado River water , most of which originates in the U.S. <P> The treaty was sure to run into opposition in the U.S. Senate . California was bitterly opposed . Mexico 's share was only a small fraction of the Colorado 's water , but California farmers feared increased competition from Texas and Mexico . Much Mexican land on the lower Colorado was as productive ( if irrigated ) as California 's famed Imperial Valley . It might compete with California 's cotton and vegetable crop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than California to Eastern U.S. markets . California would like to stop that irrigation leak .
