Americans who entered Paris last week were amazed. * They had expected to find the Parisians starved , tattered , numb with oppression . Instead , the people looked about the same as they did before the Nazi occupation . The women had smart clothes and cosmetics , the children looked chubby and well-fed . There was plenty of beer and wine-even champagne . <P> Montparnasse 's three famed cafes-the Dome , the Rotonde , the Coupole-were doing business as usual under their striped awnings , although they closed during the street fighting . The supply of painted filles seemed ample to accommodate all soldiers interested in amour . In the Rue Scribe the American Express office still had its familiar big sign on the roof . The hotels were comfortably appointed , with plenty of linen and blankets , even satin quilts . <P> The Allies began last week to rush food supplies to Paris by air-but that was because the supply of food had been disrupted by the Allied advance and German withdrawal . There were no visible signs of severe , long-standing malnutrition . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resisters-had courted Paris as a moonstruck lout courts a handsome woman . Paris had smiled grimly and waited her chance to kick the lout in the derriere . Last week she did . <P> <P> *So amazed , and bemused , was one Australian correspondent that all he could do was cable his paper : " The whole thing is beyond words , " and sign his name .
