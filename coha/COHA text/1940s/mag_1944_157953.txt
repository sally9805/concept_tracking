Scoop <P> For spot news , U.S. radio now regularly scoops the press . At the Democratic Convention last week , CBS scored a notable scoop , not only on the press but on its airborne rivals . <P> Press and radiomen were told on Monday that Indiana Senator Samuel Jackson would read President Roosevelt 's long-awaited letter about Henry Wallace to them that night . The press took this in stride . So did all the networks except CBS . <P> From their fifth-floor headquarters in the Stevens Hotel , CBS engineers began to lay 600 feet of microphone cable . They had to work past NBC 's headquarters , past the rooms of other radiomen . Their rivals suspected nothing . The wire eventually reached the Democratic Committee room on the fourth floor . A microphone was attached to it and hidden in a black bag under a chair . The scoop was all set . <P> That night , as Senator Jackson prepared to read the President 's letter , CBS Announcer John ( " Charley " ) Daly popped the hidden mike out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " I want air " ) , and thrust it in front of the Senator . <P> While rival networkers boiled and newspapermen scribbled frantically away for future editions , CBS 's Midwestern listen ers got the news first-straight and hot from the Senator 's mouth .
