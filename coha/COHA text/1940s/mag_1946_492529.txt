How Women 's Clothes Get That Way By HAM B A BAIT ER w was Saturday morning . Crowds of bobby- soxers were rushing in and out of one of Chi- , cago 's largest specialty shops , entering in sweat-ers and skirts and departing in dresses . In front of the store , studying this phenomenon , was a stocky man , with alert dark eyes . It seemed that he could n't quite believe what he saw , for he stood there for several hours . Early in the afternoon a girl joined him . She was of the size and figure of a bobby-soxer , but was a bit older . Conversing in excited whispers , they headed for the junior-miss department . There the man asked to see some dresses for his companion . Managing to keep one eye on the dress-buying bobby-soxers , he carefully chose with the other a dozen of the numbers for which the youngsters were tossing aside their sweaters and skirts . His companion returned later with a friend . Each of the young ladies bought a dozen more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines . When they left the store they grinned at the man , who was still hovering about the entrance , his eyes popping as only the eyes of a dress manufacturer can pop at such a sight . By Monday morning the loot was spread over his New York office . The processes of creation were under way . Models buttoned and unbuttoned themselves in and out of dresses . A designer examined necklines and embroidery . The manufacturer was making up his mind which of the new dresses should be " knocked off " ? copied exactly  --  and which should be " adapted " ? made in the same style , but with minor changes here and there . Only a state of great emergency had sent the manufacturer on this dress-buying mission . Ordinarily he leaves such matters to one of his shoppers , who travel the country looking for hot-selling dresses . His gross had dropped since the Midwestern market had come out with this type of junior dress . When his shopper first sent him several of the dresses and reported that they were " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastern buyers . The buyers screamed they were too radical a departure from anything previously sold for juniors , and altogether pretty impossible . But close to twenty years in the dress business had taught him that one never knows . Since enthusiastic bulletins on customer acceptance kept coming into his office , there was nothing to do but get on a plane and go see for himself . No sooner had the manufacturer , who is highly respected in the trade for his ability to spot hot-selling dresses , put his dresses into production than all his competitors proceeded to knock off his knockoffs and adapt his adaptations . In no time the entire New York junior market was turning out the bobby-sox dress . From top to bottom , and in all branches , fashion is based on copying . Dresses are copied , suits are copied , coats are copied , hats are copied , shoes are get buyers hot things , so we pick them up out of town . If it 's early enough in the season , we reproduce the dress as near as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season , we adapt different features and combine them with features from other successful dresses . " A number of manufacturers have salesgirls in the large retail stores on their pay rolls . When ten dresses of a kind come in and eight go out the same day , the salesgirl calls her extracurricular boss . He immediately rushes an office girl over to buy the ninth dress . Buying dresses to copy is considered a routine matter in the trade . What is considered unfair , but done a great deal , is to sneak into a press preview of some top designer 's collection . Sidney Blauner , president of Lombardy , and a stickler for ethics , related proudly , " We do n't go to a single showing . We feel that 's unethical , and it 's our belief they do n't show what really is the stuff . But we do n't feel it 's unethical to go out in the stores and buy . " The lower-price houses have plenty of fancy company in the buying-tocopy business . According to the New - York Dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris models imported to this country was $280,000 . All but $30,000 of this merchandise came in in bond to be copied by the big-city custom dressmakers , and went out again to be sold out of the country . " The big-city custom dressmakers are the glamour people of the dress business , who sell in awe-inspiring salons simple little wool creations for $300 , and not so simple little evening creations for almost any price you want to name . Ladies with a surplus of cash and time come to them because they do n't want to meet themselves on the street . They have been known , however , to meet themselves at night clubs , the opening of the Metropolitan Opera , and like affairs . In the top wholesale field , Maurice Rentner , who makes dresses retailing from $70 to $300 , moans that the highprice-dress business is done . " We used to import original models from Paris , show them to buyers and take orders on copies of them . We made adaptations too . At that time , French stuff was copied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to Europe in 1925 and began copying models , too , the high-price business became a very sad business , indeed . " During the fall of 1945 , Nettie Rosenstein was being copied by manufacturers of women 's dresses from $4.75 up . She was most acutely distressed by the forty-to-fifty-dollar copies . Rosenstein originals start at $69.50 . At this price , dresses become " originals " or " models , " and a " line " becomes a " collection . " A few seasons ago Miss Rosenstein was also " hot " in the misses ' field . At that time her entire collection was offered to buyers by a manufacturer of misses ' dresses in the price bracket just below hers . The knock-offs were shown simultaneously with the first showing of the Rosenstein collection . Obviously , they were not ethical knock-offs , reproduced from Rosenstein numbers bought in retail stores . They appeared too soon . It looked like a leak in her workroom , and so a buyer informed her of the situation . Investigation convinced Miss Rosenstein that someone was giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norman Norell , of Traina-Norell$49.50 to $210 wholesale  --  was the " hottest " designer in the misses ' field during the fall of 1945 . He goes in for youthful things , severely simple , with almost no drapery . Several of his best numbers , shown in August , were in popular and moderate price misses ' lines by October . Among these was the much-copied jersey dress with the gathered skirt , tight midriff and high round collar . Norell made this dress to retail for about $110 . Adaptations were retailing for as little as $12.50 . One of the strangest inconsistencies of the dress business is the feeling that it 's all right to copy , but all wrong to-be copied From time to time , manufacturers try to stop copies of their dresses by refusing to sell to a store that buys from a manufacturer they know is knocking them off . Since the bigger profit to the retail store is in the higher-price garment , the maneuver is usually temporarily successful . Hollywood and the offerings of the motion-picture designers like Adrian , Irene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular and moderate price lines . ( Continued from Page 46 ) Other standard sources of inspiration are fashion magazines , American and French . The latter , as well as sketches of Paris models , somehow managed to get into designing rooms up and down 7th Avenue  --  main street of the New York garment district , where 80 per cent of the nation 's street dresses are made  --  all during the war . A fashion clipping service furnishes the trade with dress advertisements from newspapers all over the country . A fashion-note service describes in detail the latest sleeves , necklines , and so forth , from Hollywood , Paris and points between . And manufacturers buy sketches from model makers  --  freelance designers  --  who , in turn , have been combing all these same sources  --  to supplement the efforts of their own designers . But in the midst of this mad scramble for ideas , every popular and moderate price house has one or two numbers that go on selling year after year with practically no changes . They are called " runners . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,000,000 dresses of one style  --  a two-piece peplum affair with a half sash , inserted at the side seams and tying in front . And it 's just as good today as it ever was . Another runner that 's been going strong for five years is a two-piece number with a high neckline that buttons down one side of the front like a Chinese mandarin coat . A ferocious C hinese dragon is appliqu  --  d on the center front . The manufacturer of this dress makes it in light-colored cotton . It retails for around ten dollars . In the fall of 1945 , Anthony Blotto showed a similar dress in his collection , in black wool . But instead of the Chinese dragon in the center front , Blotta 's dress was decorated with a huge Russian emblem embroidered in gold . It retailed for $155 . The September first Vogue carried a picture of Blotta 's dress . The ten-dollar man saw it . At first he was pleased . He opened the Vogue with a great flourish , pointed to the dress , then to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See , he knocked us off ! " Actually , the dress was an adaptation . There had been some changes made . The ten-dollar man 's attitude of passive pride lasted about a week . Then he could contain himself no longer . He had to complete the circle . He had his designer make up a wool version of his cotton mandarin dress , on which he substituted for the appliqued Chinese dragon a Russian emblem embroidered ' in gold and sprinkled with sequins . Of the sequins his designer observed , " That 's because our embroidery 's not so good . " His dress was an adaptation too . He decided a white top with the black skirt would be " classier " than Blotta 's all black . He made a change . The new dress went to the cost department to be figured . When the report came back , the manufacturer was heartbroken . " I could make it for sixteen seventy-five , but I just ca n't do it for ten seventy-five . It 's the embroidery , " he said sadly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one gets out of line on the merry-go-round of adapting and readapting , and blossoms out with too many original ideas , the retail stores act as censors on the designer 's efforts . As Dorothy Shaver , president of Lord &; Taylor , puts it , " The greatest single influence on American fashions is a few smart retail shops . We edit the fashions for American women . " Editing the fashions affects mainly the name designers . They are the people who establish what are called in fashion circles , " the trends " ? the silhouettes of the season . Should these designers happen to show too many trends in a collection , the fashion-editing retail shops would pick out one or two and push them . The others would be junked . Too many different trends given equal play in a season would result in such confusion women might just stick to their last year 's dresses . The " Edwardian influence " in the fall of 1944 was a Lord &; Taylor edited trend . " We saw one little cape dress in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reig , $39.50 and up , wholesale  --  and thought it was wonderful , " Miss Shaver said . " We told him to make up eight or ten models in dresses and suits , and we dubbed it the ' Edwardian influence ' and promoted it . That started the wee-shoulder-cape trend . " Other manufacturers saw Lord &; Taylor 's advertisements and jumped in with more wee shoulder capes , short capes and cape sleeves , and the " Edwardian influence " swept the country . Actually , these " few smart retail shops " are the mysterious " they " of the oft-quoted phrase , " They are wearing black and brown this season . " or " They are wearing feathers in their ears . " It 's the retail stores that have ruled navy out as a fall color and have placed women who want to wear navy all year round in the silly position of having to buy their dresses and accessories in the spring or do without . Occasionally , ideas come from custom dressmakers like Mainbocher and Valentina , and the " custom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most exclusive specialty shops . Purchases in these inner sanctums of the dress world are more difficult to make . For these purchases , manufacturers depend on ladies long on fashion and social background , and short on cash . These obliging ladies buy the dresses and let the manufacturers copy them for a fee . On the whole , the offerings of the custom designers are too intricately cut to he useful to the trade , particularly the lower-price lines , where a worker is strictly a machine operator . Popular and moderate price dresses are not basted together first . They 're sewn from scratch on a machine that pinks the seams as it sews . Stitches are long and the whole operation is extremely rapid . A shop with forty machines  --  the average size  --  can make 500 dresses a day . Higher-price dresses are basted first . Seams are larger , hems are deeper , and the finishing is done by hand . A few of the very best manufacturers , $49.50 to $210 wholesale , make a dress almost as painstakingly as a custom dressmaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called in fashion lingo , is useful to the trade for trimming and embroidery ideas . But dress manufacturers do n't have to worry about copying these . That 's taken care of for them by manufacturers of belts , trimmings , pins , buttons , and by the embroidery houses . As the girl in charge of the trimming department at Lombardy announced casually , " Just as fast as something new comes out , the trimming salesmen are in here with it . " The dress business is just chock-full of psychology . In designing , there 's the psychology of figuring out when women are ready to accept what silhouette . There are , after ail , only a few  --  long skirts and short skirts , small waists and full skirts , and the pencil-slim effect . One usually follows the other . When is called , in the trade , " timing , " and is a matter of great importance to designers who set the trends . The current small-waisted silhouette was first launched in 1939 by Mainbocher in his Paris house . He went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear which exaggerated the small-waisted , full-hipped effect . But in 1939 , with a war in the offing , women 's thoughts turned to practical things , and the idea flopped . In ' 1944 , Norell picked it up . By 1945 , when the war ended , his corselette dress  --  which , with American women in mind , has the corset effect without the corset  --  is one of the year 's most-copied numbers . In the selling end of the business , from the haute couture down , good old psychology rears its head even higher . Ladies who buy custom-made clothes want to be impressed , and you can hardly blame them . When the little woman pays $300 and up for a dress , she 's entitled to a show thrown in . Custom salons are ultra-impressive . They are deeply carpeted in gray or beige . They have lots of mirrors , and they go in for crystal chandeliers in a big way . The show starts at three P.M. Ladies who have been lunching at the Colony begin to drift in at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the afternoon . They see a parade of tall , thin , curveless mannequins , wearing models from the custom designer 's collection . A few painfully poised salesgirls  --  only in this bracket they are n't salesgirls , they 're vendeuses  --  hover about to pick up anything madame might drop , and to grab madame , in a most dignified manner , of course , and rush her to a fitting room after the show , if it looks as though she 's a live one . Everything is hushed , social and poisonously refined . At Mainbocher 's , a butler in full afternoon regalia , including tails and a white tie , passes around glasses of ice water . Mannequins have not the vaguest notion of the price of the dresses they show . One is made to feel that to reduce Mainbocher 's art to mere dollars and cents is definitely common . Valentina , whose establishment and collection is much smaller , has no regular mannequins or uendeuses . She 's the combination mannequin-vendeuse . This precludes daily showings . However , what her place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valentina shows by appointment , and great care is taken that the departing customer does n't bump into the arriving one . Often her customers ' unsophisticated preferences not only annoy but amaze Valentina . Modeling a black satin number in her fall , 1945 , collection , she announced , " This is for women who insist on looking pretty . Some women do , you know . " One gathers that Madame Valentina thinks it strange for a woman to want to look pretty . She is fond of doing whimsical little things . Once she appeared at Club 21 with a jewel  --  a real one  --  in the center of her forehead , suspended from a ribbon tied in her hair . This threw all the lesser lights in the place , including the waiters , into a panic . They took to holding forks to their foreheads and grimacing in caricature of Madame Valentina . " It was embarrassing , " Valentina 's husband , George Scbdee , who handles the crass commercial side of the house of Valentina , observed . But Valentina won the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Schlee fondly refers to Valentina 's most lucrative customers as " her girls " ) and had them wear jewels on their foreheads at the opening of the Metropolitan . It was terrific , " Schlee said . " A fashion was launched ! " The jewels were real . Schlee has become hardened to scenes running from the embarrassing to the terrific . They have been part and parcel of Madame Valentina 's rise to fame . She began her activities as a walking advertisement in the mid-20 's , shortly after her arrival in New York from the other side . At that time " they " were wearing tight skirts that ended at the knee . Madame Valentina chose to wear full skirts that ended at the floor . Thus garbed , she would appear at opening nights and in those cafes where being seen takes precedence over being fed . It was frightening to go with her , " Schlee recalled . " She 'd get a little ahead of me walking down the aisle and I 'd hear ' Look at that crazy woman ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However amazing Madame Valentina 's dramatic entrances may still seem to the unknowing , twenty years have nurtured a circle of knowing . These parties view them with breathless reverence . One of the most original custom dressmakers is Charles James . He dresses a small but extremely exclusive clientele , consisting of such oddly assorted personages as Mrs. Eleanor M. ( Cissie ) Patterson , publisher of the Washington Times-Herald , Mrs. Harrison Williams , for years voted one of the ten best-dressed women in the world , and Gypsy Rose Lee , the striptease artist . James ' collection consists of around a dozen numbers , These he has designed over a period of ten years . He never discards anything . Ten years from now , the earns numbers will be in his collection , with four or five new " problems " he will work out over the course of years . Psychology , in the mass-production field , takes a different twist . Lombardy , the largest manufacturer in the country , has the smallest , most unimpressive showroom . This is geared to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving them better dresses for the money . But even here the dramatic is n't entirely overlooked . Lombardy has a cat  --  an aristocratic Siamese . Her name is Loady . Her accouterment  --  a large paper-filled box , a plate of liver and lungs and a spacious drinking fountain  --  occupies a conspicuous corner of the showroom . Buyers who carelessly mistake Loady 's drinking fountain for a cuspidor are severely reprimanded . Nor are Lombardy 's customers little brown hens . Although they pay only seven to seventeen dollars for their dresses , they , too , have a touch of the theatrical in their make-ups . It 's Lombardy 's boast that wherever you see Frank Sinatra you see a Lombardy dress , " on the girl who 's planting the lipstick right smack on his cheek . "
