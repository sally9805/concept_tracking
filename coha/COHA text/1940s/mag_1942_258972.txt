Day before Franklin Roosevelt gave new and sweeping powers to War Manpower Commissioner Paul Vories McNutt ( TIME , Dec. 14 ) he went over the final draft of the order with a group which included McNutt , War Secretary Henry L. Stimson , Navy Secretary Frank Knox , and WPBoss Donald Nelson . When the President came to the section stopping all enlistments in the armed forces , Secretary Knox is said to have begged : <P> " Paul , give me just three more months for naval enlistments . " <P> And McNutt replied : " Frank , when the President signs that order , I wo n't give you three minutes . " <P> As his first act on receiving his new power Paul McNutt conferred with the joint Chiefs of Staff to determine the basic military needs for 1943 . As boss of all manpower , Paul McNutt well knew that military needs come first . But with an eye on the manpower pool for war production , he also needed justification from the Army and Navy of their needs . <P> From global-minded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , came justification for a 7,500,000-man Army in 1943 . Best WMC estimate now is that the total armed forces will require 9,700,000 men by the end of next year . Best WMC estimate for a total labor force for 1943 is 65,000,000 . But , excluding unemployables and women with young children , there are only 60,000,000 men &; women in the U.S. between the ages of 14 and 60 who might be able to work or fight . <P> Faced with such a 1943 squeeze , Paul McNutt will have to do some fancy juggling , make some tough decisions . Two facts affecting all the people emerged : dependency will soon be out as the sole reason for military deferment , many more women will have to go to work in war industry-perhaps enough to boost the total from the present 4,000,000 to 20,000,000 . <P> Last week Paul McNutt took his most drastic step to date in ordering some 600,000 workers in 34 categories in the Detroit area " frozen " in their jobs . The order does not force any person to stay at his present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for wanting to change . In the works were similar freezings of 110,000 merchant seamen , 1,500,000 West Coast aircraft workers , and thousands of Southwestern railroad track workers . But these are only samples of what must still come .
