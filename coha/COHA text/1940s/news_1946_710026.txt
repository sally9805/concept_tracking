txt Fine words to the contrary , it needs to be understood that the new 27-to-5 United Nations resolution does nothing important to ease the suffocating abuse of the Security Council veto . The resolution was supported by all the countries which want to reform the Security Council veto ; it was opposed by all the countries ? the Soviet bloc  --  which want to preserve the Security Council veto untouched and untouchable . The resolution is , in effect . the small nations ' appeal and the big nations ' hope that Russia will not use so frequently the tremendous blocking power which the veto ' gives each of the Big Five . It " earnestly requests " the permanent members of the Security Council to insure that the use of its special voting privileges " does not hinder nor obstruct the Security Council in carrying ' its solemn obligations in respect to the peaceful settlement of disputes . " Of course , no harm can come from this innocent resolution unless it is allowed to give the impression that something solid : . as been accomplished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voting privileges . with which this resolution- is concerned are unrelated to the recent agreement in principle that there ; hall be no veto over the " day-to-day operation " of inspection of possible disarmament and atomic-ener6 controls . This would have been an extension of the veto , and what the General Assembly wants is not more veto but less veto . But this latest " earnest appeal " does not go beyond the original pledge of restraint which the Big Five made at San Francisco when they gave one another power singly to block the Security Council at every important turn . It was then they vowed that never , never would any of them even think of using the veto power " willfully to obstruct the operation of the Council . " It has been so used over and over again  --  so often that the overwhelming majority of the members of the United Nations have begun to talk about the need of amending the Charter , and have got as far as asking the five possessors of the veto  --  but primarily Russia  --  to use a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far , no headway at all has been made toward muting the Security Council veto , and it is important to try to find the reason . Having watched the Charter being put together from the cellar up in San Francisco , I am inclined to this judgment : It is impossible ? certainly very improbable ? that any. - thing significant can be done to effect a Charter reform without touching the Charter itself . Thus far none of the big powers , which would like to restrict the veto in practice , and few of the small powers , which would like eventually to amend the Charter as soon as ? ? ? ? 1110187millear A s.nttated PrPzot Emblem of United Nations possible , have proposed amendments at this time . The veto represents a big-power authority imbedded deep into the Charter , and no formula of words which only urges that that right be used more sparingly , but permits the right to be retained unsparingly , is likely to get anywhere . If words outside the Charter would accomplish that- reform , they would have done so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right words not ' ' to use their veto power willfully to obstruct the operation of the Council . " Since . the veto is a Charter-provided right , there is little reason to expect that its use is going to be curtailed by a nonbinding extra-Charter inhibition which has no power to inhibit . A A A This suggests that these ultra-Charter resolutions are just so much window dressing , and tend to defer constructive reform ' rather than promote it . It suggests that the only way to curtail the use of the veto is to curtail the power of the veto . At present , any one of the Big Five can prevent the Security Council from : ( 1 ) Determining the existence of a threat to the peace ; ( 2 ) investigating a dispute or situation which threatens the peace ; ( 3 ) ? making proposals for the pacific settlement of a dispute ; ( 4 ) using force to back up its proposals if necessary . The United States , Great Britain , France , and China have announced that they favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the time to attempt to amend the Charter is not just yet . It is difficult to escape the conclusion that there is no way to reform the veto without reforming the Charter itself .
