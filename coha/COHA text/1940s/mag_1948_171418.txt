Without U.N . swords to back the plan which the General Assembly had penned , Palestine partition would fail . Last week the harassed U.N . Palestine Commission publicly acknowledged that steely fact . <P> Since the Assembly approved partition Nov. 29 , not one major step had been taken to realize the plan . Washington , whose backing had helped win U.N . approval for partition , was now reluctant to support it ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) . The Arabs , who have stridently defied the U.N . plan ever since it was voted , last week repeated a familiar boast . Said the Arab Higher Committee for Palestine ( which speaks for the ex-Mufti of Jerusalem ) : Palestine Arabs will " never submit or yield to any power going to Palestine to enforce partition . " <P> Unsatisfactory . British troops still stood guard on the streets and rooftops of the Holy Land ( though last week the first troops , some 300 , were withdrawn ) . But the U.N . commission was not getting much British cooperation . In a series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain had refused : <P> To open up a port for Jewish immigration , beginning Feb. 1 , as U.N . had recommended . <P> To permit organization of a Jewish militia to defend the new Jewish state . <P> To welcome the commission to Palestine before May 1 , only a fortnight before it is supposed to assume responsibility for administering partition . <P> The commission talked back . Britain 's warning that commissioners could not be protected if they came before May 1 , it said , was " not satisfactory . " Chairman Karel Lisicky , of Czechoslovakia , was considerably more explicit : " Britain is responsible for law and order so long as the mandatory regime is there . If we come in before May 15 when the mandate ends , they are directly responsible for our safety . " <P> Unseasonable . " We have no ambition to be either heroes or martyrs for the United Nations , " added Lisicky . The commission appealed to the Security Council to provide an armed force . ( The Security Council , as such , has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week , with only 96 more to Partition Day , the Security Council began discussions . There was no saying how long discussions would take . In Damascus , Arabs hinted that they would strike while U.N . was still talking , and along Palestine 's coastal plain , Jewish citrus exporters saw confirming activity : Arab growers were unseasonably shipping out oranges of a type which will not ripen until April .
