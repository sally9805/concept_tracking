For 17 years , the Federal Reserve Board 's index has been the authoritative barometer of U.S. industrial production . In peacetime , many a U.S. businessman eagerly scanned the index 's monthly rise-or fall-shifted his financial position accordingly . Many a financial house bases its carefully computed private index on that of FRB . Last week , FRB admitted , with tremendous dignity , that for two years its index has been inaccurate . <P> FRB had a simple explanation . Skyrocketing war production knocked peacetime measuring sticks into the statistical ashcan . Example : the chemical industry . In peacetime , chemical production weighs little in FRB 's scales . Thus , when the industry mushroomed under astronomical orders for explosives , the FRB index failed to show it . To rectify this , FRB boosted the statistical importance of this industry , added some 20 others to the index and found new yardsticks , e.g. , in the converted rubber industry , man-hours worked replaced the former measure of activity-rubber consumption . All this forced FRB to boost the index 36 points to 243 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 1 ) U.S. industrial volume is 2.4 times , instead of merely twice , that of peace years ; 2 ) more than 70% of U.S. industrial production , instead of some 65% , is in war goods . ( This was a shocker to some experts who had figured the civilian rock-bottom as 35% of all production . ) <P> When the index was given its last major overhauling , in the campaign year of 1940 , there were cries from many a bigwig statistician , including Cleveland 's Brigadier General Leonard P. Ayres , that the updating was for political purposes . This time , outside of the necessary slide-rule juggling to bring related indexes into line , there was no commotion . Most businessmen , ear-deep in war work , now have only an academic regard for FRB 's index . They gauge their business prospects by the communiqus.
