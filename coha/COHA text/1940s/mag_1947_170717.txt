Posters spotted the kiosks and bill boards of Buenos Aires . " Do n't buy La Prensa ! " they shrilled . " Do n't advertise in La Prensa , the No. 1 enemy of the news vendors and workers in general . " The posters bore the imprint of the Argentine Ministry of Information . <P> Once again Juan Peron was sharpening his ax for the stately , 77-year-old royal oak of Latin American journalism . He had an old score to settle . In October 1945 , just before Peron 's two-day fall from power , La Prensa had thundered that the Government should be turned over to the Supreme Court . Furious , Juan Peron had replied : " I shall not permit La Prensa to shout the Government down . " He has never forgotten . It would have been hard to forget , for La Prensa has been the oak around which much of Peron 's opposition has rallied , perhaps without a full realization that it is in the midst of social revolution . <P> Pinprick Campaign . Last fortnight , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies : the " oligarchy , " Opposition politicians , Communists - and La Prensa . Next day the News Vendors ' Union , newly organized and recognized by Pern 's Labor Ministry , demanded that the paper stop delivering copies straight to subscribers . Home deliveries account for less than a tenth of La Prensa 's 387,384 circulation , but to have cut them off would have thrown 250 employees out of work and cost $400,000 in severance pay . <P> Last week a Peronista deputy introduced a bill prohibiting the sale of any article at less than its production cost . <P> That too was aimed at La Prensa , whose , ads alone make possible its 2 sale price . <P> Of all Latin American newspapers , La Prensa is about the hardest to coerce . It regularly prints more classified ads than any paper anywhere - an average of six pages a day , all bought in cash across the counter before publication . Display ads get the back pages . Thus , up to a point , La Prensa can tell industry and commerce as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1930 , when Dictator Jos Uriburu threatened to close La Prensa unless it stopped attacking him , the paper 's tough old owner and publisher , Ezequiel Pedro Paz , told him that he would move the paper to Paris and keep up the fight from there . General Uriburu piped down . That was 16 years ago , and Don Ezequiel , paralyzed by a stroke in 1943 , has never known that his paper was closed for five days in April 1944 , for opposing the militarist Farrell regime . <P> Muffled Thunder . Today La Prensa is not the paper it used to be . In the face of Peron , it has muffled its thunder . Its voice has become more &; more the voice of the oldtime Jockey Club oligarchy , an echo of the dead past in the very much alive present . <P> Nevertheless , La Prensa is still a formidable institution . Foreign governments implicitly accept its news . Reporters work gladly in its clublike editorial rooms for less than they could get elsewhere . Its circulation paces the field in Latin America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a million and a half a year . <P> Last week La Prensa , though no longer the oldtime thunderer for constitutional liberties , still had voice to answer the latest Pern attack :
