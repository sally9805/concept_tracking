Pala TWO A LI . young professionol men are divided into D. two classes  --  those who know how 10 charge and those who do n't . Clark Sellers , Los Angeles document examiner , starved away at his profeettion for six years before he learned to get his fees up to eubsistence level , It took a wheat farmer to enlighten him . Sellers was called to a small community in 1022 to investigate poison-pen letters which had been received by the witent farmer and by a young woman of excellent reputation . The local prosecutor had a long list of suspects . It contained the names of everybody in the vicinity who had on uncertain temper , a muddy complexion , a squint , a poor record for church attendance or a habit of talking to himself . Everybody who was suspiciously guy or suspiciously morose was on the list . There is never any dearth of suspects in a poison-pen case . Sellers examined samples of the handwriting of everybody on llw list and exonerated them all . The only thing left was to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might involve the study of hundreds of specimens of penmanship , and the prosecutor said the county could n't stand the expense . " I want to get at the bottom of this , " said the wheat farmer . He wrote a check for $500 and tossed it to Sellers . " And when you 've worked that out , " he added , " there 's plenty more where it came from . " Sellers was then twenty-nine years old . It was the first time he had been inoculated with a good round sum . He photographed the check before he deposited it . He planned to hang the picture on the wall for moral effect on other clients . He went furiously to work on the case , Fresh batches of handwriting samples came from the prosecutor every day . They were all exasperatingly innocent . The $500 check gave Sellers an invincible confidence in his own ability , and he resolved to clear up the case if he had to examine all the handwriting on the Pacific Coast . Whenever he was in low spirits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! nit new life in him . One day when he wins fortifying his ego by a Iong look at it , Is. suddenly became rigid with attention . He could hardly believe his eyes . The writing had come to life and practically jumped out of the picture . The case was solved . Thu man who wrote the $500 check was unmistakably the man who wrote the poison-pen letters . The wheat farmer 's object was matrimony . The poison-pen letters were love-making devices . The farmer had been carried away liy lender emotion when accidentally thrown into the girl 's society on a picnic , but he found himself tongue-Lied in tier presence . He could n't compete wit h fellows who rattled off bright remarks and made everybody laugh . A serious atmosphere was necessary to his success as a conversationalist . He wrote the poison-pen letters to provide a constant supply of gloomy topics . As he and the girl were the only recipients of the letters , he laid the foundation for somber tote-a-tkes that were made to order for his conversational style . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a perfect topic for him . Impending doom was right in his line . His later letters accused her of being a painted Jezebel . By his unaided colloquial powers ii would have taken him a thousand years to lead up to the electrifying subject of sex . By the poison-pen met hod he W9-9 able to place it squarely on the agenda in their most intimate conferences , His technique was crowned with success . He was engaged to the girl before Sellers made hie startling discovery . After proof of his guilt had been laid before him , the wheat farmer took the position that , since he had financed the investigation , he owned a controlling interest in it , and it came under the head of private enterprise . He cheerfully paid till incidental expenses , and the prosecutor dropped the matter . But a postal inspector , who had been independently PHOTOGRAPHY BY CENE LESTER working up a case against the farmer , was not to easily satisfied.:Plie wheat raiser was indicted under a Federal statute . There was no prosecution , however . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its chief witness . According to relief &; accounts , the marriage was an uncommonly happy one . Sellers was astonished by the whole affair . Poison-pen psychology was new to him . He learned later that it was not unusual for a poison-pen writer to send envenomed letters to himself and then take the foremost place in the hue and cry after suspects . The love motive was odd , but experience taught Sellers that the motives of anonymous-letter and poison-pen authors cover a wide range . He had one case where the motive was to break a lease , a landlady having dipped her pen in cyanide in order to run a tenant out of town , so that she could rent her property at a higher figure . In another case the motive was ambition , a young fellow having written terror letters in order to startle executives into recognizing his merit . The terror letters were turned over to Sellers by some very agitated oilmen . The first communication bore simply the printed words BEWARE BEWARE , which had been clipped out of a newspaper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ink , stated that destiny would strike the company at eleven A.M. on Thursday after next . Other letters emphasized the day and hour of the impending catastrophe . The oilmen furnished Sellers with a long and promising list of people who seemed logical contenders for the honor of blowing up the oil company . Sellers absolved them all . On Thursday an oil official called up Sellers and told him to drop the case , as it had solved itself . Shortly before the fateful hour of eleven , a young fellow had made his way through an army of detectives by proving that he had an appointment . He greeted t he president of the company with a fit of infectious laughter and asked , " Did you get my BEWARE BEWARE letters ' ? " The president joined feebly in the merriment and then began to question the visitor . It turned out that the young fellow had been taking a course in the psychology of vaulting to the top of the ladder instead of sneaking up one rung at a time . He had been taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They could not maintain t hal policy WARE formula in order to etch himself indelibly on against a chap with a grand-slam , jack-pot-hit ling personality . The success course had stressed the value of making on unforgettable first impression . The young fellow had invented the BEWARE the corporation 's brain . But the president said the oil company was too small for him . " Try General Motors , " he advised . Sellers ' findings in the case of the wheat farmer embarrassed his patron to an unusual extent . It is not unusual , however , for his findings to come under the heading of bad news to his client . He testified in a trial at Salinas , California , recently that approximately 40 per cent of his opinions were adverse to the parties who employed him . One of the first important documents that he examined when he ? first opened his office at Los Angeles was a will disposing of a $10,000,000 estate . A lawyer asked Sellers to study it for evidence of fraud , saying that there was lots of money in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The expert could find nothing wrong with the document , and the proposed will contest was dropped . Another of his early Los Angeles clients hoped to prove that the will of Rudolph Valentino was a forgery , but the expert could discover no flaw in the document . Sellers scandalized the celebrated Aimee Semple McPherson and her lawyer by giving them one of his adverse opinions . The Los Angeles prosecutor was working up a case against Aimee after her world-famous vanishing act . Between her disappearance on the beach at Santa Monica and her reappearance in the desert in Arizonu , her faithful adherents had been induced to contribute to a memorial for her . On her reappearance , the evangelist said that she had been kidnaped and kept in ignorance of the money-raising campaign . The authorities alleged that the whole thing was a conspiracy to defraud ; that , while purporting to be in heaven , she was actually hiding out in a romance-haunted bungalow at Carmel and supervising the drive for funds . Investigators found two grocery lists on a shelf at the Carmel bungalow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She made it furious denial . Her lawyer wanted an expert to corroborate Aimee . He engaged Sellers , who had recently come to Los Angeles . At the expert 's request , the evangelist wrote some samples of her penmanship in his presence . Sellers compared these with the writing on 35 I lie grocery lists and rendered an opinion that the grocery Hate were unmistakably in Aimee 's hand-writ iiig . The lawyer was dumfounded . He gave the young expert to understand that . he was a mighty poor 1.1 ( Calsu for an expert . When t he came won placed before fl grand jury , the grocery lists disappeared in the grail-jury room . They were never found , and , wit li I he evaporation of the main evidence , the ease colloipK4 ? ( 1 . In one of his early Los Angeles cases , a lawyer refused to pity Sellers because his opinion was adverse . " Why should I pay you ? " demanded the lawyer . " You have rendered no services . You have rendered nothing but disservice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal profession frequently seems to be about equally interested in building up and tearing down experts . The expert . is often an illustrious scientist when he testifies for the lawyer ; a mere comic-opera character when he testifies against him . The late Max D. Steuer , New York legal star , once neglected to get an opinion in advance from his own expert , and the expert testified against him . Max won the case by boundless ridicule of all experts , claiming that their opinions were such a joke that he never cared whether they testified for or against him . But in other cases Max treated experts on his side as if they were Einateins or Aristotles . One NeW York Federal judge said from the bench that " experts are a dime a dozen , " but immediately afterward characterized a witness as one of the greatest living authorities on his subject . Laymen are naturally confused and much addicted to the belief that all expert testimony is on the market for the highest bidder . Document examiners are in a different class from other experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they often deal with doubtful problems . There is , for example , still a big controversy , after 345 years , as to whether Hamlet was mad or just nervous . Honest real-estate experts can differ enormously in their guesses as to the probable future value of a piece of property . Los Angeles and some other cities have grown so fast that the wild exaggerations of " hired liars " soon became understatements . The document examiner is not called on to speculate on baffling symptoms or to foretell the growth of cities . He deals with the question : " Is this genuine or a forgery ? " The physical facts generally give t he a nswer almost to a mathematical certainty . There is seldom room for honest disagreement among competent specialist in this field . John Harris , a Los Angeles expert . testified that , to the best of his knowledge , his opinion When thivkness of paper is a clue , Sellers uses a miernmeter accurate to 1/10,000 of an inch . had never been in conflict with that of Sellers . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it was the late Albert S. Osborn , of New York City . Another leader of the profession is Elbridge W. Stein , of New York . Osborn and Stein never testified on opposite sides . Although consulted by adverse parties hundreds of times over a period of thirty-three years , they always independently reached identical conclusions . " Do you claim to be infallible ? " is one of the stock questions asked by cross-examiners . " No , but I claim to be careful , " is Sellers ' stock answer . " Experts disagree , do n't they ? " is another stock quest ion , to which Sellers ' stock answer is : " Qualified document examiners seldom disagree . " There is another sharp distinction between the document examiner and other experts . Test ifying is a luxury or a side line with others . The physician 's main livelihood is his medical practice . A cross-examiner may make a monkey of him in the courtroom ; that does n't cause him to lose a single patient . A lawyer may make a real-estate expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't prevent him from selling a single lot . But when a professional document examiner is torn apart in the courtroom , he suffers vital damage . The document expert can be cross-examined on his past performances . If he has made one conspicuous blunder or has appeared as the champion of one demonstrated fraud , it can be thrown in his face for the rest of his life . There is no business in which a reputation for integrity and accuracy is more important . The masters of the profession are men who have slowly built up their standings over a long period of years . Nothing could make it worth while for them to lend their prestige to a fraud . Nevertheless , it is a profession in which bad experts can get along after a fashion . Big-hearted juries are frequently eager for an excuse to acquit an obviously guilty but pathetic and appealing defendant ; they sometimes welcome a pretext for disregarding the facts and handing over an estate to an individual who works on their feelings . In such cases a bad expert may be better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ignoramus or a charlatan , he may give a jury its excuse for bringing in a sympathy verdict . In a criminal case , the sympathy verdict is final because of the once-in-jeopardy doctrine , but in a civil case a sympathy verdict is likely to be reversed on appeal . Sellers has stated that honest differences of opinion can arise among quail Geri document . examiners under certain exceptional conditions . One is where known specimens of a man 's handwriting are so scarce that it is difficult to determine whether he was the author of a disputed writing . Another is where the writer held the paper against unsteady or distorting surfaces . In one of Sellers ' cases , the first part of a signature looked genuine , but the second half looked like a forgery . It was found that the man had signed the document while seated in his automobile . He had held the paper against the oval-shaped horn button in the steering wheel . He wrote the first few letters in his ordinary hand , but the other letters were cramped and distorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real poser for experts is " guided " signatures . When a sick or dying man is unable to sign a will without assistance , the law allows another person , in the presence of witnesses , to hold his hand and aid in writing his name . Sometimes the characteristics of the sick man 's penmanship are extremely faint or undiscoverable . " Dead men 's signatures " are not unknown  --  produced when the " guide " has seized the hand after life was extinct and forced it to go through the motions of signing . " Unconscious " signatures have been brought about in a similar way . In some guided signatures , the characteristics of the sick man may be sufficiently clear to show that he co-operated intelligently in the writing . In rare instances , a good expert may miss a minute alteration which changes a document from genuine to fraudulent . A high-class lawyer usually relinquishes a civil case if he gets an adverse opinion from a trusted document examiner . A lawyer has a right to defend a criminal , no matter how guilty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the court . But it is another matter to champion a conspiracy to loot an estate . Lawyers who value their standings do n't like to be mixed up with such cases . Sometimes , however , an adverse opinion of Sellers ' fails to " take . " On one occasion a young lawyer submitted a will to the expert with a letter which said : " Please examine signature only . " Having seen scores of genuine signatures on altered and fraudulent documents , Sellers never confines himself to the examination of a signature . He thought that an inexperienced lawyer might have made such a request in good faith , with the idea that a partial examination would be cheaper than a complete one . On the other hand , the purpose could have been to obtain the expert 's endorsement of a crooked instrument . Sellers gave the document an exceptionally thorough going-over . The signature was undoubtedly genuine , but the body of I he document had some peculiarities . There were tiny holes here and there in the paper . The claim was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will having been allegedly discovered under a carpet where it had bi ; en trodden on for months . Wills that are found in strange places are called " foundlings . " Foundlings are not necessarily frauds , but a high percentage of them will not stand expert examination . In this case , the document passed the tests of the naked eye and the microscope . There were no superficial evidences of erasure and tampering . Sellers darkened his laboratory and studied the will under ultraviolet rays . It almost passed this test . At first sight , the writing appeared a uniform dull black . There were no yellowish areas in the paper to indicate that chemicals had been used for making erasures . Under minute inspection , however , one small danger signal appeared . A mark about the size of a comma gave out a alight glow . The rest of the ink was so old that it had lost its capacity to " fluoresce , " or shine dimly under ultraviolet rays . But there was an unmistakable bluish gleam at one spot , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added . Sellers found that the glow came from the upper part of the " 3 " in the date " 1938 . " One of the tiny holes in the paper occurred near the bottom of the " 3 . " It soon became clear that the " 3 " had originally been a " 2 . " The bottom part of the " 2 " had been neatly cut out . Similar minute perforations had been made in other places to give a general effect of wear and tear and to prevent the tampering with the date from attracting particular attention . The delicate surgery at the bottom of the " 2 " and a touch of the pen at the top of it had changed the date of the will from " 1928 " to " 1938 . " In his report , Sellers said : " In my opinion , the signature is genuine , but the document has been altered . " He purposely gave no details . In dubious cases , he gives general opinions only , as specific information might assist a forger in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lawyer filed the will anyway . It was shown in court that the man , after leaving his estate to one set of heirs by the will of 1928 , had changed his mind and disinherited them by a new will in 1936 . The purpose of changing the date of the original will from 1928 to 1938 was to supersede the will of 1936 and reinstate the termer heirs . The legal fight over the two wills resulted in an investigation . One of the reinstated heirs made a confession . The lawyer and one of the clients were sent to the penitentiary . Another lawyer tried a different scheme in the hope of tricking Sellers into lending his name to a forgery . A plintostal. of n will was 14111 ) 1nd:10d to Hie expert , with the explanation that 1.11e hurl been lord . Sailers found 1110 print . ton fidnl . In furnish the basis fur any conclusion .

The experl , re-pert ed the signature genuine , but the document . spurious . The lawyer went do hut . with it anyway , and wound up in jail . One of Sellers ' disappointed clients WIN n physician who , Into in life , had married a wealthy woman . She died suddenly , Other relatives filed a will which left most of the estate to them . The physician found a will of a later date which left the entire estate to him . The physician took his will to Sellers , who pronounced the signature to be a forgery . " You 've been entirely misled , " said the physician . " I am a psychologist and I can see exactly how your reasoning processes have been confused in his case . There is no doubt whatever about the genuineness of that will , ; 111d , luckily , I 've discovered absolute proof of it . I ran across something that I had completely forgotten  --  an entry in my diary under the same date as the will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eve rythi ng . " " I 'd like to examine the diary , " said Sellers . The physician produced the diary and later came to Sellers ' office for his report . " Somebody has tampered with the diary , " said Sellers . " This sheet was written quite recently , years after its supposed date . The binding of the book has been opened up and this sheet . has been inserted . If you will look at the book when I close it , you will see that the edges of the genuine leaves are tinted a pale green , but there is a white line that stands out quite noticeably . That is the sheet that was inserted with the false entry . Now , if you 'll let me open the binding , I think I can show you exactly how the thing was done . " " Give me back that book , " said the physician . " I see that something has prejudiced you , and I do n't want to have anything more to do with you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no part in the wise , but another export employed by the side testified that the will was opposite a forgery and the court so decided . In one curious case  --  the case of the petticoat will  --  a lawyer got good 1:0-Hulls by disregarding an adverse opinion from Sellers . The expert lifted his eyebrows a little when a petticoat was submitted to him us a man 's last will and testament . But he was not completely flabbergasted , as he had been called on to examine equally bizarre documents . His testimony had knocked out one will which had been forged on a matchbox and another which had been forged on the under side of one of the rungs of a stepladder . Wild wills of this kind are brought forward with the argument , " Ca n't you see that it must be genuine , because nobody would ever forge anything in such a preposterous manner ? " Sometimes an eccentric document is genuine . One will vouched for by Sellers and made the basis for the distribution of a $300,000 estate was written on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testamentary impulse , had apparently taken pen in hand and writ ten the document while seated at a table in a night club . The petticoat will was accompanied by a circumstantial narrative . A nurse was wearing the petticoat , a white cotton garment. , when the will was made . She said that her patient had suddenly cried out , " I 'm dying ! I want you to write my will for me ! " She started , she said , to hunt for paper , pen and ink , but the patient exclaimed , " I 'm going fast ! Write it on anything ! " Thereupon , she said , she wrote from his dictation on her petticoat , without pausing to take it off . She had a fever chart handy , she said , and she placed that under the garment in order to have a still " , flat background for writing . Both she and another nurse testified that they had seen the dying man take the pencil and make his cross on the petticoat . Since she was wearing the will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wrote upward toward the waistline . In other words , the bottom of the petticoat was the top of the document . After the dying man had finished dictating , the nurse , without removing the petticoat , held it toward the dying man , so that the writing was upside down to him . He Ir 1/1 in lied 01 " 11 Pain 521 bed to reach over I he writing in order to make his cross below the text . Tho petticoat testament gave $10,000 each to the two arm 's who witnessed the will , and the nnnainder of the property i t to a grandniece . The maker of the will died very shortly after this scene was alleged to hnve taken place , The nurse said that she hung the petticoat up in a closet and forgot about it for canoe multi hs . Then she suddenly remembered it and brought it to light . It was is new kind of document to Sellers . He made a series of microscopic studies of the X murk on the petticoat . He spent hours making X @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them under the microscope . Under high magnification , the X on the will gave evidence which , in the expert 's opinion , contradicted the statements of the two nurses . Since the testator wap supposed to have pulled the pencil toward him in making the X. the fibers of the cotton should p have given evidence that they had been dragged by the pencil point in that direction . In the opinion of Sellers , the fibers gave unmistakable indications that they had been dragged in the opposite direction . In other words , the expert reached the conclusion that the text of the will had not been upside down to the maker of the X ; that the dying man could not have made that particular X under the cir* * * * * * * * * * HE DID IT An opportunist is any man who goes ahead and does what you always intended to do . ? KENNETH L. KRICHBAUM. * * * * * * * * * * cumstances described . From a study of the man 's handwriting , Sellers also concluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In spite of Sellers ' findings , the grandniece won the case and got the estate . Naturally , her lawyer did n't call on Sellers to tell what he thought of the petticoat will , and the jury decided that it was genuine . Neither of the nurses received the $10,000 under the will , as the law does n't permit bequests to witnesses . Later the nurses sued the grandniece for $8000 apiece . They asserted that they had been promised $10,000 each for testifying , and had been paid only $2000 each . Their suit was thrown out , on the ground that an alleged contract to purchase eyewitness testimony is against public policy . One of the curious documents that received an adverse opinion from Sellers purported to be an autograph by Shakespeare . " If we can prove that it 's genuine , I can get seventy-five thousand dollars for it , " said the client . His figure was comparatively modest . There are only six known genuine Shakespeare signatures , and there are no other authenticated specimens of his handwriting . A genuine Shakespeare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autograph market . The name had been written in old-appearing ink on a small sblong piece a of paper . The client told Sellers there P was reason to believe that it had been cut from a volume that had once belonged to Shakespeare . A superficial examination disposed of that theory . Sellers found that . the pen had run over the top of ( lie paper and made ink steins along the edge . Such stains could rat Ittive hien preven ? in an u I e-graph cut from a hook . It was still ' towable that Shakespeare had written it as a sort of visiting card or mu a Inhol to identify hint at . an Klizabuthail playwrights ' convention , A microscopic examine ! ion of the material disposed of that . Tho paper wile pertly composed of wood pulp , which had not come into use in Shakespeare 's day . Sellers worked on another book which had marshall notes suspected of having been written by Shakespeare . The hook was of genuine Elizabethan vintage . As to the handwriting , the expert could only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough standards of comparison and that he was not . in a position to pass judgment on Shakespeare 's suspected authorship of the marginal notes . Since two Shakespearean cases had wandered into his office , Sellers , on a trip to England in 1938 , studied , photographed and enlarged the six known Shakespearean signatures and spent some time examining the more famous Shakespearean forgeries , which form a considerable literature in themselves . An adverse opinion from Sellers killed a proposed expedition to Mexico in search of $10,000,000 worth of gold and silver said to have been hidden in an ancient mining tunnel in 1730 . The promoters of the expedition told how a horse had recently kicked a 200-yearold hitching post on a Mexican hacienda and how the worm-eaten wood flew to pieces , exposing a secret compartment which contained an ancient document giving exact directions for locating the gigantic cache of precious metal . The document purported to be the work of a member of a band of hijackers who bad captured a treasure-laden train of mules in 1730 . It told how he and his confederates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a sort of road map intended to lead them back to the treasure after the excitement had blown over . Why they never come back for the document was a mystery , but it was supposed that they were captured and slain . After the horse kicked the hitching post , the promoters of the expedition took the document to Los Angeles to induce investors to contribute to a fund to buy mules and t rucks to salvage the bullion . One Los Angeles man put some money into the project . Called on to furnish $10,000 more , he borrowed the document and asked Sellers for an opinion on it . Examining a shred of the paper , Sellers found that it contained esparto grass , which was formerly a substitute for linen in paper-making . Esparto-grass paper first came into use , however , about 1850 ? more than 100 years after the supposed date of the document . An examination of the writing showed that it bad been done with a modern steel pen , indicating that the hijackers were many Years ahead of their time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholar was called who found that the text was in modern Spanish , with no trace of the idiom of 200 years ago . The ancient appearance of the paper could have been produced by baking it for a short time in a moderate oven . The expert 's opinion ended that particular treasure hunt , but similar ones are still open to investors .
