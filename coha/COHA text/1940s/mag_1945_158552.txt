Last week was still too early to estimate the rate or the degree of Europe 's economic comeback , but there were already isolated examples of Europe 's surprising ability to pick itself up from its wreckage : <P> A quick survey of newly liberated ports facing the North Sea indicated that supplies from the outside world might soon be unloaded . Hamburg 's port was a shambles , with the hulks of more than 50 large ships sunk in the harbor . But damage to the docks was not so great as expected , and British minesweepers were busy clearing the channel . At Bremerhaven and Wesermnde it was believed that 20 Liberty ships could soon be docked . Eight ships could dock at Bremen . <P> The opening of these ports will mean that the ports of France and the Low Countries can more quickly carry a flow of peacetime goods . Rotterdam docks are in fairly good shape , but the harbor is still blocked by sunken shipping . <P> The indomitable Dutch had production rolling in the N. V. Philips Co. ' s huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to high-priority electrical gadgets for the Allied armies , production at Eindhoven included such prosaic , civilian essentials as pots and pans. * <P> When Army G-5 surveyed the rubble that had been Cologne they discovered , surprisingly enough , that the Ford Motor Co. plant was only 15% damaged by bombs and artillery fire . More surprising , G-5 found that some hundreds of trucks could be assembled from the large stock of parts on hand . Apparently , the mauling given the German railroad system by Allied airmen had not entirely blocked the delivery of carburetors , engines , chassis , etc. , from subcontractors throughout Germany . Promptly G-5 summoned the Burgomaster of Cologne , ordered him to round up Ford workers , get them back to work . Their production last week : ten trucks a day , delivered to the U.S. Army for transporting supplies . <P> At Le Havre , transatlantic cable messages are pouring through the Commercial Cable Co. ' s operating room , deep in a dark , dank cellar . Divers had patched the broken cable link with the U.S. , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the company could not move its operating offices above ground until a suitable building could be found in badly battered Le Havre . <P> The Paris plant of International Telephone &; Telegraph Corp. , which escaped with little destruction because of hasty German retreat , was able to do an immediate rush job for the U.S. Army , after the liberation of Paris : it delivered a complete radio station to SHAEF within 24 hours . <P> The thrice-bombed B. F. Goodrich Co. ' s Paris plant , now sweating out 500 tires a day , plans to double its output . <P> As European industry creaks back to life , lack of raw materials is a brake on production . All industries are short of steel , coal , chemicals , rubber , textiles , oil . <P> * With the enemy gone , the Dutch dared tell how they had assembled clandestine radio sets during the German occupation . When Allied air raids sent German guards scurrying for shelter , Dutch workers pilfered radio parts from the Philips plant , passed them to radio men of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
