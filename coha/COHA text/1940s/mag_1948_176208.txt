" I weep for you , " the Walrus said : " I deeply sympathize " With sobs and tears he sorted out Those of the largest size , Holding his pocket-handkerchief Before his streaming eyes . <P> Tired of their butchers ' sympathetic tears , the nation 's housewives put on a limited but bitter uprising last week . Month after month , penny after penny , the rising price of meat had stretched their nerves taut . Meat bills were 25% above last year 's , 170% to 200% above 1939 . Across the land , women began boycotting their butchers . <P> In Dallas , a robust lady strode up to a man with a package of meat under his arm , demanded : " Do n't you know that no decent-minded citizen should buy meat ? " In Utica , N.Y. , a " Budget Brigade " of 3,000 women phoned other women , asked them to stop buying meat . In Detroit , housewives set up stands outside the markets and exhorted customers not to enter . A man on stilts teetered through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't buy any meat for two weeks . You 'll live . " <P> Facing the storm , most butchers professed to find no appreciable change in their trade . Said a Kansas City butcher : " They 're all hollering , but they 're all buying . " Others admitted sales had dropped off , in some cases 35% to 50% . In Los Angeles , 34 small butchers were forced to close . But prices did not budge . <P> The boycotting was local , enthusiastic , uncoordinated , and made no claim to staying power . Even if the drive could be organized on a nationwide scale , housewives were not at all sure that they had the answer . But they were sure that somebody should do something . Last spring a Gallup poll showed the public strongly opposed to the return of controls . Last week Gallup reported that the nation now favored , by an amazing 56% to 35% , restoration of both price controls and rationing of many retail products .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
