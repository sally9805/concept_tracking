" Boys , this is a championship fight and has to be a good fight . I do n't want you . . . backpedaling and running away from each other all the time . You realize one of the points on which the judges and referee arrive at a decision is effective aggressiveness . . . . " <P> One of the two boys who got this straight talk from New York 's new Boxing Administrator Eddie Eagan ( TIME , Jan. 22 ) was the world 's featherweight champion , Willie Pep . A master boxer with a featherweight punch , he had been dubbed " BackPedaling Bill " by the fans . But in last week 's 15-round championship battle with Bronx Phil Terranova , Hartford 's nimble 124-lb . Willie put on the fighting-est show of his career . <P> After taking a fourth-round sock on the jaw , he stood his ground for the next eight rounds , coolly exploiting the art of hitting and not being hit . Then , realizing that he was far ahead on points , Hartford Willie coasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pep 's championship bout drew 10,247 customers . Four nights later , Welterweight Walker ( " Sugar Ray Robinson " ) Smith ( 148 lbs. ) proved that punches speak louder than titles . A crowd of 18,060 jam-packed Madison Square Garden to see chocolate-colored Sugar Ray knock the block off game Middleweight Jake La Motta ( 158 Ibs . ) . <P> This was the kind of solid fighting the fans wanted , the kind that conscientious Commissioner Eagan , himself a famed amateur boxer , used to provide in younger days .
