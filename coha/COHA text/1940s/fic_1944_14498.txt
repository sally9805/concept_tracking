A YOUNG WOMAN comes on stage hastily opening a letter . As she crosses down stage , she is reading her letter . She stops beside a chair , its back to the audience , and rests her arm on the chair back . Her little SON enters with a roughly drawn map and some crayons . He climbs up into the chair  --  stands on seat . JACKIE Mother ? She reads on . Mother ? Mother ? MOTHER Yes , Jackie . JACKIE What color is the Pacific Ocean ? MOTHER The Pacific ? Green , I think . JACKIE Like all the other oceans ? MOTHER Absorbed . What is it , dear ? JACKIE Like all the other oceans ? MOTHER Yes , I think so . There is a silence , while he applies green . JACKIE Mother ? Mother ? MOTHER Please let me read my letter , Jackie . JACKIE Who 's it from ? MOTHER It 's from daddy . JACKIE Oh . From out on the Pacific Ocean ? p. 3 MOTHER Yes . JACKIE That 's why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daddy 's out there on it . Mother  --  how do you spell Australia ? MOTHER Finishing the letter , looking up . I do n't know . JACKIE Yes , you do . You told me yesterday how to spell it . Why do you look at me that way ? MOTHER Because  --  part of this letter is to you . JACKIE For me ? From daddy ? MOTHER Yes . I told him you could read now . So he wrote a letter very plainly , so plain that you could read it . JACKIE He takes the letter . Oh . I do n't read writing so very well . Will you read it to me first , mother ? MOTHER Yes , of course . He gives her the letter . " Dear Jackie : This is the first letter I have ever written directly to my little son . I was certainly glad to hear your voice over the long-distance telephone . It sounded as though I were right there in the living room with you . You sounded as though you missed your daddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than anyone will ever know . It is too bad this war could not have been delayed a few more years so that I could grow up again with you and do all the things I planned to do when you were old enough to go to school . When you are a little bigger you will know why your daddy is not home so much any more . You know , we have a big country , and we have ideals as to how people should live and enjoy the riches of it , and how each is born with equal rights to life , freedom and the pursuit of happiness . Unfortunately , there are some countries in the world where they do n't have these ideals , where a boy can not grow up to be what he wants to be , with no limits on his opportunities to be a great man . Fighting for the defense of our country , ideals , home and honor is an honor and a duty which your daddy has to do before he can come home to settle down with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either in sports or in your business or profession when you grow up . Stay close to mother and obey her in everything , no matter how much you may at times disagree . She will never let you down or lead you away from the right and honorable things of life . If I do n't get back , you will have to be mother 's protector , because you will be the only one she has . Love , Daddy . " p. 4 JACKIE I certainly hope he comes back soon . MOTHER Yes . JACKIE Why does he say , " If I do n't get back " ? Is n't he coming home ? MOTHER When they saw him last his ship was sinking and he was fighting the fire  --  JACKIE His ship was sinking ? MOTHER Yes . JACKIE Did it sink , mother ? MOTHER Yes . JACKIE I do n't think his ship could ever sink . MOTHER I wish I did n't have to tell you . But he was honest with you . And so I have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . JACKIE Never ? MOTHER No . But he sent you this letter to keep . This letter . It will have to take his place  --  It 's late , now , darling . You must be going to bed . JACKIE Could I take the letter with me , mother ? MOTHER Yes . JACKIE I 'm pretty little now , mother , but I will take care of you , and I 'll do everything  --  everything he says . MOTHER I know , darling . I know . Come now . They go out.
