FRENCHMAN 'S CREEK-Daphne du Maurier-Doubleday , Doran ( $2.50 ) . <P> Daphne du Maurier 's Rebecca , one of the three best-selling novels of 1939 , was an exceedingly well-told problem story of the troubles of being a second wife ; it was tailor-made for the land of high divorce rates . Frenchman 's Creek , just as well-told , is even nearer that bull's-eye where best-sellers are scored : the heart of the U.S. housewife . <P> Glamor is added to Frenchman 's Creek by rigging everyone in costume ( vaguely Restoration ) and setting him high in the social scale . But the story of Lady Dona St. Columb is the same story that hundreds of women's-magazine serials have told &; told again : the temptation and fall-strictly temporary-of a respectable woman . Says Lady Dona , over-assessing herself in the time-honored fashion of housewives : <P> " She had played too long a part un worthy of her . She had consented to be the Dona her world had demanded-a superficial , lovely creature , who walked , and talked , and laughed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as natural homage to her beauty , careless , insolent , deliberately indifferent , and all the while another Dona , a strange , phantom Dona , peered at her from a dark mirror and was ashamed . " <P> This other Dona ( whom thousands of Miss du Maurier 's readers know as " the real me , " ) knew that " life need not be bitter , nor worthless , nor bounded by a narrow casement , but could be limitless , infinite-that it meant suffering , and love , and danger , and sweetness , and more than this even , much more . " How much more , Miss du Maurier wisely neglects to say ; but she does bring on , as Dona 's lover , the one sort of man who could conceivably supply it : a Frenchman ( They Understand Love ) . He is a philosophical pirate , as tired of the world , as intent on what the pair anachronistically calls " escape , " as Dona herself . <P> Dona meets him while she is rusticating , away from it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is assisted in her intrigue by one of those button-mouthed little men-servants whose lines , always the wittiest in the play , terminate in a dry " my lady . " With the pirate , Dona forgets her inept domesticity in a mischievous piratical foray against her dunderhead neighbors , and in the 17th-Century equivalent of a long weekend at Atlantic City . <P> In the long run she is saved by the most classic of gongs : the frightened crying , in the night , of one of her children . But not before Miss du Maurier has squeezed the escapade dry in scene after well-constructed scene . <P> She has what most of her colleagues in this sort of fictioneering lack : a really considerable talent for romantic narrative , an ability to make plush-and-rhinestones look like the real thing .
