txt Concerted warnings of high officials against war factionalism and selfish fiscal interests indicate rising Administration apprehension over the home front . So far Congress has paid little heed and in one instance at least has flouted the warnings . In the fast three days the following spokesmen have issued " home front " appeals : Representative Sam Rayburn ( D ) of Texas , Speaker of the House . James F. Byrnes , War Mobiliiation Director . Chester Bowles , Price Administrator . Charles E. Wilson , Executive Vice-Chairman , War Production Board . These are nonpolitical appeals , coming in President Roosevelt 's absence , and voiced either by successful businessmen like Mr. Wilson , of General Electric , Mr. Bowles , of a prominent advertising firm , or by " right wing " members of the Administration , former Associate Supreme Court Justice Byrnes of South Carolina , and the well-liked Speaker of the House , Mr. Rayburn . Speeches Much Alike The speeches have a close similarity , indicating a possible concerted program , attacking factionalism , and particularly stressing the danger of inflation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing further living cost advances , and the presence of many elements of new high inflationary pressure . Instead of heeding the Byrnes radio plea for higher taxes , however , the Senate Finance Committee , so far at any rate , has steacitlycut dOWn the HeitSe ' faX ' .1:1111 ; ' ready gonsidered .. dangerously inadequate by - tfie TreasttrY , ' while yesterday the Senate , 74 to 4 , voted a flat eight-cent rail pay raise for 1,100,000 workers over the earlier ban ' by Fred M. Vinson , Stabilization Chief . The series of official appeals to the country began Tuesday , Dec. 7 , with in address by Mr. Byrnes. frequently called the " lieutenant-president , " who warned of inflation dangers , depicted a home front crisis , and made three specific appeals to Congress and the country : to support increased taxes , to retain food subsidies , and to resist special favors for " pistol-toting " pressure groups . On the same night , over another network . Chestet Bowles also warned the country of inflationary dangers , declaring at one point : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The " hold-the-line " order is in danger by the conflict of rival business . farm and labor groups , he said . " We are sitting , " he declared , " on the edge of a volcano . " On Wednesday , Dec . B. Mr. Wilson addressed the National Association of Manufacturers in New York , warning against " passions and prejudices " that might brew up society into " partisan gne.ips and cliques . " Such action played into the hands " of the enemy " and jeopardized " our entire national future . " Urging fellow industrialists " to withhold encouragement from dangerous men who preach disunity . " and declared : " I tell you frankly that I am deeply alarmed Deer the possibility that a right wing reaction may draw some sections of capital so far away from our traditions as to imperil the entire structure of American life as we know it . " ! Latest of the series of warnings came dramatically when Speaker Rayburn left his seat as presiding officer of the House yesterday , and made one of his infrequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was greeted by standing applause . Mr. Rayburn 's warning was like the earlier three : he deplored " dangerous trends " in public talk about the war , and equally dangerous efforts of pressure groups and individuals to profit by them . He assailed domestic critics of America 's allies . Russia and Britain , and also " whisperings " about America 's mil , itary leadership . He went on to the economic field , denouncing selfish groups who seek " uncontrolled inflation of what I have to sell , but controlled prices on what I have to buy . " Supplementing these various appeals are the regular monthly costof-living figures , published here today by the Labor Department , coupled with OWI information . For the second month the cost of living has risen , the figures show , amounting to .4 of 1 per cent between Sept. 15 and Oct. 15 , though it is still below the wartime peak reached last May . " An outstanding : factor against stabiiization , " the report says , . is an increase in money in circulation to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or $5 , - 000,000.000 over the same period last year . The effect of this campaign of high officials to carry the warning of inflation and disunity to the public is yet to be seen in pingress , but may ultimately be reflected in a stiffening of the public 's attitude at home . The Treasury asked Congress to increase taxes by $10,500,000,000 to siphon off inflationary pressure , but the House reduced this to one-fifth , and so far the Senate Finance Committee , where the tax bill now rests , has been daily cutting the amount still more . Mr. Byrnes urged Congress to : support Mr. Vinson 's hand in the rail wage matter , and against other pressure groups , but the Senate overwhelmingly passed the resolution for the rail pay ' rise yesterday . On the one subject of subsidies ? there are signs that the Adminis- I tration may ultimately win its fight , or secure a compromise . Though the House passed a bill killing all food subsidies after Dec. 131 , in defiance of the Administration 's appeal , the Senate shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer , and " white collar " protests .
