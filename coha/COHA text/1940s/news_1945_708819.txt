txt By Cable to Tax NEW YORK Tates . LONDON , July ** Clement R. Attlee , in his first speech as Britain 's Prime Minister , pledged anew tonight this nation 's determination " to finish the war with Japan " and expressed the belief that the result of the British election would give heart throughout the world to those " who believe in freedom , democracy and social justice . " Coming directly from Buckingham Palace after accepting King George VI 's commission to form a new Government , Mr. Attlee addressed a wildly enthusiastic Labor party victory rally in Westminster Central Hall , not more than 100 yards from the House of Commons his party now dominates . Seeming just the slightest bit dazed by the tumultuous day , Mr. Attlee outlined his new Government 's job in a few sentences . " We have , first of all , to finish the war against Japan , " he declared . " We shall see to it that our men in the East get all the support they need . " We want the fullest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will banish war forever . " We want a widespread prosperity among all the peoples and nations of the world . The Tasks at Home " Here at home we have our own great tasks . We have to bind up the wounds of war . We have to reconstruct our ruined homes  --  a great task in itself . We have to bring back in due course the workers who have been working on the war to be workers for peace . We have a job to build up in this country the highest standard of life that we can achieve for all . " Flanked by his chief lieutenants , Herbert Morrison and Ernest Bevin , and with the wives of all three beaming beside them , Mr. Attlee called on the crowd of 2,000 // to " think of all our comrades , too , all the world over , because we are a great Internationale . Its principles are plain , based upon the brotherhood of man . " The crowd cheered him for several minutes when he walked onto the platform . There was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group . When they asked Mr. Attlee to make the " V " sign , Mr. Bevin nodded disapprovingly , obviously thinking of its association with Winston Churchill , and gave a thumbs up salute , which the new Prime Minister followed . Tributes to Churchill From Mr. Morrison and Prof. Harold Laski , chairman of the Labor party 's National Executive Council and most controversial ' single figure in the bitter election campaign , came tributes to Mr. Churchill . " I want , in the name of the Labor party , to thank Mr. Churchill for his great services to the British nation , " Professor Laski said . " It is a hard night for Mr. Churchill but it is not of our making . It is the British people who have spoken and we thank them for the full maturing of British democracy . " Mr. Morrison also spoke of the nation 's indebtedness to Mr. Churchill for his wai leadership but added that the Conservative leader was a failure as a political leader . His failures , Mr. Morrison said , had been his underestimating , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broadcast , his abuse of colleagues he formerly had praised and , finally , his tour of London that " does not belong to Mr. Churchill , never did and never will . " To great cheering , Mr. Bevin said the British people by their votes had put " an end to the conception of personal government in this country . * * * The electorate cast their votes for a policy , not a personality . " Could Rule " Forever " Like all the other speakers , he warned that the new Government 's task was not going to be easy ? a theme Mr. Morrison elaborated on later by saying that Labor could rule uninterruptedly for twenty years , " or forever " if it took advantage of its opportunity to get done the work it had promised during the campaign . Professor Laski told the rally that the result was a great victory for Socialism but , even more , a " great victory for the British people who have sent a message of hope to every democracy in the world . " " At long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible a full friendship with the Soviet Union . At long last we will be in a position to do full justice to our Spanish comrades . We shall give no help to decaying monarchs or obsolete social systems . " Both the Messrs . Attlee and Bevin had to leave the hall to speak from a balcony to cheering thousands in the streets who could not gain admittance . When the rally was finished , Mr. Attlee was almost mobbed leaving the building . Earlier in the day , amid similar scenes of enthusiasm by his supporters , he made a brief statement saying " it is a very remarkable and gratifying result which shows that the electorate will respond to a clear and definite policy based on principles and on the application of those principles to the needs of the day . " " This is the first time in the history of the country that Labor has ever had a clear majority , and it will enable us to implement the policy laid down by the Socic " st party , " he said . For a New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We never will swerve from our contentions that we need a new world order to prevent war , " Mr. Attlee declared . Acclaimed throughout the country as Britain 's man of the hour , Mr. Attlee stands now on the ' threshold of 10 Downing Street after having fought in politics for twenty-six years for the cause of socialism . Mr. Attlee himself easily won re-election from his bomb-battered Limehouse district in London 's East End , defeating Lieut . Alfred Woodward , a Conservative , 8,396 to 1,618 . He , his wife and 18-year-old daughter listened to returns there . " Confidence in Labor " He said : " I believe the people have made up their minds as to the kind of policy they want and they have confidence Labor can deliver the goods . " Later , at a press conference , Mr. Attlee explained that the Labor party went into the election with a " carefully thought-out program based on very definite principles . These clever , clever people of the Conservative central office with Mr. Churchill and his political agents have proved much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise and sound in its outlook . " He said the Labor party 's foreign policy had been set in the days when Arthur Henderson was Foreign . Secretary . " The business of the Labor Government will he bold , determined , sound and sensible to carry through their program , " he said . " We have a combination of boldness and good sense . " The Labor program advocates nationalization of basic industries such as railroads , steel and coal mining , public ownership of the Bank of England and ultimate nationalization of the land . " Red Herrings " Hit LONDON , July 26 ( U.P. )  - -  - Mr . Morrison , one of the Labor party big three in the Commons along with the Messrs . Attlee and Bevin , in an interview said : " Winston Churchill was hopelessly astray from the beginning . He cultivated ' red herrings . ' He made himself contemptible . I predicted I would look at Churchill from the Treasury bench the Government side of the Commons , with himself as Chancellor of the Exchequer with him on the Opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labor Government will give Britain a bold , determined , sound and sensible administration . Its high proportion of young members will provide a virile Parlia-1 ment . The outstanding feature of the election was the swing of the middle classes to the Labor party . " The electorate wanted to consider quietly and thoroughly the ' real issues . The Conservatives tried to turn the election into a plebiscite for Churchill and the country regarded their tactics as Nazi practice . The country felt it was being tricked . The Conservatives were much too clever . "
