 | Dr. Will and Dr. Charlie Condensed from Scribner 's Commentator Edward M. Brecher THE MAYO BROTHERS were " Dr. Will " and " Dr. Charlie " to the pioneer families in Rochester , Minn . And to everybody who knew them they remained " Dr. Will " and " Dr. Charlie , " even after their practice had transformed the prairie village into the world 's most famous medical center . When the Mayo boys ' father , English-born Dr. William Worrall Mayo , came to Minnesota in 1855 , settlers were so few and so healthy that the " Little Doctor " eked out his income by surveying , working on a Mississippi River boat , and serving as army surgeon during the Indian wars . From one of his war trophies ? the skeleton of Chief Broken Nose ? Will and Charlie learned to name every bone in the human body at an age when other youngsters struggle with the multiplication table . Despite his isolated post , the Little Doctor kept abreast of medicine 's rapid . progress . In 1871 , though well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year at Bellevue in New York City . The epochal work of Pasteur and Lister was then centering attention on germs , infection and antisepsis , and the Little Doctor returned to Rochester longing for a microscope . The entire family shared his enthusiasm and the Mayo homestead was mortgaged to raise the needed $600 . It took 10 years to pay off the debt ; but during those years Will and Charlie acquired a skill in microscopy then possessed by few full-fledged physicians . That brass microscope is now Exhibit No. 1 in the Mayo Museum . As his reputation grew , patients from miles around came to the Little Doctor for major operations . Since there was no hospital , spare bedrooms were equipped as makeshift operating rooms . In one of these , the Little Doctor would set up his portable surgical table and wield instruments which the village blacksmith made for him out of teeth from an old grain reaper . Will , at 13 , acted as " scrub nurse " and Charlie , only 9 and short for his age , sterilized the instruments by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Charlie also served as a mobile surgical cabinet , with suture threads and strands of catgut dangling from his lapels and buttons .  | In the midst of one operation , the assisting doctor giving the anesthetic fainted . Soon racked with pain , the poor woman on the table strained and struggled . " Charlie , give her more ether ! " called his father . Charlie tried , but he was too short to reach the patient 's head . The taller Will could n't drop what he was doing . Fortunately a cracker-box stood handy , and with it Charlie met the emergency . From such experiences , Will and Charlie are said to have known more when they entered medical school than many a senior . Will took his M.D. at Michigan in 1883 , Charlie at Northwestern in 1888 . But only death terminated their education . Both did postgraduate work in New York , and after they began practice in Rochester took turns attending lectures and demonstrations in Chicago . As the years went on , they became surgery 's most indefatigable travelers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , teaching as well as learning . In 1883 a tornado struck Rochester , killing and injuring hundreds . Homes left standing were turned into hastily improvised hospitals . The Sisters of St. Francis , who helped with the nursing , were so impressed by the work of the three Mayos in the emergency that they offered to build a hospital for Rochester if Dr. Mayo would take charge . " I 'm too old , " said the Little Doctor , then nearing 70 . " Your sons will carry on , " the Sisters told him . St. Mary 's Hospital was opened late in 1889 with 13 patients . The first year and a quarter Dr. Will and Dr. Charlie performed 219 operations during the mornings , attended to their general practice afternoons , and served as male nurses nightly . Today St. Mary 's is the largest of the half-dozen hospitals independently owned but affiliated with the Mayo Clinic . The Little Doctor himself " carried on , " for nearly a quarter of a century . At 87 he traveled alone around the world on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clinics of Mexico . He died in 1911 , at the age of 92 . As village doctors , Dr. Will and Dr. Charlie divided their practice geographically . One took all the patients north and east of Quale 's Drugstore , the other took the rest . Later they divided surgically , Dr. Charlie taking all the territory north of the abdominal diaphragm and south of the pelvis , while Dr. Will took the vital central region . Dr. Will was best known for work on cancer of the stomach ; Dr. Charlie for goiter and other thyroid operations , but actually both were almost " universal specialists . " They published more than moo contributions to medical literature , covering an amazing range ; they were probably the most prolific writers in surgical annals . It was the Mayos ' good fortune  | to launch their careers at a time when surgery , armed with anesthetics and antiseptics , was entering new fields . Dr. Charlie has given a modest account of how he was " projected " into operations on the thyroid gland . A big Norwegian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head hack . Dr. Charlie had to improvise a technique . It was highly successful ; he perfected it and by 1935 more than 27,000 goiter patients had passed through the Mayo Clinic . Other surgeons began to learn of the amazing work being done at Rochester . Dr. Will , when barely 40 , wrote a report of 200 gall-bladder operations which so astounded the editor of the ' annals of Surgery that he journeyed west to find out whether the author was a liar or a genius . He found the two modest brothers operating in a way which met or surpassed the standards of the finest Eastern hospitals . A dozen gallbladder operations were performed during his visit . Two years later Dr. Will reported on his first moo gallbladder cases . Thereafter squadrons of medical men came west to watch the Mayos work . Physicians sent their most difficult cases . They came themselves when in need of major surgery ; and , as one of them put it , " We always bought round-trip tickets . " To meet the needs of their growing practice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could find . It was said they " induced 500 members of the world 's most highly individualistic profession to live and work together in a small town on the edge of nowhere ? and like it . " Faced with the problem of treating patients as an organic whole , and at the same time giving them a specialist 's care , they assembled under one roof experts in almost everything , combining the work of many on a single case . Mayo fellows come from every state in the Union , from Heidelberg and Cape Town , Uruguay and Iceland . Some 1500 of them have spent three years or more in Rochester , then carried the Mayo tradition not only all over the United States but also to the remotest medical outposts . One became chief surgeon to the King of Siam . Another serves the Maharajah of Mysore . Others operate in Antwerp , Shansi , Oslo , and Jerusalem . Although the Mayo walls were covered with awards , citations , and honorary degrees the brothers blushed to hear themselves described as " modern miracle workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . " When speakers referred to some new procedure as " the Mayo operation , " Dr. Charlie would call it " the Hippocrates-Mayo operation , " to indicate their debt to predecessors . The Mayos made the Clinic a democracy , giving one vote to each staff member of five years ' standing . They placed themselves and all their associates on regular salary ,  | and provided for pensions and insurance . They made it possible for each staff member to make at least one medical inspection tour a year at the Clinic 's expense . Despite a high proportion of patients treated free or at cost , by 1915 the brothers had accumulated $1,500,000 . With this sum , later increased to $2,80o,000 , they endowed the Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research at the University of Minnesota . " The money came from the people , " Dr. Will declared , " and it should go back to the people . " Dr. Charlie called the fund " the contribution of the sick of this generation to prevent sickness and suffering in the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a meeting place for men of medicine , and move into a smaller house . On the day in 1929 that Dr. ' Charlie performed his last operation , a son , Dr. Charles William Mayo , performed his first operation as a Clinic surgeon . Today , he alone carries on the family name at the Clinic . Drs . Will and Charlie died , two months apart , in the summer o 1939 . The Mayo tradition , which ha attracted more than a million patients and made Rochester the medical crossroads of the world , is perhaps best characterized by a favorite motto framed on Dr. Will 's desk " If you do one thing well , though you dwell in the midst of a forest the world will beat a path to you door .
