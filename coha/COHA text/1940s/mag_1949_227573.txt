The Lord takes care of me as his sheep ; I will not be without any good thing . <P> He makes a resting-place for me in the green fields ; he is my guide by the quiet waters . <P> He gives new life to my soul : he is my guide in the ways of righteousness because of his name . <P> Yes , though I go through the valley of deep shade , I will have no fear of evil ; for you are with me , your rod and your support are my comfort . <P> You make ready a table for me in front of my haters : you put oil on my head ; my cup is overflowing . <P> Truly , blessing and mercy will be with me all the days of my life ; and I will have a place in the house of the Lord all my days . <P> - The Bible in Basic English , Psalm 23 <P> The job of translating the Bible into Basic English began 20 years ago , under the direction of Samuel Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the University of London .
