The West Coast correspondent for Lord Beaverbrook 's London Daily Express was one of the busiest men in Los Angeles last week . Covering the Mann Act trial of Charles Spencer Chaplin for both British and Australian newspapers , he had to file two separate stories every day . For Britons , to whom British Subject Chaplin is still the lovable , great little cockney comedian , he was carefully sympathetic . But for Australians he could be tougher and more realistic . <P> Australians have begun to acquire the U.S. view of a Chaplin minus mustache and baggy pants , the off-screen Chaplin who is a dapper , grey multimillionaire of 54 , widely envied in Hollywood for his unassailable arrogance and for his affairs with a succession of pretty young " proteges . " <P> Auburn-haired Joan Berry , 24 , who wandered from her native Detroit to New York to Hollywood in pursuit of a theatrical career , became a Chaplin protegee in the summer of 1941 . She fitted into a familiar pattern . Chaplin signed her to a $75-a-week contract , began training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks after the contract was signed she became his mistress . Throughout the summer and autumn , Miss Berry testified last week , she visited the ardent actor five or six times a week . By midwinter her visits were down to " maybe three times a week . " By late summer of 1942 Chaplin had decided that she was unsuited for his movie . Her contract ended . <P> Then followed the episode in dispute last week . According to Miss Berry , Chaplin asked her to go to New York " to be near him " while he went to make a speech , urging a Second Front , at a pro-Soviet rally in Carnegie Hall . She was with him just once during a 23-day stay , but that once , she said , involved a three-hour visit to his Waldorf-Astoria bedroom . Back in Beverly Hills , she broke into his mansion one night with a pistol , " intending to kill myself , " held the gun for an hour until he talked her into bed again . Admitted by both sides : Chaplin paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , did not pay her hotel bills . Asserted by the defense : she went at her own request ; Chaplin had no " intent " to transport her for immoral purposes and did not consummate any such purpose in New York . <P> Chaplin 's lawyer , slick Jerry Giesler ( attorney for Errol Flynn , Alexander Pantages ) had a battery of witnesses waiting to testify that Joan Berry was no one-man girl . Judge J. F. T. O'Connor , onetime ( 1933-38 ) U.S. Comptroller of the Currency , shooed away this legal red herring as often as it appeared . The prosecutor , Charles H. Carr , argued : " Even if you put a common prostitute on the stand , it would be immaterial as to how many men she might have had affairs with in the past . " The only issue was the technical one of Chaplin 's " intent " in paying Joan Berry 's fare from Los Angeles to New York and return . If the jury should find that he intended to bed with her , conviction on two charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring him a maximum sentence of $10,000 fine and ten years in prison , presumably to be followed by deportation as an undesirable alien .
