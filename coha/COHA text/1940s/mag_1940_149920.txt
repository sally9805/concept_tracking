After a beautiful woman , Mexicans most love a martyr . Next best is a hero . For a dozen years comely , dark-eyed Conception Aceveda de la Llata , Madre Conchita ( a Capuchin nun ) , has been all three . She became a sort of Mexican Tom Mooney . <P> Twelve years ago Madre Conchita was arrested , charged with exerting an occult influence over the assassin who shot down Catholic-hounding President-elect General Don Alvaro Obregon . She was sentenced to 20 years ' imprisonment in the grim penal colony on the Tres Marias Islands . With gentle , biblical good spirits she went to work as nurse , teacher and confidante . Her fame spread throughout her country . <P> Two years ago she was transferred to the Federal Prison in Mexico City . Belonging to an order of nuns whose vows are not perpetual , she was presently released , married another prisoner who had been sentenced for a previous attempt on Obregon . A priest , Father Jose Jimenez , also serving a term , for complicity in the Obregon murder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular opinion and the hard work of her previously released husband induced new President General Manuel Avila Camacho , who wants to be friends with the Church , to commute her term . As her fellow prisoners waved tearful farewells and the Mexican press broke into congratulatory headlines , Seiiora Castro Balda walked out through the prison gates . A vindicated martyr , at 49 more bloomingly plump than ever , she drove with her husband to the Villa Madero , placed a grateful bouquet at the foot of the Virgin of Guadalupe.
