PART SEVEN 11 DAY , Tuo-mlny. 41111114. 6111. 1914 . Advance 1 ' . P. linear P01-101mnuth1 . The landings have gone better than expected . Every outfit is ashore but we have just had a report that Maj. Gen. Leonard T. Gerow , with his 5th Corps , ca n't get of one of its beaches because of hostile mortar and artillery fire . This is OMAHA Beach . They called the air for some bombing ; air came back and said pinpoint the places , and there the matter rests to the moment , Ike , however , wondering what 21st Army Group is doing about it . Last night , starting from camp at 6:00 , we hit out for the 101st Airborne Division around Newbury . We saw hundreds of paratroopers , with blackened and grotesque faces , packing up for the big hop and jump . Ike wandered through them , stepping over packs , guns and a variety of equipment such as only paratroop people can devise , chinning with this and that one . Ike was promised a job after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dallied his cows , and at least there was enough to eat in the work . Ike has developed an informality and friendliness with troopers that almost amazes me . We returned to camp about 1:15 , sat around the nickel-plated office caravan in silence , each with his own thoughts and trying to borrow , by psychological osinosis , those of the Supreme Commander , until I became the first to say to hell with it and excused myself to bed . There I expected a phone call from Lt. Col. Hugh Barkley , an Intelligence officer of the 101st . Every half hour or so during the remainder of the night I awakened , said to myself , . Have I heard from Barkley ? and finding the'answer no , went back to sleep ; at H Hour , by coincidence , I was awake , when suddenly there came the call . It was Leigh-Mallory himself . Wanted to speak to the boss . Could I take the message ? Yes , if you 've got a scrambler . Yes , in the other tent . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marshal , only 21 of the American C-47 's out of the 850 were missing . Only four gliders were unaccounted for . Of the ' British , eight C-47 's were AWOL out of some 400 . Amazing good luck . And an RAF Intruder had seen the British paras drop , and it went off smooth , smooth indeed . " Grand , " said I , " grand . I 'll tell the boss as soon as he wakes up . " So I tiptoed down the cinder path to Ike 's circus wagon to see if he was asleep . I saw him silhouetted in bed behind a Western . Ike grinned as he lit a cigarette . I was almost the first with good news , but Admiral Ramsay had just been on the phone , telling him things seemed to be going by plan , and had no bad news at all . Later on , along came Lt. Gen. Fred Morgan , who did much of the hard work on the Great Plan , which Ike reminded him of , and to which Morgan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Also present DDAY and first news from the new front . De Gaulle " lectures " General Ike . The Supreme Commander goes to France . Atom bomb predicted . Monty gets some urging . Dissatisfaction at headquarters . The attack gets under way . was Maj. Gen. Strong , the G-2 of G-2 's , who allowed as how we had surprisingly surprised the Germans and , therefore , in the game of war , had achieved " tactical surprise , " and let them try to prove otherwise . Monty was getting off late today to set up his HQ across the Channel  --  his tactical one , where he likes to be . Ike invited him to see the world press representatives , to which Monty said a not surprising yes , any time before three . But I have n't reported on the visit of de Gaulle and the Prime Minister here on Sunday . The P. M. called Ike , saying he wanted ten minutes with him before de Gaulle got there . Churchill was an hour late getting here , talked quickly to Ike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided in the meantime that Ike had to keep the latter sufficiently informed so he could broadcast a word of encouragement to the French . So Ike took them all on a Cook 's tour of the war room , and de Gaulle lectured on how he would do it . Whereupon Ike and de Gaulle strolled up the shady cinder path in front of the Signals tent , where there was enough elbowroom for the Frenchman to wave his arms and talk . // SIIAEF , Ativanee C.P them- Portsmouth ' , Thundday . June H. 194.1 . Yesterday Ike visited our beachhead along the French coast . We departed at 8:00 from the " King 's Steps " in the Portsmouth naval dockyard , where we boarded the fast minelayer H.M.S. Apollo . I had taken helmets and gas masks and cameras in the back compartment of Ike 's car . In getting this unlocked and satisfying Jimmy Gault , the British aide , that I actually had the General 's helmet , both of JIB were delayed momentarily in reaching the dock to board the Admiral 's barge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to return , having already started with the Supreme Commander and the Admiral , but someone had missed us . As we rather sheepishly joined the party , Ike said , " If you fellows want to go with me , get aboard of these boats ahead of me . " No comment from the bleachers . We headed first for the U , or UTAH Beach , where the 4th Division had been landed by naval forces under Admiral Moon . Later we found the Augusta , Admiral Kirk 's flagship , off OMAHA Beach , and shortly General Bradley , whom Ike was most anxious to see , and Admirals Kirk and Hall , who commanded U Force , came aboard . On OMAHA Beach , the 1st Division bad encountered the ill luck of running into the German 352nd Division , prisoners from which had disclosed that the division " happened " to be in that area on maneuvers . Landing had been slowed and landing craft sunk or shattered by mortar and field-artillery fire from well-concealed positions . The established gun emplacements had not caused trouble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been taken by the Rangers . We got back to Portsmouth at ten o'clock in the evening . On the way we saw several of the giant PHOENIXES being towed , as well as BOMBARDONS , the artificial breakwaters . The merchant ships to be sunk to form additional breakwaters were also there awaiting their fate , as soon as the waves abated . The ships are called " Corncobs . " Beetle Smith brought the press and radio representatives into the war room , where he explained the situation on the beachheads . We are already 12 to 24 hours behind in ( Continued on Page 631 MY THREE YEARS WITH EISENHOWER ( Continued f 2.5 ) unloading , and our margin of ground superiority over the enemy was all too little if we had been able to meet our schedule . However , the German build-up has not been quite so fast as expected , so perhaps the bad break of weather has n't been fatal . SHAER . Advance . Comotand Post , linear Poritunouthl , Sunday . Juno II . 1941 . Ike left the camp yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  no information from Monty , who had agreed to cable every night his latest impression of the progress of the battle . Weather took another bad turn . Ike was without information , and felt accordingly . First we knew he was going to the Main HQ. was when Tex Lee phoned to say the boss had arrived there . Ike 's overnight private signal from Monty had really arrived in camp during the night . But as it was in British . : ' ? her , it came to Jim Gault , who had teferred handling it until he got up at : ight . When Jim tried to unravel it , he found he needed help from a cipher officer . In the meantime , Ike had departed , but Jim phoned the gist to him around 10:00 and its content buoyed Ike . Monty reported things quite well indeed and had laid on an attack all along the line , which , if successful , would make our beachhead about 13 miles deep from the shore .

Last evening Churchill sent an important personal message to Ike . It said the Germans had sent a message to the southwest area of France asking whether Allied troops carried their gas masks with them or in baggage cars . The P. M. had been alarmed at this . Ike thought the message might be significant , in that use of gas would be a last-ditch effort of the Germans to stave off final defeat . We have lots on hand for counterattack if they start the dirty business . We got Carentan today . The Germans claimed they evacuated it , but we had practically surrounded the place , despite flooding . The push is going well all along the line . Fifth Corps with 1st and 29th divisions now have the widest beachhead . The British and Canadians are trying to by-pass Caen . SILtEF Main BWItlewinalh Tu000daT , , June 1:1. 191-1 . Ike went ashore in France yesterday for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was rapidly being bulldozed into usefulness . At General Bradley 's headquarters , recent operations were discussed . Lt. Col. Jim Gault , reporting on the trip , was impressed by the calm , confidence and competency of all commanders ; the speed with which artificial harbors had been started ; the absence of enemy planes , and the remarks of the troops who saw General Ike . " There 's Ike , " " General Ike , " and " The old man himself , " were prevalent throughout the day . When Ike returned , he was buoyant and inspired . The " cat 's " hold on our beachheads has become a panther 's claw . In any event , it is considerably larger . Last evening while playing bridge , I received a phone call from the Navy saying the British 7th Armored Division had taken Villers-Bocage , which was gratifying . We are still stuck around Caen , but on the American front and on the right flank of the British front we seem to be going apace . Ike said last night that in conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , he expected the younger men to take over the Army . Marshall said that Ike was a young man and " Why do you think we have been pushing you ? You will have ten years of hard work in the Army after the war . " All Ike could say then was that he hoped to have a six months ' rest . HIRAM/ Main1WidcwInal . Thursday . Juno 15. 191-1 . Last night Ike was concerned that Monty could n't attack until Saturday . Ike was anxious that the Germans be kept off balance and that our drive never stop . But apparently Monty wants to tidy up his " administrative tail " and get plenty of supplies on hand before be makes a general attack . Ike also said that yesterday we had made no gains , which he did n't like . De Gaulle was given permission to go to France yesterday on a French destroyer . But by the time he reached mid-Channel , he heard that in some French town which we had liberated they had been cheering for Giraud and in another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Gaulle felt was his . He threatened not to set foot on French soil under these conditions , but the result was merely a late cancellation by him of his luncheon engagement with General Montgomery . Ike had lunch yesterday with Lt. Gen. Sir Henry R. Pownall . Pownall told a story attributed to Ike which Ike repeated last night . Of course , it was n't true , but it seems that in Algiers an American and a British officer got into a severe argument which reached such proportions that General Eisenhower himself sent for the men and talked to them in the interests of unity . After giving both of them a lecture , he dismissed the British officer , but kept the American for further words : " I do n't mind your airing your differences with this British officer . I do n't particularly mind that you engaged in fisticutra with him . I must say that I think you were right in your position . While ordinarily I do n't condone cursing and name-calling , I forgive you for calling him a so-and-so . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so-and-so . Consequently , I am sending you home on a slow boat , unescorted . " WIdetvIna , Saturday . June 17. 111H . The 82nd Airborne and the 9th Infantry divisions pushed more than halfway across the Cherbourg Peninsula , taking St. Sauveur le Vicomte . But we are only holding our own around Caen . Monty had said he could not attack before Saturday , which , I presume , meant he would attack today . But so far we have heard nothing . We hear Cherbourg harbor is being blocked and facilities demolished . Ike received a letter today from Bradley , recommending that at least four more American divisions be hustled into the bridgehead . There are 16 German divisions in line against the entire bridgehead . SIIAEF ZWIalot ( WidcwIna1 , Tuesday . . luny 29. 19.11 .

As to the war in the beachhead , Monty again has delayed attack , largely because of weather , this time for 48 hours , making it due Thursday , Con t inued on Page 65 ) // ( Con l ' ? II Irons Page 63 ) June 22 . General Bradley , however , launched his push yesterday morning , first Cut across the Cherbourg Peninsula and is now expanding his thrust north and south , with prospect of capturing as many as 40,000 prisoners . We have been under the impression that Gen. " Jumbo " Wilson has a definite directive from the Combined Chiefs of Staff to launch an attack in Southern France at the earliest moment . But today he sent Ike a long message advocating hot pursuit of the Germans up the Italian leg and then across toward Austria . 511AEF Main IIVIdewinul . Wesinere 4112 : ** . June 21.19-11 . The persistence of bad weather is the major worry . This is the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practically ceased . Everyone takes more than the usual interest in weather these days , because of their intense personal concern in air attacks against the sites of the buzz bombs . They give no one satisfactory peace of mind . We have yet to receive the rockets . Ike was awakened during the night by an urgent phone message from the Prime Minister , who was upset because Admiral Stark had requested authority to withdraw the Nevada , Texas and Arkansas , battleships , the Tuscaloosa and Augusta , cruisers , 26 destroyers and assorted supporting craft , both transport and antiaircraft generally , by July 1 . The purpose of withdrawing the U. S. naval vessels was to send them to the Mediterranean to hasten Wilson 's " off again , on again , Finnegan " amphibious assault in Southern France . Admiral Ramsay , the naval C. in C. , had reported on the situation and " considered " that it would be unwise to withdraw the American battleships and heavy cruisers until the Cherbourg Peninsula is captured . During the day Ike sent a message to General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Admiral King not to withdraw his ships at this critical stage . SHALE Main0Widewinci.Thurailay , June 22 , 1911 . Today , Admiral Stark has been notified by telephone that release of the U. S. warships could not be agreed pending the outcome of conferences with General Wilson 's Chief of Staff . However , American troops have reached the outer defenses of Cherbourg , where the harbor is being systematically damaged . SUMO , Main IMideveinal , NrillaYJum , 23 , 11111 . If the OVERLORD landings had been delayed two weeks , which would have been the necessary period of deferment if Ike had n't given the word to go , we would have hit the worst weather in 20 years , according to a report of our chief meteorological officer , Group Capt . J. M. Stagg . During the period June 17 to 21 , into which the two-week postponement would have fallen , the sky was completely overcast , with base about 2000 feet , and the wind was mainly northwest , with a force of 4 to 5 on the 17th , but 6 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when it blew from a northeasterly direction . On St.agg 's memo about the weather situation , Ike wrote in longhand : " Thanks , and thank the gods of war we went when we did ! ? D. E. " SHALE Main Mildewing ? , Sunday , June 25 , 1911 . Failure of air-ground co-operation always riles tempers , and , I notice , is one of the things Ike has almost continually to police with understanding and firmness . When he talks with the ground commanders , he emphasizes the need of their learning the problems of the Air Force and the limitations of air power as applied to ground operations . When he talks with commanders of air units , he emphasizes the problems of the ground commander and asks that the Air Force study every possibility of assisting their compatriots on the ground  --  preferably without killing them in the effort . SHALE Main i-Widevvindl , T1114111111Y . June 27.111-11 . Ike finally got over to France on Saturday and visited in the American sector . He wanted to make certain that after the capture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army to the south and smash into the Germans to prevent the peninsula from being sealed . Monty 's attack started on Sunday morning , the 25th , but so far we have had little concrete information about it . He waited so long that at least two additional Panzer divisions faced him . In addition , the ten or twelve day delay gave the Germans an opportunity to dig in and get set , whereas Bradley kept his fellows moving and the Germans never had much chance to dig in . Upon request of General Gale , Ike 's Chief British Administrative Officer for SHAEF , I am leaving tonight for Cherbourg and vicinity to get informal answers to a number of questions as to the condition of the port and railroad serving it . Ike is considerably less than exuberant . He did n't even seem to get a kick out of the fall of Cherbourg . The pool correspondents have been in to see me at the Advance C. P. and I told them that if I were writing a story on Ike 's activity of the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather and the fact that he may be looking at one battle , but is thinking ahead weeks and months . When Bizerte and Tunis fell , Ike registered practically no exultation ; it was something he bad already counted on weeks before as an accomplishment . Just now he is concerned about slowness of Monty 's attack , the build-up and Bradley 's attack to the south . SHAM , ' Main IM idewinei . Sal arday , July1,191-1 . Two years ago today I arrived in England . When I returned from Cherbourg I found Ike in fine fettle . He envied me my gypsy trips and said I see and hear much more than he , and do n't have to worry about causing inconveniences to my hosts . He was hoping to get over to France again , but was concerned about the effect of the flying bombs on morale ; not so much personally as their cumulative damage . The P. M. had expressed grave concern and had said there had been 1600 to date . Ike regretted that Bradley had to postpone his big attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned to strike Friday , June 30 , but the attack was postponed until Monday . General Marshall advised Ike on June 28 that President Roosevelt had concurred completely in the stand of the U. S. Chiefs in favor of the southern invasion of France and is opposed to the proposal to use all our Mediterranean forces to fight on into Northern Italy and beyond . He basso notified the Prime Minister , and hopes there will not be a deadlock in the Combined Chiefs . He insists that both he and the Prime Minister should support General Ike . I happened to be in General Ike 's office when the P. M. phoned him . It now appears that Mr. Churchill will cable the President today , agreeing to the southern invasion , and that General Wilson will be given a clear-cut directive to attack as quickly as possible . Ike was delighted with the P. M. 's indicated approval . In his phone conversation , Ike had insisted that he needed an additional big port into which to pour American divisions now awaiting action at home . By getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces could he augmented by perhaps 12 divisions more than presently scheduled . The P. M. said it was a fateful decision . A hard-fought battle around Caen employing tanks has been in progress , one of the reports from Monty saying that some 300 German tanks have been destroyed . 511:1LEF Main ( Witlewinel . TueralaY .

Yesterday we received he formal directive from the Combined Chiefs of ( Curls inner on Page 671 // ( Continued front Page 65 ) Staffordering General Wilson to launch ANVIL , by August 15 . Bradley started his drive in the base of the Cherbourg Peninsula toward Coutancea . First reports indicate satisfactory gains . Monty has issued a directive saying it is his policy to " contain " German armor around Caen on the left front of the beachhead , so the Americans on the right would not be bothered too much while taking Cherbourg .

At Headquarters , we have taken to shelter eight times today . Today , Dr. Daniel P. O'Brien , of the Rockefeller Foundation , had lunch with us . O'Brien said scientists working for the Allies now are earnestly experimenting on uranium by bombarding its atoms . The result was that 40 or 50 pounds of the stuff may destroy a large city . He said Swedish scientists had told him recently that they doubted if the Germans had got as far on development of uranium as British and American researchers . SIIAEF Main 1Widew1rsul . Friday . July 7. , 1944 . Ike returned from France on Wednesday the 5th . His effort to keep secret that he had flown in a Mustang over the German lines had failed miserably  --  but rightly . He had gone to the field only to find " 50 photographers , newsreel men and reporters . " During his extended visit to the beachhead , Ike had visited the 7th and Sth corps and their divisions , trying to catch them during actual operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 4th . They found the going extremely tough . One of the things Ike learned firsthand was the inadequacy of fire power of American tanks against Tigers and Panthers . He set all hands to work by a special message to Beetle while he was in Normandy , and today had " all hands on deck . " The result was a special letter to General Marshall , carried by Brig . Gen. Joseph A. Holly in person . Holly is a tank expert who said he had made six trips across the Atlantic in the last six months dealing with this and related problems . Monty 's first eloquent directive called for an all-out slash on the British front to take Caen . The second said this effort was a holding operation to contain the German Army , while the Americans took Cherbourg and resumed their push southward . Ike has been smoldering , and today burst out with a letter to Monty , which , in effect , urges him to avoid having our forces sealed into the beachhead , to take the offensive , and Ike would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to say this . I think Monty is characteristically supercautious , but when he gets everything " tidy " he will hit . . and hard . George Allen , our friend of the Red Cross , has been visiting us since Ike returned . Night before last , George asked Ike in what state he was born . Ike carefully explained he was born in Texas , at Denison , because his father had to move from Abilene , Kansas , to Denison to find employment in railroad work , and subsequently had moved to Tyler , Texas , and then had returned to Abilene , when Ike was two years of age . " A chicken may hatch her eggs in the oven , but they 're still not biscuits , " Ike said , and George roared . Yesterday Ike had a letter from a British civilian complaining that the American press was unfair to the British military effort , because Americans play up the efforts of Americans . Yet the B.B.C. generally speaks of " RAF " bombing operations , and if they are U. S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This is noticeable to all Americans . Compared to the spirit of the British and American troops , who fight side by side , that of the newspapers and radio in our respective countries frequently appeared to us to be un-Allied because it is natural for press or radio to carry stories of the greatest interest to its particular readers or listeners . SHAEF Forward Ill'ortamoulh ? , Monday . . July 10.1914 . Ike , Warrant Officer Rae , Mickey and I arrived at the Advance C. P. yesterday . En route , the General and I stopped at Chequers , where Ike had an hour-anda-half talk with Churchill , who was resting in his bedroom . Ike told me later the P. M. " gave him hell " for insisting on the ANVIL operation , Churchill still being wedded to pursuit of the Germans in Italy , and to possibilities in the Balkans . I had given Ike one of the German cigars I picked up in a disheveled headquarters in Cherbourg . He gave it to the P. M. When Churchill and Ike came downstairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the original box with a few more in it , which I gave him . He seemed pleased . I found , when we reached camp , that Ike 's shoulder bursitis , once repaired by the surgeon , again was kicking up . Late in the evening , I visited the War Room at SHAEF Forward to get news for the General . I found that Caen had been practically taken . With this as a nightcap , Ike went off to sleep . Americans on the western flank had taken La Haye du Puits and , in the center , the 30th Division of the 19th Corps had gained about a mile and a half . It looks as if we are on the march at last . Red Mueller , of N.B.C. , who is working on a story about the General , asked me for some anecdotes .

This afternoon Ike ' called me into his office and handed me a sheet of note paper on which he had scribbled a message . He said he had found it in his wallet . After reading it , I told him I wanted it . He reluctantly assented , saying that he had written one in similar vein before every amphibious operation , but had secretly torn up each one . The note : Our landings in the Cherbourg-Havre area have failed to gain a satisfactory foothold and I have withdrawn the troops .

Monty wants all-out air support for a big offensive which starts Saturday on the eastern flank and Monday on the west , weather permitting . Said the Normandy battle front would be " aflame , " He also asked for a tighter ban on visitors . Ike received word , after this morning 's meeting at SHAEF Forward , that Gen. Teddy Roosevelt , assistant commander of the 4th Division , had died in France of a heart attack overnight . Teddy was to have been given command of the 90th Division tomorrow . Ike said he had absolutely vitalized the 4th Division , and the division was crazy about him . SUM:1P slain ( Widowing ) . Monday . July-17.1911 . Gen. " Whitey " McNair has reported here for duty .

Monty 's attack with three armored divisions south and east of Caen got off to a good start yesterday , some seven miles having been gained by noon and the bulk of enemy 's defenses penetrated . The RAF had dropped a concentration of 7000 tons of bombs to help the ground troops break through . Around evening , Tedder called Ike and said Monty had , in effect , stopped his armor from going farther . Ike was mad . Monty always wants to wait to draw up his " administrative tail . " The Americans got St. LO , taken in fighting from hedgerow to hedgerow and settled in the streets . Ike has told Monty of his effort to protect him from visitors ; Ike having had a long discussion with the P. M. on the secret phone this morning . Ike had sent word yesterday that the P.

Ike took all the responsibility . After explaining his desire not to bother Monty , the trip was laid on for to morrow , with the Old Boy permitted to visit in thereat areas and not to bother Monty or other combat officers at all . SHAER Forward Morictinouthl , Thursday . July 20 , 1941 . Lam. evening Air Marshal Tedder phoned Ike and , reflecting the disappointment of the Air at the slowness on the ground , said the British Chiefs of Staff would support any recommendation that Ike might care to make , with respect to Monty , for not succeeding in going places with his big three-armoreddivision push .

The Air people are completely disgusted with the lack of progress . Anyway , Ike is off today to see Bradley and Monty . It 's now 10:00 . Ike is standing around crunching the cinders with his beets , impatiently waiting for weather news and clearance for the cross-Channel flight . Ike has just said he 's got to get across if he has to swim . He is like a blind dog in a meat house  --  he can smell it , but he ca n't find Sit .

Today we still have rain , and have had all night , so presumably that push has to be postponed again .

Ike visited Monty and Bradley late Thursday , reaching here about 7:00 last evening , Friday the 21st . Yesterday he sent a letter to Monty . It recapitulates to Monty the gist of Ike 's talk with him on Thursday . The theme is that military necessity dictates that Montgomery push on with every ounce of strength and zeal . Telek , our Scotty , got out of quarantine yesterday , and surprisingly remembered his old tricks , such as chasing his tail , curling over on his beckon the slightest chance that someone would rub his belly , and in general showing his inimitable signs of independence .

He figured the Germans had about the same , which is unusual for the defending force , and attributable to our superiority in air and artillery . He also thought the Germans would get stretched in defending their outer defense lines in Russia , Italy and France to a point where they could no longer supply reinforcements Then would come the opportunity for a break-through on a major scale .

Then Monty 's Chief of Staff phoned Ike to assure him that Monty had " fattened up " the attack , and that one was on today in the British sector , as well as in the American . Ike said he had started to be alarmed at Monty 's hesitance ten days ago , had confided in Tedder his fears , and now Tedder is just reaching the phase of irritation in which Ike found himself several days ago . Yesterday I told British Col. Jim Gault a story which originated with that inimitable radio character , Arthur Godfrey . Art hur has become a cook , it seems , and has a favorite recipe . Take a good piece of beef for roasting , pour over it a quart of Scotch , then a bottle of vermouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oven . " The roast may not be any good , " said Art , " but oh , baby ! What gravy ? " This morning at breakfast , Jim said the best laugh of the current period was my story , the whip line of which he recalled as : " What excellent sauce it makes ! " Tedder phoned Ike this morning , and was coming down this afternoon to pursue his currently favorite subject , the slowness of Monty . But Ike told him he had talked with Churchill , and the P. M. was satisfied , and Tedder rather uh-huhed , being not at all satisfied . He implied Winston must have sold Ike a bill of goods . Anyway , Ike said he had had this sort of thing happen before , and had worked out things satisfactorily all around , and would this one in time  --  to which can be added that there 's nothing so wrong that a good victory wo n't cure .

During the evening , Bradley phoned Beetle the further news that Gen. Whitey McNair had been killed at a forward observation post watching the spectacle , probably by a " short . " Ike was very depressed . But the other news Bradley phoned brought smiles of satisfaction to both Ike and Beetle , who happened to be in Ike 's caravan when I carried in the information . It was that the 9th had gained 2300 yards from the starting point ; the 4th , 1200 , and the 30th , 1300 . This did n't seem much , but represented a considerable advance since early afternoon  --  the attack started at 11:00 wert. ? so Ike felt much better . After I had got to sleep about 11:30 last night , No. 10 Downing phoned , Churchill again wanting to speak to Ike , " if he is n't asleep . ' Found Ike still awake . He told Churchill that Monty now saw eye to eye with him and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , with hard fighting under way , and much more in prospect . The P.
