" There is a general and valid acknowledgment that the better the painter the dumber he must be , and out of this dumbness the critic is born and makes hay . " French-born Jean Chariot , who wrote that bitter-seeming remark , is himself a cheerful contradiction of it . Chariot ( rhymes with Hello ) makes hay on both sides of the field . Last week his paintings and colored lithographs were packing people in at Colorado Springs 's George Nix Gallery ( including museum buyers from as far away as Washington , D.C. and San Diego ) , while Chariot himself expatiated on art in the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center School ( which he directs ) and put the finishing touches on his latest critical work-a history of Mexican mural painting . <P> Teamwork v. Originality . At 50 , Charlot has behind him a career that includes Montmartre as well as Mexico City , and a 700-sq. - ft. mural at the University of Georgia . <P> The chief contribution that the Mexican muralists ( Orozco , Siqueiros and Rivera ) made to modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " painting , simple and clear in theme , instead of individual expression . " Perhaps , " he says , " Mexico will point Europe back to the forgotten way . " In Colorado , Charlot has put his own students to work on a gigantic fresco of the fall of Jericho , to " keep them , out of mischief for months at a time , and help them understand that teamwork is important and that originality is not all-important . " <P> Contemplation v. Fishing . Chariot 's own work , nonetheless , is strikingly original . His new paintings were mostly religious in theme , though they transferred the Biblical settings to Mexico. * Given Chariot 's Mexican materials , a lesser artist would have done something picturesque , suitable for pious tourists , but Chariot 's pictures were more than halfway abstract : the figures were squared off to look like pottery dolls and the colors were arbitrarily rich and sweet . <P> If his art reflected nothing of the scholarly complexity of Chariot 's mind , it did reflect the simplicity of his life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife and four children . Chariot 's wife , Zohmah , is a trim , dark lady who was raised in Brigham City , Utah , and abandoned the name of Dorothy Day after getting acquainted with Mexico as an art student . " When I married Jean , " she confesses , " I thought ' I 'm going to be an intellectual , ' but instead he 's taught me to read detective stories . " <P> Chariot is content to stay within the few blocks that hold the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center , a Roman Catholic Church , and his white frame house on Boulder Crescent . Colorado has , of course , other attractions for Chariot . " Since I came to this outdoor-loving land , " says he , " I am engaging in contemplating fishing . That is to say , I am contemplating it . " <P> <P> * An earlier example , a Chariot painting of the Nativity , appeared as TIME 'S Christmas cover in 1939.                @ @ @ @ @
