Venezuela was agog last week over tales of marvelous amphibian boat-trucks that will open up the heretofore impenetrable reaches of the Orinoco and Amazon rivers . <P> These specially designed combination carriers can operate in shallow water , climb over rocks and rapids , slither up &; down river banks to take cargo . They are expected to bring the jungles within quick and easy distance of civilization by utilizing South America 's unrivaled network of tropical rivers instead of expensive highways and railroads . <P> Prophet and high priest of this new vision is Dudley P. South , research engineer of Higgins Industries Inc. , whose torpedo boats and tank-carrying invasion boats are already important United Nations weapons ( TIME , May 4 ) . Within four or five weeks Dudley South expects to have a few experimental models of Higgins ' new boat-trucks to play with up &; down the Orinoco , in the hope of developing them for big-time passenger and freight use when peace comes . <P> But Texan South 's immediate wartime job is to get rubber out of the dense forests of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new version of Higgins ' famed Eureka boat especially built for jungle rivers . Already he has 25 of these boats ready to go . They will cut down the time from Puerto Ayacucho to Ciudad Bolivar from a hazardous ten days by canoe to 24 hours by Eureka-and carry a hundred times as much each trip .
