ONE of the surprises of the war has been the ability of American fighting ships to keep at sea for previously unheard-of periods of time . Today , the United States Navy practically carries its own ports and harbors with it . This is not an impromptu miracle . American naval chiefs have worked for two generations for a fleet that could outcruise all others . Admirals of an earlier epoch would be astounded , however , at the mighty organization of floating machine shops , tankers and other auxiliaries which make a United States naval base out of the PacifiC Ocean . One important factor in this development has been the introduction , by William Francis Gibbs , of New York , of improved machinery which enables American ships to travel faster and farther on a given amount of fuel . Gibbs has been hailed in speeches by Rear Admiral Harold G. Bowen , former engineering chief of the Navy , as " the greatest influence on naval design since John Ericsson " ? Ericsson being the roan who started a new chapter in naval history in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the headlong career of the Confederate ironclad Merrimac in the historic duel in Hampton Roads . American naval design stands higher today than it has since the clipper-ship days when it led the world , and the Navy gives much credit to Gibbs . British naval officers , incidentally , are among the heartiest admirers of the new machinery in American warships . Gibbs and his staff have evolved the working plans for more than $12,000,000,000 worth of ships America has built or is building . He is the father of mass shipbuilding . According to one naval officer , the enormous expansion of American sea power is due to three factors ? " the Navy , American industry and Gibbs , " Gibbs is not exactly an inventor . He merely takes hold of things and improves them . Finding that ship machinery had failed to keep pace with land 9 machinery , he took ideas from great electrical-power plants and put them into ships . Finding shipbuilding a slow , tailor-made process , he worked out rapid-fire methods . Before we entered the war , he designed the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wholesale scale . Henry J. Kaiser made his debut as a ship constructor by doing part of this job . Gibbs next designed the Liberty ships and helped to produce them rapidly . His craftsmanship and high-speed methods have been applied to cruisers , carriers , destroyers , auxiliaries , landing craft and icebreakers . Gibbs decided back in 1936 that war was inevitable . His engineering mind reduced the situation to a sort of mathematical formula  --  Appeasement equals War . He began to enlarge his staff of engineers , research men and shipbuilding specialists into an organization that could tackle and solve any problem that the Navy could think op . Gibbs is fifty-eight years old , and most of his life has been a fight . He picked an unpromising career for himself when he set out to design great ships for a country that was n't interested in ships . In order to make any sort of impression as an independent naval architect , he had to introduce radical innovations . As usual in the case of a man with new ideas , he had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He never studied ship design at school . After majoring in economise , he took a degree in law . He is entirely self-educated as a naval architect and engineer . His interest in ship design started as a hobby and grew into a mania . He began to steep himself in sea lore as soon as he could read , and has grown more enthusiastic about the subject every year for half a century . Designing ships is his sport , recreation , business and religion . His drawing board has been a combination of high altar and roulette layout . He has gambled his entire future again and again on new ideas of ship making , and is ready to keep on playing double-or-nothing as long as he can discover new ideas . Gibbs ' boyhood hero was Isambard Kingdom Brunel , who , in 1858 , built the Great Eastern , which laid the Atlantic cable . The Great Eastern was a 19,000-tonner , approximately three times the size of its largest predecessor . It was the most-discussed ship since Noah 's Ark , but e white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gibbs grew up with a big-ship imagination . In 1916 he designed his first ship , a 55,000-tun liner , larger than any then in existence , but Part I of the World War caused the project to be shelved . One trouble with the Great Eastern was that there was no machinery in its day to propel it efficiently . This started Gibbs on a lifelong quest for machinery that would make ships move faster and farther on less fuel . The giant ships of his imagination remained unbuilt , but the success of his quest-for better machinery has been brilliantly demonstrated in this war . Gibbs has two well-known nicknames ? " Sir Francis " and " the undertaker . " He used to be familiarly referred to as " the parvenu , " because some people regarded him as an upstart and interloper in the field of warship design . He is six feet two and a half inches tall , leaner than Cassius , with a dead-white , deeply lined face , thinning gray hair , and scrutinizing , appraising eyes behind silver-rimmed glassee . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a damned disinheriting countenance , " discouraging to superfluous conversation . He got the name of " the undertaker " because he used to wear nothing but black clothes and a black batwing tie . He dressed that way on engineering principles . By always wearing black , he never had to waste time and thought on which tie to wear with which suit . The same brain cells which caused him to simplify his attire and use standardized , interchangeable items of dress were probably responsible for one of his greatest war achievements  --  his system of producing great numbers of simplified ships with standardized , interchangeable parts . His manners are based on engineering principles . He has no more use for ceremony than a destroyer has for silk sails . His conversation is designed for speed . He has a good command of rough language , which sometimes makes for efficiency and economy by putting an end to polite small talk . He rather defends disagreeableness as a technique for getting things accomplished . When a young man , he saw many of his good ideas put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More than once , he found the path of progress stopped up by important but obsolete men , and he was too polite to do anything about it . About twenty years ago ; he discovered the invaluable secret of disagreeableness . It caused people , who might otherwise have ignored him , to think " This fellow is PHOTOGRAPHY BY LARRY KEIGHLEY so brusque that he must be right . " It won enemies but it influenced people . When somebody complained to Admiral Bowen about Gibbs ' genius for lacerating egos , the admiral replied , " The Navy is n't hiring an entertainer . It 's hiring a man for his brains . " One of the three leading ahipbuilders who believed in Gibbs and adopted his ideas for destroyers in 1933 was William S. Newell , of the Bath Iron Works . Newell has described how he was advised against this step by people who regarded it a dangerous experiment . At a gathering of naval constructors , Newell was presented with a cartoon , showing him in black clothes , with black gloves and a black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made over into a grim , ascetic , fanatic countenance . Under the cartoon the line read : " You 've gone around with him so much , you 've begun to look like him . " When Gibbs has time for amusement , his amusements usually have an engineering character . He is fond of certain symphonies which he regards as masterpieces of design . Hearing Bach 's music , according to Gibbs , is like looking through glass at magnificent ship machinery in action . He is enthusiastic about juggling acts , because of their devotion to balance and symmetry . Juggling and ship designing have much in common , as each is a difficult business of keeping six or seven elements in perfect relationship , with danger of disaster if any one element gets out of harmony with the others . When Gibbs is in Washington , he usually tries to find time to go to the National Art . Gallery for the exhilaration which he gets from the design of the building  --  the world 's finest architectural work , in his opinion . The big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an enormous desk , a swivel chair and four telephone &; Gibbs has no private office , no desk , no swivel chair and one telephone . Only two of his 3000 employees have private offices , and they have no right to them . One executive seized a private office which had been maintained for Navy visitors , and has resisted all efforts to oust him . Another grabbed a conference room , on the pretext that he needed privacy in talking over embarrassing personal problems with employees . These two private-office prima donnas are regarded as nervous cases by the rest of the organization . The other department heads have no more use for private offices than John McGraw would have had when he was on the field bossing the Giants and baiting umpires . They are out in the open , surrounded by their staffs , in a bustling , noisy atmosphere . Instead of using buzzers and flying squadrons of secretaries , they establish communications by calling across the floor . If a man is n't handy , he is paged all over the building at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no soundproof chamber of meditation . A few years ago it might . have been compared to a newspaper office , but today newspaper offices are becoming honeycombed with little private brain shelters and stroke-of-genius rooms . The spot occupied by Gibbs at the headquarters of his firm , Gibbs &; Cox , Inc. , on the New York water front at 21 West Street , is the most public place in the institution . Few of his employees call up his secretaries to find out whether he is busy or not . They simply go where he is and interrupt him . Instead of a dealt , Gibbs has a drawing board . Instead of a swivel chair , he has four high stools . There is usually a blueprint ten or twelve feet long on the drawing board , and he has four stools so that he can move from one to another as he works on different parts of a design . When he dictates , a secretary perches on one of the adjoining stools . Anybody who wants to talk to Gibbs is at liberty to interrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is the great public fountain of information in the establishment , and to keep information flowing rapidly is the most important part of his business today . His rule is that no employee is to be retarded in his work by delay in getting facts or in gutting a decision . Gibbs has trained himself for years to stop in the middle of a sentence , hold a conversation and then resume dictating where he left off . The place sometimes looks like the box office of a Broadway hit because of the line of men and women waiting to talk to him . The Gibbs method is identical with that of the late Boss Murphy , of Tammany Hall , who used to converse in a " privately public " manner with a long chain of district lenders , jobholders and job seekers , usually polishing off each men in a few seconds . Sometimes a man polished off Murphy , and the some thing has happened to Gibbs . He has so impressed his blunt personality on his staff that he receives a good deal of blunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be told that some of his suggestions are wild or fan- ' tastic . There is a curious paradox in the Gibbs organization . Every department head is a slightly limited monarch of all he surveys . Complete authority is delegated to him to handle any job entrusted to him . The less he talks to Gibbs about it , the better . But every employee is free to go to Gibbs over anybody 's head . All sorts of troubles are poured into his ear . He is likely to get a firsthand account of it . if a typist feels that her temperament does n't harmonize with that of her immediate superior or her coworkers . In these matters he is not exactly a court of appeals , but a sort of Dutch uncle to the whole establishment . He is good at washing up office troubles . He does n't use the fine art of disagreeableness in this branch of his work . The only time he really gets soft , however , is when he is talking about his ships . Gibbs handled all the office troubles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he sticks to that job today when he has more than 3000 . He is sensitive to the mood and atmosphere of the shop , and tries to remove any friction that tends to lessen enthusiasm . His office hours are eight A.M. to six P.M. , with time out for tea and toast . He also works nights and Sundays . Plans for more than 4500 ships , totaling over 6,000 , - 000 tons on naval vessels and 23,500,000 tons of merchant ships , have passed over the Gibbs drawing board . He brought the Rocky Mountains and the Great Plaine into the business of building them . Texas blacksmiths and Idaho machinists make parts for the " Gibbs fleet . " He has drawn more than 2000 firms , ranging from fishing-tackle makers to organ builders , into the shipbuilding industry . Most of the blueprints that pass over Gibbs ' drawing board today are the translation of battle experience into improvements on ships now under construction . Every landing on a new beach brings a flood of recommendations for changes in landing craft . After being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Gibbs to be grafted with all possible haste upon half-built craft in shipyards . The incessant demand for changes is one of the worst headaches of shipbuilders . In n discussion before a congressional committee on these changed and delays , Gibbs said , " The question is , ' Do you want a good boat or a prompt one ? ' " . One congressman said that changes in design on partly built ships meant a " Government loss . " Gibbs replied , " It is n't a Government loss if you win a battle with the ship . " Today . Gibbs has the greatest private design office and procurement office in the history of shipbuilding . His plans and research ( Continued on Page 37 ) THE MYSTERIOUS MR . GIBBS ' Continued from Page 11 ) data go to eighty shipyards . He sends out more than two acres of blueprints a day and more than 300,000 letter sheets of data and instructions . He places orders for more than 32,000,000 worth of materials a day . His post-office bill averages between $600 and $700 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in naval engineering and architecture , Gibbs is back in the old sailing-vessel days in one respect . He has no press agent . He testified under oath last May that his firm had never issued a line of copy to the press . He has clung passionately to personal obscurity . Gibbs left his titudiesat Harvard in 1910 . During the 30 's , he came along with his new machinery , which has been rated by some authorities as the greatest step forward in navigation since steam superseded sails . But his Harvard class-book , printed in 1940 , sets forth his career in these words : " Gibbs has not been heard from . " Last summer , the company issued to its employees an illustrated pamphlet , describing some 40,000,000 tons of sea power bearing the Gibbs stamp . Any firm with a press agent would have released this to every newspaper in the United States , together with full-page photographic layouts . Gibbs , on the contrary , practically threatened to prosecute anybody who gave his organization a mention . The pamphlet leads off as follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Inc . This book or parts thereof may not be reproduced in any form without permission of Gibbs &; Cox , Inc . " His antipublicity policy was partly justified by results , Except for two or three things , his career might have been cited as evidence that the whole press-agent profession is a mistake . But the seamy side of anonymity became apparent when draft boards began to seize some of his essential workers . The fact that an individual was a key man in the Gibbs &; Cox organization meant nothing to draft boards . They had never heard of Gibbs &; Cox , The development of elaborate and exact ship models is one of Gibbs ' most important contributions to mass production . Minute errors in blueprints are detected by the model makers , and this prevents costly errors in actual construction . But a draft board grabbed one of the master model makers , a man of unique talent . The board regarded this artist as nonessential . Gibbs ' business has been looked into by everything from the FBI to the House Committee on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who he was . Congressmen and others were inclined to think that there was something surreptitious about a man who did n't have a press agent . The general belief is that nobody except burglars dodges the limelight in this enlightened age . It did n't look right for an unknown to move noiselessly into a unique relationship with the United States Navy . It was very odd to find America 's No. 1 Man of Mystery in the center of a $12,000,000,000 program . A few congressmen were suffering a hang-over from the days when men in the armament industry were the head devils of the international scene . There were still echoes of the old speeches about " the munitions kings , " " the armament barons , " " the merchants of death " and " the coiners of blood . " Gibbs was the ideal villain of the old munitions melodrama because of the size of his operations and the inexplicable lack of publicity concerning them . The attitude of some of the investigators indicated the belief that they had discovered a hundred extra-sinister Sir Basil Zaharoffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee on Naval Affairs of the House of Representatives last May , one congressman described Gibbs as a " guardian " whom the Navy had appointed for itself . He asserted that the Navy had " designated an outsider " to do the Navy 's work " for enormous fees . " " ' You admit to the public , as far as I see it , " the congressman said to an admiral , " that you are not able or competent to do the job yourself , when you have all the resources of the country . " ( Continued on Page 39 ) . ( Continued from Page 37 ) However , the testimony did not support the view that Gibbs was a " guardian " of the Navy . He was rather a " discovery " of the Navy , which sought for all the outside brains and talent it could find to drive its building program ahead . Rear Admiral E. W. Mills testified , " I really think that Gibbs and Cox , as a firm of naval architects and engineers , have probably contributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other single force or agency . " Rear Admiral E. L. Cochrane , chief of the Bureau of Ships , testified , The progress which has been achieved in our shipbuilding program  --  particularly in those types which have been required in large numbers in multiple programs , such as destroyers , escorts , LST 's , LSM 's  --  would have been utterly impossible had it not been for services such as those that have been furnished by Gibbs and Cox . " Admiral Cochrane added that the Gibbs firm " is a unique organization , and there is nothing equal to it in the field of marine engineering and naval construction . " At the end of the committee hearing , which had started in a somewhat hostile atmosphere , Chairman Vinson offered his congratulations to the Navy for having had the " vision " to use the talents of Gibbs so lavishly . All eight investigations turned out favorably to Gibbs . Gibbs has professed gratitude for the investigations , although they took up more than 50 per cent of his time in the last year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " like being forced to look up the answer to every possible question that can be asked about his business . " Gibbs is not " the guardian " of the Navy . The Navy has dictated the fighting characteristics of every Navy ship he has worked on . The Navy makes the design ; Gibbs translates it into working plans for the use of the shipyards . The main ideas of the big landing craft , for example , were handed to Gibbs by the Navy . His job was to supply research , experiment and engineering imagination necessary for this great adventure in amphibious warfare . The division of labor between the Navy and Gibbs is illustrated by one of the minor strokes of genius of the war  --  the method of transporting 225-ton landing craft pickaback across the ocean on landing ships . The Navy had the inspiration , but it called on Gibbs for the technical brains to make it work . The 225-ton craft , which are built on inland waterways , make the trip down the Mississippi and along the coast on their own power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own power . Formerly , they were split up into three sections . loaded on Liberty ships and reassembled on the other side of the ocean . This was costly in time and cargo space , and the Navy hit on the pickaback scheme . It was an easy matter to lift the 225-ton boat with a huge crane and place it on the deck of the big landing ship . But launching it was another matter . The Gibbs staff carried on experiments at Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey with models , one three feet long and one a foot and a half long . The friction involved in sliding 225-ton craft over the larger ship 's deck could not be calculated exactly . It was worked out successfully , however , by general reasoning and by sliding weights over brushes of fine wire . From the laboratory work , it was decided that the big ship should be tilted over fourteen degrees by pumping water into ballast tanks on one side . The first trial launching with the full-sized ship was a success . The smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alight bump on the mother ship . Since then , even the slight bump has been eliminated . The new technique was immediately put into use , with enormous saving of time and labor over the earlier take-apart-put-together method . Another illustration of the place occupied by Gibbs in the war picture is a stroke of genius by the United States Coast Guard which was translated into ( Conti ttttttt on Page 41 ) 2 I 'd gotten on at midnight , and hardly t &; noticed him then . I must have fallen asleep quickly , ' cause the next ( Continued learn Page 39 ) a smooth technical job by Gibbs and his lieutenants . Improved icebreakers were desperately needed to open up icebound Arctic ports in winter . The Coast Guard worked up a combination of ideas to be embodied in a super-icebreaker . Gibbs turned out a singular 6600-ton monster which is said to have more engineering in it than any other surface ship ever built . It has made a speed of more than four knots through ice more than four feet thick . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven times the best speed ever recorded by icebreakers of the older type . It can wriggle , buck and perform practically every trick of a Turkish wrestler for breaking any hold that the freezing Arctic can take on it . It is capable of making a mere clambake or Elks ' excursion out of an expedition to the North Pole . The early icebreakers used to ram the ice . They would square off , bump the ice , withdraw and bump it again , like a fullback hitting the line for small gains . A later type of icebreaker leaned a heavy prow on the ice . This proved more effective than ramming . A still later development was the creation of an artificial stream under the ice by means of a special propeller under the bow . This was used successfully by the Ann Arbor Railroad in an icebreaker in Lake Michigan . The Russians , who have had more experience with icebreakers than any other nation , tried out the " artificial river " idea , but discarded it as ineffecti ve against ice of great thickness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guard-Gibbs boat . There was no way of testing the idea with models or with labTHEY SAVED THE CHILDREN ( Conan ued from . Page 94 ) For once a child was registered as Jewish , his life was in danger . As they had done in all occupied countries , the Nazis had set up in France an organization which attempted to register the entire Jewish community . Then the extermination could proceed systematically , with SS men calling upon the listed addresses to fill the periodic deportation quotas , as a train with 1200 capacity left approximately every fifteen days for the east . The Nazi organization for the Jews was called Union Generale des Israelites de France , or UGIF ; it was staffed by Jews , many of whom hoped , by working within the German structure , to be able to help their own people . The UGIF was a trap into which the poor Jews almost inevitably had to fall . For , as their funds and businesses were confiscated , as they were driven from their professions and as family breadwinners were deported , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This could be obtained only through the UGIF ; and once they were enrolled they were doomed . When a family 's quota time came , SS men would appear at the house ; they would know the number of children in the family , and would calmly wait for the children to return from school , while the distracted mother tried to think of some subterfuge , some way to warn the children not to come home . Once the family was in custody , the parents would be taken to the big , cold detention barracks at the edge of town  --  the dreaded Drancy . The children would usually be separated from the parents and placed in one of the Jewish children 's homes which the Nazis had taken over .

They had to be kidnaped. oratory apparatus , but the American engineers became convinced that the artificial-river principle would work if the " river " was strong enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove a stream ahead under the ice with an initial speed of 1750 feet a minute , or twenty miles an hour  --  a velocity which no river ever attained except at Niagara or some other great fall . While rapidly losing its initial velocity , the artificial river plunged ahead like a mountain torrent for a sufficient distance to cut the props out from under the ice sheet . With its prow heavily weighted by water ballast , the icebreaker has sliced its way through ice ten feet thick . The Coast Guard-Gibbs icebreaker has a side-to-side roll and fore-and-aft plunge which are produced by quick shifts of water ballast . With the help of powerful pumping machinery and a twenty-four-inch pipe , the icebreaker can throw 226 tons of water from the starboard ballast tanks to the port ballast tanks , or vice versa , in seventy-five seconds . Ice is melted by pressure as well as heat , and the rapidly rolling ship is able to produce an artificial thaw along its hull . To disengage the ship from ice under certain conditions , water is pumped back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , giving the fore-and-aft plunge . Among other devices new to the history of navigation , the icebreaker has a niche , or pocket , called the " hotbox , " in its hull near the keel . This is an ingenious device to overcome one of the weaknesses of icebreakers in the past . Sea water freezes at twenty-eight degrees .

Mouchon belonged was known as the CIMADE. the Comite d ' Inter-Mouvemeat auprhs des Evacuees . The executive secretary , Mlle.

It may chill the engine until it ceases to function . Another difficulty is that the strainer through which water is drawn into the cooling system freezes over , putting the cooling system out of action . When this happens , the engine has to be shut off instantly or it may be ruined . Other icebreakers have been repeatedly stalled by these conditions , and engines have had to be nursed along so carefully that only a feeble attack on the ice could be made . In the new craft , hot water is pumped into the " hotbox. " which is practically a dent in the hull  --  four by five and a quarter by seven feet in size . This melts the bits of ice which threaten to coat the strainer and raises the temperature of the water , so that the engine is never unduly chilled . Although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis of theory , with no chance of advance testing or checking , it gave a 100 per cent performance when it actually tackled the work of opening ports for convoys . Icebreaker specialists , who had been skeptical about the whole thing , discarded their opposition to the forward-propeller device on seeing the new craft in actual operation . Two of the new ships hav , a been successfully engaged in opening up icebound harbors for convoys , and several others are in process of building . One of their uses will be that of opening up Lake Superior for iron-ore shipments during the worst of the winter . Editor 's Note  --  This is the first of three articles by Mr. Johnston .
