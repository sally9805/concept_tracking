txt The financial community of the country  --  investment bankers , securities dealers and stock exchanges  --  will attempt to work out a united program for amending the federal securities laws . This was the decision reached yesterday at the first conference on securities legislation among representatives of the Securities and Exchange Commission , the Investment Bankers Association , the National Association of Securities Dealers , and the New York Curb Exchange . The representatives of investment bankers , over-the-counter *taus and stock exchange firms who were present agreed that the first step toward drawing up recommendations for submission to the 1941 session of Congress is to attempt to agree on a program . Yesterday 's meeting , therefore , decided that the representatives of the various sectors of the securities business who were present should attempt first to formulate their own programs and then to codify these programs into one agenda for discussion with the SEC . WIII List All Proposals This does not mean that only those recommendations will be pushed which have the unanimous approval of investment bankers , dealers , and stock exchanges . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposals , but also will show which suggestions for amending the securities laws have the united backing of all financial interests and which have the support of only one or two groups . Discussions with the SEC then will be taken ' up on the basis of this agenda . The next meeting with the SEC will be held sometime in the middle of August to review the progress which has been made . Actually , the agenda now to be drawn up probably will be the recommendations eventually submitted to Congress , although all items on the agenda may not receive SEC blessing . The SEC has indicated that any party participating in the conferences on securities law amendments will be free to present its program to Corigress next year regardless of whether the SEC concurs . Since the agenda will represent a composite of the suggestions , it probably will go to Congress in its entirety , even though some parts of it have the support of only one or two parties . Question of SEC Approval Chief question still to be determined is how much of the agenda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the backing of the financial community . Preparation of the agenda should not require much time since two parties to yesterday 's meeting , the Investment Bankers Association and the New York Curb Exchange , already have drawn up a fairly complete list of the amendments which they want made to the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 . Their next step will be to determine to what extent their , programs have the support of their own financial groups and of the other groups now associated in the study of the securities laws . Persons attending the conference yesterday were : Arthur Dean and R. Stewart of the Investment Bankers Association ; Wallace Fulton , Murray Hanson , Stewart S , Hawes and E. C. Brelsford of the NASD ; Col. William Lockwood of the New York Curb Exchange ; Baldwin Bane , director of the SEC registration division ; Gallatin Purcell , director of the SEC trading and exchange division ; and Chester Lane , SEC general counsel .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
