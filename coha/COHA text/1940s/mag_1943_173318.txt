During Buenos Aires ' annual carnival last week , police arrested twelve men for violating carnival rules by wearing masks . One of the twelve turned out to be the man whom the eleven others were impersonating : ebullient , ambitious , undersized Dr. Genaro Giacobini had induced them to go around , as he himself was doing , and chalk up " Giacobini For President " on Buenos Aires walls and houses . He was released . <P> Dr. Giacobini heads the Partido Salud Publica , 34 members strong . In black undertaker suit , wing collar and black tie , black gloves and derby , he appears at football games , swimming pools , public markets and parks , unstraps his portable platform and harangues for votes in Argentina 's forthcoming Presidential elections . Onetime member of the Buenos Aires Municipal Council , he introduced some 4,000 projects , never missed talking at least one hour at every session . <P> His program calls for , among other things , the immediate end of the war , improvement of the municipal zoo , cleansing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights and benches in his neighborhood park . He also proposes to solve both the financial situation and the fuel shortage , by burning the country 's garbage to make electricity . <P> Last month Dr. Giacobini wrote to the Pope , asking him " in my capacity as founder and president of the Partido Salud Publica " to end the war . He has not received an answer , but he is convinced that Archbishop Spellman 's visit to the Vatican ( TIME , Feb. 22 ) was closely related to his letter . Elated by this success , Dr. Giacobini decided last week to address similar epistles to President Roosevelt , Winston Churchill , Joseph Stalin , Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini , offering himself as Mediator for World War II .
