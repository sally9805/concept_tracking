1 from the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus telegraphed for reservations , how many beds would you set aside for them ? Suppose the circus giant arrived in company with his wife , how would you make them comfortable for the night ? And what would you do if the fat lady took a room and fell through her bed with a thump that rudely wakened most of the other tenants in the house . Answer those questions accurately , without rais  --  ing an eyebrow or losing a moment 's time , and you are eligible to stand in line for one of the trickiest jobs in the long history of innkeeping . They are thepreliminary qualifiers for manager of the Belvedere Hotel in New York City . The guest who thinks he 's seeing things is almost always right at the Belvedere . " A woman with two heads and two bodies just walked out of the elevator on one pair of legs , " a distraught newcomer reported to the room clerk one spring morning . The clerk looked bored . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was two women . " n And it was . Frieda , the armless and legless girl , was traveling from her room to the side show of the circus which was then doing business in Madison Square Garden across the street , propped on her mother 's hip . Down in the hotel basement , a service telephone rang . The Belvedere engineer picked up the receiver . Into it a woman 's voice was screaming , " Alli  --  gators ! " " Alligators ? " The engineer gulped . " Where ? " " Here in my room ! " the voice sobbed . " They chased me out of the bathtub ! " The engineer had serious doubts as he pushed the button for the service lift . But when he reached the designated room on the tenth floor , he found the bathtub crawling with dozens of four-legged little green reptiles . And more of the same were climbing up out of the drainpipe . The rest of that afternoon was spent putting stoppers into bathtubs . From room to room , the staff chased the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dusk , weary but un  --  daunted , they were wobbling weakly up from the drains in the cellar floor . Only one bathtub in the house still had its stopper out . It was in the room where Joe Trosey and Mike Healy lived . They came home from the circus matinee with dismay in their eyes . The livestock they had bought for their chameleon concession  --  some 300 lizards  --  had disappeared from that tub in the midst of an afternoon swim . Outwardly , the Belvedere is one of the least exciting-looking spots on Manhattan Island . An unimposing sixteen-story structure with sad stone eagles clinging to its sides , it stands between a greasy garage and a tawdry row of brownstone tene  --  ments on the edge of Hell 's Kitchen , west of Eighth Avenue on 49th Street . But its proximity to the Garden , where the circus shakes down its acts each year before taking them on the road , makes its guest list read like a small boy 's dream . The magician , some of the clowns and the man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the animal doctor and the fellow who has charge of the peanuts and the popcorn . The midgets chatter like flocking birds , and room by families . They sleep crosswise on single beds , three and four in a row . The giant and his wife sleep crosswise , too , on a pair of double beds anchored side by side , with a brace of chairs heaped with mammoth pillows to hold what is left of their eight-foot frames . All the performers are old friends now to Rodney H. Curly , the quiet , conservative man recently promoted to the managership of the Belvedere . Curly was accountant for the former manager , Harold H. Cummings , a big Dickensian character , and in this job he got a good preparation for run  --  ning a hotel unlike anything in his experience . Curly likes his job ; he is happy with the performers and they are happy with him  --  except for the fat lady , who never came back after she fell through the bed three times one night and had to be shored up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel business . Every  --  where else it stops on tour , the circus eats and sleeps on its own special railroad trains . The Belve  --  dere rooms are booked under a loose arrangement between the hotel and the Garden , whose president 's daughter owns a block of Belvedere stock . Thirty to thirty-five rooms are reserved for sixty to seventy-five circus performers , who , the management says , are the quietest guests in the house . " They drink only beer , " Harold Cummings told me , shortly before he left the Belvedere to become manager of another hotel , " and little of it . Their food is average American . They stick to their rooms and behave themselves . In fact , the only trouble we have with the circus is what you might call psy  --  chological . " Walking into the bar as he made this remark , he waved a beefy hand to illustrate his point . " Suppose you are sitting here having a drink . You look in the mirror . An elephant looks back . Does it encourage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phants appear and disappear in that mirror every day the circus is in town . The regular trade sees them and knows the animals are in the street behind them , lining up for the next performance . But if a new customer does n't have presence of mind to turn his head , his next stop is Alcoholics Anony  --  mous . " There is a gentle madness about the Belvedere most of the time . Once a yearit rears up and takes complete possession of the establishment . This is in the fall , when the Rodeo whoops into the Gar  --  den . The broncobusters with the outfit take up as many as sixty-five rooms  --  that 's 125 cowpunchers , podner  --  and bog down the kitchen with orders for steaks and chops . They pitch silver dollars  --  in lieu of horseshoes  --  in the hotel lobby , and generally manage to make the place look like a Wild West saloon on a modernistic frontier , with gaudy red photo-muraled walls behind swinging doors of chromium and glass . Two days before the first cow hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and red leather chairs are moved into basement storage . Mirrors are taken from the walls . Potted palms and whatever else conceivably could be picked up and thrown are put out of sight . ( Continued on Page 42 ) MANHATTAN 'S HOUSE OF BEDLAM ( Continued fr Page 39 ) The reason for these precautions is apparent from the following eyewitness description of a barroom scene : The bar was filled with cowboys , all of them talking at the top of their voices . At the far end , one had been bulldogged and trussed up , and was struggling hard to get out of his bonds . Two companions who apparently had done the trussing were leaning against the wall , watching . " I do n't think we got his hat fur enough down over his eyes , " one of them said . " But he shore looks purty . " Loud howls from the lobby interrupted . A couple of old pals were greeting each other . One of them yelled , " Why , Hank , you old so-and-so ! " and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you all over , you old skunk ! " After a brief tussle , they fell to the floor and wrestled . As they grappled , they would dig their spurs into the floor and shove themselves along an inch or so , always toward t he bar . Drinking usually starts around nine A.M. and continues steadily until the bar shuts down between two and four next morning . Bourbon and cola is the standard mixture . A cowboy who wants to celebrate by buying for the crowd does n't just tell the barkeep so and then pick up the tab . He climbs onto the bar and dances round its oval top , clicking his high heels and knocking glasses right and left with his spurs . Since cowboys instinctively gang up on strangers who meddle in their af  --  fairs , no one but a cowboy can keep peace among them . For the past six years the Belvedere has brought an ox-shouldered six-footer , Howard Mc  --  Crory , all the way from Deadwood , South Dakota , to do the job . The wage it pays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six fried eggs and a nine-inch stack of flapjacks , with dinner and supper to match . This year they also hired huge Dub Phillips of St. Angelo , Texas , anticipating increased rough  --  house . But high prices have toned the waddies down . They drank beer in  --  stead of bourbon , and were much better behaved . Only two murders have been com  --  mitted on the premises during Mc Crory 's time , which is considered good behavior . Both victims were " civil  --  ians " ? the Belvedere term for anyone who does n't wear boots , spurs and a broad-brimmed hat during the Rodeo season . Another " civilian " was the original owner of a paper bag full of broken teeth which were removed from safe keeping behind the bar just a few months back . Barkeep Tommy Quinn had gathered the molars from the floor and saved them for a year because the man who wore them in was unconscious at the time he went out . " He could n't have made much use of them , " Tommy said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're running a clip joint . " Comparative quiet descends after the Rodeo gallops off . But it is only comparative . The Garden has at least one new act a month , and each act pro  --  duces its own variety of migraine at the Belvedere . One week a prize Persian , entered in the cat show , hides in a bedspring and refuses to come out until the judging is over . Next week the lobby is overrun with boys swinging hockey sticks they want autographed by the Garden stars . Sonja Henie 's masseuse threatens to leave at the height of the ice show be  --  cause the hotel does n't serve stalk  --  gasbord . Basketball stars from all over the country are kept under lock and key to forestall bribes in the inter  --  collegiate championships . A great Dane , scheduled for the dog show , pokes its head across the registration desk to sniff the flower in the clerk 's lapel while the girl on the other end of the leash pleads , " Can I keep him in my room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forth across 49th Street the strange procession travels from October to May . Then the Belvedere is left to what is known as the " dull " season . Even in the summer the Bel  --  vedere is not without glamour . Vic Raschi , Frank Shea and Yogi Berra stay there when the Yanks are in town . It is during this " dull " season that one millionaire roomer blows soap bub  --  bles from his window to amuse the ( Con f e : : : aerie on Page 45 ) ( Continued from Page 42 ) neighbors on Sunday afternoons . Maaron Glemby , a painter and model , puts herself to sleep at night by count  --  ing the drops that fall from a coffee cup on an animated advertising sign across the Hudson River in New Jersey . If The Star-Spangled Banner needs to be sung for any reason , there is Miss Gladys Goodding , of Missouri , who makes a career of singing it to crowds at the Garden and the Brooklyn Dodgers ' ball park . A daughter of Alice Foote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six-foot beauties from the Diamond Horseshoe play tag in their nighties in the upper corridors . The tipoff to this " quieter " side of the Belvedere 's character is Assistant Manager Ken Brereton , a former re  --  porter for Billboard . His presence as custodian of the reservations con  --  notes acknowledgment that the hotel is just an old-fashioned greasepaint boardinghouse at heart . More than half the 434 rooms are occupied by regular tenants , and most of those be  --  long to the stage . Fate fixed the ratio of Belvedere ten  --  ancy when it decreed that there is nothing like a cup of coffee and a ba  --  loney sandwich to spark Broadway genius . For that combination , or an acceptable substitute , can be thrown together at any hour in the serving pantries that go with the hotel 's spa  --  cious rooms . Antiquated wooden ice  --  boxes refrigerate these homey snacks , and the hotel 's own iceman makes the rounds each day with the final dripping touch of informality . The roomer who runs short of dishes or table silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tray in the hall , then sneaks out and grabs as much as he can handle . When the hotel kitchen supply gets down to the point where there is n't enough left to go round the dining room , the chef raids the house from top to bottom and the process starts all over again . Contrary to usual custom in the big city , everybody who lives on a floor knows everybody else who lives there . On hot summer nights , across-the-hall neighbors obligingly prop their doors open to create a breeze . And one of the Belvedere 's staff raises chickens on his Long Island farm for those who like something special for Sunday dinner . A wrinkled little English tailor ob  --  serves this communal bliss from a three-legged stool on the second floor and dreams of the profits it might have brought him , if only he had kept his option on the brownstone house at 319 West 48th Street back in the Golden ' 20 's . But he let it lapse and lost his savings in another property . He dreams of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front lobby . He is Isaac Scofield , the Belve  --  dere valet . Isaac was not alone in his bad guess . No one else made money from the Belvedere until the Wolf brothers , Morton and Charles , took it over on a lucky hunch a week before the Japs attacked Pearl Harbor . Two banks had foreclosed mortgages since the place was built in 1926 . A large and thriving livery stable stood directly across from the front door when the Belvedere first opened . Every roomer had his own fly swatter , and a few were also equipped with sawed-off shotguns . For the gangsters of the dry era saw considerable advan  --  tage in having such comfortable quarters so close to the Hudson piers . The big Boston bootlegger , Charles ( King ) Solomon , was living on the fourteenth floor behind two sets of bodyguards and a bulletproof vest when what was left of his girl friend , Esther Gordon , was found in a barrel at Hell Gate . One of the Dutch Schultz mob was shot on his way from the subway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jersey . And it was at the Belvedere that Dapper Dan Collins was last picked up by the cops . The whodunit atmosphere was a perfect blind for the FBI . The G-men came to work on the Lindbergh case and stayed to wait for Pretty Boy Floyd , the killer , who followed the Rodeo like a thrill-crazed boy . In their spare time they drove golf balls out ( Continued on Page nil ( Gust 11 from Pee , /6 ) their windows onto the roof of the Garden to heckle mass meetings of the communists . The law-abiding guests in that lusty era were inclined to be temperamental . An author who lived on the eleventh floor tossed his typewriter out the window because a key stuck . " After all , " he said , " it was a portable . " Un  --  wary guests often stumbled over Frankie Conville , the vaudeville comic , while he lay on the lobby floor with his arms and legs aloft , playing dead dog . The Belvedere 's dapper house physi  --  cian , Dr. Sidney Scheinrnan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few of his own . There was , for instance , the young woman who walked into his office in a thin house wrap and asked for treatment for low blood pres  --  sure . He explained that the best anti  --  dote for that condition was plentiful exercise . " Doctor , " the patient asked crossly , " do you know who I am ? " She was Sally Rand . Al Ritz , the eldest of the buffooning brothers , liked to hang around Doctor Scheinman 's waiting room . One day an emergency case was brought in for a simple but instant operation . Al vol  --  unteered to help , and the doctor asked him to administer the anesthetic . The patient was to count slowly up to ten , so they could tell , by his trailing voice , how fast , he was losing consciousness . Everything was ready . The doctor gave the signal . The patient started to count . And Al , bending conscientiously over the anesthetic cone , put himself to sleep . The grand old man of the Belvedere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous for his Tiger Rag lyrics when he moved in twenty years ago , he is still there , still writing songs . His memories of the place sound like an op-eretta written around the Hollywood telephone book . Bing Crosby was an unknown voice singing Mississippi Mud for Paul Whiteman when his trunk was sold to pay his room rent . Red Skelton , hav  --  ing worn out an act on how to dunk a doughnut , kept himself alive by win  --  ning five-dollar prizes at marathon dances . Charlie McCarthy was just going into the movies on the Warner Brothers lot in Brooklyn when Edgar Bergen signed an IOU that De Costa still keeps as a souvenir . Fritzi Scheff , the redheaded queen of musical comedy , addressed her Peking  --  ese pups as " children " and sang Kiss Me Again on the slightest provocation . With miles of bright lights in the years behind her , she could afford to be gen  --  erous with nonentities like Charlie But  --  terworth , Frank Fay , Cary Grant , Ella Logan , Martha Raye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms around her . The hotel itself was a soft touch for almost anyone who found heaven at the Palace Theater . So many song-and  --  dance acts were concocted beneath its roof that Actor Joey Faye is writing a book about them . Tunes like Stormy Weather were first banged out there between midnight and dawn . Unpaid bills soared to thousands of dollars , and one new manager followed another for a decade and a half , until the lobby was finally cut through to 49th Street to at  --  tract the Garden crowds and stave off bankruptcy . West of Eighth Avenue is still the wrong side of the tracks in New York City . But the war-born housing short  --  age packs the Belvedere as tightly as any place else . A platinum blonde named Oklahoma Sue , unable to get a room , does the next best thing : she re  --  ceives her mail each night at the Belvedere bar . THE EN n
