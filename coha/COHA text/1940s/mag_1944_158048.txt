U.S. Army press officers in London had insisted that Lieut . General Lesley J. Mc-Nair , trainer of the Army 's ground fight ing forces , had been killed by the enemy . But too many-people knew better , and last week the tragic truth came out . Able , respected " Whitey " McNair had been killed by a bomb dropped from a U.S. plane . <P> Like many a plain front-line G.I. , General McNair was hit by a wild salvo dropped in the heavy air preparations for the Normandy breakthrough ( see WORLD BATTLEFRONTS ) . <P> Death from the errors of fellow soldiers is an old story in war-especially in combat involving aircraft . But few officers of such high rank have died that way . Most memorable accident in U.S. military history : the death of General Thomas ( " Stonewall " ) Jackson , who was shot by his North Carolinians as he galloped at dusk through a grove of trees at Chancellorsville . <P> When his aides asked the mortally wounded Jackson if he was badly hurt , he answered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I am-and all my wounds are from my own men . " Supreme Headquarters ' report included no dying words from Whitey McNair , a thoroughgoing professional soldier who must also have died without bitterness . <P> Whitey McNair left an only son to carry on . This week the War Department announced that redheaded , 37-year-old Colonel Douglas McNair , a West Pointer and an artilleryman like his father , had been killed in action on Guam .
