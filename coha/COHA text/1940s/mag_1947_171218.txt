U.S. doctors have lately been hearing about a new drug so powerful that it may eventually replace morphine as the standard painkiller .

Last week the American Medical Association Journal published an encouraging verdict by a team of U.S. Public Health Service investigators . Among other things , amidone has proved helpful in treating morphine addicts . <P> Amidone itself is definitely habit-forming . Because a single factory could produce more amidone than the total world supply of morphine , the doctors warned that the drug must be rigidly controlled ; it might become a major health menace . <P> But for medical uses , amidone has great advantages . Unlike morphine , it does not make addicts violently sick or produce an attack of the shakes when suddenly cut off .
