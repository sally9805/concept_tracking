PM , which began life as a newspaperman 's dream , would this week be just a newspaperman 's memory . The idealistic Manhattan tabloid , which its founders meant to be the voice and the solace of pushed-around people , had never made the grade either as a business proposition or as a newspaper . One day this week , seven weeks after Attorney Bartley Crum and Newsman Joseph Barnes took it over from disheartened Marshall Field ( TIME , May 10 ) , PM became the New York Star . <P> It was indicative of the new team 's thinking that the Star 's first gleam was timed to coincide with the news-heavy Republican convention-a consideration that would never have moved the old , pink-eyed PM . The paper now has only a puny 90,000 circulation in New York City . About 2,900 of its 125,000 copies go to Philadelphia , and Crum &; Barnes want to get 50,000 readers away from Philadelphia 's Inquirer and Bulletin . <P> The old PM began as an afternoon paper but actually came out late in the morning with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a morning newspaper . Although the city badly needs a good afternoon paper , the Star chooses to buck the tougher competition of the monolithic Daily News and Hearst 's Mirror . <P> Final Decree . The Star 's first edition would show a new face and format , new talent and backers . Page One , unlike other New York tabs , would change from a poster to a news page . Inside , by Joe Barnes 's decree , news and comment would be finally divorced . On the editorial page , run by George Wells , lately of Newsweek , the signed editorials were out ; from now on the paper would speak for itself . <P> PM Editorialists Max Lerner and I. F. Stone ( now in Palestine ) will become thrice-a-week columnists , and have been told to keep it brief . As cartoonists , the Star has hitched a talented team : young Bill Mauldin and , for the editorial page , Veteran Edmund Duffy , three-time Pulitzer Prizewinner , who recently left the Baltimore Sun . <P> Ask the Experts . To help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able Strippers Al ( Li'l Abner ) Capp and Milton ( Steve Canyon ) Caniff as consultants , figuring that if he ca n't publish their strips he can at least pick their brains . Others in the new braintrust : Editor Richard Lauterbach of ' 48 , part-time adviser on layout and features ; Lawrence Resner , who left a labor reporting job on the New York Times to be Crum 's right-hand man ; Managing Editor Jay Odell , a Nieman Fellow and former telegraph editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer . PM Editor John P. Lewis , who had kept the staff together during eight uncertain weeks , was out on the street . <P> Publisher Crum was still coy about his backers . Marshall Field , he explained , will keep only a 25% interest in the Star . Together , Crum &; Barnes will hold 33 ? % . In the next fortnight they will select , from offers of $3,000,000 in working capital , the $1,500,000 they want .                  @ @ @
