Asia 's babbling voices joined last week in a notable and noisy effort at unison . On their main theme , reaction against Western domination , Asians ( they no longer wanted to be known as Asiatics ) achieved fairly close harmony . <P> Ancient Delhi , a seat of Asiatic culture a dozen centuries before Christianity , had never seen anything quite like the Inter-Asian Relations Conference . For the first time in history , Asians representing half the world 's people came together under Asiatic sponsorship . The 200 delegates , from 30-odd countries and colonial territories , made an impressive spectacle . There were tiny , sloe-eyed Indonesian women in batiked lungis and husky Nepalese soldiers in rich blue brocade , bejeweled princesses , fez-topped Arabs , and lamas from Tibet in long crimson kimonos , their hair done in braids and their ears weighted with blue stone ornaments . <P> India 's Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru , who promoted the show and missed no cue to promote India as the natural leader of the East , pitched the tone . Said he : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by others . " <P> Another Renaissance . A Burman justice named Chow Mien , leading a delegation notable for magenta skirts and orange Aunt Jemima turbans , took up Nehru 's song of independence from the white man 's rule . So did Mustapha Momen of the Arab League , whose delegates represented distant Syria , Iraq , Yemen , Saudi Arabia . Said he : " Liberty has dawned and the world is destined to witness another renaissance in Asia . " The first voice which had raised a war cry of " Asia for the Asiatics " was missing . Japan was not represented because , said Nehru , " Japanese are not allowed to leave their country at present for such purposes . " <P> The conference strained over discords . India 's Moslem League boycotted it , but the delegates from other heavily Moslem nations ignored the League 's protests over their presence. * Vietnamese delegates called Cambodians " French puppets " and drew a retort from Her Highness You Pan Tror , a stocky , swarthy Princess , that Cambodia would have nothing to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her interpreter ( the conference 's many voices were translated into Asia 's lingua franca-English ) . <P> The Chinese delegates , headed by George Yeh , a Kuomintang yesman in the Foreign Office , took one look at the neon-lighted map behind the rostrum and rose in objection . The map showed Tibet as independent and , they gravely protested , was it not internationally recognized that Tibet is a part of China ? The map was hastily changed ; the poker-faced expressions of the Tibetans , who had journeyed 21 days by foot , pony , train and plane from their mountain-rimmed domain , changed to amused indulgence . When Madame Karim el Sayid , a young and buxom Egyptian , opposed Jewish immigration to Palestine , the five delegates from Palestine 's Hebrew University walked out . <P> Another Imperialism ? Into the discussions came a theme that a new white imperialism , " different and more subtle , " was rising in Asia . After several such references , up rose handsome , jut-jawed Sirdar Kumar Jagjit Singh , an observer for the India League of America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new imperialism " referred to the U.S. , and " would the delegates please be less vague and name the country meant ? " None did .
