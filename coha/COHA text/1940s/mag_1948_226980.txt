John Christopher Kehoe likes to rear back in his wheel chair and bellow : " Want to see my horns ? I 've got them . I fight chickens , you know . I 'm proud of it-keeps me alive . " Last week , he was wheeled into a pagoda-shaped , whitewashed building outside Orlando , Fla. and sat , grim and lordly ( in a pit-side box built specially for him and his wheel chair ) . John Kehoe 's hand trembled as one of his game cocks , a fierce looking grey muff , was brought into the pit , weighed and made ready for battle . <P> It was Orlando 's 29th annual cockfighting tournament-though no word of it appeared in Florida newspapers last week . Florida is the only state in the union where cockfighting is legal ( but the heavy betting that goes on at the pit is not , hence the secrecy ) . <P> The referee addressed the crowd : " Gentlemen , please clear the pit . " The men began to drift off the dirt-floored circle ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred " or " A hundred to eighty . " The usual bet was $100 . The big ones-$1,000 and up-were made more quietly , by a whisper , a nod , a flick of a finger . On the wall was a sign saying " No Profanity Allowed . " There was none . In the audience , one woman fed a baby from a bottle . <P> There were about 400 in the crowd . It included a Texas oil millionaire , a Philadelphia income-tax lawyer , and a professional gambler from Memphis . Fourteen cockfighters had each posted $1,000 to enter . <P> Staccato Flaps . When his handler released him , John Kehoe 's grey tore across the pit , neck-feathers up . His onrushing enemy was a powerful red rooster equipped , like the grey , with needle-sharp , steel gaffs that man had added to his natural weapons . ( U.S. cockfighters consider themselves more humane than Latin Americans , who use razor-edge " slashers . " ) The cocks hit each other almost two feet off the ground , in a staccato flap of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sponged blood from their heads . Above the excited hubbub rose a woman 's flat drawl : " Come on , red rooster , kill him . " But it was the red rooster that got killed . <P> After the first two days , the halfway mark , Kehoe 's greys had won seven fights without losing one . Their owner chortled gleefully from his wheel chair : " The way they 're dropping you 'd think I was using a shotgun on them . " A man from Tennessee , allowing that Kehoe was right , said to a man from North Carolina : " There 's something that old man 's got onto . " <P> Coal &; Chicks . If there was , tough old John C. Kehoe was n't saying . Son of a coal miner , he picked slate in Pennsylvania 's hard-coal country for 45 a day . As a boy , instead of shooting marbles , he was fighting game chicks-against other kids in Pittston , Pa . He became the hard-fisted political boss of Luzerne County and owner of half a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The big difference between Kehoe and the 150,000 other people who fight roosters in the U.S. is that he crows about it .
