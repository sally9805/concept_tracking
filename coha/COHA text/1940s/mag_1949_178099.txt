In the scrabbly hill country of central Pennsylvania , where coal runs rich to the surface , a man could almost breathe the trouble in the air . Across five counties the peace was broken by Americans fighting Americans . <P> At the black-scarred coal strips and tipples of 70 independent coal mines , owners and a scattering of non-union diggers worked warily , with loaded shotguns and rifles close at hand . A convoy of 15 loaded coal trucks was ambushed in hilly Centre County , attacked with rifle fire and stones before the drivers could rumble on to safety . At Grassflat , a $10,000 tipple of the Junedale Coal Co. was blown up by a 50-lb. charge of dynamite . One non-union mine owner drove off marauding strikers with a brace of .45 automatics ; another was stabbed during an argument with U.M.W. pickets in front of the Hawthorn , Pa. post office . <P> Guns &; Dynamite . The trouble reached to other rebellious patches of John L. Lewis ' empire as picketing union miners tried to repair small defects in the weapon that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hawkes Coal Co. tipple near Morgantown , Ky. was dynamited . In a lonely stretch of northwest Alabama , six brothers named Preskitt stocked their 150-ton-a-day strip mine with all the weapons they could find and waited grimly for something to happen . <P> <P> It did next day . Scores of men came running and crawling through the woods , shot it out with the Preskitts for two hours . One intruder was carried away with a shattered jaw , his chest and abdomen peppered with buckshot . The Preskitts finally gave in , agreed to close down their mine until " an agreement " could be reached . But other independents kept operating . " We 're going to stay in operation unless we 're shot out , " roared one owner . <P> Layoffs &; Grocery Bills . John L. Lewis himself was devoting only part of his time to the state of his mine workers . He absented himself from negotiations with the operators at White Sulphur Springs and Bluefield , W.Va. , and traveled to Springfield , Ill. to visit his 91-year-old mother who was seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the nation-and on his 480,000 coal miners-was clearly not accomplishing its purpose . <P> By week 's end , some 50,000 non-U.M.W. miners were digging 400,000 tons of coal a day , about 18% of the nation 's normal output . Coal stocks above ground were enough to keep the country running normally for about two months ; with steel shut down , the supply would last far longer than that . The miners themselves , with winter to face and grocery bills to pay , were restless . <P> Northern , southern and western coal operators sat calmly at negotiating tables in West Virginia , apparently willing to wait indefinitely for Lewis to name his terms for a new contract . Lewis had cut output with his " memorial " and " stabilizing " stoppages and the three-day work week ; yet he had let his miners dig enough coal to keep them in business . <P> This time , even John L. seemed to realize that he had gone too far . Leaving the announcement to a lieutenant , he ordered 80,000 Pennsylvania anthracite diggers and his 22,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this week . So far , the only victims of John ' Lewis ' haughty methods were his own miners .
