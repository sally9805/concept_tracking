Nothing happened in Japan to make news last week , and this in itself was news . <P> So suspicious was the silence of a naturally talkative officialdom that New York Times Correspondent Otto D. Tolischus went burrowing for the reason . He discovered that behind the scenes Japanese statesmen , politicians , businessmen and Army &; Navy bigwigs were heatedly debating the issue of war or peace with the U.S. <P> Legalistically , the issue is this : if the U.S. convoys war materials to Britain , is this an " attack " on Germany , the nation whom Japan has agreed to defend in case of attack ? Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka , reported Correspondent Tolischus , thinks so . <P> Behind him are all those groups which believe in totalitarianism and Nazi invincibility , especially the younger men in the Army and in the bureaucracy . Older , more conservative groups in both the Government and the Army are suspicious of the aims of both Germany and Russia , and behind them are most of the people . They do not want to involve Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regardless of legalistics . <P> How Germany felt about the treaty was brought home to the Japanese people by none other than Germany 's Grand Admiral Erich Raeder . Timing an exclusive interview with Domei 's Berlin Correspondent Susumu Ejiri so that it was published the day before President Franklin Roosevelt 's fireside talk this week , the Admiral issued a warning to the U.S. that was , by inference , also a warning to Japan . <P> Said he : <P> " I can only confirm President Roosevelt 's opinion that convoying means shooting , and since according to American statements cargoes of convoyed ships must be regarded as contraband , the introduction of such a convoy system would be not only an unneutral act under international law , but a plain act of war and unprovoked aggression . " In other words , if the U.S. convoys , Germany will shoot-and expect the Japanese to shoot too .
