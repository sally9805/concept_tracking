The geographic shape of the U.S. was drastically altered last week just as effectively as it could have been done by a convulsion of nature . It was done by a 9-to-2 decision of the Interstate Commerce Commission . The South and West were brought nearer to the center of the nation and the Northeast was moved farther away . The ICC thus rearranged the U.S. by its decision to equalize freight rates , on a mileage basis , between all sections of the country except mouritain-Pacific territory . <P> The abolition of the higher rates to the South and West was a clear-cut victory for Georgia 's energetic Governor Ellis Gibbs Arnall , who last June carried the South 's case to the Supreme Court ( TIME , April 9 ) . It was also a victory for Attorney General Francis Biddle , who last September filed suit against a roster of the railroads operating west of the Mississippi . <P> The ICC , with its usual thoroughness , presented the railroads with a massive document that traced the history of the rate battle back to 1887 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are situated - in the South , West , or East - at the same distance from a given point , they would each pay the same rate . This cracked at one blow the freight rate structure , which has influenced the economic distribution of industries , and set up a new structure which may make some of the existing distribution uneconomic . <P> Having dropped this blockbuster , the ICC gave carriers 90 days to appeal and submit proposals for the new rates . The weary Commissioners were prepared for a barrage of protests from northern railroads , chambers of commerce , trade associations and shippers . <P> But to let the country and the courts know that it meant business , ICC ordered an interim adjustment in rates . Well aware that the rate hearings could drag on indefinitely , the ICC ruled that , effective Aug. 30 , rates in the South and West will be reduced 10% , while rates in the Northeast will be increased 10% . <P> This last device showed a serious weakness in the change . There is no sound economic reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the railroads serving that area are doing very nicely at present . <P> The reason for this rate-raising is that the railroads of the South and West , having much less traffic , presumably could not bear equalization if it were achieved entirely by cutting their rates . Thus equal economic opportunity for the South and West is to be secured , not by their taking two steps forward , but by their taking one step forward and the East taking one step back .
