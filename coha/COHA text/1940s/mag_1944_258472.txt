WHAT BECAME OF ANNA BOLTON ? - Louis Bromfield-Harper ( $2.50 ) . <P> THE FINAL HOUR-Taylor Caldwell-Scribner ( $3 ) . <P> Author Bromfield and Authoress Caldwell ( British-born Mrs. Marcus Reback of Buffalo ) are alike in two respects : both have many readers ; both have very theatrical ideas of the world . Their latest novels reveal a further likeness . Both authors appear to have thought that a lush subject for fiction would be the regeneration of fabulously rich Americans by war shock . <P> Bromfield unveils Anna Bolton , daughter of an Ohio scrubwoman , as a glittering creature of wealth in Neville Chamberlain 's London . He takes her from this lavishly mad prewar society , spots her at the Ritz in Paris while France is falling , has her strafed in her Rolls-Royce in a roadful of refugees , finally sets her down in Unoccupied France to run a village canteen , care for a motherless baby , marry a member of the underground . By this process she " grows a soul . " Caldwell reintroduces a family she has written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blackest-hearted munitions makers ever spawned by the folklore of America 's peace-befuddled ' 30s . They quarrel , haggle , hate , interbreed with disdain , intrigue desperately against one another and their country . At the end of 561 perfervid pages , the toughest member of the current generation forces his malignant tribe to acknowledge that they had better cooperate with the war effort or else . <P> Readers who have time for only one of these books must choose either 1 ) to be bored by an author who elaborates a fancy plot without turning it into a moving story , or 2 ) to be stirred up by an authoress who turns a passion inside out on every page . It is a choice between cold tripe and hot tripe .
