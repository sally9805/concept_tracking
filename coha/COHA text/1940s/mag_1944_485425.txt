IT is an unmistakable fact that the demand of the country at the present time is for speedy action on the tariff bill , and that a conclusion of some sort is really of more importance than the nature of the bill itself . The reason for this is very easy to see With a duty of 1,000 per cent or with absolute free trade , the manufacturer , the importer , the jobber , the country merchant , the moneylender , and the housekeeper , all know what to expect Foresight is. the first element and factor of commerce Foresight is impossible in the present state of uncertainty respecting the new tariff , which is to go into effect on the 1st of June  --  perhaps Carpet-making , for instance , one of the country 's greatest industries , ' depends on foreign wool as its chief raw material . The duty on these wools is 32 per cent There never was any reason for any duty at all on these wools , as they are not produced in this country A duty was - enacted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tariff " combine . " The wool-growers were afraid that some carpet wool would be used in the manufacture of clothing if there were no duty So it was enacted that 32 cents tax should be paid on every dollar 's worth of carpet wool , and - then goat 's hair , and camel 's hair , and other materials never produced here were taxed lest they should be used as substitutes for wool In respect of carpet wools the McKinley tariff became a perfect hornet 's nest of difficulties to the honest manufacturer . No legislation of the middle ages could be worse . Nevertheless , the manufacturers know now what it costs to get wool They have measured all the difficulties and have fixed the prices of carpets accordingly . But what can a manufacturer do now , with the prospect of free wool after the first of June 2 He can not " stock up " with wool at 32 per cent . duty . He can not load the market with carpets made at high costwhen he has reason to think that low-cost carpets will make their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticising the former administration , say the Hawaiian annexationists That is true if it is a - criticism to present in vei y clear light the fact that President HarriSon sent in the treaty of annexation on the 15th of February , 1893 , or about two weeks before the expiration of his term , evidently hoping that it would be ratified and become an accomplished fact before the new President and Senate could assume the offices to which they had been chosen . This was an attempt to forestall not only the , new President and Senate , but also the people of the United States . Time and again it had been proved that the people were opposed to the annexation of distant islands They had rejected- the island of St. Thomas against the most urgent efforts of Mr. Seward to compass its acquisition . They had rejected San Domingo against the repeated and persevering efforts of President Grant . They would even have refused Alaska but for the feeling that its rejection would be in the nature of an affront to the Czar of Russia , to whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional policy of the country , handed down from George Washington  --  and he left Ins nothing better , nothing which time has more fully approved  --  was opposed to such acquisitions It was a most unjustifiable act on the part of Mr Harrison to attempt a snap judgment on the people in the brief interval of two weeksbefore leaving office It was also discourteous to-his successor . The offence is aggravated by the fact , that in order to take the snap judgment , it became necessary to ignore the Queen 's very reasonable request for a hearing . To give such a hearing would have involved delay till the new President and Senate should come in . If such a transaction in the ordinary concerns of life should come for review before a court of law , it would be characterized in terms which we should not like to see applied to a President or an ex-President of the United States . Senator Hoar is often amusing in debate , but was never more amusing than when he said on the 13th inst that of the three hundred-odd cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the consent of the Senate , only twenty or thirty were exactly like the appointment of Blount Twenty or thirty will do . The fuss made over Blount 's appointment and about the use of the word " paramount " in defining his authority is as childish as most of the other talk in this affair . Mr. Blount 's report has put our Minister Stevens and the insurgents in the wrong , and has therefore set their friends in this country raging like angry fishwives . The insurgents now see their mistake They see that they ought to have risen against the Queen without Mr Stevens 's help or connivance , and have overthrown her in a stand-up fight , and proclaimed themselves an independent republic if they had succeeded . Their position then before the world would have been unimpeachable , and President Cleve- , land would have had no right to investi gate them ; and they could have based their government on - anything they plea , sed  --  men , - cattle , sugar , or bananas But they did not want to expose-themselves to the Queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States marines ; and when the Queen gave way to the United States , they hurried to Washington to get themselves into the Union , not foreseeing that this move would expose them to unpleasant - inquiries , and would throw the mgrs of the Constitution over the , brown men whom they are trying to disfranchise on account of race and color . They now say of themselves that they are " Americans , " and the only " respectable " people on the island , but this is what the Southerners said in the reconstruction period , and what they said when the Force bill was passing-in the House . How did Reed meet this , and Lodge , and Hoar , and Frye , and the Tribune , and the whole Republican phalanx 1 , We could , if we chose to give the space to it , dig out from their speeches some sad passages about the denial of- the suffrage to poor colored men by respectable and rich whites ; and yet the native Hawaiians are far more civilized than the negroes of the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which we have had diplomatic relations and made treaties . Ex-Minister Stevens has suddenly discovered that he foUnd authority for all that he did at Honolulu in instructions given by Secretary Bayard in 1887 . He cites from Mr. Bayard 's despatch to Minister Merrill the statement that " American citizens in Hawaii must be protected-in their persons and property by the representatives of their country 'S law and power , and no internal discord must be suffered to impair them . " Now , if Stevens considered this sufficient authorization for his conduct , why did he ask , from both Blaine and Foster , explicit instructions to aid the revolution ? Was it because he noted Bayard 's injunction , in the same despatch , to " abstain from interference with the domestic affairs of Hawaii " ? However that may be , it is a pure afterthought for Stevens to pretend that he landed the troops to protect the-persons and property of American citizens . He was asked by the committee of safety-to land troops because " we are unable to protect ourselves without aid , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Not a word in their appeal referred to , American citizens .

Vol. 57 , No. 1486 featly secure in the city , Stevens himself was not able to say , in his evasive replies , that there was any danger to American interests Indeed , there is over- whelming evidence that the city was quiet and business going on as usual , and that the landing of the troops was a great surprise to all not in the secret For example , Vice-Consul-General W. P. Boyd testified that there was " no suggestion of disorder , " and that it was the general impression that the troops had landed because they were " friendly to the movement of the committee of safety . " The reported agreement of the city banks to furnish S30,000,000 of gold for export , if so much should be required in order to prevent a drain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apt illustration , of the changed condition of affairs brought about by the repeal of the Sherman act Not only have the gold resources of the banks largely increased , but the mental attitude of the bankers on the subject of gold and gold hoarding is very much changed . Before the silver-purchase act was repealed , the yellow metal. was much more highly prized than it is now Everybody wanted all he could get . The apprehension of a time coming when gold would be at a premium caused a mental premium to exist all the time Now , however , the bankers as well as the public are perfectly content that the gold standard exists and is not to be shaken This point being settled , it is immaterial whether the banks have 580 , - 000,000 more or less of that metal , provided the supply in the Treasury remains sufficient If the country must part with $80,000,000 gold , it is better that it should come from the bank vaults , for the reason that people are accustomed to keep an eye on the Treasury stock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain Conclusions therefrom , while they are not in the habit of scrutinizing the bank returns , and , even if they were , they would not be likely to draw any unfavorable conclusions front a diminishing gold balance . In other words , the public imagination is worked upon by the gold in the Treasury , while it remains unaffected by that of- the banks Really there is no difference between the two sources for paying an international balance . As long as the Government is solvent the banks will remain so , and the distribution of gold between them is , of little consequence It is of much less consequence now than at any form.er time in our history whether the gold reserve of the banks is large or small As time advances , we learn more and more clearly the priceless advantage we hold by reason of our distance from powerful neighbors , which enables us to dispense not only with a large army and navy , but also with a large hoard of gold , of which an over-supply is useless and costly . We learn that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mve , expecting the tocsin of war to sound at any moment , gold is useful only for two purposes , viz : as a test of the soundness of its paper currency and as a means of settling international balances ? - It is not strange that the hill for - the admission of Utah as a State passed the House last week without a division , arid that the Republicans did not feel anxious to go on record upon it under a call for the yeas and nays Their party in 1890 admitted Idaho , Which had only 84,385 people by the census of that year , and Wyoming , which had but 60,705 , whereas ' Utah had three years ago a population of 207,905 , and is growing much more rapidly than either Wyoming or Idaho . Nevertheless , it is a mistake to admit- Utah or any other Territory now . Because we have several States which ought to be Territories is no reason for making another mistake of the same sort Congressman Harter of Ohio put the argument against the proposition very forcibly when he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can civilize Kansas , in other words , that so long as Western States of the age of Kansas are capable of the follies we have seen in the past thred years , we ought not to increase the risks of the nation by making new States of even less promising material . - One reason why the Republicans in the House made no more serious oPposibon to the bill for the admisSion of Utah is the hope , which many of them entertain , that theirparty , instead of the Democratic , may profit by the movement - Although the present , Democratic delegate from the Territory was elected by nearly 3,000 majority last year , the Republicans have been gaining ground of late years , and it is by no means impossible that they will be in control before a great while. - But it is the height of folly for either party to pin its faith to the future of a new State . The Democrats consented to the admission of Colorado in 1876 because they thought they were sure to carry it ; and then found that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seated even after South Carolina , Florida , and Louisiana had been counted for the Republican candidate . When Idaho was admitted in 1890 , with only 84,385 people , the Republicans regarded it as sine for their party , and yet only three years later the Republican candidate for President lost its three electoral votes The proposition to make Arizona a State is most indefensible . The population of the Territory in 1890 was but 59,620 ; and the gain in the ten previous years was only 19,180 The case of Wyoming was bad enough  --  a Territory which , we repeat , had only 60,705 people when it was made a State in 1890 ; but Wyoming had trebled its population during the previous decade , while Arizona gained less than 50 per cent . during the same period . It is to be hoped that the Senate will show more discrimination than the House in this matter of making new States Senator - Voorhees has recovered from the lucid interval with which he was mysteriously afflicted when the repeal of the Sherman law was before the Senate , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Thursday , to " go the Sherman law several- worse " and play . the mischief generally with the currency He acutely remarks th-at " no one will be surprised by my introduction of such a bill . " Neither by that nor by any other bit of demagogy on his part . The Indiana Senator talks in his large way about the bill 's being certain to pass the Senate " by a large majority " and to " cure the present deficiency in the Treasury , " but that , of course , is only part of the farce All he wants to do is to prove to his followers of the baser sort that he is just the same old Voorhees that he always was , and that his heart still beats true to all that is wild and dangerous in finance He thinks hiS ridiculous bill will do that , and if it is never heard of again , as we believe it never will be , it wo n't trouble him in the least . - The official returns of the election in this State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely to Maynard 's candidacy . The majority against - him exceeds 101,000 , while the highest majority against any other candidate on the Democratic ticket is only a little more than 25,000 . It is very plain from these figures that it was Maynard 's candidacy which pulled down the entire ticket , for - it is strictly within the bounds of moderation to say that the entire adverse majority against the other candidates on the ticket was cast by Democrats who were so indignant over Maynard 's nomination that they voted the straight Republican ticket . It would be necessary for only 12,500 Democrats to do this to bring about the result recorded . Undoubtedly a great many more than- that number did so , for the fact that Maynard was beaten by 76,000 more votes than any other Democratic candidate shows how strong the Democratic opposition to him was . The surprising thing , under the circumstances , is , that the remainder of the ticket fared as well as it did The sentence of John Y. McKane , the boss of Coney Island , to thirty days in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ county jail for contempt of court , in disregarding an injunction , at the time of-the regent election , will be welcomed by all good citizens The only regret will be that the punishment for such an offence can not be more severe , the extreme penalty having been - inflicted But criminal proceedings have also been instituted against him , and there are strong hopes that he may ultimately have to suffer an adequate penalty for his crimes Meanwhile it is a consolation that the scandal of his serving as a Sunday-school superintendent is to be abated for a month . One of the commonest forms of flattery of the American people , by politicians , is the assertion that " they are the most confiding people on the face of the earth . " Croker evidently holds this view , for he printed an interview in the Sunday morning papers which is a wonderful attempt on popular credulity . As we have often pointed out , the only subject on which Croker , Gilroy , and the like , can possibly give the public any information is the source and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Croker 's opinions , for instance , about the new anti-Tammany movement can be interesting only to people who expect him publicly to . declare that it is good and formidable . And did any rational man expect him to admit that Tammany government was wasteful , and that blackmail was levied on liquor-dealers or gamblers , and that there was politics in the School Board , and that it would be a good thing for the Legislature to investigate the city departments ? What he says on these subjects is what everybody knew beforehand he would say . It is only when he begins to talk about his own wealth and " position " that his talk becomes interesting. - What his " position " is , he never mentions , but he speaks of resigning it , and not resigning it , and of " his duty to Tammany Hall and the Democratic party to retain it " Be it remembered that he holds no public office , and has no visible means of livelihood , and yet he talks as if he were mayor of the city or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ? What are its powers and duties ? Is it a salaried " position " ? What is the salary ? Who pays it9 These are questions to which his answers , if truthful , would be very instructive . With regard to his wealth , his confidence in the popular simplicity is almost amusing . We have his own oath that in 1888 he was a poor man He has a stock farm now worth , he says , $250,000 . He has a house which cost , he says , 880 , - 000 He has race-horses which , he says , - won $91,000 last year , evidently hoping we will believe that it was these winnings which put him in possession of the horses . But no man sets up racing stable , buys a large stock farm and an 880,000 house who does not feel himself a very wealthy man RaCing and keeping stock-farms , far from being money-making employments , are , in fact , the amusements of very rich people . It is true there is a mortgage of 850,000 on the $80,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was bought , probably in some temporary financial stress Moreover  --  and this is the most important thing of all  --  this sudden accumulation of wealth was coincident with the acquisition by Tammany of complete control of the city and of the Legislature The Richmond Dispatch comes clown heavily on the proposed State-bank laws of Virginia and of the other Southern States which have passed or - are medis tating such laws . It can see no points of superiority in any of them over the present national-banking law , except , perhaps , in greater facilities for enabling speculators to get away with the money ' of a confiding public . As regards the bill pending in the committee on banking and- currency at Washington for the issue of State-bank notes , it says very correctly that not a single bank would be established . under it , or a single note issued , because the old system would be better The new Georgia bank law gets a deserved whack also . This law provides that the capital of the banks shall be divided into two parts , one half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halves shall be locked up tightly before the bank begins business In all these State-bank laws there is one controlling idea  --  the idea of the slot-machine . You drop in gold dollars ( first invested in bOnds ) , and then paper dollars come out There is no - economy in that except in the mere matter of luggage , paper being lighter than gold The object of banking is to offset debts with credits , with just sufficient gold to insure continuous solvency . This is effected with a variety of instrumentalities , of which the bank-note is one The true theory of banking is as foreign to the slot-machine methods as it is to the Eleusinian mysteries . - Yet whenever a State legislature sets itself to work to frame a new banking law or to amend an old one , it begins as a child does with a tin savings bank that it has received as a Christmas present . It impounds the bank 's capital and then tells it to go ahead . The present national-banking law is subject to the same criticism . Mr. Danirosch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his struggle with the Musical Mutual Protective Union , which succeeded in preventingshim from giving a concert on Sunday evening . He is making the same fight which Theodore Thomas made several years ago , and which every conductor who tries to maintain a competent orchestra will have to make until the-power of this - union is broken Mr Thomas was subjected to constant annoyance for years , and was put to heavy expenses in various legal proceedings in his efforts to recruit his orchestra with satisfactory players without first obtaining the con- ? sent of the union So long as the union 's rule that no musmian shall be allowed to play with its members until after a residence of six months in this country is in force , conductors are practically estopped from bringing from Europe such artists as they consider necessary for their orchestras As the union is controlled by mes who are not artists , but very indifferent musicians , their rule acts as a compulsion upon conductors to accept the services of unfit or second-rate players . They place the fine upon their members for playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ruin for members to incur it The members of Mr. Damrosch 's orchestra endeavored to get him to assume the risk of their fines , but he very prOperly refused to do so . The consequence is that his men are put to the alternative of either abandoning the union or their contracts for - twenty- five weeks ' employment at good . - wages At present they- say they will Stand by the union and remain idle rather - than abandon the union and retain employment . Under these conditions they can expect no sympathy from the public , - for the-y are suffering in an unjust and indefensible-cause .
