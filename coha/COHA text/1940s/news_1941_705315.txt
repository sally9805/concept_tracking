From Tim w ALL SCR ear JOCRSAL Detroit Bureau DETROIT  --  Basic demand for new cars and trucks could decline measurably from present high levels well before the current model year ends next September without surprising some automotive officials here . This viewpoint is being expressed despite the fact that there is nothing tangible in sight to ' foreshadow any such change in trend . To the contrary , sales are running at a new high rate for this month ? lust as they have in each month since the cur'rent model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable , but not measurable , part of the current and recent buying of new vehicles naturally has been anticipatory conservative sales leaders stress . Volume , they say , has been spurred by such factors as ( a Fears that the defense program would result in curtailed automobile production and a consequent car ' shortage ; /2 ) expectations , already partially realized , that car prices would be higher , and ( 3 ) belief that new models in the forthcoming 1942 season would not be greatly changed from the 1941s . " Borrowed " From Future To whatever extent sales have been based on these factors , they have " borrowed " volume from future months . Thus , despite the prospeciiVa ' cumulative . increases in industrial employment and purchasing power and the consequent opening up of additional demand for new cars , there is no expectation in industry quarters that the current sales pace can be continued indefinitely . Auto deliveries to consumers this month probably will aggregate between 333,000 and 345.000 units , more than 20% above January 1940 and also well above the previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is indicated by reports to Detroit area factories that normally sell about 90% of the cars sold in the domestic market . I Sales of 14 leading makes during the brat 20 days aggregated 203,000 units ( partly estimated ) . 21% above the 167,000 of the like 1940 period and off only 12% from the 227,000 of first 20 days of December , which also set a new high for that month . The same makes had sales of 109,000 units in the second 10 days of January . 22% more than the 89.000 deliveries of a year ago and only 9% less than the 119 , ' 000 of a month ago Seasonally , January sales could be expected to decline about 22% from December . Last year the decline was 21% . January Better Than Expected The January demand is running somewhat stronger than had been expected , with the result that production estimates again have been stepped up . The question of when retail sales will slacken is as unanswerable as the question of when production will be curtailed because of the armament program 's prior needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural moderation or sales may occur in time to obviate any possible need fc ? arbitrary diversion of automotive supplies or labor to arms production . This viewpoint is fairly representative of officials concerned primarily with purchasing and production and sales but is perhaps less typical of administrative executives who necessarily are In closer touch with official Washington views . Assemblies of cars and trucks in United States and Canadian factories this month probably will aggregate around 525,000 units , a new high , it was forecast by Ward 's Reports , Inc .. in the second upward revision this month of the current outlook . This total is 15% above the previous January mark , established last year , and is the highest total for any month since May , 1937 , Ward 's pointed out . Not since March , 1929 , has the volume in any first quarter month topped the 500,000 mark . Output is continuing firm at the abnormally high level held since the first of the month , with assemblies this week being estimated at 121,948 units . This compared with 124,025 last week and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While training programs are being expanded and employment standards somewhat lowered in the Detroit area , the present shortage of workers in many skilled and semi-skilled occupations here probably will become more acute by spring . This is because several large plants that have been in the construction and tooling stages for the past six to nine months , are scheduled to start swinging into mass production and will need several thousand workers ' by that time . This prediction is made by the Michigan ' Unemployment Compensation Commission in a current labor market report . Among the plants which it mentions as nearing the productive stage are Ford 's new airplane engine plant , which is to employ 10.000 workers . It will be ready for installation of equipment by late March . Bendix is to begin production of aircraft carburetors and landing gear struts here by February . The General Motors Saginaw steering gear 's machine gun plant , which is tp employ 2.500 to 3,000 workers , is to be completed in February . An addition to the WilcoxRich plant of Eaton Manufacturing Co. in Saginaw will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.600 . The Unemployment Commission 's report also points out that the pinch of material shortages has delayed construction of plants in this state in at least three instances . Shortages of structural steel have delayed work on the new plants of Dow Chemical Co. in Bay City and Extruded Metal Co. at Belding . Lack of plywood delayed the production of the Century Bnat Co .. which is manufacturing assault boats , for three weeks . Factors that could mitigate the growing demand in the Detroit area for skilled and semiskilled labor , the commission says , would be : ( I ) Curtailment of non-defense production ; ( 2 ) Expansion of existing governmental and private Industry training programs ; t3 ) relaxing of color and age standards by employers . ( 4 ) simplification of skilled jobs so they can be handled by inexperienced workers . ( 5 ) importation of suitable labor . How limited may be the supply of skilled and semi-skilled workers available in Detroit for manufacturing occupations is shown by a recent survey of the Unemployment Commission . This showed 62,403 men and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 9,000 were male adults under 50 years of age and classifiable as available for skilled and semiskilled manufacturing occupations .
