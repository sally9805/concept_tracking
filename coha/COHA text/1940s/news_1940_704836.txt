txt Senator 's Candidacy His Record in Upper House Is Cited as Evidence of Strength To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The conclusion which your editorial of June 29 indicates that you have arrived at in relation to Senator as a candidate for Vice President omits as a basis some rather essential facts and contains one criticism which is entirely unjustified . As to the votes which Senator has cast and which you criticize , all of them were on measures as to which reasonable men have differed , and , in connection with some , now differ and will continue to differ in the future . There is no charge that Senator 's votes did not accord with his sincere convictions . As to each of these measures , division in , the Senate was not on party lines . You object to Senator because he is a protectionist . The Republican , party is a protectionist party . There has been a protective tariff plank in every platform from 1860 to 1940 , including both , the statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tariff protection for agriculture , labor and industry , as essential to our American standard of living . " The Republican party can scarcely be criticized for nominating a candidate who has been consistently in accord with his party 's platform . The tariff position of the Republican party is an issue this year , as it always has been , but a Republican can scarcely be criticized for the specific act of being faithful to the party 's position on any subject . In your summation you omit facts of common knowledge which have to do with Senator 's high standing in the party and among the people . First , courage : In 1936 Senator came up for re-election . The advocates of the Townsend plan were very strong in Oregon . Substantially onethird of the voters were members of Townsend clubs . Practically every other candidate for a major office in Oregon made some sort of a compromise with the Townsendites . Senator refused to make any . Nevertheless , although President Roosevelt carried the State by over 140,000 , Senator was re-elected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and voted for Senator on the Republican ticket . Second , his record as a student of the farm policy : Senator was one of the first to recognize that there was a farm problem . He advocated a remedy at a time when possibly the majority of those in public life were denying that there was even a problem . We shall never know whether the bill was an answer in whole or in part . It passed Congress , but President Coolidge vetoed it ; neither the Republican nor the Democratic party endorsed the idea in its 1928 platform , and both President Hoover and President Roosevelt had other proposed solutions , but the country now realizes that Senator was right when he said there was a farm problem , and even those who disagree with his proposed remedy respect him for his intelligent and helpful interest in the problem . Third , among legislators he stands at the head of those interested in forest conservation : Commencing with the Clarke-qzmcq#Nary law , every law relating to forest conservation now on the statute books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name as the Senate introducer . Forest conservation is a matter of interest to the entire country , and its progress owes more to Senator than to any other one man now in public office . It would he easy to give other details in connection with Senator 's useful service . He has been the Republican leader or assistant leader in the Senate for more than fifteen years . His success as leader during an especially trying period is universally recognized . He has - the respect and confidence not only of his party associates but of his Democratic opponents as well . Such respect and confidence are never given in the Senate to an unfit man . In choosing Senator as its candidate for Vice President the party made no mistake . On the contrary , it is to he congratulated . WILLIAM S. BENNET . New York , July 1 , 1940 . Snowballs in Bulk Recommended To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : It is distressing to see the widespread defeatist attitude among the most ardent British sympathizers , the " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a snowball in hell " state of mind . Mr. Willkie , according to the experts , had n't the chance of a snowball in hell either . But he did n't dissolve in tears and sit at home listening to the reports of the convention over the radio . What this country needs is a little fighting spirit , a willingness to throw its weight into a cause that is n't a cut and dried sure thing , and by its efforts to help bring about a victory . Enough snowballs would freeze hell over . MARION HART . New York , June 29 , 1940 . Due Observance Called For To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK Miss : The Fourth of July is approaching again . We shall celebrate the birthday of our democracy at a time when democratic forms of government are being crushed . What is being done to interest our youth in the celebration of this day ? Not long ago it was the big day of the year , with its firecrackers , parades and fireworks displays . Now the firecrackers are prohibited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displays are provided only in scattered centers . In place of these demonstrations , what is being substituted to help express the people 's delight in the freedom this country offers ? Can it be that we take democracies for granted , when in reality they are the most difficult governments to establish and the most complex and precarious to maintain ? Can it be that we are tired of having to make important decisions , and are ready to have a few persons do our thinking for us and tell us what we must do ? We need to be educated to believe that we are the government . Any improvements that need to be made in our country can be brought about by expressing ourselves through our government . The youth of today must realize that the fate or the glory of this country lies in their hands . Let us rejoice on the Fourth . R. C. MrrcaLar . Burlington , Vt. , July 1 , 1940 . Economy Urged in Defense Nazi Formula of Total Effectiveness Is Recommended for Use Here To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contempt , but they should credit him with being able to face a fact  --  a singularly difficult feat for them . Hitler has literally furnished the rest of the world with blueprints of the most effective methods for building a war machine . These lessons are not yet being taken fully to heart . A case in point is the recent order placed by the United States Government for 3,000 Rolls-Royce type airplane motors  --  luxury motors at a luxury price of $15,000 each . Power plants of such superb quality are undoubtedly a sound investment when fitted to commercial airliners , where reliability and long life are of paramount importance . However , $15,000 motors are unwarranted in military planes likely to see war service . The probable life span of warplanes is much too short to call for anything but relatively short-lived , inexpensive motors . In the event that a plane outlasts its engine , quick replacement with a new power unit is very feasible . The Nazis have already proved that to their own satisfaction , if not to ours . In military procurement circles the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This peacetime point of view must now give way to the exigencies of real preparedness . Too many of us in this country have the feeling that our resources , material and human , are virtually unlimited . Such is far from being the case in the field of skilled labor . And it should be kept in mind that only the most skilled craftsmen can build motors of Rolls-Royce quality . There never have been enough mechanics of such caliber even in peacetime . Any manufacturer who has been in the market for men of superior technical skill is well aware of the scarcity . How much more acute will the shortage become when the war preparedness program swings into high gear ! The Nazi formula has always been , " Maximum total effectiveness regard-. less of unit effectiveness , if necessary . " It may well be left to Hitler to apply with characteristic ruthlessness the law of diminishing returns . It 's high time we did too . JOSEPH L. GALE . New York , July 1 , 1940 . German Refugees in France To THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your editorial " Asylum for Refugees . " It is unnecessary to emphasize how right you are with this statement . As a refugee who knows all groups of the German emigration very well , I would like to complete your utterances . Your editorial contains eight names of exiles now in danger in France . Without regard to endangering these exiles by denomination , it must be settled that all eight names are names of Communists who defended the pact between Stalin and Hitler . You are not right if you say that Dr. Hermann Budzislawsky succeeded Ossietzky. as editor of Die Weltbiihne . Ossietzky was succeeded by Willy Schlamm , who is now in New York . There are many other German refugees in France who are much more in. danger there than those you named , refugees who were against all totalitarian regimes irrespective of political colors . As you probably know , there appeasin Oslo besides the Nazi papers only the Communist newspapers . I think that the deliverance of these non-Communist German and other refugees is even more important than that of the Cornmunists . JULIUS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some Critics Criticized To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TucrEs : We have admitted that from a defense standpoint we stand naked before the world , and we are now hurriedly striving to forge a respectable suit of armor which will take some time to construct and that for a long while will have some weak spots in it . We also agree that there should he plenty of propaganda to inform the people of their possible danger and egg them on to the great effort . Nevertheless , I am one of many who believe that it is disgraceful for some of our " wise " writers and speakers to continue not only to air our weaknesses and foolishnesses , but also to offer all sorts of suggestions how we can be attacked in this or that situation . I also think that recently published pictures , showing how America could be invaded , are so good that they might easily find interest in Wilhelmstrasse and mayhap fill in some gaps in blueprints which are in the archives there .
