txt Broad intimations that Marshal Henri Philippe Petain 's government at Vichy was giving away the French Empire piecemeal to the aggressor nations , and a warning that the relations of the United States with Vichy , and with French colonial governments , would be guided by the measure in which they resisted the Axis powers , were contained in a formal statement made here today by Acting Secretary of State Sumner Welles . Again describing France 's acquiescence to Japanese demands for the military occupation of French Indo-China as a threat to American security , Mr. Welles made his statement at almost precisely the same hour that the Vichy Cabinet was believed to be meeting and resisting German demands for the handing over of bases at Dakar , Algiers and Casablanca . The pronouncement from the acting head of the Department of State was interpreted not only as a warning to the Vichy regime , but also as a measure that might stiffen the resistance of Marshal Petain 's Cabinet against German demands  --  if such resistance were actually being offered . Reports Details Received Details of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Welles declared , and the terms virtually turn over to Japan an important portion of the French Empire . Japan is ' known to have territorial ambi ' tions , the statement continued , and the Vichy action in permitting foreign troops to enter Indo-China is characterized as being " beyond the scope of any known agreement , " and giving Japan bases from which she will be in a position to conduct military operations against what are termed " other peoples friendly to the people of France . " Mr. Welles bluntly reminded the Vichy regime of the breaking of promises not to cooperate with any of the Axis powers any more than it was compelled to cooperate by the terms of last year 's armistice . He rejected Vichy 's excuse for the agreement with Tokyo , saying that the United States was unable to believe that there was any outside threat to the integrity of IndoChina except the expansionist policy of Japan . Recalling that the French in Syria did not resist German and Italian encroachments there , but did fight when the British undertook defense operations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the Vichy government really intended to preserve for the French people territories both in Europe and abroad that had long been integral portions of the French Empire . Although the Acting Secretary 's carefully worded statement contains no direct threat of severance of relations with Vichy if the Petain regime gives away any more French colonies , it leaves the way open for the United States to establish any relations it may see fit with any portion of the French territories that may resist the consummation of any abandonment to an Axis power similar to Vichy 's recent abandonment of Indo-China to occupation by the Japanese military . Talks With Envoys Asked if Japan had issued an ultimatum to Vichy before landing troops and taking naval possession of Indo-China 's harbors , Mr. Welles said he must decline to discuss that aspect of the case . Ques4 tioned concerning Germany 's roil ported pressure upon Vichy to obtain the use of African bases , Mr. Welles significantly replied that he had nothing to say about that matter at the moment , and he gave the same reply to a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale of oil and gasoline to Japan . There had , as yet , been no official reaction from Tokyo on the reduction of gasoline and oil sales to Japan , he said . He also declined to comment , at the moment , upon Japan 's reported attempts to induce or force Thailand to grant the use of air bases and to give Japan a ? monopoly on exports of rubber , tin and rice . Within an hour after issuing his warning statement addressed to Vichy , Mr. Welles conferred with the British Ambassador , Viscount Halifax ; with Richard G. Casey , the Australian Minister , and with Ralph Close , the Minister from the Union of South Africa . It is understood that with all three diplomats he discussed possible Axis moves in Africa , the Japanese seizureof French Indo-China , and reported Japanese pressure against Thailand . It is believed that careful consideration was given to possible parallel United States and British moves to curb Japanese expansion .                   @ @
