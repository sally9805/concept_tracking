IN A little Southern town an incident had occurred , and I wanted to find out about it . Beyond the highway sign that proclaims it a " good place to live , " the town first clusters round the Confederate memorial square and then sprawls east to the bottoms , where the Negroes live in a ghetto of mud and frame . I was told that in former times the square was a pleasant place , with the stores fronting on it , and the white townspeople , outnumbered two to one by the black , congregating there and indulging in pleasantries and arguing about hunting dogs . They even passed some of their raillery with the Negroes who in the evenings and on Saturdays lined the curbing on the north side of the square . But all this was changed when I reached the town a few days before the national election . The square was brittle with tension . People went about with bowed heads and strained faces . There was little business in the square , and even the low buildings seemed to shrink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now is hang a crepe , " Flap Conroy said . " Yes , sir . A big , black crepe . " Conroy said this bitterly in a husky whisper from the side of his mouth . He leaned over the chest-high partition before his cash register and cut his eyes down the dim length of the pool room , where three men were shouting pool in a frozenglare of yellow light . Flap was a short , rotund , coffee-brown man , whose trousers sagged beneath his protuberant belly , and whose eyes were like nicked marbles . He was a gambler of sorts and he had been a ladies ' man . His name , Flipflap ( Flap for short ) , derived from the peculiar action of his lips , the most immense lips I had ever seen . His upper teeth were entirely of gold , and he jabbed ruthlessly at them with a shaved match stick . " So they told you I was n't scared an ' you come to me ? " " Well , " I said hesitantly . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he were angry with me . This I found to be his usual manner of speaking . " The biggest majority of ' em 's scared . I seen you goin ' to Doc Pogue 's , an ' about five minutes later I seen you leaving there an ' goin ' like you was goin ' to the school , an ' I wondered who you was . Then a little while ago Scotty Grace come in here an ' told me you was some feller goin ' round finding out about people . Aw , aw , ' I said to myself . ' I know good an ' damn well he ai n't goin ' a find out nothing ' bout them guys . ' Them fellers think that every stranger comes to town is trying to stuff ' em home way or another , sticking his nose in the mobbing . Well , I ai n't scared . It takes me to tell you . " He narrowed his eyes and rested his elbows on the partition . I got a stool from against the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full days I had met fear , suspicion , silence . The townspeople watched me with open mistrust . I felt that I was the subject of discussion among the whites on the square . " I ai n't scared , " Flap said . " Just remember that . I was bred an ' born an ' raised here . My home place is only ' bout five miles east o ' here . The boy I rent it to just come in Friday an ' handed me my compress receipts . I rent it for three bales . It 's just short of seventy acres , but by the time we ' vide up three bales ten ways we ai n't got nothing . Yeah . Nine brothers an ' sisters I got . But it 's our place . That 's one reason I ai n't scared . I know I got some place to scram when scramming time comes . The high sheriff , Top Zuber , come in here this fall an ' started hinting round ' bout the ' lection coming up . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scare me . I ai n't saying I would n't go if the turf got too tight ; but I got a home place to go to . I 've lived in the North , I 've lived in Shy and K.C. , but I do n't see nothing to living in them places . Yeah , you can vote . But when you come right down to it , what the hell 's that ? All you got to do is ask a nigger who votes if he 's still working for his living ; an ' that shows ' em that voting ai n't nothing special . Course I 'm for voting ! / b'lieve if white folks got it niggers ought to git it too . This ai n't their doggone country exclusive . But niggers ai n't never voted here , not even in the President election , an ' they been doin " bout as good , when it comes down to bread an ' butter , as niggers most anywheres else . Just the same I was with them when they started the voting agitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all colored together an ' we got to stick together regardless . " But now the pecks has got ' em scared , an ' the closer this ' lection comes the scareder they git . Both sides is scared . White folks scared the niggers goin ' a make a break , an ' niggers scared white folks goin ' a think they making a break . But I ai n't scared , buddy . Anybody round here'Il tell you Flipflap ai n't scared o ' nothing . " Here 's how all this stuff started . " There was a coupl ' a men round here started up some kind of lodge . These men 's names were Benny Speed an ' Link Cave . I did n't know much what it was all about , but I was in it . It was a secret lodge . We held meetings secret . Benny Speed was president , an ' he said we had to do that till we got organized right . We did n't want the pecks to break us up ' fore we got started good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had one white-folks ' nigger in there ? Tilson Huett , the school principal . He ai n't nothing but a snake . Knowed him all my life . Knowed his pappy before him , an ' his pappy was the same . Tilson was born an ' raised here . Went to school here . Been here all his life . He 's a so -- 'n ' - so snake ! " When we got organized good we started agitating for voting . We ai n't never voted here , in no kind a ' lection , they tell me , since eighty-four . So five of us was picked to go up to the courthouse to see about it . They kneW we was coming . Yeah . Tilson Huett had told them . " When we went on up they was ready for us . Before we could open our mouths to say boo Mr. Reid said , ' You men might 's well save your breath . The answer 's no . We do n't never ' tend to let niggers vote in this county . tell you boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in blood . ' That 's what he told us . " We told him we did n't want to vote for mayor an ' sheriff , just President , an ' he said colored could n't even vote for that , not in this county . ' Smoke this in your pipe , ' he said . ' I know niggers . I been knowing niggers all my life , an ' if we give you a inch you want a mile . If we let you vote in the President election you 'd want to vote in every other kind election . Well , let me tell you boys something : President Roosevelt ai n't running this county . ' " There was a gang of men round in his office , an ' more come in . Such signifyin ' you never saw ! Top Zuber was one of them . He had n't been long voted high sheriff , but he was n't in yet . Yet an ' still he was packing a rod . I seen it . He meant for us to see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking , an ' if Top Zuber thought he was scaring him , he had another thought coming . Benny was n't built like a gorilla for nothing . An ' Link Cave , he was a preacher , an ' he was n't scared o ' nothing but God . Top Zuber was trying to put a scare in the wrong set o ' niggers . " Anyway , he puts in his mouth . You-all darkies better git on back to the bottom , ' fore you stir up something , ' he said . He 's a slow-talking white man . Take him all day to say good morning . Right away , soon 's he opened his mouth , Benny stepped in it . Benny says , Mr. Zuber , you ai n't got a dog in this fight . You ai n't sheriff yet . ' Top said something ' bout giving us fair warning , an ' showed his gun again . Then Mr. Reid spoke up an ' said he knew what it was all about , knew all about the lodge . Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You-all boys has let some dangerous Northern nigger come in here an ' fill you full o ' talk , ' he says . ' Then he goes on ' bout his business an ' leaves you holding the bag . I found out all about it . I found out when he come an ' when he left . ' " He was talking ' bout Benny Speed 's boy , little Ben . Little Ben had come here from New York on a visit , an ' you know how they call on home folks in church who 've been away to say something . That 's all it was . He gave a little inspiration talk in church one Sunday . Do n't know what it was , but it could n't been nothing special , ' cause I did n't hear nobody talking ' bout it much . " Well , we argid back an ' forth an hour or more , an ' when we left we was n't no more scared than we was when we went in . In fact , we was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of there , an ' we did n't know ' em before . But we still did n't know what to do . Link Cave was all for writing to the President . ' He 's for ekal rights , ' he said . He 'll do something about it . ' An ' everybody said first one thing an ' then another , but nobody knowed what to do next . " You know , I kind a b'lieve if that so'n ' - so Huett had n't spilled it , we could of got what we went in there for . Took ' em by surprise like , you see . But there 's a nigger like him in every bunch . Yeah . If you see two niggers walking down the street together you can bet your mamma 's last pair of drawers that one of them runs to the crackers with everything . An ' the white man knows it ! That 's what makes it bad . He knows that if two niggers know something that the white folks ai n't s'posed to know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I run this pool room , see ? Guys come in here right frequent an ' want to borrow fi ' dollars on a suit or a watch , anything they can raise some cash on . I ai n't s'posed to run no pawn business , but that 's what it comes to . Had a feller git II ' dollars on a suit once . I told him if he did n't git it in thirty days , I was subject to sell it . Friend o ' mine , too . Thirty days went by an ' he did n't come git his suit . I saw Stud one day up on the Square , an ' I says , ' Stud , what ' bout that suit ? " Aw , git the suit , ' he says , just like that . ' Bout two weeks later , I come here one morning an ' he had both the laws waiting for me . He had figgered to git his clothes without paying me , so he had went to the law an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I ai n't that dumb . He did n't have no tickets . I told the law I 'd bought the suit off him , an ' I 'd sell it back to him . Sure . I 'd sell it back to anybody . They did n't do nothing but walk right on out o ' here . " But that 's the way one nigger in every two will do . Tilson Huett told them pecks everything , an ' then some ! What our plans was , who was officers , where we met at , everything . When he joined up , that nigger knew what he was going to do . II " It was Thursday when we went to see Mr. Reid . We did n't think nothing ' bout any trouble or anything . Friday my brother , C. A. , gave a big barbecue for his burial-association members . He gives one every year on the church grounds . Sometimes we have speaking , but this year he did n't have that . People just circulated ' bout on the grounds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car come right on up in the yard an ' some white men got out . Well , that was n't nothing to make admiration over . White folks come right frequent to look at us enjoy ourselves . But then we notice that they had been drinking an ' that Top Zuber was one of ' cm . " C. A. come running to me , asking me what must he do . Do ? ' I said . ' Do n't do nothing . ' ' Yeah , but they been drinking , ' he said . " ' Well , that 's all right , ' I said . ' They ai n't goin ' a do nothing an ' we ai n't gain ' a do nothing . ' But all the niggers had heard ' bout the time we had in Mr. Reid 's office an ' you could see they was n't particular ' bout having these pecks around . " ' You better say something , Flap , ' C. A. said . It was his barbecue , an ' yet an ' still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my brother , but he 's got a lot o ' chicken in him . " I got up on a table an ' told the niggers there was n't nothing to git excited about . We just had some friendly visitors . Go ahead on an ' enjoy yourselves , ' I told them . Niggers mumbled a little bit , but they went on eating , an ' after while they was n't paying any ' tention to the crackers . The pecks was standing round their car talking ' mongst themselves an ' looking . " " Was Zuber in office as sheriff then ? " I broke in . " No , man ! Him an ' his little gang was just signifying . I did n't figger they was fixing to do much else but that , ' cause if they had they 'd a most likelybrought more men with ' em . There was a gang of niggers out there that day . " After a while somebody blowed a police whistle , an ' when I looked round , I saw Top Zuber standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was weaving up there , he was just that tight , weaving an ' waving . I sent C. A. one way through the crowd an ' I went the other , telling folks , ' Do n't pay no ' tention . No matter what he says , do n't pay no ' tendon . ' Some few niggers looked at Top , but most did n't , but you could tell they was straining to listen . I was myself . They wanted to hear what he had to say , but they did n't want him to know it . One o ' the crackers round the car blowed an ' blowed that damn whistle an ' the niggers still would n't look . An ' after while f saw Top reach down an ' git the whistle from the guy on the ground an ' start blowing it himself . We was n't ready to start the fire in the other pit , but somebody started it , an ' a lot o ' niggers walked clean across the grounds an ' crowded round the fire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know what he said or if he said anything . I was way back in the crowd round the pit . I think I saw his mouth open , an ' then I seen one of the crackers on the ground git up on the running board an ' say something to him , an ' then Top stopped blowing the whistle an ' just stood up on the car with his hands on his hips looking at all the niggers an ' thinking God knows what . The man standing on the running board kept talking to him . Then after while old Top Zuber jerked his hands off his hips , like he was mad an ' disgusted , an ' climbed down , an ' they all got in the car an ' backed it off the church grounds an ' drove away . " Seems like soon 's the car was gone I could hear all the niggers draw one big breath at once . Then one old bigmouth nigger said something funny ' bout crackers going good with Brunswick stew , an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't hear him kept saying , ' What 'd he say ? What 'd he say ? ' An ' ' fore long nobody thought nothing ' bout Top Zuber no more . " Well , I thought that was the end of it , just like I thought the day before was the end of it . But pecks ca n't forgit like we can . That 's their bigger ' trouble . They just ca n't forgit ! An ' this time they had two things to remember . They had the five of us going to Mr. Reid 's office to remember , an ' they had to remember Top Zuber standing on top of a car blowing a whistle an ' trying to say something to a gang o ' niggers who was n't paying him no mind . I can see how them two things would work on the white folks ' mind . I can see that they would be insulted ' bout both things , an ' shame too . But white folks ' shame ai n't the same thing as niggers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saddee , an ' I was home in bed when some jig come an ' tried to beat my door in . You know it had to be late , ' cause I closed up here ' bout ' leven , an ' then I went to git a beer . It was when I was going down Jefferson that I seen Doc Pogue hurrying toward Jim Covington 's house an ' I thought somebody was sick . I did n't know what it was till later . It was hot that night too , an ' I figgered that that was why I did n't do no business . Yet an ' still , I felt something funny in the air . I went on down Jefferson , an ' the beer parlor was closed , an ' that struck inc funny too . Still I did n't think nothing . I went on home . " I had been in bed when this jig commenced knocking . I was just dozin ' off when the knocking come . I did n't git up at first . I yelled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flap , ' this jig says , whispering it an ' yelling too . ' Flap , a mob come an ' got Ben Speed an ' Link Cave an ' some more , ' he says . I got up on the side of the bed , an ' my wife , she sat straight up . " ' Flap ! ' my wife says . " ' Shut up , woman , ' I said , just like that . ' Let me git this straight . What they mobbed for ? ' I asked the nigger . My winder 's right on the level with the porch , an ' I did n't have to talk loud . I do n't know why I just sat on the side of the bed talking like that , ' stead o ' gitting up an ' going to the door . I was n't scared . Just surprised . " ' Did n't you go up there with them , Flap ? ' the nigger wanted to know . " ' Go where ? ' I says . " ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " ' You mean to tell me that 's what they mobbing ' em for ? ' I asked him . " ' That 's what they say , ' he says . " Aw , go ' way , nigger , ' I said , just like that . ' I do n't b'lieve you . ' " ' All right , ' this jig says . ' Do n't say you was n't warned . ' " I got up then . My wife , she was already crying , an ' my mother-in-law come in the room bringing a lamp . An ' she started raising hell about the lodge making trouble . Said she knew a thing like that was n't nothing but trouble . It was a fair so-'n ' - so around there for a while . ' Course , the first thing I did was gather up all the artillery I had . Then we all just sat there waiting in the front room with the light out , fussin ' with each other an ' waiting . Sat up all night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an ' after while she got ' cross the bed an ' fell asleep . She whinnied in her sleep all night long , an ' in between spells of whinnying everything was quiet . Was n't a sound in the road . Not even a car passed . " ' Fore day that morning , when my wife had fell ' cross the bed ' sleep an ' my mother-in-law had stopped raising hell , I sure wished for something to happen , some noise , ur something . A coup ! ' a times I thought I heard something , an ' I sat just as still waitin ' for it to come again , an ' then when it did n't come , not hearing nothing was badder than ever . Yeah . I was n't scared . But just setting knowing that if I did hear a noise it might be them coming to mob me , an ' wanting to hear a noise so bad that I almost did n't give a goddamn , well , that was crazy . " Nobody went to church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't come to town at all . All that day we sat in the house . ' Bout dark , Montrose Williams come to our back an ' she give us the first news . But she did n't know nothing much . She had been to work . Her white folks had come for her an ' brought her back , an ' all she knowed was that the law was n't letting no niggers in town ' less they was with white folks . She said her white folks told her that the mob was n't goin ' a lynch Ben an ' Link , just drive ' em out a town . She said Benny an ' Link was the onlies ' two they was after . She said her white folks said they guess the mob just wanted to make a ' example . She said things was gifting back to normal in town again . When she went to work that morning , white folks was off the street just like colored , but when she come back in the evening there was some on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' when I went to bed I slep ' some . IV " Monday I come on to town as usual . I did n't leave the house till nine o'clock , an ' there was plen'y people on the street . Them who had always spoke to me , spoke to me , an ' nobody looked any different . " But when I got here , Paul Whitney , the day law , was waiting at the door for me . We been knowing each other all our lives . But I was n't dealing no cards to no kind a cracker in that damn game that morning . Knowing him did n't matter a damn to me . He was white . That 's all I knowed ! " ' Flap , ' he says , ' let 's go upstairs . I got some talk for you . Better lock your door . I do n't want nobody to come in . ' " ' Why ca n't we talk down here , Paul ? ' I asked him . " There 's a little attic room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I was n't thinking ' bout that . I was thinking ' bout him trying to play some trick . " ' I just want it to be secret , ' he said . " I said , ' You do n't mind if I take my gun , do you ? ' " " Course not , Flap , ' he says . I swear to God , Flap , if it was n't for me knowing you so well , I 'd b'lieve you did n't trust me . ' " I did n't say nothing . I come on back behind here an ' got my gun an ' we went on upstairs , him walking ahead . There was four or five suits hanging up there , an ' some shoes on the floor , an ' automobile tars , an ' batt'rics , an ' a set o ' suit cases . But he did n't say nothing . " ' Flap , ' he said , ' I got a message for you . You knowed they runned some boys out a town Saddee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowed it , ' I said . " ' Well , they did n't do nothing to ' em . Just took ' em over the county line an ' told them to stay out . They was n't aiming to hurt ' em . ' " ' Well , I 'm glad a that , ' I said . " I was waiting an ' watching . I was looking him in the face , but I seen him all over . Seem like to me he had shrunk up or something , an ' I could see all of him just by looking in his face . " ' Yeah , ' he says . ' I 'm glad as I can be , Flap . There ai n't no sense in mobbing . ' " I did n't say nothing . He took his stick an ' kind a brushed the clothes with it . I was looking in his face , but I seen him soon 's he raised his stick . " ' Ben Speed 's over in Gibson , ' Paul said . " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " ' That 's where he run to after they put him out ' cross the line , ' he said . They run him out without a goddamn thing but his underwear , an ' I told him I 'd come to you an ' see would n't you go to his house an ' git him some clothes . Then you an ' me can take ' em to him . ' " ' Why do n't you do it yourself ? ' I asked him . " He hit the clothes again , an ' then kept on hitting them lightly , like he was thinking ' bout what I 'd asked him . Then he said : " ' I wisht I could , Flap . I wisht I could do it without bothering you , ' cause I know you do n't want no parts of it . But s'pose I did go down to Ben Speed 's house an ' you boys did n't know what I was going for , an ' his old woman did n't gi ' me the clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like 1 b'lieve you 're thinking maybe this is ? Would n't his old woman talk about that I was trying to lay a trap ? Then you know what would happen , Flap , next time I had to lock a colored boy up ? He would n't trust me . He 'd want to fight , an ' then I might have to shoot him , like Dawson does every time he 's got a mind to almost . I do n't want to hurt nobody , Flap . " S'pose I had to lock up Wally Spence ? You know what kind a boy he is . ' Member that time he got drunk an ' Dawson come along an ' said he was going to lock him up , an ' Wally said he 'd be goddamned if Dawson would lay a hand on him ? ' Member he kep ' hollerin ' he did n't mind going to jail , but the onliest white man who could put him in jail was me ? Heard him yelling an ' cussing clear over on Main . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hal Dawson would a shot him . S'pose / went on down there , like I said , an ' maybe tomorrer or next day I had to lock Wally up . He would n't trust me no more . He might draw a knife , an ' I might have to shoot him . I do n't want to hurt nobody , Flap . ' " All he said ' bout Wally Spence was true , ' cause I was there . But I just was n't playing no poker in a game with a white man that morning . " ' But you was with the mob last night , ' I told him . " ' You got me wrong , ' he says . ' Did n't know nothing ' bout it till I come from visiting in the country . It was night ' fore last . When I heard ' bout it I went looking for somebody who was in the mobbing , an ' he told me Ben Speed was put out north , toward Gibson , an ' Cave was put out west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought I was doubtful . He slipped that crack in there ' bout me thinking his wanting to talk to me was a trap . But who the hell would n't be doubtful ? I 'd knowed him all my life , an ' it was true that he never had beat nobody up nor shot ' em . But that morning he was just another peck to me . " ' How come Ben Speed did n't write me no note ? ' I asked him . " ' We just did n't think of it , I guess , ' he said . " I studied it a little bit longer , an ' then I told him O.K. , I 'd git Ben 's clothes , an ' then he asked me to have ' em at three o'clock , when he come off duty , an ' he 'd come on by here an ' git ' em . He asked me was I goin ' with him when he took ' em , an ' I told him no , but if Ben would write me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he left . " Sure ' nough , I did git a letter from Ben asking me to loan his wife some money so she could git herself together an ' git out a town . They went on up to somewhere in Maryland .

" ' Course everybody felt better when they found out they had n't laid their hands on ' em to kill ' em . Yet an ' still , it was bad stuff just the same . " Ben an ' Link was the onliest ones they chased out , but they was n't the onliest ones that Ieft . A gang o ' folks pulled up an ' went . Scared ! But them that stayed was on the streets again an ' doing their work .

V " That next Saddee things was some better , but colored folks did n't hang round none . Country niggers come to town , bought what they had to buy , an ' got on back out . Did n't hang round till dark as usual . I did n't rack up more'n two or three games that whole day . There just was n't no business . I did have three or four guys to come in an ' git their guns . Some of them did n't have the money I 'd loaned ' em , but I was n't holding out in no times like them .

I ai n't saying it to build him up an ' make you think what happened was worse than it was . Most anybody 'll tell you Clarence Huett was just a good boy . It would of been bad enough if it was anybody , without going round making it worse by saying it happened to some little black Jesus . Clarence was n't no Jesus . He was just naturally a good , hard-working boy . " I was n't at prayer meeting . I go to church Sundays , but through the week I 'm busy down here an ' I ca n't go .

They say he preached a reg'lar sermon . " There was only one thing wrong with that testimony . Tilson Huett was there an ' heard it . Yeah ! But you see , nobody knew ' bout him then .

I was n't home , but my wife an ' mother-in-law was setting on the porch . Clarence lived right next to us , ' bout as far as that first table . That night a car drove up the road . It was loaded with men , but my women folks did n't pay no ' tention to that . They did n't think nothing ' bout they might be white men . That other trouble had been over near ' bout three weeks , an ' nothing had n't happened to make nobody think something else was coming up . The women folks did n't know they was white men till they seen this mechanic from the laundry git out . They seen him then an ' they thought he had come to git Clarence to go to work . " ' Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the peck say . An ' Faydelta said something , an ' then the peck said , ' That 's all right . Tell him to slip on some pants an ' come Iike he is . ' Then he went on back to the car . " My women folks seen Clarence walk out to the car , an ' then all at once he stopped right short , an ' then got in the back seat slow . If he said anything nobody heard him . But when he got in the back seat Faydella ran out with the lamp in her hand an ' got there just when the car was pulling off , an ' either the car hit her an ' knocked her down or somebody in the car reached out an ' knocked her down , ' cause she fell an ' caught on fire from the lamp , an ' my wife an ' mother-in-law put the fire out . Faydella kept saying , ' Top Zuber was driving . Top Zuber was driving , ' my wife said . My wife said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was burning in little flames in a dozen places . " The bottom was buzzing when I got home . Looked like the niggers was coming together on this thing . There was a gang a them at Clarence 's house . But they could n't git straight on nothing . Some was of one way of thinking an ' some was another . Some wanted to go out looking for Clarence , an ' some said it was n't no use ? he 'd be all right , they was n't goin ' a hurt him . Some argid this an ' some argid that , an ' the outcome was that nobody done nothing but set there . Was n't nothing but the niggers from right round in that section . I guess the folks over in Hoptown section had n't heard about it yet . It was a more quiet mobbing then the other . " The women an ' kids was setting out in the kitchen an ' us men in the front room . Long ' bout two o'clock folks started drifting off . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to the kitchen an ' then he 'd call his wife an ' kids , an ' you 'd know that he was going on home . Only me an Scotty Grace an ' Ginnie Oxley , an ' Fay &lla's; brother , Russ , stayed till morning . Then I went on ' cross home . " Nobody heard nothing ' bout Clarence an ' nobody done nothing ' bout it Friday an ' Saddee . It was n't the same like it was before , ' cause this time nobody figgered they was goin ' a lay the weight of their hands on him . But by Saddee night something of the feeling of the first mobbing come back , ' cause nobody had heard nothing ' bout Clarence . In the pool room here fellers was talking ' bout it , wondering why nobody had n't heard . It commence to git on the white folks nerves too . It was n't nothing you could say just what , but it was something . " Bout ten o'clock that night , Paul Whitney come in to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not his coat , ' cause he was off duty . " ' Ai n't nobody heard from that boy yet ? ' he asked me . " ' Not to my knowing , ' I said . ' Where was you this time , Paul ? ' I asked him , sarcastic-like , but kidding him . " ' I was here , ' he says . ' I did n't know nothing about it . From what I hear , did n't many folks know nothing about it . An ' them that was s'posed to be in the car , I hear they ai n't come back yet . ' " He was leaning just where you 're setting , an ' his hands was kind a falling down on this side of the railing . It was a big scar ' cross the back of one of his hands that I had n't never noticed before . Then I noticed I had n't never noticed his eyes before nor nothing much about him . I 'd knowed him all my life an ' that night was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I seen that all his mush-mouth talk was straight talk coming from . him . Yet an ' still , I was n't satisfied . " " Souse me , Paid , ' I said , just like that . ' But that sounds like some stuff to me . That was Thursday night , an ' here it 's almost Sunday morning , ' I said . " ' I do n't know , Flap , ' he said . Then he looked like he was thinking ' bout something off yonder somewheres . Then he said , like it was n't no question till the end , ' They tell me Top Zuber was in that car , Flap ? ' " Is that so ? ' I asked him . " ' Well , ai n't nobody seen him since Thursday night . He ai n't been home . His lady friend come over from Covington yesterday , an ' she ai n't seen him . ' " ' What 's it mean , Paul ? ' I asked him . " Goddamn if I know , Flap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , just like that . VI " Sunday morning I was setting up in church with my wife an ' mother-in-law when a usher come an ' whispered in my ear that I was wanted on the outside . I went out ' course , an ' there was my brother , C. A. , an ' Paul Whitney . Yeah . C. A. said they 'd found Clarence 's body washed up out the river an ' Paul had come to ask him to take it . What must he do ? What he said hit me so hard my head swum . " ' Found his corpse in the river ! ' I said , just like that . ' How in the hell did it git in the river ? ' " ' They must a throwed it in , ' C. A. said . ' They must a lynched him . ' " Yeah , ' Paul said . ' They killed him , Flap . Goddamn if I b'Iieved they 'd kill that boy . ' " ' Must I git him ? ' C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , Flap . Honest to God ! Must I git him ? ' " ' You 're the onliest nigger undertaker in town , ai n't you ? ' I said . ' You damn right you must ! Wait a minute . I 'll go with you . ' " I went on back in church to tell my wife . But I did n't have to tell her nothing . Soon 's I walked in I seen the whole church knowed it . Everybody turned round an looked at mc , an ' then everybody seemed to know . I do n't know how they found out , but it looked like the minute they turned round they knowed . When I come back out to go with C. A. an ' Paul , the whole church come out behind me . They all wanted to go down to the river , but we would n't let ' em . " When we got down to the river with the dead wagon there was a gang o ' crackers an ' the coroner from the county . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul went up an ' spoke to the coroner . They made the crowd fall back . Then the coroner come over an ' give C. A. a permit to move the body , an ' C. A. an ' me got out the basket . " I did n't look at the corpse till we got right on it . I looked every place but right at it . Then I seen it . The boy was laying on his stomick , where they had drug him . They had beat him bad , and he had been shot in the back twice . " It was the next day that we all found out about Tilson Huett . The paper come out this time giving a history of both mobbings , an ' it told how Huett had been to the white folks to try to ' void trouble both times , an ' how the white folks had done , an ' how when this second trouble started just a few quick-tempered men had ' tended to it quiet . They called Huett a ' loyal Negro ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had most likely ' voided more serious trouble . " When I moved my feet from the rungs of the stool pain shot through my stiff knees . There was no one in the pool room now . Sometime during the long telling the men had gone . I did not remember their going . Flap went to the back and racked the balls up and spread the gray rubberized cloth over the table . He turned out the light . When he came back again I asked him about Top Zuber . " He 's high sheriff now . Yeah . In office . Been in office . " " And where was he from Thursday to Sunday ? " " You mean Tuesday . Did n't nobody see him in town till the next Tuesday , " Flap said . " Where 'd he been ? " " You got to ask somebody better'n me , " Flap said . He got down his hat and put on his street coat over the pull-over zipper sweater . He counted the change in the cash drawer and locked the drawer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took out a short-snouted automatic , which he slipped under his belt outside his sweater , handy . " Other niggers is scared , but I ai n't scared , " Flap said .
