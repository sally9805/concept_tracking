Hind style . Poor as she was , she had kept the virtue of the poor : to feed the hungry well . The long table , hung between the lockers that ran alongside the bunks , was set with a new cloth . There was good china , instead of glass , and ivoryhandledknives and forks rather than the metal ones that should serve thereafter . At each of the fourteen places , there was the deep white plate that must be used for all the courses , a custom that could n't be broken for the most honored guest . More than that , the men had made up their bunks neatly . All stray gear had been carefully stowed in the peak ; and the smelliest pipes were up there also , where the ventilator blew . This was the proper thing , according to the host laws laid down by Grandfather Doonan generations ago , who was fond of carrying Boston greenhorns to the Banks for their instructionand for his own . The cook , a venerable man of some seventy years , stood by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air of a man who had done nothing much in the day past . He failed to deceive us . We all understood that it would have been wrong if he had indicated , in any way , that something impressive had been achieved on the great Shipmate stove behind him . Once or twice he lifted his apron to touch away the beads of sweat that slid down his forehead and red cheeks . Other than that , he made no acknowledgment of labor triumphantly carried on throughout a day that was far from usual , considering its tumultuous beginning . When the table had filled up , he waited until the chatter and the laughter ceased , waited until we had assumed a respectful and expectant attitude . He then hauled around in regal style and came forward with the first immense tureen of fish chowder . This was a daring opening ; for such Gloucester vessels usually ate fish when all other stores were gone , fishp101being purposely caught for those who did n't have plenty of them . Such a practice , however , was a clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cream . This serving , at the outset of a voyage , was , therefore , cook 's challenge to himself and to the libel . One glance along the two rows of lifted faces gave him his triumph . He tasted the triumph with all the gusto that we gave to his chowder ; and then , by a series of portly turns and advances , he served three yard-square trays of beefsteaks , broiled and fried , to which he added bowls of succotash , green beans , and pan after pan of hot biscuits , all backed up with platters of butter , carved by the half-pound out of tubs . The teapots passed up and down . Nora poured for her captain and for me and passed it along . We emptied our plates of chowder and neatly scoured the dish with biscuits , which we popped into our mouths . A doryman , who had been politely waiting to show his manners , speared a steak on his fork and placed it on her plate . The Hind had n't sailed two miles before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trays appeared again , this time laden with grapes and apples ; and after them came six apple pies , nearly half a fathom wide , ranked by loaves of store cheese . The pies ran with cinnamon ; their crusts had the lightness of foam . " What you think , Cap'n Nora ? " The Lisbon , seated on the port side , asked the question . For this part of the Hind 's genial ritual , which I joyfully remembered , he had worked up a black air of dissatisfaction , mixed with famine looks . He gazed in mock despair at the lamps overhead . Nora shook her head in sadness . She , too , remembered this game of old . " Cook , " she said in a mournful way , " is not what he used to be . We must look for a new one . My fatherp102always said it would come to that in the end . And Grandfather said the same thing the other day . ' T is a great shame ! " All the slicked-up heads waggled and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cue . " Why you say that , Cap'n Nora ? " " Because  --  by the Lord Harry !  --  we 'll all be so fat we ca n't get into a dory ! " They rolled out their laughter and broke away from their places . The cook bowed solemnly and returned to his stove , where another such abundance was reaching its climax for the second table . This was the moment when Nora had to surprise them all ; and I must say that she could n't have chosen a better time ; for a good dinner enables a man to take a new thing easily . She called out : " Cook ! One moment , if you please . " He lifted a ladle in quick response . " Yes , Miss Nora ? " " There 'll be five more men to fill up the second table . " She might just as well have announced that five bull whales were coming aboard for a bite of supper and a mug of tea . One man shouted : " Hey ! " The cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the various flavors of surprise . He was , therefore , man enough to bow and say : " Five more to fill up . Certainly , Miss Nora . " He could n't , however , stop the slight widening of his eyes which was his way of asking : " How in the name of halibutdid she get five secret men aboard this vessel ? And why ? " I concealed my own knowledge with a proper look of astonishment . Here 's a strange thing : after the first moment of surprise and curiosity , the dorymen became uneasy . One man stood grotesquely with his leg flung into an upper bunk , his head twisted down . The new watch , crowding toward the corn/panionway , paused with their oil clothing on their arms . As I said , they stared at her in surprise ; and they exchanged short , quick looks which were really attempts to find out if one of their chums had already figured out the meaning of her words . Their wonderment turned to shrewdness and this , being baffledalso , changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all eyes came to one face on which they stayed fixed ; and that was the face of their skipper . Captain LeNotre had slowly lifted himself out of his place at the galley end of the starboard locker . Every man in that forecastle knew at once that their captain had n't been told about the secret men . This knowledge , added so abruptly to their fresh store of distrust for him , gave such force to their bold glances that he could n't help answering in kind . He jerked back his head from the full flush of the lamplight so that his face had the shelter of the lesser light flowing down from the deck . The blaze of his yellow hair and flat , highcoloredcheeks was thus dimmed . The anger in his eyes made them burn in the half-shadow . Nora waited for him to speak . In that anxious moment , I saw certain proof that in the canny , locked hearts of her men there was more hidden than the memory of James Corkery 's death . I looked swiftly from face to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to myself : " They do n't seem to forget their chum easily . " By that I meant , of course , that his loss should have put down deep . At once , I saw that this was a mistake in thinking . Here , once more , I found myself with a difficult sum done before I knew what had to be added and taken away . I knew absolutelythat the dorymen would not permit a captain 's mistake , even such a fatal one , to stand between them long . Habit was strong amongst them , as it should be . They lived by habit andp104steered and fished by habit ; and the most inflexible habit of all  --  the prime and ancient rule of the Gloucester fleet  --  was the habit that forced them to get rid of anything that might hamper them in their search for cod . Life lay in the cod . Oh , of course , there 's no denying that life of some sort could be found elsewhere . They could choke the years away in ' longshore factories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savory life they had lived , had become used to , and wished to follow until the end , whatever that end might be . Now , since they endangered this hope of life by their rebellious behavior , it should have become plain to me and to Nora that they were in possession of a secret , too . Had either of us been wise enough to enter their closed hearts and live completely with them , we should have seen that they believed , for one reason or another , that their captain had become a threat to all that was dear to them . Thus their mute rebellion might have been judged by us for what it was : a clumsy effort to save all  --  the Hind and the Doonans and their own way of life . This could not be made plain to us at the time because we were not sufficient in our wisdom ; and I can only say so now because of hindsight added to foresight . Captain LeNotre did n't include Nora in his strong , unflinchinggaze . When his eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all meaning out of them and let the lids fall halfway . He then turned on his heel and reached for the companionway rope . The schooner lurched . He waited in a graceful , careless pose . When the vessel came up , he swung onto the steps and climbed away . The cook 's bell clanged . A man on deck shouted : " Dinner ! Dinner ! Second gang ! " Nora climbed the steps . On deck , she waited until I came out . We heard the relieving watch repeat their orders :  |p1o5  " North-northeast ! One hour . One hour . " We breathed a noisy frost . The moon , lessened and yellowed , had passed over and was swiftly falling down . It had ceased to beam . Companiesof stars burned hard and cold where the moon had been . Black and cold , the following seas poured over the Hind 's wake . Because of all these things  --  night and cold , the words below , and the fateful landfall soon to be made  --  our hearts became chilled again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She went slowly aft through the darkness and I followed . Spray bit at our cheeks . A flurry of snow came whirlingdown the mainsail . She shivered and struck back the slide of the cabin companionway . In turning to go down , she saw that I had stopped near the helmsman . She called out : " Come along , John , will you ? " I went below after her . Captain LeNotre waited in the cabin . He had taken the same position there , that is , beyond the stove and beyond the golden circle of light from the brass lamp which swung stiffly in answer to the swaying of the schooner . I Es face had grown even harder . It was like a Hallowe'en mask nailed to the dark panels . She passed him without a word and went down into the hold . She found her old dorymen drowsing in their blankets . She called them up . I heard their cheerful answers when she said night had fallen and that their day in the hiding-place must have been a poor one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms and stamping hard with their boots , they filed past the stove and brought up , somewhat bowed and weary , between the port bunks and the companion steps . Old Ambrose gave their respectful greetings to the young captain and said : " A long kink we 've had there below ! " pI o6 " Long kink ! " repeated the man straddled behind him . Captain LeNotre returned the greeting with an air that did him credit ; for their very presence was an attack on the dignityof his office . He said : " Ambrose Cameron ! " and , a breath later : " Peter Lord ! " He spoke the others ' names in a grave tone . He spoke evenly and did not reveal anger or surprise ; that is , he carried the extraordinary meeting off in such a manner that Ambrose , for instance , might have taken it for granted that the captain had known of their presence . This was a pretense impossible to carry out for long , if he intended to do so . I watched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the talk they had heard in Gloucester concerning the Hind 's last voyage , a subject to which we had come close the night before . They gave no such sign . They stood in simple , dutiful silence , gazing into the lamp with blinks and yawns . Thus they waited for her revelation of the mystery in which they had been drawn by their need and by their devotion to her family and her vessel . I soon saw that the revelation was not to be made at this time . More than ever , Nora Noonan was aware that she had made a promise to me that she would not tell a soul about her Nova Scotian venture or tell why she chose to have five old dorymen go aboard hugger-mugger in the secrecy of dawn . She was determined that she would say nothing of it . The secret itself was to remain hers . She spoke to Captain LeNotre , and sent her words out calmly from under the sagging brim of her sou'wester . " These men are aboard the Hind , Paul , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you concerning the dory  --  so I tell you concerning them . Their names are on her list and have been given to the Coast Guard . I 've work for them to do at a certain place.  |p107Work  which I ca n't reveal to you or to them right now . Although I 'd like to tell you , Paul . I 'd like to very much . All I can say is this : that the job I have for them is a hard one . A dangerous one . It 's something that the Hind 's crew ca n't be asked to do . Even these men , who are our old friends , may refuse to do it  --  " " We will not ! " Old Ambrose jerked his fist up roughly to mark his words . She spoke on without looking away from Captain LeNotre 's impassive face . " I asked them to stay below because the ventureis a matter of cold cash . A lot of it , to my way of thinking . If I do what I hope to do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a good time longer , whether she earns her own way or not . " She faced the dorymen and said : " Go to dinner now . Be sure to praise the cook and gain your welcome . " They climbed the steps and closed the slide behind them . She again spoke to the captain . " I 'll tell you this much more . And "  --  turning to me  --  " I tell you , John , because you 're mate aboard this vessel and have a right to know . I need these men for the job . These  --  and no others . I need that dory and I may need the extra stores . I hope so . The thing I 'm going to pull off , if I can , is a simple one . It 's so simple , in fact , that if anybodyon the Doonan Wharf had seen extra men and dories aboard the Hind  --  well ! they might well figure it out and beat me to it . The same applies to the Doubloon . But not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her confidence . " Now I 'm in the clear . And I 'm still on my own  --  and there 's an end to talk ! " She took a step deeper into the light and there , with one scarred hand against her breast and the other curved in an appeal to him , she put off her harsh look and put on an expression so disarming  --  aye ! and so tender  --  that Ip108d toward the glass . She said : " Now , Paul , I hope that 's right with you . It is , is n't it ? " ow could he help yielding ? No , there was nothing for to do except throw his own mask away , or put on another a kindlier one . He laughed and stretched out his great L to her arm , which he lightly touched . " Anything you goes with me , Nora Doonan . You know that . It must . ' t forget that you 're the owner of the Hind now ! So ? say what you please and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " Is that it , John ? " hat was what I wanted from him . Just the same , the ease is jump from sullen anger to genial acceptance took me k . Really , I myself could hardly have fallen onto the new as readily as he had . It was against common nature . I am : y sure that this was the first time , since I had learned of strange stay aboard the Doubloon , that I felt the burn of Le fear , fear of a man who could do a right-about so kly . And swallow his pride in doing so . By this same c , I should have learned to fear myself ; because I proved as subtle as he . I concealed my thought , grinned amiably said : " Righto ! Her iron word is the iron law ! " ora Doonan was vastly cheered by our words . She said in ht frankness : " Paul , I must confess that 's why I wanted clear of the Doubloon. " e answered carelessly . " Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter there ? " ora replied : " I know Captain Parren is an old friend of rs . And he 's been a good friend to us  --  to my grandfather to me . Now and in times past . But he loves money too h for my taste , even if he is generous once he lays hands t . I hate to say it , Paul , but the truth of it is that I wanted keep clear of the Doubloon so he could n't possibly learnp109about this business of Ambrose and the meaning of the dory . " " Good for you ! " Captain LeNotre stretched his arms idly and looked down into his bunk . He shook off the whole businessby saying in lazy good nature : " The bunk looks good to me , churns . I just ca n't say how glad I am to be away from that wharf . I thought we 'd never make it . " He glanced at the glass , which stood at " Fair , " and said : " I 'll turn in now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the locker near her bunk , stretched out her long legs and said to me : " John , do a tired greenhorn a favor , will you ? " I knelt and pulled off her doryman boots . I hung up her slicker and her oilskin overalls to dry behind the stove and then I turned in . I had taken the drowned Corkery 's bunk . It was a double bunk ; and another doryman lay sound asleep on the inside , thus leaving no room for any poor ghost that might have come aboard in the passage of the night . Halfway into a dream , I heard the watch come down and speak to the captain . " A big fleet on our course . We 'll be in it soon . ' Less they send us home . " I heard the captain say : " Ah , Billy ! " and : " Get around it . Shake that reef out of the mainsail . Steer cast . Call me if you are challenged . " " How long , Captain ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Seal Island . " " All night . East . Seal Island . Yes , Captain . " " Call me if the wind changes . " " Call you if the wind changes . " I heard the watch climb the steps , and I heard the work go forward on the sails . A little later , the Hind lay over to gain her new course . Soon her customary rhythm returned and this gave to us all our exit from troubles and high hopes.  |p110THE  WIND stayed fair for the Golden Hind all the long autumnalnight and all the day . I was on bow-watch when the first frosty gleams shot seaward from the Nova Scotian hills . CaptainLeNotre had the helm . We had left our topsails clewed up and ran handsomely enough under a whole mainsail into the outer harbor of Shelburne , where our business was to be done . We hove to and tarried there for some time , waiting for the Canadian cutter to give us permission and an entry number for our signal halyard . I reported the cutter as lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she apparently had some business with herring-boats . Before she turned toward us , a Nova Scotian schooner , which was also under a whole mainsail , ran through the Shelburne gate , a barrier of buoys and chains that still guarded the inner harbor and the Roseway River . She hailed , but did not speak us , being too far away . The cutter gave us leave and Captain LeNotre let the Hind shoot smartly through the gate , whereupon Nora stepped to the wheel and by her words gave the true beginning to her venture . She said : " If you 'll heave to again , Paul , I 'll rid you of the stranger dory now and my men . " I had expected something of the sort because the stranger dory had been swung off and had been loaded with stores and with bundles wrapped in burlap , which I made out to be toolsp111and sledges ; because the handle of a pair of blacksmith 's tongs had worked its way through the burlap . The captain told me to carry out her order . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Do you stay with us or go in the dory ? " " I 'll stay aboard for the time being , Paul . " He said : " Right you are . " He brought the vessel into the wind . During the night , the five secret recruits had received a part of their orders . These must have been bewildering , yet they kept their mouths shut and went nimbly about the business . And smartly , too . I saw old Ambrose throw a bit of canvas over the tong handles . There was some grinning amongst them , however , and among the Hind 's people , who watched this curious departure with a general **26;711;TOOLONG ? air . The laughter was caused by the comical appearance of tall Ambrose , captain of the five , who was rigged out in his Sunday best , even to a magnificent derby hat that had greened a little in the decades since he had first donned it for a jamboree . In the best of circumstances , a derby is an odd headpiece , especially above a ruddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see a whale with a cape . Ambrose also wore a white shirt  --  and of all the things to strike on !  --  a gates-ajar collar with a black silk necktie in which he ( or Nora ) had stuck a beautiful pearl stickpin . This ornament I recognized as a Doonan heirloom . He had shaved his cheeks and chin to the smarting point and had given his white moustache a dandy 's treatment with a little cooking oil from the galley . All in all , what with his grave air and patient eyes , he certainly looked like a rather prosperous greenhorn , like a vice president of the National Bank . Without a glance at the thronged rail , he took his place in the stern sheets , wrapped his grey ulster neatly around his 2knees , and uttered his loud " Give way ! " The dory , two men to a thwart , steered toward the Roseway 's western shore and , in a few minutes , vanished in a twist of vapor sent down from the valleys by the sun . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much guessing and conjecture , that a queer , strained silence soon passed over the Hind 's deck . There were some glances turned toward Nora , of course . I suppose in the hope that she might now reveal her secret . I said to her : " Well , you 've fooled a lot of people so far . I only hope you do n't fool yourself . " She replied : " It would n't be the first time , John . But if I do miss out on this play  --  it 'll be the end of the Hind . " Since we were not alone , it was plain that she meant others to know that the gravest part of her canny game had begun . Thus they were to understand that she was in no mood for jesting , which was a trick the older men enjoyed with her because they never could quite make up their minds that the child , who had sailed with them so often , had become this long-legged , solemn-eyed girl in boots , who took a hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hint for whatever ears were straining for it , she drew me to the rail to talk while the Hind ambled onward to Shelburne Wharf , where she was to take bait and leave for her fishing . Those words , " the end of the Hind , " had first saddened me , then had made me angry ; for I considered it a foolish thing in her that she should dare to risk her vessel in a lost cause . Why ! even the Canadians , who had clung to their sails as long as they could , had gone so far by this time that they were ready to build draggers for any man who would do the business for them ; and I myself had received a handsome offer from the people at Halifax , who were willing to subsidize thepI I 3venture for the sake of getting more fish for England . I could n't sail under another flag , much as I liked theirs . And here stood Nora Doonan , headstrong as ever , with the knowledgegrowing in her that she must make money on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Hind , or else give over . I admit that she was bound by certain unchangeable conditions , namely , that she could n't borrow money on the Hind or share ownership , but it was plain to me that she actually considered her grandfather 's debts ( to Parren and others ) and her own debts , which were not small , to be obligationswhich the Hind must make good , either with her earningsor with her hull . This was nothing to be laughed at ; or to be put aside lightly . The Hind was worth over a hundred thousand dollars as she lay . Converted into a dragger , she could pay for her changes in a few months and earn a hundred thousand a year thereafter . Nora Doonan might have stretched a moral point or , better still , she might have been strictly honest with herself and try to raise the money that would take the mainsail and the dories off the Hind and put an engine and my nets aboard her . I told her so again while we glided into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take my advice , " I said , " and buy no bait . She 'll lose the cod again and you 'll be in the bucket . Take the train back to Boston and be done with dory trawling . " She made no real answer to my thought . We had quarrelled so many times in our young lives that she could always tell when the glass was falling with me . So she was ready . She said sternly : " The Hind remains the Hind during the life of my grandfather . And , perhaps , during mine . I can not and will not say . " She then took the wind out my sails neatly by asking : " How much is bait here now ? Do you know ? "  | " Four cents . " " And at Yarmouth ? " " Four and a half . " " We did well to come here for it then . " I kept my silence . The price of herring was nothing to get gaffy about . She read me in a sly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the bait 's been in the icehouse ? " " Long enough ! Considering that the Hind 's the only vessel taking bait here in a month o ' Sundays . " " July herring maybe . Grandfather always said they 're the fattest and the best for the Banks . " She looked in a hard way at the herring dealers on the wharf , who were trying to stare at her without her knowing it . " If that 's the case  --  the Hind being the only buyer  --  we ought to beat them down half a cent , do n't you think ? " I laughed so loudly that the gulls jumped . " You crook ! Give the men their wages , will you ? " She laughed at her success over me ; and then watched the baskets of herring swing out from the overturned boxes on the wharf and swing down to the Hind 's hatch . The Lisbon and Billy Atkins were stowing the bait in the pens . Captain LeNotre stood by the hatch , keeping a close eye on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then a plump herring skipped stiffly out of the rattling flow . He 'd pick it up , smile in satisfaction at the fat sides , and throw it down into the pen . Nora said to me : " Go below , John , like a good man , and bring up my suitcase . It 's all ready . I 'm going to the Loyalist Tavern to dress for my part in this business . " She looked down in distaste at her wrinkled trousers and dirty boots . " It 'll be a pleasure to get out of this rig , even for an hour . " pI I 5She was n't the one to complain about a doryman 's rig . Never had before , to my knowledge ; and she 'd been forced to wear it long enough , the Lord knows . Because of this , her words had more than a casual meaning to me . So had the severeness of her mouth , which had whitened a little at the corners . Thus I knew that she had been waiting for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an encounterwhich was now imminent . And I understood , too , that she meant to do some sailing herself , either on the Hind or some other vessel . Else why should she speak so plainly of being out of her sea togs for only an hour ? Well , I kept my mouth shut for once , went down into the cabin and came back with the suitcase , which I carried to the wharf . I saw her go forward and talk to the captain briefly . She spoke of me in such a way that he raised his eyes toward me and nodded briskly . At the same time , I noticed that the Hind 's people were staying aboard the vessel or close to it . This was strange ; because the men rather liked the town . I spoke to a doryman about it and he said that the captain had given orders for all to stand by until the owner sent back word that her business had been done . I had received no such order . Presently I found out why this exception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and came on deck again , this time wearing a topcoat to make her less noticeable on the streets . She led me away from the wharf and there told me what I expected to hear : that I had been chosen to take part in her venture . She gave me to understand that she had kept her pledge , that neither the captain nor the five dorymen on the river knew the meaning of all these preparations . She was on her own , she repeated , and had no intention of sharing blame or credit , if any there should be . Her knowledge of thep116chandler 's trade had led her directly to the venture , she said , and she would take no advice for or against her plan . She had worked it out to the last possible detail . Now , while she spoke , I saw the frown of despair come back to her face ; and this pained me so much that I said : " Come to the point , Miss . What 's my part ? " She answered : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil tongue in your head whether we win or lose . We 're old friends and I do n't intend to let our friendship spoil . See that you keep it in repair . " " Agreed , " I said with not much grace . " Then you 're to go now to Bannister 's stockyard and stand by . Find him  --  if he 's not in Yarmouth  --  and keep him handy . Ask him the price of beef . Good , marbly beef . He 'll not have any . Say that the Hind 's cook sent you . But , above all , pretend that you do n't know me when I come in . " " Bannister ! " This was a harsh turn , in my opinion . Bannisterwas a prime rascal . He had been a small trader in the Labrador , later in Newfoundland , where he was known to Captain Parren and to my father . Father had found him a dishonest dealer and a hard man . Not only with men of the sea , but ' longshore , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drift westward ; and for some years he had been handling cattle and meat on an increasing scale in Shelburneand at Yarmouth , where he had an establishment . I knew that only a few years before , when LeNotre had first taken command , Bannister had cheated Grandfather Doonan out of a large sum , earned by the Hind in a lucky season and carelessly thrown away in a speculation on government contracts . I could never get the right of it , but I remembered that a large herd , or several herds , of Canadian Angus cattle were involved.  |p117I  said : " He 's hard to handle  --  that old wretch . He 's beaten the Hind before . " The look that came into her eyes was something difficult to bear , it being so close to hatred ; and those were eyes in which I had been accustomed to see quite another light . She said in a violent tone : " Bannister is going to be taken today , sure as my name is Doonan ! What I 'm going to do to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst enemy . " " He was that very thing ! " I said quickly . " Yes ! But we were up his alley on that business . This time the deal 's in my line . He can weigh up a steer well enough with his eye , but he does n't know bilge from pudding . " I said : " There 's more truth than poetry in that . " " Go along now , " she said ; and turned away . I watched her trudge off toward the town , and she seemed , somehow , to have become a little girl again . I 'd have given much to free her from her need and from her fear . I dallied by the shore a while , and watched two dorymen cutting willow wands for heaving-sticks ; and then I went up to the town , where I walked slowly down the main street , stopping now and then to pass the time of day with a Nova Scotian skipper or with a patrol of the Irish Regiment , which was then on provost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who used to be a fisherman on the Bluenose , I said : " You boys getting any good beef from Bannister lately ? " The sergeant spat . I strolled down one of the lanes that led to the riverside and turned westward toward Bannister 's stockyard . I heard again the squealing of shoats and the lowing of cattle beyond the stys . When I came up to the gate , I saw Bannister taking the sun on a box in front of the shanty which served him as an office . He was blinking at the sun in a crafty manner ; and , nop118doubt , was thinking how nice it would be if he could buy it up and make a slight but universal charge for its use . Special rate for babies . He had a face like a doryman 's fist . He was expertlyattired , as usual , in patches and broken boots . His right elbow stuck eloquently out of his hand-me-down jacket . The jacket was fastened in front by a rusted horse-blanket pin . You 'd hardly think the poor creature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred thousand dollars . That was precisely the point he labored to make . And did make . Up until the moment I hailed him , Mister Bannister had so far forgotten his role in life that a look of contentment had brightened his face . When he heard my shout , and saw a Gloucesterman , he switched off his inner lights and began to murmur sadly in the Job vein . " Ah , well ! Ah , well ! " And : " Good day , Captain , good day ! Miserable day , ai n't it ? Come to look at an old man in the midst of ruin , eh ? Well , all right ! It 's all right . I do n't mind . " And such gabber , spilt from a mouth that was enough to turn the stomach of a washed man . He rubbed the back of his filthy hand across his eyes , which had at once filled with tears . I said : " Now , now , Bannister ! Do n't take on so . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If things do n't get worse soon , there 's a chance they may get better . " He blew his nose through his fingers and made a sobbing noise . " There 's much in what you say , Captain , I do admit . You 're a sound young man , Captain Bannon , a sound young man , and that 's a thing I 've said time and time again at the God-given opportunity and bless us this day . " This was just about the distance Bannister could go without getting a bargain under way . He said : " And what can a poor old man  --  a very poor one  --  do for ye this day , Captain Bannon ? Some prime quarters of beef , perhaps ? Or fair to mid/dling ? Lean hams ? Canadian bacon which you 're all so fond of , perhaps ? " I let my head fall a little in mock despair , which was n't too difficult for me , considering the circumstances . I flung a hand up in a woeful gesture and said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I make no bones about it . I 'm not to be called captain . ' I 'm a doryman again  --  " " A doryman ! " Disappointment turned his croak into a mean shriek . " A doryman , is it ? May the Lord have mercy on us when His snow falls ! You were skipper of a fine dragger out of Boston when last I laid eyes on ye ! With a big icebox to be filled . " He jumped up to take a nearer , shrewder look . He added up the wear and tear in my clothes . " Drunk yourself back into a dory , eh ? Drunk yourself out of twenty thousand a year , I take it ? " His rage made him dance a bit . The sole of his left boot flapped miserably . " Oh , the world , the world , the drink ! " " ' Tis n't exactly that way , Bannister , " said I. " Talked myselfback into a dory , I did . That 's my story . And now  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his rags to the breeze and hopped frantically up and down . 1Ic had already lost imagined hundreds and was apt to lose more , if this kept on . " There 's too much bloody talk along this coast ! " His eyes had changed into the shape and frost-hue of a dogfish eye . He suddenly gave up in disgust , not being able to hear a jingle in my pocket , no matter how he strained for it . He said roughly : " What do you want , doryman ? Out with it ? " " Well , as I told you , I 've come down in the world , Mister Bannister "  --  I leaned ever so slightly on the new " Mister " because I did n't wish to have him drive me away  --  " and I came in today on the Golden Hind  --  " " The Golden Hind ! The Golden Hind ! " Mister Bannisterp120smoothly licked his lower lip clear across to the starboard , where the tongue moved reluctantly inboard , quite as if the lip had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of air and blinked thoughtfully . " And how is that honorable old gentleman  --  Captain Doonan ? " he asked . " A gentleman of the old Gloucester school  --  he is ! " His geniality changed swiftly to a glitter when he added : " And the Hind 's skipper ? You much aware of him ? " I answered shortly that the old gentleman was still alive and I went on with my story , saying : " A doryman again . On the Golden Hind . And I need a little gear for the fishing . I rememberedyou once had a little stuff that you took for a bad debt . I want an old gaff and a gobstick maybe . And boots , perhaps . And have you any old oil clothing ? We 'll be oiling up on the Banks this time all right , Mister Bannister . And in Gloucester  --  well ! when a man 's down and out in Gloucester , where is he ? I ask you ! " " He 's down and out ! Same as here . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel my face flush . I thrust my hand into my pocket and said : " I can pay a little something . I 'm not looking for charity . " " That 's good , doryman , that 's good ! " Bannister began scratching the bargain point on his bristly chin . " Let me see ! Let me see ! " His eyes darted over his domain : barns , sheds , stys and paddocks , all ranged along the tumbledown yard . The horns of bulls flashed in the sun . I heard the clashing of rams ' horns from the sheepfolds in the lane . In order to freshen my eyes a little , I looked over the Roseway . And they were freshened . Widened ! The stranger dory from the Hind lay there . Even while I watched , a hot speculationbubbling inside me , the port oars gave a stroke or two toward the stockyard . There were only four men in it . Am/brose , in the glory of his ' longshore togs , was not among his chums . I fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puzzle . He did n't have much gear to sell to a doryman , especially to a down-and-outer . He did n't seem to be able to remember the things I had mentioned ; for the good and sufficient reason that he had never shown them to me . Yet he hated to let go of a chance to turn a dollar , even if it was an honest one and could stand the bite of teeth . He began to inch along in a crab gait and beckoned to me . We passed the ice-house and turned toward a wharf , where two livestock barges were tied up . And here , a familiar scene to me , we came to a thing that had always filled me with a sailing-master 's woe . It was a ruin , yet there was grandness in the ruin . The vessel was a schooner-yacht , a fathom longer than the Hind , and yacht-decked ; that is , she had no wooden rail , only the vestige of an iron one . Her skylights , well made of maple wood , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The matched timbers of her deck had resisted snow and frost for many seasons . Everything that could be broken or carried away had gone . IIer stays had vanished . Even the ring-bolts were out . She had taken water , too , and lay heavy in the Roseway tide . Nevertheless , enough of her old buoyancy remained so that she leaned ever so slightly in answer to the tugging of the tide . Out of her hold came a sighing and a rhythmic groaning , as if she wished to say : " Aye ! there could be some sailing yet ! " Nothing  --  not even old Bannister 's ignorance and neglect could kill her beauty and her strength . Her spars , cracked and peeled , lay along the wharf ; and a big-eared mouse played there . The spars , too , gave off a sort of splendor , a hint of gales outworn and glorious races won . She was the Hind 's own sister.  | 2This vessel was none other than the old contender : the never-to-be-forgotten Western Star . Her gallant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least , to those who had lain under crowded sails . Her owner , in a time of ' longshore evil , had killed himself aboard her while she lay gleaming in Shelburne Harbor . The sorrowing people , whom he had left behind him , had let her go with a curse into the first pair of willing hands . Those hands , of course , had been Bannister 's . Long since , she had been forgotten . I halted there and laid a hand on the butt of her mighty mainmast and gave her a tender look for the sake of the days when the Hind had sailed against her . I remembered her with all her hamper spread under a summer moon ; and I remembered her driving before the gale with her decks drowned . Wonderful she was going off the wind , and a gainer thereby . " Come along , doryman ! Come along ! " Bannister scratched himself with his claws and urged me on again . Seeing that I lingered above the near-ruin , he said : " Once ye thought you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ai n't in such funds now , be ye ? " This delicate touch brought no word from me . He murmured : " ' Tis n't a purchase for a poor doryman . No ! Tho ' cheap she is . Cheap . " I shook my head sadly . I stepped onto the stringpiece and looked through the torn skylights and down into her wrecked , rusted bathrooms , her bursted lockers and cabins filled with murmurs . And with my mind 's eye I looked down and down to the great and famous keel that rested ingloriously on the Roseway mud . In the midst of my unhappy remembrance , a terrifying thought shot through me . ' T was like sudden thunderin the night . I clapped my hand over my mouth to shut off the word that came bursting up.  |p123Bannister  capered and drew close . " Do n't take on so , laddie . God send the day when ye may take her ! Ye raced against her more than once when you were a boy , eh ? Aye ! I remember , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A fine , strappingwoman  --  " His mouth began to lather up . This was the moment when , arm-in-arm through the gate , there came a portly , handsome man , well-wrapped in a grey ulster , left open to show a beautiful pearl in his necktie . Clinging to his arm , there was a tall young woman in a green suit of woollen stuff , which suited her well . She wore a green felt hat that seemed rather mannish to me ; and over her face a wisp of black veil , lightly marked with green dots . The veil was something new to my eyes , but it seemed quite fashionableand fetching . The man looked very much like a vice president of a National Bank . He carried himself stiffly , yet with an easy dignity that spelled worldly success and an inner integrity . His voice boomed beautifully and I clearly heard the words : " Think nothing of it , my dear ! Sentiment ! Senti-ment ! " I knocked Bannister with my elbow and whispered : " Well , is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to crow . " Ai n't seen a finer pair of legs since Widow Dumbra skipped jail ! " He tried again and , this time , he really crowed in celebration of times past . " Limbs ! " I said , " limbs , if you please . " " Limbs ? " " That 's what we say in Boston , where she comes from . Unless I miss my guess . Limbs . Not legs . " " Well , Captain Bannon , " replied Bannister with witty good sense , " we ai n't in Boston now nor anywheres near it . So legs they is and legs they will remain and a finer set I have n't laidp124eyes on since Belle Jorkan got knifed ! " What other memory shook him suddenly ? He groaned and held a hand against his mouth . He found reason to stare at the littered earth . He pulled up at once and said : " What in the name of porridge do you figure such a lot is doing on my old tumbledown ? " I had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except to keep him on his course . I replied : " You 've got me , Mister Bannister . Although , to tell the truth , that old gentleman has a familiar look , has n't he ? " Without waiting for an answer , I said : " Do n't mind me . Take care of them . Maybe he 's a contractor for army beef . " " Could be . Could be . " Bannister trembled with the force of revived hopes . " Must be . Must be . I 've seen that face somewherelong ago . " I whispered : " Might be in a newspaper somewhere . Looks like important money to me , Mister Bannister . " He squeezed up his eyes to concentrate their fire . The man in the wonderful derby patted the lady 's cheek in a fatherly manner . His gloves seemed to cause some difficulty , which he laughed off gently and said : " No , my dear , no ! Sentiment ! Sentiment ! " Bannister hissed between his charred lips . He closed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've seen him in a picture somewhere . " That picture , could he but form it , had been the business end of bait tackle on Shelburne Wharf . His memory could n't do away with the stiff collar and the pearl , not to mention brilliant gloves . " Sentiment ! Sentiment ! " Thus the newcomers drew up . The gentleman said to Bannister : " My good fellow ! a dollar for you . Go find Mister Bannister and tell him I am here . There now . Hurry along ! No delay . No tarrying , if you understand what I mean . "  |p125This  beginning was really better than I foresaw ; because the speech was delivered in an excellent imitation of the bad imitation which some Bostonians use for English . " Bannister " became " Bahnister . " The bubble and flow of words was extremelyagreeable and surprising , although I had known there was a gift of the gab there . It was the richness of the gift that pleased me , especially because I perceived that both the gentlemanand the lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strain in his old eyes ; and , in her , I saw a stiffened , whitened mouth again . Mister Bannister raised two of his pretty fingers to the brim of his hat and tugged courteously . This won him such a smile from the veiled eyes that he began to quiver . He was , as they say , rendered helpless . He managed this much : " Wot ? " In order to relieve the actors of any doubt concerning my own cues , I gave my cap a tug and said in a respectful tone : " This here person is poor Mister Bannister. himself . " The gentleman raised the port brow . He also raised his hand , from which an American dollar blew . With just the proper air of distaste that Mister Bannister loved to create in others , the gentleman released the bill . " Ah , you are Bannister ? You may have the dollar just the same . " IIc cleared his throat and said in a louder tone : " Sentiment ! Sentiment , my dear Bannister . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor man . Do ! " Mister Bannister clawed up the bill in a gullish swoop and went south with it . Into his rags . " Wot ? " said he , half paralyzedby this first success . " Wot 's wanted , gentleman ? " " A mere nothing , my good man . A mere matter of an old man 's sentiment . A family matter , Mister Bannister . " A forward movement by the lady halted his spout of words . He escorted her to the stringpiece , where he gave Bannister ap126warning glance against interference . There , at last , she looked down upon the ruin of the Western Star . In that first , trying moment , she did not lift her head . Wrapped in melancholy , bowed by it , she gazed at the scarred , glass-scattered deck . A moan escaped her tinted lips ; then , whispering some passionate phrases to herself , she crossed her elegant arms and gazed into the past . I took Mister Bannister by the arm and drew him back a step . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch yourself ! Here 's a pair of the right sort . Part of the old owner 's family , unless I miss my guess . They 're going to buy her ! " I tightened my grasp and peered into the warming eyes . " Grab it ! The first offer . Sign them up , right here and now . I know this crowd . " I tapped my forehead lightly and leered . " For me  --  ten per cent ! " " Five ! " whispered Bannister . " Five 's the best I can do . " " Eight ! " I said . " Must have eight . Down and out , you know . " " Split the difference , " said Bannister . " That 's six and a half . " " Done ! " Bannister advanced . His hands crept together to hide their trembling . Avarice dripped from his mouth like grease from a hot goose . He clutched at his hat again and , faint with longing , questioned the gentleman : " Wot ? Wot 's wanted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his ulster pocket and , handing it to me in the grand manner , said : " My boy , take what your employer requires . I make no bones about it , as the vulgar say . It is my intention to purchase the Western Star , Mister Bannister . To purchase her , sir , here and now . " He drew himself up an inch more and said in a tone ofp127profound sadness : " It 's a matter of sentiment , my dear sir . Family sentiment that can be of no concern to you . " I opened the wallet and worked up a bill until the " too " on its face appeared . Mister Bannister gazed in rapture . He took a taste of it with his eyes , swallowed the taste , and , without lifting his gaze , asked : " What was you thinking of paying for her , gentleman ? " The gentleman gave a main-boom sweep of his arm . " Mister Bannister , money is no object ! None , sir ! We  --  that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little sentimentalities , sir . " He gave the lady an affectionate glance and took her hand . " It is my intention  --  yes ! my child , yes !  --  to have this lovely ruin  --  for such it is , sir  --  to have her pulled far beyond the surrounding and bordering lands , far to the bounding main , sir , where once she lived and conquered in her glory . And there , Mister Bannister , there , where only the gulls may see and mourn for her departed splendor  --  there she shall burn ! " He swept his gleaming gloves high over Bannister 's upturned face . " Burn ! Burn ! " " Burn ? Burn ? " Mister Bannister jerked his glance back toward the magic bill . I gave him a fast , sly wink , extended my hand over the bill and held the fingers out , which meant : " The price is five hundred . " The old gentleman struck hard at his chest and bellowed . " I said burn ! ' , sir , and burn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flame ! Long has it waved on high ! Burn , Mister Bannister ! So that her ashes , sacred to the altars of memory , may settle in peace upon the billows that she loved and ruled in the glory and strength of her youth . " He touched his eye gently and coughed behind the glove to hide his undeniable tears.  | In my opinion , this was going a little too far . My natural fear of oratory increased my anxiety . However . the money had worked its magic on Bannister . He was almost in a frenzy . His claws twitched . The young lady apparently had a feeling similar to mine concerning the dangers of eloquence . I saw her fingers close in warning on the arm that embraced her . She whispered : " No , uncle ! Let the Western Star go as she went long ago in happier days . Let her go down this river , pushed by her own lovely sail , and go into the ocean and there , uncle , let her  --  let her be  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suggested . " Thank you , sir , " she said in a prim fashion . Bannister could stand it no longer . He said briskly : " Five hundred dollars ! " " Sufficient unto the day is the work thereof ! " cried the gentleman . " If , Mister Bannister , you say five hundred  --  five hundred it shall be . A costly whim , no doubt . Costly . But count it out , young man , count it out for your worthy em-ployer . " " Five hundred , " I repeated . " American dollars , Mister Ban-nister ? " Bannister 's heart , which he had never heard from before , almost broke . Oddly enough , he giggled . No doubt , he believedI was insane to bring up the matter of exchange . He said hastily : " American , of course . The gentleman means American dollars , I 'm sure . " The gentleman nodded and said : " For this  --  this honorarium , Mister Bannister , let it be our understanding  --  correct me if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assist us in our sentimental plans . If not  --  " He looked aloft . I winked hard at Bannister.  | " Yes ! " he shouted . " Sentiment is strong amongst us , Mister Bannister . Nevertheless  --  well ! you will surely assist us to the extent of a pump to remove the water that by now must have seeped into her cellar ? " " Yes ! " shouted Bannister . He held out a begging hand to me . I was thumbing over the bills rather clumsily . I drew away . " And the use of any materials that may be necessary ? Such as nails , tacks , strings , and  --  ah , yes !  --  sailing cloth ? That is , what you men of the sea call  --  " " Canvas ! " I said . I bowed my head over the bills to hide my eyes . " Spars and sails are there . Such as they are , you have them ! " Bannister bustled up to me and whispered : " Now then ! Now then , doryman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this venture ? " asked the lady . " Have you some workmen , Mister Bannister , who might assist those we may find ? " " Three at five dollars a day , ma'am . " " Ah ! you are kind ! Kind , Mister Bannister . " She glanced at him through the veil and then , in girlish confusion , whispered to the old gentleman , who , turning to me , asked : " Young man , can you write ? " " Can I what ? " I shouted . She gave me a frown and I fell back , having remembered in time that neither Bannister nor old Ambrose could do much more than scrawl their names . " A plain question , Captain ! " shouted Bannister in pitiful anxiety lest one or another of the madmen cheat him at the last moment . " Say yes , sir ' and that 's all there is to it . Oh , the good Lord have mercy on us when His cold winds blow ! " By this time , a great deal of sweat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chin was quite filled up with the foam of desire . He was , in fact , more than half-mad himself . Before he could speak again , I had begun to write the bargain out on a sheet of paper . All present signed it and witnessed it . I thrust the paper into the old gentleman 's wallet before Bannister could try to make out the names , if he had the wit ; and I explained that the document and the ship 's papers must be shown at once to the customs and various others , including the military . The gentleman and lady bowed and walked away . Bannister again stretched out his yearning hands . I slowly counted the five hundred , bill by bill , and laid them on the hands . " Now , " I said , " my commission , Mister Bannister . For a poor doryman , if you please . " Bannister stuffed the bills into his pocket . After he had them all stowed away , he began pulling them out again , one by one , until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while , then gave it to me . He added a dollar and a fifty-cent piece from another pocket , saying : " Six and half , you said . And there 's my own commission on your part of the deal . But I 'll forgive ye that , I 'll forgive ye that , poor doryman . " " Thank you , " I said . " That 's generous of you . Now I wo n't be needing your old gobstick or your oil clothing , Mister Bannister . I 'll buy me new gear . So I will . " I then pointed to the stranger dory . It was coming directly toward the Western Star . I said : " The new owners waste no time , Bannister . A businessman all right , I guess . In a hurry to get back to Boston , I suppose . " " Businessman ! Business ! Ha ! Ha ! " Bannister rapped his knuckles against the roll of bills under his patches . " Call it business if you like , Captain . I call it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for which I paid nothing !  |p13Inothing  !  --  for five hundred dollars to a set of madmen . They 're as and as the owner was . They 're kin all right ! And he shot himself . He did ! I heard the bang myself as I come aboard with beef that day . " The four old dorymen pulled up to the yacht . They threw hammers and sledges aboard and flung off their jackets . They began to clear the deck of fragments of glass and junk . I heard Peter Lord sing out cheerfully : " Sure , she 'll make do ! She 's buoyant yet . " Bannister said : " Had their men ready all right . Pretty sure of himself , old codger was . " I now perceived that , quite slowly , the cattle dealer was beginning to understand that there might be a fine pig in the poke . He asked : " Where 's that dory from , Captain Bannon ? " " Lord only knows ! From a shipyard maybe ? " " Must be ! Must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his talcs of poor profits and ruin . The day was nearly over . I did n't know what might happen next , although I was sure that Nora Doonan and the dorymen were bound to put in an appearance . Once or twice , old Bannister walked over toward the Western Star and watched the dorymen at work there . They gave him neither word nor look . He had returned from such a visit , and was again settling at my side , when I heard him exclaim in surprise . The Golden Hind had sailed into the river . She was under headsails and was steering toward the yard . She towed six dories , all loaded with gear and stores . Such vessels rarely came so far up the Roseway , there being no business for them beyond the herring-house . Her passage caused considerable interest along the shores . I could see men turn from their work , where the herring-nets were stretched to dry . The eveninglight was glittering beyond her and I could n't make outp132who was on her deck . As she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloves . Bannister could n't see far . He kept squinting under his hand . He spoke against the vessel , as if she had no right to come near his place . Of course , he could n't tell who she was . Not for a while . At last , he cried out that the vessel was a schooner ; and , a minute later , he said : " I 'll take my Bible oath that she 's a Gloucesterman . " " She is , Bannister , " I replied . " There 's no doubt in the world about that particular statement . " " And who may she be , laddie ? " " She 's the Golden Hind of Gloucester . ' T is my own vessel , Bannister . " " And why in the name of porridge is she coming to my tumbledown ? " " Bannister , " says I , " have a taste of wait-and-see pudding . " I was considerably upset by his next words and a change ( not for the worse ) in his manner ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his manhood and humanity together , despite the drawbacks of living ashore and trading , and will show his mettle under the right circumstances . He had little concern for the Golden Hind when she lay downstream , out of his ken . Now her actual appearance , which was unexpected , excited some concern in him . I did n't know its source for a long time to come , but I never miss a trick of the sort , especially when so full of stir as I had been since the voyage began . I knew that Bannister had great knowledge of ' longshore men and towns ; and that he was a deposit of evil knowledge and evil tricks . Just the same , there is iron strength in doing evil . It takes a strong heart . It does n't make a man a weakling , by any means , if he cheats and lies his way through life . ( Nora Doonan knew this to be true . That 's why she 3coddled him , instead of doing business in her open and usual way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his peculiar knowledge . He asked : " Does that LeNotre still go skipper of her ? " He seemed to have forgotten his earlier remark about our captain . I said it was so . I looked at him , while he peered at the schooner . I saw his teeth press down on his lower lip . Two distinct expressions followed on his face : first , a look of alarm , and then one of open anger , which , in turn , was bolstered by a dainty piece of cursework . I spoke again easily . " While I 'm not able to say exactly what she 's doing here , Bannister , I can tell you that you 've nothing to fear from the Hind . Bygones are bygones . Especially today . " " ' Tis n't the Hind I fear , laddie . " I could make no reply . He then said in as firm a tone I ever heard from him : " I fear nothing . " Now , of the actions and words which upset me , those were the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonishing . Back there a space , I put down the true fact that Bannister'seyes had filled with tears when he played Job to me . ' T was nothing , merely the art of business , such as are the tears of a woman of the streets . I 'm not praising my own sharpness when I say that I can tell the difference . What captain worth his salt ca n't do it ? He sees a variety of both in daily course . Well , a tear or t  --  70 seeped out of Bannister 's eye while he gazed at the men on the schooner 's deck . He struck at his eyes . That 's all . Even then ( without hindsight to aid me ) I knew he was hearing from his heart again . All the dories were dropped . The first one that came overp134to the Western Star was manned by old Ambrose and the Lisbon . Ambrose had changed into his working clothes . He still wore the handsome yellow gloves . He waved one hand amiably to Bannister and then turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anvil to the Western Star 's deck . This was the Lisbon 's gear . There was n't a bolt or a shackle on the Hind that he could n't forge himself , if need be . Bannister cried out : " Is n't that  --  say ! Captain , ai n't he pretty seamanlike all of a sudden  --  that old gentleman ? " I gave him no answer . Bad as he was , there was no gainsayingthat he was a human being ; and I had no wish to add to the woe he was about to suffer , though well he deserved it . And now I come to think of it , he was much the gainer ; for in his black ignorance he surely would have let the Western Star perish in the slime . The second dory came alongside . Captain LeNotre and Nora were in it . It was full of stores . Nora , too , had put on her doryman togs again , but there was no mistaking her for a hand . She stood to one side while the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canvas and kegs of nails . She waved her hand to me . She made no sign to Bannister . I said to him : " Yes , that 's the Golden Hind ; and the girl in trousers is the granddaughter of an old friend of yours , CaptainDoonan . She 's the owner of the Hind now . Did you know that , Bannister ? " The wind whistled in his pipe . Now it came Captain LeNotre 's turn . I heard Nora speak rather loudly to him , apparently in countermand of some notion of his . He strode across the deck of the Western Star and vaulted to the wharf . Right away , Billy Atkins followed him . I do n't know what instinct moved me ; however , I jumped to my feet . I had about the time of twenty steps to size thep135captain up ; and I saw that he had the same black dog on his back . Was n't this a strange thing ? Surely , he had learned that something good had happened to the Hind . Yet he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new and a coarse twist in his face when he set eyes on Bannister . I could n't tell whether he was trying to hide his contempt for a cheater cheated , or whether there was another emotion disguised there . He called out : " Bannister ! " Bannister had n't stirred . He sat there , hunched in the cold twilight , and made a most miserable sight , indeed . Yet I was amazed to see him return the captain 's stare with interest added , the interest being an unmistakable scorn . Even his voice had changed when he opened his mouth , at last . I swear it had a fathom or two in it . He said : " I 'll have no truck with you , Captain LeNotre . " The captain appeared not to have heard . He said in a sneer : " You 've done a fine stroke of business here today , you son of-a-whore ! " You can easily tell how far I had gone on a certain course when I say that this dirty Grand Banks epithet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and I do n't like to set it down , but it was the word used and there 's no denying it or withholding it . Just imagine such a word passed from a man who was even heftier than I to a little old squeegee of a thing like Bannister . I stepped out of my character and said quite calmly : " Keep a civil tongue in your head , Captain . There 's no call for abuse that I know of . " The captain at once switched his sneer from Bannister to me and said : " So you 're the broth of a boy who kept the mighty secret all this time ? " Fine words to a doryman ! In the presence of a greenhorn ! Nevertheless , I took them peacefully ; because I was a dory/man and I meant to be a good one . I said : " I know nothing of this business , Captain . Nothing ! I do n't know the mighty secret yet , for that matter . I give you my word . " Old Bannister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having reached his works . He said some words in broad Newfoundlandthat I could n't clearly understand . It was something like : " Na fash ' isself abaht ' un . " I took it to mean that I was n't to concern myself with his affairs . He then gave a whole and seizing look to the captain and to Billy Atkins , who stood a step behind LeNotre . Bannister said : " I 've no wish to talk to you , Captain LeNotre . Nor to your chum there . Now nor never . " Captain LeNotre paid no heed . He said : " You would n't be thinking of giving back the Hind any of that money you stole from us , would you ? Seasons ago ? " Bannister replied : " A speculation 's a speculation . You lost the Noonan money fair and I lost mine fair . But I 've no wish to hold talk with the likes of you . " " Bannister  --  a dirty liar ! " The captain put on such a look of hatred that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lifts a hand against the old one , I 'll beat his brains out . " At this time , I took note of this fact : that certain of the Hind 's people had found their way to the quarter deck of the Western Star and stood near us with upturned faces . I can not tell why , yet it 's true that this encounter between the captain and Bannister found a place in my memory alongside a story of the kind too far back to be well remembered . Perhapsit was a story of the old Greek seamen told to me by my grandfather . Bannister took the new word calmly . I should not have been surprised if he had stepped back in fear ; for Captain LeNotre had become wilder with each passing moment . He had pushed 7his cap back . His hair blew over his face . He struck it back savagely and let his hands play too freely . I heard Billy Atkins speak . He said : " Always was a liar ! " This I took as a sample of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a step  --  half a one  --  forward . He ran his tongue up and down his lip rapidly ; and this gave him a queer sort of calculating look , as if he was actually judging his chances if he struck one of them with his little hands . I began to hope that he would not ; because I knew that all would be over then between the captain and me ; and I had taken my oath that I would see the voyage of the Hind through to the end for the reasons I have recounted . The captain said : " Anyway , Bannister , you 've sold the Western Star ? That 's so , is n't it ? " Bannister nodded . " You know now that you sold her to Nora Doonan ? " " I do . " Bannister had come under the torment . I saw him bring his hands together . However , he trembled so greatly that he could n't hide it . " Nothing held back ? " " Nothing ! " " Keel and all ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Keel ! " Bannister , despite his ignorance of our profession , knew that something monstrous was coming his way . He shouted : " Yes ! Keel and all . Spars and sails . What 's it to you , sir ? What you staring at ? " LeNotre 's scorn blew his nostrils wide . He said : " I just wanted you to know that the keel 's been sold to a party in Boston for sixteen thousand dollars ! To be melted down for the Navy Yard . "  |p138Mister  Bannister had clasped his hands behind him . He held tight and began to sway . The image of the lost dollars seemed to be more than he could stand up under . He had stripped his tumbledown of every nail for the war yards , and the Western Star of every ring-bolt ; yet the immense treasure of lead had lain there unbeknownst to him . All I have to say is that , in the end , he took it like a man . He managed to twist his head toward me and say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd have never let her have the hulk if I 'd known . " He then hit another nail on the head : " Let her get her buy to Gloucester . ' Twill cost lives , I think . " I heard a chorus of " Aye ! " and " Ah ! " below me . And these were sad cries . I echoed them in my heart , which was seawise . Not for those dorymen of the Hind . No ! ' T was for the old , old men , who had been pledged to the hard sailing . I said to myself in sorrow : " Now , Ambrose Cameron , see what you must do for coffee , cakes and a pad ! " And in the silence that now lay over us , I glanced into the tangle on the Western Star 's deck ; and I saw his hands fly up in their grasp of a great sledge . Mister Bannister had not done . He had turned his head away from me and had taken up his quarrel with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't succeeded in doing so . If there had been a victory , it was n't theirs . If they had found satisfaction , he now took a measure to destroy it . He shuffled nearer to them and gave them a chance to look into his eyes . What signal burned in them for that time , I can not say ; because I now stood a stride behind him . Yet I could tell well enough that he held sway over them . Neither the captain nor Billy Atkins had the will to utter a word or take a step . In the dusk and cold , Bannister gazed without flinching . He then spoke his piercing word . It was this : " Murderer ! "  |p139He  shuffled away into the long shadows of his tumbledown . A torch blew into flame on the deck of the Western Star . I heard a sledge strike heavily and I heard Ambrose Cameron shout : " That does it ! Easy now . " The torchlight showed me the faces of those two men standing there ; and a rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lead into their deeps . Both pairs of eyes glowed an instant and went dark . I perceived the quality of fear in them ; and , for a reason that I never could understand , their fear created in me an anger against them . This anger I was careful to divide , keeping one part ( the captain 's ) for another time , and giving Billy Atkins his part by saying an extraordinary thing : " Now , bootlicker , you 've got some news for old Parren . He 'll be gladder to hear it than you are , I hope . " It was n't Billy who answered me . It was the captain . And he did n't really answer ; that is , he did n't look straight at me . He simply repeated the name : " Parren ! " Whether he shudderedor not , I ca n't tell . But his voice shook ; and , even in the faint flashes of light , I saw on his handsome face the same expression which had marked his secret departure from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paces into the welcome dark . I dropped down to the deck of the Western Star . The spectators moved slowly and made way for me in silence . I went forward and saw Nora Doonan take an electric cable from a stranger on the wharf . She passed the end along . I lent a hand and she said : " Old Bannister  --  what 's he been saying to the captain ? " " Why ! " I replied , " he was saying something about drowned Corkery . We 'll never hear the end of that . " I was wrong there.  |p140BY  MIDNIGHT , there were two pumps ( the Hind 's own and Bannister 's ) taking water out of the Western Star ; and it seemed to me , from the quality of the bilge , that most of it was rain which had poured through her skylights and hatches . Good news that ; because it gave us sound reason to hope that the hull itself stayed sound ; which was a reasonable hope , the Western Star being the work of the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midnight and slept aboard the Golden Hind . In the morning , every man turned to on the Western Star . By that time , she had risen high out of her sluggishness and even began to put a strain on her lines , as if she were eager to take the tide that served her . According to his word , Bannister sent down three good workmen , although he himself kept away . Nora Doonan found two shipwrights , who had been making dories on speculation . They were fine craftsmen . More than that , five men of the Irish Regiment , who were on furlough , joined us for the pleasure of employing their old skills , there being no money left to pay them . These additions gave us a crew of thirty-five able men ; so the work of setting up some sort of jury-rig on the yacht went forward far faster than we had hoped . Better still , most of the work , including the stepping of the masts ( without topmasts ) , was to be done under our own eyes ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LeNotre came down fromp141the customs with word that the port had been closed by the military . This was to last five days , at least . Something had happened at sea which required such action . It was a point on which we were told nothing , although there was the usual plenty of guesswork . This delay in the fishing was irksome , yet there was no help for it . For a time , there was some concernamongst us for the pens of bait because the first day of work was warmish . It was feared that the bait might go soft . That afternoon , however , the wind hauled to the eastward and the night 's work was done in freezing weather . This left our minds at ease on that score . I had other reasons for my cheerfulness . The best of them was my old belief that only good things will follow a course laid out according to a man 's conscience . And by that I mean good things for all men of good conscience who are part of his life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mine . I speak of Ambrose Cameron . I had many images of this man in my memory . When I was a child , I had seen him steer a schooner , heavy with ice and woe , up to Ben Pine 's wharf ; and I had watched my father unlash him from a wheel to which he had clung alone for three days and nights because of the winter gale and a strange influenza that had laid low every man aboard that vessel . In strength of heart and limbs , that man had never been surpassed . Lven the hero , Howard Blackburn , had said to me : " What I have done is nothing to that man 's labor . " In later years , I had seen him as the top high-liner of our Gloucester captains ; which is to say that he always found the most cod , caught them quickly , and drove home to a lively market . And you yourself have seen him , standing idle in a Gloucester lane , on the eve of our voyage . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noon of the fifth day of terrible labor on the Western Star , I came upon him in the after cabin of that vessel , which had been cleaned and roughly fitted out . I saw at once that a change had come over him . Outwardly , he was the same : close-cropped silver hair , and grey , spiky moustache ; and his thousand seams and wrinkles and the juts of bronzed cheeks and chin that showed the indomitable Yankee heart within . He sat erect , his back against the bunk . By his side lay a pocket compass . In his hands he held a chart on which a course had been laid out . I have said that he and his chums stood to me as a symbol of the Atlantic brotherhood , which maintains boldly a Constitution of one word : Freedom . On this day he became something more : he became the thinker , the symbol of our human genius that calmly drives a hundred tons of wood and sail into an array of elements which has conquered twenty thousand tons of steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heart went out to him strongly as before ; for I knew the wonders of the sea to which he bent his mind . And I knew more ! I knew that an old mantle ( one he had worn with honor before ) had fallen again on his massive shoulders . Had I not been in the presence of a venerable man , I should have laughed aloud with joy . ( To the indictment of hero-worship , I now plead guilty in the first degree , and throw myself on the mercy of the court . ) I said : " Captain Cameron ! " I gave him the title which I had first spoken to him long ago . He raised his eyes away from the history of shoals and deeps , of tides and buoys and lights . He gave me , as my quick reward , a blue gleam out of the inner eye and said gently : " Yes , young John . I am a captain again . I am on my own vessel . I am reading her charts . "  |p143I  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which were eaten by rust . Nora Noonan had made him captain . In her wisdom , she had found many reasons to do so . First , the law required such an appointment . Second , she took this step in order to break down , if she could , the barrier of which I have spoken . And she became more than ever aware of this barrier because of an inroad she had made on this old man 's heart . Faithful to her as that heart had been ( even to the laying down of its life ) , it had been hampered by tradition , by another faithfulness ; and that to the forecastle . The change had a most profound meaning to us all . It had taken place that very morning when she had called him from his splicing and had said : " You are captain of the Western Star . " The graveness of near departure had brought these two closer together . Knowing that he was deep in friendly thought of her welfare and of the salvation of the Hind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak of the Hind and her people . It had n't escaped her notice that the dorymen had not restored Captain LeNotre to his old and lawful place . Ambrosehad been aboard the Hind long enough to have learned much , especially because he had long since won the respect of all Gloucestermen . She , therefore , raised him from the ranks and stood alone before him in the cabin . He forestalled her opening words by saying : " One thing you must promise me , Miss Nora . Even if it goes against the grain . As well it might , tho ' I do n't know all your plans yet . " She said : " I promise it , Captain Cameron . " " Beforehand ? " " Aye ! Beforehand . " " Why so ? ' T is not your way of doing things . "  | " Because of your wisdom , Captain , and your old friendship for us . " He then said : " I wish to say that you should leave the Western Star to me and my chums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go with her to the Banks . " " I can not ! " " Why not ? " She gave him the answer that he must have expected : " I ca n't ask a man to do anything I will not do myself . No ! " " You are not doing so ! " he replied . " We know you would come with us . That point is settled . There 's another reason why you should do what I say . " With no other preliminary , he then launched into the very subject that she had meant to bring up . He startled her by repeating her own thought : " I 've been aboard the Hind long enough to know that something 's wrong . You must stay aboard to do your duty as her owner . It may not seem the proper thing to do . You 'd rather sail on the Star and take the chance that we must take . But sailing on the Hind is the necessary thing . It 's your duty . " She made no answer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , they talked . Not as much as they would have talked if I had been signed on regular . I mean , for fishing . " He hesitated again . She knew that he was trying to draw a line between the things he could say and the things that customand ancient habit must keep hidden . To help him , she asked : " How much of what you heard can you repeat , Cap-tain ? " He said : " I 'll give you my knowledge , strange as it will seem to you . And apt , I know , to leave your mind uneasy . But that ca n't be helped . Not all I know was learned in the forecastle . Part of it comes from the Gloucester Times . This is it : the Lark came into Boston the day before the Hindp145returned , and sold one hundred thousand pounds . Sold the vessel right through at eighteen cents . She went far for them , I hear . Now , the Thebaud stocked eighty thousand pounds . She came into Boston the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fished the same banks . Yet the Hind had brought nothing much home to you . Please to bear that in mind , Miss Nora . " " I will . " He went on : " A story was told in Gloucester of the death of James Corkery . Captain LeNotre gave you an account of the same thing himself . " " Yes , Captain . And what of this ? " " The two accounts do not agree . " Certainly this declaration stirred her deeply . Just the same , she took it evenly and asked : " How do you know that ? CaptainBannon and I were the only ones that heard the captain 's story . " He replied : " Young John told the captain 's story to me that night . I found him looking for poor Corkery because he feared he might do harm to himself in his grief and madness . " She asked : " Who gave you the crew 's account ? " " It was told to me at the Anchor House by the man who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly : " At fault , according to your captain . Not at fault , according to himself . " Nora cried out at this because it seemed a folly to her . " Why does the Lisbon keep this from mc ? If he thinks that Captain LeNotre is at fault ? That there 's something wrong aboard my schooner ? " In surprise , he answered her . " You are a child with men , Miss Nora ! Do n't you know that no doryman could ever speak to you on such a matter , even if he was sure that Captain LeNotre was led astray ? That he has a black reason for not wanting to kill fish for you ? " This was the hardest blow a man could strike . Ambrose knew it ; and it speaks well for his courage and his love that he could get the words out of his mouth , which was not used to evil stories . She repeated in dismay and disbelief the phrases that struck against her mind and heart and hopes : " Led astray ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " He offered no explanation , despite the sorrow that marked her face again . And , knowing how careful he was in shipboardmatters , she kept her lips pressed tightly together to keep back the other words in her heart , where old , halfformedconjectures were taking clearer shape after long suppressionby her devotion to Captain LeNotre . Captain Cameron then said : " Miss Nora , I can say little of what was told to me in your forecastle . ' T would be dishonest in me . But I can say what was said to me ashore , now that I am your captain . And if shipboard talk pushes me on  --  why ! I ca n't help it ! " She appealed to him . " For Heaven 's sake , Ambrose , speak ! " He said : " The Hind 's people know that Dan Corkerywho'son the Doubloon now  --  and his poor , lost brother were hated  --  aye ! hated and feared !  --  by Captain Parren and Atkins  --  " She cried out again at this mention of the Doubloon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revelation . " Yes ! And more than that ! I 'm sorry to say it , Miss Nora , but they were hated and feared by Captain LeNotre , too . There 's no doubt about it in the minds of your people . " " But why ? Why ? " " That I can not tell you . I do n't know . But there 's one manp147who does know . He has the true story of James Corkery 's death . He knows that he is also hated and feared . And that man loves you like his own daughter . " " Who is that man , Ambrose ? " " The Lisbon . " He would speak no more . As soon as chance offered , Nora Doonan gave me the gist of the matter . This set me to wondering in a deeper way ; because here was a thing against all nature : that a captain should not kill fish when he found them . And it was even more mystifying that he should run the peril of telling falsehoodsconcerning his men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hind was anything except luck . I made her repeat Ambrose 's able comparison of the Hind 's last stock to the rich stock of another vessel , taken at the same time and in the same waters . I had known of the other trips . Yet I had n't taken such thought of them ; and for that failure I 've no excuse , except the same old one : that I was thinking of my nets and working on them . When she told me the story , in the early morning while I rowed her dory from the Hind to the I Vestern Star , all my lively speculation ceased and my own hopes lay quiet because my pity for Nora grew greatly . A strange , sweet pity , making up in my heart because I saw that the old man 's words had laid waste her heart , or were beginning to do so . Tide and wind beat against the dory so that her dark head and its spraywetcoils lifted against the rim of our sea-world ; or sank into the blue . Into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in triumph one season , sadness the next . This was the sea : giving with one hand , taking away with the other . A hope she had of rest from toil and fear . No doubt of that coming true , once the Western Star had made her voyage . And yet her greater hope , by which she had bound her future to the future of a man  --  had it not now come to grief ? Since this was unbearable to me , who wished only for her happiness , ' t is plain enough what the quality of her torment must be . There was little of the bell in her voice that morning . I said : " I do n't believe it . " She made no reply and I thought my words had been knocked down in the slap of water and the shouts and hammerstrokes blowing off the Western Star . I rowed hard to swing the dory into it and I said louder : " I do n't believe it , Nora . There 's a false reckoning in this somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the green rollers bursting beyond the gate and she searched me by a heavy glance in which the green at first was fixed and shot with fire ; then went dark , because she had found the kindly falsehood in my own eyes ; for I could n't help but think of her captain on the Doubloon . A strange skill she showed . I had never lied to her before . She asked : " What shall I do , John ? " and , since it was n't her way to seek another 's counsel in such matters , she gave her own answer without waiting on mine . " The Lisbon must answer . He has the answer . " " Then , " said I , " when we come alongside , call him and we 'll take him to the Hind and get the answer out of him . " This we did . Another man stepped to the forge ; and Terrio , without a glance backward , let himself down into the bow of her dory . Captain LeNotre had been watching the splicing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made him turn . He took a step forward , seeming ready to speak . He thought better of it and gave only a moody glance to our parting . I had time for one long look at the Lisbon before he settled down behind my thwart . He was a man of more than middle age . In ourp149fashion , he was called " the Lisbon " because he 'd been born in Portugal and had come to the Grand Banks with the Portuguesefleet in his boyhood . He had never ceased to fish , had never stopped talking and thinking as a Portuguese . Nevertheless , he was a thorough Gloucesterman , because much of what we have and do is owed to his race . At this hour , he seemed careworn , and I thought that the unexpected labor on the Western Star had set him back . His black hair had long been touched with grey . Indeed , I could n't remember the time when his hair had been all black . Yet I was sure that he aged even more in the few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forge had blackened his face and hands ; and the sparks off his anvil had touched his eyes , so that they were halfclosedand weary-looking . There was more to this than plain weariness . Soon I found out why . We three stood together in the cabin of the Golden Hind and Nora said in her forthright fashion : " Terry , the Western Star and her keel wo n't be enough for us , even if we do find her tied up safe when we get home . We must take fifteen thousand dollars ' worth of fish home , too . Or the Hind will be lost to us . Our debts can go on no longer . " He gave no answer in open words . He looked away from her and sent his gaze a-wandering in his sea-home : that beautifulcabin where the fire shone red as it had shone for him on many a night when the ice was making . Since his expression did not change , I judged that her thought ( the one of loss ) was n't a new one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I said : " I am mate aboard this vessel , Terry , and I 've the right to order you to speak freely to the owner , who has come upon hard times and stands in need of faithful men . " Nora Doonan then asked : " Has Ambrose told you to speak openly to me ? "  | He replied : " He told me you are in trouble , Miss Nora . I know that anyway . " He began a solemn consideration of his next words . He did n't think in English ; and had to turn his thoughts out of Portuguese . At last , he let them go . " Captain Nora , you dress like a man aboard the Hind and in your hard work at home . This I see . You fight like a man for your grandfather , for your schooner and your men . You talk like a man . Yet you are a woman . A young girl to me . So I must ask you this : What say ? Do I talk to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Eh ? " He thrust out his right hand and let it fall on my shoulder . She cried : " For Heaven 's sake  --  for all our sakes !  --  do ! " He spoke in a harsh tone : " All right ! What you mean , Miss Nora , by talking to me about full pens and need of money ? I am only your doryman . " Nora also roughened her manner . Arms akimbo and thumbs thrust into her belt , she at once swept away the barrier ( what remained of it ) by an outright accusation of him . " I mean this , doryman ! How can we kill fish and save ourselves if you 're going to disobey orders aboard this vessel ? Disobey your captainand let dories go over as you let the Corkerys ' go ? And cause men to curse their captain in my hearing ? Tell me that ! " This assault set him free , because he learned that his faithfulnessand skill , long dear to him , had been called into question . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark , ocean-stained cheeks become even darker . He was done with quietness . He roared . " Madre de Deus ! " He swung his hands up to the skylight and held them there , so that he seemed ready to curse his captain as Corkery had cursed him . His eyes glowed , then glittered . He shouted : " Sim ! Sim ! I speak ! "  |p151Wrath  in a young and mighty man is terrible . In this old and mighty man it was awful to behold ; because it came after a lifetime of patience , labor , and courteous actions . Nora Doonan suffered under it . She had no need of his words . His eyes spoke her doom . Nothing untrue could force that beaming . Only the truth , struggling in a faithful heart , could color him so violently and ruin the melody of his voice . She thrust out her arms toward him . In what vain appeal , I do not know . He stepped back and shouted : " It is a lie against me and my chums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terry , never lie . Wine never passes my lips . Nor the lie either . I never disobey . I never make mistake . Never leave the helm until relief . Never let a dory go over when the order is no ' ! " I cried out into his clamor : " Can you deny that Captain LeNotre told you to keep all in nests ? " He paid me no heed . He held us with his gaze and let loose a spate of words in English , all marked with ringing , pious oaths in Portuguese that we knew well . These he would not dare utter foolishly or lightly for fear of his immortal soul . He denied all that the captain had related on the night of the Hind 's return . He declared that the captain had sent him belowand had himself stood the fatal watch . The Corkerys had never demanded that a mark-buoy be set over the fish . Never ! because the Corkerys would have nothing to do with a markbuoy , which they considered a device for unsure men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced them to put their dory over ; and in weather where even the bravest and the best could hardly keep afloat , not to speak of fishing up a drifting buoy . " I tell you more ! " he cried , " and it 's this : that the markbuoygave mark to nothing . No cod under it . Because thep152captain rigged it . And did such a job of rigging that the anchor line parts ! Aye ! " His first fury waned , he fell upon the captain 's pathetic narrative , tore at it , trampled it . In so doing , he made such a proud and passionate defense of his own skill that both Nora and I were overwhelmed , were driven together into unbearableapprehension and despair . I could n't help recalling the display by Captain LeNotre on that night , not long since , when he explained his empty pens by this : " You damned Lisbon , you are on watch and you let a dory out of the nest without sending for me ? An old man like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I knew which man stood damned and which not . Yet it must be that Nora and I should boldly try to shut the gates against this troop of images , marauders sent against our hearts . She , for her reason ; I , for my secret one . Knowing her heart as I knew my own ( because hers had once been mine and mine hers ) , I came closer to her , so that our hands touched , and she seized my hand and cried out : " Do you say that the Corkerys were sent to death and drowning because the captain feared and hated them ? As Parren and Atkins hate and fear ? Do you say that , Terry ? Is this the word I am to bring to my grandfather ? So far gone that I could n't even tell him : James Corkery 's drowned from the deck of our Hind ! ' " This came from the second part of Ambrose 's revelation to her . The Lisbon took no time to measure his words . He said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I tell it to you again . Hate and fear stand in the captain 's heart . " She and I spoke the same word at the same moment : " Why ? "  | " Corkery  --  he knew ! " He gave the word " knew " the clang of a bell-buoy toppling , put such a strain on it that he frightenedus . He filled us with fear of things unknown and clearly to be made known soon . Our fear , which surely touched our staring faces , halted him . In his kindliness and his fatherly love for us ( we having no fathers ) , he had no wish to play this part . I saw pity quench the fury in his eyes , which became dark again and gentler . I waited for Nora Doonan to speak . I glanced sideways at her and saw her teeth bear down on the untinted lip . Since she could n't utter the word , I did so . I said : " Corkery knew what ? " The Lisbon replied : " He knew  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our captain is Parren 's little dog . A little dog to be sent on errands ! " He lingered reluctantly over the unhappy image he had chosen and then , in cold deliberation , added : " A little yellow dog . To fetch "  --  he flung out his right hand  --  " and to carry . " He jerked his left hand upward and let it fall . By this time , so much had been lost to Nora Doonan that she had little left except her sorrow . There was nothing to cry out against , no question of belief or disbelief . She , therefore , put on the Lisbon 's air of deliberateness and asked in a voice so clear and calm that she again amazed me : " You are an old man and a wise one , Terry ! And you say this to me ? " " I am old and I am wise , Miss Nora . And I say it to you . " " Knowing that I am promised to the captain ? " " Knowing so . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and asked : " Then tell me , if you can and will , what was the little yellow dog to fetch and carry for Captain Parren ? Bearing in mind that Captain Parren has always been a friend of ours and has beenp154good to us . Aye ! we 'd not be here now if it had n't been for Captain Parren 's money ! " He sighed over his thoughts of her and I heard him whisper : " A child ! A child ! " I spoke roughly to him . " Out with it ! Answer the owner 's question ! Tell her what the captain was to fetch and carry for Parren ! " He answered : " The Hind ! " " The Hind ! " " What ! my Golden Hind ? " For me : clenched silence . For Nora Doonan : another idol gone . For the Lisbon : a victory , and his first bold step toward the declaration of war which he desired above all things else , even above her present happiness . I read in his changeful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the end , the cool mastery of a man who has the upper hand . By this I mean that he scorned us for our blindness , became savage in his hatred of the enemy captains , and then took hold of himself to be our guide in an hour too harsh for us alone . The Golden Hind put a strain on her mooring lines and swung to the tide . I heard birds calling among her furled sails . I heard the cook coming aft and singing loudly the only song that he could pipe : " Good-bye , my Bluebell , farewell to you ! " He pushed back the companionway slide and came down stern-first , a hod of coals his burden . He swung about and shut his singing mouth . He lowered the hod and , in so doing , looked gravely from face to face . He took his leave without a word . Nora Doonan retreated . She took a step backward and then sat down on the locker , her head bowed , her hands flat atp55her sides . I took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Lisbon began his recital . He had taken a curious stand ; that is , he kept his hands locked behind his back . I was used to this in him . He did it to keep his hands out of the argument . Sometimes they said more than his words . He spoke dryly , dispassionately , as if his shrewdness told him we could do with no more of his anger . He declared that he and others had known for a long time that Captain Parren had no greater wish on earth than to capture the Hind , by hook or by crook . It was for this that he had displayed his generosity , had given to Grandfather Noonan the thousands and to Nora his open wallet . Captain Parren had been earning between twenty and thirty thousand dollars a year on the Doubloon . The vessel herself had been earning five or six times that much ; because he drove her harshly , raided the cod nurseries and killed everythingthat his nets dragged up . " Aye ! he 's one of those hated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small mesh . But why does he do it ? Why go on ? He has much money . More than enough . I tell you , he is crazy for more . That 's why he wishes to be an owner and keep the vessel 's share , too . He has the money to build . But who can build for him ? Nobody ! All must go to the wars . The New York people pay one hundred thousand dollars for the Laura and take her off to the West Indies . They offer more for the Hind . Why ? Because she 's worth a million  --  she could earn so much . This is what Parren knows . It 's not hard to see . Greed is his curse and greed makes him fool you , Miss Nora , and your grandfather . He takes your hand . Only to crush it . He wants the Hind to make her into a dragger as Captain Bannon does . Parren  --  he can not buy her . So he means to drive her to ruin and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , say to him : Ca n't go on ! Take her ! ' " He had now brought his voice down to a dull , matter-offactpitch . He spoke like a man reading a set of figures . He said : " You do n't understand him . Because you can not love money . Young John here  --  he is the same . I tell you  --  unless you love money you can not know men ! You are children . I am a man . All my life I fight for a few dollars to feed the mouths at home . So I become a man . So I know , too , that Parren is in danger . He is great today and he swaggers . But he can lose the Doubloon and all his money . His owners can say : Go ! ' Something hangs over him . Only the Hind can save him from losing all he loves : money . Tomorrow ? The day after ? Who knows ? " In us there was now no wish to keep his knowledge out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by step , he drew closer to the key of all his knowledge : the mystery of the captain 's treachery . He said that the drowned Corkery had actually heard Parren threaten Captain LeNotre with something worse than death unless he contrived to keep the Hind 's pens empty . LeNotre had obeyed , voyage after voyage , by clever means . Yet , in the last few voyages , certain of the Hind 's people , perceiving this betrayal of themselves and their vessel , had pushed their thought into dark corners and had come out with the answer . In my dullness , I said : " Even old Bannister knew . In my presence  --  and in yours , Terry  --  he called the captain Murderer ! ' for the death of Corkery . " I heard her groan . The Lisbon checked me with an upraised hand . Over it , he sent me a glance of warning and he murmured : " Enough ! Enough ! "  | " Aye ! " whispered Nora to herself , " enough ! More than enough ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I cried out : " But there is more ! More to be told . Nothing is to be held back . Nothing ! " The Lisbon spoke sternly to me . " ' Twas n't the drowning of poor Corkery he meant . No ! How could he know of such a thing ? " He bowed his head and whispered : " Not one other word from me in the presence of a woman . " Nora said : " Have done with secrets , once and for all . You 're not speaking in a woman 's presence , Terry . I am an owner . Not a woman . Go on with what you have to say . And make short work of it . For there 's much to do now and much thinking to be done to save us all . " At his hesitation , she again spoke harshly : " Something hangs over Captain Parren ? I heard you . A disgrace that will drive him off the Doubloon . And the same thing hangs over Captain LeNotre and over Billy Atkins ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm right . Why was Atkins chosen to fish with us ? And on my own vessel , the first day out , I saw him speak in a strange way to Captain LeNotre and sneer at him without rebuke or hindrance . I wondered then ! And now  --  while you speak  --  I wonder why Parren can compel and threaten a man like Paul LeNotre . Is it money there , too , Terry ? " He answered without further delay . " There be always two troubles with such men . First  --  money . Second  --  a woman . " At this , she closed her eyes . I knew the image on which she must then dwell for the last time : a blond Viking of a captain , steering the Hind to the Doonan Wharf three years ago and shouting his strange Miquelon oaths to sails and men . She said : " Go on ! " Terry obeyed . " We dorymen know this . Parren  --  he gives money to LeNotre all the time . For rum . For clothes . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earned all this time on the Hind . So , the captain  --  he can not pay Parren back . Yet he must pay him back some way . Some time . Or suffer . " She cried out again . " The woman ! " His mouth became even grimmer at her urging . He had no wish to speak of such things to a girl . He stayed so long that she repeated her question and added to it : " Speak freely , Terry . Speak your piece . I 've not been knocking around these vessels all my life for nothing . " " The woman ? Miss Nora , to us woman spells money . And money spells woman . Without money  --  no woman . Without woman  --  no money . Why fish ? " He caught himself up quickly and said in a lower tone : " For myself , Miss Nora , I have my fun at home . You see , I speak to you like a man . " He flung out his hands freely then and said his say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Parren , Atkins , and your captain . They were friends  --  good friends  --  before the captaincomes to Gloucester that time . Now , there was a woman in Yarmouth . A beautiful woman . I have seen her in their company . Off the Big Miquelon she is . And bought by the rich Bannister . Bought , but not kept . Next she is Captain LeNotre 's woman . Because he knew her when a boy . Then Captain Parren  --  he buy her . With his money . With his draggermoney . She lives in style that time . Then he gives her back to Captain LeNotre . Like that ! Generous . Then , Miss Nora , they both have her for a time . And quarrel over her . " cried : " You mean they shared a woman ? Is that what you are trying to say ? Paul LeNotre and that old man ? " He shook his head in bewilderment . " She shared them , John . The Hind goes out from Yarmouth after taking bait . Woman goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Woman comes back to Yarmouth and waits for the Hind . Hind stays too long . " He fumbled over the wooden words and whispered swifter ones in Portuguese . He then looked at her in a strange , fierce way and said : " Now comes death ! " " Ah ! " " Who knows ? Who can tell ? ' T is nothing ! Many die or are gone and never heard from . One night in Yarmouth they find her . The shore patrol . Gaffed in the snow-drift , she is . " He swept his hand upward in a jerky motion that made us shudder . " A knife ! Who knows what knife ? Even Corkery is not sure and he was ashore . Daniel , I mean , on the Doubloon now . Is it a knife with a queer hilt of bone ? I do n't know . And why must she die ? I do n't know that either , young John . But some men say they know why . Bannister  --  he makes no bones about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the drowned Corkery knew and it may be yet that even powerful captains can be found out and hanged . " Nora Doonan asked : " When was this ? " " Last winter . " She kept down her cry , but I could n't keep down my own ; for I remembered her winter and the firelit nights passed with her lover in the old house at home . The Lisbon said : " This I do know ; each man has killed before now . On the Banks , or the Miquelons , or ' longshore . They were devils together ! One way or the other , they killed . " He was aware of the devastation he had made within Nora Doonan . Her wretched mouth and faded cheeks told him ; and half-closed , unseeing eyes . He could n't face her . Knowingthis , she came up to him and said : " Of all those who knew , you alone told me . Told us . I 'll not forget . I 'll always be thankful , Terry . My life had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Here she held back words of grief , braced up and went on speaking . " The vessel remains . John and I will sail with her . I 've given Ambrose my promise to do so . Even before today . The captain will remain the captain for the time being . I 'll not speak of such matters to him yet . I must watch and wait . Oh , I believe you ! To my sorrow , I must and do . But I must act in disbelief . As if it all had to be proved and  --  " He broke into her bewailing : " It will be proved ! Fait ! " He held up his hand to gain time for his thought . " The last hour has come for them . We have brought it . You have , Miss Nora ! The Western Star and her keel is our way out . She is ready . Sixteen thousand dollars for her  --  aye ! and more . And a grand stock of fish . Ah , you 'll see , Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to you from Parren  --  maybe today  --  and say : Sell the Golden Hind for one hundred and twenty thousand dollars ! ' Watch ! " Nora replied : " We must watch and wait . But you tell the men  --  those that do n't know  --  all you 've told us . Let them be watchful , too . " I said : " All save bloody Atkins . " She flung on her jacket . " We 'll all go back to the Star now for the last day 's work . All will be well . " " All will be well , Nora ! " " All will be well , Captain Nora . " A silence lay on the deck of the Western Star when we boarded her . The men were thronged around the mainmast . The men of the Irish Regiment stood at solemn attention , fingers to caps . That mast had no sail ; and was stepped only for stays and other standing gear . She was to go under foresailonly , that being all five men could handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mainmast . I saw the captain amongst them . I saw old Ambrose lift his hand and ,  |p161in  obedience , another hand hauled the colors of our Republic briskly until they unfolded in the westerly breeze . There was no laughter , no cheering . All hands knew what the old dorymenhad before them . We said : " So long ! " and " See you in Gloucester ! " and " Good luck , chums ! " We returned to the Hind , took in her mooring lines , and sailed down the stream . The Western Star swayed up her little spread and came jauntily after us and passed through the gate . For an hour the Hind and the Star sailed together in the waning light . When we had put Seal Island Light and the rocks well behind us , the Star 's people gave us a farewell shout and she fell onto the windward tack heavily , forcefully . The last I saw of her was a blow of sparks out of the galley pipe and a curl of wood smoke . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she lingered briefly , black and long , and at her helm a little band of bowed men , their broad backs gleaming . I looked after her with longing . I longed for the day when I should greet the hero . The Golden Hind sped eastward . The captain had the helm . I stood by him and waited for his nod . I took a step forward and shouted the stand-by signal : " Hard alee ! Oh , make it lively , boys ! " " Hard alee ! " The cry bowled forward and ran upward through her crowded sails . Captain LeNotre brought her sweetly into the wind . The dorymen shouted , hauled , and shouted . Booms and sails came shouting over and the Golden Hind , finding the wind even fairer now , plunged handsomely into the rolling night . Full of foreboding , heavy-hearted with it , I took the helm from him and stood my watch on the passage to the Banks . And I can say that I found little of my old joy in the stars of autumn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A sou'wester is never in debt to a no'theaster . " Words that smell a little of the countinghouse ; and I daresay it was an owner who coined it . Yet it 's a true saying ; for , on the score of fierceness , ' t is six of one and half a dozen of the other , although the no'theaster is more likely to blow a man home . These gales are born far apart ; and die so . That is their only difference . One is the land 's gift to the sea ; the other is the sea 's gift to the land . Tit for tat . Riding either out is poor living . The ride 's the same : now high , now low , now on beam-ends , and then , perhaps , hove down and fires out . However , it is graciously arranged by Nature that these blows never vary . They come and they go , always sending the same signals before , always hauling them down at departure . Blue water becomes black . Whitecaps vanish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat . Sun-rays pierce the greenhorn 's heart , make it blithe . It is a mystery to him . None to us . None to the Lisbons , who are kith and kin to the gales ; are their beloved children . No change in a far-off hue escapes them , on bow-watch or helmwatch . A darkening sea darkens their eyes . The waning of one harshness in the Atlantic clamor fills their hearts with stir . Before the glass knows , they know . The eternal clock is wound up . Let it unwind . It is only discipline , by which men keep free , that sends them below to read a bill of particularsp163off the glass , a finite change in infinite weights and pressures , narrated by a column of mercury in a cup of glass , our heirloomout of the dark . " She fall two tenth since noon . " The Golden Hind was sailing across Emerald Bank when the Lisbon passed this word to Nora Doonan and to me . We two were standing in the sunny shelter between the dorynests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's worth the candle : the one which leads to action . Which thought was apt to make a proper haul out of the fathoms ? Man 's or woman 's ? Hard to say , even if we had been left alone . I had my wisdom . She had hers . These were not yet joined . I pondered as a man of the sea ; she , as a woman . Not an ordinary woman , content to stand aside and deny all that must be true of womanhood , which can not differ from manhood in reckless daring . No , she pondered as a free woman , forced by need and by hardy inclination to take a part in men 's affairs , to live and work and fight amongst us . She asked no favor because she stood on the distaff side . Indeed , she had now learned to expect less goodness from men than they customarily extend to themselves . No other thought than her own had true value . Well ! whatever clue our minds may have been seeking , all came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm . Slanting from heights unimaginably above the water world , the universal order shot its changeless signal down to our sea , into our cabin , giving us an hour 's notice that a vast bustle was required in those parts . An hour 's notice , also , that any little arrangements we might make were to be set aside . And to be forgotten forever ! Because this that rises beyond is the sou'wester , the wind of which I earlier spoke and by which our destiny is to be shaped.  | The watch came up from the cabin and spoke to the helmsman . A moment later , Captain LeNotre , who had been sleeping , came on deck and turned his bare , golden head this way and that . He scanned the empty sky and snuffed up the spray . He lifted his hand , jerked it downward . At once , the topmastmenjumped into the swifters . The main-sheet gang hauled down on the staysail . Her topsails folded . Soon her pace declined . The watch changed . The man who had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old took his hands off the spokes , he sang out : " East-by-South ! One hour ! " The new watch chanted : " East-by-South ! One hour ! " and looked into the binnacle to see that the course was the one he must keep for his hour on duty . The dorymen shoved their tubs of bait back toward the main hatch and they thrust bait-knives down into bulwark sheaths . Tubs of trawl went sliding into their old places along the rail . The washing-tubs were again lashed to the chains . I went down the ladder into the pens and handled the bait . Not much had gone up . I shovelled herring into Number One pen and threw the ice back . I looked idly into the empty pens , wondering if ever they would be full of fish ; and I felt , as often before , how the storm made itself known in those dark bins more strongly than it did on deck . The air was already close below . There was a booming in it . I returned to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He says : Bring up the bottom ! ' " " Bring up the bottom ! Aye ! " I looked toward the forecastle companionway and met the cook 's expectant gaze . He nodded and backed down the steps to his icebox . I turned to Nora and said : " ' T is hauling to the south'ard . Bad luck ! "  | " It is , indeed , John . " No fear for the Hind herself drove the little cheerfulness from our faces . We knew which was stronger : schooner or gale , oak or wind , spar or wave . No , it was to the greying west that our hearts turned in sea-wise dismay . There , unless some mishap had already maimed her , the precious Western Star must now be creeping down the coast to Cape Ann . Her exact course could n't be known to us because it had been left to old Ambrose to reckon how he should steer after he dropped Seal Island Light . Two general courses had been open to him . he might drive straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open sea . Or he might run from one harbor to the next , ready to take shelter in case of a blow . His job was to save the great keel and bring it to the meltingpot . Yet this storm had already risen in the west and , for all we knew , it might have swept between him and the land . I lent a hand to the gripes for the double-lashing of the dories . It was no wonder that she and I became sullen . The anxious faces of the dorymen made us so , though we were bent toward anger . A little while before , the men had been eager for the fishing . On the voyage out of Shelburne , the prospect of gettingsome hooks down to the bottom had made the men gay . I was aware , too , that they considered our presence aboard as a guarantee that fish would be killed if fish were found . There had been boasts in the forecastle and happy calculations on Boston prices . And their habit of good fellowship had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the newness of their plight , being for the first time ever at sea with a captainwhom they must look upon as a sort of madman . I did so well that I spoke decently even to Billy Atkins when I had to speak . I found no trouble , either , in working with the captain , who had himself put a good face on it and had driven the Hind skillfully to this place for her first set . It was true that both Nora and I found the meal-time meetings a. little trying because all hands seemed so openly intent on shaking off the queer forebodings and Jonah talk that had marked the earlier stages of the Hind 's voyage . These moods persisted in wary glances and shut-off sentences , which became more frequent as the Lisbon 's story passed amongst them . Despite the despair and doubt in her heart , Nora , too , soon caught the genial infection and shared their hope of a certain harvest and a quick one . Such a boon seemed sure to them all . Their confidencerested on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had been explained to them that without a good stock and fair prices at home , the Golden Hind could n't go on . The cook handed me a round , thick pat of butter , and made his old joke by shaking his head over it and saying : " Bring it back , kid , when you 're done with it . " I let out the usual shout of laughter and started aft . A glitteringhump of spray slewed us around and I said : " Better oil up , Nora . ' T is coming along fast , I guess . " She followed me to the break and watched while I jammed the butter into the hollow tip of the lead . I cast the lead far forward and let the line pay out , watching the markers as it ran . I worked aft a bit and presently hauled briskly , hand over hand . Without looking at the armed tip , which would have been a breech of custom aboard the vessel , I handed it to the captain . He turned it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched it with his forefinger . He rubbed his finger back and forth lightly over the butter . He frowned . The gravel was n't fine enough . He knew where he was by this touch of the finger . It was n't where he wanted to be . " Forty fathom , " I said . " Not bank enough ? "  | " We 're almost on it . " He gave back the lead and took thought . " Heave her to . We 'll have to ride it out here , if we can . " Gale and night met above her topmasts and wrestled there . Out of the last flare in the northwest , a purple cloud spouted and then soared , an immense rocket trailing sun-fire from one rim of the world to the other . The blow fell upon the Golden Hind from that arch . She sprang to meet it . The first boarding sea filled her gangways , forced her down , and kept her so until the following seas piled on her . These came with the usual uproar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She cleared herself and came up to take a breath full of frost and spray . No sooner had she shaken off that first rattling welter than another and larger sea came in over the same quarter and hit her like a thousand of brick . The booming of her pens Itoudened in the cabin . And there came such a queer noise of rending that Nora , stretched out in her bunk , could n't help raising her hand ; for it seemed to us that some of the gear had parted and had cut across the deck like a scythe . In the next instant , that tearing sound came again . This time it shrieked against the blackened skylight and rattled in such a way that we knew it was hail , driven down like pellets of iron . The wind then began slambanging all around the compass and punished the schooner so harshly that even the dorymen in the cabin bunks became alert and showed some signs that they feared a freakish storm which might suddenly defeat them . This oddness in the whirl of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it . She was at her wit 's end . She failed to keep her head into it , no matter how the watch labored at her helm . The sea cheated our skill and gave the Hind such a hammering that soon it was plain a new thoughtp168was running in our minds : is this the one ? The seas ran over her bow with such force that it was n't possibly to keep a watch forward . The captain finally went on deck . A little later , my bunk-mate followed , taking with him a coil of rope to lash himself to the wheel , for the watch was changing and it was his trick again , it being impossible for the men forward to come aft . When Captain LeNotre came down , I watched him anxiouslyand saw with relief that he sat down as usual on the locker to pull off his boots . He had only one of them free when the Lisbon , who was lying in the bunk just aft of Nora 's , slipped out and stood in his stocking-feet on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such intensity that one might think he could pierce hull and keel and thus draw up some secret of the storm from the bottom . Shouting through the din , the captain asked : " What say , Terry ? " " I hear ! You hear ? " He lifted his hand and beat time to some far-off resounding music that he had chosen amongst all the other strains and discords . The repeated signals of his arm soon gave us the clue ; and my own ear caught the bass note in the west . This grew in grandeur as the music-maker advanced . The captain put on his boot again and waited . The Lisbon let his arm fall . The rhythmic succession of loud notes had now merged into one vast clamor . All lesser sounds vanished . The great sea struck and rolled on , taking the Hind with it as if she were a chip ; which , indeed , she had become , for all her hundred tons . Her lee rail went far down and her stern sank in the same overturning whirl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunk ; so that she had a hardp169time of it and clung on only by gripping the side with both her hands . A shower of small gear and boots rattled across the cabin . The Lisbon , who was hanging on to the companionway , glanced sharply at the stove . It was red under the door . The vessel whirled three times in that topsy-turvy style ; then slowly , beam by beam , she found herself . Her hold began to boom the old chant again . Captain LeNotre staggered across the litter and joined us at the companionway . We stared at one another in an unseeingway . We listened for a signal from the men at the wheel . It came soon : three sharp blows against the slide . This meant that the helmsmen , lashed to the wheel in the loose Gloucester style that would save them from strangling , had hung on through the worst blow . " Old Hind  --  she win ! " The Lisbon rolled back into his bunk . That was the end of freakishness . There was much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear of it . He called out cheerfully and to signify the further change in his opinions , moved both his hands outward in a flat gesture . I Ic picked up a Sunday hat off the locker and tucked it away . Nora pulled the blankets over her again and lay there all the night while the Hind fought out the longer battle . The rising of the sun ( such as it was ) brought us a little while of ease . The cook sent down a kettle of coffee and a bag of rolls by the hands of forecastle men , who had rigged lifelines at daybreak . The watches now changed regularly . Weary under the hammering and lack of the big meals which their strength demanded , the men passed into the useful silence by which quarrels are avoided and the work smoothly shared and done . Nevertheless , despite this discipline which we laid upon ourselves , the strength of the storm mauled us when the day waned . The hour came when the heave-to manoeuvre had to end ; for the Hind was living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tea and a crock of cakes . He said aloud : " I never liked Emerald Bank this time o ' year . " He had just come from the forecastle , where many wise seamen lay , making up judgments never to be ignored . He himself was one of the best seamen in the fleet ; and he always had time to do his thinking and listening . For these reasons , his remark amounted to a suggestion from the crew . This was customary in the fleet , where the day 's work had to be directed by joint experience and thought . I said in a louder tone : " What 's that you say , cook ? " For I had noticed that the captain , for whom the words were intended , had n't heard them . The cook said it over again . Apparently some new move had been making up in Captain LeNotre 's mind , his skill being equal to any other in such matters . Between swallows out of his mug , he spoke to me . " Let her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anyway , and that 's where we want to be . " I went on deck and let the Hind run before the gale . In her relief and joy , she made such handsome going of it that no sea could catch her hard . She flew up the steep hillsides and toppled down . Two or three times , in the late afternoon , she buried her lee side to the hatches , but she cleared herself withoutmuch trouble . At four o'clock or so an airplane carrier and a number of destroyers came up to the eastward . Half an hour later , the vessels changed course and vanished in the vapor . In the dusk , the Golden Hind ran for her life before the gale . It soon came my turn again and I went on deck a little after midnight . I found her driving in toilsome fashion throughp171thick vapor and a rain that kept turning into hail and back again . I leaned against the wheel , my belly roaring for food and my hands taking on the dead set of exhaustion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could go together on the wheel . I could scarcely see him ; for the hail kept my eyes half-shut . Indeed , I shut them altogether at times because the hail swept against us in volleys straight off the water . At times the hail struck the bulwarks and skylight with a clankingsound , like skylights breaking . The Hind 's eagerness grew with the force of the gale . She pitched badly and then flew up the white seas in a crazy , twisting motion that made me quake ; and made my chum twist his mouth against my ear to speak in the din . I felt , even in my numbness , the scrape of his unshaven , iced-up jaw . He shouted : " John , can you , for  --  " But at that very moment the Hind flung herself across a frosty summit and there leaned almost in a pause , only to start forward violently when the roller surged under and away . She seemed air-borne ! I swear her whirling bow thrust out into nothingness . She toppled and dived down into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out from under me and I fell like a green fool face-down into a pour of water deep enough to drown me . A jerky strain on the rope that lashed us to the wheel turned me to my knees . A hand reached out of the dark and pulled . I crawled against the wheel and got my fingers back onto the spokes . At that moment , when I was looking for her to climb out of there , a freakish cross-sea struck her hard at about the main weather rigging  --  the port  --  and she passed directly into a black wall which tumbled upon her . But in vain ! Her great buoyancy outmatched the tons of water and she bore upwards , , shuddering and straining , and flung us into the air again : .  | About this time , a light pierced the pitch-black near at hand . I let out a yell , not knowing , in my blindness , whence it came ; and then I saw the figure of a man , black and bowed , against a dim glow rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slide shot into place behind him , he flung himself boldly into the stream and came up between us ; and I felt a new and powerful strain on the wheel , which by now was something that two men could hardly handle . It was the captain . He shouted some word to encourage us and I passed the lashing to him . Thus we three straddled it through the night until the sun came up in a murky dawn . Weak enough was that sun ; nevertheless , it scoffed up part of the gale and gave us strength . Soon it cleared a little in the east . The captain said : " Go forward , John , and get a man or two into the bow . If you think they can stand it . " I left the wheel and went forward on the lines . In a cautious way at first , because I was numbed and harshly beaten ; and I kept in mind that a long time had passed since I had undergonesuch labor . Before I reached the break ( which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good breach through the clouds . I jumped into the shelter of the dory-nests . It was easier there . I kept an eye on the forecastle companionway , for I did n't want to be caught there by a boarding sea . ' T was my good luck ! A doryman fell cautiously back from the lee of the foremast and I saw that the bow-watch had gone up the moment it was possible . This was Ernie Wagner , a Nova Scotian of my long acquaintance , and a better doryman never came out of the Provinces . His present action stayed me where I crouched . Ile kept raising his head to take a look over the weather rail . Since this did n't satisfy him , he ran to the fore rigging and hauled himself up . I saw him twist arm and leg 3into the shrouds . He again raised his head to peer into the scud to windward . I fell back and made my way up the deck between the starboarddory-nest and the rail . By this change , I was nearer and could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When it ran off between the nests , I saw that he had climbed higher . It was plain to me that he sighted something to windward of us . I wished to see what it was . I could see nothing from my place . Yet I understood that he might want to send word aft in a hurry . So I stayed . It seemed to me that he might hear my voice . I cried out his name . He turned his head and shouted something which I could n't make out at all . IIe strained upwardand once more looked away . When he twisted toward me again , his face revealed considerable excitement . IIe thrust him arm directly to windward and shouted ; then he drew that arm in and held his other stiffly to leeward , which was a signal . I ran aft and told the captain to take her off a point or two , that the watch had sighted a vessel on our course . Or dangerouslynear it . By this time the Hind was in such shape that others had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doonan and the Lisbon . She seemed tired , which was natural enough considering the state of things below . The Lisbon kept close to her . I began making my way forward . I found a doryman clinging to the main rigging . He shouted : " Ernie says there 's a vessel on the weather quarter . Coming up fast ! Ca n't make her out . A dungeon of fog ! " This was risky business . Plenty of sea-room was needed in such a blow , especially because the vapor rolled in thick now and then . I was n't sure the Hind had given the stranger a wide enough berth . I sent the doryman aft with his message . Hep174came back soon and gave me the all-right signal . Nora and the Lisbon followed him . They got into the lee of the dorynest . I waited until the way was clear . I jumped into the swifters and found a place below Ernie Wagner . There I clung , flying ' twixt night and day , to watch the next act in the drama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vein , written by no mean scribbler , played by no mean hero . Doryman Wagner struck me on the shoulder . He then held his arm out so that I might look along it . His Land pointed directly into a stream of vapor that was closing in from the northwest . The wind , which was still a gale beyond , kept breaking into that stream , made aisles and frothy vistas in it . Some were shallow , some were caves , some the depth of a mile . Hills of water , black-sided and white-topped , surged across these vistas ; or filled them entirely with spouts and falls of foam . I gazed eagerly . Presently I saw a duller gleam of light shoot across one of the openings . Wagner shouted . The dull gleam vanished . I could see no more . I then heard shouts below me . I bent backward and saw four or five dorymenclinging to the gripes and staring into the vapor . Nora and the Lisbon stood amongst them , their eyes fixed on the sea . I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see a certain distance now ; for the Hind sailed at a smoother clip , although her speed seemed to be even greater . It was this great speed that kept her in constant danger ; because there was n't much steering that could be done under such circumstances . I turned back to the sea again , waiting for a clue to be tossed up in the wilderness . Soon I saw the same dullish lightp175about half a mile nearer . This time I clung to it , followed its pell-mell passage and narrowly judged its speed , so that I could pick it up when it jumped across clear water . In such a way , I looked ahead and far down into an enormous cavern . In its middle , a sea began rising , and seemed to force the ivory walls and dripping arch outward by its force . I saw the burstingof the western wall . I saw the Western Star careen into that cavern . A wail blew over the Hind 's deck . I stared in deepest sorrow at that beautiful hull , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare deck , a mainmast gone by the board , a sail in ribbons , and a black , gleaming mound at her smothered helm . The mound , I knew , could only be her dorymen , lashed to the wheel and driving onward to a fate that I foresaw only too well . Even before this thought could take shape ( tho ' it had been formed a hundred times in the nights past ) , the vessel tumbled over that sea and vaulted out of sight . I let myself down to the deck and made my way to Nora 's side . She shrank against the weather nest ; indeed , almost cowered there , her face held close to the sideboards . There was nothing I could say to her . It had been made plain to us that we had lost the battle ; and this much more : that five old friends were gone , unless all signs failed . Men who had stood by her for the sake of a daring heart . And the precious keel !  --  it would go sliding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston . The Lisbon held Nora by the arm and said to me : " You saw ? Her deck was under ! " He flung his hand out and down in a swooping motion , by which he meant to signify her plunge . There was new sorrow . But no blame to be taken in grief.  | We knew that Ambrose and his chums were fated to die that way . It was what they were for ; what they had been seeking all their lives . Now it had come . It was not a question of blame or remorse . There was only pity . I hated , as she hated with all her great strength , the final image of their descent and surrender , their capitulation to the gale . I could see them bow their heads , could hear old Ambrose , jovial to the last , even in drowning . " Salubrious , is it not , my good friend ? " All hands soon had the news of the Western Star 's passage . They took it in the accustomed way : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost . The passage was recountedwith poorly hidden satisfaction by Billy Atkins , who could say , without hurting the truth much : " I told you so ! " Captain LeNotre learned it , no doubt , with a similar emotion , although he still had enough manhood left in him to keep his face solemn . He did it with such scant grace , however , that I said to the Lisbon , as we stood by the wheel that night : " I wish that man would learn to blush for himself . I 'm tired of doing it for him . " The worst of our toil was over ; and the Hind went under a reefed mainsail . I went below once to see Nora . I went in the hope that the sight of her might stir me to speak words of comfort . Yet , when I met her eyes , as she lay sleepless on her blankets , the grief in them left me without words . I reached out and touched her hand . To this , she paid no heed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Middle Ground ( northwest of Sable Island ) when the gale blew itself out . The Atlantic becameblue . Whitecaps filled the east . A blue wind came out of the west . At once , the schooner took up her work again . Having given the sou'wester its due , the Hind proceeded to the last and final act : her attempt to save herself . By herself . All the good habits of the Gloucester fleet came to the vessel 's aid . Cook turned out another feast of beefsteaks and doubled the strength of the coffee . The icing on the chocolate cakes lay thick as fudge . The men ate again and the breaking of our fast gave us some cheer . We spoke well of the gale and said : " A fair blow ! Took us where we wanted to be . " Old hands in the oldest of all the Republic 's trades , old in her oldest sorrow ( which is loss at sea ) , the dorymen now turned to . The word passed : " Bait up ! Bait up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had n't gone ahead on their own tucked their pipes away and came on deck . Once again , the frosty herring came up by the tubful from the pens . The cutting-boards were set up between the dory-nests and along the bulwarks . Long , broad knives  --  a score of them  --  began the old play : down the bait twice and thrice across . Once the heaps of bait began to pile up , ten men quit cutting and turned to the tubs of trawl . While their dorymates cut on , these others uncoiled the trawls and began the rapid baiting of hooks , attached to the trawl line by shorter lines called gangins . They coiled the baited trawls back into the tubs ; and those that finished first came to help me and Billy Atkins , who had the rating of greenhorns because our hands were out of practice . Sidewise sweeps of knives sent the herring-heads flying ; and golden herring-eyes , full of tardy suspicion , stared from deck and scuppers . Nora turned to with shovel and broom to the greenhornjob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads over the side , where the gulls fed . The knives struck faster and faster until the blunt tattoo rang louder than the gay talk and the shouts to the men in the pens . The talk became gay , as it always does when the fishing draws nigh ; so gay , indeed , that at times it became a chant . One of little meaning , except for the hopes of happiness thus repeated . Yet it fell short of song . No man ever sang a song for a Grand Banks harvest ; and no man 's ever made one . Nor will now . Within the hour , the first cry of " Enough ! " was raised and the trawl-tubs began sliding toward the dory-nests . Number One Dory had been the Corkerys ' . To it , Billy Atkins and I dragged our tubs , fresh chunks of herring gleaming on the topmost coils . The other dorymen stood by the lee tackle and swung Number One up and out over the rail and held it swayingthere while we finished the stowing of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anchors , water-bottle , conch horns , gobsticks and gaffs . And a bag of bread , too , because this was the season when dories might be lost in the vapor and had no choice except the long row to land , with sad failure the usual portion . Half in the dory , half out , I lay poised on the gunwale with the black key-buoy in my arms , its blackball  --  a flag marked " I "  --  flapping in my face . And there I kept a watchful perch until .. . " Buoy away ! " The captain shouted and jerked his arm . I tossed the buoy down into the sea . We took our places : Atkins at the oars and I at the first tub of trawl . " Dory away ! " Number One dropped into the stream and the Hind , under foresail only , ambled on against the tide . I dropped over the anchor to hold our buoy in this starting-place and looked up at the captain . He held out his arm to the southward . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen because it would give us a chance to haul with the tide , a saving of labor and of straining gear . Once away , I slipped my heaving-stick , a willow wand , into the topmost coil of trawl . I flipped it up and outward . The baited hooks began to fly and soon the first string of the mile-long trawl , with its hundreds of hooks , was slowly driftingto the bottom , fifty fathom down . When I had emptied the first tub of its trawl , I knotted the second tub 's line to the heaved one and kept on . By that time , the Hind was growing small in the west and all her twelve dories lay at work on the set , the rowers bending back and forth , the heavers up and down . This was the old flying-set , as practiced on the Golden Hind . And , since it had been my first work in the fisheries when a boy , I rejoiced in it . So much so , indeed , that I could pull out a grin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a dory ever since he got a site aboard his first dragger . Some years ago , that was . " You making out well , Billy ? " I asked . He grunted over the oars , which he found heavy . " She 's cranky  --  this dory is. "  |p180I  've no understanding at all ( even now ) of the inner machinerythat made me jump at this chance to cast the lead into his shallows . ' T is a mystery to me . All I know is that , without the grace of hesitation , I shouted : " Corkery never found it so ! " Atkins jumped at my mention of the man who had once sat on that thwart , had tumbled to his death from it . I laughed at his ready fear and anger and I made up my mind that I 'd try again as soon as the set was done . It would n't be wise to break into that ! I grinned and said : " She wo n't be cranky once we haul a few good cod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think we will . " I paused a split second in my heaving and looked sharply at a hook hanging over my stick . " You cut bait a little fine , Billy , my boy . I 'll tell you that for next time . " Atkins chose to ignore this . He said : " Tide 's strong here . " " No stronger than a hundred years ago , I guess . You want me to spell you at the oars ? " " Heave away ! " Coming now to the last coil in the last tub , I knotted the trawl to the anchor line , which was fast to another black buoy , and heaved the gear over with a sign to Atkins that he should ship his oars . This done , I set up the little mast and unfurled our leg-o ' - mutton sail . I brought the dory around with a steering-oarand she began her homeward run . Atkins lay down on the bottom boards to keep out of the wind , which had a bite in it . Number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish the set , by virtue of our head start . The others were not tardy . Soon their little sails appeared at varying distances . It was a pretty sight , long not seen by me , and now enjoyed . A few sails were old and stained yellow by sun and salt . Some were newp181white ; and , farther off , a blue sail and a green shone , making the day a gala one , a regatta off Cape Ann . In the west , her foresail flashing , the Golden Hind began her turn toward the first buoy . I also steered to that buoy , which was ours . Long before I could make out Nora Doonan at the helm , I saw my bouncing keg . I tied up to it , there to await the fishing signal from the captain , to whom it was left to judge when the cod had time to finish luncheon . While I was furling the sail , and again when I made the empty tubs ready to take in trawl , I saw a queer sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was needed to sharpen me than any sort of cheerfulness from Atkins , LeNotre , or Captain Parren of the Doubloon . They were all sharks to me ; and they livened up only when there was blood in the spray . As soon as the dory was fast to the buoy , Atkins had gone back to his thwart . There he filled his pipe and puffed away . A true draggerman , he was happiest while sitting down . A little later he grunted in a pleasant , shoatish way . This pleasure was too brisk , even for such a pipe as his ; and I figured out soon enough that he had seen something that I had n't made out yet . At first , with a thrill that pierced me harshly , I guessed that the rascal had caught sight of some sign of the Western Star 's wreck . I tried him out on this score , but I made nothing of his grunting and spitting . In the course of my thought , I struck on Parren and the Doubloon , and said at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . Parren said he 'd be here . " This ordinary conjecture must have seemed like magic to the stupid Atkins . He dropped his pipe to the bottom boards and cursed in a wail . He was n't smart enough to keep his eyes off the sea ; that is , if it really was his hope to hide something from me . He shot a sideways glance to the east.  | I stood up and looked in that direction . A dragger steamed there , black amidst blue and white . " Why ! " I said , " there 's the top Jonah now , I do believe ! " I spoke in cautious cheerfulness , lest the draggerman see that I was upset . The coming of the Doubloon was n't good news to me , although I had it much in mind since Parren 's farewell to us at the Doonan Wharf . I had my share of seaman 's superstitionand really considered Atkins as a Jonah , a source of bad luck and sorrow . And , rightly enough , I now considered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom much evil came . I was more than ready to make a haul on my own account . I judged that the time had come . I must confess that , under such circumstances , I could be as mean as any man I ever heard of . I had a tongue in my head and bitter thoughts to put an edge on it . More than that , I knew my man and had turned over in my memory the savage hints that lay a-plenty in the yarn spun by the Lisbon . I , therefore , faced Atkins and blandly said : " Ever see a man hanged , Billy ? " As I spoke , I ran a finger inside the collar of my sweater . A damnable gesture for a man to make . Worse , I also thrust my tongue far out and let it loll . What possessed me to play such a grim game at such a time is more than I can tell . Billy Atkins bounced again . " Hanged ? Hey ? How could I ? See a man hanged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did some damage to him . He said " No ! " again and again . I put on a rueful look and said with a sigh : " To chuck away a man like that ! Dear me ! " " Chuck a man away ? Chuck who away ? What the hell 's wrong here , anyway ? " " Why ! nothing 's wrong , chum , nothing . Only I had that dream of mine last night again . About Nora Doonan 's father.  | ( This was true . ) And he was standing by a gallows  --  or under a yard-arm . I could n't make it out , Billy . Not quite . And he was making that old crack of his . You know -- If they hang you , my friend , somebody 's going to be hurt ! ' Ha ! Ha ! " I peered under my hand and said : " It 's the Doubloon all right . I only hope that chump does n't drag his bag over our trawls . If he does  --  I 'll bust him one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hang ? " His own rich stream of superstition had been muddied . He was seeking an omen . " You saw somebody under a yard-arm ? That 's what you say , is it ? " " Bless my soul ! " I pretended surprise that my dream should interest him so much . " Bless my soul , Billy ! " I held up my words with some skill , and thus made it clear that , much against my wishes , I was being forced into a revelation I 'd rather not make , especially to a man on the anxious seat , where the Lisbon had put him . " Now that you ask me  --  and I make the effort to recall  --  why ! yes , Billy , there was a face above the noose . Not what you 'd call a pretty face . Or a happy face . No ! But a face , nevertheless . " I had him in a dogfish gape by this time . I put on a graver air . " Of course , a man ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " " Whose face in the noose ? From a yard-arm ? Ah , that 's a pretty yarn to tell a man ! And you ca n't remember , eh ? " " I did n't say that , Billy . Oh , I can remember all right . I just said a man ca n't be sure of a face seen in a dream . Say , you kiss a girl in a dream . Or she cottons up to you . Well  --  take my advice !  --  do n't act too hasty on it next day . " I saw that Atkins was too frightened to repeat his question ; so I said in the judicious style : " You know , Billy , there 's some truth in dreams after all . Because I happen to know that for crimes at sea you can be hanged . "  | " Me ? " Atkins pushed some spittle out onto his lips with his tongue . His Adam 's apple jerked sadly . " You ? " I said . " Excuse me , chum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ' in a manner of speaking . A general sort of way . I meant a man can be hanged for crimes at sea . That 's all . " " Aye ! " " As for that face , Billy , I 'll tell you whose it was . Pass me your word first that you 'll never breath it to a living soul . " " Aye ! " " Tell it to a ghost , Billy , if you like . Happen you meet one real soon . But not to a living soul . Hey ? " " As God is my judge  --  " he began loudly . I gave him a solemn signal to stop that line . " That face , Billy , a-hanging there under the midday sun , was Parren 's or "  --  I fumbled a bit  --  " or LeNotre 's  --  or  --  " He groaned aloud when I kept slowly on. "  --  or , if not one of those two thieves , Billy , then  --  " He slapped his hands down to the thwart to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was  --  " I , for once , did n't know what to say . I was stumped . I wished to say : " Your face , Billy boy ! " but , by this time , the sweat on that narrow forehead and the patient agony in his eyes had stirred up my pity , of which I still had scanty store . I laid off . I said : " Why ! it was Corkery 's face ! Corkery off the Doubloon ! " This blind shot nailed him , gaffed him . He gripped the streaming thwart with both his hands and screamed . His face lost the drawn look that his suffering had put there and it became twisted with fury . " He wo n't . He wo n't get me ! I 'll rip him first ! Gut him !  --  by the God that made me ! " I give you my word , his teeth were hidden in foam out of his mouth.  |p185His  next words , which were uttered in the same shrill and raspy voice , baffled me entirely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there  --  oh ! nothing , Captain , nothing ! So help me , God ! " It was my turn to be frightened , frightened by his fear , because it was a true token of guilt , if not on his part , then on the part of others . I did n't know which way to turn . I had a notion that if I jumped on him and throttled him a while , I 'd have gotten much out of him , but I could n't resist his pitifulstate . I was bent on a good-natured rescue of him , by some light word or other , when two blasts from ships ' horns blew by me , the first from the east , the second from the west . Both were fishing signals . The Doubloon had finished its draggingand Parren had blown his horn to order his men to the winch and the bag to the top . I saw the Doubloon increase speed and steer sharply to leeward , which was the side she was dragging on . The Doubloon , having closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to haul it up . I heard the rasp of wires and winch . I saw how taut the wire cables of the net were at the rail and I knew this meant a good bag . Since my own captain had also blown the fishing signal , I went into the bow of our dory and put on my horsehide halfmitts , which were to keep the trawl from cutting my palms , by now too tender for the old occupation . I put my gaff handy and brought buoy and anchor in . I began to haul . The first rush of hooks were empty ; a few had the bait on . I slatted the softened baits off against the side and kept passing the line back to Atkins , who stood amidships over an empty tub . He took up the line and coiled it into the tub again . At once , I found that the Hind 's luck had changed . My first fish was a fat cod , as fine a steaker as you could wish for . In my eagerness , I handled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The cod fought off . I struck out with the gaff and nailed him in the eye . I swung it into the dory and shouted : " Luck 's in ! Now for full pens ! " I hauled with care and , at last , got the trawl coming up with such smoothness ( the tide with me ) that I slatted off fish after fish before the dogfish struck in . Like all dorymen , I hated dogfish . They are the curse of the Banks , spoilers of bait and wasters of our sweat . I never could bear just to shake them off and let them live . I kept my knife handy and slashed off nose or tail from each one as it dangled . I killed thirty of them before the run changed and some fine haddock came up . After a few more bare hooks  --  and a big cod eaten to the bone by sea-lice  --  I felt an even harder strain below : the tug of a great halibut . The moment I saw the flat side circling deep in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I let out another whoop . This was answered from the next dory . The exulting cry swept along the line and by this I knew that all the dories were killing fish fast . I gaffed the halibut , hauled it over the gunwale and sent it thrashing down into the mass of cod and haddock piled in bloody water . I then brought five more halibut to the gurdy . It now came Atkins ' turn to haul . I had already slowed up , because a long time had passed since I had put my beef into that work and the strain was telling on me . My cheeks ran with sweat . My arms ached . Yet I was so glad to be killing fish again and piling up dollars for the Hind 's account that I could n't stand Atkins ' clumsiness when he took over . I dropped the coiling trawl and gave him a harsh word for his poor work , which was unfair of me , I know , since the poor creature had n't his heart in it . I drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the time the dory reached the outer buoy , it was full to overflowing . I took in the buoy and hoisted thep187sail . Once under way , I scanned the westward sea . Two other sails had been hoisted , but I again had the start on them and came alongside the Hind first of all , my sail down , my painter ready . I flung the painter up to Nora . She gave it a turn . The cook brought our dory around with a hook and the captain handed down the pitchforks . I had kept the biggest halibut on top . I now drove the tines into it and heaved the fish into the checkers that had been set up to make pens on deck . The moment the fish struck aboard , I shouted : " One for the bank ! " and then : " See your friend ? " Nora put a strain on the painter to keep the dory in . She gave one sour glance at the Doubloon , which was moving off to eastward , and replied : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at this ! " She turned her head toward the load of fish . From that time on , there was no time for anything but fish . There was time to breathe . That 's about all . Dory after dory came up , to one side or the other , and the forks kept the cod flying . I was delighted by the number of halibut , which thousand pounds in the checkers . The dories were back in their nests . Their plugs were out and the pump sent streams of water up to carry off the bloodied water that poured out of the dories . Without a break in the furious rhythm of their labor , the dorymen set up the cutting tables and the keelers to carry off blood and guts and catfish heads . Rippers and gutters took their places . The dressed fish went flying back into big tubs , where the idlers ( of which I was one ) stirred them in the flowing salt water , washed them clean , and forked them on toward the hatch . Just as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lisbon stowed , the cook called the first gang to dinner.  | The Hind was certainly much better off , now that there was something more than bait and ice in her pens . The dorymenwere in a better temper ; because all their hopes for a good stock seemed justified by this rare beginning . Even the presence of the Doubloon failed to put them down , although a dragger is the last thing dorymen like to have around their trawls . The nearness of the vessel left its mark on one man : Captain LeNotre . I took care to keep an eye on him during the dressing of the fish , just to see how he took the turn of luck . With his usual skill at wearing masks , he did his part of the work fairly enough . However , he had fallen , bit by bit , into the listless mood that Parren always seemed to create in him . He came down to dinner with the first gang , as usual . He had hardly taken a mouthful of soup before he muttered some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moody action brought on another , which , in its turn , led directly to a crisis aboard the Hind . Ordinarily , a captain 's moods , and especially his behavior at table , are not open to comment by dorymen , despite the familiarity created by the nature of their work . In the case of LeNotre , this rule had always been followed , the more strictly because the men were n't overly fond of him . This time , the ill feeling among the men broke down the barrier of habit . A doryman seated opposite me put down his spoon and watched the captain 's boots drag up the steps of the companionway . This watchful one was the oldest hand on the vessel and had once been mate on the old Columbia . He commanded respect , and not only because of his grey hairs . When the slide had closed , he looked about in a deliberate manner until he had forced others to look at him . He then spoke in such a way that it was plain to me that he intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did.  |p189He  asked in a loud voice : " What 's the matter with him now ? " Fully aware of trouble ahead , I lightly touched Nora with my elbow and , in order to make things clear , said : " What 's the matter with who ? " The doryman understood this device . He replied : " The captain . Is he off his feed ? " At this , the others stopped eating . The cook paused at the end of the table , a tray aloft . Some of the men bent forward to look at the speaker . Others gazed solemnly into their plates . The speaker went on : " Here we have a couple of pens full , at least , and it puts him off his feed . " So far , his tone might have been taken for one of solicitude for a shipmate . Knowing this and not wanting it , he changed to open insolence . He said : " Maybe he does n't like the smell of fish . " Of course , this amounted to nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doryman 's words were of such a nature that they could have been laughed off easily enough . No one laughed . Consequently , Nora , as owner of the schooner , had the issue set squarely before her . She knew now that many men in the forecastle believed the captain had betrayed them and her by refusing to do his duty . She and I both understood that the story told to us by the Lisbon had been known to others of the crew . All or part , I could n't say . Plainly , the rebel amongst them meant to declare that LeNotre had preventedthem from killing fish before and was likely to do so again . This was a destruction of their livelihood and they wanted to know why . Also this : was he to be kept as captain ? Nora took up the challenge . She said : " Make your meaning clear , Clem . You 're among friends . " " I know that , Cap'n Nora . " He paused and then said : " A short and simple answer from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what you 'll get . Here it is , Miss . Three times in the last two voyages that captain of yours has hauled up and left good fish behind him . We all know it . No man here will deny the truth of what I say . " He waited . No man made a denial . " I do n't know anybody who 's ever been in a dory with him and I do n't know too much about him otherwise . But I do know we could have brought home a hundred thousand pounds last trip . And we did n't ! No ! Instead of that comfort , we lose a good doryman and come home owing the vessel money again . Now what we want to know is : why ? " Nora answered at once . " I know , Clem . And I 'll tell you . " She gave them a smile to divide up amongst them and pushed a tray of halibut steaks toward him . " But there 's no reason why we should n't eat just the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . She said : " What I say can be repeated freely to the other gang and to the men on watch . And should be . Mind that ! " " Except , " said I ( as I had before ) , " to that foul Jonah  --  Billy Atkins . " " Very well . " She then told them all that she knew and feared . She told them ( in the Lisbon 's words ) that Captain LeNotre was Parren 's dog and why it was so . She told them of the hundred thousand dollars offered to her for the Hind by the syndicate at home . She told of her refusal . At this , they murmured and became a little brighter ; because they were learning again the kind of wood out of which she was carved . She told them of all the money owed to Parren and ( to my surprise ) made no bones about declaring that , if the trip failed , he might be able to take the vessel away from her , especially if her grandfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's either Parren or the West Indies . Fifteen thousand dollars ' worth of fish will hold her for a while . Nothingp191else ! I hoped that the Western Star and her keel would turn the trick . She 's gone and that leaves it up to us . " She then spoke of the captain , which was a trial to her . She said : " As to how Captain LeNotre falls so low as to take dirty orders from a dragger captain like Parren  --  and takes whiskey aboard my vessel  --  well ! I 'll leave that part to those amongst you who know the Yarmouth story and some others . It 's not a tale for me to foul my mouth with ! " At this , she gave to the Lisbon a special look which signified that she was leaving that story to him . He nodded . " I 'll tell you this much more , " said Nora . " I came along this time chiefly for the Western Star venture . I really did n't have the money to pay a railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some way . I stayed aboard after we took bait because I figured out something was wrong and I thought it my duty to find out . My duty to you and to the Hind . Well , I 've found out something and I 'm going to find out more ! Let 's keep this in mind : there 's war between us and Parren . Between the Hind and the Doubloon . And our captain  --  Ihate to say it !  --  is n't on our side . Neither is Atkins . Just the same , LeNotre will remain as captain for a time , no matter what you say to me now . I want to keep an eye on him . There 's more to be found out and I ca n't do it if he 's thrown off the vessel . " Clem said : " That will be all right with us . " Nora went on talking . " I want to tell you that I know the times are changing . The Banks are changing . And markets are , too . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If she does , you and I will do the changing together . I know why you stay dory fishing . Why you like it . It 's your life . The old one . That 's why we do n't have to be ashamed of what 's in our pens tonight . We 're not destroying the fisheries . As that fool Parren and others from Boston are . Killing baby fish with drags for the sake of a fillet . The work can be done with a mesh that 'll let the small fish go . Some draggers are ready for them now . They 'll all come to it , just as the English and the Danes have . John here gave up the draggers and the big money and went back into a dory because he would n't destroy what Nature provides for us all . He has his ideas . You know what they are as well as I do . The five-inch mesh he has at home wo n't kill small fish . And it will keep the big ones . Well , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  maybe the Hind will be a smart dragger , after all . I do n't know . I ca n't tell . I have n't the final say in such matters yet . Money talks . " Old Clem said : " This is fair talk , Cap'n Nora , and useful , good talk . All here will stand by with an eye peeled . But what about the fish that are on the feed now ? Do we get them tomorrow or be foxed out of them ? " She cried out : " Get them ! We 'll kill thirty thousand ! " I said : " On the Middle Ground this time of year  --  tide and wind being what they are  --  we 'll be needing a mark-buoy , whether we like it or not . Thereby we 'll not have to take any man 's word as to where the fish are or where the vessel is lying . " " Go tell that to the captain , " said Nora , " and see that it 's done . " She raised her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll tell him myself . " I made way for her and she went down to the cabin alone . The captain had already given the order for the rigging of the mark-buoy . Despite the tragedy which had attended the setting of their last mark-buoy , he had seen that one was required for the Middle Ground tides . When Nora came down into the cabin , he was lying in his bunk , and Atkinsp193was seated on the locker near him , a set of dry-cell batteries in his hands . Either he or LeNotre had picked up a lot of junk at Shelburne for just this purpose . There was a supply of old lifebelts and electric bulbs handy . Both of them greeted her with cheerful faces . She answered by hoping that LeNotre was feeling better . He replied : " The truth of it is , Nora , that when I fast  --  as I did during the blow  --  it takes me some time to get back on my feed . I 'm all right and I 'm obliged to you for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once she wanted to disbelieve all that she had heard of him and all that she feared now . Yet she had struck on a way that might bring her the truth and she was determined to put the matter to its test . She therefore sat down on the locker opposite them and idly stared at Atkins ' clever hands over the gear . She knew he had a good reputation as a rigger of such buoys . It was the only good thing we had ever heard of him . Ile made them in such a way that they stayed upright and did n't sag . They stayed put over the fish , too . She watched him , yet she lifted her eyes , now and then , to trace out the changes in the captain 's face , which was always a puzzle to her and to me . He seemed to be more than usually interested in Atkins ' task , and kept hustling him on with impatientwords . His listless mood had departed . Some inner energy , newly stirred , made his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand through his matted hair ; and , she remembered long afterward , he once laughed aloud for no reason at all . No question but these actions forced back into her memory certain images of their past , images of which I know little , and would like to know less . Anyway , she instinctively let her eyelids fall halfway and , for a time , kept her gaze on her dirty boots . It was the nearness of a once-loved man , and the knowledge that at any moment she might be alone with him , which brought her suddenly to her feet . Captain LeNotre delayed her smoothly . " Stay a while , Nora , please . I 've something to say to you . " He gave to his voice the gentility that often marked his weariness after long , fruitless voyages , a thing I 'd marked in him before , especially when he was telling lies . If Nora had kept her wits about her , she might have seen that this was his old blarney . Nevertheless , it suited her needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before Nora could stand straight , Atkins was scurrying up the steps and LeNotre was at her side , his hands raised . In the moment that the slide closed , he put his arm around her in rough fashion and swung her toward him into a close embrace . From what little I know of this happening ( there being a plain difficulty involved for me ) , I judge that the captain mistook her trembling for something else , which is understandable . He tried hard to kiss her mouth . This she denied to him . She thrust against him in silence with her hands . He did n't let her go . Being forewarned , she perceived that his emotion was a fraud and that he had quite another purpose than the old one of courting her . She then learned , too , the depths of her duplicity ; that she , too , could pretend certain things if it meant an advantage in the defense of the Golden Hind . She lifted her hands to his shoulders and turned her mouth to his . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said at once : " I 'm in trouble , Nora . Awful trouble . " He struck his hand against his mouth . " I 'm the first skipper of this vessel that ever took whiskey aboard her . I lied to you a minute ago about being off my feed . I 'm in trouble . " She backed away from the ring of lamplight in order top195clear the way for her eyes . " What is your trouble ? I know you 're troubled . What is it , Paul ? " " Parren ! " He sent a wild glance toward the dark skylight , as if he could see the glare of the Doubloon 's deck lamps there . " I did n't want to tell you . But  --  well ! I 'm like the Hind herself . Like you . I owe him money . Lots of it . And he 's been putting the gaff on me for it . " " How come you to owe a man like Parren so much ? " She had made a slip there ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of anything but friendliness between her and the dragger captain . He did n't notice that meaning in her words . He replied : " I have n't earned any money aboard this vessel for a long time . You know that too well , Nora . And I needed it . Badly . Badly . " She said : " You 've a reason for saying this to me , Paul . You know I have n't any money . I 'd have given you some if I had any . The vessel owes you plenty . You 'd have gotten it all if the Western Star had worked out . Why do you tell me this ? " He reached for her hands . She gave them to him , knowing well enough why a man believes the male touch can accomplishwonders . He had just such a task set before him ; and , indeed , had good reason to judge that he might succeed . For we are to bear in mind that , up to this moment of their meeting , all that had been said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step might have been explained away , could have been put aside as accidents and ' longshore lies . He had the power to offer her all that a woman could ask : proof of love , proof that he could deliver her from endless toil and fears . He chose to offer the last thing first . He slipped his hand into his jacket and took out a long , white envelope , which had been carefully kept . He pressed it into her hand and said : " Do n't open it yet , Nora . Wait ! "  |p196She  let her hands fall to her side , without even a glance at the envelope . Captain LeNotre then cried out : " Nora ! There 's no beating him ! We can not . " She asked : " No beating who ? " " Parren ! " This took her breath away , made her shudder for the waningof last , fond hopes . She tricked him into giving her time by repeating : " Parren ! " " Aye ! that man ! " He matched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said : " In what way beat him ? Why beat him , Paul ? He 's my friend and my grandfather 's . Tell me , what do your words really mean ? " There 's credit for him in his unwillingness to answer her directly . I ca n't say that I . ever understood his character thoroughly . Good and evil fought too even a battle in that man 's soul . I believe he would have enjoyed faithfulness to a friend or to a lover . I think that it was just such a feeling for Parren , whom he should have cursed , that made him cry out desperately : " Parren wants the Hind ! For his own ! " And : " You owe him too much ! Sell her to him . He gives more than the syndicateoffered . " At this , he seized the envelope and tore it open . He drew out a slip of paper , stared at it , and then held it close to her eyes . She read it : Parren 's draft for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say how the captain came by this draft . By this I mean that it had been made out after our departure from Gloucester and , therefore , had n't been handed over at the hidden meeting aboard the Doubloon . I give the opinion that the two captains had metp197secretly in Yarmouth during the outfitting of the Western Star . ) While she gazed at the fluttering paper , he spoke again , urging her to keep it . He said exactly what the Lisbon had predicted : " Parren ca n't build a vessel for years and he ca n't buy one . They 're all making too much . He 's not sure of stayingon the Doubloon . He 's crazy to get the Hind , Nora . Give it to him . And let 's clear out . " His voice changed to a sweeter , plaintive one , like a small boy pleading . " Let 's clear out . To the West Coast . There 's halibut fishing there , Nora dear . " " No ! " She struck the paper down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " And then , having in mind her need of a deeper look into the mind struggling to overcome hers , she cried out against Parren for big deceit , his pretense of friendship . Perhaps , after all , Captain LeNotre had n't much hope when he began . In any event , he soon gave up and at once changed his tune . At first , he begged her to say that she would , at least , consider selling the vessel at a later time ; and he spoke against me , saying that I had my own plans to capture the vessel . Hereabouts , he became wary of her gaze , which was never an easy thing to bear . Knowing her shrewdness , he hid his desperate eyes from her by turning into the shadow beyond the lamp . There he attacked her with cruel words . He accused her of sending the Hind 's people to the risk of death in winter fishing under sail in order that she might meet the whim of her grandfather and persuade him to deed the vessel over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his say ( and himself ) by : " Worse than that , you killed five good dorymen in that crazy venture with the Western Star . You did n't trust me ! Had you said one word of it to me  --  I 'd have fixed it for you.  | You could have gotten your money right there in Nova Scotia . Yet you told your Bannon . The fanatic ! " She stopped him with a gesture of scorn . " You are calling me the murderer of five good men ! Well enough to say so now . But there may yet be something to say about the Western Star . Those were men on that hulk . " She gave him another portion of her scorn by a stress on the word " men . " " As for keeping the Western Star in Shelburne a moment longer than was necessary  --  why ! you know well that the old fox would have dragged me through every court in the Dominion ! Aye ! and clear to the Admiralty in London . Years ! Years ! Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She struck her hand harshly against her jacket . " I 've got the papers here . And that 's all there is to it . All , do you hear ? I 've lost my friends , the sixteen thousand dollars I hoped to make , and the five hundred I gave that filthy Bannister . But I was right in trying . Right all the time ! " Nora understood by now that her anger had taken her off her course . She got back onto it by saying in a calmer tone : " I stayed below just now because you asked me to . You started to tell me what your trouble is . You give me this news about Parren . I can take it . But the other trouble ? It is n't only debt that Parren holds over your head . Is it ? After all , he ca n't do much to you on that score . Even Parren ca n't get blood out of a stone . What is this other thing ? It drives you to the bottle and makes you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I lay there without sleep . " Ibis response , by eyes and hands flashing in his Miquelon style , was so genuine in its terror that she became convinced that he had , indeed , been led into a frightful difficulty . She became certain that there was truth in the Yarmouth story ; and even believed that there were other matters of life andp199death which held him bound . Thereupon , she put him down forever as a weak , ruined man who could not help being her enemy . She said to herself bitterly : " He will destroy me to save himself . And he can do so ! " Since he again failed to reply in words , she lied to him once more by saying : " I do n't know what the story can be . But tell me this : is that the reason why Dan Corkery hates you and Atkins and Parren ? He cursed you for a murderer when he left the Hind at Gloucester and we thought it was because he laid the death of his brother to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad to say to you . And he knew nothing of the drowning of Corkery 's brother . What 's the meaning of this ? " At the word " Corkery , " LeNotre 's manner became savage . He shut off the blaze as soon as he could . Before he could manage himself , his hand flashed again , this time to his belt and there his shaky fingers flicked against the ivory hilt that lay there . This dirty habit of keeping a killing knife so handy had always frightened her . She shuddered in a new and piercingcold . She waited a little longer , saying good-bye to him in her heart ; and then she left him there , staring at nothing.  |p200I  SAW NO great change in Nora Doonan when she came up . A new loss , which was the greatest of all , had been added to the old . Yet she gave no sign of it . Only I do remember that her face seemed colder than the moon to me ; and the light beneath her lashes had dwindled to ashiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cap to pull it down over her braids , then struck her hands together , and looked away from me . The Hind was jogging near her mark-buoy . The month had taken a bite out of the moon . Nevertheless , it shone so brightly that we had trouble , at times , in making out the buoy . It was one star of many shining low . We stood the watch with much anxiety ; because something was going on out there . She heard our baffled talk and asked the reason for it . The other doryman replied : " It 's that Doubloon . He 's out there , dragging over our fish . Could n't find them for himself , he could n't . " A little earlier , I had caught a Doubloon light directly under the Pole Star ; and tried by this to figure out his speed . I now had my reckoning done . I said : " No ! He 's not dragging . He 's just nosing around . " I lifted my hand . We saw a star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said : " He drags at three knots . He 's making eight or nine . What 's he up to ? He makes me nervous . "  |p201We  watched the Doubloon sail . Her port light twinkled and then faded into a patch of vapor . The watch said : " You 're right , John . He 's bearing on . There ! He 's coming around ! " A red light gleamed beyond ; then the hull went dark . Soon a green light showed . The doryman said to me : " Know something ? " " What ? " " I hate his guts . " " Ah ! not quite that , " said I.We kept that watch for an hour or so . The u atch changed again . Nora and I went below and slept several hours . Toward dawn , the Hind 's horn woke us up . The vapor had thickened and the watch was cranking the horn to keep off passing vessels . The sun scoffed up the vapor for a while . The dories were dropped after breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night . The mark-buoy had served ; so that the Hind now fished where she had such good luck the day before . Because of the danger that the vapor might close in again and cut a dory off , the schooner picked us up after the set was made , so that we could spend our waiting time in the shelter of the vessel . She kept sailing up and down the line of buoys , now and then letting out a blast or two . We ate dinner two hours before noon . Twice during the meal our fog signals were answered by other vessels . One sounded big . The second gang had just finished dinner when a horn called to us close at hand . It was the Doubloon . She fooled around beyond the hedge a bit , as if she was n't quite sure of herself ; then she came right up and her bow-watch hailed the Hind . The dragger slowed down . She stood there , vague in the mist . A flurry of snow slid over her house and darkened up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered the hail , I heard some loud talk on the Doubloon . Her engine idled and she came closer . Parren himself spoke up . " That the Golden Hind there ? " " Aye ! ' t is she ! " I said to a doryman : " Tell the captain the Doubloon is talking to us . " Captain LeNotre came on deck . He shouted : " You the Doubloon ? " " Right you are the first time ! Thought I 'd never find you . " We could hear Parren 's laughter . " How you making out , Captain ? " LeNotre gave the customary and wary answer that there was n't a fish to be had for love or money . " Killed a few here yesterday and marked them . " The sun and wind suddenly cleared up that space . I could now see Parren plain . He filled up the door of his pilothouse . He wore half a beard . He scraped something off his chin and shouted again . " That your mark-buoy I saw last night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 've made a set here just now . Mind you , do n't drag over our trawls ! " " What an idea ! " Parren showed his teeth in a grin . " I 'll clear out . You still got your company aboard , Captain ? " " I have . " At the time ( and even now ) , I could see nothing in this exchange that might be of a secret nature ; that is , unless the two had agreed on some second meaning for innocent words . Nevertheless , some sort of intelligence  --  private , I mean  --  passed between them . It seemed , at a time considerably after the event , that Parren may have expected good news from his follower . Not getting it then and there , he surely understood that he had lost standing . I know this much for sure : he gave up his pretense of friendship . His next words gave me the hint.  |p203He  said : " You 'll want the news . Market cod is sixteen cents . Large is eighteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Four hundred thousand pounds yesterday . And your company 's kin at home ai n't doing so well . So the Gloucester station says . " He laughed once more and closed the door . The engine speeded up . The Doubloon steered westwardand vanished into a new spread of vapor . Her horn began wailing out there . None of us considered this talk much of a kindness from Parren . He usually spent a good deal of his time listening to the Doubloon 's radio , now that the Navy had allowed their use . He bored his men to nervousness by trying to repeat the nonsense that the prophets dished up every day . And , as one of the men said , he was such a born liar that it might n't be true about Grandfather Doonan being in poor shape . However , that was something not to be helped . Nora said nothing at all . That same vapor now rolled in over the Hind . It was so thick that a double watch was set in the bow . More flurries of snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little . Such conditions were always hard to bear . The news of steady prices at Boston did n't make waiting any easier . The Lisbon held his temper , as usual , and made light of the choppy sea ; said it would n't come to anything . Just the same , he kept a sharp watch for the trawl buoys . When one rolled by , he brightened up considerably . This particular action began to get on the captain 's nerves . I saw this and I said to myself : " Why should it ? He 's going balmy on us ! " At last , he shouted to the Lisbon : " What in hell you fidgetingaround for ? Do n't you think I know where my trawls are lying ? "  | He did n't wait for an answer . He went below and stayed there , after leaving word that he should be called if the weather cleared . The Lisbon stared after him . He made no reply , of course . He did n't have enough respect for LeNotre to enter into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or actions escaped the Lisbon . One thing could be said of this man : he never missed a trick . There were men aboard that vessel who might be misled by a lie or a gesture . Nobody could fool the Lisbon for long . A falter in a sentence , or an eye turned away too soon , was enough to sharpen him . His affection for Nora and her grandfather made him even keener now . He made it clear that he had snuffed up a taint . He said to the men near him : " Me  --  I 'd put dories over now and haul . That 's what I 'd do ! " He spoke loud enough so all the men  --  and there were twenty or so on deck  --  could hear him . Their very presence at such a time of day showed that their rebellious mood had n't waned much . I understood why they had gathered near the helm . They were , in a way , helpless ; for we actually did n't know where our trawls were lying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their own . However , in such thick weather , the captain was the only man who would know exactly where the set had been made . It was his part to keep that account in his mind , to add up the miles of jogging , to take away the turns and returns along the line of buoys . He was the man who should have been standing there , ready to point into the vapor and say : " Number One Dory is there ! " Other men were expected to take a kink at such idle times in order to store up strength for the labor of hauling . Even I , although acting as first officer , could n't be expected to watch sailing so closely . These were circumstances that Nora Doonan had neverp205heard of , despite all her experience and all the dory talk she had taken in . She was baffled . She kept her silence and watched us stamp up and down to beat off the chill . Often she saw the men put their heads together and say things that brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her need to say something , she asked me : " Has it cleared at all , John ? " " No ! " At this , old Clem turned from the rail . He said : " It 'll grow no worse . We can haul all right . We 've hauled in worse than this . And for him , too . He 's drowned men  --  he has  --  in a sea worse than this . " He angrily asked me : " You know where them buoys lie ? " I hesitated . Nora saw me falter . She repeated his question . " Do you know , John ? " I flung out my hand . " Number Four lies there ! " All their heads changed to follow . Somebody said : " That 's what I thought , Johnnie . " Another : " That 's about it . Four or Five 's there . " During this hour , which was later than noon , the Hind was sailing back to the beginning of the set . It was n't long before she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She sailed on that course until she came around again for the trip up the line . The tail-end of a squall slapped her . In moving off , the squall breached the thickness beyond . It was another of those remarkable changes that make the Middle Ground a strange place to fish . You might have thought that one powerfulray had been set to work on the mist ; because the sun swept after the squall , carved open the upper thickness , and burned a path into the southwest . Flashes of light spun off a black sea there . I said to the watch : " Will the captain come up ? "  | Without a word , he turned away and went to the companionway . The slide was open . He thrust his head down , again without speaking . He swung away and shot a word to the helmsman . This was done with a derisive gesture of his hand downward ; that is , toward the cabin where LeNotre stayed . He then came back to the rail and said to me : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way of signifying that there was something not quite right about the captain . Something new . I said to myself : " Sucking the bottle again . He 's on the merry-go-round . " No doubt about it ; and full reason he had . A man forward shouted : " Number One Buoy ! " Before I turned my eyes down , I looked deeper into the opening in the vapor . I saw the Doubloon at the far end . Without giving much thought to it , I marked that two of her men were on her pilot-house . They were working on a dory that she carried as a lifeboat . They were either getting ready to put it over or had just hauled up . The same man let out a startling cry . " Hey ! " Others near me set up a cry . Loudest of all , I heard the Lisbon 's voice , uttering some Portuguese phrase in a piercing tone . I could n't catch the words . Hands went up in gestures of dismay and anger . Out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is ! It is ! Do n't tell me , chum ! " He struck at my arm furiously . " Your own buoy , Johnnie ! Running free ! " I gave the buoy one glance and turned from the rail . I shouted : " Atkins ! Atkins ! " A doryman pushed him toward me . Ile half-stumbled . I brought him up with my hand . I meant him no harm . His expression was horrified . His eyes fixed me with a fear that plainly told he expected a blow that would kill him . I shouted : " To the dory ! Over with it ! " He gasped , then ran smartly forward.  |p207To  myself I said : " To the devil with that captain ! " and then aloud : " Dories away ! All ! All ! Get them over ! " To Nora I said : " Take the helm until cook gets up ! " I shook her roughly because she seemed on the point of imploring me for some word . She was n't the one to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " What 's wrong , John ? What 's happened now ? " I had no time for her . I struck her hand away roughly . " You 'll find out soon enough , my girl . Get that man to his dory ! " She ran to the wheel . The helmsman stepped away , shoutinghis question : " What say ? What say , Jack ? " Nora put her hands on the spokes and cried out : " Call the captain ! Go to your dory ! " The helmsman pushed back the slide and sent the alarm down . In his furious words , which rang fore and aft , he summed up his knowledge that a new disaster had befallen the Hind and his belief that the captain was the source of it . He did n't use the word " captain . " He shouted : " LeNotre . Tumbleup , you ! Lively now ! " The men at the tackle dropped off my dory . Crouched in the bow with my gaff in hand , I bade Atkins put his beef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space of clear water and bore down on the buoy . The buoy was acting in an odd way . Its blackball dipped into the sea . The buoy itself whirled freely and tipped . I knew what the story must be , even before I actually saw it . I struck at the buoy with my gaff , brought it up and lunged to seize it . I swung the keg out of the water and held it clear , so that the water from it dripped upon my face . Silent now , I held it aloft , held it in a solemn pose because the buoy had become to me a symbol of all the hard luck and evil that followed the Golden Hind . The trawl line had been cut . It had n't merely parted . Had n't chafed and worn away . It had been cut . " Cut ! " I tossed the word onto the wind ; and the wind blew it back to me , blew it into my mouth again and it knocked me down over that black keg . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hey ? " I let the buoy fall and stared at the severed line . I fumbled at the yarn where the knife in an enemy 's hand had sliced deftly through . " Cut ! " I said . " Hey ? " cried Atkins over his shoulder . " What 's that you say ? " I looked at him and then I looked away . The vapor had drifted off . The sea lay clear . I saw the Hind sailing up the line . The last dories were dropping off . Soon the clamor of conch horns blew over the water . Horns weeping and raging and cursing . Men 's voices mingled with the accents of the horns ; and these voices sang out the end of the Hind . By these complaining horns and the cries of the dorymen , I knew that every trawl had been cut , that the last of our gear had been ripped from her . All her miles of trawl were gone , all the thousands of Norway hooks , all our hopeful labor . I heard the Lisbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clem 's horn , each telling the same tale . I reached for my own conch and blew into it , cupping it in my hands . I filled my cheeks and blew clamorous , grieving notes to tell them that my story was like their own . It was in vain to try for a rescue . The job had been done thoroughly . By now , the current had washed the trawls far to the southward , where the Doubloon lay ; and the fish that had taken our baits drifted away to useless death . Yet , for the sake of the Golden Hind and the unfortunate girl at her helm ,  |p209I  turned to my dorymate and said : " You bloody Jonah ! row ! Let me see your sweat ! If you 've such a decent thing in you . " I found the outer buoy . It , too , had been severed from the trawl and from its anchor . I drew it into the dory and sat down . Atkins rowed back into the path of the schooner . Soon the Hind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the line , picking the dories out of the stream as she came . I stood amongst my shipmates again . I gave one look at Nora Noonan and turned away . No man spoke . There was no need of words . They knew well enough that there was scarcely a full tub of new trawl left on the schooner , and little of the old . They knew , too , the burden of debt that Nora had undertaken to fit out for this last voyage . Yes , it was the Hind 's last . All aboard knew it . It was left for the Lisbon to make the gesture of surrender , the signal that our hardy struggle had come to its end , that we could all go below now and sleep , while the Hind sailed home to Gloucester , never to come out again as her own self . In his right hand the Lisbon held his gaff , a stout one he had made many years before at his own forge . The barb gleamed in the evening light . His rusty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow and much-scarred . There was no counting the cod it had struck , the halibut hauled from the green . Nor the dollars earned and mouths fed . No other thing could be a better symbol of the pitiless conflict between the new and the old , between the men who killed fish with hooks and the men who swept them into cod-ends . The Lisbon raised the gaff high above his head . He sent his eyes a-roving among our people . To each pair of eyes , as his encountered them , he gave a glance of pity . To Nora , gazing at him while she swayed to the Hind 's going , he gave a look of tenderness , mixed with his despair . It was only when his eyes met Atkins ' stare that their light changed . And when he looked at Captain LeNotre , sagging half-drunk by the wheel , all tenderness and despair vanished before his anger . His lips moved in a Portuguese phrase . Curse or prayer , I could n't tell which . He jerked his arm . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a pool of foam.  |p211THE  Doubloon came on . She sailed at dragging speed , her towing wires cutting the water on this side of her slight wake . At that distance , I could scarcely make out her crew of eight or nine . All of them were on deck , except the old hand off the Hind , Daniel Corkery . Two men were standing at the starboardgallows . Two others were at the winch , ready to release the brakes and throw in the clutch when the dragging was finished . The wire-steerers , crowbars in hand , stood by the ' midship gear to guide the heavy cables onto the drums in even windings . Soon the men in her pilot-house could be made out dimly behind the panes . They steered straight toward us , and made a handsome sight . Yet , despite her glitter and spankiness and the twilight glow in which she brightly moved , that vessel threw a long shadow before her , a shadow to be seen by men 's hearts . There was no good in her , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aboard the Hind who did n't know that the blow against them had been struck by the men who now came up . No word was uttered on the Hind 's deck , even when Parren himself came out of his house and lifted his glasses to look at us . I stirred uneasily in my place . I could feel the impact of those changed eyes , could imagine the thoughts that must now be rolling through that mind . He had accomplished all that he had set out to do ; and had done it in so cruel and cunning a manner that he could escape all punishment . Only once in my life had I ever heard of a raid against a schooner 's trawls ; and that had been long , long ago in my grandfather 's youth . A feud between brother and brother , the Barbers of evil memory . Captain Parren 's face became clear . He hung his glasses up . I hated that face ; hated , even more , the thought of seeing triumph shine on it . I looked among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Atkins whispering , LeNotre trying to listen . The dorymen had now drawn away from the Jonah . It was hard to say what our people were waiting for . Surely they were full of spleen and their hearts wild for the want of something to curse to hell and back again . Every man there , clinging to the rail or to the standing gear , had a new life and a doubtful one before him now . The elders would be on the beach for good ; companions to the unwanted . Others must find a strange row to hoe . All had lost their sea-home ; a few had lost their only one , there being some men aboard who had n't slept off the Hind for years . Had they all burst into moans , I would n't have wondered greatly . Yet there they stood like men of bronze or yellow brass . So she stood in her yellow oil clothing , her long legs straddled , her hands clasped behind her back , her eyes glowering . No need to ponder on her thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stir us . Captain Parren came down from the pilot-house step and stood at the rail . He raised a hand to his mouth and brayed across the water : " How things going , boys ? " His men laughed . One clanked his steering-bar . Without facing his Boston rogues , Parren jovially chided them out of 13the corner of his mouth . To us he again cried : " You boys lost anything ? Your tongues maybe ? " He roared at this sally and beat both hands gaily against his slicker . The Doubloon surged a length nearer . I could now take note of the slightest changes in their expressions . There was nothing much to hope for there . Birds of a feather flock togetherand go together to sea . One face among them turned to us with a compassionate look . This was Dan Corkery , the doryman who had once cursed LeNotre solemnly and had made an oath of revenge . Corkery had been sewing on the Doubloon 's starboard net , laid in thick folds along the rail for use when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if he knew what shame his old shipmates had to undergo . I was shocked by the change that had come over him since the day ( not far gone ) when , grieving for his lost brother , he had stepped off our own vessel and had boarded her enemy 's . He was even gaunter . His cheeks had been thin before . Now they were drawn in . Since he had n't shaved in that time , he seemed more like a mad creature than ever . Only his eyes showed real life . They burned in sockets the color of coal . Captain Parren was n't done with us . " Catfish took your tongue , Cap'n Nora ? " He made this inquiry in a lively , boyish tone , surprising from such jowls . Nora Doonan was n't man enough to take this . She spat . Her action delighted Parren . He whispered an aside and , without really breaking off his attention , looked down at his towing wires . They were taut again . The cod-end had taken all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helmsman . The horn blew . Her bow swung sharply toward the Hind . The men at the brakes pushed , the winch howled and began to grind the cables in . The dragger leaned a little toward the net , which was rising heavily.  | Parren now singled out Billy Atkins . He ignored our captain , pretended he did n't even see him . He said : " How you , Billy ? Billy boy , you talked yourself back into a dory , did n't you ? You sorry now , chum ? " Atkins wanted to break the silence of the Hind . He looked slyly about , wet his lips , opened them a little , and then thought better of it . This amused Parren . He said in mock aggrievement : " Why , Billy , do n't you like us any more ? You lose something , too , Billy ? " He put his hands together on his front and let his belly shake heartily . " Billy , ca n't you teach those greenhorns how to fish ? Better bring them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some real money . " His men standing forward , ready to take up the doors of the drag , which were emerging , laughed and beat their icy mitts together . Parren glanced at them . " Or better still , " he shouted , " maybe we could fix the old Hind up a bit and all go aboard her , eh ? " At this hint of her fate , his manner changed abruptly to a black one . He spat over his rail . The doors crashed into the gallows . The space of water between the vessels flattened , grew dark , and began to bubble , as if some monster were rising from the slime . The winch squealed and stopped . A vast stirring took place . This underseaworking caught all eyes . The men of the Doubloon put on hungry stares . So did Parren . He chewed at his lips . Our people watched in silence . Atkins even dared , in the growing excitement , to move nearer to the rail . Laced bubbles swam up in circles and burst into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's net sprang loudly out of the sea , a vast hump . Bigger than a bull whale , and wallowing like one , the cod-end came heaving up . Rosy brooks flowed off it . Amidst cries of gulls and a rustling of crushed fins , the bag burst into thep215twilight . Bound in the long curves of its mesh , thousands of fish , great and small , struggled in a gleaming mass . Blood and foam and guts oozed out of the narrow mesh . Green and beautiful , a shark writhed against the twine , his ivory belly gleaming brightest of all . Hundreds of young cod , too small to take a baited hook , had been swept up in the mesh and now fought , with gasping mouths , to work their way out . A curioussqueaking noise , rather kittenish in character , came out of the slaughter . This was a familiar sound to me : the bursting of bladders . The Doubloon men roared with joy for an easy harvest and a big one . They had earned as much in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard sailing . They had done little for it , except to sew up rips and heave the net over . They cheered themselves nobly and bellowed fresh insults to our people , saying : " How you like it , dorymen ? " and worse . The Hind 's people gave no answer . Half-sprawled over the rail , I kept my mouth shut , too , and closely watched the slaughter of baby fish that took place before my eyes . It was a matter of great meaning to me ; that is , I was a student of such matters . I was , after a fashion , still in the employ of scientists who had the fisheries close to heart . I stayed cold enough , yet I hated that dragger as much as ever I hated anything . The bag heaved higher . Sharks came slanting up out of the green to feed nimbly on fish that twisted out of the mesh . Gulls came down ; then rose shrieking at the sight of sharks ' bellies flashing white as they curled to bite and swallow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A good-sized halibut came up out of the water when the bag heaved . The fish lay on the outside of the mesh . I had hardly taken note of this when the cod-end rolled higher and many other fish  --  halibut and cod  --  came into sight , lashing their tails and struggling . I shouted : " The trawls ! " My chums made the discovery before I had the word well out . They cried out : " Our gear ! " and raised their fists and voices against the Doubloon . For the Doubloon 's net , now fully up , bore an extraordinary outer burden . This burden was the Hind 's own gear and the Hind 's own harvest . Strung along the edges of the mound , three or four trawls lay tangled and twisted . It was clear to me what had happened . The codend , dragging along the bottom , had struck the drifting trawls ; and bare hooks had caught in the mesh . Haddock and cod and catfish by the hundreds lay in the long , looped vines of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doonan shouted : " The dories ! Take the gear away from him ! " The men turned , stared at her , then ran forward in a stumblingrush . It was no use . Captain Parren laughed louder than ever . He leaned backward against the pilot-house and let his head roll in laughter . He swung his hand in a signal . The winch started and the bag , bearing both harvests , began swimming slowly toward the Doubloon 's hoisting gear . Parren made a trumpet of his hands and shouted : " Hey ! you boys lose something in the vapor ? " His " ha ! ha ! " drove us into a frenzy ; and brought about one of those petty accidentsthat can drive a mass of men into violent action . Old Clem , turning in despair from the dory-nests , ran full tilt into Billy Atkins . This touching of the Jonah set the old man afire . He clapped both hands on Atkins ' shoulders and stared into his face . I 've no doubt that Clem meant nothing more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow ; for he knew Atkins '  |p217|part  in earlier events . A second doryman , seeing this , laid hands on Atkins . Thus , for me , a queer tableau to remember long . Such it seemed , because nothing moved . No hand . Nothing . Only the seamed faces stared under brims at the draggerman ; and he , so quickly taken , had no time to change his look . ' T was empty of fear and of surprise . Yet , before one could speak to another by voice and say : " Do this ! " their hearts spoke and they lifted him clear . They staggered aft a step or two away from the fore rigging and , with a loud cry , hurled him into the water . Atkins screamed in his headlong flight . He screamed again when he struck the sea . He vanished in a welter , rose striking to the top , and , impelled by his terror of icy drowning , flailed with both his hands . He was no swimmer . Nevertheless , he pushed along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first grasp closed on a fish head , which broke off . Ile tried again . This time his fingers hooked the mesh . He began to struggle up the mound of writhing cod . His knees sank deep . He lay there for a moment and held his head clear to suck in air . He climbed again , digging his boot-heels into the bulge . The Hind 's men shouted curses after him and threats , saying that they 'd rip and gut him for a Jonah if ever they laid hands on him . The draggermen returned both curses and threats . They urged Atkins on . " Hang on , Billy ! Take it easy , old-timer ! " Parren , raging up and down his deck , shouted to the winchmen . They braked the cable . The bag rode slower , rose higher . Atkins was safe . Stretched out on the hump , hardly daring to move lest he slip down , he lifted his head and spewed forth a good portion of the vile stuff that was in it . He gave Nora a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dorymen , he laid out an astonishing variety of curses . He had travelled con/siderably in his time . And certain of his jumbled words gave us reason to believe that he had known beforehand of the raids against our trawls . They took him aboard the Doubloon ; and tenderly patted his shoulders , looked at his hands . And in silence they hauled the bag up to the rail and made ready to hoist it inboard . It was so big that they had to split it with a rope ; that is , take half over at a time . Other men unravelled the Hind 's trawls . They slatted off all our fine fish and flung them into the pile that now poured out of the net , hoisted high in the gallows.  |p219THE  Doubloon turned on her deck lamps for the dressing of fish . She drifted on the tide . So did the Golden Hind . It seemed strange to me that Parren did n't put his net over . When I spoke of this to Nora and the Lisbon , they said that Parren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was puzzling to think about , especially LeNotre 's curious position aboard the schooner . I could see that Parren might judge our captain to be an ally of dubious worth . Nora said : " Parren wo n't leave us be . Mark my words ! Nor am I through with him yet . " There was no wind . The sea became a flat . I could see no reason why the Hind should n't go home when there was wind enough . There was nothing for her to do . I had overhauled the fishing gear . Even with every odd and end scraped together , there was n't much that could be rigged . I gave this opinion to her . She listened to it , then replied harshly : " No ! Wind or not , I 'll watch this tramp a while . I 've my own ideas . " " You 're entitled to them , " said I. " But what are they ? " She gave me a short answer ; something to the effect that when she was ready she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Tell the men to break out every torch we have . Light them if the Doubloon puts her lights out . "  | The Lisbon went about this business . The Hind carried the old-fashioned kerosene torches , which were long handles with reservoirs of oil to supply cloth wicks . These were used for baiting up before dawn and for dressing fish after nightfall . I should have been pleased to know why she was calling for them at this time . However , I had enough of short answers for the day . The first gang went down to supper . Captain LeNotre kept to his bunk . He was either far gone in drink or pretending so . He made no response to the few words that had to be said to him by the watch . Nor did he take notice when we came down and turned in . She fell into an uneasy sleep , raided by dreams of her failures and her uncertain fate . I watched her lying there . Once I heard her speak out of her dreams . ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A little later , she got out of her bunk and turned the lamp wick down to dull its glare . The cabin was hard to breathe in . She closed the stove draft and opened the companionway slide an inch to freshen the air . She closed her eyes again and , at last , fell into a sounder sleep . I also slept . A while later , a hand reached into my own dreams . I awoke . The watch was standing by my bunk . He had already awakenedNora , who was pulling on her boots and talking to herself . " What s the story ? " I rolled out and he handed me a boot . He jerked his hand toward the captain 's bunk . Not long before , LeNotre had been lying there , dead to the world . When I now looked , I saw that the bunk was empty . I asked : " Where is he ? " The watch replied : " He came on deck and said he was going into the galley for a mug-up . Said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go forward and below . The next thing Ip221knew he was sneaking aft again . He did n't take a mug-up , Miss Nora . He went to lee side and got to work on a dory . And that 's where he is now . Trying to get it over . " " Is he drunk ? " " No , John . Sober as a judge . " We followed him to the deck . I said to the watch : " See if he 's off the vessel . Do n't lay hands on him . " I had a certain knife in mind . The watch returned and , in considerable excitement , reported that LeNotre had put the dory over and was rowing away from both vessels ; that is , to the northward . We all went forward . At first , nothing could he made out . Soon I caught the gleam of an oar ; a moment later , the dory showed up , slowly passing away from the Hind . This certainlywas a frightening action on the captain 's part . Often enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two occasions , he had been guilty of such deeds of temper that more than one man had declared him fit for the looney-bin . He had the name of a man able to hold his liquor . Just the same , he had n't carried his load that day with much success . The doryman said out of the sour corner of his mouth : " He 'll wind up in Fortune Bay . At that rate . Or inside an icicle . Well , good riddance to bad rubbish ! Better off without him . " " It 's not as easy as that , chum , " I said . Nora hauled herself into the swifters . A wash of light out of the moon gave us then a new glimpse of the dory . We saw the blond head turn to look ahead ; and the oars strike in good style . " Bad as he is , " she said , " we ca n't let him do that . " " I can ! " The doryman showed his bitterness . But not his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the story . " She asked : " Then what is it ? What 's he up to now ? " I did n't like the sound of her " now " ; it had that tonelessnesswhich was part of her when she was actually taken up with a hard piece of thinking . " Wait a while . " I said this and stood back . The dory had vanished . I crossed to the windward rail , where I could see the Doubloon . Her deck lamps were blazing . She had made a short and circling drag and now lay about as before , not much farther than a cable length . I set my eyes on the farther rim of the glow in which she lay . I saw LeNotre 's dory pass beyond the Doubloon 's bow and run in . The Doublooncame between me and LeNotre . Soon after I made sure that it was his yellow hair I saw . It was touched by a frosty dew . I noted the stir caused on the Doubloon by his arrival . Two men left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other gave him a hand . LeNotre fell awkwardly over the rail and crossed to the pilot-house . Its door opened . A man at the washing-tubs also went to the pilot-house . I added up the sum , which gave the following : Atkins and Parren and LeNotrewere together again ; and urgent need had called them . I took a while more for my thinking . It was certain that the hope of gain drew the thieves together . I could n't figure out what that gain might be . Slow work on my part , as you will see . No question but the gain would be the Hind 's loss . Yet , what had she to lose ? What else was there for the Hind to give over ? Nothing ! I made up the opinion that LeNotre and Atkins wished to tell Parren about the loss of the Western Star . He would find satisfaction in the news , just as they had been satisfied when the hulk drove by . This was n't the whole pattern . Something was missing from the picture.  |p223I  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's gone aboard the Doubloon . I saw him plain . " " Ah , John ! " " That 's the story . He 's in her pilot-house this minute . " This made the watch jumpy . I said to him : " Best for you to turn out a few more men . Keep a double watch forward and aft . Do n't let anybody come aboard this vessel . Not even the captain , unless he comes alone . " The watch went below . Nora said : " What 's your thinking been like ? " " I 'm up a tree . " " What more can they do to us ? " Her plaintiveness stirred me . I touched her hand and answered : " That 's exactly what I was just asking myself . What have they got to talk about ? There 's a pattern in it . But I ca n't work it out . " I paused and then added deliberately : " Not from here , I ca n't . " She took up the hint and added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's still got our Dan Corkery . " I said to myself : " Why beat about the bush ? " Aloud : " That 's so . Yet it 's to be kept in mind that Dan Corkery cursed LeNotre and would n't go on the Hind with him . " This was no obstacle at all to the action she had in mind . It was n't meant to be . All I wanted was for her to agree and keep her short answers to herself . " Just the same , " she said , " things change . Men change . Maybe Dan Corkery has . He went onto the Doubloon becauseParren lent us Atkins . Now Corkery 's a hated man aboard her . More than ever  --  now that those two are there . He 's got something on them all . Yes ! I 'm sure of one thing and it 's this : if they had a chance  --  they 'd get rid of him ! Kill him , if they could frame a likely accident . " I heard herP224take a sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen and heard , it was a pain for her to speak a thought like that . Naturally , it was . She stuck to it and added : " There 's more reason for such a fear now . Because Corkery knows all they 've done to us today . And before today . " I struck my hands together . " I tell you , I 'd like to get aboard that Doubloon for a few minutes . I 'm going to knock Parren 's head off when I meet him , anyway , and I would n't mind busting him up right before his men . " This seemed like a leaf out of the boaster 's book . Well , I know dog Brag nobody likes him ; and I 'd have piped a gentler tune if it was dorymen I meant to face . The fact is that I knew every man aboard the dragger ; and there was n't one who could stand up to it for five minutes . She said nothing against my notion ; and for a good reason , shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said was : " His men ! There 's a trouble for you , Captain ! " " Crowd of pick-up bums . They 'd think twice before they looked my way . " " Ah ! " She came an inch or two nearer and gave me her shrewd look , as if she knew of more than one possible reason for my words , and wished to size me up . " Just the same , it 'll do no harm to hold a hard hand over them . Wait here . " I knew what man she had in mind . Little I cared for him . She went down into the cabin by herself and pulled out a drawer built into the locker under the captain 's bunk . Several old charts were there and , under them , a brass-bound box , its key in the lock . She opened it . An old revolver lay there , shining on a fold of cloth . She had n't seen it for a long time . It had never been used . Her father used to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She put it into her pocket and cameP225up . Clem and the Lisbon had been turned out . They had swung over a dory . She showed the revolver to me . " You take this . " I answered : " I 'll have nothing to do with such truck ! " I went to the rail and said : " Clem and Terry will put me aboard her and stand by . I 'll go into her port gear and they 'll never be the wiser . Until I show myself to take Corkery off . He 'll come with me , Dan will . " I jumped to the rail . She held up her hand to me ; and it seemed to me that she wished to make it a friendly grasp . When my hand closed on her fingers , she gripped hard and pulled herself up . The men murmured against her intention . I was n't even surprised . She had some curious way of getting a man ready to accept her decisions . I ca n't tell how . Well , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dory gunwale and said : " Let her drop , Clem . It 's my business that 's being done and I 'll be on hand . Or it wo n't be done at all . I know more of this than all of you put together . Besides , I 'm a smoother worker than this lad here . Him and his fists ! " She settled on the thwart and there cried out : " And whether you like it or not , I 'm going to ask Parren for something ! " " For what ? " " My trawls . The dog 's got four of them . Maybe five . We 've the makings of another tub . Perhaps more . We 've all our bait left . Well , why not ? Rig for halibut and take a chance . " " For halibut ? " Old Clem looked down at her in astonishment . His reason : there had n't been a good stock of halibut taken to Gloucester since the Laura went away . And she killed hers on the Grand Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my opinion .   " Aye ! Where Ambrose last killed them . On Misaine . Now , let 's go ! And say no more about my not going ! " The dory went down . I knocked the strap away after Clem and the Lisbon had secured the tackle and joined us . We rowed away in the darkness and made a wide sweep of it so that the dory glided up to the Doubloon 's weather rail withoutbeing seen . The lee net was coming in and no man on the Doubloon had eyes for anything else . I crawled over the rail and took shelter in the idle net . Its long folds hid me , but I could see the Doubloon 's men clearly through the mesh . I was not uneasy . I saw Atkins at work by the main hatch , a pitchfork in his hands , his back turned to me . Dan Corkery stood a jump away from Atkins . The first thing that struck me hard , there in the glare of deck lamps , was the expression on Corkery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nightmare . He was alive , yet not alive . Parren and LeNotre were in the pilot-house . I could just make them out in the half-light there . The last bag had been dressed and put down . Now the new set came up . The horn blew , the winch rolled . The net came up and swam gushing to the side . The gallows-men reached out to sway it over . It seemed a good set , although smaller than the one I 'd watched from the Hind . The men brought it inboard , shouting their signals to the winch . One of them crept under the bulging cod-end to pull the slip-rope . He jerked hard and sprang away . The mottled bullskin ( Holstein , I guess ) of the cod-end burst open ; the avalanche of fish poured upon the deck . I groaned in the old anger . My word for it ! there were fifty thousand fish in that spreading pile . If not more . And they were all baby cod . I could n't count a score of goodsizedfish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halibutP227that had been feeding on the school , and the usual shark , thrashing with a young cod nabbed in his jaws . Most of the young fish were dead already , crushed by the weight of the catch and the cod-end 's great pressure . It was plain that Parren had been deliberately raiding the nursery ground . Yet even he had n't bargained for a haul like that . The fish were too small for any use . Had they been left to grow a year , they 'd have doubled in size and left billions more in spawn behind them . Now they were squandered . I myself had once killed like that by accident on George 's . It had made me sick ; and the old sickness now tormented my belly . I heard , above the noises of dying fish and sea , a roar of anger from the pilot-house . A bullish burst that sounded clear above the clatter of gear and oaths from the draggermen . Parren swung down the step and went into his act . He cursed the fish and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and aimed a blow at Atkins , who deftly stepped away from it with a yell and a curse that astonished me . A madhouse . Captain Parren then ordered the men to open the big scuppers . Through these , the dead and dying fish were broomed and forked . This was n't fast enough for him . Ile picked up the hose and , still damning what he called his luck , he turned the stream onto the fish . Soon the deck was clear and the bag went down again . Atkins had some shame left in him . Why it could be , I ca n't imagine . The blow and abuse left him in a queer , yammering condition . Hysterical is the word . Like his master , he had to take it out on an unfortunate . This was our Corkery . The doryman had slipped on the fish scales and muck while they were pushing the net back over the rail . Atkins may have become excited , in a murderous sort of way , by the physi/cal position that Corkery was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he had been struck down . He lay almost on his back , trying to get a purchase with his boot . He was like that when Atkins screeched some words at him . I do n't know what they were . No doubt of their badness . They must have been like barbs , especially to a man who had been taking a lot of abuse aboard that vessel . I saw Corkery twist his head toward Atkins and I could easily tell , by its fierceness ( the teeth being bared and the eyes glaring ) that he was n't going to take any more of it . Corkery uttered one word in reply . I could n't hear it becauseof the clattering of the cables grinding forward to the gallows . Yet the shape of his mouth told me the word . It was the old one : " Murderer ! " That poor man was obsessed with that awful word , as his heart had been beset by the act . I did hear Atkins ' answer . He repeated Corkery 's word in a high-pitched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this much more : " You pick-up dory bum ! Murdered your own brother to save your skin ! " Corkery heaved himself to his feet . He had n't taken his eyes off Atkins in that rising . His face had now become the face of a man who intends to kill another . Having seen this twice in my life , I 'd better not try to say what it 's like . His stare was so fierce that Atkins raised his pitchfork and cried out over it , either in warning or in horror . I could never tell afterwardswhether Atkins really meant to attack Corkery . It made no difference . The sea and his unset thighs settled the matter . More than once , as the work had gone on , the men near the rail had shouted against freakish seas that rolled out of the dark and came in over the rail . No harm in them if you knew they were coming . Now , at this moment of Atkins ' dangerous poise , such a roller hit the Doubloon . It shook the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of him . On his face , I saw a look of surprise . An odd thing to say , but it 's true . He seemed annoyed at finding himselfunder way . My unwise and useless impulse to run between the two men was beaten down by a stronger instinct : to save myself from the boarding sea . It could drown me fast enough . I reached for a stay and clung to it . I bent backward to shout to Nora and her dorymen . The sea buried the deck and struck against my hips . In leaning sideways , my head turned again , and my glance took in the pilot-house . I saw Captain LeNotre and Captain Parren staring through the same pane . Jaw to jaw , they were ; their eyes were fixed on Atkins and Corkery . Such a small measure of time had passed that Atkins ' charge had hardly gone forward a stride . He was committed to it . He kicked out his right leg to try for balance . I Ic lost and fell onward , thrusting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no time to stand aside . I-le could n't avoid the blow . He bent his head back and flung up his hands in an awkward , fending motion . A tine pierced the palm of his left hand . He screamed . He then fought for his life . IIe pressed the pierced hand upward and thus saved his heart from a mortal stab . He closed the pierced hand on the fork and jerked Atkins toward him . Atkins had to yield . The violence of his plunge carried him into Corkery 's grasp . Atkins tried to twist away . He let go of the fork . Yet he could n't escape . Corkery screamed again , this time not as a man might , but as a bleeding animal . He struck with his right fist , struck a blow so hard that Atkins ' jaw broke under it . His body fell halfway in a graceful motion . At this , Corkery struck again . This second blow knocked Atkins onto the grinding cables.  | He died in the next instant . Perhaps he may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . His boots became fouled in a link of one cable . His grasping hands or part of his oil clothing were caught by the other cable . Both wires whirled him over and over against a set of steel braces near the main hatch . The cables crushed him there ; the steel ate him up . This happened so quickly that the winch-men , who rarely had occasion to check the cables when they were running out , were unable to act . They were n't anywhere near the winch when the terrible screaming began . As a matter of fact , both of the winch-men said later that they were at the rail watching the lay of the cables as the net sank down . This was their duty ; because the doors of the net must fall properly in order to keep the mouth open . Neither did I have time to think or act . I had hardly pushed the folds of the net to one side before all the deck lamps went out . This blinded me . I blinked hard . At that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I turned and stretched out my hand and called her name . I said : " I ca n't see ! I ca n't see ! " She took her place beside me . I said : " Atkins dead ! " For a time , I was unable to see . It was a passing blindness that made much trouble for me later . But I could n't see after that bright glare went off . It was n't so with Nora Doonan . Having come out of the darkness in which the Hind 's dory lay , she had full use of her eyes . She saw the opening of the pilot-house door . A cry of anguish came from that door . She cried out , too , cried loudly so that she might be heard above the shouts and oaths of the crew , who , like myself , had been left in darkness , their sight baffled . She said to me : " Parren ! He struck the captain ! " P231Another boarding sea ran its course over the dragger . A man at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the lights ! A man crushed here ! " My sight returned . The first thing I made out was far away on the Hind . A light , as golden and as beautiful as her name , rose on her deck . She bloomed in the night . Bars of golden light shot against her sails and into the dark around her . This was in obedience to the owner 's order concerning the torches , yet to me it seemed a curiously timed gesture of defiance , as if the Hind were determined to stay in the light , where she had always lived and where her beauty belonged . The next thing I saw ( that Nora saw also ) was Captain LeNotre rising out of the whirl of foam amidships . In the dark , his yellow head and yellow slicker marked his steps . He fell across the braked wires and rose again . For an instant , he crouched near the stupefied Corkery , who had jerked the tine out of his hand and stood staring at his own blood . A brook of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slant from the starboardgallows and spilled against the main hatch , which was open . A brightness came out of that foam , such as phosphorescencemight provide . It was this light that showed us clearly ( aye ! beyond all doubt ! ) the blow struck against Corkery by Paul LeNotre . I saw the sleeve of his slicker shine in a backwardsweep . I saw his bare hand gleam and I saw the glitter of blade and ivory handle . The knife-hand swept over and struck hard . Corkery leaped into the air , arching his back against the stab . Life ran out of him . Yet he did n't seem able to fall . He danced lamely against the roll and pitch of the Doubloon . LeNotre 's hand came away empty . He stepped back , his empty hands held before him in a groping , crazy way . I rememberwell that he clenched and unclenched his knife-hand ;  | and once he actually peeked into it , as if something good was held within the curl of fingers . The same man in the darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's have the lights , will you ? Man hurt here . Oh , my God ! " At that appeal , one of his chums uttered a warning . An even greater sea had spun up in that same freakish style of the Middle Ground . Its clamor drowned all outcries and stopped all action . I shouted to Nora : " Stay here ! Hang on ! " I took a step out of my shelter . The threat of the onrushing sea blocked me again . I moved backward and stretched my hand sideways until it struck against the stay . I 'd swiftly judged the force of the fresh sea . It was too much to stand up in . It was then that I saw the sea pick up Corkery 's body , even before it had well fallen , and swing it clear of the tackle . The sea caught Captain LeNotre in the open . Dead man and living man came hurtling toward the main rigging . I braced myself strongly , my hips against the rail and a foot thrust into a gallowsplate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and closed both hands on the first body that I found . A flying boot struck me hard on the jaw . I forced the body down into the scupper and , my own head smothered in foam , waited . The sea passed . The body that I had saved wrestled with me ; then the living man cursed and struggled to his feet . In the gloom , he . spewed out salt , and then , with the greatest coolness , he stared into my face and asked : " What in hell 's name are you doing off your vessel ? " I can say that this was certainly the high hand . Here was a man saved from death . Beyond doubt ; because that sea would have ' driven him breathless down into the icy water . Here was a man whose hands had just been washed clean of another'sP233blood . And yet , in these extraordinary circumstances , he did n't step outside his character of captain . I should have given him the boot . Is it to be wondered at that LeNotre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denying it . My heart grew weak under my ribs ; as any decent man 's heart may do when he stands in the presence of a calm murderer . This weakness flowed directly from my sudden understanding that a murderercan be stopped only by murder ; that you had to kill if you wished to stay in a game like this . A crack on the jaw for a sneak was about the best I 'd ever done . Such child 's play counted for nothing now . I knew , and Nora also knew , that LeNotre would now hang . We were also aware that he would fight hard and craftily to keep himself free . A hard and crafty opposition was our only course . We both understood this need ; and began in time . I gave her whitened face a quick and warning touch with my hand and began the new game with a show of natural indignation . I said : " Keep a civil tongue in your head , will you , Captain ? Are you sick ? You must be drunk ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just saved your life ? " I did n't wait for him to speak . I gave him time to sec Nora plain and then I said : " Nora and I came over to ask you to bring back our trawls . That 's all , Captain . The watch said you 'd gone over to the Doubloon and we came after you soon as we could . What 's the matter with you ? " Nora moved in the darkness . LeNotre changed his stand in order to face her . He was , of course , trying to figure out the precise moment of our arrival , so that he might determine what we had seen . Nora perceived this to be so . Therefore , when he said : " Trawls ? " she answered harshly : " Yes , our trawls . All of 34them . And we 've also come for Corkery . Atkins ca n't come aboard my schooner again . We 're thinking of trying to rig for halibut . And if we do , we 'll need a doryman . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Corkery ? " This was a thoughtful venture on his part . " You heard me , Captain ! Parren has no need of him . Now that Atkins is back . " " Atkins is dead . " He swayed slightly and held his hand toward the place where I had last seen Atkins ' body lying entangled and a man bending over it . Nora had n't seen that death . Neither had she heard my words concerning it . Therefore , her outcry was thoroughly genuine and convincing . I did the best I could . This helped LeNotre in his course . I could understand the keenness of relief that struck him . The lights flashed on . The three of us now stood in the clear . Each could see the other 's face . The deceptions that had to be practiced , so swiftly and smoothly , also had to withstand skilled scrutiny , not only from LeNotre , but from Parren , who now came toward us . Enough time had passed to permit both the captains to recover from the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost sickening fear of themselves . I saw this clearly in their eyes and by their bitten lips . Actually , there was a flow of blood from LeNotre 's mouth . Even if their deeds passed without witness , they had to bear new and old burdens of guilt . And I knew that in each man those burdens were made almost unbearable by other burdens of superstition . It was plain to us that both our enemies had the wind up badly . Their nervousness made them doubly dangerous . P235Nora cried out again . " That poor , crazy Atkins ! What happened to him ? " She stepped away from the rail and once more gave a cry , this time to the three men who were bending over the body . Shrewdly enough , I noticed that they were not touching that broken sack of bones in its ripped oil clothing . She asked : " Is he really dead ? " The draggermen acted in an odd way . They all faced her . Their mouths were tight with an undeniable terror . I knew it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , they hurried to the companionway and went down into the forecastle , pushing one another with frantic hands to get out of sight . It was now Parren 's turn to satisfy himself that neither she nor I had witnessed the murder of Corkery . This was an anxiety that LeNotre had already discerned in him . So our captain shook his head in the gloomy style and said : " They  --  they 've come for Corkery , Captain . As I did . " " Corkery ! " Captain Parren deftly snatched up the lie . He repeated the name with mournful gentleness . I Ic was keen enough to do that much , yet not quite smart enough to concealhis relief in Nora 's apparent ignorance . He drew his hand over his face , as if dazed . " Have n't you told them , Cap-tain ? " I said to myself : " What an actor we have here ! " I then put in my oar again . " Aye ! ' T is Corkery we want . And our trawls . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trawl lying on the deck . One of the draggermen had lashed them to ringbolts . " Why do you say that , Captain Parren ? " asked Nora . " What are you up to now ? Ilave n't you done enough to us ? What is it that Captain LeNotre has to tell us about Corkery ? Where is he ? Is he sick ? Has  --  has he killed himself ? " Captain Parren bowed his head in solemn grief . " Corkery isP236dead , too . " He held his hand to windward . " He killed himself ! Yes , Miss Nora . In madness , he did so . He struck poor Billy down and sent him to his death in the towing wires . He yelled out something about his poor brother and  --  God rest his soul !  --  he jumped over the rail . He 's dead . " He struck lightly at his eyes , which were actually bright with tears . " Maybe he 's better off ! " Nora let her head droop . She drew closer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poor Dan ! " We were aware now that we had only one thing to do : get safely off the Doubloon and onto the Hind 's deck again . This would n't be easy . If either of the murderers , standing before us with watchful eyes , caught the slightest hint that the noose might yet be his fate , anything might be expected . It was I who struck upon a likely course . It was , to me , the most reasonable one : that is , to pick a fight with somebody . I stood away from Nora and said : " Dan Corkery 's gone ! The same way his brother went . Well , he 'd have never been happy on this earth until the day of his death and if a man ca n't live happy he might as well be dead . " " True ! True for you , John . " Parren said this in preacher style : eyes upturned to the glowing mist , hands near to joining . " Too bad , " I said , " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he feeds the salt ! Like his brother . And there 's an end to him . " I took a step that brought me eye to eye with Parren . " Captain Parren ! " " Yes , John ? " said the preacher sweetly . " I'make no bones about it ! The first time you come ashore at Gloucester or at Boston Fish Pier , I 'm going to give you the worst going-over that you ever thought of . And you 've thought of plenty ! " P237Captain LeNotre stepped into it . " Are you mate aboard my vessel ? Or what ? " Parren hastily comforted LeNotre with an upraised hand . With his speaking eyes , he quoted a verse from Job , and said : " John 's a good boy , Paul . Over-young for his ideas , but a good boy . A good boy . He 's been under a bad strain , you know . Losing the Western Star and all that money first . And then the trawls and now his chance to use his wonderful bigmeshnets on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booming head and said to Nora : " You can see , Miss Doonan , that after what happened today , I ca n't run the risk any longer . I  --  well ! I must present my bills against the Hind when we get home . I 'm sure you see why . Plenty of money for you , just the same . Ah , never fear ! " He spoke again to LeNotre : " Do n't blame poor John . Let him speak his piece . " Nora laughed in his face ; and her laugh was a sneer . " I 'm coming to that , " said I. " That mate business . " I turned again to Parren and tapped him firmly on the top button of his slicker . " Do n't you worry about the strain I 've been under ! ' T is nothing to the strain you 're putting on yourself , Parren . I know you 're captain of this vessel and that my own captain is standing here , too . Just the same , those are my owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Which is her right . Now I 'm going to take them to the dory . You make a move against it and you get it right where you 're standing ! " " That 's a pretty way to talk , Captain Bannon , " said Parren in his bland style . " On an unhappy vessel where two good men have died only a little while ago . But if that 's the way you want it  --  you can have it . " He faced LeNotre . " Captain , I have n't any idea whose trawls those are . Lots of trawls part this time o ' year on the Middle Ground . I saw them first whenp238the bag came up . That I swear . My Bible oath . Do you want those trawls for your own use , Captain LeNotre ? " " I do . " " I give them to you . Gladly . " He gave to me a sad , sweet smile . " I 'll have my men help you , John , as soon as we get rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't lie there on deck . I 've no room for him in my pens . There 's work to be done . " He froze the pious mask of his face . " Burial at sea . He 'd want it that way , do n't you think ? " I answered roughly : " Put the Jonah on ice , if you want to . " I grew careless . I saw that we had deceived Parren and LeNotre for the time being . I paid little attention to them . However , I gave them something to think about by saying to Nora : " Tell the Lisbon to come aboard and help with those trawls . Tell Clem to shorten up on that painter . " I walked over to the first coil . I lifted a gangin and its hook to the loop of deck lights . " Norway hooks ! ' T is our gear , all right . " I ran my fingers over a gangin knot . " My own trawl . " Captain Parren shouted to the men huddled in the lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response , he strode to the forecastle companionway and shouted again : " Below there ! Tumble up and lend a hand on this poor man ! Cook , a sack of coals ! Buck , a blanket off poor Atkins ' bunk ! " He then spoke to Nora in his mourning style . " ' T is a doryman'sdeath and a doryman 's burial . After all , that 's what poor Billy was at heart  --  a doryman . " He waved his hand grandly at the black and heaving sea beyond the Doubloon 's circle of light . " A sailor 's burial , Cap'n Nora ! And Christian , too ! " He began to make me sick . After a delay , during which much talk had gone on in the forecastle and galley , the Doubloon 's cook and several men came up . They were empty-handed . Other draggermen , fiveP239in all , drifted forward . They shied from the body in such a way that Captain Parren was able to read their thought withouthearing their words . He spoke sternly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coals ? " The cook shivered ; because it was cold and for another reason . He was a skinny , little citizen . The chatter of his teeth shook him to his heels . His chums glowered at him , shuffled uneasily . He was obviously their sea lawyer . At last , in a piddling tone , he said : " No coal for a Jonah ! ' T would curse my stove . We ai n't called upon to touch no Jonah . Boys here wo n't sew up no Jonah , Captain . " He then consulted his fear of a bully skipper and added meekly : " If you please , Captain . " One of the others spoke up in a bolder strain . " Cook 's right , Captain . Besides , he ai n't our man , Billy ai n't . He 's a Hind man . Signed on regular , he was . On the Hind and must be accounted for by the Hind . " He nodded his head toward the Hind , which was falling behind as the Doubloon steamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Captain . " By this time , both Parren and LeNotre were in a new fury , which was n't to be wondered at , considering the deadly meaningAtkins had for them . Even in death , he was keeper of their secrets and heartily they wished him where Corkery , that other keeper , was : a-rolling in the tide , where the cod-end slid . Yet they themselves were so full of fear and guilt that they could n't turn their own hands to the job of burial , a task which a decent man would gladly do . They could n't even bear to look wholesomely at that jumbled face staring at their boots . Parren soon had enough of this delay and near-mutiny . He shook his head in mock regret and said : " I did n't think of that , boys . Give you my word ! Sure he was a Hind man andp240the Hind must care for him . Give him the last honors , so to speak . Christian burial . Why not ? Sure ! " He then spoke directly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us , do n't you ? " LeNotre pressed back an oath . He glanced wildly from one set face to another in order to test their firmness . He looked at Nora , found her flint-hard . He whirled around and shouted to me and to the Lisbon , who had finished carrying the trawls to the dory . " Get a move on , you two , and put this into your dory ! Dump it in ! " The Lisbon had figured out what the course of the talk had been . I myself could n't strike on a proper action . The Lisbon knew exactly what he should do ; because he had a profound feeling for decent action . Without paying LeNotre the slightest heed , he took Nora by the arm and said : " You come now , dear . We go back to our vessel . " This certainly was wholesome , and natural , too , for a Portuguese , who will not allow a woman to undergo an unseemly experience if he can help it ; for the reason that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , therefore , wishes her to live in peace and keep her memory unfouled . " You come now , dear ! " I rejoiced . Nora obeyed him without hesitation , just as she might have obeyed her father in his wisdom . I took a few steps by her side and said : " I 'll come back with the captain , Nora . Keep an eye peeled for us . " She swung her boots over the rail . There she whispered : " He 's captain no more . Get him back on the Hind  --  then he 's through . " She slid down into the dory . P241I RETURNED TO the place where Atkins lay in his blood . I said to Captain Parren : " Do I understand that your men refuse to put him over ? Just that ? Or do they also refuse to have him buried off this vessel ? If it 's all right with your men , Captain , I 'll sew him up in his blanket and let him go . I 've tipped a death-board for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " No , by God ! " LeNotre said this . The added strain of this pother over a wretched cadaver , and the stirring of secret fears drove him into a frenzy . He cursed hard and long , stamped his boots , and cursed himself so terribly that the draggermen drew off a pace . I think a wiser man than I ( Parren , for instance ) might have seen that Paul LeNotre had no wish to live much longer , if life was still to be what it had been up to now . He seemed like a man possessed . He was . I 'll say that , although I 'm no lover of myths . He gave himself the lash , raved with a violence that made me draw off , too , in fear of a crazier action . In stepping away , my boot struck against the fork that Atkins had driven through Corkery 's hand . I looked down at it . I recall that I saw , with displeasure , that the tines had n't been washed . Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He sprang forward and seized the fork . He then committed a frightful deed , which is matched in the records of the fleet only by the events on the Schooner Ilena after the Ram Island Wreck , where an insane skipper did exactly the same thing . It is my opinion that LeNotre meant to do it ; that he was looking for a fork when I kicked that one with my boot . Before any hand could strike him down or block his way , he swung the fork back , lunged forward and drove the tines deep into Atkins ' body . He bellowed in an inhuman way and , in a skilled sweep of arms and thighs together , heaved the body to the rail . The body bent and dangled . LeNotre heaved again . The corpse vaulted into the brilliant sea , arms outspread , ruined face beseeching . LeNotre sent a curse after the body and sent the fork after his blasphemy . I can recall nothing more ; because this last indignity to a man , even such a man , made me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a cry of : " God have mercy on us ! " The cook 's tardy piety , bleated in a quaver , rattled the men . They stumbled away . One began wailing with his arms flung up . Another draggerman , whose head had been lately shaved down to baldness , ran to the rail and uttered a series of low cries , or phrases , either to the sea or to the body or to some god or other . A dory-length away from him , LeNotre halffellagainst the rail . He also cried out , a pitiful sound . As before ( that is , when he had lost his ivory knife ) he held his hands out , stared briefly at them in wonderment , and then reeled toward the pilot-house . Parren had words of scorn and hate ready : " There 's whiskeythere ! " He then gave me a primary lesson in hardihood . He put on a smile of sadness , took it briskly off and at once became the draggerman again . " That 's that ! " He raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doubloon steered toward the Hind , whose splendor filled the night to leeward . P243She was under way ; and I longed to be on her sweet deck again and sailing hard for our chance at the halibut on Misaine . Yet Parren 's qualities made me resolve that I 'd not rile him again ; not until I faced him on land . Parren walked calmly to the winch , threw out the clutch , released the brakes . The cables began to grind inboard . He left the winch and came to me . " Cowards , Captain Bannon ! One and all ! I was glad to see how you behaved . Fine ! Was n't poor Billy dead ? And gone ? This Jonah talk ! Ah ! " He spat . " Your captain 's the worst of all . He worries me at times . But think nothing of it , lad . Think nothing of it . There 's fish to be hauled . Why not ? That 's all there is to it . Work ! Sure ! " I said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's in need of care and we 've got to go fishing . " " Right ! The moment the bag 's in , my boy . " He loudened his voice . " Wire-steerers ! Tony ! Buck ! Tumble up now ! " One man came up . " Ah , Tony ! That 's the good boy ! " Parren gave him a taste of geniality . Rare and short rations , though . " Where 's your chum ? " " He 's sick . " " Poor fellow ! Should n't have shaved his head . " Parren spoke in the same breath to me ; and used the same oil . " John , I know you do n't like me and you do n't like my style of fishing . But do me a favor , will you ? " " Yes ! " I was so eager to get off that cursed vessel with the captain that 1 'd have done anything within reason . " Yes , I will , Captain . " He said : " ' T is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her knot when she comes in , eh ? " I answered : " All right . But get that man into his dory , will you ? Drunk or sober , get him in . " While I spoke , I looked toward the pilot-house . There I saw LeNotre 's face ; even saw the muscles of it working in a jerky motion . " Presently ! Presently , my boy ! " Parren examined his cables and the good strain on them . This cheered him . His love of the easy dollar cheered him , even then . Another man came forward with a crowbar and took over a wire . Two more went to the gallows . The bag burst through the lighted waves . It was a good one . Yet nobody gave a cheer for it . The studded doors clatteredagainst the hull and slambanged into the gallows . The bag followed . It hoisted poorly and almost got out of hand because the men were so stricken that they would n't shout the usual signals . Had odd ideas , I guess , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crept under the cod-end , which was a job I 'd done lots of times . I had some difficulty in finding the sliprope , which had been poorly knotted . No doubt by Corkery . I gave it a jerk . It did n't slip . I took another purchase on it and put such a strain there that the knot parted violently . I lost balance and sprawled . I shouted a warning , then : " Help ! Help ! " The sea of fish smothered my cry . I went down under the blow , my knees cracking against her plates . I tried to cry out again . Slime and blood and salt choked my tongue . I fought hard to stay on my knees . I let my head go down so that my arms might protect my mouth . The vast weight  --  tons of fish  --  pressed against me and under rue . I felt the frantic blows of big cod , heard the uproar and the whispers of their dying . I heaved my shoulders against that writhing mass . Twice the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands over my head and drove them up to divide the flow . My third try did it . I sucked in air and pushed forward an inch . ByP245this time , the cod-end had loosed most of the catch . The force upon me grew less . I shouted again and tried once more to go ahead . I guess I was as strong as any man in the fleet , yet this was a job that sapped me quickly . I had to go on my knees and heave from that position . I could n't get the fish away , could n't stay down . There , in one last effort , I thrust out my hands to break through to the mesh , where I could breathe free . I can remember well that , while I fought , my stifling heart cried out : " How I have been tricked ! " It was to Parren and LeNotre I laid this fate . A wild thought . Wild ! Anger and loathing at such a death roused me up . I struck out savagely with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands closed on a man 's throat , stiffly straining against me in the suffocating dark . Certain now that I 'd been hoodwinkedby men who meant to murder me and make the murderseem an accident , I laid my hands on that windpipe . I put all that I had left in me to press the strangle . Nothing yielded . The neck did n't bend . The man did not cry out . Nor did he fight . I roared at him . He gave me no answer . I felt a hand fumbling at my chest . The cod slipped away suddenly . Free of that burden , I drove my attack forward in a lunge . Not until I had beaten that silent thing down upon the deck , not until I lay sprawled upon it , did I understand that I had fought against a dead man . " The Jonah ! " This from a voice far away . Mine ? I do n't know . In the hurly-burly of my outward fall , this shaking knowledgestayed my hands . Once I 'd filled my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I spat out the salt and gulped . I pulled my right hand away from the unyielding flesh , drew the hand swiftly down the nape , searching with fingers outspread . My fingers stopped on the hilt of a knife . I put all my strength into the wrenching draw . I pulled the knife clear of the wound , pitched away , roared for help . I slid the knife under my jacket and lay upon it ; for I knew that knife , could feel the turned ivory of its gargoyle head . I knew I had the one thing that would hang both LeNotre and Parren . The two things : the dead man and the knife that had made him dead . " The Jonah ! The Jonah ! " I heard the shouts of frightened draggermen . In that blaze of light and wonderful flow of fresh air , I struggled to my knees and dashed the slime and scales from my filthy head . I saw men running . Another man cursed and wailed : " He 's back in the bag ! Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I rolled over and crawled away from Corkery 's body . When I had gained the shelter of the forecastle hatchway , I thrust LeNotre 's knife into my boot and nicked the trouserendover it . I then staggered out into the rift of fish and flung up my hands . " ' T is Corkery ! Corkery washed overboard ! No Jonah ! Ah , no ! " Parren and LeNotre came together from the pilot-house . LeNotre had been at the bottle . Yet he had balance enough left in him to shout : " Atkins ? Atkins ? " Captain Parren cried : " What 's that you say , Bannon ? " " Corkery ! ' T is Dan Corkery ! Washed overboard and into the bag . What in blue hell is the matter with you , Parren ? Have n't ye ever dragged up a dead man before ? " The word that then passed from Parren to LeNotre was a short one . And a savage one , uttered in freedom because the draggermen had fled . Even without actually hearing it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog . He had told LeNotre that the wide bag had taken from the sea a thing that nets had taken before : a dead man . A thing from which the cod fled ; that the salt should clean and destroy . This timep247there was a difference . There lay a dead man with their knife and their knife-wound in his back . And a hangman 's noose in his hands for them . Hands that were frozen in a gesture of supplication ; and yet had mortal power . Weak beyond all saying , I nevertheless realized that I could n't withstand one blow . Had I taken the Hind 's revolver from Nora , had it been lying in my pocket instead of in hers , I 'd have killed Parren and LeNotre before they took another step . ( And this is the time and the place and the dreadful circumstances I had in mind when I said at the beginning : " I did not kill Captain LeNotre , but I would have done so ... " ) Guile was my only resource . My clearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone here , chum ! Alone ! " I fell back toward the forecastle and bent down . I filled my hot lungs again and shouted : " Tumble up ! Below ! Below ! Lively now ! Cook ! a mug of coffee ! " An answer circled up dolefully . " What say ? What say ? " " All hands ! All hands ! Lively now ! " I looked to Parren . The two captains had reached the body . Its face , barren of all that had once made the thing a man , stopped them there , and by its ghostly force enthralled them , chilled their hearts as its own heart had been chilled by death and the wintry deep . The half-open mouth accused them , offered up an indictment that they must answer . And there could only be one answer to this unuttered cry of " murder ! " That answer was the same word , the same act . LeNotre came around the body . Parren stepped over it . Their hands clenched and unclenched . Each face showed yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mouths open also , to take in air for hearts awake to daring . I said quietly : " I 'm all right . All I want is a mug of coffee to get the taste out of my mouth . I slipped . Why in hell don'tp248you teach those bums how to knot a slip-rope ? " I sagged and let my right hand fall to my boot and I said to myself : " I 'll rip LeNotre and gut the other one ! One more step and I 'll take them . " They did n't take the step . In time , the Doubloon 's cook came teetering out of the companionway , a pitcher of coffee in one hand and a mug slung on his little finger . Ile said : " You call for coffee , Cap-tain ? " He saw dead Corkery and squealed , hunched up like a doll of a man . He took half a step backward . I caught him by the arm and roared in laughter . I snatched the pitcher out of his hand and kicked him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you lousy greenhorn ! ' T is only poor Dan Corkery . Go take a look at him ! " Another draggerman came up . I laughed again in my relief and joy ; for I knew these to be cowards , men of base ignorance . I said : " It 's not the Jonah come back . Only poor Corkery . Washed overboard , he was . Throw something over that face or it 'll drive you all mad . " I poured a mug of coffee and dumped it into my mouth , shook the hot drink back and forth and spewed it . I poured another and let it wash down . Did it again and my belly began again to sing out in the old strain . I stepped forward , filled the mug once more , and held it out to Captain LeNotre . " Drink up , Paul ! It 'll do you good . " LeNotre did n't have a knot left in him . His heart was out . He had fallen into that queer listlessness . Deeper this time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a dead voice . Like a child bidden by his father , he drank . It 's incredible , yet it 's true , that it almost broke my heart to watch him swallow ! Why ? Ah , who can tell ? I hated and feared him , P249yet that plain , natural act of drinking , there on the cursed deck , filled me with a pity so powerful that I had to turn my eyes away from him . I then took the mug and handed it and the pitcher to the cook . I turned back to the body . A grey blanket flapped out and then settled over it . I said loudly : " Well , here 's one drowned man who wo n't rest easy until he has the old earth over him . He 'll not feed the salt . " I bent over and heaved the body to my shoulder . There it lay like a man of ice . " One man who 'll get what he wants  --  Christian burial ! " I gazed at Parren over the blowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let this repeated lie give them what present comfort there was in it . I then added : " I came here for him alive . I take him home dead . This here is my old friend , my father 's dorymate . I 'll kill the man who stands in my way ! " I swung around toward the rail , where the painter of LeNotre 's dory was fast to the chains . I said gently : " Come along , Captain . Come along home and take a good kink . " LeNotre stumbled after me . " Why ! " he said in a meek and sleepy voice , " I do need a sleep at that . Yes , 1 do . That is , if I  --  if I can  --  " He stumbled forward . Captain Parren held out his arm . But LeNotre , unseeing and beyond all caring , pitched past that barrier . Pitched past ? Aye ! he did so . Yet I take it that it was neither drink nor weakness that made him take his steps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Rich and strong and wise Parren ? Did Captain LeNotre know , even then , whither he was bound ? I choose to think so . P250BEFORE I had taken ten strokes on the oars , the Doubloon 's deck went dark . A sea lifted the dory , rolled away ; and she pitched into a trough so deep that , for a little while , I had nothing but darknessto live in . I swung hard and drove up . I saw the sea break over the dragger and hide her . Before I ran deep again , I made out her port light . It pierced the spray ; and seemed a bloodshoteye searching for me . Thus far I had gone in my fancy  --  to think that of a light ! The dragger was under way , and following me toward the golden pool in which the Hind sailed . It was no surprise to me that Captain Parren should pursue me . I knew that the body under the thwarts could only be a lodestone to his heart . No matter what other course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heart must point him in the Hind 's wake to follow her relentlessly ; because the Hind could not only enrich him now : she could also rob him of his very breath , once the body of Corkery was aboard her and safe in a guarded pen . To Parren , and to the man slouched in the stern-sheets , the knife in Corkery 's back was a mortal tell-tale . I made up this opinion : that Parren now pursued me in order to stay with the Hind until the captain could strike upon an action that would free him . That action had already been chosen by Captain LeNotre . P251I lifted the stroke a peg . The dragger 's lights rose and fell steadily on my course . I rowed without speaking to the captain . At times , I thought he had fallen asleep . He kept the same pose : his bare , carroty head hanging forward , his hands slack between his knees . I sang out to him once , fearing he might be cold . He made no answer . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my boot ; for I 'd had all I could take of his artfulness , his treachery . And did n't put it past him to attack me then and there , kill me , and pull the dory plug , thus washing all away . I drove the dory through a tide rip , which sent up a dewy curl of light . This increase showed me a change in the captain . His eyes were open . The light gave to one of them a moonstonehue . He seemed to be staring directly at me . I spoke up in a cheerful tone ; having become , by now , a liar of some skill . I said : " Feeling O. K. , Captain ? " His reply startled me . " Vessel on fire ! " I glanced hastily , warily , over my shoulder . I saw the yellowblaze heaving to the northward . At first , the flames seemed miles away . I turned again to take a leeward look , where there was less spray . The fire was much nearer than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divided into two parts , then into three and four ; and each became smaller , candlelike , except that they moved onward lightly , making a dance of it such as fireflies make in the gloom under apple trees . I said to myself : " He 's far gone to say Vessel on fire ! ' " And to him : " No , Captain . It 's no fire . They 're at work on the Hind , rigging trawl again . And she 's bearing down . Soon we 'll be aboard . Soon you 'll sleep . " To this , he said nothing . His head sagged once more . I changed course to answer the sweet rush of the Hind toward me . My longing for her deck grew to a pain . TheP252green light of the Doubloon swung up and down , where she changed also . I soon made out the Hind in full . All her torches were going . Their long handles held the flames high , so that a shower of light filled her deck and flowed over her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last , into a moonglade , through which she glided handsomely . I gave her a hail . " Ahoy the Hind ! A dory ! Dory ! " She was too far off . I waited until I could make out the men bending over their trawl tubs and wielding gangin boards . I hailed again . This time , the bow-watch answered . I saw him run by the gleaming jib . I heard his loud " Wur-oo-oo ! " I came up to leeward of her and flung my painter into the silent throng at her rail . I heard one calling to Nora Doonan . She came to the rail . A doryman put a strain on the painter ; another drew in the stern with a hook . I said : " Give the captain a hand , chum . " My words cast a slowness into their actions . There was a standstill . What had they expected ? I do n't know . I said in a sharper tone : " Look lively there ! " LeNotre rose and tried to go up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A pair of hands reached down and drew the captainup . He sprawled on the rail , looking downward , as if his head were too heavy for him . He said nothing ; only swung in and went down the deck . I slipped the hooks into the dory-straps and waved the dory up . I jumped out and , with no word concerning my other passenger , guided the dory to the nest . It was top dory , of course . I climbed into it again and there fumbled about a bit , in a pretense of tending gear . Pulling the plug , maybe . I looked down at the staring throng , eyeballs straining and gleaming , bronze and brassy flashes coming off their jaws in the torchlight . They expected something . P253The watch aloft yelled : " Wu-wu-ree-ee ! " and : " Dragger coming up ! Hey , below ! On deck ! On deck ! " So set were they in expectation that they kept their gaze on me . Here and there I saw a lip lift up and teeth shine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time with much indignation : " Dragger , I say ! Is that well ? Is that well ? " I turned my face upward and cried : " Oh , aye ! ' T is well ! " And to those below the nest I said : " He follows us , just the same . " I heard men in the outer rank murmur : " Follows us ! Follows us ! " And all shifted in uneasiness and wonderment . Not wishing that they should know , right then , what had befallen me and what a strange haul I bore , I sent them back to their trawls by saying : " You , Clem ! You , Terry ! Stand by here . " The grey man and the Lisbon came out of the ranks ; and the others fell backward to their tubs . I beckoned to the two and to Nora and called them to my side . I pointed to Corkery 's body and said : " I 've another passengerunder the thwarts . The body of Dan Corkery ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IIer words came up on a sigh . The Lisbon crossed himself . Old Clem said : " Eh , my lad ? What 's that you say , Johnnie ? " " ' T is so ! " I told them all that had happened to me on the Doubloon , and when I spoke of the fish near drowning me , they stretched out their hands . Aye ! and when I told them how I had strangled the dead , she bowed in anguish , tho ' it was the least terrible of all the deeds she must hear . Surely , no doryman ever recounted a stranger and sadder tale to his mates . A tragic tale , and one that set up a stir in souls , as it did , on first telling , in my own ; so that I could hardly credit my own words . Because foreboding gave forewarning to them and to me , making their looks of horror change to looks of beseechment , sent from one pair of swimming eyes to another , thence to mine . The Lisbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law ! Lest he run us under ! " Old Clem said : " Out all lights , Johnnie ! Drive for Tor Bay ! Rockets for the law to stand by . " I had n't the will to pay them heed . No ! nor hardly the strength to listen at all , because of my weariness . This she saw and closed her hand over mine , clenched on a thole-pin . I gazed at her ; and found her almost unknown to me . Hard to remember then that I had once considered her mouth a beauty of my world ; because the way we 'd gone had racked it until all sweetness fled . She had grown old , gaunt , and a smear of torch oil lay across her cheek , like a disfiguring birthmark . The visored cap , pulled down over her braids , made her seem like a young sea captain , worn beyond youthful strength by running before a gale in a sea not known . Nevertheless , the torchlight , flowing in waves of splendor a-down the foresail , revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lashes , left them beautiful . Before she spoke , her eyes told me the story : that she had n't flung down her gaff . No , nor her gobstick , either . The helmsman cried : " Hard alee ! Hard alee ! " " Hard alee ! " " Hard alee ! " And : " Topmastmen ! Topmastmen ! " " Ha ! Ha ! " and : " Corry ! he 'll punish her . Lively now , chum ! " " Topsails ? " I said . " Topsails on a night like this ? " I looked aloft to measure the clouds blowing past the stars . " Leave be , lad ! Leave be ! " P255I turned and fixed upon the Pole Star , toward which we sped ; and at this turn away from light a shadow fell upon my face ; or some portion of my inner dark shadowed me . For I had murder in my heart again ; and lost my little joy thereby . Which she , in her wisdom , perceived ; and we were joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not been since three seasons past . The Hind had been sailing to windward . Now the helmsmanbrought her up and shouted . The dorymen answered loudly and they hauled . Booms and sails crossed in turn . The Hind fell onto the new tack and lifted her pace . Amidst the cracking and clanking of sails and gear , I heard Nora cry out to us : " No ! " So I said : " No ! A-fishing we must go " ; and I pulled the ivory-handled knife out of my boot , laid it on the palm of my hand so that they might see the Miquelon gargoyle of its hilt and the stare of the gargoyle , queer and thirsty crone . Yes , thirsty still . " From now on , you Clem , and Terry here , are to know all that we know . All that I know especially . Because if I tell Nora something in your presence , it 's proper evidence for the court of inquiry . For it 's to the court we 're all going in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of harm 's way . " I held my hand out farther . " You know this knife ? " " The captain 's ! " " She told you that Billy Atkins was killed ? And how ? " " Aye ! " " And that we saw LeNotre kill Dan Corkery ? " " She did . To us alone , she said it . " " This knife did it ! In the captain 's hand . At Parren 's word and his blow . Bear it in mind now ! I took this knife out of Dan Corkery 's heart and I hid it from them . Bear that in mind . "   " We will bear it , Johnnie . " I kicked up the thwart and folded the blanket back . I then turned the body until the back showed and the rip in the slicker . I said : " It 's there the knife went in and it 's the wound this knife made  --  and our word  --  that will hang his murderers . But say to the others now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept secure until we get home . Or find the law . I 'll keep the knife . Put the body into canvas and slide it into Number Three pen . There 's no fish there yet . Lash it . Do n't sew it . " I jumped down to the deck , where I said to them : " For the time being , we 'll keep this to ourselves . Every man must show all respect to the captain and watch him hard . And they wo n't do that if they know what we know . They 'd iron him and give it away  --  because  --  mind you !  --  he 's sure we know nothing . And a growl would put him wise . " The old men called others from the tubs and talked to them and said that Dan Corkery had been drowned . I heard a doryman cry out : " Dan , too ? " and another said in amazement : " Brought up in the bag ? God help us ! " After this , they took down their shipmate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lashing for it . I said to Nora : " I 'll turn in now . In the forecastle . Let me sleep long as I can . I couldn'r sleep aft with him near me . I 'll take Atkins ' bunk . " This made me shiver a little ; could n't help it . I laughed poorly and said : " Hope the Jonah 's ghost do n't board us . " I took up her hand in my hands and found it cold . I asked : " Can you sleep , my girl ? You need it . " " I tried to , John , while we were waiting for you . I 'll try again . But before you sleep , you 'll have to come aft with me . I ca n't face him alone . I 've waited long enough to do this . I waited because Ambrose told me to . And the Lisbon . AndP257you . Whatever fate Paul LeNotre meets , he 'll not meet it as captain of the Hind . He 's through . A prisoner aboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say ; and she had an even more difficult word to utter . She took some time to make it ready and , as she spoke , kept her eyes fixed sombrely on the shimmering flood that we drew along with us . " John , you came on here as a doryman . I know now why you came . You are here  --  and you suffer  --  because you have always loved me . And you have loved the Hind . You must do one thing more for both of us . " " Say it ! " " You are skipper of the Hind from now on . " " All right ! " " Then call the watch . Call all hands . " The dorymen came to where we stood . She said : " I speak to you as the owner of the Hind . In order that everything shall be done properly . John Bannon becomes captain of this vessel now . Mark the time , you Clem . Hour and day . " " I will , Miss . " " Mark the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Terry and you , John , come with me and hear me tell him that he 's no longer captain of my vessel . 1 ' 11 say little of my reasons to him . But for you all  --  keep this in mind !  --  he 's a prisoner and must be watched as one . " No word or gesture came from the throng . I heard a loud murmur rise amongst them when her voice thinned at the end and she thrust her hand against her lips to keep them from saying more . She passed by the ranks and we followed . The captain lay sprawled in his bunk . At her command , he came out and stood before us , his eyes passing dumbly from one face to another . Nora said : " Captain LeNotre , I speak to you as the sole owner of this vessel . You are relieved of its command . These men will bear witness to my order . " He swayed in his place . His right hand rose in the familiar gesture and beat back strands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He gazed at her , at her alone ; and , at last , whispered : " Why ? " " Because you are unfit for duty . " I saw that he was hardly listening to her . His eyes stayed upon her , yet he seemed to be watching other things , things too terrible to be looked at long . She said : " Captain Bannon is in command . You will obey his orders as he obeyed yours . " He crawled back into his bunk . We climbed up the companionway steps . She went forward to stand in her accustomed place . I stayed by the helm and then , in order to mark the beginning of my captaincy , I said to the helmsman : " I am now in command , chum . I 'll take over . " He stepped from the wheel and I laid my hands on the spokes . " Pass the word along . No orders are to be taken from LeNotre . He 's not to leave the vessel or to speak one . Unless I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deck . I fear for him . " " All right , John . " I said : " Take in the torches . Begin forward and take them in . The work 's done . There 's no need of them now . " He went forward , presently returned and said : " Captain , Miss Nora asks  --  as a favor  --  can she have the torches for a time longer ? " He came closer to my ear and spoke in some concern for her . " She seems to like them there , she does . Does , indeed ! " " She can have them then . " Before he turned away , I said : " Clew up topsails . We wo n't carry them in this . " I said no more of the matter of torches burning ; for I had no wish to cross her . Besides , it did me good , in my uneasyp259fancy , to live for a time in such a wealth of light . When the watch changed , I went into the forecastle and slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should called be if the wind changed . P260THE Hind sped through the night with a wind that was fair for her most of the time . I took my sleep , hours of it , before the wind began to haul to the northward a little and kicked up something of a sea . I was called . I stayed below for a mug-up because I seemed weak with famine . But it was a famine not of the belly . I found Nora on deck , standing by the helmsman . She had gone down into the cabin to take a kink , but got no more than a Gloucesterman 's forty winks . The sight of LeNotre , stretched out lifelessly in his bunk , filled her with more than sorrow . Yet she was glad that he would never again give an order on the Hind ; and she was glad ( as I was ) that he was aboard ; for she was certain that if she had driven him off the vessel , as she once had wished , his presence on the Doubloon might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would produce a newer and more violent plan against the schooner . Such thoughts as these , and her new hopes for fish , kept her awake . Once while on the edge of sleep , she heard the watch hail a vessel . She hurried on deck and saw the lights of a Canadian schooner . She told the watch to ask if the sou'wester had struck him . The voice came wryly back from the other 's slanted deck : " Cost me two days ' work and some gear , my friend . " P261The Canadian sailed off . We spoke another vessel half an hour later , just as I came up . This proved to us that the schooners which had run before the gale were now retracing the courses into which they had been forced . The second hail was the Coralie , a Nova Scotian long-liner . Her watch told us that she had been fishing on the eastern edge of Canso Bank when the gale caught them and drove them clear over Misaine before it blew out . " Big sweep , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You speak any Gloucester vessels back there ? " The watch , who was little taken aback by a woman 's voicecoming off our deck , laughed and said : " Nary a one , ma'am ! Spoke the Caliban of Lockport last night . She 's all right now . " " She 's a jump ahead of you , Captain . All well aboard ! " " Ah , thank you ! " The schooner went on . Since it was full day , I sent a watch aloft with orders to speak any vessel in sight , even if our course had to be altered to do so . The exception being , of course , the Doubloon , which lay a mile or so astern , the sun flashing off her hull . About this time , the Doubloon drew a little closer ; which gave us the thought that she had once given up her pursuit and had changed again . Just as if the dragger captain had a strange communication over LeNotre , which could call him even from drunken sleep , he came up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a considerable time ; and without any particular expression on his face . He then went forward , greeting us in an offhand manner , and went down into the galley for his breakfast . He did n't take much . He came on deck again , where he behaved just like a doryman . He did it with much grace ; even joined in the patching of an old trawl that Ernie Wagner found in a locker . He talked of fishing ,  | talked in such calmness that Nora and I looked at each other , wondering at the fathoms of his guile . Old Clem told him that we were going to make a set on Misaine for halibut . LeNotre said : " It 's worth trying if Ambrose 's chart says so . Though I 've never killed halibut on Misaine to any extent . Still , it 's a wandering fish , the halibut . And must have gone somewhere from the Grand Bank . " I learned quite soon that he secretly sought amongst the the fishermen for their account of his removal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no hint that they knew of his deeds ashore and aboard the vessels . By agreement , it was left to Clem to quit LeNotre 's suspicion and stop his guesswork . Clem spoke sternly to him of the sin of taking whiskey aboard the Hind . He made such a fatherly sermon of it that LeNotre , I think , soon accepted this as Nora 's chief reason . This must have seemed reasonable to him because of the words she used in discharging him . . . " unfit for duty . . . " Perhaps this deceit was an error on my part ; and it might have been better to at least hint that there was something else on our minds ; for our way of doing things left his mind free for the deed he resolved upon . About noontime , I again had the helm . I had just repeated the course after the helmsman when a man aloft sang out . Another man , going up to relieve the watch , stopped in the shrouds and sang out for something , too . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until they heard my : " Hard alee ! " I swung her over onto the other tack . The bow-watch then sent back word that a capsized dory had been sighted . In ten minutes , the Hind came up to it . I brought her into the wind . The Lisbon thrust down a boathook and caught the dory where its bottom-boards had been stove in . He leaned overP263and examined her sides . He spoke briefly to the Nova Scotian hand , who was standing by . Ernie nodded and said : " Yes . That 's right . " The Lisbon shouted to me : " Shelburne dory , Captain . Name of the Caliban . What you say ? " " Let her go ! " The Lisbon twisted the hook out and the dory whirled into our wake . The Lisbon stayed at the rail alone . He gazed after the dory thoughtfully ; then drifted aft and stood there , his eyes fixed on the wreckage . He was watching something else , too : the tenacious Doubloon standing on our course . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the dory , hooked it as he had , examined it closely , and let it go . She then came on at a faster clip and shortened the distance between vessels . The Lisbon reported this to me . I could make nothing of it , at the time . Flour after hour , the Golden Hind sped on her course . At times , she logged over thirteen knots because the wind freshenedand stayed fair for her and we had put on all her muslin . In the afternoon , I judged that we were not far from the edge of the Bank . I went down to look at the old chart and came on deck with the order : " Bait up ! " I kept the schooner under jib and jumbo for the slow sailing of the set . And I can remember that all of us became livelier as the time for fishing came nigh . For myself , I considered the venture a questionable chance . I said something to the effect ; and hardly had the words out of my mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tune . I whooped and pointed to the edge of a tide-rip to leeward . For a time , no other man could make out what I had seen ; then a grey shape flashed out of a curl of foam , which had hidden it , and hurtled across the black rip . It was a halibut , in such good spirits and so hungry that he had chased cod to the surface . The men saw him thrash and dive back to where he belonged . One shouted : " There goes twenty dollars ! " Another : " And here we go after him ! " I waved my hand . " Buoy away ! " The dories dropped off . I watched them anxiously . To the southward of them , the Doubloon lingered . The sea lay flat between us ; and , it being slack water , the dories moved easily through the set . There was no great margin of time before nightfall . Therefore , I had told the dories not to return after hauling . One by one , I saw them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of them were on the way back to the inner buoys . There they tied up to wait for the fishing signal . The men lay down in the dories to keep out of the wind , so that their dories seemed unmanned and whirling adrift . I gave the fish two hours to feed . At last , I brought the Hind around and began the passage down the line . Half-way down , I blew the signal . No sooner had the dories taken in their buoys than a piercing blast from a conch horn blew over the water from a dory in the middle . " Hey ! " cried the cook . " Wait a minute ! " I listened . The horn stayed silent ; then a chorus began , a good clamor that sent the news from dory to dory and onward to us , anxious on our deck . " They 've struck in ! " The cook danced a step to mark his joy . " Halibut ! By the Lord Harry ! we 're all rich men . All of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " You found them , my girl . " " True ! " said I. " Struck in all right ! But is it halibut ? " I added a dampener for him : " Ca n't be , chum ! They 'd be a long way from home . " And yet I wanted it to be so ; becauseP265the price of halibut was not much lower than the price of gold . I kept my eyes set on that dory in the middle . Presently I saw an arm raised . A doryman bent in the gaffing blow and leaned far over the gunwale to handle his fish . A flat , grey shape came up against the sideboards . I shifted my gaze . I saw the same picture again and again : the gaff upraised , the strain , and a big fish thrashing against black dory-sides . I said : " Cook , it 's halibut . Never thought I 'd live to see the day . " I sent him below to give the story to Nora . We had n't long to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another drew behind it , and a third and fourth followed . The dories rode deep . Sometimes , in the long slide over rollers , the dories cantered a bit and showed the grey fish gleaming in rich piles . They came alongside and , without a word to say for themselves , began forking the halibut , great and small , into the checkers . There were fish that weighed two hundred pounds , others of a hundred ; and doryloads of chicken . There were fine steaker cod , too , fit to lie alongside the halibut . The cook began big talk about thousands of dollars ; and the men , as they came aboard , sang out the praises of old Ambrose and of Nora for remembering his word . They had her bring up the chart , which he had left for us , and they read the legend written on Misaine long before she and I were born . " Halibut here-6o,000 in two days " and , in a less legible scrawl : " Told nobody at home . " " Neither will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fish , ate , and dropped the dories for a second set . This was a harder one , because the tide was running the other way ; and we did n't finish until the moon had risen and the north had filled withp266stars . There was much light , yet not enough , of course , for our knives . Therefore , the torches were set up as before . Our luck held ; our skill matched the luck . One by one , the dories sailed homeward and again the pitchforks whirled and tossed in the torchlight . On either hand , the dories came in ; two at first , then three , then the sixth and seventh , until all but one were in the nests or were unloading . This late dory gave me some concern ; because the fishermen in it were recklessloaders , who had laughed and sworn that they 'd come home standing on fish . Good enough to say so , but there 's a danger in over-loading , especially in late season fishing . For myself , I 'd let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by too much . I said to Nora : " Give him a wind of the horn . " She whirled the crank a few times . I sent her into the swifters to see if she could make the dory out in the moon-glade , which was where I judged it should be fishing . I could n't help a creepy uneasiness , because the Doubloon was lying in that direction . To Clem I said angrily : " There 'll be a sermon preached when they do come in . And you know the text ! What the devil 's wrong with Ernie ? " Clem replied : " Johnnie , they 've been hungry a long time and they 're thinking of dollars for home . " A curious thing happened then . So far , the Doubloon had kept her position astern . She began to close up in the moonlight , her port light showing . This change in her position was marked by my men . I should say : marked with anger . This did n't rise out of fear of losing fish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank for all ; and no dragger could rob them of the fish on the bottom ; for there was never a net made that could handle bigP267halibut . I knew the course of their thought . It was mine also . I said to myself : " Hey ! I 've got enough of that tramp . I 'll board him and knock his block off . I 'll teach him to hang around my vessel . " I called a doryman . " Keep that last dory down . I 'll be needingit . " The Lisbon , who had the helm , heard me and sang out : " What say , Captain ? " I had n't time to answer . The Doubloon had come up so close that I thought she meant to speak the Hind . Our torchlightbeat upon the faces of men standing between her pilothouseand winch . I saw at once that they were n't giving us their attention . No , they were all looking beyond us and into the moon-glade . I mulled this over and could n't make head nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doubloon swung sharply to port . I heard her gong beat for full speed . Her engine loudened and she plugged off into the northeast . Her lights went out . She smashed into the moon-glade , cut a wide swath there , and became a part of the darkness beyond . This pitch-poling business left my men amazed ; and me up the same old tree . I knew that in Parren I had a cunning man to deal with ; and one that been a notable seaman in his days of sail . This knowledge and my instinct made me say aloud : " He 's out-smarted me ! " " How 's that , Captain ? " I did n't answer . A foul thought had come uppermost : " Has he killed my dory ? " Not so . It was n't that . We put our heads together ; that is , Nora and four or five men stood by me . All silent . A man at the dory-nest broke into it : " Want we should haul up on this one , Captain John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boarding party . I said : " Haul up ! " I stood baffled ; and hated to be so . The blazing torches left my face an open book . To my shame , I did n't like it to be read . Yet this was simply newness of command , a natural thing . I looked from one face to another and said nothing . This was the moment when Nora heard ( or thought she heard ) a faraway cry drifting over the water . She moved to the lee rail and leaned out , trying to search out that cry above the noise of the tide . This stirred me up . I asked : " You hear anything ? " " I 'm not sure . " Old Clem said : " I heard a gull crying . " " No ! " I do n't know who said that . Then , right up under our weather rail ( the starboard ) , a voice said quite calmly : " Hey ! Take a painter , will you ? " This was Ernie Wagner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen ; because we were all intent on the hail ( if it was that ) which had come from leeward . Someone took the painter and in a hushed voice said to Ernie : " Shut up ! Stand by ! " " Oh , aye ! " A yell burst out of our bow . An old hand on watch there shouted : " Sail ho ! A sail ! A sail ! " " Where away ? Where away , Tom ? " He came stumbling aft , crying out and pointing into the darkness beyond the tide-rip , which is to say at about the position where the Doubloon had jumped out of sight . A silence swept the Hind like hail . And this speechlessness at the sighting of a sail , drawn to us by our torches , showed me that Nora 's secret hope , held in silence before and now , P269had become their hope . When it became mine , I can not say ; because of a crowded memory on which a hard strain has been put . A shadow beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of foam under the bow of a dory ; and a grey slant above the bow turned into a rag of sail . And all along the gunwale other gleams appeared and became brighter where the oars were feebly dipping , barely touching the stream , and lifting feebly again . Now I heard the wail ; this time stronger ; and it seemed to be a question uttered in a pleading voice . I wished to speak . I could n't . Nor could the others . We gazed enthralled at that dory , gazed at the men bent on her thwarts , and at the festoons of frost glittering there . The oars ceased . The voice of an old , old man cried out : " Ahoy the schooner ! Ahoy ! Be that you , the Golden Hind ? " All I could say was : " Come in , the dory ! " The oars struck again , harder this time . A sea pushed the dory onward until she glided near . An oar slipped and rattled in thole-pins ; and the same old voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that , my good man ! " A painter came looping over our rail . In silence yet ( the silence now of too great happiness ) , the Hind 's people reached over , holding out their hands . I saw a yellow glove flash in the spray . I saw a hand , clad in the yellow glove , reach up and close upon the Lisbon 's arm . The Lisbon heaved , bent backward and said in a choked voice : " Madre de Deus ! " He heaved around and there ! there , at last , he stood before me : huge , frosted , indomitable  --  the Yankee conqueror of the gale ! 1 could n't break my lips apart . My heart shouted : " Live forever , Cameronian ! "   The hero took one little step . He struck his gloved hand against his mouth and cried out : " Ah ! " and " Hem ! " and : " Salubrious , is it not , my dear friends ? I refer , of course , to  --  " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . His head dropped , yet never marred its nobleness . The dorymen heaved again , and again . Four heroes came over the rail and stood behind the first , their heads bowed , their eyes staring at the solid deck . A man amidships cried harshly : " Are ye ghosts there ? Or men ? " Old Ambrose took a step toward Nora . He struck the icy sou'wester from his head . It rolled on an unbending rim and stopped against the compass at my feet . He brought his silvery head up high . " In a manner of speaking , sir , " he replied , with gold-lighted eyes fixed upon her pitiful face , " in a manner of speaking  --  men ! " Even then , when the old hero had taken her heart forever as he had mine long since , she had no word for him . She made a step forward and tried to lift her arms . Her lips opened in a poor whisper . He made the step and lifted his arms , so that she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and savior . She pressed her lips into the bristle of his hollow cheek . It was this reality of meeting , their coming together , that loosed her words . She cried : " Ambrose ! And he  --  he said I 'd drowned you on that hulk ! " He opened his lips to answer . His mouth seemed ready to laugh . No laughter came . Instead he whispered : " Torches ! " and then he uttered the Hind 's old rally : " Hard alee ! Hard alee , Cap'n Nora ! Do n't cry , Cap'n ! Get it on her ! " He groaned and his head fell sideways sharply . " North-by-east ! Scatari Shoal ! " His legs shook under him . He slipped from her arms , stayed on his knees . " The Western Star ! " HeP271sprawled . " Could n't stay on her . Afloat in shoal water . Markbuoy ! Rigged it myself . " With these words , he keeled over and lay still . She wailed above him . " What ! Now ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shook away her fear of death . " Sound asleep , my girl ! Trust him ! He knows what to do . " I lifted him and laid him on the arms of my dorymen ; and they turned , shouting with joy , and bore him and his companionsto the warmth and food of the forecastle . She seized my arm . " You heard that course ! " " Aye ! " Her eyes shone fiercely and the hand on my arm trembled with such violence that all of her seemed to shudder . " Ten thousand dollars ' worth of fish iced down . A **26;739;TOOLONG beyond ! " She struck her other hand against the rail . " She 's saved ! " I stepped back and flung up my hand to the watching topmastmen . I said to her : " Yonder keel 's a loose-fish ! Belongs to the first man that sets foot on her . " The main-sheet men jumped to their stations ; and I shouted : " I 'll be that man ! Or never kill cod again ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the forecastle , aloft , and down again into the cabin , where that one lay , waiting for the turn . " All hands ! All hands ! Tumble up ! Oh , lively now ! " They swung the main-boom out of its crotch and fell upon the sail . I gave it to them ! Hey ! I yelled for sweat to show . " The Doubloon ! Lay alongside that dog before daybreak and you 're in the money ! " They roared again and hauled ; and the topmastmen ran up to the stars and lay to it . I put my hands on the spokes andp272shouted to them again : " Sixteen thousand dollars in prime lead on Scatari Shoal ! Shares for all ! The old sixty-forty lay , chums . Heave ! " " Heave ! Hey ! Oh , gorry ! Pile it on her ! " I heard old Clem shriek amidst the gang . " Hey ! Hey ! We 'll punish her this night ! " The mainsail hammered over , filled hard and made her jump . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ! Ease her , chum ! " The foresail took hold . The Hind ceased her splashing and plugged away . Now we spread all that she had : topsails , staysail , jib and jumbo . And trimmed her well until she lay over and drank the Atlantic up , running as she had run in her old days of racing . She sank the moon and tossed her spray against the last of the stars . All her gear sang out shrilly or sang out hoarsely . A booming came up from her hold and marked swift time for the headlong passage . I punished her all right , but she was the one who could take it , high seas or low ; and when she hit the long swell , left by the sou'wester , she lifted her pace until the men roared again in pleasure at her famous qualities . P273I SET THE racing watches and ordered the lifelines rigged ; for I swore I 'd spread cook 's shirt and let the Hind go until the sticks jumped out of her . We took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more . I also took in our own lights , which was a risky thing to do , but I had no wish to light the Doubloon after us in case we overhauled her or she lost her meagre bearings and waited for us . Anyway , our lights would have been of doubtful service in the first hours , because a squall or two kept us blind . And the squalls left a thick vapor after them , through which we sped , our horn bawling . I must confess that I could n't stand the pace . I was n't the sailing-master I had been . Nor the chance-taker . I shot off my mouth too much at the opening of the race ; had set up too bold a pattern , especially for a man who had been out of sail for so many seasons . Well , I 'm free to say that I did n't know the Hind any too well . Vessels age well and Yankee handiwork improves with age . Men grow cautious . As I did . I do n't know that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I could . The schooner ran dark as a whale through the thickening night . Give you my word ! I could scarcely see my hand when I struck the salt out of my   eyes . Toward midnight , the schooner ran out of the swell and struck into another squall . I could tell there was nothing much to it , but I pretended that it seemed hard to me. 1 made it count . I said : " We 'll get rid of topsails now . " This was done with the best will and speed ; and the Hind was the better for it . About this time , old Clem worked his way aft and shouted into my ear : " What 's she got in the way of knots  --  that Doubloon ? Night like this ? " I expressed my doubts . " Ten or eleven . With eighty thousandpounds in her pens  --  I do n't know . She 'll do well enough . " " We 're doing that much now , " he said . " And can do better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We put our heads together ; for this question of the Doubloon 's qualities ( if the word is properly applied ) left us baffled . There was the matter of her head-start . Were we evenly matched , that half hour or so for the Doubloon 's three hundred horses might settle the race before it had well begun . I agreed with the Lisbon that it was n't really a matter of one hundred miles . Ambrose had told him that was the distance we had to go . Our best opinion was that the Western Star lay considerably nearer ; that there was hardly a degree of latitude between us and the prize . ( Say , roughly , 45 ' to 46 ' ) . The best of men , which Ambrose was , if fighting for his life in a dory , would tend to overestimatethe distance he had sailed , especially if the sailing had been marked by squalls and ice making , which had been the case with him . Just the same , it was clear to us that for the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along . This we did . P275Nora Doonan had stayed a long time with Ambrose and his men . They told her certain things concerning the dory which had to wait for another time for retelling , but she did give me Ambrose 's words concerning the TVestern Star . She said : " She 's full of water and barely afloat . But Ambrosethinks she 'll not founder . It was n't her hull . The sou ' - wester smashed in her aft companionway and ripped off the main hatch . The seas poured into her . They stayed with her until she was awash . All lashed to the wheel . Then she ran into shoal water and they had to leave her because every sea passed clear over her . No food . No water . Lucky , he says , to get oars and a bit of sail to handle the dory  --  and almost lost Peter Lord doing that much . When the gale blew out , they steered this way . He figured that his best chance of getting picked up was to steer for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter with Cape Breton Land ? " " I asked him that , John . He could n't explain . When the whole story 's known , we 'll find they meant to get onto our course , no matter what the cost . " I asked : " Did Ambrose sight us when the Star was running before the gale ? " " Yes ! And he said to me just now : It was plain to us that you 'd come along after the Star , if you could , and that 's why we came along and kept looking for you with hope . ' " She halted over her next words and then , with some little pride , added : " They saw our torches night before last  --  " " Night before last ! " " Aye ! and steered for them , but they were so weak from hunger that they could n't fight it out . Squalls  --  one after the other  --  drove them back again . But it was our torches that kept them going . They knew what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the plain reason that therep276was no great credit in it for me ; and I stood in need of some , just then . She told me that , at the very end , Ambrose had picked up the glare of our torches again and , a little later , had made out the Doubloon passing the schooner . Ambrose knew the part that Parren and his vessel had been playing at the beginning of the voyage . When he saw the Doubloon plug off so suddenly , he had guessed that Parren had figured out where the Western Star had been abandoned and that the keel was his if he could get a man aboard before we did . This seemed reasonableenough to me , because Parren had as much knowledge as we did of the Star 's position . Nora asked : " Is n't the keel ours , just the same ? Is it a loose-fish , as you called it ? " I shook my head . " I 'm no sea lawyer , but , at the least , it 's a salvage job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know he wo n't bother with the long tow home . What 's sixteen thousand dollars to him in such a case ? To us  --  it 's life . To him  --  just a few bags of fish . He 'll ram the Star just to keep her out of our hands . " We talked then of the probable ending of the race . Our minds met on one thing : that Parren had no way of knowing how far the Western Star lay to the northward . He was as . skilled as any man in adding two and two . In this case , he had n't the two 's to add . " Unless , " said Nora , " his friend in our cabin had some way of giving him the news . Which is n't possible . " Yet this queer turn of our thought made us both realize how profound our fear of LeNotre 's cunning had become ; and , at the same time , how much wisdom we had gathered up . For we were wise enough not to slight our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us toP277fancy that a man , asleep in the cabin of a flying schooner , could manage a communication with a vessel far ahead in the pitch of night . Just the same , I called one of the watch and spoke to him . Now , before I say what I told him , I would make it clear that the events which followed my words are described as carefully as I can do the job . I 've told the story many times before ( as I said earlier ) and under varying circumstances , including the court of inquiry . Nevertheless , there are certain parts of it which could n't be told because these were events that took place inside myself and had no place in the proceedings . Yet they are required if a true understanding of the events is desired . I said to the watch : " Chum , go take a look at that lad below . See if he 's in his bunk . " This order was an error by me . If I had n't become skipper of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way , the order was like sending a boy on a man 's errand . However , I had been giving top orders for the first time in many months and the best part of my thought was intent on the vessel 's behavior and her circumstances . The actual error lay in the doryman 's execution of my order . I 've no doubt he understood its grave meaning . It is n't every crew that has to watch a man as they would a maniac ; and their own captain , at that . In this case , the ancient way of doing things served us far from well . The old way of followingorders was often a time-saver . This saving was sometimes accomplished by means of symbols and such devices . The glass was one . A glance at it might keep a man off the deck when ice was making . Sounds were also symbols to us . A constant , hollow booming when the empty Hind was going off the wind was usually a signal that she was doing all right .   A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boots , for another instance , had become a symbol , one that lived always in the back of our minds . It was a risk of death to set unshod feet on that wintry deck . We were all sad acquaintances of Jack Frost . Taking away a doryman 's cowhide boots , which protecthim halfway to the knee , was like taking away a man 's horse on the old frontier . Boots were always at the side of a man 's bunk , ready to be pulled on before he had the mist out of his eyes . After I had spoken , then , the watch pushed back the companionwayslide and thrust his head down . He immediately closed the slide and said to me : " Sound asleep . Drunk again , I guess . " The actual truth was that he had n't seen LeNotre at all . He had merely looked at his boots . These , as usual , were handy . The watch 's report satisfied Nora and me . I believe there must have been a certain apprehension existing ; because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made us hungry . I guess because of the relief and pleasure . We went down into the galley for a mug-up . I first passed up to the peak , looking into the bunks on either hand . I found Ambrose and his men doubled up . They were breathing in new life and strength at a great rate . I paused by Ambrose a while ; and then went into the galley . Nora took down a pair of mugs from the rack and poured tea . I made up a sandwich , cut it in two , and took out a platter of cake . We ate in silence and listened to the cracking noise of the Hind 's flight . I then said : " I 'm going aloft to trouble the watch . You turn in . I 'll call you if there 's a break . " " It 's too cold for a watch aloft , " said Nora .   " Not yet it is n't . But that 's what I 'm going to settle . They 'll come down if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The deck was dark , of course . There was only a slight glow out of the cabin skylight to guide her as she went along . I had given a strict order that a little light should be kept below . I climbed into the main weather rigging and went up carefully , stopping now and then to scan the sails and to search for the gleam of a mark-buoy ; for I had in mind the chance that the clockwise tide might seize the Western Star and carry her to meet the Hind . A few stars were coming out . in the west . In the east , where the day was at hand , there were clouds . I climbed to the cross-trees and struck the watch 's boot . ( This was the Nova Scotian hand . ) He bent down from the sky . I shouted : " ' Tis n't too cold , chum ? " " Not yet it ai n't ! " " Come down when it is . " " I will that , John . " I then said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swung the Star westward . Might be nearer than the old boy figured . " " Slow work ! " " Aye ! true for you . " The doryman straightened in his perch . For a while , I lay there in the shrouds , rejoicing , as always , in the beauty of the hull below me . Even in that whirl of darkness , I could see flashes of color from her runways and her inner bulwarks . The glow in the skylight made it seem like a panel of jewels , there being frost and hail on the panes . The Hind swayed at her work and , now and then , gave me a good sway up and down . I locked a leg into the rigging and looked ahead . I saw the crest of a roller crease the black and come toward the schooner . I heard its bray . This sea was a gear-smasher . Its force and direction , which would bring it in on the weather bow , gave me a quick concern for the vessel . No reason for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hind a spoke and , answering easily , she split the sea in two and slammed through it with nothing more than a dainty shake which came up lightly to my hands . I said : " Well done , the Hind ! " The boarding sea whitened her deck . She cleared herself and flew on . A hand struck at my boot . I twisted down . It was Nora Doonan , shouting to me . Her face gave off such an icy gleam , beneath the brim of her sou'wester , that I knew she had grown pale with fear . I could n't come down to her side . I shouted and thrust my boot out . She began to descend and I to follow . I slid from the swifters and stood by her side . She put both hands on my arm . I heard her cry out and I saw her eves slowly turn upwards as if she had become too tired to speak properly . I then heard these words : " LeNotre ! He 's gone ! " My state of mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Over ? " " I do n't know ! That damned doryman  --  " " What ! " She placed her lips against my ear and said : " He never looked into the bunk . Saw the boots there . But he 's gone ! " I said : " In the galley ? " " No ! " ( She had gone there at once . ) I drew her close and said : " He 's killed himself ! Over the side . Clem said he would one day . Parren feared it . Saw the noose  --  LeNotre did ! " P281She answered : " Not that one ! Not while he has a chance left . " I then shouted : " The pen ! " I should like to be able to say that I thought of this earlier , but I did n't . The reason ? Not bright enough . When I said that word , Nora said one that the wind snatched . I could tell that she had thought of the pen , too . She had n't dared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main hatch . It had n't been touched since the men closed it over the tardy load of halibut . ' Yet this had no meaning . On the Hind , there was a second way of getting into the pens . This was from the cabin . There was a bulkhead leading from the cabin to the small after-hold and a second bulkhead which opened into a gangway between the pens . In other schooners , this after-hold had been made into an engine-room . The Hind kept it as a sort of lazaret . There was a sail locker there , too , and some accommodations left over from racing days . This inner bulkhead had n't been opened for some time . Its chief use had been to send men into the pens when ice was making on her deck . In a way , that bulkheadserved the same purpose as manholes on larger sailing vessels . I opened the hatch , thrust my head down past the coaming and looked into the pens there . " All dark so far . " Nora Doonan then thrust the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expedition to the Doubloon ) I rejected it . I said : " I 'd shoot myself . I 'll take care of him with this ! " I lifted my clenched hand . By saying this , I do n't wish to put out of mind the suggestion that I had murder in my heart as I had earlier . This is exactly so . And it is absolutely true that I could kill a man with my fists , if need be . She then said : " I 'll keep it . I 'll go , too . " P282I replied : " You must come . You must see and remember . Keep out of the way , that 's all . Give me a whack at that buck . But kill him ! Kill him , if you must . A slug in the belly ! " We then went down the steel rungs . Here , between NumberOne pen and Number Two , I could see the length of the hold . What we saw was enough to stop us ! And did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a film of yellowlight playing under it . This light waxed and waned amidst a sort of vapor that came off the ice . A clearer ray of light , this time from an auger hole , shot down from the upper panel of the bulkhead . It was plain that somebody was at work on the after side of that bulkhead . I asked : " You hear anything ? " " No ! " " He 's not in here yet . " " No , John . Nearer . Get nearer . " We crept out of the pen and went into Number Four . It was partly filled with halibut , well iced-down . I pushed her up onto the layer of fish . She crouched there . I stayed by her side , my head held out into the passageway so that I could watch the bulkhead . Although we were only eight feet nearer to the light , I could now hear quite clearly the blows of a maul . At times , the booming of the schooner muffled the hammering . Once , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell off and the light went out . I figured that it was a lantern and that it had jumped off a nail . About ten minutes passed before the bulkhead opened . A considerable thickness of crushed ice had fallen against it . This ice delayed the full opening . At last , the ice fell back and the whole gangway filled with the light of a lantern , turned up full . P283I drew back , and struck Nora lightly on the shoulder to warn her . The wavering light grew brighter as its bearer approached . There was no hesitation on his part . The circle of light came right up to the pen in which we were hidden ; then it turned into Number Three pen . LeNotre rammed the lantern handle into a crack between two boards . He knelt by the body of Corkery and began to untie the trawl lines which had been lashed around the canvas . At the first untyings , his back was turned to me . Thus I could see only the rusty fingers flashing back and forth . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , LeNotre changed his position . He straddled the body . This gave us a full look at his face . It was broken up and twisted ; that is to say , the lower lips sagged in a sort of dull , meaningless way , and the cheeks had no life to them at all , save for strange blotches of crimson and black . But the eyes ! Ah , they were wonderful in the intensity of purpose , even under the half-dropped lids . Brassy gleams kept shooting from them as he followed the turns of his hands . Corkery had been laid out on his back . The men had n't been able to bend his hands . They were held upward in that same gesture of supplication . Nor had that unspeakable face changed . Nothing had been taken from the sorrowful indictmentthat it had sent up to its murderer before . The eyes gazed in unaltered , pitiful force . Few men could have withstood this spectre , which had persisted through death and icy seas and the Doubloon 's crushing net , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its old sea-home . LeNotre withstood the gaze . He cursed ! I saw his lips curve into a little " o . " The schooner lurched and his knees shifted on the layer of ice . He waited until she had settled down . Before the boomingbegan again , he struck at the dead mouth savagely and said a sentence which I clearly heard because of the triumphant loudness of his utterance . The words were strange : " The heft , eh ? Oh , you ! " And then : " Gabber ! " The last word was plain enough ; the first I could never explain . A certain feverishness then seized LeNotre , because he began his search for the one thing that would save him and Darren . He ripped the canvas away with sweeping blows . He roughly turned the body over and ripped the slicker and shirts away . Thus he laid clear the wound he had made in Corkery 's back , the wound where his own knife had found the doryman 's heart . Again I heard his words clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He swore another Miquelon oath and then cried out in English : " ' T is gone ! " I was used , by now , to the swift changes of that handsome face , but he now put on and took off his masks in such ferocious style that I must again admit that I cannotbe sure of my words ; and again plead a crowded memory . At his first oath , he frowned and sucked in his lower lip in a gasping way . This was most certainly an expression of terror . Instantly , his hope rescued him , and all that fearful dark vanishedbefore a pour of happiness which gentled his mouth and brought his head up into the angle of prayer , so that I clearly saw that the light in his eyes had become mild as a candle flame . Take my word for it , he became pious in his joy ! There 's no doubt he supposed himself fully delivered from a fate that he himself had decreed . He , the judge ; he , the executioner . I know exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sweet-tempered , where he rocked to the plungeP285and pitch of the Golden Hind . This was it : he believed that his knife had been lost in the sea when the cod-end struck the drifting body and held onto it . Almost at once , his brain rejected this idea ; and the same fear wracked him in the same way . He bent his head and stared at the purple swath of the wound and the cold , sallow flesh . These meant nothing to him . He had come there for his Miquelon knife . He meant to destroy it and the body together . He cursed again . He struck his clenched hands together in a woeful way . His mouth gaped and the beaming , black pupils of his eyes passed upward until nothing showed but the whites . He spent a little time in this awful posture and grieved aloud . He then looked down at the body , passed his hands under it and made ready to heave upward . I drew the Miquelon knife out of my boot and strode into the pen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do believe that he had lost his senses by that time . I had shouted loud enough to wake the dead . Yet he did n't look at me . No ! He stared down at the dead mouth . He might well have wished that those lips had spoken and not mine . He sank to his knees again and then let his burden go . He looked at me . I held the knife in the palm of my right hand . I said : " You looking for your knife ? " This time , the grotesque eye in the gargoyle 's head gazed at LeNotre ; and that stare , revealed plainly in the lantern 's glow , seemed arch , mysterious . Even gay . I needed some time for other words . I stepped backward to gain it . LeNotre came up in a dreadful , slow straightening of his legs . He lifted his hands , in that same weary measure , to
