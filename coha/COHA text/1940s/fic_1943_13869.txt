A large shabby second-floor room , formerly used as a photographic studio , with steps coming up . The centre wall is covered with a fresco of a blue sky with white clouds . There is a small dressing-room with a drape in the doorway . A circular platform with three steps . An electric box with a switch . A water jar with a container of paper cups . A number of pieces of gaudy furniture . A baby grand , electrically operated player piano . A blackboard on an easel , beside the piano . On the blackboard is printed : Who is Sam ? HARRY BIRD is standing in the middle of the room , throwing darts at a target on the wall , while the pianola is banging away at an old razzle-dazzle piece  --  perhaps Hand Me Down My Walking Cane . PATRICK HAMMER is seated on a divan with ROSE SCHORN-BLOOM , who is manicuring his hands . After throwing three darts , HARRY BIRD goes to the target , takes out the darts , goes to the pianola , shuts it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circular platform , and walks idly to the couple on the divan . He looks at the man , then at the woman , then walks away , and suddenly begins to reach upward as far as he 's able to . HAMMER What are you doing that for ? p. 3 BIRD I do this when I 'm tired . See ? Reach way up . High . Either this , or I jump . HAMMER Jump ? BIRD That 's right . I once jumped over a doctor who tried to tell me I ought to go to a hospital for a month  --  to rest . He was sitting at his desk at the time . I got up on a chair and jumped over him . That was seven years ago , when I was almost twenty . I 've never been in a hospital in my life . I intend to live to be as old as you are . How old are you , Mr. Hammer ? HAMMER I 'll be sixty-three on Christmas Day . BIRD You mean to tell me you were born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BIRD Amazing . ( Pause ) Where ? HAMMER Dublin . BIRD Are you from Dublin , Ireland ? HAMMER I was born there , but my family moved to New York when I was eleven . BIRD ( Pause ) How often do you get a manicure ? HAMMER Twice a week . BIRD ( Suddenly ) Well , what about it ? p. 4 HAMMER What about what BIRD I think it 's wonderful being visited by you and your manicurist , and I like the way our conversations go , but  --  let 's make up our minds , one way or the other . I 'm tired . I 'm bored . HAMMER ( Courteously ) Now , Harry , do n't get bored . Do n't be impatient . I 've told you again and again , this is not an everyday matter . I want you to get acquainted with me , and I want to try to get acquainted with you . I 've been in this business thirty-five years . BIRD That 's too long  --  What do you do ? You get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands ? You do n't need a manicure . No offence to you , Miss . I suppose you get a good tip when you manicure the hands of a man like Mr. Hammer . Or maybe you feel proud to do it . Maybe you 're satisfied to feel proud and let the tip go . SCHORNBLOOM ( Confused ) My name is Rose Schornbloom . BIRD I 'll make a note of that . SCHORNBLOOM And I 'm satisfied to do my work as I 'm called upon to do it , and to mind my own business . BIRD ( Gently ) Do n't be so proud of cleaning the hands of a corrupt man . p. 5 SCHORNBLOOM ( Excited ) Mr. Hammer is not a corrupt man . ( HAMMER smiles ) BIRD ( Idly ) You 're a mother , not a manicurist . What do you think you 're trying to do ? HAMMER ( Drawing his hand away ) What 's the matter with you , Woman ? SCHORNBLOOM I 'm sorry , Mr. Hammer . I hope I did n't hurt you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , get nervous . Let him clean his own hands . Let him keep them clean . HAMMER Just a moment , Harry . BIRD All right , one way or the other . You asked me here , and you can ask me to go . After three weeks , you may as well know I 'm ready to go . I want to take a slow drive home , before it 's too late . HAMMER Too late for what ? BIRD Too late for me . You 're sixty-three years old , born Christmas Day , but remember , I 'm twenty-seven . HAMMER Harry , I 've told you before , President Roosevelt himself has informed me  --  BIRD Listen , Mr. Hammer , you do n't have to give me that big-man stuff . I know you 're a big man in this country . That 's fine , but it 's got nothing to do with me . Now , what 's on your mind ? p. 6 HAMMER I want you to write the greatest story ever written . ( Pause ) Ave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you talking about ? HAMMER I 'm talking about a great story . America needs that story , as only you can write it . I want your great under- standing , your sympathy , your compassion for little people , for soldiers , sailors , and marines . BIRD I never saw a soldier in my life . HAMMER That 's what I mean , Harry . Your understanding for young men dressed like soldiers , sailors , and marines . ( Piously ) Ave  --  Maria !  --  the whole bleeding heart of humanity  --  while beautiful aeroplanes destroy great cities  --  cities made of human spit and pain , every one of them the holy home of life , destroyed overnight in evil darkness  --  Ave Maria , Harry , while whole nations change or die  --  brotherhood smashed , family torn apart , and the dream of life broken like a cup struck by a hammer  --  BIRD Yeah , and that 's your name  --  Hammer . HAMMER ( Swiftly ) The dream of life broken like an egg dropped from a trembling hand . Ave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pray , and the fathers of men rock in silence with shame and grief . ( Pause ) The whole world 's gone mad and no man knows who 's innocent or guilty . That 's the story , Harry , and you 've got to write it for me . Ave Maria , while each of us is murdered , while each of us murders his brother . Ave Maria , Harry , while  --  ( Pause . He looks at his hand being manicured ) p. 7 BIRD ( Interrupting ) You get your claws trimmed , and I watch , and worry about Rose . ( To ROSE ) Get yourself with child . Mr. Hammer needs him for the great epic he 's just written . SCHORNBLOOM ( Softly but with terrible rage ) I do n't know who you are , but whoever you are  --  I think you ought to know I am a mother . I have four children . I have a son almost as old as you are , in the Army . BIRD ( Gently ) Then you married the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to hell . If you can be vulgar , so can I. You go to hell , you  --  you  --  BIRD I 'm sorry you married the wrong man . I 'm sorry you had the wrong children . SCHORNBLOOM The wrong children ? BIRD You never saw your kids the way they are . You wo n't mind at all if the soldier 's killed , because he was a mistake in the first place . The whole thing was a mistake . Your children , as well as the war . SCHORNBLOOM ( Standing , to HAMMER ) Every mother feels her children are n't the right ones  --  the ones she really wanted , the ones she always loved , even before they were born . It 's only evil rudeness to tell a mother such a thing . ( She turns and runs down the steps , out of the office ) p. 8 BIRD I 'm disgusted with myself . HAMMER No , Harry ! That 's what I want . That 's exactly what I want . Ave Maria ! The story of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll give the human race a new birth . BIRD You 've been talking to Ben Manheim . Well , he does n't know the war 's over . He 's a great man , one of the few people I 've met out here who does n't make me sick to my stomach , but he 's a fool too . He 's been trying for twenty years to be a saint , and you wo n't let him . Why do n't you let the man be a saint ? You 'll make more money than ever . He 's so backward and noble he does n't know the war 's over . HAMMER But the war is n't over . BIRD Do n't be a dreamer , the war 's over . HAMMER Well , sometimes I ca n't follow you . Harry , but I know your heart 's in the right place , I know you can write , and I know you 're a genius . BIRD That 's a lot of hooey . I did n't need to hurt that poor woman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers . HAMMER I 'll send her some . BIRD ( Earnestly ) Will you ? Thanks . I 'll pay for them , but put your name on the card . You mean a lot to her . Send her some candy too , and some books . Do n't send her any of my books . She 'll buy those herself  --  and read them secretly . She 'll love them too . When are you going to read a book ? p. 9 HAMMER Now , Harry , I have n't time to read . But I promise you this  --  if you write Ave Maria for me , I 'll read it . BIRD Thanks . That 's a mighty tempting offer . ( Pause ) I would n't work for anybody . HAMMER But if you come into this organization , you 've got to work for somebody . BIRD Who , for instance ? HAMMER Me . I 'm not so bad . I think I understand you . I believe I even like you . I 've heard not many people do , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you I like you . I know this business , and I know when I 've run into a real writer . Write Ave Maria for me . I 'll pay you anything you like  --  anything at all . BIRD What the hell 's happened to you , anyway ? Why do those words mean so much to you ? What are you driving at ? HAMMER I admit I 've not lived a blameless life , or that I live a blameless life now , but I would like to live a blameless life . BIRD Then do it . Why do n't you do it ? ( Pause ) Because you 're a crook . HAMMER I know , I know . If you insist , I 'll admit I 'm a crook . Or what you call a crook . But who is n't ? You ca n't survive in this world and live like a decent human being , that 's all . You ca n't ! I 'll go to my knees like this , reverently , to any man who can do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crook , because I 'm more than that  --  a damn sight more . You do n't want to write Ave Maria because you know it means a lot to me  --  personally  --  and you 're right . Sure it means a lot to me. p. 10 BIRD Why ? HAMMER ( Confused ) Why ? I 'll tell you why . ( Suddenly angry ) I 've got a lot of respect for you , young man , but I can be tough too , and I can tell you to your face that I think you 're a gutter boy  --  and you 'll never leave the God damn gutter , because it made you . You only looked up and found the stars , you did n't put them there . ( Pause , gently ) I would n't talk this way to my own sons  --  three great big half-wits , breaking their necks trying to be big men . Big men ! You told the poor manicurist the truth , and you told me the truth , too . My sons are the sons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in the world is truly my son , it 's you , Harry , and I tell you you 're a tough gutter boy who would knife me in two minutes if you could . BIRD You 're a great actor . HAMMER The greatest in this business , but I 'm not acting now . You have n't seen me act . I 'm not laughing in my heart the way I do when I 'm teaching some fatheaded actor or actress a thing or two . I 've gotten old . I 've never known until now how old I 've gotten . It makes me cry  --  all the time . Write the story for me . You 're my son , and I 'm an old man . ( Pause ) Now , how about it ? BIRD Get away , old man ! ( He goes to the stairway ) p. 11 HAMMER ( Leaping ) You 're a guttersnipe ! You 're a common guttersnipe ! BIRD When you 're ready to be honest with me , pay me another visit . ( He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number ) HAMMER Ben ? Come right over to Harry Bird 's office , will you ? ( He hangs up , and for a moment studies his left hand and three unmanicured fingers . He starts the pianola . After a moment or two BEN MANHEIM , a man almost as old as HAMMER , comes up the stairs . There is something shy and great about this man who is nothing but a plain happy man with a home , a library , an expensive phonograph , many albums of music , a wife , and two children . There is even something youthful about him , a kind of concern and eagerness about all sorts of unimportant things , a generosity for them , and a humour concerning the surprises people get from one another . He scarcely glances at his old friend , and yet he knows HAMMER is both surprised and irritated , perhaps shocked . He remains standing , waiting for HAMMER to acknowledge his presence . HAMMER turns off the pianola . Suddenly ) HAMMER Ben , what about this son of a bitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I understand him . A few minutes ago I thought he and I were going to be great friends  --  father and son almost  --  and do you know what he told me ? p. 12 MANHEIM If you 'll tell me what you told him , I think I can guess what be told you . HAMMER Do you really think you know him ? MANHEIM Well , maybe not . What did you tell him ? HAMMER I told him to write my story  --  and I 'd pay him anything he liked . I told him  --  well  --  I told him he was my son , if any man in the world was . MANHEIM He knew you were n't telling the truth , boss . HAMMER ( Swiftly , with anger ) Just a moment , Ben . You know things I do n't know and you understand things I do n't understand . But do n't be so sure of yourself all the time . How do you know I was n't telling the truth ? It so happens I was . MANHEIM I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boss all the time . You 've known me long enough to call me by my name . MANHEIM It 's been a long time since you 've wanted me to call you by your name , but I 'll do it until you ask me not to . HAMMER ( Gently ) From now on , Ben , when we 're alone please be good enough to call me by my name . p. 13 MANHEIM ( Smiling ) All right , Patrick . ( HAMMER looks at MANHEIM ) HAMMER Now , tell me about this maniac . Why ca n't I get along with him ? MANHEIM I 'm afraid he does n't trust you . HAMMER So what ? What if he does n't trust me ? He 's a crook himself , I 'm an amateur beside him . I do n't say he ca n't write , but besides being able to write , the son of a bitch understands things . He 's from the streets . Writers ought to come from good homes . From pleasant people who respect one another , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three weeks I 've dropped everything for him , but it just does n't seem to work . ( Pause ) Ben , do you think I ought to forget the whole thing ? MANHEIM Yes , Patrick , I honestly think you should . HAMMER Why ? MANHEIM Because he 'll make trouble . HAMMER ( Reflecting ) Yes , I think you 're right . I 'll forget the whole thing . It 's too much for me . I 'm too old , and he 's too young . And too swift . What makes him so swift ? MANHEIM Being right , I suppose . p. 14 HAMMER Am I slow ? MANHEIM No , Patrick , you 're still swifter than anybody else I know . HAMMER Am I wrong ? MANHEIM No . HAMMER I 'm right ? MANHEIM Not quite , but not wrong , either . He 's just right . HAMMER ( Furious ) How the hell do you know ? MANHEIM Well , Patrick , if he is n't right , whoever writes his books is . He has a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he does it to get everything more deeply right than it would be otherwise . And I guess he does it to be amusing . HAMMER Amusing to who ! He 's not amusing to me . He 's vulgar , he 's unkind , he talks around in circles , he jumps from one thing to another . I do n't find him amusing at all . Who 's he amusing to ? MANHEIM To a number of people who move around with him . HAMMER What people ? I 've never seen him , except he was alone . He 's got no business manager , no agent , no friend . What people ? MANHEIM Mostly dead people . p. 15 HAMMER Ben , what the hell are you talking about ? MANHEIM Well , to begin with , you 'll remember I urged you not to get him to come here . I did n't want him to come here for his sake as well as for yours . And mine , too , for that matter . But you insisted . I knew he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you call him , has made trouble everywhere he 's gone . I was pretty sure he 'd be the way he is , and that way is n't comfortable for any of us . Two weeks ago I handed him the story we bought from Joe Rogers for fifty thousand dollars and asked him to read it and let me know what he thought of it . Twenty minutes later he put the manuscript on my desk and said , Forget it . I told him we 'd paid fifty thousand dollars for that story . Even so , he said , forget it , the story 's no good . It 's dead . Yes , and it is dead . HAMMER He should have read the story before we bought it . MANHEIM We bought it two years ago . We 've spent another fifty thousand on it , trying to fix it up . Finally , we went back to the story Rogers sold us , but it 's no use , it 's just naturally dead , that 's all . HAMMER Who was it liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cohan , and he 's dead . HAMMER That son of a bitch . Where 's Rogers ? Let 's get him here at a thousand a week , keep him for ten weeks  --  ten thousand dollars  --  make him write another story  --  get us even . p. 16 MANHEIM He 's dead , too . HAMMER I did n't know that . Was n't Rogers a young man ? MANHEIM He was  --  thirty-nine . Heart attack . HAMMER That son of a bitch  --  well , junk the God damn story and forget it . Just forget it . I 'm getting old , that 's all . Find out where that guttersnipe is and get him back here . He 's around some place . In the Commissary , asking some waitress a lot of questions , or maybe in some star 's dressing-room , asking her all kinds of questions . ( MANHEIM lifts the telephone receiver . HAMMER slaps his hand ) Get away from that ! I could do that myself . Go out and find him , talk to him , bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Patrick . ( Pause ) HAMMER I 'm sorry too , Ben . ( He sighs ) I 'm old . Any time anybody does a thing like that to you , you ought to bust him in the mouth , the way you used to do when you were a kid . MANHEIM It 's all right , Patrick . I understand . And I 'm not a kid any more . HAMMER ( After a pause ) You do remember , then ? p. 17 MANHEIM I remember . HAMMER It 's a long , long time since we started out together in New York . ( Rubbing his mouth with his left hand ) I thought you 'd forgotten , Ben . I had n't , but I thought you had . MANHEIM Well , Patrick , I had n't remembered , either . I 'll go see if I can find him . HAMMER Wait  --  wait a minute , Ben . I do n't know what to tell him . Let me think a moment . ( He thinks ) What people ? MANHEIM What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him all the time . What people ? MANHEIM Well , they 're all kinds  --  poets , clowns , gamblers , fortune-tellers , saints , eccentrics . HAMMER You believe all that ? MANHEIM Yes , I do . HAMMER Are those people with you , too ? MANHEIM Not many of them  --  any more . There used to be a lot of them with me , but some I got rid of , and others just wandered away . They got tired of me . They 're all with him , though . HAMMER You really think he 's a great man , do n't you ? p. 18 MANHEIM No , but he 's trying . If you believe in people , you 've got to believe in anybody who 's trying . He can write . The best I can do is read . HAMMER Well , I ca n't write and I sure as hell wo n't read , but I 've built up this great organization , so who the hell is he ? They tell me pictures have had a greater influence on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no time at all , too . And I make more pictures than any other outfit in the world , and better ones . I 'm not trusting you alone , Ben . I believe everything you say about him , but he 's said the same things himself  --  in his own way , without saying anything at all most of the time , or talking about something else  --  about me getting my hands manicured . He got Rose the manicurist so excited , she could n't finish her work . These three fingers are n't manicured . Go out and find him , talk to him , bring him back  --  get him to write Ave Maria for me . MANHEIM ( Amused ) It 's not as serious as all that , Patrick . You 're just a little tired . Maybe you ought to take a rest . Go away for a month or two . Come back fresh . ( HAMMER stands suddenly . He begins to reach very high , as HARRY had done ) What are you doing that for ? HAMMER I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the platform ) p. 19 MANHEIM What 's the matter ? HAMMER I do n't need a rest  --  understand ? ( He jumps off the platform , lands heavily , looks at BEN ) Go get that son of a bitch . ( The curtain begins to come down ) He knows me , and I know him . I go around with a few people myself . CURTAIN p. 20 Act 1 , Scene 2 ACT ONEScene Two An hour later . HARRY BIRD is seated at a small desk in his office , tapping at a typewriter . The pianola is going strong . Up the steps comes SAM . SAM is a red-faced young man , probably Irish , who is always more than half-drunk , outwardly calm but in reality tense and nervous . He goes to the blackboard , erases the words , Who is Sam , stretches out on the divan . When the telephone rings SAM reaches over , lifts the receiver and very softly says , Yeah ? He listens a moment , then turns to HARRY . SAM Shut it off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HARRY shuts off the pianola ) Yeah  --  he 's here . ( Pause ) Tell him to come right up . ( He hangs up ) It 's the New York Times correspondent . He wants an interview . BIRD What did you tell him ? SAM I told him to come right up . BIRD ( Turns on the pianola ) Who told you to say that ? SAM A little more publicity wo n't do you any harm . Especially in New York . Besides , I get lonely . I like to see people . ( The telephone rings again . SAM answers it , listens a moment ) Who ? Betty Fitch ? ( Very calmly ) It 's a player-piano . ( Pause ) I do n't like it myself , Miss Fitch , but he likes it . ( Pause ) Yes , I know who you are . ( He listens ) Harry Bird  --  yes , ma'am . No , he 's not an actor , he 's a writer . My name is Sam  --  just Sam . ( Pause ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Harry , Betty Fitch does n't want you to play the piano any more . She 's trying to study a part . She 's a star , Harry  --  turn it off , will you ? p. 21 BIRD Hang up , Sam  --  just hang up . ( SAM hangs up , and stretches out . HARRY goes back to his typewriter . The telephone rings again . SAM reaches for it , but HARRY stops him . He lets the telephone ring three times , shuts off the piano , and then lifts the receiver ) Madam Hammer 's laundry . Good afternoon . ( He listens a moment , holds the receiver at arm 's length while an excited female voice screams along . When there is silence , HARRY speaks ) Excuse me , ma'am , could you repeat that ? I did n't quite get it . ( He holds the telephone at arm 's length and again the screaming is heard . When there is silence , he speaks again ) I 'm sorry , ma'am , but I just do n't seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , if it 's money you want , I 'm afraid you 're talking to the wrong man . This is Harry Bird . If you want romance , champagne , bright lights , and stuff like that , you 're still talking to the wrong man . But  --  if it 's immortality you want , you 're talking to the right man . ( The New York Times CORRESPONDENT comes in and stands by ) SAM Ah , come on now , do n't make her sore . What did she ever do to you ? BIRD ( With his hand over the mouthpiece ) She married that phoney from Bulgaria a year ago , did n't she ? What 's his name ? p. 22 SAM You mean Polikey Vitrolin ? BIRD Yeah  --  that 's the guy . Comes to this country with his polite manners , and marries one of our sweetest high-school girls for six months . ( Into the telephone ) Miss Fitch , you should never ought to have married that bad man from Bulgaria  --  a young innocent American girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CORRESPONDENT FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES Excuse me , Mr. Bird . I 'm the correspondent of the New York Times . ( He extends his hand to SAM ) SAM Wait a minute  --  BIRD Mr. Bird is a little tired . Even so , I 'm sure he 'll be glad to answer your questions . But please do n't ask him to get up . CORRESPONDENT FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES ( To SAM ) I can come back some other day , Mr. Bird , if you 're not feeling well . SAM ( Taking a swallow from a bottle ) I feel fine . BIRD Just draw up a chair , and make yourself at home ( CORRESPONDENT sits ) Mr. Bird , would you like some pianola music perhaps ? p. 23 SAM No , Sam  --  if it 's all the same to you , I 'd like some real piano music . BIRD You shall have real piano music . ( To the CORRESPONDENT ) Mr. Bird sometimes prefers pianola music  --  for its pathos and comedy , for its humble American majesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( He dials a number ) Music Department ? This is Harry Bird 's office . Mr. Bird would be deeply grateful if you would send your finest pianist to his office immediately , to play  --  a little Brahms , Mozart , Chopin . Yes  --  immediately , please . An old pianist or a young one  --  it does n't matter , but do n't send a dwarf or a Hindu  --  just somebody plain and skilful  --  no personality stuff . Yes  --  thank you . ( He hangs up ) Go ahead . Mr. Bird is ready for you . CORRESPONDENT FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES ( To SAM ) Well , Mr. Bird , it was n't easy to find your office , and I must say I did n't expect it to be quite so  --  well , shall we say , interesting ? SAM Sure  --  let 's say interesting . CORRESPONDENT FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES What are all these things around here for  --  atmosphere ? p. 24 SAM This room used to be where the studio photographed its stars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's an unusual office for a writer , but I suppose it 's what you want . SAM It 's comfortable . CORRESPONDENT FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES I see ( Pause ) Well , Mr. Bird , first , just what are your plans in the moving picture business ? SAM ( Wearily , dead-pan ) I intend to revolutionize the industry . CORRESPONDENT FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES I see . How do you intend to do it ? SAM By thinking clearly . Right now I 'm biding my time , but I study pictures every day . CORRESPONDENT FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES I see . What sort of pictures do you study ? SAM Old , silent pictures . CORRESPONDENT FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES Why are you studying them ? SAM Because I missed some of them when they came out . CORRESPONDENT FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES ( Making notes ) I see . ( Pause ) But the rumour around town is that you are going to write a story which has long been a favourite of Mr. Hammer 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ask Sam . CORRESPONDENT FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES ( Looking at HARRY ) And who is Sam , Mr. Bird ? Your agent ? BIRD No , I 'm Mr. Bird 's occasional drinking companion . We met at Tia Juana two years ago , and Mr. Bird was kind enough to remember me . SAM You were kind enough to remember me . I should find it very lonely here without a level-headed , comic , imaginative young man like you to keep me company now and then  --  not too often , though . Even brilliance can become tiresome . But tell the man about the rumour . BIRD Briefly , Mr. Bird feels that any favourite story of Mr. Hammer 's will have to be written by Mr. Hammer himself . CORRESPONDENT FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES I see . But only this morning The Daily Reporter ran a story to the effect that Mr. Bird , after three weeks of motion picture study , was now ready to go to work on an untitled story based on some themes and ideas of Mr. Hammer 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( At the window ) There goes Mark Spencer again ! ( Shouting ) Hi-ya , Mark !

BIRD No , I have n't met him in person , but I 've seen him in a lot of pictures at neighbourhood theatres . If I was famous and somebody I did n't know hollered out to me , Hi-ya , Sam , I think I 'd holler back . Would n't you ? CORRESPONDENT FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES Yes , I believe I would , although I 'm not sure . I 'm not famous . Perhaps Mr. Bird can answer your question , Sam . BIRD How about it , Mr. Bird ? Would you holler back ? SAM If I was famous , I 'd cut my throat . CORRESPONDENT FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES But , Mr. Bird , you are famous . SAM Do n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as I can . CORRESPONDENT FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES Interview Sam , Mr. Bird ? SAM Sure  --  sure . He 's not a writer , but he 's got an opinion or two about anything  --  the same as anybody else . Go ahead , ask him something . He 'll give you a good answer . CORRESPONDENT FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES ( Unsure ) I see . Well , Sam , how long have you known Mr. Bird ? p. 27 BIRD As I said , the first time I met him was about two years ago at Tia Juana just after the fifth race . He 'd won three hundred dollars on a long-shot named Blackrock , I believe , and he asked if I could use twenty dollars . I could , but I would n't . He then asked if I had a good horse in the next race , and I did n't . We 've been friends ever since .

Well , Sam , how does it feel to have a famous writer for a friend ? BIRD ( Taking bottle from SAM for a swig ) The same as having anybody else for a friend . Go ahead , Mr. Bird , take a sip . SAM Thank you , Sam . ( SAM takes a swig ) CORRESPONDENT FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES Well , Mr. Bird , how does it feel to have Sam for a friend ? SAM I have never pushed the matter to the point of friendship . A friend is taken to mean somebody who will do something for you . I do n't want anybody to do anything for me , and I know Sam would n't let anybody do anything for him . BIRD ( At the window ) Wait a minute  --  here comes somebody who looks like somebody . Come on , take a look at her . ( The CORRESPONDENT goes to the window ) Come on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you good . ( SAM gets up and goes to the window ) Who is that girl ? p. 28 CORRESPONDENT FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES Nobody , most likely  --  looks like an extra . BIRD You mean a girl that beautiful is only an extra ? SAM If she 's that beautiful , she 's an extra . BIRD Well , look at that , will you ? Probably from Cincinnati . SAM They do n't all come from Cincinnati . BIRD Most of them do . ( Suddenly , loudly , leaning out of the window ) Hey !  --  You ! GIRL 'S VOICE Who  --  me ? BIRD Yes  --  you . You 're from Cincinnati , are n't you ? GIRL 'S VOICE No , I 'm from Montana . Great Falls . BIRD ( To the PIANIST , a small man , who has just come up the stairs ) She 's from Great Falls . ( Shouting , to the girl ) What 's your name ? GIRL 'S VOICE Martha Harper . BIRD ( To PIANIST ) Martha Harper  --  you never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Out the window , to the girl ) Well , Martha , good luck . You 're going to be great . ( He waves ) p. 29 GIRL 'S VOICE Are you a producer ? I want to meet a producer . ( HARRY points to the piano . The PIANIST goes to the piano , sits down , adjusts some music before him , and begins to play Brahms : the Double Concerto . The telephone rings . SAM goes over and answers it . HARRY leans out the window ) SAM ( On telephone ) Yeah . ( He listens ) I 'm sorry , Miss Fitch  --  but what you are now hearing is Brahms . It is positively not a machine . There is a small man here seated at the piano , and it 's him . ( He hangs up ) GIRL 'S VOICE I want to know a producer . I 'd like him to be a young producer , but if I ca n't meet a young one , I guess I 'll just have to be satisfied with an old one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the love of God , come on up . CORRESPONDENT FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES ( To SAM ) But , Mr Bird , do n't you think Sam ought to be a little more  --  SAM No , no  --  Sam 's all right . BIRD ( Looking down the stairs ) Here she comes . Look at her . ( With delight ) There you are . Come right up now . One step at a time . Up you go ! Come on , Martha Harper . ( The girl comes up the stairs . HARRY stands back , admiring her . She 's in a classic costume , and very pretty . HARRY puts his arms around her and kisses her ) p. 30 HARPER You are a producer ! What 's your name ? BIRD My name is Harry Bird . ( The CORRESPONDENT looks from HARRY to SAM , confused ) I do n't generally tell my name to young girls from Great Falls , Montana , who want to be in pictures  --  but I 'm afraid I must tell you . ( Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go around looking for producers ? HARPER Oh , I 'm ready for them . If that 's the way to get in pictures , I 'm going to do it . I 've made up my mind . BIRD ( Swiftly ) The interview is over . Sam ! Herr Brahms ! ( The man at the piano stops playing ) If you do n't mind , I 'd like to have a few minutes with Miss Harper alone . ( He points to the steps going down ) HARPER But I like music . Ca n't he go on playing ? ( SAM takes the CORRESPONDENT by the arm to the head of the stairway . They are met by MISS FITCH coming up ) FITCH Oh , there you are  --  you , you  --  ! SAM He 's not Harry Bird . This is the correspondent of the New York Times . p. 31 FITCH Oh , so you 're Mr. Bird ? SAM Now , wait a minute . FITCH Well , listen to me , Mr. Bird , you 've got to stop that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is my office , and Mr. Hammer himself told me to listen to the piano as much as I like  --  to inspire me . FITCH Inspire you ? What about me ? Inspire you to do what ? SAM To write philosophical things . FITCH Philosophical ? SAM That 's right . Have you ever stopped to think , Miss Fitch , how wonderful the human body is just from the point of view of plumbing ? FITCH Plumbing ? What are you trying to do , kid me ? SAM I would n't think of it . Mr. Hammer wants me to get inspired and write him a great story . I 'm doing my best . A piano helps me . FITCH Well , it does n't help me  --  all day long . All  --  day  --  long . I 'm going crazy . HARPER Excuse me , Miss Fitch , could I have your autograph ? FITCH ( Graciously , but phoney ) Of course . May I have a pen , please ? p. 32 SAM Wo n't a pencil do ? ( The CORRESPONDENT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impatient , to SAM and the CORRESPONDENT ) All right , give me a piece of paper to autograph on , will you ? What are you waiting for ? HARPER Excuse me , Miss Fitch . Could you autograph on me instead of on a piece of paper ? FITCH On you ? HARPER ( Lowering her waist ) Yes . Right here . Over my heart . I 'll put some scotch tape over it when I take a bath so it wo n't come off . Please , Miss Fitch , I 've worshipped you from afar . FITCH Well  --  all right . ( She begins to write her name on MARTHA , but the pen is bad and she has to shake it several times ) BIRD Easy there , Miss Fitch , if you please . Do n't hurt her . She 's flesh and blood just like anybody else . FITCH I 'm not hurting her . ( Writing ) Autographs , autographs  --  you 'd think people would have a little consideration for the thoughts and moods of others . p. 33 SAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts and moods ! SAM Oh . BIRD ( To MARTHA , who is showing him BETTY FITCH 's autograph ) It 's very pretty , Martha . ( The PIANIST is eager to see ) Here , show it to him , too . ( The PIANIST looks ) Pretty , is n't it ? PIANIST Prettiest I ever saw . ( He goes right on playing ) HARPER I 'll never wash it off . FITCH ( To SAM ) For one moment at least , will you be good enough to ask that man at the piano to stop ? SAM But , Miss Fitch , I 'm trying to become inspired , so I can think philosophical thoughts . What kind of thoughts do you think ? FITCH ( Seriously ) I think philosophical thoughts , too . SAM You do ? FITCH Like , Who am I ? Why did it have to be me ? Where did I come from ? SAM You 're from Cincinnati , are n't you ? p. 34 FITCH ( With contempt ) Cincinnati ? ( Proudly ) I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're from . FITCH I do n't mean like that , from cities . I mean , from what have I come , to what am I going ? You know what I mean , do n't you ? SAM Yes , I sure do . A man like me who 's paid a lot of money to get inspired and write philosophical things has got to understand a girl like you , Miss Fitch , or get out of the business . ( BEN MANHEIM comes up the stairs . He stands a moment , looking around ) FITCH ( Bitterly , swiftly ) I 've got to talk to you , Mr. Manheim , about this lousy part they 're trying to push down my throat in Danger Street . MANHEIM ( Gently ) Some other time , please . FITCH ( Furious , almost screaming ) Well , I do n't like the part , see ? And I wo n't do it , that 's all . I 'll break my contract . SAM ( Taking her by the arm , and going down the steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the man for ? What difference does it make what part you get ? You 're a great actress . p. 35 CORRESPONDENT FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES ( Following them ) But , Mr. Bird , what about our interview ? What am I going to tell the New York Times ? MANHEIM Harry , if you do n't mind , I 'd like to have a little of your time  --  alone . BIRD I do n't mind . We 're alone enough . ( Of the PIANIST ) Let him play . ( to the PIANIST ) Play a lot of things . She likes it . What else have you brought along ? PIANIST I 've got some Chopin . BIRD Play some of that ( To MANHEIM ) Sit down . This girl 's from Great Falls , Montana . She 's looking for a young producer . Her name 's Martha Harper . MANHEIM How do you do ? HARPER ( Moving towards MANHEIM ) Are you a producer ? BIRD Here , Martha . Stretch out on this divan , and listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and admires her , while BEN MANHEIM watches ) She just had Miss Fitch autograph her body . Want to see it ? MANHEIM No , I do n't believe I do . p. 36 BIRD It 's very pretty . HARPER Is it really pretty ? ( She pushes down her shirt . The PIANIST turns to watch ) It 's upside down for me ( She spells the name ) B-e-t-t-y , Betty , F-i-t-c-h , Fitch . Betty Fitch ! BIRD ( Over to one side , while MARTHA listens to the music ) Oh , thou most beautiful among women  --  MANHEIM ( Softly ) You should n't be cruel , Harry . BIRD I 'm not being cruel . MANHEIM It 's not easy to believe you 'd make fun of an unfortunate girl . BIRD I 'm not making fun of her . I do n't think you understand . MANHEIM If there 's anything to understand , I 'm afraid I do n't . BIRD Well , briefly , there 's the story . MANHEIM Ave Maria ? BIRD Yes . MANHEIM But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a kid from Great Falls , Montana . I met her five minutes ago . She was walking down the company street . I 'm going to write the story  --  but only for her . p. 37 MANHEIM But Mr. Hammer wants Margaret Corrigan for the girl . BIRD Margaret Corrigan ? Who 's she ? MANHEIM One of our actresses . Mr. Hammer wants to introduce her to the public in Ave Maria . BIRD ( Shaking his head ) No  --  nothing doing  --  MANHEIM You mean you 'll write the story if this girl gets the part ? BIRD That 's exactly what I mean . MANHEIM Have you got a story ? BIRD I have . ( He looks at the girl )  --  Now . MANHEIM ( Looking at the girl , then at HARRY ) Harry , you 're not  --  ? BIRD No , no  --  do n't offend me . I do n't want anything from her . But there she is  --  for everybody . She 's no whore yet , but she 's about to become one . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful , idiotic innocence and love , though . MANHEIM But Mr. Hammer expects the story to be inspirational  --  religious , even . BIRD The story is going to be inspirational , as you say  --  and religious , too . Not because Mr. Hammer expects it to be , but because there 's no other way to look at anything . What could you do but love her ? Could you mock her ? Make little of her spirit 's littleness ? Laugh at her fool 's blessed heart ? p. 38 MANHEIM Are you sure , Harry , you 're not having fun  --  from being bored ? BIRD I am having fun , but not from being bored . For the first time since I 've been out here , I 'm delighted . I 've found a woman who 's innocent . MANHEIM I ca n't believe you 're not serious , and I ca n't believe you are . BIRD I am serious . MANHEIM But this poor girl . Let 's be honest . She 's ordinary . She 's a common , everyday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben . She 's a woman . If we call her names , it 's still herself we mean . MANHEIM There 's a million girls like this girl , Harry . BIRD There 's more than a million like her . There 's none unlike her , and she is like the others most . She is their best beauty , their awfulest inconsequence , their most gathered glory . MANHEIM Are n't you giving her just a little too much importance ? BIRD I am not , even though it is the function of art to give all things more importance than it would seem they deserve at first . She can not be given too much importance . She is the mother of everybody . p. 39 PIANIST What 'll I play now ? BIRD Try Ave Maria . PIANIST Schubert or Gounod ? BIRD Schubert first , then Gounod . PIANIST O.K. ( He begins to play Schubert 's Ave Maria ) BIRD ( Slowly , moving towards MARTHA ) Hail Mary . Full of grace . The Lord is with thee . Blessed art thou , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us sinners now and at the hour of our death . Amen . HARPER What did you say ? BIRD I said , How do you like it out here in California ? HARPER Oh , I like it fine . BIRD How old are you , Martha ? HARPER Nineteen . BIRD When did you first go with a man ? Do you understand ? HARPER Oh , I understand all right . MANHEIM ( Objecting sincerely ) Harry , you 've got no right  --  BIRD ( Stopping him ) Wait a minute , Ben . p. 40 HARPER If I tell you , will you give me a job in pictures ? BIRD Yes , I promise . HARPER Will I be a star ? BIRD Yes , you will . HARPER You 're not fooling me , are you ? I thought producers wanted more than answers to questions . But I do n't care what they want . I 'll give it to them , just so I can be a star . BIRD I 'm not fooling you . HARPER I guess I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think this has gone far enough . BIRD ( Swiftly , turning ) I 'm sorry , Ben . But you do n't understand . HARPER What 's the matter ? BIRD Martha , I ask you humbly to forgive me . HARPER Oh , it 's all right . It was so long ago . But I did n't know anything , then . MANHEIM ( Bitterly ) You 're lying ! You 're lying ! HARPER ( To HARRY ) I 'm not lying . I was eleven . Will you put me in pictures ? p. 41 MANHEIM ( Deeply hurt ) I do n't believe you . I do n't believe a word you 've said . You 're a mischievous , ambitious young girl . ( He brings all the currency out of his wallet ) I want you to go home . Here 's money . Take it and go home . HARPER You mean to my room at the Studio Club ? MANHEIM I mean to Great Falls , Montana . Here , take the money . HARPER I have no home in Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere . Do n't stay here . HARPER But I want to be in pictures . MANHEIM ( Turning to HARRY ) You 're not going to be taken in by this girl 's incredible performance , are you ? Look at her . Anybody can see no man in the world has touched her  --  yet . And it would make me most unhappy if anyone I knew touched her . HARPER What 's the matter with me ? I went to a doctor last week  --  BIRD ( Swiftly ) Did he make love to you ? MANHEIM ( Almost insane with rage ) You 've got to stop asking these ugly and unkind questions . I wo n't allow it . You know very well the girl is not telling the truth . I 'm not a young man and it 's a long time since I raised a hand against another , but if you ask this girl another question I swear  --  p. 42 BIRD Take it easy , Ben . I know . You 've got a daughter of your own about her age . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it , so that he is not touched . MANHEIM loses his balance and falls . HARRY helps him up . MANHEIM is terribly shaken and embarrassed . ) HARPER What 's the matter ? BIRD I 'm sorry , Ben . MANHEIM ( Almost unable to speak ) It 's all right . I think I 'd better go now . BIRD No  --  wait . ( Pause , earnestly ) I want to write the story . ( Pause ) Even so , I 'll not tell Mr. Hammer . MANHEIM I understand . Thanks very much . ( Pause ) I 'll tell him . Will you be here awhile ? Mr. Hammer may want to have another talk with you . BIRD I 'll wait till I hear from you . ( MANHEIM goes . There is a long pause , during which HARRY looks at MARTHA , almost embarrassed , and she at him ) HARPER ( With effort ) Who was that man ? BIRD ( His voice bushed ) Ben Manheim . He 's the First Assistant to Mr. Hammer . p. 43 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who started this institution . HARPER Oh . ( Pause ) Am I really going to be in pictures ? BIRD Yes , you are . HARPER Then , I sure would like to meet a famous actor . BIRD ( He walks around , troubled . He looks at her strangely . He speaks swiftly and terribly ) Now ! Why did you lie to me ? HARPER ( Swiftly , defensively ) I did n't lie . BIRD ( Touching the PIANIST 's shoulder ) O.K. , that 's all . Thanks a lot . ( He waits for the PIANIST to go ) You can stop acting now . Why did you lie ? HARPER ( Embarrassed ) I do n't know . BIRD Why did you ask Miss Fitch to autograph you , instead of a piece of paper ? HARPER Because I knew she 'd do it , out of ridiculous and pathetic pride . Because she 's been made inhuman and vulgar by her cheap fame . BIRD Why did you pretend to be stupid ? p. 44 HARPER You wanted me to be stupid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I were stupid , you had no right to be , too . I had to be stupid because ( Pause ) BIRD Yes ? HARPER Because I was so eager for you to know me . ( Pause ) I know from your writing that you ought to know me . BIRD You know my writing ? HARPER Yes , I do . You 're not a bad writer . You ought n't to be cruel . BIRD I 'm not always cruel . HARPER You were cruel to me . I suppose almost everybody you meet is cruel , but that 's no excuse for you . You 're still young enough to have fun , but you 're never so young you can have the kind of fun that hurts others . ( Pause ) You ought to be ashamed . BIRD ( Quietly , seriously ) I am . Is there anything I can do ? HARPER Nothing . Now . ( She prepares to go ) But I am sorry about Mr. Manheim . BIRD Then why did n't you tell him the truth ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he did n't really believe he was right . If I told him the truth , he would despise me even more than her . BIRD Her ? Who ? HARPER The Woman . Oh , I could be her . I could play that part . ( Pause ) It 's a pity I 'm not going to . BIRD Why not ? HARPER I 'm not going to play the part because I do n't think you can write it . I 'm sorry if you 're hurt . Good-bye . ( She begins to go ) BIRD ( Almost shouting ) Hurt ? What the hell are you talking about ? Nothing can hurt me . Wait a minute  --  what do you mean I ca n't write it ? ( He stands at the head of the steps ) I can write anything , and better than anybody else in the world . ( The downstairs door closes . HARRY hurries to the window ) Now listen , you  --  I admit I was a fool . But that 's finished . ( He begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to try to find you . But I 'm asking you to come back  --  ( Pause ) O.K. So long . ( Softly ) And go to hell . ( He turns away from the window , troubled and amazed . He starts the pianola . The telephone rings , but he refuses to answer it . At last he sits down wearily , and after a moment buries his face in his hands . HAMMER and MANHEIM come into the room . He does n't look up until HAMMER speaks ) p. 46 HAMMER My boy  --  my boy ! Ben 's told me the good news . Let me shake your hand . BIRD O.K. , shake it . ( He thrusts out his hand , but does not get up . HAMMER refuses to take his hand ) HAMMER What 's the matter ? ( He shuts off the pianola ) Now , what 's the matter , Harry ? You can tell me . BIRD ( Wearily ) I want to write the story  --  HAMMER Yes  --  Ben told me  --  and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everything  --  BIRD ( Stands ) Thanks  --  I want to write the story , but I know I ca n't . HAMMER Why not ? BIRD ( Angry ) I just do n't understand things well enough . I need more time . Later , maybe . HAMMER You mean a week ? BIRD I mean five years  --  maybe ten . ( He begins to throw darts idly , while HAMMER and MANHEIM watch ) HAMMER ( Whispering ) In ten years I 'll be seventy-three years old . ( HAMMER throws a dart . Then MANHEIM throws one . MARTHA comes in . HARRY turns , sees her , and without a word goes to her . He stands about three paces from her , looking at her , amazed and delighted . MANHEIM turns and watches , too . MANHEIM and HAMMER look at one another . MARTHA moves to HARRY . She stands very close to him , then leans forward and very slowly kisses him . HARRY puts his arms around her , and the curtain begins to come down ) @x The time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell . As it rises , HAMMER says : HAMMER Is that one of our stars , or an extra ? Who is that girl ? ( HARRY and MARTHA stand apart , looking at one another . HAMMER goes over to them ) Let me give you some advice , young woman . If you think the way to get into pictures is to throw yourself at a writer or a producer , you 're sadly mistaken . That procedure went out with silent pictures . Making moving pictures is not only a big business , it is an important art , with tremendous responsibilities . Responsibilities to the country at large , and to all of its people , without regard for race , colour , or creed . Responsibilities to men , women , and children  --  and , yes  --  to generations still unborn . The very first need of this industry is stories , and where do stories come from ? They come from writers . ( The curtain begins to come down ) What do you mean coming in here and kissing this writer ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to go to work ? ( The curtain is down . Almost instantly it rises again . MARTHA is standing alone on the platform , HAMMER has one foot on the first step of the platform , and is talking to her . BEN MANHEIM is watching , a little confused . HARRY BIRD is walking to MARTHA . HAMMER continues ) I know what a temptation it is for a pretty girl to sell her body for a chance at fame and fortune , but there are other writers . ( The curtain begins to fall again . HARRY BIRD is on the platform , beside MARTHA ) p. 49 BIRD ( Almost comically ) Ah , shut up . ( The curtain is down . Almost instantly it rises again , and now BEN MANHEIM is talking to HAMMER , as if he were trying to keep a good fellow out of a street brawl ) MANHEIM You 're wasting your breath , Patrick . Come on , let 's go back to your office . HAMMER Go back to my office ? Why ? Who is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see MARTHA . He shouts ) Who are you ? HARPER My name is Martha Harper . I want to be in pictures . I do n't care how I get in , or what I have to do . All I want is fame and money . I want people to point at me as I pass by . I want little children to run after my automobile . I do n't care what I have to do . I 'll do it . ( To HARRY , softly ) Do you want to know me ? BIRD I do know you , and I want you to know me . Go change your clothes and come right back . We 're going on a trip . ( She goes . The curtain begins to come down ) HAMMER ( To MANHEIM , as if he were deaf ) What did she say ? Now , Ben , get the hell out of my way and let me talk to Harry . ( MANHEIM and HAMMER begin to struggle . The curtain is down . It rises almost instantly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BIRD is printing the last two letters of Ave Maria on the blackboard , and SAM comes in with his hand over his left eye ) p. 50 SAM ( To HARRY ) That ridiculous actress Betty Fitch hit me in the eye . ( He goes to the water jar , moistens his handkerchief and puts it over his eye ) BIRD Whoever told you cold water is good for a black eye ? SAM Nobody , but I have n't got anything else to put on it . What are these boys wrestling about ? BIRD About the future of the American moving picture . SAM ( With bottle ) I never saw a woman with so many phoney ideas . ( SAM takes a swig ) She says she 's going to have me arrested . ( MANHEIM and HAMMER stop wrestling ) BIRD What do you mean ? You did n't try anything funny on her , did you ? SAM It was n't funny . I ca n't resist a phoney woman . They do something to me . I sat around for ten minutes talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as I could take it . There 's nothing in her dressing-room but a wonderful pink couch . What else could I do ? What would you do ? HAMMER Excuse me , young man . I do n't know who you are , or what you 've been up to , but if you 're a friend of Mr. Bird 's , I 'll protect you . Harry 's going to write a great story for me and I do n't want anything to interfere with his work . Who is it you 've attacked ? p. 51 SAM You excuse me . I do n't know who you are , or what you 've been up to . I made a pass at that ridiculous woman , because I thought she was troubled and lonely , and expected me to . ( To HARRY ) Who is this  --  whipper-snapper ? BIRD What do you mean who is he ? He 's one of the boys . He 's got a stable of horses . You 've bet on the Ave horses , have n't you ? Ave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's his old secretary . Ave Ogelthorpe . That 's the young producer who committed suicide last year  --  you know , the genius . SAM Is this Patrick Hammer ? BIRD Sure . That 's what I 've been trying to tell you . Ave Dublin . That 's where he was born . Ave New York . I do n't know what that stands for . SAM I know the horses . Ave Money . There 's one of the fastest three-year-olds in the country , Mr. Hammer . I 've followed your horses a good long time , and I 've made money on them , too . I caught Ave Mother when she paid twenty to one at Pimlico . It was the Saturday before Mother 's Day . It was just a hunch bet  --  ten across  --  but I got a potful of money . That race was n't framed , was it ? HAMMER Thoroughbred horses are only a hobby with me . I have nothing to do with their training or running . p. 52 SAM How come ? I thought you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betting . HAMMER I sometimes make a small wager on one of my horses . SAM Did you have anything on Ave Mother that time she paid twenty to one ? HAMMER I do n't see how it 's any business of yours , but since you 're a friend of Mr. Bird 's  --  yes , I did . SAM How much ? HAMMER A thousand dollars . SAM Track odds ? HAMMER Yes , track odds . SAM Man , that 's a lot of money  --  twenty thousand dollars for one thousand . You sure can pick them . HAMMER I 'm partial to my own horses , and especially partial to the ones that seem to be coming into their best form . SAM Sure  --  sure . But that lousy Ave Truth was a no-good if I ever heard of one . Did he ever win a race ? HAMMER Yes , he did  --  once . SAM How much did he pay ? HAMMER About thirty to one . p. 53 SAM What ever happened to him ? HAMMER I sold him for nine thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was destroyed . SAM By God , it takes a smart man to know how to make money at a hobby , does n't it ? ( The curtain begins to come down ) HAMMER Horse races are pure luck . I 've been a lucky man all my life . ( The curtain is down . It rises almost immediately . HAMMER is trying to talk to HARRY , who has just started the pianola ) Now , Harry , about this girl  --  I know how it is with a young man , and I say God bless you and more power to you  --  but this is no time to let anything interfere with your work . Beautiful girls are a dime a dozen . I 'll get you all you want . But first write the story . O.K. ? BIRD I 'm driving home to San Francisco to-night . ( Pause ) It 'll take me about two weeks to write the story . HAMMER That 's a good boy . I can truthfully say I love you , Harry . I 'll have Murphy draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want ? BIRD I do n't want any advance . HAMMER No advance ? What do you mean ? Take ten thousand anyway  --  for expenses . p. 54 BIRD My expenses at home are about a dollar a day . At that rate , I 've got enough for three years . HAMMER But we 've got to have a contract , Harry . BIRD Why ? HAMMER We always have a contract . We do n't ask writers to write for nothing . We pay them , and we pay them well . BIRD I do n't need any money to write . HAMMER Take the money , Harry . Listen to me . Take it . I 'll get Murphy to draw up a contract immediately . BIRD No , thanks . I 'll just go home and write the story . If it 's good  --  if I like it  --  I 'll send it down . Then if you like it , I 'll talk to you about it . HAMMER Talk about what , Harry ? BIRD About how much I 'm willing to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and direct it  --  about who is to appear in it . HAMMER Now , Harry , let me get Murphy to draw up a contract right here and now , while we 're all enthusiastic . BIRD I 'm not enthusiastic . I just want to go home and write the story . HAMMER Harry , do n't think I 'm not grateful to you for your honesty . You have n't allowed us to pay you one cent for the three weeks that you 've been here . Time is money , and a writer 's time is a lot of money . I know you would n't let yourself take something for nothing , and I appreciate and respect the way you feel . But now , Harry  --  now that you 're going to go to work and write the story  --  let me hand you a cheque for ten thousand dollars  --  fifteen  --  twenty  --  or twenty-five , even . I 'm an old gambler , and I know when I 've got a sure thing . I 'll bet my life you write a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gambler myself . You 'll be seeing me in two or three weeks . ( He moves to go ) HAMMER Now , wait a minute , Harry . Let 's get this thing straight . BIRD It 's straight now . I 'm not going to write the story for you . I 'm going to write it for myself . You do n't have to risk a penny of your money . I promise to offer you the story first , but you wo n't have to take it  --  HAMMER You 're being unfair , Harry . The story is my idea . Even my horses are named Ave . BIRD Yeah . Ave Money . HAMMER Look at any scratch sheet . What kind of names do you read ? Crazy . Why should n't the names of my horses be crazy , too ? You ca n't go off this way , with nothing settled . I 'm part of Ave Maria . BIRD You write your story . I 'm going home to write mine . HAMMER ( Severe and bitter ) Just a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be nice  --  if you 're trying to hurt me  --  do n't forget that I can be as dirty as you can . Dirtier . For three long weeks I 've tried to get along with you . I 've humoured you . I 've let you have your way . I 've given you this office and privileges I do n't give anybody else . I 've had old silent pictures flown out from New York for you in special aeroplanes . I 've searched all over the country for a baby grand pianola . What for ? I do n't know . But now , if you 're not going to be nice , I 'll give you a performance you wo n't forget as long as you live . I come from the streets , too . Do n't think I 'm no match for you . ( Pause ) I do n't like talking to you this way , Harry , because I know you 're a genius , but you could be the world 's greatest genius , and I still would n't give a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one on me . ( Gently ) Let bygones be bygones , no hard feelings , and I 'll telephone Murphy to come right over with a contract . It 'll take only a few minutes . ( He moves towards HARRY with his hand extended . He is smiling . HARRY takes his hand ) My boy , I 'm glad you 're going to be with us . Let me be the first to welcome you . ( HARRY releases HAMMER 's hand ) p. 56 BIRD Get away , old man ! Get away ! HAMMER ( Infuriated ) Now listen , you guttersnipe . Listen to me , before you go . BIRD ( Singing ) For an old man he is oldAnd an old man he is grey ( MARTHA , in her street clothes , comes in . HARRY embraces her , and speaks the following lines ) But a young man 's heart is full of loveGet away , old man , get away.We 're going to Mexico , Martha . We 'll get married in Tia Juana . See you around , Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARTHA ) HAMMER Stop him ! Ben , stop him , will you ? Go after him ! He likes you ! Do n't let him get away ! Go get him . This is no time to go to Mexico . Ben , what are you standing there for ? MANHEIM ( Seriously troubled ) It 's no use , Patrick . Let him go . I 've been wrong about him all the time . He 's no good . Forget the whole thing . HAMMER No , Ben . I 'll go get him myself . ( He begins to go . He stops at the steps , turns suddenly to SAM ) I do n't know who you are , but if you can get him to go home and write the story , I 'll give you anything you want . Anything . p. 57 SAM What will you give me ? HAMMER I 'll give you a long-shot at Narragansett to-morrow . He 'll be at least twenty to one . SAM Twenty to one is n't enough , because I 've only got fourteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-shot and a hundred dollars . SAM O.K. What 's the horse ? HAMMER Get him to go home and start writing the story and I 'll give you the horse . SAM I do n't trust you . HAMMER All right . The horse is Ave Mother again . She has n't been in the money in seven starts . She 's going to win to-morrow . Now , go get him . ( He hands SAM a hundred-dollar bill ) SAM ( Going ) I do n't know why you should trust me . I did n't trust you . Go get him yourself . He 's my friend and I never interfere in the personal affairs of my friends . ( He throws the money at HAMMER , and goes ) HAMMER ( Screaming ) I lied to you ! Ave Mother is n't going to win . I lied , I lied ! SAM ( Going ) I 'll take a chance . p. 58 HAMMER ( Almost pathetically ) Well , Ben , they 've beat me . I 'm beat . I 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a mess I 'd drop everything and go back to Dublin and die . That 's where I want to be . That 's where I started and that 's where I want to end . I tried my best . All my life I tried my best . But it 's no use . I ca n't get good things out of myself , and I ca n't get them out of others . Get away , he told me . Get away , old man . Think of it ! Get away  --  to me . I 'm tired now . I 'm beat . ( Pause ) Ben , what do you remember about your earliest years ? MANHEIM ( Pause , slowly ) I remember not getting enough to eat . I remember getting pushed around , and then turning and pushing others around . Because they pushed me . ( Pause ) Why ? HAMMER Oh , nothing . ( Quietly ) I remember things like that , too , Ben , but I remember other things , too , I remember a girl in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone more beautiful , more like an angel . I worshipped her . I kissed the door of her house late at night , getting up from bed to run there . One day I came face to face with her in the street . I was eight or nine , I guess , and so was she . I was so surprised to see her , so surprised to be seen by her , I stopped walking . I could n't move . I could n't breathe . All I could do was stare at her coming down the street towards me . I wanted to say something , but I could n't think of anything to say . I do n't know why I did it , but I began to whisper to her , Ave Maria , full of grace , the Lord is with thee She stopped and looked at me , and I believed she saw me  --  really saw me . I believed she loved me . I wanted nothing more of the world , nothing more of life , than to worship her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's all I wanted , Ben . That 's all I 've ever wanted . ( Pause ) Then she spit at me ! ( He buries his head in his hands , and after a moment lifts it ) I ran home . I went to my room and locked the door . ( Pause , quietly with anguish ) I did n't leave the house for a month . I did n't want to go anywhere . I was afraid of the world . I was afraid of its people . My family could n't understand . I could n't tell them . They brought doctors and priests to talk to me , to pray for me . They thought I was going to die . ( Pause ) My poor mother 's secret tears  --  my poor father 's silent grief  --  These are things I can never forgive the world . A month is a long time  --  a month of sorrow is a long , long time for a boy . They were not wrong in fearing that I would die . I did die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had put a knife in my heart . It would have been better for me to die in my body as well as in my heart , but I would not die . In my body I would stay among them  --  to pay them back for the tears of my mother . Slowly , quietly , steadily  --  for the grief of my father . I 'll pay them back . I 'll stay alive to pay them back. And I have paid them back . Their loveliest came to me as though I were a prince . They came not for the good in myself  --  not to restore what they had murdered . They came humiliated , seeking my favour . In my heart I spit at them  --  for the shame of their purposes  --  their women hating me and pretending in their nakedness to love me . They are the ugly , Ben , not I. I have never been fooled by them . I took their mothers before they bore children or went to the marriage bed . p. 59 MANHEIM ( Sincerely ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are , Ben  --  they are . I must tell you . I 've told no-one else . I must tell you , and you must hear me out . I 'm sick in my heart , and old . All the ugly , lonely years have gone by . I have made the far turn . I run wounded , as I started . I run bleeding , in darkness , with all my might . I run as if I were going home , Ben , but I have no home . Home is a street at night , a dark door of a great house in which she slept . Home is where I was murdered , where the love died in me , where the hate was born . ( Fiercely ) I know he can write this story for me , Ben . MANHEIM He could never write a story like that . HAMMER ( Almost angry ) Of course he can ! Ben , we 've known each other a long time . I went one way and you went another . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you went . Maybe my way was not as right as yours , but if you love me , or even if you only pity me  --  in memory of all the years we 've known one another  --  go to him , talk to him , be gentle , be generous in your heart  --  I ca n't  --  get him to go home and write the story . Before I die , I want to see it in pictures . Then I can go home  --  yes , Ben , I am going  --  but instead of being dead there , I 'll be alive . Instead of hating , I 'll love . ( Pause MANHEIM looks at HAMMER curiously . At last he puts his hand on HAMMER 'S shoulder ) p. 60 MANHEIM I 'll go , Patrick . ( MANHEIM goes . When the door is heard to shut at the foot of the steps , HAMMER leaps to his feet , almost in a fury . He walks around , back and forth , like a wild animal . He goes to the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and starts it , listens a moment , then turns it off . He then goes to the telephone , and dials ) HAMMER ( On the telephone , in his genuine voice , strong and commanding ) Mr. Hammer speaking . Let me speak to Miss Fitch , please . ( Pause , irritated , almost shouting ) I told you this is Mr. Hammer speaking . I do n't care if she is in the shower . Just hand her the ' phone or get her out . ( Pause ) Betty ?  --  Mr. Hammer . ( He holds the telephone out at arm 's length just as HARRY had done until the screaming ends ) I know you 're unhappy about the part in Danger Street . Why should n't you be unhappy ? It 's a lousy part . But what makes you think you deserve a better part ? ( He holds the telephone at arm 's length again ) Yes , yes , I know . Now , calm down . I 'm thinking of putting another writer on the story . Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll come down for a talk . ( Pause , while he holds the telephone out just a short distance from his ear . The woman 's voice is warm and friendly now . He listens with an expression of terrible contempt , maybe for her , maybe for himself ) I 'm not so happy myself , Betty . We 'll sit down together , have a couple of drinks , and talk things over . ( Pause ) Five minutes ? Nonsense . You do n't need to dress for me . Just send the maid away . ( Pause ) That 's a good girl . I 'll be right down . ( He hangs up . His face becomes creased with grief which is unmistakably boyish . He straightens out , turns , and goes ) p. 61 CURTAIN p. 62 Act 2 , Scene 2 ACT TWOScene Two HARRY BIRD 'S office about an hour and a half later . The place is dim now and almost desolate-looking SAM comes up the steps slowly and heavily . When he reaches the level of the floor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good big swig , puts the cap back on the bottle , puts the bottle back into his overcoat pocket , and looks around the place . He turns on the pianola . He notices the message on the blackboard , Ave Maria , erases the words . He goes to the water jar , moistens his handkerchief , touches it to his black eye , comes back to the slate and wipes the whole thing with the wet handkerchief , making it very clean . He takes up a piece of chalk and on the slate prints in very large letters : I Am Sam . He then signs this message , in handwriting , Sam . He looks at his message a moment and then takes off his hat in a cheer and waves it . SAM Hooray for Sam ! Long live Sam ! Vive la Sam ! ( He takes a swig ) Vive la Everybody ! Vive la  --  YOU ! Vive la  --  ME ! ( Pause , drunkenly ) Vive  --  vive ! ( He erases the slate with the wet handkerchief again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( He turns off the pianola . A young man , about eighteen , scrambles up the steps into the office . SAM points to the blackboard ) You can see the message for yourself . What 's the matter with you ? p. 63 MESSENGER ( Breathless ) They said I 'd find Mr. Hammer here  --  in Harry Bird 's office . SAM Who are you ? MESSENGER I 'm one of the company messengers . SAM Yes , yes  --  but what 's your name ? ( He points to the blackboard ) Vive , vive ! MESSENGER My name 's Joe Rigga . I 've got to find Mr. Hammer . ( He turns to go ) SAM Wait a minute . What 's the matter , boy ? MESSENGER ( Bitterly ) My best friend too . The best guy I ever met . The only writer who ever read one of my stories . But I 'll show them . I 'll be the same kind of writer he was . A great writer . SAM ( Very quietly ) I 'm drunk , see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I get scared . ( He clutches the boy by the shoulders ) Joe  --  tell me what 's happened . Tell me real quiet . MESSENGER I do n't know for sure . They say he got killed  --  Harry Bird . They say his car went over a cliff out in the valley . They  --  p. 64 SAM Do n't be silly , boy . Who says Harry Bird 's been killed ? MESSENGER Everybody  --  it 's all over the place . SAM It 's a lie . ( He brings the bottle out and takes a swig ) Harry Bird  --  killed ! Nonsense . MESSENGER He was the only writer who ever talked to me . He was the only one who asked me my name . Just because I 'm a messenger now , they think I 'm going to be a messenger all the time . SAM ( Offering the bottle ) He 's not killed  --  you need a drink , that 's all . MESSENGER No , I do n't , but I 'll take one anyway . ( He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  him . Gone  --  ( He takes a swig )  --  but not forgotten . ( He hands the bottle back to SAM ) SAM ( Lifting the bottle ) Do n't be silly . ( He finishes what 's in the bottle , looks around ) Joe  --  it is n't going to make any difference , if it 's true , but what do they say happened ? MESSENGER They say he was driving with a girl through the hills out in the valley  --  about a hundred miles an hour . ( Pause ) They went over the side , that 's all . p. 65 SAM They 're a lot of little old women . A lot of shameless gossips . ( Pointing to blackboard ) Look at the message . Vive ! ( BEN MANHEIM comes running up the steps . He is breathless and excited ) MANHEIM Where 's Mr. Hammer ? MESSENGER I 'm looking for him , too . They said he might be here . MANHEIM ( To SAM ) He 's been killed ! He was going too fast ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Go look for him . Look for him everywhere . ( MANHEIM runs to the window and shouts ) Patrick ! Patrick ! ( Turns and sees the MESSENGER , almost pushes him ) What are you waiting for ? Go find him , boy . MESSENGER Where 'll I go ? Mr. Hammer ca n't bring him back to life , can he ? MANHEIM ( Astounded ) What 's your name ? MESSENGER My name is Joseph Rigga , and you can fire me . Go ahead , fire me ! He was my friend . He read my story , he talked to me , he told me I could be a writer . Go ahead , fire me . MANHEIM ( Gently , calming down ) You 're not going to be fired . ( He sits down wearily ) p. 66 MESSENGER ( Bitterly and a little ridiculously ) Yeah ? Then I quit . I 'm through with you  --  all of you . Three years I 've been a messenger , and not one of you would talk to me . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . Why ? Because he was a human being , not a piece of machinery . To hell with all of you  --  you can keep your lousy money . I quit . ( He turns and runs down the steps . SAM looks around and follows him ) MANHEIM ( Into telephone ) This is Ben Manheim . I 'm in Harry Bird 's office . If Mr. Hammer is located , telephone me at this number , please . ( Pause , shouting ) Yes , I know what happened . I know all about it . ( Gently ) Thank you very much for wanting to tell me . ( He hangs up . HAMMER comes up the steps very slowly . He looks at MANHEIM with terrible contempt ) HAMMER Was that you shouting at me ? MANHEIM Yes , it was , Patrick  --  HAMMER ( Furiously ) Well , you 're fired , understand ? MANHEIM Very well , Patrick . HAMMER How did you know where I was ? You must be out of your head to do a thing like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my name all over the place  --  my first name , as if I were some punk around the place . Suppose somebody heard you ?  --  I 've worked thirty-five years to build company discipline . ( Mocking MANHEIM ) Patrick !  --  Patrick ! Well , here I am . Now , what is it ? p. 67 MANHEIM There 's been an accident . We 've been trying to reach you for a half-hour . Nobody has the slightest idea where you were . HAMMER It so happens I was with Betty Fitch . I had to have a little talk with her about the way she 's been carrying on . Too much temperament for a girl who is n't worth a nickel at the box-office any more . I want her to be dropped . She 's committed to one more picture after Danger Street  --  that 's the last . ( Pause ) I was with her . My visit will save the company thousands of dollars . MANHEIM I understand , Patrick . HAMMER Are you sure you do ? MANHEIM Yes , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest delicacy . More parts are to be discussed with her  --  and greater parts . Then she is to be dropped . MANHEIM Yes , I know . HAMMER All right . Now , what is it you want to tell me ? MANHEIM I thought it was going to be difficult for me to tell you this , but now I know it is n't . HAMMER Never mind  --  never mind . Just tell me. p. 68 MANHEIM Harry Bird was killed in an automobile accident about an hour ago . HAMMER ( Furiously ) That son of a bitch ! ( Swiftly ) All right , get on the ' phone . What are we waiting for ? Get the next best writer on the ' phone and let 's fly him out here from New York  --  or wherever he is . Who 's another writer who can do the story ? MANHEIM ( Quietly ) No writer can do it . HAMMER Do n't talk like a fool , please . Writers are a dime a dozen . Rattle off some of their names . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What are their names ? MANHEIM John Donne , William Blake , Henry Thoreau  --  HAMMER Get Blake on the ' phone . He sounds like somebody who ought to be able to write . William Blake  --  that 's a good solid name . Not like that Harry Bird . He did it on purpose . He would n't listen to me . He had to be a wiseguy , a guttersnipe . Had to run off and leave me holding the bag . I offered him money , but no , he wanted to rob me . So he went out and killed himself . So get William Blake on the ' phone . MANHEIM I 'm sorry , Patrick  --  he 's dead , too . HAMMER Dead ? Who asked you to name dead writers ? Get one of the other writers on the ' phone . p. 69 MANHEIM They 're all dead  --  HAMMER I want that story written , understand ? I 'm going to get it written . MANHEIM Excuse me , Patrick  --  why do n't you forget it ? HAMMER Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask you to forget it because it 's an unholy , inhuman fantasy , born of hate . HAMMER Is it unholy for a man to hold fast to his faith ? MANHEIM To faith founded on hate , it is . Forget it , Patrick . HAMMER I can see why you have never become a success . You have no sense at all  --  no sense of the timely , no sense of the dramatic , no sense of what people want and need . You 're not a showman , you 're a book-reader . ( Dramatically ) When the world is full of death  --  when men are killing one another  --  what do people think of ? They think of Mother . We 'll have the biggest box-office hit in the history of pictures . All we need is the story . The people are ready for it  --  they 're waiting for it  --  they 're asking for it  --  they 're praying for it . Get me a writer on the ' phone and I 'll talk to him myself . I 'll pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty , but not past forty  --  not too young , and not too old . Get a man I can talk to , a man I can flatter , a man who can write but has n't been around too much . Get a man who has a little respect for money . Get a man who wo n't push me around and then go out and kill himself . Get me a crook , but a little one . p. 70 MANHEIM I could get a hundred writers , Patrick , but all of them put together could n't do it . Ave Maria ? Those are n't words , Patrick . They go deep into the whole fable of human life . HAMMER The deeper the better . Get me a man who can write the Bible . The world needs a new Bible . MANHEIM Only saints can write a Bible . You 're asking for too much . HAMMER I do n't know why I have you around . There 's no such thing as asking for too much . The world has n't come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed himself . To hell with him . To hell with the story , too . If you say it ca n't be written , O.K. , I believe you . Now , tell me what kind of a story will take advantage of the way the people of the world are feeling . We have a great responsibility to the people , Ben , and I for one do n't intend to let them down . If you 're the man I believe you are , you wo n't let them down , either . If my story is no good , all right , we 'll forget it . We 'll get another story . ( ROSE SCHORNBLOOM comes in ) ( Swiftly ) Yes , Rose ? What is it ? SCHORNBLOOM I want to apologize for my behaviour this afternoon , Mr. Hammer . I 've been upset about my son , in the Army . I 've come to finish my work . They told me I might find you here . p. 71 HAMMER Oh , yes  --  it 's all right , Rose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unhappy once in a while . I 've forgotten all about it . ( He extends his hand , ROSE almost runs to him , kneels , and goes to work on the last three fingers of his left hand . He goes right on ) Now , Ben , this is very important . We 've got to have a great story , understand ? We 're turning out a lot of good pictures  --  the best ever made  --  but what we need is a great story , not just something run-of-the-mill . ( ROSE is working away at his fingers now ) Besides making money , we need a picture for prestige . We need something powerful , but tender too , with great understanding , with plenty of warmth  --  plenty of comedy  --  ( BEN MANHEIM reaches out , as if seeking to interrupt the flow of words he can no longer tolerate ) Now , do n't interrupt , Ben . Hear me out . I 'm not a reading-man . I do n't know books . But I do know this business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a a story about the human struggle to live decently . This war is going to be over before we know it , and a new world is going to be made . We 've got to be in on that  --  otherwise we 're finished . Absolutely finished , Ben . Do you think I 'd give that loud-mouth three weeks of my time if I did n't know which way the wind 's blowing , and what we 've got to do to stay alive in the world ? We 've got to have a whole new kind of writing , a whole new kind of pictures . We 've got to make the world over . We 've got to make life itself over  --  make it better , Ben . p. 72 MANHEIM You can make the world over , Patrick . I 'm sure you can . I know I ca n't . I 've grown too fond of it , and too fond of life  --  the way it is  --  HAMMER You 're not a business man , Ben . You 're a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man he is old  --  And an old man he is greyBut a young man 's heart is full of loveGet away , old man , get away . HAMMER ( While HARRY sings ) Ben , you said the son of a bitch was killed ! You 've got to get these things straight ! ( HARRY BIRD appears at the head of the stairs . His clothes are soiled and torn . He is smoking a cigarette . HAMMER gets up and moves towards him ) My boy , they told me you were dead . BIRD Who told you such a ridiculous thing ? HAMMER Ben told me just a few minutes ago . BIRD ( To BEN ) What do you mean telling him I was dead ? MANHEIM I was told you were  --  BIRD Who told you ? MANHEIM Everybody said you 'd been killed in an automobile accident . p. 73 BIRD Well , I 'm not dead , see ? I was knocked out for a while , but I came out of it O.K. ( A young DOCTOR in a white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost died . HAMMER Doctor , how is he ? Is he going to be all right ? DOCTOR ( To HAMMER ) He was unconscious for an hour . We 're not sure how serious the concussion is . He 's got to come back to the hospital . HAMMER I thank God for this miracle . ( He gets down on his knees , leaving his hand in the bowl of water ) I go down to my knees humbly and thank God for sparing your life . BIRD Ah , get up off your knees . HAMMER ( Getting up ) Doctor , see that he gets every attention  --  every attention ! Have specialists fly out from New York . DOCTOR We 've got all the specialists we need at the hospital  --  HAMMER ( Realistically ) What hospital is it ? DOCTOR The Good Samaritan . HAMMER Ben , is that the best hospital ? p. 74 MANHEIM They 're all good . HAMMER ( Furious ) Good is n't enough  --  I want the best . DOCTOR ( To HARRY ) I ca n't allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and powerful , to the DOCTOR ) Just a moment , young man . ( Tenderly ) Harry  --  DOCTOR ( Almost angry ) He 's been seriously injured  --  he 's got to come back to the hospital . HAMMER ( To the DOCTOR ) I 've been patient with you , young man , but I 'm not going to be patient any longer . DOCTOR I 'm responsible for your son . HAMMER My son ? ( Pause ) Do n't think I have n't been watching you out of the corner of my eye , young man . Well , let me tell you something . I am the man who established the Doctor Cavanaugh pictures . I do n't mind your wanting to make an impression on me , in the hope of leaving the Good Samaritan and joining my organization , but I will not allow you to interrupt me when  --  DOCTOR I do n't know what you 're talking about . Who the hell 's Doctor Cavanaugh ? p. 75 MANHEIM This man does n't want to be an actor . HAMMER Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he came here . DOCTOR ( Confused and angry ) I am a student specialist in the research of malignant tissue growths . HAMMER ( Shouting ) You 're an actor . How much are you paid for your work ? DOCTOR I work under a research grant of the Good Samaritan Hospital . HAMMER I 'll pay you five hundred dollars a week to start . DOCTOR ( To HARRY ) I must ask you to come back to the hospital . HAMMER ( Very angry ) Just a minute , young man . I 'm offering you a chance to make a name for yourself . Five hundred a week to start , a hundred extra every six months until it 's a thousand a week , and a seven-year contract after that . Ben , have Murphy draw up the papers . MANHEIM This man is not interested in moving pictures . HAMMER What do you mean ? ( To the DOCTOR ) Is that true ? DOCTOR I have n't the slightest idea what this is all about . p. 76 HAMMER I 'll give you an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand dollars ? HAMMER Ben , the next picture in our Doctor Cavanaugh series is to be about a young specialist in the research of  --  what was that , young man ? DOCTOR Malignant tissue growths . HAMMER  --  Yes  --  whose salary is barely enough to make both ends meet . He 's in love , but he ca n't get married because he ca n't afford it . He 's offered a better job  --  of some sort  --  by somebody or other  --  put a good hack writer on the story  --  but he turns it down , so he can go on with his work . He loses his girl  --  she marries a very successful man  --  not a doctor  --  who is stricken a year later with some sort of tumor of the brain , and our boy is called in to investigate . Put two writers on it , and instruct them to keep our boy from getting the girl  --  but at the same time give the story a happy ending  --  the guy 's happy in his work ! ( To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my secretary , Miss Henderson , I sent you there . DOCTOR Where is the office ? MANHEIM ( Taking the DOCTOR by the shoulders ) Do n't do it  --  Go back to the Good Samaritan Hospital . p. 77 DOCTOR I could continue my research in the evenings . HAMMER You 're an intelligent young man . Ask anybody how to get to Mr. Hammer 's office . They 'll tell you . Hurry , now . ( The DOCTOR goes ) MANHEIM ( Going with him ) Listen to me , young man . ( They stand to one side , talking softly ) HAMMER ( To HARRY ) My boy , a few minutes ago when I heard the terrible news , I died . My own son was dead , gone from the world  --  for ever . In my heart , I died , Harry . The great story he was to write was unwritten  --  and would never be written . MANHEIM ( Turning ) He does n't want to be an actor . HAMMER ( Almost shouting ) Ben , I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got important work to do . DOCTOR ( To HARRY ) We 'd better go back now . BIRD ( Gently ) I do n't like hospitals . You go back alone . I 'm all right . DOCTOR ( To MANHEIM , shaking his hand ) Good-bye , sir  --  and thanks very much . ( He turns to go ) p. 78 HAMMER ( To the DOCTOR ) Just a minute , young man . I suppose you think you 're being very noble , going back to your work  --  well , you 're not being noble , you 're being a fool  --  but all right , I wo n't stop you . Go back to your little game of hide and seek . Spend your life looking for the cause of malignant tissue growths  --  but mark my words , you 're headed for an empty life , because after you 've discovered the cause , there is n't going to be anything you can do about it . Go back to your microscopes , and knives and forks and teaspoons . I know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you think you 're going to keep people alive for ever by finding out what causes death ? You 're going to shuttle back and forth between the known and the unknown and come up with ten cents ' worth of information  --  THEY DIE ! Well , I know they die . They begin to die the minute they 're born , but while they 're waiting , I give them escape . I give them beautiful dreams . I give them a church in which to worship grace and beauty . I give them anaesthetics for their awful wounds . I give them laughter . Now get out ! Do n't take up any more of my time  --  you druggist ! ( The DOCTOR goes in confusion . HAMMER turns to BEN ) I want you to get all the information you can about that fellow . The Doctor Cavanaugh pictures are out of style . We 'll kill the whole series , and start a new one , with this boy , and a tougher villain than headaches , broken legs , and appendicitis attacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , sit down , Ben  --  I want to talk to you . p. 79 MANHEIM I 'm sorry , Patrick . I must go now . I want to take a vacation . HAMMER ( Shouting ) Sit down ! We 're on the threshold of a new day , and you want to go off like a hurt boy and pity yourself . How old do you think you are ? You 're three years younger than I am . Well , act your age . Where do you think the world would be if men ran away from their responsibilities just to be comfortable and happy ? ( Almost gently ) Sit down , Ben . ( BEN sits down . HAMMER turns to HARRY , who is going through his desk , piling sheets of paper together  --  manuscripts , notes , and so on ) How do you feel , my boy ? Are you all right ? BIRD I feel fine . HAMMER Are you sure you should n't go back to the hospital for a check-up ? BIRD No , I feel fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old . Even you look wonderful to me now , Old Man . HAMMER ( Pause ) Harry , what are those papers ? BIRD Nothing  --  idle notes  --  a couple of short stories  --  some scenes for a play . I thought I 'd take ' em along  --  for reference . p. 80 HAMMER I 'd like to look at those notes , Harry . BIRD They 're nothing  --  they would n't make sense to anybody but me . HAMMER You may have something there I could use . I 've got a staff of fifty regular writers  --  a gang of thieves who sit around all day playing gin rummy , gossiping like a lot of old women , crying their eyes out because they are n't writing great books . Let me put the whole mob of them to work . I 'll hand every one of them a page of notes , and tell them to make a story out of whatever 's on the page . I 'll tell them to go to work or get out . How much do you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do . The only thing written on this page is a name . HAMMER What is the name ? BIRD ( Holding the sheet ) Margaret Corrigan . HAMMER ( Getting to his feet ) Where 'd you get that name ? MANHEIM I happened to mention it to him this afternoon . HAMMER Ben , for God 's sake , why ca n't you follow instructions ? I told you I did n't want that name bandied around . All day you 've failed me  --  one thing after another . I 've loved you like a brother  --  but how long do you expect me to endure these awful blunders ? p. 81 BIRD Ah , take it easy , Old Man . I wo n't mention the name to anybody as long as I live . ( He tears up the sheet of paper ) I 've made a lot of trouble for you these three weeks . It 's about time I got the hell out of here and let you alone . Ben is the best friend you 've got . ( He offers his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HAMMER ( Takes his hand ) My boy , where are you going ? BIRD I 'm going home . So long , Ben . I did n't mean to make any trouble . ( He turns to go ) HAMMER Harry , my boy ! Do n't go just yet . Wait a little longer . You 've been here three weeks  --  stay a little longer . BIRD Somebody 's waiting for me . HAMMER Harry , I 've told Ben the story and I want to tell it to you , too . BIRD What story ? HAMMER Ave Maria  --  our story , the story you 're going to write for me . BIRD Listen , Old Man  --  I know Ave Maria is a great story  --  I 'm not kidding  --  I speak humbly  --  it 's great  --  but I ca n't write it . It 's your story . I have enough trouble writing my own . Look at this bundle of notes . On every page I 've tried to tell the truth  --  not about you , or Ben , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't been able to do it . I get near the truth , but that 's all . If I ca n't write the truth about myself , how can I write it about you ? p. 82 HAMMER You can , Harry  --  if any writer in the world can , you can . You 've changed since your accident . You 're not so bitter and angry . Now , you can really write the story  --  Harry , please  --  I ask you  --  do n't go off this way with nothing settled . Say you 'll write the story . BIRD You 're too great a man for me to figure out . HAMMER I 'm not a great man , Harry . If you 'll let me tell you the story you 'll see that I 'm not great  --  you 'll see that no man is great . We do n't count  --  you and I and the other fellow  --  we come and go , making noise , but we 're nothing  --  nothing at all , Harry . Things count . Things are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . ( He turns to BEN ) We 're all weak and foolish and full of terrible wounds . All of us together  --  the millions of us  --  are almost great  --  but not quite . We 're ugly ! We 're made ugly by the trouble we 're always having , and there 's no beauty in us until we 're hurt  --  until we 've been made humble by failure  --  and then turn  --  each man in his own way  --  to the bright image of his childhood  --  the image of light and glory that fills his sleep as long as he lives . Sit down , Harry , and let me tell you the story . BIRD I 've got to go . I 'd write the story for you if I could , but I ca n't . I know I ca n't . ( Pause ) I 'm sorry , Old Man . I 'm really sorry . p. 83 HAMMER ( Pause , softly ) All right , Harry . Good-bye , then , and God bless you . ( Pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her my blessings , too . BIRD Thanks . She 's at the bus station . We 're going home to San Francisco to be married . MANHEIM Harry , you 're not going to marry that girl ? HAMMER ( Angry ) Ben , will you shut up a minute ? ( Gently ) My boy , I 'm glad for you . I thank God for the girl . I know she 'll make you very happy . MANHEIM ( To HAMMER ) But you do n't understand . HAMMER ( Angrier ) Ben , will you please shut up ? ( To HARRY ) My boy , can I help you ? BIRD No  --  thanks a lot , Old Man . HAMMER A little present , Harry . I 'll get Murphy to write out a cheque for twenty-five thousand dollars . You can pay me back when you feel like it . No strings attached  --  I swear to God I 'm telling the truth . BIRD So long , Old Man ( He begins to go ) p. 84 MANHEIM Harry  --  as one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heart not to marry that girl . ( The door opens ) You 've had an accident . Something 's happened to you . You do n't know what you 're doing . ( MARTHA comes in ) BIRD I know what I 'm doing , Beh . ( He turns to MARTHA , smiling ) O.K. , Martha . I 've got everything . MANHEIM I must talk to you , young woman . BIRD It 's all right , Ben . HARPER ( To HARRY ) Your friend Sam 's downstairs  --  drunk . He 's lying in the street . I tried to help him up , but I could n't . ( HARRY , forgetting himself , turns quickly and goes down the stairs , leaving MARTHA standing in front of MANHEIM . She moves imperceptibly to follow HARRY , but ca n't . MANHEIM stares at MARTHA . She looks as if she might burst into tears . There is a moment of awkwardness . Suddenly she turns and runs to the stairs , to go ) MANHEIM ( Powerfully ) Just a minute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you . ( MARTHA turns  --  frightened and troubled . HAMMER watches , looking from MARTHA to MANHEIM ) Please come here . ( As if hypnotized MARTHA moves to MANHEIM . He looks her straight in the eye ) This afternoon I thought I knew the truth about you . I thought you were acting , but now I 'm not so sure . I do n't believe you yourself meant to become the person you have become to Harry Bird . To a simpler person you would be what you are , and you know what that is  --  the good Lord knows I do n't . Harry Bird is a writer . He has created the person he wants you to be . You may be an actress , but I do n't think you could go on acting that part for the rest of your life . Now , I may be wrong , and I hope I am . Only you know  --  nobody else . If I 'm right , I ask you to go away  --  leave him alone . Let things quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that you get a contract . ( Deeply hurt and stunned , almost in tears , MARTHA turns and runs down the stairs ) p. 85 HAMMER What the hell do you think you 're doing , Ben ? MANHEIM You do n't understand . I had to tell her . It hurt me to do it  --  and I hope I 'm wrong  --  but I had to do it . HAMMER Why ? MANHEIM I 'm afraid she 's a cheap little ambitious whore . HAMMER Who said so ? MANHEIM She did  --  she said so herself . He asked her , and she told him . I thought she was acting , but I 'm afraid she was n't . And then for some reason , he liked her and made her over , the way he wanted her to be  --  the way she seems to be . HAMMER ( Quietly ) You 've never learned much from the books you 've read , have you ? Let 's say you 're right . Do you think I give a good God damn what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 'll write the story . I know he will . When are you going to start understanding things ? Now she 'll go off and cry and never see him again  --  and then where am I ? Right back where I started , with the story as far from being written as ever . I know he meant to go home and write the story  --  I know it . And now , just because you had to shoot off your big loud mouth , she 's run off , broken-hearted . Well , I tell you that son of a bitch wo n't write another word until he 's found her  --  and if he does n't find her , he 'll think he 's lost the only woman in the world for him . When are you going to stop being a fool ? Now go out and find her and bring her back  --  do you hear ? You drove her away , so go bring her back . p. 86 MANHEIM ( Standing , pleading , deeply troubled ) I 'm tired , Patrick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'll find each other . I ca n't do another thing . I want to go home . HAMMER ( Shouting ) Go out and find her  --  bring her back ! ( MANHEIM goes . HAMMER turns to ROSE . He speaks gently ) Rose . You saw that girl . Is she a whore ? SCHORNBLOOM Can a woman who loves a man that way be a whore ? HAMMER Has she been a whore ? SCHORNBLOOM Is there any woman who has n't ? HAMMER ( Amazed ) You have never spoken this way before . SCHORNBLOOM There has n't been anyone to speak to . HAMMER I 've known you eleven years . SCHORNBLOOM But you have never before been who you are to-day  --  and I have not been who I am . We are made by one another . We are not made in the woman 's belly , but in the world 's . We are one or another of the nine months which shall some day be the birth of the real human race . If my poor son in the Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be born ? p. 87 HAMMER I 'm amazed . ( Looking at hands ) Are you finished ? SCHORNBLOOM I have been finished for some time . HAMMER Then why did n't you go ? SCHORNBLOOM I have listened many times to you and Mr. Manheim and your writers talking about stories , and I have always felt that something was wrong with them . Please  --  Mr. Hammer  --  this once , let me stay . I wo n't be noticed . I 'll pretend to be working . HAMMER I 'm amazed ! ( The downstairs door opens . HAMMER extends his hand to ROSE , who takes it ) SCHORNBLOOM Thank you , Mr. Hammer . ( HARRY BIRD comes in supporting SAM , who is still pretty drunk ) SAM The dirty little gossips told me you were dead ! I did n't believe them , but I got drunk just in case it was true . BIRD Here  --  lie down on this couch . ( SAM lies down ) SAM Vive ! vive ! vive ! ( He goes to sleep ) BIRD ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HAMMER She 'll be back in a minute , Harry . I told her I had to talk over a few things with you , so she went out for a walk . BIRD What the hell did you tell her that for ? HAMMER Harry  --  while you were gone  --  I had a chance to get a little acquainted with her . She 's the girl for you . She 's as beautiful as a girl I once knew in Dublin . She loves you . I thank God that you 've found her  --  that you 're going to marry her  --  because I know what it is to go through life with everything the next best , instead of the best . ( The telephone rings . HAMMER answers it ) Yes ? ( Pause ) Yes , Ben ? ( He listens ) Bring her back , that 's all  --  ( Shouting ) Just bring her back ! ( He listens ) All right , then  --  keep her there . I 'll send him to her . ( He hangs up ) Harry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus station . She 's bought a ticket to Great Falls . The bus is leaving in ten minutes . BIRD ( Stunned ) Great Falls ? Who the hell are you talking about ? HAMMER Your girl  --  the girl you 're going to marry . She wants to go home to Great Falls . Do n't let her do it . Take her to San Francisco . She 's yours , my boy  --  do n't let her get away . Do n't lose her . I know what it is to lose the only person in the world who can keep love alive . p. 89 BIRD ( Shouting ) Home in Great Falls ? You 're crazy ! She 's never been in Great Falls in her life . She invented that story . ( The telephone rings . HAMMER answers it ) HAMMER Yes ? ( He listens ) Yes , he 's here . BIRD ( Excited ) Who is it ? HAMMER ( Into telephone ) I ca n't hear you . Please speak a little louder . ( HAMMER listens ) BIRD What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you 'd better talk to him . ( To HARRY ) She wants me to tell you something , but I ca n't make out what it is . She 's crying . BIRD Who 's crying , for God 's sake ? HAMMER Your girl , Harry . Talk to her . She 's a little upset , that 's all . It 's nothing . Be gentle and kind  --  be patient . BIRD ( Confused , scared and not sure he ought to go to the telephone ) What the hell 's she crying for ? What 's she want to talk to me by telephone for ? p. 90 HAMMER Talk to her , my boy  --  it 's nothing . She 's the best  --  she 's yours  --  do n't lose her . BIRD ( Goes to the telephone , looks at it , takes it up slowly . He speaks softly , almost whispering ) Martha ? ( He listens . The expression of pain on his face changes to an expression of relief and delight and tender regard . He is almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Ah , now , Martha  --  you do n't have to cry about that . I did n't mean to leave you that way . ( Softly , gently ) Now , stop your crying , do you hear ? Stop your crying . I 'm sorry . I just did n't want to see Sam drunk , that 's all . ( He listens ) He 's all right now . He 's gone to sleep . ( Pause , he listens , then speaks softly ) Martha ? What 's this about Great Falls ? ( He listens , speaks with relief ) For the love of Mike , Martha , stop acting for Ben Manheim  --  you 're wrecking his faith . ( He laughs ) Tell him to go home , and you wait there for me . We 'll catch the next bus  --  there 's no hurry . I 'll be there in a few minutes . ( Listens ) Of course I 'm not angry  --  I was just a little scared , that 's all . ( Listens ) O.K. ( He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief . He looks at HAMMER , and nods . He looks at ROSE SCHORNBLOOM , and nods , smiling ) She 's mine . ( Whispering ) She 's always been mine . She saved my ridiculous life . After the accident I dreamed I was going to die , and I did n't care . Why not die ? It was all nonsense  --  loneliness and noise and running about , anyway . Why not be done with it ? For God 's sake  --  how clean do you want your hands to be ? Then in my dream came a beautiful blinding light  --  I opened my eyes and there before me , behold , was the face of love and truth and beauty  --  her face  --  and I cared a lot . I kept caring for what seemed centuries , living my poor life again and again , struggling with everything for another chance  --  struggling to be born again , and then at last it happened , I got my chance , and I opened my eyes . There before me again , looking into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with tears . I got up to take her home with me . ( He kisses ROSE SCHORNBLOOM on the forehead ) Good-bye , Rose Schornbloom. p. 91 HAMMER ( On his knees ) I thank God , my boy , for sparing your life . BIRD So long , Old Man . ( He turns and runs out of the place , with HAMMER shouting after him ) HAMMER Write the story , my boy ! Now , you can write it ! Write our story , Harry ! ( The downstairs door slams , HAMMER runs to the window ) Harry  --  my boy  --  I 'll send Murphy up to San Francisco with a contract and a cheque  --  you 'll need money for a new house  --  for clothes for your wife and your children . HARRY 'S VOICE ( Shouting ) Go home , Old Man  --  go home . HAMMER ( Shouting ) My boy  --  tell me you 'll write the story . HARRY 'S VOICE I 'll try , Old Man . I give you my word  --  I 'll try ! HAMMER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ask , Harry . Go home with your girl , and God bless you . ( He returns to ROSE who 's been packing up her things , and is now ready to go . He sits down and cries audibly ) SCHORNBLOOM What 's the matter , Mr. Hammer ? p. 92 HAMMER I 'm old , Rose . And the world 's so young . ( He dials a number on the telephone , and with tears streaming down his face he speaks forcefully ) Murphy ? Mr. Hammer . ( He turns to ROSE , putting his hand over the telephone ) You can go now , Rose . Thank you very much . ( ROSE goes . HAMMER returns to the telephone ) Now , listen , Murphy  --  listen carefully . The son of a bitch is going to write the story . It took me three weeks to do it , but I finally did it . Now , listen . He 's on his way to the bus station to pick up one of our extras  --  a girl named Martha Harper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met you , so I want you to get on that bus . I want you to strike up an acquaintance with him  --  tell him you 're a lawyer or something  --  but you 've read his books  --  every one of them . You have , have n't you ? All but the first two ? O.K. , talk about the books you 've read . He 'll talk to you . Now listen , Murphy . I want you to find out how little he 'll take for the story after he 's written it . I think we can get it for almost nothing . I want you to find out what he thinks of me , too . Tell him you met me once in connection with some legal work and that you think I 'm  --  well , tell him you think I 'm a crook , Put it in those words , do you understand ? And then listen very carefully to what he tells you . When you get to San Francisco telephone me . Have you got it ? ( Pause ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while he dials another number ) The son of a bitch  --  trying to pull a fast one on me ! ( Into telephone ) This is Patrick Hammer . Let me speak to Miss Corrigan , please . ( He waits ) Margaret , I 've got good news for you . I 've found the story with which to introduce you to the American public at last . ( The downstairs door opens ) Is it a good story ? It 's going to be the biggest picture I 've ever made . Now , I 've cancelled all engagements for the evening . I 'll come by in a half-hour and pick you up . We 'll drive out to my place and spend the night there , and I 'll tell you all about it . ( BETTY FITCH has stood at the head of the stairs , listening to the last few sentences ) Yes  --  in a half-hour . ( He hangs up ) p. 93 FITCH Listen , you old wreck , what are you trying to do , give me the bum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool out of me , you horrible old man . HAMMER ( Powerfully ) Behave yourself , young woman . You must be dreaming . ( He is about to go ) FITCH ( Screaming ) I suppose I was dreaming this afternoon when you were in my dressing-room ? HAMMER ( Going ) Oh , do n't be ugly . ( He goes ) FITCH Who made me ugly ? You did  --  you , with your soft fat body . ( She sits down on the couch where SAM 'S sleeping . SAM sits up ) SAM Ah , come on  --  do n't cry . You 're all right . ( He gets up and turns on the pianola ) Come on , do n't cry . You 're beautiful ! You 're wonderful ! Come on  --  dance with me ! ( She gets up , sobbing , and they begin to dance ) FITCH ( Blubbering ) I 'm alone  --  I 've got no friend in the world . SAM No ? You 've got me , honey . ( The curtain begins to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
