For the second time in the South Pacific the Japs got a bellyful of surprise . Chased out of bases in the Solomons , last week they decided to attack Milne Bay , which lies at the southern tip of New Guinea . They headed south in warships and transports . Allied fighter planes lugging small bombs spotted them , strafed their transports and sank a gunboat . But under a screen of low-lying clouds and a tropical downpour , they ducked into the ten-mile-wide mouth of Milne Bay , launched barges and poured out on the swamp-fringed shore . <P> Then came the surprise . The extent of military installations and the strength of the Australian holding force in Milne Bay had been a closely guarded military secret . It was a secret no longer . From their ambush , Australian combat forces under veteran Major General Cyril Clowes fell on the invaders , drove them from the narrow shore into the waist-deep mud of the mangrove swamps . Allied planes blasted them . The Japanese sent a rescue fleet of eight destroyers and a cruiser to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their tanks and heavy equipment . <P> Not only was it a bellyful of surprise ; it was a shoeful of irritation to the hop-skipping Jap , to whom the total conquest of New Guinea is becoming increasingly difficult . Ever since he landed at Buna on the north shore July 22 , he has been trying to get at Port Moresby . His land forces have worn themselves out on New Guinea 's sharp-humped backbone . Now a sweep around the seacoast had been wrecked .
