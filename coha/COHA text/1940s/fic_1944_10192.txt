DESIGN IN DIAMONDSThere was another card marked " Diego Mena " in a neat brass slot on the door of the second-floor apartment and a bell button discreetly sunk in the doorframe . Corey put his fore- finger on it and held it there . And after a moment he looked at me with a scowl . " That 's funny . You 'd think one of these times he 'd keep an appointment , would n't you ? " " We 're a few minutes early , " I pointed out . Then on one of those inexplicable impulses I reached for the handle of the door and turned it . It opened . " Hold on ! " Corey muttered . " I do n't like this . Wait here a minute . " He went in , and through the half-open door I could see him inspecting the place . There were several doors opening out of the big living room , and he opened them one after the other and glanced swiftly around the inner rooms . After a moment he came back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . The guy prob- ably had to go out for something and left the door unlocked for us . " I followed him into the room . I did n't intend to tell Corey that the tips of my fingers were actually quivering , or that premonition lay on my heart like a leaden weight . He would have said my imagination was having a field day . But I knew , with intuitive certainty , that it was n't imagination . " Diego does himself very well , " Corey said appreciatively , glancing about the comfortable room . " And Anselmo had better be a bit more careful with his pipe or he wo n't be offered the place again . " As he spoke he righted an overturned smoking stand and picked up a pipe which lay on the floor . Then , with it cradled in his hand , he looked at me , and I noticed that the ash had burned a hole in the deep-piled rug . And then I saw something else  --  a dark spattering of dropsDESIGN IN DIAMONDS 21on the cream-colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corey 's . " That looks like blood ! " I whispered . He muttered something under his breath and went down on one knee . He touched one of those sticky-looking drops gingerly and rubbed it between his thumb and forefinger . Then he got up silently and opened a door leading into the bathroom , and I heard the sound of running water . I could n't seem to move ; I simply stood there in the middle of the floor , rigid , with my heartbeats echoing hollowly in my ears . After a moment Corey came back . His cheerful face had a grim look , and his nostrils were pinched . " We 'd better get out of here , Margot , " he said . " There may be a perfectly good explanation of all this , but I 'm not taking any chances . " " He might still be here , in one of the other rooms . He might need help . " My lips felt stiff as I said the words . " If he is , he 's well hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then he was gone , and I sank down limply in a big chair . There was a low table beside it covered with books and magazines . " There 's no one in the apartment , " Corey announced , coming back into the room . And suddenly my eyes came to a focus on faintly scrawled pencil marks on the cover of a magazine . " Corey ! Look at this ! " I breathed . It was the familiar device of the spire and circle again and my own name in big widely spaced letters , cunningly half hiddenin the cover design , and beneath , a scribble of faint , minute characters . I snatched it up and carried it to the window . " What in the world ? " Corey took it out of my hand andspelled out the cryptic letters . " KtBZ2814CuerMex ' " ' Mex , ' " he repeated . " Did n't you say the guy came from Mexico ? " 22 DESIGN IN DIAMONDS " Yes . Kt B is , of course , Katrien ter Broek , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She 's with Senor Colin 's mother in Cuernavaca  --  forty miles or so from Mexico City . " " Come on ! " With one swift motion Corey ripped the cover off the magazine and stuffed it in his pocket . Then he was urgingme toward the door . He had a handkerchief in his hand and he gave the knob a swift polish as he closed the door . " You did n't touch anything else , did you ? " he demanded under his breath . I shook my head numbly . " Only the chair  --  the fabric would n't show fingerprints . " Corey made a sudden warning sound , and I heard the scuffle of feet on the uncarpeted stairs . He swept me back into the apartment , across the living room and through the swinging door into the kitchen . It was only just in time , for we heard the apartment door open and the guarded voices of men in the living room . " We 've got to hustle . Ten o'clock , the appointment is , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure there 's no sign of anything suspicious . " Corey 's fingers closed over mine , and his head made a curt gesture toward the door which evidently led from the kitchen to a back staircase . I knew his idea was good , but my curiosity was stronger than my discretion . I shook my head stubbornly . Then one of the men said something sharply , and there was anger , and a hint of consternation , in his voice . With the utmost caution Corey opened the swinging door a crack , and we peeped into the adjoining room . They were standing before the hearth , and it was evident that they had noticed that the smoking stand had been righted and the pipe removed . Corey struck his head dramatically with his closed fist , drew the pipe out of his pocket , and made a mutely comical face . The men seemed to be talking with suppressed violence , or , DESIGN IN DIAMONDS 28rather , the taller man was talking and the other one was listening . We could not see their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We could only make out that the man named Karl was of medium height and stocky build ; the other , evidently the one in authority , was somewhat taller and of sparer , more athletic frame . Suddenly the tall man noticed the drops of blood and ripped out an oath under his breath . Then he growled a command , and the man named Karl fairly leaped for the bathroom door . For an instant I saw his face . It had a porcine look , with bulgingblue eyes and a cleft in his fat chin . In a moment he was back with a great wad of toilet paper in his hand . He dropped onto his knees , scrubbed the tiles with wet paper , and polished them with dry . Then he gathered up the debris and took it back into the bathroom , and we heard the flushing of the toilet . As he returned he polished the doorknob with his handkerchief , and I saw Corey smile sourly at the repetition of his own cautiousperformance a few minutes earlier . The tall man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was something like the noise small boys make imitating a machine gun . Then he stalked out of the apartment with Karl at his heels , and the outer door slammed shut behind them . Corey 's breath went out gustily . " Well , that , my pet , is that . " I sat down limply on a wooden chair beside the kitchen table . " Do you think they 've actually gone ? " " Definitely . I think the mastermind 's got the wind up . " He chuckled . " For a minute I thought I 'd pulled a boner with that pipe , but I 'm beginning to think it was pretty smart . " " What does it mean ? " He sat down on the edge of the table and he , too , looked puzzled . " I have n't the remotest idea . You 're sure  --  dead certain  --  that the big boy is n't the same guy who telephoned you ? " 24 DESIGN IN DIAMONDS " Absolutely . I got a very clear impression of a personality over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger than this man . And he 's more  --  oh , it 's hard to put into words  --  more sensitive , instinctively well bred " Okay , " he cut in . " We need n't go into psychoanalysis . If you had any doubts about it I 'd have known you were screwy . It looks as if they 'd disposed of Anselmo ; maybe they 're going to send somebody to take his place . " " Surely they do n't think I 'd be such a fool as to hand over three million dollars ' worth of jewels to the wrong man ! " Corey 's brows went up . " It 's hard to say just what they expect . But that guy Karl looked to me as if he might have a persuasive way with him if the mastermind could n't get results by mere personality . " " They would n't dare  --  in broad daylight , right in the middle of New York City ! " Corey took a package of cigarettes out of his pocket and offered it to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along my spine , like a trickle of ice water . " But how could they have known about the appointment ? " I insisted . Corey shrugged again and held a match for me . " They did know  --  that 's all that 's important . Got a look at that note he sent you , I imagine . The taxi driver may have been one of their buddies  --  or it could have been a simple matter of intimida-tion . " We had been avoiding the question that was in both our minds , holding it away deliberately . " Corey , what about Anselmo ? " I asked soberly . " What do you think has happened to him ? " " Oh , he went out for a drink , " he said too jauntily . " And the blood  --  I suppose you 've an explanation for that ? " " Sure . He cut himself shaving . " He ground out his cigarettewith sudden violence . " We 're not kidding each other , Margot . DESIGN IN DIAMONDS 25Something happened just before we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was removed against his will . It looks to me like a mere scuffle and a nosebleed ; there was n't enough blood for  --  well , anything more serious . But obviously it 's a case for the police . Let 's get back to the office and handle it from there . Then maybe we wo n't have to explain what we 're doing here ourselves . " He chuckled and added , " Sez I , always the optimist . " But as the taxi sped down Park Avenue my own sober second judgment began to awaken . I was thinking of the secret Adrien ter Broek had entrusted to us and of all that had happened since to make our stewardship a sacred thing  --  sacred even beyondlife and death . Three million dollars in the hands of our country 's enemies  --  right here in the United States  --  what a weapon of violence it would be ! I was remembering , too , that picture of Katrien her father had given us , the brave lift of her chin , the straightness of her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voice of the man who called himself Anselmo Colin when he talked to me on the telephone  --  something steadfast , determined . Those three had put a trust into my keeping ; they had faith in my ability to handle it wisely . Once I let the secret out of my hands , even into the capable ones of the New York City police , we would all have lost our freedom of action . Even Anselmo , in whatever danger he might be , would , I thought , be the first to warn me against too hasty action . " We 're not going to report this to the police  --  not yet , anyway , " I said . Corey stared at me . " You 're crazy ! The police know how to handle these things . In fifteen minutes they 'll throw a net around this town that a cockroach could n't wriggle through . This gang could n't very well murder a man in broad daylight in this neighborhood , but once let ' em get Anselmo to a hideaway-overin Jersey , say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IN DIAMONDSchances are n't worth a plugged nickel . And we may as well be realistic about this . " His voice grated . " Remember , he knows things they 'd go a long way for . Just think it over . " He did n't need to make the point . I had been thinking about it  --  wondering whether under any circumstances it was justifiableto gamble a man 's life against a hunch . But this thing beating insistently in my brain was something more than a hunch  --  it was a conviction , indefensible but unshakable , that I was right . I shook my head . " Anselmo will have to take his chances . We 're going to wait . I think we 'll hear from him . If we do n't  --  well , this thing is bigger than he is . Three million dollars is something of a war asset , even by Hitler 's reckoning . I 'm responsiblefor it and I 'm going to deliver it into the hands of its rightful owner and not go straying down any bypaths . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trail of the mastermind and let them do the work for you ? " " My dear man , how do you know he 's the mastermind ? From all I 've heard , there 's only one of those  --  in the Wilhelmstrasse . Do you think for one minute that if the police remove these two our difficulties will be over ? We 'd have to start from scratch with the next pair . " " That 's all very well . But I would n't know that tall guy from a hole in the wall , and I do n't think you would either . " " Maybe not , " I said a trifle impatiently , " but I got a good look at Karl . And now that we are forewarned about them , we ought to be able to recognize their next move . These things always follow a logical course , if you 've got something to start with . " " I hope  --  I hope , " he grunted as the taxi stopped before our office building . I was n't feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convictions are all very well , but there is somethingappalling in the knowledge that you have taken uponDESIGN IN DIAMONDS 27yourself a moral responsibility for a man 's life . I do n't like to look back upon the next two hours . I shut myself in my private office and paced the floor , smoking one cigarette after another furiously  --  a thing I almost never did . During those hours I came to realize what a tower of strength Felix had always been to me and how much I actually depended on him . I would have given everything I had in the world right then to have heard him tell me I was right . After a couple of lifetimes had gone by there was a tap on the door and Corey strolled in , with a studied nonchalance that was utterly transparent . " How about a spot of lunch , old-timer ? " he asked . I shook my head . " I could n't , Corey . Besides , I 've got to stay right here just in case  --  " " Do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopefully . " About the police ? Better late than never . " " I 'd give my right arm to change it , but I ca n't . It 's one of those minds . But , Corey "  --  I looked at him and I imagine there was sheer desperation in my eyes  --  " I wish Felix were here ! " " So do I ! " he growled unhappily . Just then the buzzer sounded on my desk , and I sprang to answer it . My secretary 's voice had an excited sound . She , too , I knew , had been keeping vigil in the outer office . " Someone is calling from Mercy Hospital in Mount Vernon . A woman . She does n't seem exactly sure who she wants , but she used the name Blair . Shall I put her on ? " " Of course ! " Then a woman 's voice was speaking hesitantly . " Hello ! I 'm not sure  --  is your name Blair ? " " Yes  --  yes , I 'm Miss Blair ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Mercy Hospital . A man was brought in a little while ago  --  an accident case . He was struck by an automobile on the Bronx River Park-way " My head was spinning . " Is his name Colin  --  Anselmo Colin ? " 28 DESIGN IN DIAMONDS " He has no identifying papers and he ca n't seem to tell us who he is . But he keeps muttering the name Norman Blair and telling us to look it up in the New York phone book . We have tried every Blair . Then I thought , as a last resort , I would try the Norman and found the name of your firm . He is a young man in the late twenties  --  very dark  --  olive complexion " I cut her short . " Yes , I know him ! His name , I feel sure , is Anselmo Colin , and you may use this address , 14 West FortyninthStreet . Is he badly hurt ? " " I think not , " she said judiciously . " Possible concussion  --  he 's quite badly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken wrist . We will have to keep him under observation for a few days , just to be safe about the head injury . " Relief was flowing through me like a revitalizing transfusion . " I 'm so glad ! I will come out just as fast as a taxi can get me there . He is in a private room ? " " No , we did not know " " Have him put in one , please . And see that no expense is spared for anything he needs . And there is one other thing . I shall be there in an hour or so . In the meantime , I want a nurse in his room every minute . He is not to be left alone  --  under-stand ? " " I think you may rely on us to know what is necessary for the patient , " she said a trifle tartly . " Forgive me , " I said , " but this is really important , and it 's no reflection on your professional competence . " " Very well , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat and coat , Corey ! " I caroled , and dashed to get my own . " And I hereby serve notice that I 've had the hunch to end all hunches ! I would n't go through with another one , not for ten million dollars ! " " Do n't say that , second sight , " said Corey . " Someday when the war 's over you and I are going out to Belmont and play the races . " DESIGN IN DIAMONDS 29CHAPTER VEVEN hospital superintendents are reasonable human beings , and after hearing as much of our story as we had thought it wise to tell her  --  which , as a matter of fact , held the merest germ of the truth  --  Miss Garrett agreed to permit us to talk to Anselmo Colin as soon as he recovered consciousness . The floor supervisor opened the door silently and we tiptoed into the room . In the high narrow bed a man lay very still , his eyes closed , and against the white bandages that swathed his head his olive skin had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurse rose from her seat at the bedside and nodded quietly . " He 's rather restless , " she whispered . " Not quite conscious , I think , though he seemed to understand when I told him you were coming . " The floor supervisor drew her aside for a quiet word of explanation , and I sat down close to the bed , with Corey at my side . Then the floor supervisor departed , and the nurse took a chair just inside the door and began to read a magazine , ostentatiously uninterested . I put my hand down on the longfingered , well-kept one that lay limply on the coverlet , and to my surprise it stirred . Without opening his eyes the man muttered : " Miss Blair ? " I bent closer over him and whispered , " Yes , this is Margot Blair  --  and you are Anselmo Colin , are n't you ? Do n't try to talk yet if it 's hard for you . " His eyelids flew open , and to my astonishment his black eyes were fully conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that nurse ? " 30 DESIGN IN DIAMONDSI made a gesture with my head . The nurse was apparently engrossed in her magazine . " How 'd I get here ? Who brought me ? " he demanded in a whisper . " You were struck by an auto and brought in as an accident case . " His lips twitched . " I was thrown out of an auto , you mean . But did they get  --  did they find out ? " I pressed his hand to stop him . " Do n't try to talk . I 'll tell you what you want to know . They kidnaped you from the apartment , apparently intending to take your place and keep your appointment with me . But Mr. Graham "  --  I introduced him with a nod  --  " Corey Graham and I got there first and found that cryptic message of yours . " " Message ? " " Yes , on the magazine . " " Oh . . . . You understood it ? " His eyes had a feverish glitter . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and possibly the telephone number . She told me , when I talked with her by phone , that she was staying with your mother in Cuernavaca . " " Yes  --  that was it . " He was silent for a moment . " Those men  --  did they get any dope from you ? " " No , they did n't even see us . We got there a bit early and saw at once that something queer had been going on . There were a few spatters of blood on the hearth . Then we heard them coming back and hid in the kitchen until they left . " He gave a faint sigh of relief , but there was anxiety still in his dark eyes . " But how about the police ? Once they start running down this thing " " The police do n't know anything about it . " His eyes widened . " But I thought How 'd you find me ? " " You managed that yourself . You told the nurse to look up Norman and Blair in the phone book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost boyish smile . " Did I ? That was what I was trying to do , but I did n't think I quite brought it off . . . . But it 's too good to be true  --  that the police have n't Corey leaned closer . " Kidnaping and sudden death are all in the day 's work to this gal , fella . She had a hunch that you 'd survive without calling in the cops . If you did n't  --  well , after all , you 're merely a side issue , you know . Not exactly flattering , what ? " Anselmo 's eyes turned up to mine , and there was a gleam of something like admiration in them . " Smart , " he said . For a moment he lay quietly , gathering strength or putting his thoughts in order . Both , possibly . " I do n't like the idea of handing over this mess to a woman  --  it 's dangerous , you know . But you 're clever  --  and you 've got a man with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katrien 's in danger  --  frightful danger . " I bent closer . " Tell me exactly what you fear . " His eyes looked straight up into mine . " I was followed from Mexico . The Germans are after her money . We did n't dream , when I left Mexico , that they knew she was there . But it 's quite obvious that they 've kept an eye on her all this time , since she left Holland . . . . You know that I 'm in love with her  --  that we 're going to be married ? " " Yes . She told me . " " She 's had the devil of a time . Her father died in a concentration camp  --  he was there a couple of years . She managed to escape from the country after his death and finally got to me in Mexico , after months of pretty tough traveling . She 's shot to pieces , physically and nervously , and of course she has n't a cent that she can get her hands on . That does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all hers if she wants it . But she wo n't get well until she gets this money business straightened out . I'm32 DESIGN IN DIAMONDSafraid there will be difficulties . Dutch money in this country is frozen , is n't it ? " " This is n't , " I said . " Her father took the precaution of transferring his fortune to the firm of Norman and Blair , of which I am a partner . " There was a frown on his forehead . " You mean it 's not Katrien 's property any longer ? " I smiled . " Not exactly . We 're holding it in trust for her . There are certain formalities , of course . I 'll have to get in touch with her personally  --  pass certain papers  --  make sure exactly what she wants done with the money . " " I see . She thought I could handle it all at this end . " " I 'm afraid not . " I said it positively . The day 's developmentshad settled my mind as to that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Blair , " he said . " Mexico ! Good grief , I ca n't do that ! " " She 's in mortal danger , Miss Blair . And so , I 'm afraid , are you . They know you 've got the jewels and they wo n't stop at anything . If they 'd let me out of this damn bed I could take care of it for you . But under the circumstances , for her sake and for your own , you must go and get the thing settled up in a hurry . Believe me , there 's no time to lose . I know . I heard them talking . " His eyes had a feverish , too-bright look in them , and his low voice had a sudden strained , husky sound . The nurse evidently heard the change in its quality , for she put down her magazine and came briskly to the bedside . " I think the patient has talked long enough , " she said . " Just one minute ! " Anselmo Colin put out his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us alone for a minute longer  --  then I 'll be good . I promise . " " Well , just a moment , " she conceded reluctantly , and stepped out into the corridor , closing the door behind her . Colin 's fingers held mine tensely . DESIGN IN DIAMONDS 88 " You 'll go , Miss Blair ? " I nodded . " Yes , I 'll go . Now stop worrying and put your mind on getting well . Any special messages for Katrien ? " " Only that I love her and I 'll be back as soon as they let me out of here . " A flicker of a smile crossed his lips . " You will probablyrun into a chap by the name of Dirck van Ryper , a lifelongneighbor of Katrien 's in Amsterdam . He helped her escape , and they 've been through a lot together . He 's in love with her , and she 's very grateful to him . So look out for my interests , will you ? " I raised an eyebrow . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head . At the slight movement a grimace of pain touched his lips , but the smile was still there . " No , Katrien belongs to me , and Dirck is actually a swell hombre . But do n't let him get any ideas . " The nurse came back just then with something in a glass . " You will have to leave now , " she said firmly , and held the door suggestively open . " Do n't worry , Senor Colin , " I said . " We 'll look out for her until you get home . And I promise you that her father 's wishes  --  and hers  --  will be carried out . " " Thanks , " he said softly , and we went out . CHAPTER VIEVEN IN WARTIME there are ways to cut red tape when important things are at stake . I do n't know how much Corey told his chief , but the wheels of officialdom began to spin instantly and the intricacies of travel to smooth out . Inside of twenty-four hours we were aboard the plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guardia Field that we again caught sight of34 DESIGN IN DIAMONDSthe man named Karl . I was standing idly beside the booking counter , waiting for Corey to complete the formalities , when I saw him through the door of the coffee shop . He was in profile , but there was no mistaking those hulking shoulders and the gross outline of his features . He was deep in conversation with a small light-haired man with a sharp nose and an apologetic manner . A little galvanic shock ran through me at the realization that , unless this was one of the most incredible of coincidences , our movements must have been under constant observation . I have been trailed before ; I have even felt a certain fillip of adventurous exhilaration in the knowledge that I was being shadowed , but this gave me a different feeling altogether . Alwaysbefore , it had been a matching of my own wits against those of another person on more or less even terms . But in this case it was as though my puny strength were pitted against some inhuman , gigantic machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I followed him docilely out of the rotunda and down the ramp toward the field . But as soon as I was certain we were beyond observation I said , sotto voce : " Do n't look now , but the villain is still pursuing us . " " Hunh ? " he muttered , staring at me . " Karl . He 's in the coffee shop , talking to a little man who looks as much like a rat as Karl does like a pig . " Corey 's look of consternation and self-reproach would have been amusing if I had not had exactly the same feelings myself . " I 'm a sap ! Anybody but a born idiot would have known they 'd put a tail on us . But me  --  I 've practically handed them our itinerary on a silver platter . " I laughed ruefully . " We were n't cut out for intrigue , Corey . We 're just a couple of one-track minds . But at any rate , weknow they 're on our trail -- and they do n't know we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the lucky chance which hadgiven me that glimpse of them in the coffee shop . For just beforeDESIGN IN DIAMONDS 35the steward shut the plane door for the take-off the little man whom we had dubbed the " Rat " darted in and took the one empty seat . We did not see Karl again . The Rat was one of those inconspicuous little men who might have accompanied us in a rocket to the moon without attracting our notice . Through the long restless night he lay back in his seat , apparently motionless , with his hat over his face . And the next day , when we took off from Brownsville on the last lap of our journey , we discovered , to our astonishment , that he was not aboard . As a matter of fact , we never saw him again . It was about five o'clock in the afternoon of the second day when we reached Mexico City . Fortunately I had a tourist 's acquaintance with the country and a few Spanish phrases  --  enough to cope with taxi drivers and porters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as I had had a hot bath I put in a call to Anselmo Colin 's mother in Cuernavaca . There were , of course , the usual difficulties and delays involved in trying to telephone in an unfamiliar language . But at last connection was established with the Colin home and I found myself talking with a manservant who spoke fairly good but stilted English . Senora Colin , he told me , never spoke on the telephone . But when I told him that I had just arrived from New York and that I brought messages from her son he became distinctly more cordial and with florid apologies left me danglingat the end of the line while he consulted with his mistress . And presently she herself came to the telephone . She spoke rather hesitant English , but her voice was softly modulated and deliberate  --  the voice of a Mexican gentlewoman who was both cultured and charming and who , I thought , had traveled widely . I introduced myself and told her I had seen Anselmo only two days before . It hardly seemed necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I passed lightly over the occasion of our meeting , explaining only that he would be remaining in New York for a week or two longer. 36 DESIGN IN DIAMONDS " Where are you staying ? " she asked . " At the Geneve . " " I will have a car call for you at once . In twenty minutes if you can be ready . It will get you here in time for dinner . " She spoke as though it were a matter which permitted no argument . " I really could n't impose on you that way " I started to protest , but she went right on , with a sort of gentle determination : " I could not permit a friend of Anselmo 's to spend her first night in Mexico at the Geneve . The trip is not long  --  I think it will not tire you unduly . And of course Senor Graham will come with you . In half an hour , shall we say ? " Afterward I was to look back on that telephone conversation and wonder why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time it seemed much simpler not to do so . In any case , it appeared that I should be in Cuernavaca myself within a couple of hours . I was very tired from the trip , and there was a sort of gracious , gentle determination in Senora Colin 's voice that swept me into grateful acquiescence . " Thank you . We 'll be ready , " I said . I had forgotten the magic of that drive to Cuernavaca . In fact , I had made the trip only once before , and that in broad daylight . Tonight , under a serene , star-sprinkled sky , with the breath-taking immensity of Mexico unfolding about us , it was a trip through some fantastically beautiful fairyland . The high-powered car traveled along the straight modern boulevard that took us beyond the city limits and out across the flat expanseof the lava flow . And presently the road swept up into the mountains that reared , somber and magnificent , against the sky . Below , the valley of Mexico was a limitless carpet of black velvet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , and farther off the star dust and gilded tracery of the pattern that was the city we had left . DESIGN IN DIAMONDS 87Beside me Corey broke what was for him an unprecedented silence . " Gosh ! Is this the same world they 've got a war in ? " I had been thinking that very thing . It seemed incredible that such beauty could be a country at war  --  that even tonight , as back through the centuries of her brave and turbulent history , the lovely land that is Mexico should be joined in a lifeand-deathstruggle for freedom of thought and action  --  a struggleagainst the encroachments of a system that would once more enslave her people . This , I thought , is one of the reasons why we are fighting  --  why we ca n't stop until the system is crushed , completely and for all time . This is our neighbor  --  this magnificent , gallant country . If no other good thing comes out of this war , pray God we may have learned to forget the things which have kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together from this time forward , shoulder to shoulder , for our common good . A big car passed us , traveling fast , while we were still climbingthe open road . A few minutes later the mountains closed in about us , black and awesome , and there was nothing to be seen except the rocky roadside and the upright boles of great trees as the headlight beams touched them , and a gleaming ribbon of road that unwound , twisting sinuously , before us . We passed through the huddle of huts and lighted cantinas that was Tres Cumbres and plunged into the darkness of the mountains again . I had not realized how tired I was . The smooth motion of the car and the soft purr of the engine were almost like a drug to my weary senses . My head rested comfortably on the cushioned back of the seat , and my eyelids dropped . I was not conscious of the passage of time . But suddenly the car gave a grinding lurch as Carlos , our driver , twisted the wheel sharply and jammed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of headlights was in my eyes , and I heard the roar of the approaching car that shot out around a jutting88 DESIGN IN DIAMONDSshoulder of rock . It was far over on our side of the road , and at our right , under our very wheels , it seemed , the mountainside dropped sheer to the valley floor below . Corey yelled something and flung his body across mine in an instinctive , futile gesture of protection . Then came the clash of mudguards , and our car tilted over on its side so that I seemed to be looking straight down on the twinkling lights far below . I closed my eyes . And felt something give grindingly and the car drop back on its own four wheels again as the other car roared away down the twisting road . Carlos was cursing in Spanish , steadily , fluently . He threw open the door and got out . Corey wiped his forehead and snorted explosively . " That one sure caught me off base ! I 've heard about Mexican drivers , but I did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head . . . I guess I 'll take a look at the damage . " He opened the left-hand door and joined Carlos in the road , and I heard them exchanging comments in low angry voices . I did n't get out . In fact , my muscles felt like half-set gelatine , and I was perfectly content to sit still and wait for Corey 's report . Presently Carlos opened the rear compartment and got out some tools , and I heard the clink of metal at the back of the car . And after a few minutes they both got in , and Carlos started the motor and slipped in the clutch cautiously . " She sounds all right , " Corey said , leaning forward over the driver 's shoulder . Carlos grunted acquiescence and went into second . Corey settled down beside me . " Luck was with us that time . The rear bumper tore loose , or we 'd have been over the edge , sure as shooting . The mudguard 's crumpled up , and the running board , but nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that guy 's number , though . He belongs behind bars . " DESIGN IN DIAMONDS 89I did n't answer . I felt physically sick , and I could only sit tensely , with quivering nerves and thumping heart and questions  --  confused , terrifying questions  --  spinning in my brain , until we rounded the last dizzy turn and saw the yellow lights of Cuernavaca shining reassuringly just below . The narrow cobbled streets tumbled haphazardly down the hillsides , and the car threaded its way along them cautiously . Presently the chauffeur drew up before a narrow door which was like a dozen others in a block-long row studding the plaster wall that ran flush with the street . He got out and came around the car to open the door . Corey stared at that uninviting facade and turned to me with a comical look of disillusionment . " If this is how the upper crust lives in Mexico , give me a hotel , " he muttered . " Say , ca n't we get out of it somehow ? " " Climb out , you dope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try not to leap to conclusions . You 'll learn , when you 've been down here a bit , that the Mexican aristocrat does n't go in much for vulgar display . He reserves the charms of his home for those who are fortunate enough to get inside . " Then the narrow door was opened by a dark-faced servant in a white coat , and we followed him along a corridor lighted only by a hanging wrought-iron lantern and into a patio open to the sky . As we passed through we had a swift impression of trees covered with masses of bloom and colonnades on either side with dark rooms beyond . Then we went through a grilled archway and out onto the tiled terrace . Behind me I heard Corey give a grunt of astonishment . " This way , please , " murmured the servant , and led the way up a curving staircase , plaster-walled , to a second-floor suite that was apparently quite separate from the rest of the house . There were two charming chambers , a bathroom tiled in blue majolica , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tables . DESIGN IN DIAMONDS " Dinner will be served in fifteen minutes , " he said , and departedsilently . " Whew ! " Corey whistled softly . " I take it all back and swear I never said it ! This is some dump ! Say , Margot , do you think Mrs. Colin would take another poor little refugee to board ? " " If she would , " I said dryly , " I 'm likely to be a permanent fixture . I would n't take that trip again for a million dollars . Corey , did that little mishap of ours look like an accident to you ? " He gave me an odd look . " Thought of that , did you ? So did I. But it 's screwy , of course . What good would it do to bump us off ? " " It would be one sure way to keep us from making contact with Katrien . " " But you 've got the jewels , " he objected . " So has Felix . And of course we 've arranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get them by establishing her own identity . But these people who are trying to get their hands on them could n't possibly know the details of the arrangements . I think they simply do n't want us to join forces with Katrien . " " Could be , " said Corey morosely , " but I must say they 've got a nasty way of keeping us apart . " " Well , it did n't work , " I pointed out cheerfully , " and just as soon as I 've washed my face and powdered my nose I intend to have a little heart-to-heart talk with Katrien that will , I hope , put an end to all this . " CHAPTER VIIBUT WHEN we went down to dinner a few minutes later , we found Senora Colin alone . The dining room was a stately , shadowyDESIGN IN DIAMONDS 41room with a beamed ceiling and windows sunk deep in embrasuresin the massive walls , and the furnishings were of dark old wood , intricately carved . She sat waiting at the head of the table  --  an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black , highcollareddress which might have been in fashion thirty years ago . The light of tall white tapers illumined an autocratically poised head , a long , lined face which must once have been beautiful , and a pair of magnificent black eyes . She greeted us in the kindly , slightly formal manner of a more conventional generation . " You will forgive me for not receiving you in the Sala , " she said . " My son possibly told you that I do not walk . " I noticed then that she was sitting in a wheel chair . She motionedus graciously to seats on opposite sides of the table , and for a few minutes we chatted conventionally . When the first course was served and the servants had withdrawn I broached the subject that was uppermost in my mind . " Miss ter Broek is not here for dinner tonight ? " The black eyes turned to me with a little gleam of well-bred surprise . " Miss ter Broek ? Had you expected to find her here ? " It was my turn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told us she was staying with you . " She lifted her spoon deliberately to her lips , and her thin , erect body stiffened . " He was mistaken , " she said . " She is not here . " " But she has been ? " " No . She refused my hospitality . " Across the table Corey 's eyes met mine . I leaned toward her impulsively . " I 'm surprised . I understood from Anselmo that it was arranged for her to stay here until he returned  --  that they were to be married . " 42 DESIGN IN DIAMONDS " My son , I am afraid , made a serious error in judgment , " she said quietly . " May I suggest that we defer our discussion about the young lady until after dinner ? " " Of course , " I said , applying myself in some embarrassment to the food before me . It was , I must confess , rather an uncomfortable meal . Senora Colin guided the conversation with the skill of an experienced hostess along safe and impersonal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a sense of wary hostility in the atmosphere . I carefully avoided Corey 's eyes . It was while we were eating the main course that an incident occurred which , inconsequential as it seemed at the time , was to assume an astounding importance later on . A delicious condimentaccompanied the chicken , and by way of making conversationI praised it enthusiastically and asked Senora Colin what the ingredients were . Apparently I had blundered upon one of her especial prides . " It is mango chutney , " she said . " Made by a recipe which has been in my family for more than three hundred years . If you like it you must have a jar to take with you when you leave . . . . Roberto , please speak to one of the maids about it . " When the meal was finished a white-coated , soft-footed servantappeared without any apparent signal , and as we rose he wheeled the senora 's chair ahead of us into a small adjoining sala . She said something to him and flicked her fingers impatiently , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bearinga small carved box . He put it into her hands , and she made a gesture of dismissal . " Sit down , " said Senora Colin brusquely , and the very tone of her voice told us that she was forcing herself to a subject which was distasteful to her . " I do not understand what is your connection with Senorita ter Broek , but my son sent you to me , so I shall be quite frank with you . You are acquainted with the young lady  --  she is a friend of yours ? " aDESIGN IN DIAMONDS 43I shook my head . " No , I never met her . Her father was a friend of mine several years ago . " " Ah ! " Her tone was distinctly more cordial . " That makes my unpleasant duty much simpler . My son , I am sorry to say , had an understanding with Senorita ter Brock  --  he left here on a mission for her , believing that when he returned they would be married . That marriage , I am happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened the carved box and took out two letters . I could see that they were addressed to her in a small , neat hand . She opened one and handed me the enclosure . " She went to the airport with Anselmo when he left for the States , " she said . " It was arranged that she should return here in the car which took him there . Instead , she sent this letter . It is in English  --  she speaks Spanish with difficulty , and I , unfortunately , never learned the Dutch language , though I was in Holland for several years . " It was a single folded sheet of note paper . I ran my eyes over the closely written lines . It read : MY DEAR SENORA COLIN , I have decided not to go to Cuernavaca . I did not understand that it was so far when I said I would go . You will understand that it is more pleasant for me to stay here in Mexico City . When Anselmo returns he will bring me to see you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flores , 18 , San Angel , care of Mrs. Prather . Sincerely yours , KATRIEN TER BROEHI went over the note twice , trying to read into it any of the personality of the girl whose picture I carried in my handbag . To be sure , the picture had been taken three years ago , but surely the girl herself could not have changed her entire characterin that time . It was the picture of a sensitive , carefully reared girl with wide level eyes and a sweet , fine mouth . It did n't seem possible that that girl could have written so tactless a letter44 DESIGN IN DIAMONDSas this . It was not only a discourteous rejection of hospitality  --  it ignored one of the fundamental principles of the social structure in this country that was to be her home . In Mexico the place for a young woman without a family of her own was in the home of her affianced husband . It would have been the same , I thought , in her own native Holland . Katrien ter Broek certainly must have known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my feeling of shock must have shown in my face , for her eyes became more friendly . " I thought she must have written it in a moment of  --  hysteria , " she said . " Anselmo told me she had been through a very trying time and was in a highly nervous condition  --  and girls do very odd things when they are not well . So I sent Carlos in with a note  --  urging her to come back with him . I told her the peace and quiet of our home would restore her health , so she would be strong and well when Anselmo should return . She did not come . Instead , she sent this second note . " She held it out to me . It read : DEAR SENORA COLIN , Thank you again for your invitation , but I must explain that my engagementto Anselmo was an unhappy mistake . I do not love him . I am to be married to my old friend , Dirck van Ryper , as soon as I am a little rested . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I know now that I have always loved him . I am very sorry that Anselmo has taken that long trip about my affairs , but I know he will understand when I explain . When he returns , will you ask him to come and see me ? Sincerely yours , KATRIEN TER BROEKI do n't know how long I sat staring at the letter  --  minutes , certainly . At last I looked up and met Senora Colin 's shrewd black eyes . I shook my head slowly . " I. do n't know what to say . It is so completely unlike the kind of person I thought she was . Her father was one of the finest gentlemen I ever knew . " DESIGN IN DIAMONDS 46Her voice was warm . " It is this frightful war , I expect . Anselmohas told me a great deal about her . He knew her , you understand , in Holland , before the invasion . He gave me a very different picture  --  I had visualized her as a daughter I could love dearly . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will forgive me if I say I am glad to have found it out before she married my son . " " Perhaps I 'd better go out on the terrace and have a smoke , " Corey suggested . I caught the wry note in his voice . " With your permission , senora , " I said , and handed him the two notes . " Mr. Graham is in my confidence and in Anselmo 's too . " Corey read them hastily and laid them on the table . " Poor devil , " I heard him mutter . " If you are referring to my son , I consider that he has escaped being a poor devil by a very fortunate chance , " said Senora Colin , and I saw the faint , proud hint of a smile on her lips . " I suppose I should let him know about this . Whatever his errand was in the States , it hardly seems necessary for him to go on with it . " " You did n't know ? " I exclaimed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volunteer any information , and naturally I did not ask . " Her black eyes were direct . " Do I understand that you came down here at his request ? " " Yes . " I was thinking fast , wondering where this new developmentwould lead and how much I should tell this sharp-eyed , shrewd old lady . Anselmo 's mother was in no mood to learn that his life had been in danger  --  possibly was in danger still  --  because of his love for Katrien ter Broek . Corey 's hand , out of sight of those keen dark eyes , was signaling caution . I made my explanation matter-of-fact and unexciting . " Before the invasion of Holland , Katrien 's father left some property in my care , and Anselmo , having a passport for the States , went up to try to arrange to have it transferred to her. 46 DESIGN IN DIAMONDSBut as things were left , it can only be handed over to Katrien personally , so he asked me to come down and see that it was all done correctly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive you to town , and you will find Senorita ter Broek at the address I have given you . " Senora Colin 's tone indicated that the subject was closed . And after a few minutes more of desultory , rather strained conversation she dismissed us to our rooms , like a couple of children sent off to bed . Up on the terrace that ran along the front of our rooms Corey and I discussed this new development . " I simply ca n't believe it ! " I said . " If you 'd heard what Katrien said to me over the phone " It 's a woman 's prerogative  --  to change her mind , " he pointed out cheerily . " And Anselmo was a bit uneasy himself . Remember what he said about protecting his interests ? " " Well , I know what Katrien said , " I repeated stubbornly . " And if she 's suddenly decided to marry this Dirck What's-HisName , it 's an all-time record in mind changing , even for a woman . What 's more , if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me it is going to complicate things . In Holland does a wife 's property belong to her husband ? " Corey spread his hands . " You ca n't prove it by me . And they might be playing by Mexican rules . I would n't know about that either . . . . Oh well , maybe she has n't married him yet . " " I hope she has n't been so stupid . But you never know  --  the impulse to get married seems to rob a woman of all her native intelligence . " " You 're a traitor to your sex , " Corey grinned , tossing his cigarette over the rail . " Well , what do we do now ? We 're evidentlyexpected to go to bed . Seems like a dirty gyp  --  a night like this , and our first in Mexico . " " It does , for a fact , " I agreed , and we tiptoed down the open staircase to the patio like a pair of conspirators . We found theDESIGN IN DIAMONDS 47heavy wooden door that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room where evidently the gatekeeper lived . He came out when he heard us , rubbing his eyes sleepily , and unlocked the big door , and we passed out into the empty cobbled street . Somewhere close at hand a whistle blew . It had a strange sound , a thin , reedy wail , followed by a queer barbaric tremolo on two discordant notes , and it echoed lonesomely in the dark narrow roadway that ran between shuttered walls . I called on my meager stock of Spanish phrases . " What 's that ? " " El Velador . " The man pointed at a figure muffled to the ears in blankets , halfway down the block . As we watched he strolled to the corner , lifted his whistle to his lips , and blew it again . Behind us the gatekeeper had closed the big door . " El Velador . What a lovely name for a watchman ! " I said , slipping my arm into Corey 's as a sort of insurance against the rough pavement . " Eleven o'clock  --  and all 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go the other way . He 'd probablyrun us in as suspicious characters . Decent folks are evidentlyabed and asleep at this hour of the night . " But the night air was balmy , and the starry sky was close above our heads . We walked on and on between the rows of sleeping houses . Occasionally , farther and farther away , we heard the faint eerie wail of the Velador . It was nearly midnight when we rounded the plaza in the shadow of Cortes ' Palace and turned back toward the house we had left . It had been some minutes since we had heard the whistle . Aswe strolled down the silent , deserted street Corey mentioned it . " That watchman must have done his stuff for the night . Ithought he was too industrious to keep it up indefinitely . " " He 's probably gone out of earshot . " He shook his head with decision . " No , I think he 's taking time out for a nap . " We crossed the last intersecting alley and saw the high blank48 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the deeply embrasured door with shadows lying across it . And suddenly Corey made a little gesture with his thumb . " My guess was n't so far wrong . There he is , sitting on the step  --  looks like he 's gone back to sleep again . Probably takes a nap on every doorstep he comes to . " He looked like a little heap of blankets under a broad- brimmed sombrero . I remembered , from my previous visit , that many Mexicans have a deep-rooted fear of the poisonous effect of the night air . Evidently this watchman bundled himself up well against it . Corey lifted the quaint , antique knocker and let it fall . And after a little we heard the shuffle of feet and the grate of a rusty key , and the door creaked open . The gatekeeper had evidently been asleep . He had a blanket draped about his shoulders and a smoking lantern in his hand . " Thanks , buddy , " said Corey affably , quite oblivious of the fact that the man could not understand him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaceful mind . The watchman 's camped right here on your doorstep . " The man 's eyes were blank and uncomprehending , so I tried to explain . " El Velador , " I said , and pointed at the little heap of blan- kets in the shadows . The gatekeeper grunted something and , bending down , stirred the motionless man with his hand . It was as if the center of gravity of an inanimate object had shifted . Slowly , slug- gishly , the pile slipped sidewise , and the man sprawled across the threshold . The movement dislodged the sombrero , and it tilted ludicrously upward , revealing the man 's face and the side of his head . And suddenly it was as if an icy hand had clutched my heart. " j Madre de Dios ! " muttered the gatekeeper , and crossed himself . DESIGN IN DIAMONDS 49Corey snatched the lantern out of his hand and held it so that its dim glow fell upon the thing at our feet . I saw a lined , sagging face , a scrawny neck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temple something wet and dark and dreadful . Corey jerked the lantern aside hastily . " Too much pulque , " he muttered . " Better run along in , Margot . I 'll take care of him . " " Do n't be an idiot , " I snapped , fighting back the black nausea that threatened to overwhelm me . " I saw it . He 's dead , of course ? " " Yeah  --  no doubt of it , " he said grittily , and bent closer to make sure . Abruptly he straightened . " Must have just happened . The blood is still oozing . " We had not noticed , in the consternation of the moment , that the gatekeeper had left us , but now we heard his voice in the patio , bawling unintelligible things . I clutched at Corey 's arm . " That 's not a Mexican . " He nodded . " And it 's certainly not the watchman . Listen here , old dear , this is n't going to be nice . Go on up to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the whistle of the actual watchman shrilled not far away . And at my elbow an apologetic , urgent voice spoke : " Por favor , senorita . " It was the butler who spoke English . " The senora wishes you to come at once . And the senor , too , if you please . " " You run and tell the senora " Corey began , but the manunceremoniously shouldered us both out of the doorway and swung shut the heavy door . " What the devil are you doing ? " Corey roared . " That man 's dead ! We ca n't do this " " Come , " the man said stolidly . We looked at each other . Outside the door , very close now , the watchman 's whistle was wailing. 60 DESIGN IN DIAMONDS " We may as well go with him , " Corey muttered . " Looks like the old lady intends to be the boss of this show . We 'll get along faster with her . " Senora Colin 's own suite was close at hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting in her wheel chair in the little sitting room that opened on her bedroom . Her face had a drawn , strained look . Corey burst into voluble talk . " Did you know that there 's a dead man lying on your door- step ? " he demanded . " And not only dead , but murdered ! We almost stumbled over his body . Your man insisted that we come away . He shut the door " Yes , I know all that , " she said almost brusquely . " My servants have instructions . They will do what is necessary . " " But we found him ! " Corey expostulated . " It is better that no one should know that . Believe me , this is wise , " Senora Colin said , and her voice , for all its gentleness , had an inflexible sound . " For you who are strangers in this country , who do not speak our language , it would be a most unpleasant experience . Everything will be done that you could possibly do . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Please go to your rooms and forget that you have been outside the house at all tonight . " I opened my mouth to protest , but I realized that nothing I could say would change that stern , indomitable old lady 's mind . I turned and left the room , and Corey followed me across the patio and up the open staircase . " Let me come in a minute , " he muttered when we reached the top . He closed the door softly and motioned me to the far side of the room , where the windows looked out on the empty patio below . " I do n't suppose anybody 's trying to listen to us , but it 's just as well not to take any chances . Margot , old dear , this thing gets screwier and screwier  --  and I do n't mean screwy ha-ha . Did you see that man 's hands ? " I shook my head dumbly . DESIGN IN DIAMONDS 51 " Well , I did , when I got down on my knees to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat on under that blanket , and his shirt sleeve was pushed up . And  --  get a good hold on yourself , old-timer  --  this is going to give you a shock  --  tattooed on his forearm was the Trylon and Perispliere . " CHAPTER VIITI STARED AT HIM DUMBLY . In the dim light his ordinarily cheerful , happy-go-lucky face looked grim and oddly white . I put out a hand and fumbled for a chair . He jerked one into place and I dropped into it . My knees had suddenly refused to bear my weight . " Now wait a minute ! " I gasped . " I 've got to think . " " If you can think up the answer to this one , offhand , you 're good . " " Do n't say anything for just a minute  --  please ! " I begged . " Let me think out loud . . . . If he 's got the Trylon and Perispheretattooed on his arm he must be a bona fide messenger . Anselmo had it too  --  he put it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . The girl who phoned me "  --  I hesitated , trying to think back --  " I do n't think she actually mentioned it , but I 'm not sure . But she sent Anselmo , and he knew she was Katrien ter Broek . He 'd known her for years , and he could n't have made any mistake . " Then a sudden memory woke . " There was a servant  --  remember ? Katrien mentioned him  --  said he was utterly loyal  --  that he 'd been with the family all his life . " Corey 's closed fist thumped his other hand . " Now you 're talking ! What did she say the man 's name was ? Pete Some-thing-or-Other. " 52 DESIGN IN DIAMONDSThe name came back as clearly as if I had known it all my life . " Piet Maartens . I noticed the pronunciation  --  I remember thinking what a nice , homespun Dutch name it was . Corey , that was Piet Maartens we just found on the doorstep . I feel certain of it . " He nodded soberly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he doing in Cuernavaca ? " I shook my head slowly . " It does n't make sense , does it ? One might jump to the conclusion that he was looking for us , that he was bringing us a message from Katrien . But it 's full of holes . Anselmo is the only one who knew we were coming here , but he thought Katrien was here too  --  he would n't have communicatedwith her at any other address . And how else would she know we were here ? " " She would n't . " I got to my feet with abrupt decision . " Well , she 's going to know it  --  right now ! " " Atta girl ! What you going to do ? " " Telephone to her . I 'm going to tell her what 's happened to Piet Maartens . She 's the one who should be notified . " Corey scowled uncertainly . " Well , now , I do n't know , Margot . This thing 's got a lot of angles " There 's just one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man out there .

" His fingers ruffled his hair worriedly . " Well , if you put it like that  --  no . Naturally , she 's responsible . But the guy was murdered  --  don'tforget that . And we do n't know why  --  or who by . Are you going to tip your hand without knowing what you 're up against ? " DESIGN IN DIAMONDS s3I eyed him . thoughtfully .

" " You may have something there , " I said . " And , as you say , I 've got Katrien 's money . I ought to be able to arrange to have Piet Maartens suitably interred myself . " " Now you 're cooking with gas ! " he said enthusiastically . " But how are you going to manage it ? Rich , bighearted Americanwoman with a special yen for showy funerals ? " " It 'll have to be something like that , I guess , " I admitted with a faint smile . " Unless you can think of something more dignified . But we 'll have to act at once .

" I 'm merely recognizing the obvious . If I ca n't convince her of my pure altruistic intentions I certainly could n't convince the police . Besides , she 'll have to make the arrangements for me or see that it 's done . I could n't cope with the official red tape of Mexico .

She was still in her wheel chair . " Please forgive me for intruding at this hour , " I apologized . " I wo n't keep you but a few minutes . " " You may leave us , Roberto , " she said curtly with a flick of her long white fingers . The door closed softly , and she turned to me . " What is it , Miss Blair ? " " I wanted to speak to you about that poor man who was murdered on your doorstep , " I began , and suddenly , under the level gaze of those shrewd old eyes , I felt that I was putting myself in a rather ridiculous light . " Do they know who he was ? Has he a family ? " " No . There were no identifying papers on him . And he was not a resident of this town . " " What do they do in such cases ? About burial , I mean . " A slight flicker of distaste crossed her face . " Just as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What we call a pauper 's grave ? " " Yes .

Now , you 'll probablythink it a sentimental gesture , but I 'd like to defray the cost of proper burial for him . Could you arrange it ?

Later , when all has been accomplished , you may reimburse me . Now if that is all , shall we say good night ? Or good morning , rather . It is almost two o'clock .

CHAPTER IXSENORA COLIN did not appear to speed us on our way the next morning . Roberto brought me a courteously worded note in which she referred to a sleepless night and a resultant headache and hoped that we would both return at some future date , if our other engagements permitted . I handed it to Corey , and he read it with an expressionless face . But when Roberto had withdrawn he indulged in an inelegant snort. 56 DESIGN IN DIAMONDS " Something tells me that 's one invitation we 're going to be just too frightfully busy to accept . I would n't call that exactly cordial , would you ? " " Well , I really do n't know as I blame her , " I said , and put on my hat . " Thank goodness we can tell Anselmo the whole story and settle the funeral bills through him . Then he can tell his mother as much , or as little , as he wishes . " Carlos was waiting for us in the car . I glanced at the gleamingfenders and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another car this morning , " I said . " Si , senorita . The other is being repaired . " His face was impassive , as a well-trained servant 's should be . Just then one of the maids came running through the gate with a small parcel in her hand . " The mango chutney , senorita , " she explained . I thanked her and Carlos started the car . And suddenly , without any warning , I felt an odd pounding in my heart  --  a queer feeling in my muscles . I might have attributed it to the changes in altitude I had experienced in the past twenty-four hours , but I did n't . I knew suddenly that I was afraid  --  afraid , even in broad daylight , of the curving mountain road , and the precipices that dropped sheer to the valley floor below , and the unknown malevolent thing that seemed to be following us . I leaned forward and touched Carlos on the shoulder . " Momentito , Carlos . " He stepped on the brake and turned a questioning eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether there is any other road back to Mexico City  --  besides the one we carne over last night ? " He nodded . " Si , senorita , by Cuautla . But it is much farther that way . " " Let 's take it , " I said . " Mr. Graham and I are strangers inMexico . We would like to see as much as we can of the country . " " Si , senorita , " Carlos said briefly , and wheeled the car . Buthis black eyes had a sudden gleam in them as he glanced back atDESIGN IN DIAMONDS 57me , and his teeth showed white in a quickly suppressed smile that was comprehending and at the same time reassuring . At my side Corey chuckled under his breath . " You sure learn fast , lady , " he said admiringly . The Cuautla road was rough and very dusty , but it ran through wide open country , and if there were any other cars on it we did not see them . At Cuautla we piked up the wellpavedroad leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rectangle , of which the direct road from Cuernavaca to Mexico City was the fourth . But we did not mind the extra distance : it was a glorious morning , and we traveled through magnificentcountry , with the giant snow-capped peaks of Ixtacihuatland Popocatepetl marching with us to the east . Moreover , we had a good deal to talk about and plans to make . I was determined , before going any farther , to get in touch with Katrien herself , find out what I could of Piet Maartens ' movements , and learn , if possible , what had brought about her sudden extraordinarychange of heart . Upon the results of this conversation our next moves would depend . At the peaceful little town of Amecameca we directed Carlos to find us a telephone , and he drew up before a provincial little inn . We had decided , in order to keep the fact of my own presence in Mexico a secret from her until I chose to divulge it , that Corey should do the talking , representing himself as a friend of Anselmo 's from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble . Corey put in the call , and I sat down in the near-by patio to wait . It was some moments later that he joined me , and he was scowling as he sat down at my side . " Did you talk to her ? " I demanded . He took out a cigarette case , selected a cigarette , and lighted it deliberately before he answered . " No , I did n't . " " Well , who did you talk to ? What 's the matter with you , 58 DESIGN IN DIAMONDSCorey ? " I snapped . " Do n't go enigmatic on me ! My nerves wo n't take it this morning . " He drew deeply on the cigarette and let the smoke drift out through his nostrils . " I 'm thinking . Naturally you would n't recognize the symptoms " Is something actually wrong with her ? " He shook his head . " I would n't know . Nothing you could put your finger on , but in view of everything else Oh , I du n no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Suppose you repeat the conversa-tion . " " Well , I talked to this Mrs. Prather first , and if there 's anythingphony about her , then my aunt Emma in Schenectady is a gunman 's moll . American , from the sound of her , and one of the nice sociable kind . Asked me to dinner , if you 'll believe it , before I 'd hardly gone into my song and dance . " " I suppose you did ask to speak to Katrien , " I said tartly , " or were you too busy making dinner dates ? " " Hold your horses , sweetheart . I 've got to do this my way . Yes , I told her I wanted to speak to Katrien  --  that I was a friend of her fiance 's . Did n't mention which fiance , you notice . Pretty cagey  --  what ? And she said Katrien was sick  --  could n't come to the phone " " Sick ! " He nodded . " Funny thing about it was I had an idea she was telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . Convincing . She was downright motherly  --  told me how poor little Katie had been through six months of pure hell , and her nerves had finally cracked under the strain . " " When ? " " Last Monday . " Corey 's eyebrow cocked up significantly . " Could be , what ? " I nodded thoughtfully . " Yes , it certainly could be . It would explain a lot . . . . Well , what then ? " DESIGN IN DIAMONDS 59 " She said , since I was a friend of her fiance 's , why did n't I speak to him ? So I said why not , and she summoned this guy Dirck . And damn it , he sounded like a swell guy too . " " He knew , I suppose , " I said sarcastically , " that you were no friend of his ? " " Oh , sure . I put him straight on that , and we exchanged nice hearty apologies , like a couple of little gentlemen . Then I cooked up a yarn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how I was supposed to follow through on it while Anselmo was in the States  --  and where could I find Piet ? " " And " I prodded . " Well , I had an idea he hesitated , as if he was caught off balance . But I might have been mistaken . It was n't more than a split second , anyway . Then he said Piet had gone to Vera Cruz and had n't got back yet . If I 'd leave my number he 'd have him get in touch with me as soon as he did . " " Vera Cruz ! What for ? " Corey shrugged . " Oh , that sounded all on the up-and-up too . It seems Katrien had some bags which they had to abandon somewhere in their wanderings . According to him , they worked their way up through South America . The bags were supposed to be sent along by a little freighter that sneaks up the coast to Vera Cruz now and then , and Piet went down to see if they 'd got there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But  --  I du n no " That 's the second time you 've made that highly intelligent observation , " I pointed out . " Well , we seem to be just about where we were . What do we do now ? " He ran his fingers through his hair . " Gosh , I du n no . " " Stop saying you du n no ! Neither do I , but I 'm not talking about it ! What kind of place is this Mrs. Prather 's ? Is she a personal friend of theirs ? Or did n't it occur to you to find out ? " He looked hurt . " I may be dumb , but now and then I do crash through . Remember the salary you used to pay me before the60 DESIGN IN DIAMONDSwar ? You did n't give it to me because of my radiant person- ality . " I had to smile in spite of myself . " Oh , I know you 're good , Corey  --  and you know I know it . Come on , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of a glorified boardinghouse  --  paying guests , you know , but only the elect may apply . She explained to me herself that she does n't take anybody unless she 's sure she can introduce them socially . They had irreproachable letters , it appears , and Katrien , of course , could go anywhere on the strength of her name . Mrs. Prather had visited in Holland before the war and knew all about the Ter Broeks . " " She did n't happen to mention whether she had an empty room , I suppose ? " Corey stared at me . " Do you mean what I think you mean ? " " Yes , " I said shortly . " And here 's a little job that 's right down your alley . As soon as we get to town you 're going to manufacture credentials for me that will make Mrs. Prather 's social soul rejoice .

" I wo n't make speeches informing the Mexican people that we have dis- covered that they have a glorious but hitherto wholly unsus- pected history , art , and culture . " He grinned . " Better make it women 's clubs . That 's always good for indiscriminate snooping  --  and you wo n't have to show any results . Nobody will insist on perusing your report to the Thwarted Sisterhood .

As a matter of fact , the suggestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study of women 's activities . And the funny part of that is , I may actually do it . You 'd be surprised how much I know about women 's activities . I even belong to a women 's club . " " Feet of clay ! " he groaned irrepressibly . " I always suspectedyou had ' cm ! " CHAPTER XDESPITE his wisecracking tongue and irresponsible manners , Corey Graham is one of the most ingenious men in the promotionbusiness . His contacts are limitless , and he has a phenomenalcapacity for putting them to work . I never ask him how he accomplishes his most spectacular results ; I merely acceptthem at face value and bless the day we put him on our pay roll . We put up once more at the Geneve , and Corey advised me to get in a bit of sight-seeing and promptly departed on what he termed " a spot of wire pulling . " We had debated whether I should use my own name while making my preliminary survey of the situation . My cautious soul inclined toward a fictitious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Corey sensibly pointed out the complications of such a course in a foreign country and managed to convince me that if we were actually under surveillance changing my name would n't do any good and might even do harm . We finally agreed that I should continuein my own identity . Privately I intended to have a little talk with Katrien before we met in public and suggest that until62 DESIGN IN DIAMONDSour business was actually concluded it might be wiser not to mention it . It was about ten o'clock the next morning when the telephone rang in my room at the Geneve . I answered , and in spite of my thorough conditioning to Corey 's apparent miracles , I was wholly unprepared for the pleasant American voice that said : " Miss Blair ? This is Ellen Prather . Alicia Danvers just called and told me you were in town . " My faculties were in a complete tailspin . I heard my own voice repeating : " Alicia Danvers ? " " At the Pan-Hellenic Club , you know . She 'd just had a wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit . " Oh yes , of course ! From dear old Julia ! " How Corey could possibly have known that Julia Grier Hat- field , now one of the most influential members of the Council of Professional Women of America , had been my roommate in college was one of life 's profoundest mysteries , but evidently he did . As I have mentioned , Corey managed to tuck away a prodi- gious amount of useful information in that irresponsible brain of his . But Ellen Prather was talking on like an amiable tor- nado , sweeping all before it . " My dear , I 'm simply thrilled to know what you 're doing ! Alicia was in a dreadful rush  --  did n't have time to tell me much about it  --  but she said Julia told her you were down here as a sort of women 's ambassador . My dear , I do n't know why no- body 's thought of it before ! If you knew the number of men who come down here for practically everything under God 's heaven ! It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I always say the Diplomatic Corps ought to be made up of women  --  they 'd quickly smooth out all these ridiculous misunderstandings that are forever popping up . Men certainly can muddy up the drinking water  --  with the best intentions in the world  --  can'tDESIGN IN DIAMONDS 63they ? Women have more tact in their little fingers than " It 's frightfully good of you to call me , " I managed to insert feebly . " My dear , I 'm utterly selfish , I assure you ! I 'm simply dying to hear all about it . And I can introduce you to all the people you want to meet . You 'll be astounded at the way these LatinAmericanwomen " I broke in again , this time firmly . After all , Corey had run my interference and tossed me the ball , but I must throw it in the basket myself . " Mrs. Prather , you 're like an answer to prayer ! You 'll be able to advise me about a place to live , I 'm sure . I certainly do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Live ! Why , my dear child , you 're coming right straight out here to me , of course ! I would n't hear of your going anywhere else . " " Oh , I could n't impose on you that way , " I protested . " I thought possibly  --  a furnished apartment " Listen , my dear , " she said decisively . " I have half a dozen people here already  --  people you 'll enjoy meeting . Have ' em all the time . And you 're not imposing on me ; I let ' em pay what it costs me . It 's my way of having int'resting people around me . Never let anybody inside my doors unless I 'm sure they can pull their own weight . Right now I 've got an archaeologist , a lady sculptress , an opera singer , and two European refugees ' 9 " Well , of course , since you put it that way , I 'm flattered , " I said hastily . " I have an assistant with me  --  a young man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner table " " Oh , I 'm sorry ! " She sounded as if she meant it . " I have n't but one empty room in the house  --  would n't have that , but the man who was occupying it , a geopolitician from Vienna , went up to the States . He was such an int'resting person  --  I wish you could have known him  --  had a new theory about political and national realignment after the war , based on " 64 DESIGN IN DIAMONDS " Could he find a room near by ? " " A room ? Dr. Farburg ? . . . Oh , you mean your assistant  --  so stupid of me ! Yes , of course . There 's a nice little inn just around the corner . . . . Well , then it 's all settled , is n't it ? You get a taxi and come right out  --  the address is Calle Flores , 18 . The house is called Casa del Seto . " " Thank you . Yes , I 'll be out in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather breathless . In the open doorway Corey was grinning at me . " My fine Italian hand has n't lost its cunning  --  what ? " I drew a deep breath and shook my head . " No , Corey , you 're still a wizard . But sometime , just for a change , why do n't you let me tell you about it ? " When the taxi drew up at the gate of Casa del Seto I sat for a moment looking the place over and feeling much as I imagine Daniel must have felt as he prepared to step into the lions ' den . Except that in the biblical case Daniel had a fairly clear idea what he was up against . The grounds occupied the equivalent of an entire city block bordered by winding , tree-shaded lanes . Mrs. Prather had told me there was an inn near by , but I had seen no other building in the immediate vicinity . It was hidden , undoubtedly , by the trees and the rank growth of shrubs and flowering vines . Casa del Seto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hedge House  --  was well named . Flush with the bordering lanes on all four sides ran a stone wall about three feet high , and above that an ancient cedar hedge rose to a height of possibly twelve feet , thickly intertwined , impenetrable . A massive wrought-iron gate was apparently the only entrance . There was a bell pull on the gatepost . I yanked on it and heard the distant tinkle of the bell . And after some moments a little Indian girl of perhaps twelve years appeared with a key . She was barefooted and wore her black hair in two pigtails ; herDESIGN IN DIAMONDS 65little brown hands wrestled with the lock , and after some difficultyshe managed to swing open the heavy gate . " Buenos dias , senorita , " she breathed , her big black eyes sober and wary . " Buenos dias , " I responded . " Senora Prather ? " She murmured something softly and gestured , and I followed her down the flagged path that led through a ragged garden where love-in-a-mist , calla lilies , and snapdragons ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tall black cypresses and under an arbor of flaming bougainvillaea . I suppose my mood was sensitive to atmosphere that morning , but it seemed to me that the mind which had planned Casa del Seto and set out those somber evergreens and blazing flower gardens must have been subject to alternating fits of melancholiaand gaiety . There was a strange , wild beauty about it , and at the same time something depressing , almost funereal . Then we passed through another tall hedge  --  this time the trees were Lombardy poplars  --  and came out on a smoothly clipped green lawn surrounded by carefully tended flower beds . Beyond , we saw the house  --  gray stucco , with flowering vines climbing over it . I recognized old garden favorites  --  heliotrope , lemon verbena , geranium  --  climbing almost to the roof of the two-story house . A woman was bending over the rosebushes . She put down a wicker basket of cut flowers and a big pair of shears and came to meet me , pulling off her canvas gloves . " Hello . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freckled brown hand . She might have been in her late forties  --  a comfortably stout woman in a dowdy green smock . Her face was tanned and innocentof cosmetics , and wisps of straight sandy hair straggled from under the broad-brimmed Chinese coolie hat she wore . " I 'm simply delighted to see you ! " she said , and her greengrayeyes snapped with evident satisfaction . " Knew I 'd like66 DESIGN IN DIAMONDSyou the minute I heard your voice ! That 's a good-looking suit  --  want to sell it ? " I shook my head , smiling . " In wartime ? Hardly . " She shrugged philosophically . " I suppose not . Have n't been in the States for five years  --  wo n't go now till the war 's over . . . . Luisa "  --  she lapsed into swift Spanish  --  " the seuorita 's bags ! Have Pedro take them to her room . . . . Come along , Miss Blair . Do n't mind stairs , I hope ? " " Not at all , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a tremendous living room with a fireplace at each end , and along an open-air corredor . On the right , through a series of plastered arches built in the Spanish manner , one looked down on a tiled swimming pool with water that was jewelbluein the sunshine . On the left was a series of rooms , each with its brightly painted door giving on the open corredor . In the angle at the far end , a pink-plastered circular staircase with polychrome banisters twisted up to the second floor . It was all very gay  --  oddly at variance with the somber approach to the house . " This is the guest wing , " Ellen Prather said with a brisk wave of the hand . " My husband and I live in that wing back there , opening into the living room . This way , the guests can have their place to themselves , and we "  --  her green eyes twinkled  --  " canhave ours . Your room is up on the second floor . " We mounted the circular staircase , and she threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wing , with windows on three sides . Through a half-open door I saw a bathroom tiled in rose and gray . Through the windows I could look out over the tops of the cedars to the misty peak of the mountain that bore the affectionate nickname of " Popo . " " What a charming room ! " I exclaimed , and slipped with apparentcasualness into the subject that was uppermost in my mind . " Now tell me about my fellow guests . Who 's up here with me ? " DESIGN IN DIAMONDS 67 " Only one other at the moment . In that other corner room . " Mrs. Prather 's rather strident voice lowered cautiously . " And I doubt if you 'll see her for a few days . She 's a refugee , poor girl , from Holland . She comes of a very fine family , but of course they lost everything at the time of the invasion . She 's feeling the effects of all she 's gone through . Luckily her fiance is with her  --  Dirck van Ryper  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school of one of the big universitiesover there . " " She 's ill ? " I put in . She nodded . " Nervous breakdown . But Dr. van Ryper thinks all she needs is rest and complete freedom from worry or anythingunpleasant . I guess she 's had enough of that to last for her lifetime . She seems to be a darling girl . . . . The room at the end of the lower corredor belongs to Dr. Lewers , an archaeologist who is writing a book on pre-Aztec civilizations . He happens to be in Yucatan now , but we expect him back very shortly . " " Dr. van Ryper , then , is downstairs , too ? " " Yes , right under you . Anna Gregor , the sculptress , is down on that floor ; she does such fascinating things with Mexican primitives , you know . And Sean O'Shane , the Irish tenor who is singing leading roles in the opera this winter .

" " It sounds like an interesting household , " I said . " I hope I can hold up my end . " " I have no doubt of that , " she observed dryly . " As a matter of fact , we 've got a slight preponderance of temperament and eccentricity in the house at the present time . Brilliant  --  but difficult , if you know what I mean . Fritz and I will be glad to have someone around who speaks our language . " 68 DESIGN IN DIAMONDS " Fritz ! " I exclaimed involuntarily . " My husband . " Her green eyes showed sudden amusement . " It 's an old family name  --  originally , I believe , Swedish . . . . Well , I 'll leave you . Lunch is at one-thirty . " I heard her steps go down the winding staircase . Then from my window I watched the green smock go along the corredor and disappear . A moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little hallway to the opposite one , and tapped on it with cautious fingers . There was no answer , and after a moment I knocked again , more insistently . And presently a voice spoke , hesitantly , almost fearfully . " Yes ? Who is it ? " " A friend , Katrien . May I come in ? " I did not wait for her answer but turned the knob and walked in . She was sitting in a chair by the window with an embroidered silk shawl around her shoulders , as if she were cold . Her big dark eyes had a startled look in them , and at sight of that thin pinched face and that drawn mouth with the under lip caught tight between her teeth as if to stop its trembling , I wanted to put my arms about her and hold her tight . For an instant , aghast at what the past dreadful three years had done to the lovely , glowing girl whose picture her father had given me , I could n't speak . Then I said gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've come to take care of you . I 'm Margot Blair . " " To take care of me ? But  --  why ? " Her voice was a husky whisper , as if she found it hard to talk . " Because your father would want me to . Do n't you understand , Katrien ? I 'm Margot Blair  --  you talked to me on the telephone just the other day . " " Margot  --  Blair ? " Katrien 's dark eyes looked suddenly as if a film had slipped over them , and she put up a trembling handDESIGN IN DIAMONDS 69to her forehead in a fumbling , uncertain gesture . " I  --  I 'm afraid I do n't remember . " CHAPTER , XITxis WAS something I had n't counted on . I looked into Katrien ' 8 clouded dark eyes and my heart sank . If , as I suspected , she had actually slipped into a world of her own where she could escape from unhappiness , then it was going to be even more difficult than I had anticipated to discharge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as her father would have wished . I leaned forward and put my hand down on hers . It was cold and unresponsive . " Listen , Katrien , " I said gently . " I was your father 's friend . I promised him , if ever anything happened to him , that I would be your friend too . " Her eyes came up to mine , stony and pitiful . " My father died . They killed him . " Mentally I cursed myself for my clumsiness . " Well , then , let 's talk about Anselmo , " I suggested with an encouraging little smile . " I saw him , you know , in New York . He sent you his love and he asked me to tell you " An unhappy shadow of a frown flickered across her face , and she gave her head a quick shake , as if to rid herself of something distasteful . " I do n't want Anselmo , " she whispered . " I want Dirck . " " But you 're going to marry Anselmo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You told me over the phone  --  " " No . " Her voice was suddenly strong . " He does n't know  --  he does n't understand how it was . He knew us when we were  --  70 DESIGN IN DIAMONDShappy . Dirck understands . I 'm going to marry him . " Her eyes narrowed ; they looked bright and antagonistic . " And you ca n't stop me ! Nobody can stop me ! " " I would n't think of trying , if you 've made up your mind that 's what you want to do , " I said calmly . " But before I go back to New York , Katrien , there 's a bit of business we must settle . You remember that I 'm holding some of your prop-erty " Her face seemed to crumple piteously . " I could n't ! Let Dirck do it . " " I 'm afraid that wo n't do , " I said decisively . " There are papers that only you can sign , and you must understand exactly what they mean . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You explain it all to him . I 'll sign anything he tells me to . . . . Please go away . I do n't feel very well  --  my head aches . " I drew a deep breath of frustration and let it out softly as I rose . " Perhaps tomorrow you 'll feel more like talking , " I suggested . But to my horror she sprang to her feet and screamed at me in a voice that was shrill and uncontrolled . " No , I wo n't ! I 'll never feel like talking ! I wo n't  --  do n't you understand ? Please go ! " The luncheon bell was ringing . I went down the twisting staircase and found the table set on the shaded terrace and Ellen Prather already there , and with her a bluff , middle-aged man nursing a highball glass . He looked , I thought , rather like a Cruikshank drawing of a Dickens character  --  with round , rosy cheeks , a round , slightly bald head , and twinkling gray eyes with nests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flannel slacks and a sport jacket of rather pronounced brown plaid . " This is my husband , Margot , " said Ellen Prather . " And you may as well start right in calling him Fritz . We do n't use any last names here . " DESIGN IN DIAMONDS 71He shook my hand . " Glad to have you with us , Margot . You look like a white gal . Ellen 's one of those professional lion tamers , you know , but some of the animals in the menag-erie --  " " Ssst ! " Ellen warned abruptly , and turned , all cordial smiles , to greet the two who were coming through the living room . " Ah , there you are ! I want you to meet Margot Blair , who has just arrived from the States . Margot , this is Anna Gregor  --  and Sean O'Shane . " They were a picturesque pair ; appraising them swiftly , I thought that while they did not look alike in any feature , they might almost have been brother and sister . Later , trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusion that it was because , intrinsically , they were the same kind of people  --  and two people who share so many unpleasant characteristics seldom drift together unless they chance to be members of the same family . Anna Gregor was a tall , angular , ugly girl with straight black hair , moody black eyes , and a red , full-lipped , sulky mouth . She was wearing a peasant skirt of flowered cotton and a billowy , short-sleeved embroidered blouse such as Mexican girls wear on festive occasions . Sean O'Shane 's black hair was wavy and crisp , and his eyes were blue , with puffy circles under them . His features were regular and good-looking in a weak , cynical fashion . He was wearing bright blue cotton slacks and a red shirt  --  the sort of outfit I used to see on Breton fishermen in the old carefree , colorful days . They were both barelegged . Both had bare brown feet thrust into huaraches which fastened about the ankles with leather thongs . They acknowledged Ellen 's introductions perfunctorily , sat down at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point where they had apparently dropped it a discussion which includednone of the rest of us . It had to do with modern art , but I made no attempt to follow it beyond that fact . Ellen shrugged72 DESIGN IN DIAMONDSa trifle uncomfortably ; Fritz drew out a chair for me and we , too , sat down . Presently another man came out , and I guessed the instant I saw him that it was Dirck van Ryper . I had been prepared for dislike and suspicion , but at my first sight of the man my preconceivedideas received a severe jolt . He was tall , with broad shoulders and rangy limbs , and under his upstanding shock of light brown hair his blue eyes had a mild , amiable look . Impossible , somehow , to cast this man as the villain in the piece . He held my hand in a warm clasp a trifle longer than was necessary , and his eyes , looking straight into mine , seemed to recognize a common understanding and at the same time to convey a warning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I carried on an amiable but thoroughly inconsequential patter of small talk , with Dirck putting in now and then a pleasant , absent-minded comment . Fritz ate hastily and excused himself . Then Anna and Sean rose and wandered away through the house without a word of apology . And a moment later Ellen pushed back her chair . " Sorry , but I 'm playing bridge this afternoon out in the Lomas . Do you play , Margot ? I might have got a game for you . " I smiled and shook my head . " Zioncheck rummy is the extent of my card playing . Do n't worry about me . I do n't need to be entertained . " " Well , that 's a mercy ! " she said fervently , and departed . As the screen door banged shut behind her Dirck glanced at me , and one eyebrow went up significantly . We rose and strolled to the edge of the terrace . It had a broad low parapet , and he motioned me to a seat . " Have a cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me . Then deliberately he sat down , facing me . DESIGN IN DIAMONDS 73 " Just who are you , Miss Blair ? " he said . " And what 's your business with Katrien ? " " She talked to you about me ? " " Yes . You upset her pretty badly . I wish you 'd talked to me first . " I smiled . " My business , Dr. van Ryper , happens to be with Katrien  --  and no one else . " " Of course  --  under ordinary circumstances . " He sounded faintly exasperated . " But you must have realized she 's in no condition to discuss business matters . She 's been through a frightful experience . I 've been expecting something like this to happen for weeks . But she managed to hang on until she reached comparative safety . She 's got to have complete rest  --  mental as well as physical  --  or else " His shoulders went up expressively . " I 've known , of course , something about her affairs . In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got him . " In his slight hesitation over the words there was a hint of somethinghorrible . " I know , for instance , that he left considerable property in the States in trust for Katrien . I suppose you are here in connection with that . " It was a statement rather than a question . " Why not leave it in my hands ? You have documents , I suppose , to be signed ? I 'll handle it for you . " I shook my head . " There 's no special hurry about it . I 've had charge of the property for three years ; I do n't imagine a few days more will make much difference . " " But suppose it is n't a matter of a few days ? Suppose , just for the sake of argument , that she does n't improve ? " " That will be time enough to make other plans . Frankly , Dr. van Ryper , her father 's instructions to me were quite definite . Even if I wanted to , I would have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He shrugged . " Well , I can appreciate your position . And I 'd prefer it that way , of course , myself . It 's just that these things keep her upset . " 74 DESIGN IN DIAMONDSOn a sudden impulse I picked up a dry stick and began makingmarks idly in the loose gravel at our feet . And the marks I made were the outlines of the Trylon and Perisphere  --  a tall , slim , pointed spire , and beside it , cutting off one lower corner , a circle . I drew it slowly , tracing round and round the circle with the point of my stick , as if to perfect the curve . Dirck watched me a moment , then absently he , too , picked up a stick and began to doodle  --  round and round  --  but the thing he drew was a series of closely interlocking elipses . And suddenly I knew that no power on earth would persuade me to turn over Katrien 's inheritance to him . Maybe she was going to marry him  --  or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she wanted to marry him . But a few days ago , before her tired , distraught mind had escaped to its closed chamber , she had intended to marry Anselmo . And Anselmo was the one she had entrusted with the secret of the Trylon and Perisphere . I tossed down the stick and rose . " Let 's wait a few days , shall we ? I have n't had a vacation for a long while , and I 'm in no hurry to get back to the States . When Katrien feels like talking about it we can finish the businessup very quickly . " He nodded . " That will undoubtedly be best . In the meantime , do n't bother her about it , will you ? I 'll let you know when the time is right , I promise . . . . There 's one more thing , Miss Blair . " His voice held a slight and rather ingratiating hesitation . " You seem to be rather in the position of a guardian for her . What would you think of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this condition ? " He nodded abruptly . " She needs me  --  probably more now than she ever will again . And actually she 's quite like herself when she 's alone with me . It 's only with strangers I cut in brusquely : " No , I would n't do it . She 's obviously in no condition to know her own mind . I understood she was going to marry a man named Anselmo Colin . " DESIGN IN DIAMONDS 75His brows went up a bit , as if he were surprised . " Oh , you heard about that , did you ? That was all part of the persecution complex she 's been building up for the past few months . Even while we were still in Holland she thought of Colin as a possible asylum  --  his home as the one place in the world where she would be welcome  --  and safe . That was the one thing even I could n't offer her . " The blue of his eyes seemed to darken as they met mine . " You see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do for her was to share her hardships and dangers . Colin had been in love with her when he was over there several years ago , and she knew he 'd be delighted to take her in  --  that he still wanted to marry her . Poor child , you ca n't blame her for persuading herself for a little while that she was in love with him too . But she realized the truth  --  after she 'd been here a few days . " " How long have you and Katrien known each other ? " " All our lives , " he said simply . I gave him a smile . " Well , I 'm not going to take it on myself to decide which one of you she really wants to marry . She 'll have to do that for herself . But if you want my advice , you 'll wait until she 's well and not risk future unhappiness for both of you . You 'd always wonder , you know , whether she 'd have made the same choice if things had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . " I 'd take a chance on that . But maybe you 're right . " CHAPTER XIITHE BIG HOUSE seemed to doze in the late afternoon , and up there in my room at the end of the second-story wing I seemed to be cut off from all contact with the world . The sun streamed in through the western windows , draining the atmosphere of vitality and leaving it hot and dead . A long time ago Anna and76 DESIGN IN DIAMONDSSean had climbed up the ladderlike staircase that led to the studio on the roof . Since then I had had neither sight nor sound of any other human being . I felt restless and worried . Under the circumstances there was nothing to do but wait until Katrien was better , but an uneasy sense of urgency teased at my brain , prodding it to action . Somewhere , a long way off , I heard the faint , lonesome clangingof a bell and wondered idly what it was ringing for . And suddenly , in rebellion at inactivity , I threw open the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had made up my mind to walk over to the inn , find Corey , and talk over the latest developments with him . I rounded the corner of the house . Luz , one of the Indian maids , was hurrying down the path toward me . She gave me a shy smile and a " Buenas tardes " and hurried on , and I went on along the path that led through the poplar hedge . A man was sitting on one of the benches under the flowering arbor . He got hastily to his feet . " Ah , Fraulein " he began , and stopped abruptly . " Oh , I beg your pardon ! I thought it would be Fraulein ter Broek . " He was an elderly man , short and inclined to stoutness , though his well-worn suit hung on him a trifle bunchily , as though he had lost considerable weight since it was made . His grizzled hair was cut en brosse , and he wore a short gray beard . Something about his appearance told me that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I asked . " Yess . " His English was precise , but he spoke with a foreign accent  --  German , I thought . " The maid went to announce me . She instructed me to wait here . Perhaps  --  if I were to go to the door ? " " You 'd better stay right here . There 's an outside staircase just beyond that shrubbery that leads up to Miss ter Broek 's room . She 'll come this way . . . . She knows you ? She is n't seeingmany people right now . " DESIGN IN DIAMONDS 77 " She is ill ? " he exclaimed . " I am so sorry ! Perhaps I should come another day ? " I was studying him intently , wondering just what his connectionmight be with Katrien ter Broek . There was an indefinable something in his face  --  a sort of patient acceptance in the drooping lines about his mouth , a sadness in his tired gray eyes  --  that touched me . " Perhaps I can help you , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her ? " " No indeed . You are very kind . " He fumbled in the pocket of his sagging vest and drew out something wrapped in a little screw of white paper . His short stubby fingers undid it a bit clumsily , and he held it out to me . " I was bringing her  --  this . " It was a little old-fashioned brooch  --  oval , of gold filigree and black enamel and a single tiny pearl . Even as he showed it to me his hands seemed to caress it . And I knew , suddenly , that behind the visit of this pathetic little Jew was a moving human story . " Shall we sit down ? " I said . " I wish you 'd tell me where you knew Katrien ter Broek  --  I 'm a friend of hers . " He lifted his eyes to mine . " She helped us . It is two years now since we left Germany  --  wandering , wandering , all the time . Nobody wanted us , you see . She found us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mamma was sick . She was an angel from heaven . She gave us money for food and medicines . But more than that , she gave us letters  --  helped us to get special permits . It is only through her wonderful kindness that we finally were able to reach Mexico . And Mamma made me promisethat as soon as I could I would bring her this brooch as an expression of our gratitude . It was the only thing of value she had . " My throat hurt suddenly . I did n't want to say the words that forced themselves to my lips . I think I knew the answer even then. 78 DESIGN IN DIAMONDS " She could n't come with you ? " Anguish clouded for an instant those tired , elderly eyes . " Mamma died last night , " he said . " Oh , I 'm sorry , " I murmured inadequately . There seemed to be nothing more to say . " It is better so . She had been ill a long timeand she was homesick for Germany . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly and with a kind of dignity . Then he went on with a simplicity that tore my heart , " It eases the heartache a little to talk about it to a friend . That is the reason I came so soon  --  I knew Fraulein ter Broek would let me tell her about Mamma . " I rose abruptly and put my hand down impulsively on the trembling ones that held the little brooch . " Of course she will ! I 'll go and make sure she knows you are here . " Then hastily I fled . I knew that if I stayed talking with him a moment longer I should burst into tears . Luz was coming along the path . " Did you tell Senorita ter Broek that she has a guest ? " I asked . " Si , senorita . She will be down presently . She asked me to tell the senor to wait . " " Good . " I took one of the side paths leading toward the outer gate , and she went on toward the arbor . CHAPTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early evening . The gate , as usual , was locked , and while we waited for one of the maids to come and open it a car drove up and Ellen Prather got out . She greeted me effusively . DESIGN IN DIAMONDS 79 " At work already ? You norteamericanos are so frightfully energetic ! Do n't you know you ought to remain absolutely supinefor the first few days and get used to the altitude ? My dear , I lost three pesos , and I 'm in a temper ! It does seem to me that minor diplomats ' wives ought to learn to play good bridge  --  it 's one of the few things they can do to promote hemisphere solidarity ! " She paused for breath , and I introduced Corey . She pounced on him enthusiastically . " You must come right in and have dinner with us ! No , I wo n't listen to any excuses ! You 've just got here , and you ca n't possibly have any other engagements . Margot Blair tells me you 're an addition to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what with the war and every-thing . " Corey cocked an eye at her . " Did you say unattached ? My dear lady , I have n't been off the lead since this woman hooked it on three years ago ! Do n't look now , but when she turns around you 'll see the apron strings fluttering in the breeze . My figures of speech get slightly confused , but you know what I mean . " She laughed gaily , but I saw her eyes flick appraisingly from his face to mine . Luz had arrived with the key , and the gate swung open . " Well , at least that makes one less unattached woman , which is all to the good ! Take him around to the living room  --  you 'll find drinks there , Margot . Dinner is at eight . . . . Now I must run . They 're likely to serve oatmeal porridge for a first course if I do n't personally insist on soup ! " She hurried away toward the service wing , and Corey and I walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was low , and the great trees stood up black and somber on all sides , so that it was already twilight in the enclosed space . Corey gave an exaggerated shudder. 80 DESIGN IN DIAMONDS " A bit funereal in here  --  what ? I do n't wonder Katrien 's got the pip . Better watch your reflexes . This looks to me like a swell spot to develop a bad case of melancholic willies . " " Oh , come along ! " I said . " This is just atmospheric contrast . . . . That was an inspired bit of timing  --  to meet Ellen Prather at the gate . I was trying to figure out a way to have you meet the other inmates without making a special point of it . " The flowering arbor was deserted , but it brought back the memory of the pathetic little man I had left there waiting for Katrien . Halting under the fragrant canopy of bloom , I told Corey about him . He gave his head a compassionate shake . " Poor devil ! It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but his voice had a gritty huskiness , and I knew he was thinking of his own comparatively inactive role in the war and finding no words to express what he felt . Corey has a glib tongue , but he is inarticulate about the things he feels most keenly . We walked on down the path . So thickly did the trees and shrubbery stand up about this part of the garden that we might have been miles away from any human habitation , though the house , I knew , was there , hardly a stone 's throw away . We came to a branching of the path , and Corey made a little gesture with his thumb . " All these paths lead to the house ? " I speculated hastily . " That one , I should imagine , would end up in the patio where the swimming pool is . This other branch , I know , goes around through the formal garden to the front of the house . " He shrugged , his eyes roaming curiously from the oleander thicket on one side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll take your word for it that there 's actually a house somewhere in here , but I 'd like to get a look at it . That little path leading through the oleanders , for instance , looks extremely invit-ing " DESIGN IN DIAMONDS 81He broke off suddenly . I glanced at him and saw that his eyes were staring with fixed intentness at something that lay in the grass just at the edge of the footpath . It had the dull gleam of gold . With an involuntary exclamation I bent and picked it up . Then wordlessly I held it out to him in the palm of my hand . It was an old-fashioned oval brooch of gold and black enamel , with a single tiny pearl in the center . His eyes came up and met mine . " It 's the same one ? " I nodded . " Of course it is ! . . . Corey  --  I do n't like this ! " " Neither do I , " he muttered . " There 's some perfectly reasonableexplanation , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Reasonable , did you say ? " I broke in , a bit caustically , I 'm afraid . I am apt to sound irritable when my nerves begin to tingle with premonition . " If she had dropped it she would have picked it up , would n't she ? The thing was lying there in plain sight . " He nodded soberly . " It does n't seem exactly Shewould n't have tossed it away  --  a thing like that . . . . It hasn'ta great deal of value , I suppose , but " If she did , that 's all I want to know about her ! " I snapped . " But she did n't ! She may be nervous and ill  --  hysterical , even  --  but Adrien ter Brock 's daughter would n't do a thing like that . . . . I 'm going straight up to her room and ask her about it . " Corey shook his head , and his eyes were narrow . " I would n't do it , Margot . However the thing got here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do about it . Why do n't you just take it easy and ask her about it sort of offhand-like when you get a good chance ? " " You may be right . But I hereby serve notice , Corey Graham , that if Katrien did n't care enough about it to hold onto it , I 'm going to find that little old man and give it back to him myself . " " Sure you are ! And Mrs. Graham 's little boy Corey is going to tag right along . . . . How about that drink ? " 82 DESIGN IN DIAMONDSI gave an exasperated little sigh as I dropped the brooch into the pocket of my sport dress and led the way through the formal garden . My reason told me he was right , but every instinct rebelled against such apparently casual dismissal of the matter . " Oh , you 're just like every other man  --  mention a drink , and the universe stops turning until you get it ! " I snapped . His hand was on my elbow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little message that soothed my momentary irritation and made me flash him a smile as we opened the terrace door and went into the living room . There was a fire burning on the hearth , and a man stood before it with a glass in his hand , staring contemplatively into the flickering light . He glanced up , and I saw that he was tall and well built , but with a slight stoop in his broad shoulders . His face was lean and scholarly , with deep lines bracketing the thin , firmly set mouth . He smiled courteously . " You must be Miss Blair . Ellen Prather told me you were here . My name is Lewers . " I shook hands with him and introduced Corey . " I understand you 've just been in Yucatan . I 've always had a great desire to see Chichen Itza myself , though I must confess I do n't know the first thing about archaeology . " " You 'd find it most interesting . Chichen Itza is an old story to us archaeologists , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been visiting the site of some new discoveries about forty miles this side of Merida . If you are interested I 'll have to show you some of the treasures I brought back with me  --  of a considerably earlier date than any formerly unearthed . " " I 'd love to see them , " I responded . Sean and Anna came in just then , followed almost immediately by Fritz , and the conversationbecame general . It was almost eight o'clock when the door from the guest corredor opened and Dirck led Katrien into the room . Her eyes looked big and dark in her white face , and her hand clung to his as if for courage . Fritz sprang forward . DESIGN IN DIAMONDS 83 " Well , this is splendid ! " he exclaimed heartily . " I 'm delighted to see you , Miss ter Brock ! You 're looking much better . Sit down here , close to the fire , and let me bring you a little sherry . " " Thank you , " she whispered , and sank into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered and sipped the wine , and a faint stain of color crept into her cheeks . She had not , it appeared , met Dr. Lewers . Fritz introduced him , and he sat down beside her to chat for a few minutes , and I thought there was a hint of animation in her eyes and her voice as he told her about his excavations in Yucatan . But when I brought Corey to introducehim , the life seemed to die out of her face , and a queer cold hostility to take its place . She responded to my introduction with a chilly courtesy and turned back pointedly to Dr. Lewers . " Tell me some more , please , " she begged , and Corey and I exchanged glances and backed away . Dirck rose from his seat beside Katrien and joined us . " You 'll have to forgive Katrien , Miss Blair , " he said with an apologetic little smile . " She does n't mean to be rude , but it 's quite an undertakingfor her to come down at all tonight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And it 's frightfully hard for her to meet strangers , feeling as she does . " " Yes , I understand . One seems to be about all she can manage , " Corey said blandly , watching Katrien 's interested face gazing up at Dr. Lewers . Dirck coughed uncomfortably . " Well , Dr. Lewers is  --  erunassociatedwith anything she has known before . You 'll forgive me , Miss Blair , when I say that you suggest unpleasant and difficult things  --  things she wants to escape from . There 's nothing personal about it , I assure you . " I could n't resist the opportunity he offered . " Possibly hervisitor this afternoon suggested the unpleasant past too , " I said . He stared at me , frowning . " Visitor ? I do n't quite " I understood she had a caller  --  an elderly Jewish man whomshe had befriended . " 84 DESIGN IN DIAMONDS " Oh yes , of course ! Herr Grynsbach . For the moment it had slipped my mind . Did you see him , Miss Blair ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katrien tell you about his visit ? " " Katrien did n't see him . " Beside me Corey made an almost imperceptible movement , as if in instinctive warning . " I 'm sorry , " I said quietly . " I suppose she did n't feel like coming down . But I think he must have been disappointed . He seemed very anxious to see her . His wife died yesterday , so he told me . " " His wife ? " Dirck shook his head sympathetically . " Oh , that 's too bad ! The poor old chap adored her ; in fact , she was all he had left to live for . He wo n't survive her very long . " The words were natural enough , but my own interpretation of them sent a little chill quivering along my spine . Dirck went on curiously : " How did you happen to talk to him , Miss Blair ? " " I passed through the arbor in the garden , and he was sitting there waiting . Luz had just gone to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ; I think it would have meant a great deal to him " Now wait a minute ! " he broke in . " Do n't blame Katrien for that . He did n't want to see her enough to wait until she dressed . " I stared at him . " She actually went down ? " " No , I did . Katrien was taking a nap when Luz came and told her Grynsbach was here . She got up and dressed ; then she called me and asked me to go and bring him up to her room so they could have a quiet talk without being disturbed . But when I got there he 'd gone . " " Without leaving any word ? " I pressed incredulously . He nodded , and his shoulders went up in a slight shrug . " I even went out to the kitchen and queried all the servants , but apparently he did n't say a word to anybody . Did he act impatientwhen you talked to him  --  or pressed for time ? " DESIGN IN DIAMONDS 85 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was only one thing in the world he wanted to do  --  talk to Katrien and give her " In that instant of hesitation I was aware of a slight stiffening of Corey 's body . I went on smoothly , " Give her a last message from his wife . " " Did he tell you what it was ? " " Oh , appreciation  --  thanks for what she 'd done , I gathered . " I said it offhandedly , and Dirck nodded . " Too bad he did n't stay . Something must have turned up  --  he may have remembered something he had to do . Well , I fancy he 'll show up again . " Just at that moment dinner was announced . It was not what one would term an exhilarating social experience . The guests clung together in pairs , and I was very glad to have Corey chatteringamiably at my side . Ellen Prather tried her best to make the conversation general , and she was aided manfully by Fritz and , occasionally , by Dr. Lewers , but without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things did emerge from that awkward dinner-table conversation . The first was an unmistakable conviction that Dirck and Sean did not like each other and were ready to seize upon the slightest pretext for disagreement . The other , which I realized with a distinct sense of shock , was that Sean had a well-developed case of Anglophobiaand a profound admiration for German music and Kultur . The ugly aspects of Nazi Germany simply did not exist for him . The Siegfried idea was , apparently , his god , and he , Scan O'Shane , admittedly the greatest interpreter of the Siegfried role , its high priest . " This Nazi business is only a passing phase , " he stated in those resonant , assertive tones that permitted no argument . " A Germany that has produced the Siegfried legend and held it up before its youth for countless centuries as the national ideal of manhood will always be great . No progress is ever achieved exceptby struggle .

For a moment , looking across the table at Dirck 's narrowed eyes and grim mouth , I waited tensely for the explosion ; when it came , I thought , it would be an answer more potent , more conclusive , than mere words . But Ellen forestalled it with hasty tact . " It 's all a matter of opinion , is n't it ? If you 've all finished we 'll have coffee in the drawing room . " CHAPTER XIVWE LINGERED in the drawing room only a few minutes after dinner . Corey edged to my side under cover of the conversation and muttered , " Let 's get out of here , " and as soon as he had made his adieux to Ellen and Fritz we slipped out of the terrace door into the deserted garden . " Whew ! " he exploded . " I thought for a minute there that a second front was going to be opened up , with us in the middle of it . That O'Shane bird and others like him are a menace to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is that they do n't realize it . He 's probably perfectly sincere  --  he simply refuses to face reality . " We walked on for a moment in silence . Then by tacit consent we picked up , where we had dropped it , the subject that was in both our minds . " What 's your guess , Corey ? " I said . " What happened to Herr Grynsbach ? " " Gosh , Margot , I du n no , " he said uncomfortably , and in the starlight I could see that his round , ordinarily optimistic face had a worried scowl . " What could happen to him in broad dayDESIGNIN DIAMONDS 87light in a perfectly respectable garden , on such an innocent errand ? It do n't make sense , but just the same " I think , " I said , forcing myself to a matter-of-fact , sensible view of the whole thing , " that you and I are letting our imagina- tions run away with us . That murder night before last shook our morale . But we certainly have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old chap got tired of waiting for Katrien . It may have taken her an hour or two ; apparently she was asleep , and by the time she had made up her mind to see him and dressed and found Dirck " " Yeah , I hope so , " Corey said pessimistically . " You did n't happen to ask him where he was staying , did you ? " " No . I 've been wishing I had . But there must be some refugee center where he would have registered . " " I 'll look into it in the morning . It would n't do any harm any- way . I 'd like to slip the poor old duffer a few bucks myself  --  he could probably use ' em for the funeral expenses . " " You old softie ! " I accused him affectionately . He made a deprecatory gesture . " Oh , that 's just an excuse . I want to get a load off my mind , that 's all . " We walked on for a moment in silence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " About that brooch  --  you said he had it wrapped up in paper . Did he do it up again after he showed it to you ? " I tried to remember . " I do n't think so . He took it out of the paper and let me look at it . When I left him I patted his hands , trying to comfort him a little . I seem to remember that he had it in the palm of his hand with the fingers cupped around it . " " Have you got it here ? Let me look at it , " he said abruptly . I put my hand in my pocket and found the brooch . Corey lighted a match and bent over it , scrutinizing it carefully . " Nothing here , " he said disappointedly . " I was thinking it might have been damaged  --  give us a clue to what happened  --  but it fell in the soft grass , and there is n't a scratch on it . " The88 DESIGN IN DIAMONDSmatch went out , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back  --  looks like initials and a date and something in German script . Ca n't read it by this light ; probably nothing of interest to us , anyway . " He handed it back , and I dropped it again into my pocket . We strolled on to the outer gate , and I unlocked it with the big key which hung from a hook on the vinecoveredwall . Corey seemed loath to go . " Listen , old-timer , " he said awkwardly . " I promised the Maestro I 'd look out for you , and I 've got a sneaking suspicion I 'm not doing it . Why do n't you move over to the inn with me ? " " Do n't be absurd , Corey ! " I said with some asperity . " I 'm just where I want to be  --  in the best possible position to accomplishthe thing I came to Mexico to do . " " Yeah  --  in a hornets ' nest ! " " Well , do n't forget that you put in some of your classiest technique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's what it is . It strikes me as a bit inconsistent , after half a day , to try to get me out of it . " " Just the same , something tells me it just ai n't healthy around here , " he said ominously . In the dim light his eyes looked straight into mine . " How are your finger tips ? " I could n't restrain a rueful little giggle . " To be perfectly honest , they 're threatened with nothing short of St. Vitus ' dance . " " I thought so . Look here , Margot "  --  his voice took on a pleading note  --  " why do n't you just hand over the family jools and beat it ? There 's nothing the matter with that girl mentally . She 's just rotten spoiled . Of course she 's had a lousy time , but that 's no excuse for making you hold the baby " " Oh , run along , Corey ! " I said wearily . " I 'm just as anxious to settle this business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little time . I 'll have another talk with her tomorrow . " " I still do n't like it , " he said reluctantly . " Watch your step , will you ? I 'll be over in the morning just as soon as I 've got aDESIGN IN DIAMONDS 89line on Grynsbach . And lock your bedroom door tonight , do you hear ? " " Nobody 's going to invade my bedroom . It is n't as though I carried the Ter Broek diamonds in my handbag . I have n't got anything that could possibly do anybody any good , " I assured him , and said good night . But as the heavy gate closed on him its metallic clang seemed to echo in my ears with a hollow ring of finality . It seemed to me , for one dreadful instant of panic , that I was shutting out the world of sanity and reasonableness and security and shutting myself into a strange new region of menace . For a moment I stood listening to Corey 's retreating footsteps on the gravel road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its hook . And suddenly , somewhere close by , I heard the crunch of anotherfoot on gravel . For an instant my heart stood still . I tried to tell myself that it was Corey who had made that sound . But I knew better . I had heard Corey 's steps retreating until they could be heard no longer , and this footstep had been close at hand  --  here in the garden with me . I stood listening intently , one hand pressed hard to my pounding heart , but the sound did not come again . Whoever made it must inadvertently have stepped on the gravel path . Walking on the grassy verge , his feet would make no sound . I could n't even tell from which direction it had come . I reminded myself severely that there was nothing especially fearful about a footstep on the garden path . Any member of the household had just as good a right to be in the garden as I had . But my own reasonableness was unconvincing . There had been a stealthy quality about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-discipline could alter its effect on my mind . The path which I must take wandered through clumps of dense shrubbery . I stepped off the gravel onto the soft grass90 DESIGN IN DIAMONDSand started for the distant house , stealing silently along on tiptoe . The foliage seemed to press close on either side , and every shrub took on strange shapes and reached out menacing fingers to clutch at me as I passed . I was conscious now of a light wind which stirred the branches and made a soft rustling sound in the leaves . And suddenly a hitherto unsuspected sense warned me of another presence near me ; unseen , unheard , but creeping surreptitiously along on a course parallel to my own , measuring its movements by mine . heavy weight . I forced myself to walk steadily on , looking neither to right nor left , trying not to listen to the whisper of the trees and soft rustlings that might indicate the passing of a human body . I slipped past a low-hanging cedar , and a branch that seemed almost animate reached out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that rose involuntarily to my lips and went on , more swiftly now . I wanted to run , but I knew that , once I gave way to flight , blind , frantic panic would rob me of whatevercontrol I still retained . The path straightened , and there were riotous , untended flower beds on either side . Far ahead the black cypresses stood up against the sky , like the somber portal of some gigantic mausoleum , and between them the starlight showed faintly the narrow , twisting ribbon of the footpath . I was conscious of my breath coming shallowly , unevenly . Beyond those funereal cypresses , I knew , was the flowering arbor , deeply shadowed now , where the little Jewish refugee had sat that afternoon ; for some reason a new terror seemed to focus there . But I did not know any other route to the house , and in my present state it was far better to face the known terrors ahead than to explore the unknown . And then without any warning there was a sound on the pathDESIGN IN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my swiftly indrawn breath pounding furiously at my ribs . There was a shape there , black and formless and horrible  --  something grotesque and top heavy that seemed to loom above me , like the faceless horror of some morbid tale . It made a strange low mooing sound and swooped suddenly toward me . I did not know that I had screamed , but I heard a thin thread of sound that must have come from my own lips quavering shrilly through the dark garden . Then I was running , my feet pounding in mad accompaniment to the frantic racing of my heart , up the path toward that faint light that showed the portal between the cypresses . I dashed through and saw beyond the dark , flower-laden mass of the arbor . Behind me I heard the Thing following close . Then something caught my flying feet just above the ankles , and I felt myself falling violently , terrifyingly . CHAPTER XVI THINK , though I have never been sure , that I may have lost consciousness for a moment . Certainly the lump on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I discovered later when I made my own inspection of the damage in my room , was enough to lend support to that theory . But whether I actually lost consciousnessor not , the shock of my fall stunned me so that for the moment I did n't know  --  or care  --  what was going on about me . It even , temporarily , drove away my fear . I became aware that there were hands fumbling over my body , moving my limbs into what might have appeared to be more comfortable positions , smoothing my skirt with a sort of clumsy solicitude . My body felt racked from stem to stern. 92 DESIGN IN DIAMONDS " Oh , go away and leave me alone ! " I moaned without openingmy eyes . " Are you hurt ? " That voice sounded a long way off , but the silly question infuriated me . " Hurt  --  no ! I 'm just lying here because I got tired ! " I 'm not sure whether I even said the words , but I thought I did . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me one split second of exquisite satisfaction I lay suffering comfortably . Then , like the impact of a lightning flash on closed eyelids , full consciousness returned , and with it the memory of terror and of the Thing that was responsible for my plight . My eyes flew open , and I looked straight up into the eyes of the man who was squatting beside me . It was Sean O'Shane . In the uncertain light his eyes had a cold glitter , and he was looking at me with a clinical , impersonal scrutiny . " What in the world happened to you ? " Not that he cared in the least , his tone indicated  --  but merely as a matter of curiosity . " I fell down , " I snapped , and struggled to a sitting position . " Help me up , please . " He gave me a hand , and it had a soft , slightly moist feeling . Definitely not a hand one would touch from choice . I dropped it hastily . " Thank you . I 'll be quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my feet , and I put out a hand to one of the uprightsupports of the arbor and anchored myself to it . Then I added , with some nebulous intent of irony , " Thank you for coming to my succor . " " I was smoking on the terrace , " he explained , rather unnecessarily , I thought . " Heard you scream . I thought something must have frightened you , from the sound . " " Did you ? " I responded , and the subject died . " Better let me give you an arm back to the house , " he sugDESIGNIN DIAMONDS 93gested , with the first hint of actual solicitude he had shown . " You look a bit shaken up . " " Thank you , but I 'm quite all right . " Gradually my brain was getting its equilibrium again and I was beginning to think back , more or less lucidly , over those increasingly terrifying moments since I had left Corey at the gate . What had happened , I was convinced , had all been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychology . I was beginning to think I had been intended to hear that single stealthy footfall , those faint , almost indistinguishablesounds of a lurking , spying Someone close by . And then , when nerves were stretched to the breaking point , the sudden pounce of that grotesque apparition that would have been enough to send any woman in shrieking panic down the garden path , straight into the trap . For I had no doubt whateverthat a trap had been responsible for my fall . Suddenly the memory of those pawing hands returned  --  hands that I thought now had been searching . I thrust my own hand into my pocket . I had been certain , even before I did it , that the brooch would be gone . I was still , I fancy , not quite responsible for my actions , or I should not have said what I did . " Did you take something out of my pocket just now , Mr. O'Shane ? " " Take something ! " he roared . " Are you insinuating ? " Already I was cursing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not insinuating anything . I had something in my pocket , and it 's gone  --  that 's all . I thought you might have " " You thought I might have stolen it ! " " Not at all , " I said with belated tact . " It might have rolled out  --  you might have seen it and picked it up without think-ing " " That 's not what you said ! You accused me of stealing ! " The94 DESIGN IN DIAMONDSworld-famous tenor voice was shrill and quavering with rage . Sean O'Shane was undoubtedly working himself up into a toweringtantrum . " I 'll teach you that nobody can accuse Sean O'Shane of stealing ! I have powerful friends ! I 'll " " Oh , stop it this minute ! " My frayed nerves gave way . " I have n't accused you of anything . I asked you a simple question  --  as one straightforward person to another . I certainly did n't expect you to fly into a tizzy over it ! Let 's drop the whole thing . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My honor has been assailed ! I demand satisfaction " " What do you want me to do  --  fight a duel with you ? " I snapped . That seemed to give him pause , if only for a moment . Then he returned to his grievance with new vigor . " You need n't think you 're going to make a farce out of this ! I shall be searched  --  I demand that I be searched ! And then  --  you will apologize to me ! " I had a sudden hysterical impulse to laugh . " Oh , is that what you want  --  an apology ! Well , you do n't have to make a song and dance about it . I apologize ! " " You 're trying to make me ridiculous ! " he shrilled . " You 're treating the whole thing as if it did n't make any difference ! This is a matter of honor with me . I should have known better than to come running to the assistance of an unknown woman . I should have remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you . But you ca n't blackmail me ! You ca n't ruin my career " I sobered suddenly . I do n't very often become coldly , murderouslyangry , but when I do people generally listen to me . " Will you kindly stop gibbering , Mr. O'Shane , and let metell you a few things ? " I said . " Your career is of no interest tome . Neither is your honor  --  which apparently requires suchprotestations of defense . I have offered to drop this matter , butDESIGN IN DIAMONDS 95you do n't wish to do so . I 've apologized , but apparently that is not sufficient either . I can only assume from your hysterical babblings that you still insist on being searched . Well , that 's perfectly all right with me . If you will kindly accompany me to the house we 'll take care of it . " His jaw had dropped , and if I had not been so furiously angry I should have been amused at the play of astonishment and consternation in his face . But it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how he had looked . At the moment I was far from amusement . " Come along ! " I snapped , and stalked off along the path , and Sean O'Shane followed me like a whipped puppy . Without another word we traversed the formal garden , mounted the terrace steps , and entered the living room . Dr. Lewers , Anna Gregor , Ellen and Fritz Prather were all there , reading by the open fire . Looking back on that moment , I still feel a profound astonishment that I carried it through . But my anger held . " Fritz , " I said calmly , " I just lost a trinket out by the arbor  --  an old-fashioned gold brooch . Mr. O'Shane seems to have jumped to the conclusion that I think he has stolen it . In spite of anything I can say , he demands that he be searched . I think it would clear the air if you would oblige . " He laid down his pipe and got up with a comical look of consternation . " Good lord ! I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But if he insists . . . I understood you correctly , did n't I , Mr. O'Shane ? " I deferred to him with sweet courtesy . He threw back his shoulders in outraged dignity . " You certainlydid ! Fritz , I demand that you search my person thoroughly  --  andthen that this woman apologize in the presence of all of vou . " " What  --  again ? " I murmured witheringly . And then without any warning my sense of humor went into action and a giggle96 DESIGN IN DIAMONDSburst explosively from my lips . The sound seemed to sting the man 's temper to new violent activity . " You see ? " he sputtered . " She 's making me ridiculous ! She ca n't get away with this ! " Fritz hooked his arm in Sean 's . " Oh , come along , Sean , " he said pacifically . " You 're making a mountain out of a molehill . Nobody thinks you stole anything . We 'll quickly prove it . " After the door closed on them there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cigarette from the table and lighted it . My hand , I noticed with detached interest , was still shaking a bit , and I was grateful for the stimulating bite of the smoke in my nostrils . I felt Ellen Prather 's shrewd green eyes watching me curiously . It was only a minute or two before the door opened again , and the two men came back . " I do n't need to tell you I drew a blank , " Fritz said heartily . " It was all just a misunderstanding , naturally  --  was n't it , Margot ? " " Not on my part . I knew perfectly well you would n't find anything . " The words might have had an equivocal sound , but I did n't care . " You may consider that an apology , if you care to . I 'm going to bed . Good night , everybody . " The tall cedars laid a thick mantle of shadow over the patio that lay between the service quarters and the guest wing , and in the swimming pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and impenetrable . I skirted the stone parapet of the pool and dragged my aching body up the circular staircase . There was a light in Katrien 's room  --  a narrow thread of light showed in the crack under the loosely fitting door  --  but the other rooms in the wing were dark . As I opened my own door across the little landing and fumbled for the electric switch I caught the low murmur of conversation  --  Katrien 's voice and Dirck 's deeper masculine one . I turned on the light , closed the door , and dropped down into a big chair . I felt exhausted . It had been a full day , and the unaccustomedDESIGN IN , DIAMONDS 97altitude would have tired me in any case . The unnerving experienceI had undergone , coupled with the shock of my fall , had taken what little reserve I had , and for the moment I felt incapable of moving another muscle  --  even to prepare for bed . My brain was churning over all that had happened , dizzily , without bringing any of the incidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . Then before I could summon the will to answer the handle turned and Ellen Prather walked in . She closed the door , drew up a chair , and plopped herself down into it decisively . " Margot Blair , " she demanded , " what goes on here ? " " Goes on ? " I repeated feebly . " Why , really , Ellen " " Do n't try to pretend you do n't know what I 'm talking about ! I 've been watching you all evening . You and that young man of yours are up to something . And now this outrageous business with Sean . You 've undoubtedly got a good reason for it , but I 'd like to know what it is . After all , Pm the one who 's got to keep peace in the family  --  on the surface , at any rate . " " It was outrageous , was n't it ? " I was playing for time , consideringwhat I should tell her and how much . I liked Ellen Prather , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not intend to tell her the whole story . Not , at any rate , until I knew her better . " Of course I did n't accuse him of stealing anything . He practically put the words into my mouth . " She nodded . " I thought as much . But he 's fit to be tied . He was difficult enough to handle before this . " " Want me to leave ? " " Mercy , no ! If the same roof wo n't harbor you both , he 'll be the one to leave . He 's the one who took offense . " She sighed heavily . " To tell you the truth , I should n't mind a bit if he did . It 's something of a strain to keep things pleasant  --  Sean and Anna are both so temperamental . . . . But go ahead and98 DESIGN IN DIAMONDStell me what happened out in the garden tonight . You were shaking from head to foot when you came in , and I do n't think it was all anger , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirt on your dress , and a bump on your head . What did he do  --  attack you ? " In spite of myself I had to smile . " Oh , good grief , no ! I fell down  --  and Sean picked me up . " " And you accused him of picking your pocket ! " She shook her head . " That is n't good enough . Tell me the rest . " I smiled ruefully . " Well , it sounds silly , but I suppose I may as well confess . I got in a panic  --  like a child afraid of the dark . I went to the gate with Corey , and as I was walking back I thought I heard someone in the bushes following me . So I started to run  --  and tripped over something . That 's all there was to it . " She was eying me speculatively . " You do n't think it was imagination at all . It was Sean  --  and you have some reason to think he wanted the thing you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't expected her to leap to conclusions quite so briskly . " Really , Ellen , " I protested , " I have n't any reason to suspect Sean of anything . It was just that he arrived on the scene so promptly , and there was no one else near  --  at least I did n't see anybody " But what was the thing he stole ? And why did he want it ? " I threw up my hands . " He did n't steal it ! Or if he did Oh , Ellen , do n't you see how ridiculous the whole thing is ? I have n't one scrid of evidence that he had anything to do with it . The darn thing probably flew out of my pocket when I took my header into the bushes . " She shrugged , and I knew that she was entirely unsatisfied by my explanation . " Maybe . We 'll take a good look in the morning . . . . So you 're not going to tell me any more about it ? " DESIGN IN DIAMONDS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's nothing more to tell . Oh , there was something else  --  something I meant to ask you about . Did any of the maids mention the caller this after- noon ? " " Caller ? No . " " I happened to run across him in the garden when I was starting for my walk . An elderly man  --  Jewish . He came to call on Miss ter Broek  --  evidently she 'd helped him somewhere on her travels . But Dr. van Ryper told me this evening that she did n't see him . When she came down he had gone . I thought maybe he 'd told one of the maids he could n't wait any longer . " She shook her head , frowning a bit . " I had n't heard about it , but I 'll inquire . It seems a bit odd  --  a Jewish refugee . Do you know which maid admitted him ? " " Luz . I saw her on her way up to Miss ter Broek 's room . " She shrugged and rose . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Living inside a locked fence has its advan- tages . I 'll tell you all about it in the morning if you 're interested . " Her eyebrows went up meaningly as she added , " Any time you want to do the same , let me know . . . . Good night . " CHAPTER XVII DID NOT SLEEP VERY WELL , in spite of the fact that I was bonetired . My brain was wide awake , and my nerves felt as though they had pierced my skin and were waving in the atmosphere , jangling like an aeolian harp in a light breeze . Faces and figuresseemed to whirl in dizzy succession before my closed eyes : a sagging , elderly face with a straggly beard and tired old eyes that looked up into mine hopelessly ; a huddled form wrapped in100 DESIGN IN DIAMONDSblankets and topped by a sombrero , squatting on a doorstep ; a girl 's strained face , with clouded eyes and a voice that whispereddrearily , " I do n't remember . " It must have been hours before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed only a few minutes I started awake again . But the sun was up , streaming into my eastern windows with the thin , brilliant light of early morning . I looked at my watch . It was half-past six . Below , I heard the sound of a broom briskly plied and , glancing down into the patio that surrounded the swimming pool , I saw Cristina , one of the maids , busily engaged in sweeping the flagged pavement . The happenings of the previous evening were crowding my mind ; questions that must be answered were teasing my brain . I dressed hastily and slipped down the circular staircase , past the swimming pool that lay green and clouded in the shade of the tall cedar , and took the path that led through the oleander thicket to intersect the path from the gate . Everything had a different look in the clear morning light . It seemed incredible now that the whimsically sculptured evergreensand box trees could have assumed the grotesque , terrifyingshapes of last night  --  that the gravel path winding through the unkempt garden should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall black cypresses , with the flaming mass of the arbor beyond , seemed now only an effective frame for an exotic picture , and I paused for an instant , admiring it as an artistic composition . Then I remembered the purpose of my early-morning visit and put aside my aesthetic appreciation in favor of the practical . From where I stood I could see the strip of path leading through the cypress portal straight to the rustic arbor . In spite of the panic which had spurred my feet to my headlong fall , my memory of the episode was perfectly clear . It was there between the two cypresses that I , had tripped , and the momentum of my flight had thrown me forward so that my head had struck one ofDESIGN IN DIAMONDS 101the upright posts supporting the arbor twelve or fifteen feet beyond . I scanned the path . It was perfectly flat , without the slightest obstruction upon which I might have stubbed my toe . But I had felt practically certain of that in advance . For I knew I had not stubbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had caught me above the ankles . I dropped to my knees on the soft grassy border and pushed aside the low-hanging branches of the cypress on the right hand . I had a fairly good idea what I was looking for , but I did n't find it . Then I backed out , crossed the path , and went down on my knees again , crawling into the cool fragrant shade under the branches of the left-hand tree . And suddenly my breath caught sharply , for I knew that someone had been there before me . In the thin green moss that carpeted that perpetually shadowed spot there were footprints  --  traces , rather , that feet had crushed the soft moss that was almost like a faint green bloom , so fragile that the slightest touch destroyed it . And then I saw that there was a little horizontal line cut in the bark of the tree , about ten inches from the ground . For a moment I crouched there staring at it . This was exactly the sort of evidence I had been looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significance of the thing appalledme . Until this moment I had clung with optimistic obstinacyto the hope that I might have been mistaken . Now I knew there was no possibility of mistake . I felt shaken to the soul as I backed out into the sunlight and got to my feet . Then I spun about with a sharp intake of breath as someone spoke close at hand . " What the devil are you doing ? " Anna Gregor was sitting under the arbor . She was wearing a slack suit of the color known as " shocking pink "  --  which probablyaccounted for the fact that I had not noticed her when I102 DESIGN IN DIAMONDShad looked at the arbor from a distance . She had a sketch pad in her lap . I recovered my poise as well as I could under the circumstances , embarrassingly conscious that I must have made a ridiculous figure as I emerged , stern first , from under the tree . " I was looking for that pin I lost last night , " I said with dignity . She sniffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hide-and-go-seek . Or did you think he 'd buried it under the tree like a dog ? " There was unmistakable hostility in her voice and manner , but I ignored it and gave her what I hoped was a sweet smile . " Sean ? Oh , no indeed . As a matter of fact , I fell down  --  with considerable force . The thing might have rolled almost any-where . " " It seems to me , " she said acidly , " that you 'd be more likely to find it somewhere near where you fell down . It just happens that Sean told me that he found you right here under the arbor . " There was n't any very good answer to that , so I took refuge in sarcasm . " Your suggestion has merit , Miss Gregor . I should never have thought of it myself . I will take a look around the arbor  --  if I do n't disturb you . " " Oh , I was just going , " she said disagreeably , and departed . After she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lawn surrounding it , but I did not find the brooch . I was not exactly disappointed , for I had known , with a knowledge that was very close to certainty , that it was not there . And presently I went back to the house and crossed the patio to the service quarters . There was , I knew , a telephone there , and none of the servants , so Ellen had told me , spoke English . Cristina and Luz were there , making preparation for breakfast . " HaJ telefono , por favor ? " I inquired in my own sketchyDESIGN IN DIAMONDS 103brand of Spanish , and Cristina ushered me into a small pantry where the instrument stood on the shelf . I dialed the inn and asked for Corey , and after an interminable wait I heard his voice , slightly rough with sleep . " Good lord , Margot , have you killed somebody ? " " Not yet . But that does n't mean I wo n't  --  and that right soon ! Corey , I 've got to talk to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " How soon can you get over here ? " Ile sighed loudly . " How about ten o'clock ? " " How about fifteen minutes from now ? " I countered sternly . " You 're not a woman , " he said . " You 're a high-frequency vibrating machine . Make it half an hour . You know me  --  before I 've had my coffee " " Fifteen minutes , " I repeated . " And do n't wait for coffee . I 'll provide that . " CHAPTER XVIIFOR ALL HIS COMPLAINING , Corey was wide awake and thoroughlyalert when he joined me across the breakfast table exactlythirteen minutes later . A bit of discreet bribery had inducedCristina to bring two breakfast trays to the scrap of open roof which made a balcony outside my french windows . Corey watched with some impatience as she puttered about , arranging the dishes to her satisfaction , and when she had finally gone off down the staircase he jerked his chair closer to mine . " Well , spout , old faithful . What 's happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said solemnly , " I should be a dead woman this morning . " 104 DESIGN IN DIAMONDS " Hunh ? " he gasped incredulously . " Whaddayuh mean ? " I told him then exactly what had happened after I left him at the gate the evening before . I even confessed to my own panic flight and the tactless blundering which had resulted in the seriocomic scene with Mr. O'Shane . He chuckled over that , but his amusement was perfunctory and he was sober as he returned again to the main facts of my story . " But , my lord , Margot , this is serious ! " " So was the attack on Anselmo and the murder of Piet Maartens . " " But here  --  in this house " Why not ? Katrien 's here , is n't she ? And so am I  --  with the Ter Broek fortune in my keeping . What more natural place for the next chapter in this little melodrama ? " His eyes were intent ; I could almost see the workings of that keen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gate , laid a trap for you , and when you 'd got rid of me chased you into it . " " Yes . " I smiled mirthlessly . " And I appreciate the omission of the obvious remark  --  that I was undoubtedly scared by my own shadow . " " Any time , " he said weightily , " that I suspect you 've bust out at the seams that way I wo n't tell you about it  --  I 'll go get me a new boss . . . . And the Shadow was after that brooch you had in your pocket ? " " That 's my profound conviction . He not only was after it  --  he got it . " " But why ? What on earth would it do for him ? " I shook my head soberly . " I ca n't imagine  --  unless  --  well , it 's the only concrete bit of evidence that Herr Grynsbach was in the garden yesterday . " " You saw him , and the maid saw him , " he pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't see him in the part of the garden where we picked up the brooch . Do n't ask me the sigDESIGNIN DIAMONDS 105nificance of that observation because I do n't know . But I have a dreadful suspicion that it means something . And when I say dreadful , I mean just that . " He nodded . " Yeah . Me too . These guys mean business , and if anybody steps in their way it 's just too bad . . . . Feel pretty sure it was O'Shane , do n't you  --  last night ? " " I do n't know ! " I groaned . " All I 'm sure about is that somebody was pawing me over , and when I finally opened my eyes he was bending over me . And he does n't strike me as the sort of man to be actuated by good-Samaritan impulses . " " And he 's an Anglophobe and thinks Hitler is actually Siegfriedin a damn good disguise . " He lighted a cigarette and drew on it thoughtfully . " Van Ryper is the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seem to see the killer in him , though , can you ? " " No , but I suppose we could both be wrong . But there 's one thing I 'm sure about  --  Van Ryper 's in love with Katrien . There are little signs that women notice  --  and that no man could fake , I 'm certain . He 's conscious of her every minute ; even when he was talking with me across the room he was listening for her voice ; whenever he was near her he wanted to touch her . I 'd stake my professional reputation that he 's crazy about her . " Corey grinned . " I would n't argue that with you . You ought to know the symptoms , gorgeous . . . . But how do he and O'Shane get along ? Palsy-walsy ? " " Anything but . You heard them last night at the dinner table . They were ready to pick a fight over the time of day . " " Might be doing it for effect . " " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . But your term palsy-walsy ' could very well be applied to Anna Gregor and O'Shane , and Anna was sitting in the arbor this morning about half-past six when I went out to look for signs of foul play . " He whistled softly . " Doing what ? " I smiled acidly . " Doing sentry-go , I suspect . She was wear-106 DESIGN IN DIAMONDSing , by an astonishing coincidence , the exact color to make her practically invisible under the bougainvillaea vine ; she sat extremely quiet until I practically stumbled over her . She had a sketchbook on her lap , but there certainly was nothing sketchableto be seen from where she was sitting  --  nothing but the inside of the arbor . " " But what the hell did she think she was going to see ? " " Me  --  hunting for evidence that I 'd actually been tripped up by a wire strung between the cypresses . Which she did . UnlessI 'm very much mistaken , they know now that I 'm aware that dirty work is going on inside Casa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they wo n't work so hard to create the illusion of accident . They know I 'll be on my guard  --  and also that they 'll have to work fast . A satisfactory development , on the whole , from our point of view . " " Maybe . " He said it pessimistically . " Me  --  I do n't like the sound of it . If we knew what to look out for we could look out for it , but " " And if we knew all the answers we could go home , " I retorted . He jerked his chair closer to mine . " Look here , indomitable , Felix would flay me alive and fling my hide to the coyotes if anythinghappened to you . For that matter , I 'd sort of regret it myself . Come on over to the inn like a good girl , where I can keep an eye on you . We 'll come over every day and check up on Katrien , and just as soon as she 's able to talk business youcan 99I shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

" You may have something there , gal ! " he muttered . " That 's just it . Maybe I have , but I do n't know  --  and I do n't know how to find out . This tale of a sudden nervous collapsehas never sounded very convincing to me , perhaps because I talked with Katrien on the telephone the very day it is supposedto have happened . She did n't sound to me like a girl on the verge of a nervous breakdown . " " In that case , Van Ryper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's too crazy about her to be a party to anything like that . " " That 's the very reason he might . Might have the effect of a love potion . She suddenly decided she wanted to marry him , did n't she ? " " I do n't think he 's the kind of man who would care for a drug-induced love affair , " I insisted . " But of course this is all pure hypothesis . We are merely making a wild guess about the drugs . . . . Corey , I 'm not willing to carry the responsibility for this affair very much longer . Anselmo ought to be here . " " She 's going to marry the other guy , " he pointed out . " I 'm not so sure about that . She was in full command of her faculties when she telephoned me , and she had no intention then of marrying anybody but Anselmo . " " I wonder how much longer he 'll have to stay in the hospital , " he mused . I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I 'm worried I always feel the need to move about , and now my mind was puzzling over the complicated affair , trying to formulatea course of action . Below , in the patio , the swimming pool was like a block of jade now , cloudy green , with a shifting iridescentpattern that swirled lazily under the morning sun . I remember thinking , with the idle fringe of my consciousness , 108 DESIGN IN DIAMONDSthat the tiny twigs that dropped from the overhanging cedar must exude a resinous substance that was responsible for that shifting green film . I came to an abrupt decision . " I think we 'd better telephone him . If they wo n't let him talk on the phone I 'll tell Miss Garrett the story  --  as much of it as is necessary . At least she can tell me how soon he can travel , and she can take it up with him . " " Yeah  --  hospitals are always so co-operative about handing on bad news to their patients ! " he observed , and went on with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Colin . And what do you think ? Somebody just telephoned from Mexicoto let us know that your sweetheart has changed her mind . She 's going to marry the other man  --  the little hussy ! And here 's a couple of bromides . Let 's see if we ca n't get a nice long nap ! " " What would he want to sleep for ? " I demanded . " And after all , he is n't at the point of death . If I do know anything about men in love , he certainly would n't appreciate being protected from the knowledge of what 's going on . If he can get on a plane " My breath caught suddenly in my throat with a little strangled gasp . Corey 's head jerked about . " What 's the ? Oh , you 're thinking about war priorities . He 's got diplomatic connections , remember . I guess there won'tbe any I shook my head sharply . I was looking down on that green pool below  --  on the oily , scummy surface that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horror . " Corey , " I breathed , " come here . . . . Look down there at the pool  --  about six feet from the deep end . Watch  --  when the sun goes under that next cloud . " His face crinkled in a curious frown . " I do n't get you . " " Never mind  --  just watch . When the sunlight dulls you can see the bottom . " DESIGN IN DIAMONDS 109For a long moment we stood shoulder to shoulder , leaning on the parapet , staring down into the pool . I remember thinking , like a person quite outside my own shaken , horror-stricken self , that only from such a height as this could one see the thing that lay there at the bottom of the pool , as a low-flying plane can sight wreckage at sea which is invisible from the surface . I felt Corey 's hand on my elbow . His fingers tightened until they seemed to bite into my flesh . " Well , I guess we 've got the answer to what happened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wonderful man in emergencies . He seems to have an inspired grasp of what must be done and the neatest and most expeditious way to accomplish it . And in all honesty I must admit that when I find myself in a situation like that one I realize that I 'm only a poor weak woman after all , and I am profoundly grateful to have him at my elbow , taking charge of affairs in his own inimitable way . " You 'd better go back to your room and stay there until you hear from me , Margot , " he said . " Let 's just get together on one thing before I go . What 's our line ? How much do we know  --  or suspect ? " " Nothing , " I said positively . " We saw a body in the pool . Is n't that as far as we need to go ? " " Yeah , " he said thoughtfully . " I do n't see why not . The body will prove , unless we 're very much mistaken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call on Katrien yesterday afternoon . They may ask you to identify him  --  probably will . . . . SupposeO'Shane brings up the matter of the little gold brooch ? " no DESIGN IN DIAMONDS " I do n't think he will . He certainly wo n't , if he had anything to do with the man 's death . If anybody does mention it "  --  I hesitated , considering the thing from various angles  --  " well , I do n't have to admit that I know it has anything to do with the case . I 'm very sure I did n't tell anybody but you that Herr Grynsbach showed it to me . " He nodded contemplatively . " Uh-huh . I guess you 're right . Whoever chased you last night and got the thing away from you certainly would n't mention it unless he had to . . . . But suppose somebody does bring it up ? Everybody in the house must know by this time that you had a brooch in your pocket and that you fell down and lost it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up , but they might . If anybody mentions it  --  well , you could tell ' em you found it in the garden and show ' em where , could n't you ? " " Finders , keepers ? Want to make me a social outcast ? " I retorted . " When one finds a piece of jewelry in the garden of a private house , the normal procedure is to display it and see if one can find the owner . How do you expect me to explain that I simply put it in my own pocket and referred to it as my own , when it became necessary to refer to it at all ? " He chuckled humorlessly . " It does n't sound like such a good idea when you put it that way . . . . How about the Prathers ? Sure you do n't want to take them into your confidence ? " " I do n't want to confide in anybody unless I have to . With the exception , that is , of Anselmo . Are you convinced now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . Want me to do it , or would you rather talk to him yourself ? " " I 'd better  --  but not from here . Ca n't we go over to the inn and put in the call ? Right now , before we tell anybody about the body in the pool ? " He thought it over judicially . " Might could , I suppose . We could take a little walk after breakfast and then come backDESIGN IN DIAMONDS 111to the balcony here to do some work  --  I 've already been establishedas your assistant , though what I 'm supposed to assist you with is one of the profound mysteries of life . Write your speeches for the women 's clubs , I suppose . . . . And while we 're writing a speech we could stroll to the rail and discover the body all over again . " " Something like that , " I snapped a bit impatiently . " Let 's go . If we get him at once he could probably catch today 's plane . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we got a speedy connection with the States . And after a short delay at the switchboard of Mercy Hospital we heard a cool feminine voice speaking . " This is Miss Garrett , superintendent of nurses . " " This is Miss Blair , Anselmo Colin 's friend , " I said . " I am speaking from Mexico City on a rather urgent matter . Would it be possible for me to be connected with Senor Colin himself ? " " He 's not here , unfortunately  --  or perhaps fortunately , if you want to get in touch with him . I believe he is on his way to Mexico right now . " " On his way ! " I repeated . " He has left the hospital ? He is well ? " " Quite able to travel . His wrist will be in a cast for several weeks  --  aside from that he is quite well . " " Have you any idea how soon he will get here ? " I asked . " He had a reservation on yesterday 's plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrive in Mexico City sometime today . " I thanked her for her more than professional kindness and hung up . " Well , the Lord takes care of His own , " Corey observed . " But we 'd better do our part in the caretaking . My intuitive soul tells me Anselmo will make tracks for Cuernavaca the minute he lands , and once the old lady gets his ear it 's ten to one112 DESIGN IN DIAMONDShe 'll never come here looking for Katrien . We 'd better be at the airport when that plane lands . " " I see your point , " I agreed . " Let 's find out about plane schedules . " We called the airport and learned that the plane from the States was due at eleven fifty-five . Then we hurried back to Casa del Seto and climbed to the balcony over the pool . Already the sun was riding high in the heavens , and the pool lay in full light , without a ripple on its glassy surface . We leaned on the parapet and looked down , trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our eyes . I looked at Corey apprehensively . " I ca n't see anything , can you ? " He shook his head . " It would take a good pair of eyes to find a body at the bottom of that pool in this light . Maybe we were n't so smart . . . . I suppose I could have a sudden yearningfor a cold plunge and get one of the boys to lend me a pair of trunks . I 'd guarantee to find him . But  --  well , I do n't exactly hanker for the idea . Besides , it sounds a bit thin , does n't it ? " " Definitely . Also repulsive . " My eyes scanned the sky a bit desperately . There was a tiny puffball of cloud floating overhead . " We 'd better stick to our original story  --  at least it had the advantage of being the truth at the time . We can pin it on that bit of cloud over there . It might have cast a momentary shadow ; nobody can prove it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said pessimistically . " We 'll soon find out  --  when the police get here . Well , here goes . Keep your fingers crossed . " He ran down the stairs , crossed the patio to the main part of the house , and went in . And after a moment or two he reappearedwith Fritz Prather and Dr. Lewers , and they came swiftly across the patio to the pool . Fritz shouted something in Spanish , and Juan , the gardener , came running from the servants ' quarters . Corey looked up to the balcony and saw meDESIGN IN DIAMONDS 113standing where he had left me , held by a compulsion stronger than my own will . " Go into your room , Margot , " he called , and the new curt authority in his voice seemed to break the frozen spell that held me , and I obeyed . Through the open windows I could hear sounds of activity below : the low voices of the men , the splashing of water , the tramp of feet on the flagged pavement . Then for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to me that I could not bear that empty , aching stillness another minute , there was a light tap on my door , and Corey came in . There was a white , sick look about his mouth . He closed the door quietly . " Well , we found him , and it was just as we thought . They 'll want you to identify him as the man you saw in the garden . I have n't the slightest doubt , from your description , that it 's the same one . " Tears were stinging my eyeballs . " The poor little old man ! He 'd been through so much  --  and now to end like that . " I turned away from him and dropped my head in my clenched hands . Corey 's fingers gripped my shoulder in what was for him an unprecedented gesture of sympathy . " Do n't take it too hard , old-timer , " he said huskily . " Dying is n't the worst thing that can happen , you know . He had n't much left to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did n't know what hit him . " I gulped down the painful lump in my throat and swung about to stare at him . " Hit him ? " I repeated . " Did n't he drown ? " Corey 's voice was low . " Something  --  or somebody  --  hit him on the head . He went into the pool when he was unconscious  --  at least that 's the way I figure it out , and both Prather and Lewers agree with me . He must have been breathing , or the body would have floated . We 'll have to get confirmation of that , of course , when the police doctor gets here . " 114 DESIGN IN DIAMONDSJust then there was another tap on the door and Corey opened it . Cristina stood there . The policia , so she said , had arrived and desired the presence of the senorita and the senor in the drawing room at once , por favor . CHAPTER XIXIT WAS A SOBER COMPANY that we found assembled in the big drawing room . Only Dirck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in a moment later . Katrien 's eyes looked big and dark and horror-filled , and when Dirck had seated her with tender solicitude in a big chair slightly apart from the rest of us , she covered her eyes with her handkerchief . A dark-faced inspector of police was there , talking with Fritz Prather . He was a brisk , alert man in well-tailored civilian clothes , and I registered a mental note that he would be a good man to know in case the affair on which we were engaged should reach the point where we needed police help . Fritz introduced him as Police Inspector Ochoa , and he spoke to us in impeccable English . I liked the competent , courteous way in which he elicited our testimony and his practicedelimination of unnecessary red tape . To tell the truth , I had mentally prepared myself for something quite different , and it was a distinct relief to find the investigation of Herr Grynsbach 's death in the hands of a professionally competent man . And let me say right here that my opinion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposition of the Grynsbach case . Presented with the same evidence , and hearingonly the cautious testimony of witnesses who , for one reason or another , were linked in a common determination that no hintDESIGN IN DIAMONDS 115of anything sinister should reach him , any police official in the States would have done the same . " My supposition , from what I have been told , is that the dead man was a certain Herr Grynsbach , a Jewish refugee from Germany , who called here yesterday afternoon to see Senorita ter Broek , " he said smoothly . He turned to Katrien . " I am correctin my understanding that you did not actually see him ? " Katrien shook her head , and her eyes looked piteous . " No , I did n't see him . I was asleep when he came and I had to dress . It took me quite a while , I 'm afraid . If I 'd hurried , if I 'd gone right down , perhaps he would n't  --  perhaps he would still " The words broke off in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crooked elbow on the arm of her chair . Her slim shoulders were shaking . Dirck 's arm went about her , and after a moment she controlled herself and sat up again with a pathetic attempt at dignity . " I 'm sorry , " she said . " I hope you will not concern yourself unduly about your connection with this unfortunate affair , " said the inspector suavely . " It is always so when tragedies occur . Somebody alwaysthinks , If I had not done thus and so  --  if circumstances had not transpired exactly as they did  --  this would not have happened . ' But these things can not be foreseen . . . . I regret to distress you further , senorita , but I 'm afraid I must ask you to identify the dead man  --  to establish without question that he is the man you knew as Herr Grynsbach . " She drew in her breath sharply . " Oh , I could n't ! " she whispered . " Ca n't I do that , sir ? " Dirck broke in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . I was with her when she befriended him and his wife in Buenos Aires . " The inspector looked relieved . " Certainly . It is merely necessary to establish the man 's identity beyond question . Will you come this way , please ? " 116 DESIGN IN DIAMONDSThey went out together , and the rest of us sat waiting in a sort of taut , uncomfortable silence . And presently they came back . Across the room Dirck 's eyes went straight to Katrien 's , and he nodded shortly . " It 's Grynsbach , " he said , and I saw Katrien bite her lips as if to steady them . The inspector turned to me . " And now , Senorita Blair , I must ask you to identify him as the man to whom you talked in the garden yesterday . " I nodded and followed him across the patio to a little room with a door that opened directly onto the flagged courtyard . It was a bare , scrupulously clean little room with a bed in it , and on the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white homespun counterpane . I noticed , with a sick , detachedfragment of my mind , that trickles of water were running down the wooden frame of the bed , and little pools lay on the cement floor . I was aware , vaguely , that Corey was beside me , his hand on my arm . The inspector drew back the white covering , and I saw Herr Grynsbach 's face . His eyes were mercifully closed , and someone had covered the side of his head with a bit of white linen attached by adhesive tape . I could only guess what that scrap of linen covered , but I was grateful that there was nothing gruesome about his appearance . I was only conscious of the look of weary peace on that sagging gray face and the heartbreakingpathos of the wet gray beard pointing upward , and under it the Adam 's apple in a wrinkled , pitifully scrawny neck . I closed my eyes against a burning rush of tears and nodded . " It is the man you saw in the garden yesterday ? " the inspectorsaid gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . I 'm certain . " " Where did you see him last ? " " He was sitting in the arbor  --  under the bougainvillaea . " " Had you ever seen him before , to your knowledge ? " DESIGN IN DIAMONDS 117 " No . I 'm sure I never had . " He covered that still , lead-colored face , and we went out again into the sunshine and walked slowly back across the patio . At the end of the swimming pool the inspector halted and stood for a moment , studying the surroundings . " Yes , it could have happened , " he muttered under his breath . " It could be easily explained , if he had known where Miss ter Broek 's room was . " I was staring at him uncomprehendingly . " If he had known But he did ! I told him . " Light seemed to break over his thin intelligent face . " You did ? He asked you ? " " Not exactly . He thought it a bit odd that the maid had left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the house , and I explained to him that there was an outside circular staircase leading up to Miss ter Broek 's room , so that he was actually in a more convenient spot than if he were in the house itself . . . . But I do n't understand . How would that explain ? " " The man had evidently fallen and suffered a blow on the head which knocked him unconscious . In that condition he then fell into the pool and drowned . Mr. Prather pointed out to me that a fall from the circular staircase would fulfill all the conditions . The only thing lacking was reasonable evidence that he might have been on the staircase . You have supplied that . . . . Those unguarded staircases twisting about a central axis are picturesque , but I have always thought them extremely danger-ous . " Corey and I exchanged guarded glances . This disposition of the case seemed almost too good to be true . Not that we wanted the murderer of Herr Grynsbach to go unpunished  --  far from it . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare . Herr Grynsbach , we felt sure , was only a minor character in this drama of life and death . Katrien and the Ter Brock118 DESIGN IN DIAMONDSfortune would never be safe until we had learned the whole truth . " Yes , " I said soberly . " It could have happened . . . . And there is another possibility  --  I suppose you have thought of it yourself . He was completely ruined  --  homeless  --  his wife had just died " The inspector 's eyes had a sudden gleam . " Of course ! It was not necessarily an accident . He might have gone straight up to that second-story roof , where there is a straight drop to the pool . He could not have hoped to survive a fall like that ; he may even have gauged his jump so that he would strike the pavement rather than the pool . " " I guess you 've got the answer , Inspector , " said Corey admiringly . The other man held out his hand to each of us in turn . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much relieved that it has turned out this way . Senor Prather and his good wife are old residents in Mexico  --  distinguished residents . I should have been very much distressed if it had been necessary to probe into their private lives  --  or those of their guests . " " Then your verdict , " Corey said , " will be  --  " " Accident or suicide  --  I 'm afraid we will never know which . Obviously Herr Grynsbach either jumped or fell from the staircaseor the roof , struck his head on the edge of the pool , fell in , and died by drowning . " CHAPTER XXIT WAS a long drive out to the airport , and it lacked only a few minutes of noon when Corey and I drove up to the entrance in our hired car . The announcer informed us that the planeDESIGN IN DIAMONDS 119was about to come in for a landing , and we hurried out to the field just as the big air liner rolled down the runway and taxied up in front of the administration building . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall dark-faced young man who was evidently in a great hurry . His right arm was in a black silk sling , but even aside from that we both recognized him instantly . I called to him as he came through the portal . " Senor Colin ! " He glanced up . Then he , too , recognized us and pushed his way through the little knot of waiting people , his left hand outstretched cordially to me . " Well , hello , Miss Blair ! And Mr. Corey  --  was n't that the name ? This is a surprise ! Am I to assume that you came here to meet me ? " " Who else ? " Corey in turn shook his hand . " The name is Corey Graham  --  but it 's still plain Corey to you , Anselmo . Glad to see you looking so fit . " " Oh , I 'm fine . There was n't much wrong except this wrist . How did you know I was coming on this plane ? " Corey chuckled . " You ca n't keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She insisted on calling you up this morning . " Anselmo gave me an astonished look . " Called me up ? In New York ? " " Yes . I tried to get you at the hospital . Miss Garrett told us you were already on your way to Mexico . " He stopped in his tracks . " Why did you telephone to me ? There 's nothing wrong ? Katrien 's all right ? " " Well , yes  --  and no . I 'll tell you all about it on the way  --  we 've got a car waiting . " When we were in the car headed for San Angel he turned to me impatiently . " Now tell me what this is all about . And whatIII1120 DESIGN IN DIAMONDSare we going to San Angel for ? I want to see Katrien  --  right away  --  and she is at my mother 's in Cuernavaca . " " No , she is n't , " I said , and plunged straightway into the story of all that had occurred since we left him in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying a word , but , watching him , I saw his mouth set in a thin determined line and his eyes grow sharp and narrow . When I had finished he sat for a long moment in silence , thinking over what I had told him . Then his head turned and he looked straight into my eyes . " You 've seen Katrien  --  talked with her . Do you honestly believe she wants to marry this Van Ryper chap ? Is it  --  what you call on the level ' ? " " I really do n't know what to say , Anselmo . She 's trying psychologically to escape from unhappiness , and you seem to be associated in her mind with Holland and all the memories that hurt . As she explained it to me , you only knew her when she was happy ; Dirck has shared the other experiences  --  the hard ones . It may be only a temporary state of mind , but no one can say . At the present moment I believe she wants to marry him and that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she 's going to see me . I 'm going to hear it from her own lips . She owes me that much . " His voice had a hard , gritty sound , and I glanced at him in surprise . There was an angry glitter in his black eyes , and his lips were set in a thin , hard line . And for the first time I wondered whether Katrien 's instincthad been right  --  whether , after all , Dirck was the man she should marry . This man , I was realizing with a sudden sense of consternation , under his surface charm had a hard streak , an unsuspected capacity for ruthlessness , and I knew with swift certainty that after all I did n't want Katrien to marry him . Then abruptly that unpleasant look was gone and his boyish charm had reasserted itself . " Of course , " he said with lifted eyebrows and a sorry littleDESIGN IN DIAMONDS 121smile , " I would n't marry any girl who was n't sure she wanted to marry me  --  not even Katrien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car skirted the Zocalo and threaded the narrow streets of the old city , he was quiet , evidentlythinking over this new turn in his affairs . It was not until we had swung into the Avenida des Insurgentes that he turned to me again . " How about Katrien 's property ? You 've turned it over to her , of course ? " At the frank , sincere sound of his voice I crushed down that momentary feeling of antipathy . Surely I must have been mistakenin attributing any unpleasant characteristics to this amiable young man . " As a matter of fact  --  no . Not yet . " His brows went up in courteous surprise . " But I thought  --  as soon as you got here I faced him soberly . " She is n't herself , Anselmo . For one thing , she refused to discuss the matter with me at all  --  asked me to take it up with Dirck . But the peculiar thing about that was that she had n't told Dirck about the  --  well , you know  --  the password @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and obviously he 's never heard about it . " His mouth twisted in a little half-smile . " Hm , I see . So naturallyyou did n't care to do business with him . " " I 'm not going to turn it over to anybody , not even to Katrien herself , until I 'm sure she 's well enough to take care of it . She might so easily be persuaded to do something she would regret later on . " " Yes , of course , " he agreed . And after a moment he went on thoughtfully , " I 'll talk to her about it if you like . She 'd discussed it with me , you know . I might be able to make her realizethe importance of getting the thing settled up . " " I wish you would , " I said gratefully . " I 've had a feeling that when you came we could straighten it out . Since she 'd en-122 DESIGN IN DIAMONDStrusted you with the password and the device , naturally you 're the one I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little movement and his eyes darted significantlytoward the stolid back of the chauffeur , and it occurred to me that he , too , suspected every listening ear . " Yes , I will do it . Leave it in my hands , " he said in a low tone . And by tacit consent we dropped the subject . Fifteen minutes later the car swung around the inn grounds , turned into the tree-shaded lane that led to Casa del Seto , and drew up at the big wrought-iron gate . At our ring Luz came running to unlock it . " This gentleman wishes to see Miss ter Brock " I began in my halting Spanish , but Anselrno broke in with a swift , fluent question . Luz shook her head , and there was a spark of pleased excitement dancing in her eyes as she responded . I saw anger and consternation leap into Anselmo 's face , and he snapped out a couple more curt questions . Then he turned to Corey and me , and his voice had a defeated , almost sullen sound . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And this woman says they have gone to be married . " CHAPTER XXIAT COREY 'S SUGGESTION the three of us went to the inn for lunch . Then we strolled back to Casa del Seto and sat for a long while on the vine-shaded terrace , making desultory conversation . Anselmo , it was evident , was interested in only one thing  --  Katrien 's return  --  and he made perfunctory , monosyllabic responsesto our successive chatty comments on the weather , the altitude , and the international situation . And after a while I gave it up . DESIGN IN DIAMONDS 123 " Never mind , Anselmo , " I said . " You do n't need to talk . We understand . " He grinned appreciatively . " I am very poor company . If you will excuse me , I think I will go down in the garden and walk a bit . That plane trip was very tiring . " He strode down the steps into the formal garden and began to pace up and down the gravel paths , smoking furiously . Corey and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have nothing to say , picked up magazines and settled down comfortably to wait . It was late in the afternoon when Katrien and Dirck returned . We heard them coming through the garden while they were still some distance away . Dirck 's voice was deep and resonant , with a sort of ebullience in it . And then in response Katrien laughed . It was the first time we had heard anything from her even faintly approaching a laugh , and it had a gay , confident sound  --  a sound that was almost impudent in its assurance . It seemed almost incredible that such a sound could come from the heartsick , defeated girl of a few short hours ago . I looked at Corey , and his face had a comical look of astonishment . " Marriage has sure done a lot for her in a short time , " he muttered . Below us , in the formal garden , Anselmo had flung away his cigarette and stood waiting tautly , his eyes fixed on the flowery arbor through which they must pass . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She saw Anselmo and stopped short . She was wearing a sheer white frock and a big hat of lacy white straw , and she made a lovely picture poised there against the flaming mass of the flower-laden vines . For one tense , pregnant moment she stood there motionless , staring at him with eyes that had a wide , frightened look , and I saw the happy , excited color drain out of her face and the old strained look come back . " Anselmo ! " she whispered. d124 DESIGN IN DIAMONDSThen Dirck was at her side and his arm was about her shoulders . I heard him say softly : " It 's all right , dear . There 's nothing to be afraid of . " Then they were coming along the path , and Anselmo wasstriding forward to meet them . He did not offer to shake hands . " Well , Katrien , I 'm back , " he said curtly . " Anselmo , " she said , and her voice sounded queerly hollow , as if the life had gone out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry  --  I do n't know how to tell you " " Let me tell him , " Dirck said brusquely . " Anselmo , old man , Katrien and I were married this noon . That 's the way it had to be . We 've loved each other a long time . " Katrien stepped forward impulsively and put her hand on Anselmo 's sleeve . " Please understand . I 'm so sorry " He drew his arm away sharply , as if her touch were repulsive to him , and his voice had a harsh , coldly impersonal sound . " I understand perfectly  --  you need n't go into any rhapsodic explanations . But if you do n't mind I should like to have a little private talk with you , Katrien . It may have slipped your mind for the moment , but you may recall that I went to the States on a little matter of business for you . " She drew a quivering breath . " I know  --  and I feel dread-fully " I 'd like to make my report at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said formally . She nodded miserably . " All right , Anselmo . . . . Do you mind if Dirck comes with us ? " " I should mind very much , " he said curtly . " My business is with you alone , Katrien . What you do about it afterward is your own affair . " She looked at him pathetically . " We-e-ll -- let 's go up to my room . " Dirck 's eyes followed them with a narrow , wary look . ThenDESIGN IN DIAMONDS 125with an angry mutter he turned on his heel and strode away in the other direction . For a long moment after the three had disappearedCorey and I sat in silence . He broke it finally . " Maybe Katrien knows what she 's doing . There 's something about that guy Anselmo that sort of comes out in the wash . Swell guy when you first meet him and when things are breaking his way . But he is n't much of a loser . Know what I mean ? " " Yes , I know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my life when my first judgment of a man has been badly off , I think . He 's not the sort of man I thought he was at all . " Corey rose . " You do n't need me any longer , do you ? I 've got a few things I want to do . A bit of snooping into Herr Grynsbach'simmediate past , for one thing . Do n't want to leave any loose ends dangling . Poor old duffer , if we 're going to consign him to a suicide 's grave , the least we can do is see that it 's done neatly . " " You 're a comfort , Corey , " I said . " Give me a ring later . " When he had gone I went up to my own room . As I crossed the landing between my door and Katrien 's I heard the low murmur of voices , and I knew suddenly that Katrien was crying and that Anselmo was insisting on something . Then a few words came to me . His voice sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it somehow , between you . I ca n't do anything more for you now . " Katrien was sobbing , and her sobs had a hysterical sound . " But I ca n't ! You told me I would n't have to  --  you prom-ised " " It 's out of my hands now . You should have thought of this before you went into this insane marriage . You might at least have waited " I went hastily into my own room and closed the door softly . Corey was right ; Anselmo seemed a bad loser . I had very little confidence now in his offer of help in settling Katrien 's business126 DESIGN IN DIAMONDSaffairs . His vanity , I thought , was badly hurt , and he was entirelytoo self-centered , too conscious of injury , to be capable of real friendship for the girl he had once loved . And once again I was glad that Dirck was the man she had married  --  since marry she must , apparently . I never knew what actually went on in Katrien 's room that afternoon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined Katrien and Anselmo , for when I started down for dinner a long time later the door was open and the three of them were talking together . Recriminations had evidently been exhausted , for they were talking quietly and in apparent amiability . When they saw me conversation halted abruptly , and Anselmo threw up a hand and beckoned to me . " Oh , Miss Blair ! Come in a minute , will you ? " he called . " I 've just been talking to Katrien about that little business matter of yours . I think you wo n't have any more trouble about it . " I stepped across the threshold . " I 'll be delighted to finish it up promptly . Let 's have a little talk about it in the morning , Katrien . You 're looking a lot better , my dear . I do n't mind admitting now that I was a bit worried about you . " She gave me a shyly apologetic smile . " I guess I was pretty unreasonable , Miss Blair . It just seemed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was so frightfully unhappy . But now everything 's all right . Anselmo 's been so sweet and under-standing . " Dirck put his arm about her and dropped a kiss on the top of her head . " I do n't think you need to explain , precious . " He glanced up at me with a smile . " There are papers , of course , that she should sign . Any time you say , Miss Blair . " " Tomorrow morning , then , " I repeated , and went down the stairs . DESIGN IN DIAMONDS 127CHAPTER XXIIAT DINNER THAT NIGHT , for the first time since I had been in Casa del Seto , there seemed to be an atmosphere of complete friendliness and congeniality . It was a distinct relief , even though I was well aware that it was at best a superficial thing . Katrien and Dirck had persuaded Anselmo to remain for dinner , and the conversation between them had evidently cleared the air , for Anselmo himself showed none of his former bitter disappointment and resentment and was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good dinner in honor of the bridal pair , and she and Fritz between them managed to create a festive feeling . Katrien sat in the place of honor at the head of the table , with Dirck at her right , and I was amazed at the sparkle in her eyes and the gay timbre of happiness in her voice . Anna , in an exotic costume of flame red , devoted herself to Anselmo , and I noticed with a little shock that he was distinctlyintrigued by her smoldering black eyes and pouting scarletmouth . Anselmo , I decided , watching their absorption in each other , had become reconciled very quickly to the loss of the girl he had professed to love so deeply . Sean O'Shane , however , offered the greatest surprise of all . Whether by accident or some mischievous design of her own , Ellen had seated him beside me , and to my astonishment he proceeded to devote himself to me with the most flattering attention , to the exclusion of everybody else at the table . By tacit consent we avoided any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he launched immediately into the story of his life . Apparently , by regaling me with an account of his musical successes in London , Milan , Paris , and other con-128 DESIGN IN DIAMONDStinental capitals , he intended to convey to me the priceless boon of his forgiveness . It was only when I happened to glance up at a sudden halt in the flow of his words and saw his eyes , sullen and hostile , watching Anna across the table , that I understood . Sean recovered himself abruptly and picked up smoothly the O'Shane saga . " But it was in Berlin that I really came into my own , that I at last became recognized as one of the greatest  --  if not the greatest  --  Wagnerian tenors that the world has been privileged to hear , " he intoned . " There have not been many of us , you know , dear lady . Even the great Caruso could not sing Wagner . When I sang Siegfried for the first time Berlin went wild . I had not only the voice of Siegfried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the complete personification of the Siegfried idea . I have been told by artists "  --  he lowered his voice modestly  --  " that the measurements of my body correspond exactly with those of the Hermes of Praxiteles . I speak of this quite without conceit , you understand : I am not responsible for it . " He paused while his superb hermaic jaws efficiently masticateda mouthful of breast of chicken ; then he went on : " On the operatic stage , dear lady , in the role of Siegfried , I think I may permit myself to say that I am magnificent . " Across the table Dr. Lewers was sitting at Ellen Prather 's right . I looked up and caught his eyes , and a little spark of amusement and something like understanding flickered swiftly between us . I had seen it before  --  that little twinkle of appreciationthat recognized me as a kindred soul in a bizarre company . I let my left eyelid drop in the faintest suggestion of a wink . Just then Ellen gave a soft exclamation . " Oh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a party , would n't it be a good idea to have your mango chutney ? " I had forgotten all about that mango chutney myself , since I had turned it over to her keeping on my arrival . Now I agreedDESIGN IN DIAMONDS 129enthusiastically with the suggestion , and she murmured something to Cristina . She left the room and returned a moment later with the jar in her hands and put it down on the table before me . I picked it up dramatically . " If you do n't all agree that this is the best chutney youever 9 , The words died abruptly on my tongue . I was staring in completeamazement at the little jar in my hands , and my brain seemed to be spinning in mad convolutions . It was a squat little brown jar of native pottery , of a type which seemed to be very common , from the amount of it I had seen in Ellen Prather 's house . But if the pottery itself was common , the decorative designit bore was not . Daubed across its rounded belly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the unmistakable representation of the device of the Trylon and Perisphere . My face must have shown the amazement and utter mental confusion I was feeling , for the conversation around the table had been suspended in mid-air , as it were , and they were all staring at me . " What 's the matter , Miss Blair ? " Dirck asked jocularly . " Sure it 's chutney  --  and not T.N.T. ? " I gulped hastily , and across the table my eyes sought Anselmo'sin a desperate appeal for co-operation . But he , apparently , had not noticed anything out of the ordinary . One brown pottery jar , I suppose , was just like any other to him . " There 's nothing wrong with it , is there ? " Ellen asked anxiously . " Oh no ! " I gasped . My voice sounded like something that did not belong to me . " I was just  --  looking at the jar . It 's so  --  un-usual . " She smiled . " Not to us , my dear . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want for twenty-five centavos apiece ! " 130 DESIGN IN DIAMONDS " Really ? " I gushed . " Oh , I must take some home with me ! Where did this one come from ? " " Why , you brought it yourself ! Cristina "  --  she lapsed into swift Spanish  --  " this is the same jar in which the senorita brought the chutney ? " " Si , senora , " the girl said . " Lo mismo . " I smiled and lifted my shoulders in what I hoped was a normal gesture . " It was wrapped up , so I did n't see it . Senora  --  a friend  --  gave it to me . " Once more I looked at Anselmo , and as I put the jar down on the table I managed to turn it so that the decorative design faced him , but he was oblivious to its significance . People never really see things that are familiar to them , I reflected exasperatedly . " But where , " I persisted , " does this type of thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handicraft . Is n't it possible to tell where it is made ? " Ellen looked perplexed . " Yes , of course , but I 'm not very good at such things . They all look alike to me . I buy them down at the San Juan market " " Of course you can tell ! " Fritz said a trifle impatiently . " I should think , after all these years , Ellen , you 'd have caught onto the characteristic signs . That one , without much question , comes from around Teportlan . " " Teportlan , " I repeated , trying to fix the strange word in my memory . " Is that far from here ? " " A hundred kilometers more or less , " he said carelessly . " I do n't know exactly . Have to take a roundabout road . " And suddenly I was no longer listening to Fritz 's explanationas to the best way to reach Teportlan . I was listening insteadto the tingling quality of the silence around the dinner table , hearing the silent menace of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the long table . Eight pairs of eyesDESIGN IN DIAMONDS 131were fixed upon me  --  eyes that were wary , speculative , hostile , perplexed ; my hasty glance gave me only a confusing composite of them all . Then Ellen came to my rescue matter-of-factly . " Well , it 's that marvelous chutney of yours we 're interested in , Margot , not the jar . Are n't you going to let us have some ? " " Of course , " I said , and passed it to her . And sat , in quivering agony , while it passed from hand to hand . It seemed inconceivablethat some one of those wary , curious people around the table should not notice the design upon it  --  a design that never could have originated in the native Mexican village of Teportlan . But the miracle happened . The jar made the complete circuit of the table and returned to its place before me , and no one mentioned the alien pattern of its ornamentation . Slowly my heart resumed a normal beat . " If you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will drive you out to Teportlan someday , Miss Blair . You would find it one of the most picturesque villages in this part of Mexico . I have done some ethnological research there . " " Thank you , " I said , grateful to him for restoring the conversation to a casual level . " I 'd love to see it . " During the remainder of the dinner hour no further referencewas made either to Teportlan or to the little brown jug , but that curious sense of wary menace persisted , and it was with a distinct feeling of relief that I rose from the table at last . And as soon as I felt that a graceful exit was possible I excused myselfon the ground of a slight headache and announced my intention of going straight to bed . When I reached the foot of the circular staircase , however , I cast a wary glance back at the main part of the house I had left . The patio was dark and deserted , and only the pale rectanglesof light that seeped through the drawn living-room curtainsindicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had left all the others behind me in the living room ; at least , I thought I had . But suddenly I wondered with a panicky182 DESIGN IN DIAMONDSfeeling of uncertainty whether I might have been mistaken . For my pulses were pounding crazily to the consciousness of a sinister , watchful presence here in the patio with me  --  of eyes that , even in the dark , followed every movement that I made . Imagination , I told myself severely , and nerves made jittery by the events of the past few hours . I cast one more fearful glance about the shadowed patio . There was no hint of movement  --  nosound . . . . I drew in a soft , quivering breath , tiptoed down the dark steps at the side of the pool , and ducked silently into the black tunnel of the path that led through the oleander thicket to the gate . CHAPTER XXIIICOREY was smoking on the terrado at the inn when I ran up the path . He flung his cigarette over the rail and leaped to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's the matter ? You look as if you 'd Here , sit down and collect yourself . " He yanked forward a chair and I dropped down in it breathlessly . " Thank the Lord I found you , Corey , " I gasped . " If I 'd had to go twenty yards farther I 'd have been a gibbering maniac . Look out there and see if anybody 's following me . " He grunted something under his breath and darted silently to the end of the terrado where he could look down the length of the shadowy lane . Presently he came back . " There 's no sign of anybody out there . But that does n't mean anything , of course . Could n't see anything short of a herd of yaks in that dark lane . Who did you think it was ? " " I do n't know ! " I moaned with a quiver in my voice that I could not seem to control . " It may have been pure funk . Corey , DESIGN IN DIAMONDS 133this thing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Mango chutney ? " He sounded bewildered . " Senora Colin gave it to me . The maid came running out with it when we left . " He nodded . " Sure . I remember now . But what on earth ? " " It was in a little brown pottery jar . " I said the words portentously . " And the jar , believe it or not , has the Trylon and Perisphere on it ! " His stocky figure squared , and there was bewilderment and incredulity in every line . " Now wait a minute , Margot ! Tell it to me in words of one syllable . Where is this jar , and how the devil " The jar , " I snapped , " was on the dinner table , with the Trylon and Perisphere staring me straight in the face . And so was everybody else in the cockeyed house ! My dear , talk about electricity in the atmosphere ! You could have struck a spark off any one of us ! " " No doubt , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get there ? Did Katrien see it  --  or did she know about it all the time ? " " Nobody saw it but me  --  at least , I do n't think they did . But they saw me , " I groaned . " The instant they saw my blanched countenance and starting eyes they knew something was very much afoot . . . . The jar , I did manage to learn , was undoubtedlymade in the Indian village of Teportlan  --  wherever that is . But that does n't explain the Trylon and Perisphere . I have n't the remotest idea how it got on the jar . I suppose it 's just barely possible that somebody from Teportlan went to the World 's Fair and brought it back for use as a tribal symbol . " I said it sarcastically . He grunted . " Fat chance . Did n't you say anything to anybody  --  Anselmoor Katrien ? " I shook my head . " I 'm getting to the point where I 'm afraid to open my mouth  --  even to you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame you . What are you going to do ? " " Call up Senora Colin and find out where she got that jar . " He made a grimace . " Elementary  --  but you would be the one to think of it . Let 's get her on the phone right away . " Roberto , the Colin butler , answered the phone . La Senora , he said , was occupied . If I would be good enough to state my message he would transmit it and bring her reply . That , I told him , would not do at all ; I must speak with the senora in person . I must have managed to convey my urgency to him , for he said : " En seguido , por favor , " and presently I heard the cool autocraticvoice of Senora Colin herself . " Forgive me , senora , " I said , " and please believe that it is important , or I should not have troubled you . You gave me a jar of mango chutney  --  one of your maids brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " She did ? " Her voice showed impersonal surprise . " I had forgotten all about it . " " It was in a little brown pottery jar , like a marmalade jar , with a cover . Can you tell me where that jar came from ? " " Certainly not ! " She sounded distinctly irritated , and in my heart I did not blame her . She must have thought it a very clumsy attempt to resume diplomatic relations . " They can be bought , I presume , in any of the markets . " " Please ! " I broke in , fearful lest she hang up her receiver . " This is really important , Senora Colin . It is quite possibly a matter of life and death . You must help me if you can . " " I do n't understand , " she began frigidly . " Did you ever hear of the Trylon and Perisphere ? " I cut in bluntly . I did n't think she had , but I thought it might arouse he7 interest . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What has the  --  the Trylon and Perisphere to do with the brown jar ? " " It was on it . " It was n't a very sensible-sounding sentence , DESIGN IN DIAMONDS 135but she understood what I meant , and astonishingly she asked no further questions . " Will you please wait for a moment ? I will inquire of the servants , " she said brusquely , and I thought there was a different , warmer sound in her voice . And presently she spoke again . " My servants tell me a rather surprising story about that little jar , Senorita Blair . An itinerant peddler brought it to the gate the very afternoon of your arrival . When they refused to buy he insisted on leaving it , without pay , and told them it was a present for the senora . They thought it was a matter of no importance and did not mention it to me . When I told them to give you a jar of chutney one of the maids picked up that empty jar which was still standing on the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My heart was thudding with hard , painful hammer strokes . One by one the pieces of the puzzle were dropping into their calculated pattern  --  a pattern which as yet I could not even faintly discern . But it was as though I had known what she was going to say without understanding why . " Where did the man come from ? " " The maids did not know . " Her voice sounded kind now and rather concerned . " But if I may hazard a guess , judging from the type of pottery as they described it to me , and from the fact that the man came on foot , I should say that the most likely place would be Teportlan . " Once more something clicked into place , and I had a sense of inevitability  --  a momentary glimpse of the pattern . " Thank you , " I said . " You 've been very kind " One moment , Miss Blair , " she interrupted . " It happens that I have been hearing about the Trylon and Perisphere within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is here now , and he would like to speak to you . If you will hold the line for a moment only " " Your son ! There  --  in Cuernavaca ? " My voice came out in a136 DESIGN IN DIAMONDSsort of thin squeal . " But he 's here  --  I saw him not ten minutes ago . " " Hello , Miss Blair . " At the sound of that resonant masculine voice my brain seemed to go into a complete tailspin . For I knew suddenly and with complete conviction that this was the voice I had heard over my office telephone in New York a few days before . And I knew , too , in that instant , though I could not have told how , that I had not heard that same voice since . " This is Anselmo Colin . " " Wait a minute , " I begged . " Just let me get my breath for a minute . Where did you come from  --  and where have you been ? " He chuckled a trifle grimly . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about it when we have more time . Right now I want to know what all this means  --  about the Trylon and Peri-sphere ? " " I wish I knew . All I can tell you is that somebody has daubed it , in dark brown paint , on the side of a little pottery jug that apparently came from a town called Teportlan " He cut in abruptly : " Where 's Ii ; atrien ? " " Right here in San Angel . But there are a lot of things you ought to know , Anselmo . . . . She married Dirck van Ryper this afternoon 95 " Katrien married ? " he roared . " I do n't want to call you aliar , Miss Blair " But it 's true , " I wailed unhappily . He made a queer , explosive sound . " I 'll be there in an hour . I was just going to start anyway , but I did n't know she needed me  --  that way . Tell her I 'm coming , that I love her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And listen  --  get this , Miss Blair  --  go to her , wherever she is , and stay with her until I come . No matter what she says . " " My dear man , it 's her wedding night ! " " You 've grasped the point exactly . She may be married toDESIGN IN DIAMONDS 137Dirck van Ryper , but she 's not going to be his wife  --  not till I 've had a chance to talk to her anyway . . . . Watch out for me ; I 'll make it in just one hour flat . " " I 'll be at the gate , " I promised . " And I 'll bring Katrien with me if I can . " CHAPTER XXIVBuT after I had hung up the receiver and had time to collect my thoughts I began to realize the complications of this fresh development . Significant things that at the moment of hearing the voice of the real Anselmo I had been too bewildered , too aghast , to remember now assaulted my brain . " My lord , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what this means ? We 've laid practically the whole deck of cards on the table face up for this phony Anselmo ! " For once in his happy-go-lucky life Corey 's face had a stunned look . " You 're telling me ! How long do you figure it 's been going on  --  this impersonation , I mean ? When did you see the real one last ? " " I never saw him ! This is the man who talked to me on the phone and made the appointment at La Maisonette . He undoubtedlywrote the note making the appointment at Mena 's apartment . From that point on , something tells me , the bogus one took over . " " But how ? Whose blood was it on the ? " " Your guess is just as good as mine ! " I snapped a trifle frantically . " And I do n't know how he put over the hospital stunt  --  I should have said it could n't be done . Certainly the whole staff of Mercy Hospital is n't embroiled in a Nazi conspiracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The important thing is to try to figure out how much he knows and what he 's going to do with it . " " I hate to be discouraging , old thing , " he said lugubriously , " but if you 're asking me , I should say he knew everything . As you so pertinently remarked , we seem to have opened up to him high , wide , and handsome . . . . One thing we are sure of  --  he knows the important thing , the magic talisman . " It must have been the deadly importance of the words that pulled my racing brain up short . Such things do happen , I know . Whatever the explanation , that frantic sense of desperationand panic was gone , and suddenly my mind was coldly , lucidly sober and my memory miraculously sure . " What makes you think he does ? " " Why , you said so yourself ! " " Yes , but did he ? " Corey stared at me , his brow wrinkled . " Well , if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute . Let me think . Anselmo  --  the real one  --  mentioned the Trylon and Perisphere over the phone when he called me that first day . He drew it on the note he sent from the Waldorf . But I  --  do n't  --  think "  --  I was bringing up , fragment by fragment , from the deep well of memory , that conversation at the bedside  --  " that it was mentioned when we saw him in the hospital . " " We figured Karl and the mastermind must have read the note  --  to know about the appointment , " he pointed out . I nodded thoughtfully . " I remember just how that note looked . He 'd scrawled the Trylon and Perisphere hastily , simply with two lines  --  a tall , inverted V and a rough circle beside it . Unless I 'd known what I was looking for I 'd never have recognizedit . It looked like the sort of scrawl you might make if your pen did n't flow very well and you took a couple of quick strokes to clear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't know , " he said pessimistiillDESIGN IN DIAMONDS 139 tally . " But one thing I do know  --  on the way in from the air- 1p,1 ort he certainly had the dope on the Trylon and Perisphere . You both talked about it . " " Wait a minute ! " The memory of that conversation was crystal-clear now . " He did n't know about it ! I mentioned the fact that he was the one to whom Katrien had given the secret , and he shut me up on the subject very abruptly  --  do n't you remember ? I thought it was because he was afraid the taxi driver might overhear , but that was n't it at all ! It was because he did n't know what the password was , and he was afraid if we si continued the conversation I 'd find out that he did n't know ! Do n't you see , Corey , he 's in a spot ! He ca n't press the matter either with Katrien or with me for fear one of us will ask him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice , quiet , cagey game until Katrien -- or I  --  happen to mention it to him again ! " Corey shrugged . " I would n't want to be in his shoes . Looks to me like he 's not only playing a cagey game but a damn dangerousone . What does he expect to do when the real Anselmo shows up ? He must know that 'll happen before long . " " I do n't think he expects that to happen at all , " I said soberly . " I think their plan slipped badly ; if it had n't , the real Anselmo would be dead . " Corey cocked an eye at me . " In that case , it wo n't be long before the phony one finds out he is n't . Something tells me we 'd better start moving  --  fast  --  if we want to catch him off base . But listen , Margot , he must be a dead ringer for the real one , to have fooled Katrien . Had you thought about that ? " " Of course I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen the real one , I 'm not in a position to give an opinion , but I know they can do perfectly uncanny things with make-up . They 're undoubtedly the same fundamental type to start with  --  tall , slim , olive-skinned , dark-eyed . And then remember that Katrien had not seen him since before the invasion , except for those few days after she arrived here , when she was sick and mentally
