 | " And what did you like best ? " His hopes were high when he asked the question . They were higher than those of the average older man embarked on an expedition with his young godson . Although such hopes can be high , these could claim an even more dizzying altitude . They soared in the heart of an author . Not of a man who merely has written a book and happens upon a friend reading it . No , these were the hopes of a dramatist who had gone , proudly , expectantly , to see a play of his writing , accompanied by his godson . To a Matinee of Peter Pan , his own Peter Pan , Sir James Barrie had taken his godchild , the very young son of that Captain Scott who perished gallantly at the South Pole . Barrie and the boy had watched the performance from a box . The afternoon was a happy one . It was only when they had left the theatre and were on their way home that Barrie conquered his shyness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not resist it . " And what did you like best ? " According to the story , there was a pause , an ominous pause . Then the boy 's face lighted up . " I think , " he said , and his smile was blissful , " I think what I really liked best , Uncle Jamie , was dropping that program down on those people 's heads . " As we grow older , the pleasures theatregoing gives us are not likely to be either so simple or so direct . Although they remain manifold , they are not brought about by the mere act of journeying to see a play . If the theatre is an art , so to a certain extent is theatregoing . It is not by any means a lost art , but it is one all of us frequently misplace . We misplace it for various reasons . The old war whoop against critics maintains that if they have not dined well they do not like , the play . To true theatregoers , however ( including the critics ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to . The dinner they have eaten is at its best an appetizer for the feast to follow . One of the surest ways not to enjoy a play is to have dined too well before it . Nonetheless , there is a dietary trouble from which both professional reviewers and citizens of any dramatic capital suffer . We are @#  | overfed . Starvation does not whet our appetites . As Charles Lamb once pointed out , when speaking of " what is offered by the playhouses , " the relish of such exhibitions must be in proportion to the infrequency of going . " The people who live in Texas or Iowa and drive happily two hundred miles see Miss Cornell , Miss Hayes , Mr. Evans or the Lunts may envy us our surfeit But we have just as much reason to cove ? . their hunger . For them theatregoing an occasion ; for many in large cities tends to become either a profession .. obligation or part of a winter routine They have the added pleasures of anticipation , of planning . What they embark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theatre is an outing , if fo : no other reason than that it is an excuse for al rip . They bring not only themselves to the theatre ; they bring their cravin for it , too . They do n't drop their programin the aisles , as most New Yorkers dc They take them home as trophies . When and if , they reach New York or Chicago ( and are lucky enough to get seats ) , the : : go on orgies of make-believe . During the nights and matinees they are there , th=-theatre is for them more than a diversion It is a food they have been denied , a d in ; : they could not buy , tobacco they were unable to purchase . It remains an ever : : with none of its wonder worn away indeed , the very event it should remain for all of us . THERE are ways , however , in which -a e can enhance , though not guarantee , this pleasures and eventfulness of our theatregoing . We ought to go to the theatre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day : not fretting because we have to go out not fuming because of some busine worry or family trial that refuses to qu : : our minds ; but rested ? and fresh . Bettea nap beforehand than during . Our impatience should be to have a performance begin rather than to have it over . A former critic , a Greenwich Village independent of the old arty days , used e refuse to dress for the theatre . " Waiters. - he was fond of muttering , " are the onl : : men who dress to go to work . " Yet , inasmuch as people do dress for swimmir. ( which is , after all , only another form ti group immersion ) and do dress win . equal cheerfulness for every other font of sport or exercise , I can see no vain= reason they should be unwilling to dress when they exercise their perceptions that special form of indoor sport whitis the theatre . The point is to have a playgoers look better than they ordinari. : . do . Although dressing may not turthem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledgment that , for them , the evening is a special one . To keep our theatregoing special , oth precautions might be taken . Such , fo example , as avoiding theatre parties lik the plague . They arrive late and elute up the aisles at those awful moments during which the hostess is telling Muriel , Henry , Ethel , Tom , Winifred , and Jce ( and the occupants of the next five rows where Muriel , Henry , Ethel , Tom , Winfred , and Joe should sit . Theatre parties destroy concentration for they make conversation from the moment of their arrival until the curta. falls . Mass movements may be fine f school children , Chinatown buses , and @#  | Boy Scouts on a hike . But in the presence of a proscenium arch , two 's company and three 's a bore . The aisle of a theatre resembles the gangplank of the Ark , at least to this extent ? it ought to be traversed in twos . Even this is no safeguard . A lot can depend on who the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being seen in the company of the wrong person than by being acted by the wrong company . The right person , needless to say , is not merely a person with whom tastes are shared . The right person is also a person who has the gift of sustained silence . She ( I speak from the male point of view ) may excel at the language of nudges , nods , and exchanged smiles or sneers . She may cry , laugh , yawn , or frown at the same times you do . She may appear to halt her breathing during the identical climaxes and , without any signal being exchanged , applaud the same scenes or actors . But she does not repeat the comedian 's jokes in senatorial tones , on the assumption that the rest of the cast may have missed their cues . She does not indulge in loud " oh 's " and " all 's " if the plot is sad . And she does not proclaim , with a trainman 's reticence , what is coming next as the plot is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soothsayers , and let not only the dramatist speak for himself but the audience grasp for itself . If the right person has a cold , she warns you in advance . She does not wait to tell the audience and the actors . She has both the manners and the sense of hygiene to stay home , where all coughers and sneezers belong and where they should be kept by law . F SHE wears a hat , she either takes it off cheerfully upon arrival or asks the people behind her if it obstructs their view . She does not wait for them to lean forward , five or ten minutes after the curtain has risen , to hiss a request that never should have had to be made . If she wears a coat , she removes this , too , long before the house lights are dimmed . What I is more , she has it placed so as to insure her comfort and its longevity well in I advance of the overture . She does not suddenly stand up after the curtain has risen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of her watches with anything save resentment , and which serves only to disarrange the hair of the ' woman sitting in front of her . So far as her evening bag is concerned , she examines its contents before leaving home . She does not surprise herself with them by strewing them across her lap , so that any latecomer , without meaning to , will send them clattering to the floor , After reading her program , she is careful to hold it without first screwing it into a funnel , and then , out of nervousness or perversity , scrunching and expanding it until it functions like a calliope until the lights go on again . If she must carry chocolates in a paper bag , she is sweet enough to leave the bag unrustled until the intermission . She is willing to leave it to the players to make the evening 's entrances and exits . However worth seeing she herself may be , she comes to see , not to be seen . Her first thought ? at least for that part of the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where yours should be centered , too . If , in other words , you as a man are as carefree , as coat-free , and  | as ungiven to running comment as y expect her to be and are as eager as yes trust she is to enjoy what you are seei.g without making it impossible for others to do likewise ? why , then , the two of ycz can qualify as being playhousebroken . BUT there is more to theatregoing thmere good manners . Far more . Beyo. the surrender of self-interest , of whi such good manners should be only unconscious expression , there is the qu = tion of the surrender of self . This is as old as the first audience , and far newer than the most recent book on crowd psychology . Fortunately , without having to be aware of it , each of us faced it tie last time we went to the theatre and w : face it again when next we go . Every individual playgoer becomes more than an individual . He continues in part to be himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a audience . He is " man solitary " and " man aggregate " at the same time . For ties ' reason he laughs at what would leave him unamused at home and is moved by what might not have touched him had been alone . The person who can not lose himself an audience is as.cheated of the theatre final pleasures as the one who loses hi : - self entirely . The simplest joys known to playgoe. are those we all knew as children . Th we doubted nothing . We believed ever. : thing . All that we saw exceeded our ex pectations , because we did not know w ' : . to expect . We were blissfully untroub : then by standards , because we did have any . No memories of what had b haunted our vision . We could not p. tend to judge what should be , because had no knowledge of what had been might be . The only lights we saw by were the on the stage . Our ears were so filled the voices of the actors that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep within ourselves that has so stu ' born a way of insisting either that is not well or that everything is fine , a. formulating the reasons quite coldly . Instead of trying to silence this inn - voice , all of us should thank it for promptings . We should welcome it ev when seemingly we are fused parts of audience . Because , if we respect t. theatre , we do not as adults surrender it unthinkingly . We think too much of for that . The delights with which it c provide us are far subtler and rich . We want it to conquer us as individu no less than members of a crowd , with crowd 's strangely but inevitably lower ' . standards . Not that our resistance shou ' be hostile . Instead , it should be a frienc : combativeness . In other words , though -. t want the theatre to win us on this or to_the night , we should not want it to win peace without victory . The conquest our judgment , like the satisfaction of o ? senses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us into the most ale awareness instead of lulling us into dullest , or most moronic , acceptance . One of the theatre 's deathless fascirtions is that what it offers can not cla complete life until it lives again each ti. behind the footlights . However perfect by repetition this may seem to be , it human enough to vary from performar. to performance . It changes nightly - . only because of those on stage but a ' because of those out front . Even with ou standing successes , the best performan -  | are not necessarily those given on first ' nights . They can be the worst . The best performances may come late or early in a run , in New York or on the road . Although these find the theatre at its most eventful , their coming is beyond prophecy . They depend on playgoers no less than players . They occur when the two , so to speak , are in conjunction . There are audiences that kill by their coldness or discourage by their dullness . Fortunately , there also are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actors , fine playwrights , or fine anything else . When , by some miracle , such audiences fill an auditorium , actors sense them almost at once . They are stimulated by them . They rise happily to meet the challenge not of indifference but of friendliness . For friendliness is something to be lived up to as surely as indifference is something that must be lived down . This challenging friendliness is what we ought to take to the theatre both as individuals and as members of an audience . That is , if we would provoke the theatre into giving us its best . We have our work to do out front no less surely than those backstage . Unless they make it impossible , we should do this gladly , for the pleasure of our theatregoing de-1 pends to a large extent on our being able j and willing to do it .
