In The New Yorker three years ago Poet E. B. White set down an appraisal of Radioracle Harold Thomas Henry ( Boake ) Carter . Wrote he : I like to hear him summon us With all things ominous : Munitions makers , plotting gain , Asylums bulging with insane , Cancers that give no hint of pain , Insurgency in northern Spain , And rivers swollen with the rain . For Boake , Has spoke , And it 's no joke . <P> No joke indeed were the broadcasts of Boake Carter . In his peremptory , clipped British baritone , he gloomed about C. I. O. , Communism , the state of military aviation , the Roosevelt Administration , the British Empire . For accusing Governor Hoffman of New Jersey of making a political football of the Lindbergh case , he was sued for $100,000 ( later the suit was settled amicably ) ; for baiting C. I. O. , he was picketed at Philadelphia 's WCAU , from which his program originated . He was called a " mercenary poseur " by the late Newsman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Harold Ickes . Nevertheless his following was enormous , and when Philco Radio and Television Corp . failed to renew his contract in 1938 , he was snapped up by General Foods . But when his contract ran out , General Foods did not sign him up again . <P> When Carter vacated the networks , he was cashing in at the rate of $150,000 a year . Since then he has earned $550 a week with a syndicated column that goes to 52 papers , gets $500 apiece from lectures . But neither medium has given him the satisfaction he used to get out of an ethereal brood . This week that satisfaction will be his , for he begins ( at $1,000 a week ) as commentator for United Air Lines over an MBS coast-to-coast network . <P> Carter 's United show will be the first regular coast-to-coast program ever sponsored by an airline . Idea behind it is to get business in the winter months when air travel slacks off . In the nature of a test campaign , the program , which Carter himself promoted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be piped without commercials to many an MBS station remote from United 's route . No fear has United that Carter will alienate any of its customers . The company feels his truculent past will attract listeners , while his knowledge of air transportation will give the show an entertaining professional flavor . Carter , who served in the R. A. F. in World War I , is an airplane fan , has traveled over 200,000 miles by air , fancies himself as an expert on aviation problems . A chum of United 's President William Patterson , he will be closely watched in his newscasting by N. W. Ayer and MBS , will try to keep his program " in good taste and without controversy . " <P> Unusually subdued is Boake Carter today . " When you 've suddenly had the ground cut from under you , " he says , " your sense of values is restored . " Although he intends to vote for Willkie , he will not tangle with the New Dealers if he can help it . Says he : " What 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody is on edge ? "
