For many months OEEC ( Organization for European Economic Cooperation ) has struggled to find some basis for a " master plan " leading to economic integration of Europe . Under such a plan , imports , exports , currency exchange , allotment of manufactures , purchases of raw materials , etc .. would be geared together . But the conflict of economic philosophies and , especially , nationalism made any actual formulation of a plan seem remote . Last week , at a meeting near Paris of OEEC 's eight-nation steering committee , the plan was abandoned . <P> Said OEEC 's secretary general , Robert Marjolin of France : " It would be a vain task to attempt to write a new long-term program . . . until such time as the participating countries make certain fundamental political-economic changes . . . When these adjustments are made . . . without doubt we shall again decide to project in figures this mutuality of national policies ... To do it now would be pointless labor . . . " <P> Thus was written off-or indefinitely postponed-what many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid to Western Europe . The OEEC turned its back on European integration to face a less important but more urgent task : how to become independent of U.S. aid by 1952 . <P> The Extravagant Wife . Sir Stafford Cripps , Britain 's brilliant economic boss , was on hand for the OEEC talks . The U.S. Marshall Planners had told the European nations to get their financial houses in order , and Britain , once threatened with collapse , had done this better than any other . For this success , Sir Stafford praised his own brand of austerity , a controlled system of trade which combined high exports with low imports of consumer goods . <P> The continentals were not convinced that " austerity " would take root on the mainland . Led by France 's Robert Schuman , they made it clear that they favored a softer way of life ( sometimes called " Beneluxury " because the Benelux countries , particularly Belgium , like it so much ) , with a high volume of more or less free European trade in all directions and relatively heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observer explained , " took the line of the husband whose wife is spending too much money , and who favors a reduction in her allowance . Schuman took the line that the husband should earn more money . " <P> The Prudent Husband . Britain is now trying to buy most of what she needs from the sterling areas . She has reduced her dollar imports by 25% ; the other major OEEC nations by only 15%. * Last week Cripps proposed that the others should make a further reduction of 10% to match Britain . At this point ECA 's Averell Harriman , who had been itching to join the discussions , was invited in , and promptly threw his weight with the continental high-volume traders . <P> The final result was that each nation agreed to cut its dollar imports further , but would judge for itself how much to cut . This was billed as a compromise , but actually it was a victory for Cripps . For the next year or two , OEEC would let each nation seek recovery in its own way ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national self-sufficiency . That was what Cripps , the prudent husband , had been plugging for all along . <P>
