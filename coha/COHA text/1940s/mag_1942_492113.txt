THIS was the third day of the war . The third day of our war . Dawn was sliding over the eastern ridges into the great central valley of Luzon when the Clark Field siren wailed . The bombers were coming ! That warning stopped work around the shadowy bulk parked at the edge of the field . A motor whined and the bomb-bay doors swung closed . The bomb train , still laden , trundled away . Someone said , " Well , three 's better than none . " There were shouts , blue tongues of flame cut the half light , and four more engines joined the cacophony rising from the field . The Fortress wheeled slowly out toward the runway . " Mission : Reconnaissance north of Aparri ... report disposition of enemy naval forces before attacking . . . " The navigator clipped the tissue to the bulkhead and bent over his map table . Behind the pilots , the flight engineer braced himself and watched his instruments as the big ship gathered speed . The thunder of the four engines flattened out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the radio operator reported quietly : " Off at five four seven . " Beside him , the two gunners unhooked their safety belts and catfooted back toward the Brownings in the blisters . In the plexiglass nose the bombardier uncovered the bomb sight at his feet . In the cockpit the copilot , peering out , made a thumbs-up gesture as the right wheel plunked into its well . The pilot eased the throttles . They were in the clear now , with the gray ground mist smoking below them . The navigator switched on his interphone and waited . The gunners were reporting At Stations . Then he said : " Compass heading , twenty-two . Correction after I get the drift . " The bombardier studied the pattern of his bomb-release rack . Just three packages this time . If they 'd only yiverc us fifteen minutes more . The port gunner sighted them first . They were ten miles abeam , steaming toward the shadowy coast line the Fortress had dropped behind twenty minutes ago . From 23,000 feet they looked like pencil marks trailing feathery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his microphone . The Fortress banked and straightened . From the nose the bombardier 's voice took command : " Five ; one big baby . Two destroyers and two cargo . One 's a tanker , maybe . We 'll take the big feller . Make your run diagonally from astern . " From the cockpit came the warning , " Watch for their air support . " The gunners rubbed their cold hands and bent to the guns . The flight engineer inched his way into the seat in the top blister . In the nose behind the bombardier , the navigator racked his protractor and took his place at the gun . Radio was repeating : " . . sighted ten zero three , heading southwest , acknowledge . " The bombardier studied the dark lines on the sea . They were clearer now , taking size and shape . The big one was Kongo class . She was beginning a zigzag . He glanced at his instruments . Twenty-three thousand on the nose . Speed , two zero five . The ship gave a sudden lurch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the bomb sight . Ahead and just above them flowered a white rose . Another lurch and the sound of rending metal . The bombardier spoke into his microphone , " Left one thirty degrees . . level off . . five right . . . ten left . , . P.D.I. " His left hand strayed up to the toggle switch on the bomb release and rested there . The pilot could n't see the smoke rose or the ships or the sea . He was watching his flight instruments and the pilot directional indicator controlled by the bombardier below . He was holding the big plane on the track as the load went down . The ack-ack was giving them a rough ride now . The copilot , kneeling on his seat , grabbed a support as the last 1000-pounder dropped from the bomb bay . " All gone now , " came the report from the nose . Only the bombardier saw the load land . He counted the hits  --  one , two , three . One direct and two near-misses . He saw the mushroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final shattering explosion as the ship heeled over on her side .

When we recognized that the obscure problem was to build a Diesel engine as the Diesel itself would like to be built , without regard to other types , we developed a high-speed lightweight engine that was an immediate success . We are now supplying thousands of these new Diesels for tanks , landing boats , submarines , and a hundred other military uses . If we had accepted the criticisms of the " experts " before we started our work , we should not now have this product ready for the Army and the Navy . The " experts " were right when they criticized the old Diesel . Its uses were few . The new Diesel simply changed the facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them will agree that we have made the advantages of the Diesel available for other purposes . We must never lose sight of the constructive value of criticism , however . Let 's not become criticizers of the critics . Our job is solely to put the available facts into the critics ' hands , so that they can see what our problems are and why we are doing what we are doing about them . We do n't want to lose the benefits of critical thinking . If everyone was satisfied with everything in the world , progress would stop dead today . When people begin to be completely satisfied with what they have , the concrete is beginning to set in their heads . One of the research man 's jobs is to keep people reasonably dissatisfied by showing them how much easier and pleasanter life can be than it is . There is only one danger in criticism that I think we ought to guard against . We must not allow criticism of one phase of a development to upset us so completely that we throw out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-duty lubricant thought they were safe when the bomb-pocked field unfolded 7000 feet below . The flight engineer , from his post in the top blister , saw them first . " Six fighters coming at us astern ! " The big ship wheeled on its side and dropped away in a twisting dive . One . lap came in and missed and swung away . Another slipped into the starboard gunner 's field of fire and zoomed up to safety . The third caught them in the middle , lacing bullet holes down the long fuselage , into the top blister and pulverizing the instrument panel . The fourth caught No. 4 engine . There was a burst of smoke , and red banners of flame streamed out behind . The attackers floated away , dodging the ground fire from below . The pilot gave the order , and the living left , one by one , reluctantly but without hesitation . And then , with the six white chutes dropping slowly toward the green land below , the pilot fought his way out of the flaming ship . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as he jumped .

The fate of the six others who teamed with their leader and their flight engineer to make aerial history  --  for this is the first known instance of a which was such a great improvement over previous oils that it increased the life of a bearing from 1000 to 100,000 miles in certain types of service . With a gain like that you would think we would be rushed off our feet by people trying to take it away from us . But what do you think happened ? When we tried to give it to one of the big oil companies , they were n't interested at all . And why was that ? They did n't like the color ! Years ago I knew a fellow whose job it was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After he had been there a week or so , everything would be running smoothly again . He was such a successful trouble shooter that one day a fellow asked him what he did . " The only thing I do , " he said , " is keep everybody away from the boys and give them a chance to get at the job . They know what needs to be done . " We have a large job ahead of us . Everyone , including the critics , is going to have to do his part . It is an entirely new job , and we are bound to run into difficulties from time to time . We know that every new job is accompanied by problems , so we do not allow them to worry us too much . If we all work together , we shall be able to solve them as we go along . There is no substitute for facts . If we all know what the available facts are , we shall be able to put our minds and energies together for the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the highest sort . It takes teamwork to put a man out at first base , and it takes teamwork to produce airplanes and tanks . We even have our critics in the bleachers . But the job we have to do is a much more serious affair than the ' World Series . Let 's leave the critics in the bleachers , but let 's keep the players on the field . single bombing plane sinking a major fleet unit  --  have been submerged in the stern necessities of war . At this writing , Washington does not even know their names . It does know , however , that they worked together to do a job , and did that job without counting the cost . Fighting in already obsolescent equipment  --  an early-model Flying Fortress without a " sting in its tail " ? they demonstrated a technique of aerial fighting which has completely revised the training policies of our Air Force . In Washington , in the Air Corps training centers and in the striking units of the Combat Command , the magic formula is known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words and see how they have changed the character of America 's preparations for war in the air . During the 30 's the U. S. Army Air Forces  --  then the Army Air Corps  --  were old hat and perilously close to becoming old-school tie . Public indifference , internecine squabbling among the political divisions of the War Department , and an ancient jealousy between the Services over their respective spheres of activity all contributed to an alarming lag in the development of aerial fighting equipment . With the exception of long-range bombardment craft  --  pushed hard by a bomber-minded air staff and produced by the designers and manufacturers responsible for the world 's finest civil-airtransport system  --  we were two years behind the best that Europe had to offer when 1940 rolled around . If the lack of combat performance  --  chiefly in fire power , speed and armor  --  of our fighting planes was sugar-coated with weasel-worded references to quality during those years , the same can not be said of the men who flew those planes . In the matter of schooling its pilots the Air Corps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of appropriations , the Air Corps lavished all its enthusiasm and energy on the relative handful of pilots its expense account allowed . The result was a sort of select seminary of the air in which the entrance requirements were as stiff as the training standards  --  and these for years were stage-managed to keep each class to a pre-established maximum . The result of this was a closed corporation ; a system which reached its apogee with the establishment of two ratings  --  a command pilot , who had to have 3000 hours in the air and fifteen years of flying service , and a senior pilot , who had to possess a minimum of ten years of flying service . Thousands upon thousands of alert , healthy young Americans who could n't meet the lofty educational requirements or who suffered from a lack of curvature of the metatarsal arch were never given a chance to prove that they could be pilots and officers and gentlemen , and the few who did unconsciously perpetuated an illusion which almost caught us with our landing gears down . We 'll examine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picture in 1939 , when a quarter of the Luftwaffe blasted enough holes in Poland 's defense for ten Wehrntachts to walk through . America was not prepared in the air , but until that devastating illustration of air power 's striking potentiality , we 'd had nothing to prepare for . The fault must be laid at the door of circumstance . And , for once , we opened the door the first time necessity knocked . Poland turned our eyes toward air power ; the conquest of the Lowlands and France by the Nazi air and land forces operating as a team started us to work . No new broom swept Washington clean , but a good deal of dust was shaken off the existing organization . Two capable , aggressive and nonpolitical Assistant Secretaries were appointed to direct the Army and Navy air programs , the Air Corps was made the Air Force  --  Air Corps plus the Combat Command  --  and given a loose autonomy within the Army organization , and , best of all , manufacturers began to receive orders for more than fifty planes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high gear , is one of the brightest pages of American military and industrial history . It still left , however , one big problem  --  we had to find and train the men to man the planes . And this introduces the great illusion . The Empire Training Plan Until December seventh about all we knew was that we would have to fight the Axis in the air . When and where and under what circumstances were questions no one could answer . And so the problem of personnel was answered by cutting larger and larger slices off the same old side of beef . To all but a few of the far-seeing , pilots and planes still added up to an air striking force . True enough , a bombing plane needed a trained crew , but we could siphon bombardiers , gunners , radio operators and engineers from our technical training schools for enlistedpersonnel , as we had always done . So the pilot-training program was upped from five to twelve to thirty thousand plus . And then reports began to filter back from the Battle over Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , through bad navigation , had never found their targets , and happier evidence of repeated German failure in large-scale raids because untrained bombardment crews had n't worked together . Suddenly deserting the policy of building its air force around the old-school tie  --  and this with all glory to the thin red line of public-school men who saved Britain with their Spitfires in the fall of ' 40 ? Britain swung into the Empire Training Plan , which emphasized quantity production of entire plane crews and simply let fighter pilots grow as the flowers in spring . Offensive war in the air had suddenly become a complicated business revolving around highly trained and co-ordinated flying teams of from three to nine specialists  --  often several teams to an airplane . And where were we , with our armada of planes and our thousands of pilots coming up ? The - Army of the Air For a while , on December seventh , it looked as though we were out on a limb . Pearl Harbor was a platter which handed us a two-front war with both fronts thousands of miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That meant big bombers and trained crews . And suddenly the War Department found that , while the pilots were in the making , the rest of the crews were going to be harder to get in quantity lots . The average American youngster able to meet the Air Corps requirements wanted to be a pilot . This was not snobbery , but simply the realism of a generation raised in the Lone Eagle tradition . Why be an " also-ran , " a name in a logbook , when you might become a pilot with silver wings doing the real job and earning your commission and kudos ? Faced with that misconception and the consequent threat of a famine in skilled man power , the War Department climbed back off the limb in the early weeks of this year and brought with it the plans for a brand-new air force , 1942 style . New entrance requirements , new training practices and a revised conception of the job to be done have all been welded together to form a framework upon which will be built an air force of 2,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and RAF  --  and you-can-guesshow-many planes . This design for the mass production of air power is now being translated into reality . Let 's see how it works . The Air Staff 's first precedent-breaking step was a revision of the requirements for all aviation cadets . Minimum age was dropped from twenty to eighteen , with the maximum remaining at twenty-six , all formal educational requirements were thrown out the window , and the ranks were opened to any married man who could prove that his wife could support herself . The physical standards were left unchanged , but Air Corps medicos now waive many a small imperfection they would have pounced on before . With this new lake of man power dammed up and waiting to be tapped , the Air Force looked around for the best possible method by which it could get the right men in the right places . It looked long and hard at the Empire Training Plan and came forth with a modified version of that organization . The aviation-cadet training program is the Air Force 's answer to the need for precision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on voluntary enlistment  --  first take the general physical test given all Air Force officer candidates . Those who fail take the Air Corps exam for enlisted personnel and , if they pass , are moved into technical training schools where they learn to be gunners or ground-force specialists . The happy majority who pass the first test next face an examination of 150 questions and problems designed to test their ( 1 ) quickness in comprehending instructions and accuracy in following instructions , ( 2 ) ability to read intelligently and understand what is read , ( 3 ) skill and accuracy in fundamental mathematics , ( 4 ) mechanical comprehension , ( 5 ) general judgment , and ( 6 ) their understanding and evaluation of current events . This test is of the multiple-choice type , with no premium being placed on speed . An intelligent youngster who never finished high school has just as much chance as a Ph.D . Here are a few of the official sample questions , just to give you an idea . You 'll find the correct answers in Keeping Posted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he is to A  --  widen it . B ? strengthen it . C ? destroy it . D  --  close it . E ? replace it . If a hangar which is known to be 30 feet high casts a 20-foot shadow , what is the height of a signal tower which casts a 70-foot shadow at the same time of day ? A-46 ? a , feet . B-140 feet . C-210 feet . D-23 ! 3 feet . E-105 feet . Ten trucks are transporting road-building material across country . The leader comes to a fifty-foot stretch of ice-covered hill which is so steep and slippery that his truck will not pull it . The most practical thing to do in these circumstances would he to A  --  tie all the trucks together , so that the first could be pushed up the hill , the last pulled up . B  --  turn back and wait for warmer weather . C  --  put the drivers to work building a temporary road around the hill . D  --  have the trucks back up and take a running start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work scattering some sand from one of the trucks onto the ice . Which one of the following is an adaptation of a slogan which was popular in the United States during the Spanish-American War ? A ? " Thumbs Up " B ? " Remember Pearl Harbor " C ? " Time is Short " D ? " We Do Our Part " E ? " Keep ' Em Flying " Applicants who fail this quiz are given an opportunity to enter the Air Corps ' technical training schools ; the lucky ones who manage a passing grade are sent to three great classification centers  --  at Maxwell Field , Alabama ; Kelly Field , Texas ; and Santa Ana , California  --  where they are given another and more rigid physical exam to see if they are qualified for air-crew training . Once more , a failure reroutes the candidate to a technical school , while the physically qualified remain as air-crew candidates under the Air Corps Training Command . Here are evident two great differences between the new and the old training plans . The first is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they get them . A failure any place along the line merely means that the applicant is directed through some other and less demanding type of schooling . But once he 's Air Force , he stays Air Force , whether he ends up as a member of an air crew , a mechanic on the line or a hangar cowboy . A second difference is that the Army now decides who 's going to do what ; until he 's passed all his tests and safely ensconced in the classification center , the candidate is simply an aviation cadet . And that , as we have seen , covers a multitude of jobs . It is in the classification center that the air-crew hopeful first meets the inscrutable It which will shape his immediate destiny ; It is the psychologists ' gift to the Air Forces . They 're called classification tests and they measure , in divers ways , the aptitudes and psychological equipment of young men who will , a few months later , be dropping death on Jan cruisers and Nazi tank columns . If you wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section of an official memo given air-crew candidates before they start the tests . This section deals with the navigator : " The extensive bombing experience of the present war has made clear the extremely difficult and important task of the navigator . . . . If the navigator fails to plot a true course or if he can not find the target in enemy territory , he and the entire bomber crew have made a useless flight and risked their lives and equipment to no avail . Even more , failure of the mission may have serious military consequences . " Although the percentage of planes which do not reach their target as a result of faulty navigation is a military secret , foreign governments have found that it is so large that the selection and training of navigatora has become one of the major problems of the bombardment-aviation program . The navigator must be a man skilled in making rapid calculations and applying mathematics , and apt in the use of complicated instruments . . . The navigator , more than any other member of the air crew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion for accuracy and the power of logical reasoning under conditions requiring speed , coolness and precision . " This same pamphlet says of the pilot that he " . . . must have a particularly fine sense of orientation , good muscular co-ordination and a spirit of co-operation . " And of the bombardier , The military value of a bombing plane is no greater than the ability of its bombardier to place his bombs on the target . With the improvement of antiaircraft fire and of combat planes the bombardier 's task has become more and more difficult . He must bomb from very high altitudes or from very low altitudes . Under the former condition the greatest accuracy is required , while under the latter great speed is essential . The bombardier must have the best of vision to pick out histarget from great height , he must have fine muscle co-ordination to make delicate adjustments on the bomb sight and he must remain calm and steady under combat conditions . The navigator , pilot and gunner may do their jobs to perfection , but if the bombs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission has failed . " And so the training plan 's insistence on precision teamwork begins to take form and cogency . During his stay at the classification center the air-crew candidate not only plays his grim game with It but also earns a uniform and learns some of the fundamental facts about being a soldier . When he leaves he 's either an embryo pilot , navigator or bombardier and already developing the esprit de corps of his group . After a further nine weeks in an initial training center the three groups split and follow their respective training courses in specialized schools . When they meet again , each air-crew member will be wearing Air Force wings , with the rank , pay and allowances of a second lieutenant . A bonus of $500 is added for each year of continuous active duty . And thus the aviation-cadet training program scores its third important point ? hy giving all air-crew members the rank and the pay they deserve . While air-crew students are streaming through the fifteen navigation , the twelve bombardment and the eighty flying schools , radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight engineers will be receiving instruction at the thirty-two technical schools scattered around the country . And now let 's take an over-all look at the picture . On one hand we have the bombers  --  and remember again that these are our main offensive weapons in a global war  --  rolling out from the network of factories already dotting the country . On the other we have an army of specialists marching forth each month from the air-crew and technical schools . Thousands of them  --  each one trained to do one job and do that superlatively well . Navigators know how to get from here to there  --  and " there " is wherever someone puts a pencil point on a map  --  no matter what the weather . Gunners know windage and trajectories and machine guns and aerial cannon . Bombers know ballistics , the private life of their bomb sight and the ticklish spots on every Jap or Nazi man-of-war . Flight engineers can read a symphonic score from every revolution of a Fortress ' four engines . Pilots can dead-center a ripple at 30,000 feet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have controls with which to fly them . Radio operators can repair their equipment blindfolded . They 're all good . That 's easy for Americans , who grew up with the stuff . They 're good , but they 're still not combat crews . They 're still just parts of a machine that now has to be put together on the assembly line . MacDill Field , in Florida , is one of those lines . Barksdale , in Louisiana , is another . And there will be others before we 're through . At MacDill you 'll hear the phrase " 0 . T. U. , " which is Air Force euphony for that assembly line . An operational training unit knits the individual specialists together so that they form a combat team , and pours that team into the airplane with such painstaking care that every left hand knows what every right hand is doing every minute of flight . Then , and not until then , you have an element of an aerial striking force . The bars are bright , the sergeants smart and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pilots and copilots , with a patch of four-engine training behind them , know the ships they 're going to fly , but the other crew members often have their eyes opened wide when they 're introduced to one of the Big B 's . There is just seventy-three feet , nine inches between the nose and the tail of a B-17E , the Flying Fortress , and a good part of that is tough crawling . Add to this the fact that the bombardier and navigator are a " floor " below the pilot 's cockpit and that the radio operator and three of the gunners are separated from the control cabin by a narrow catwalk through the bomb bay , and you 'll understand why each member of the crew of nine must know how to do his job without benefit of on-the-spot conferences . An interphone system connects the crew members , but in combat this must be reserved for fire-control direction and the bombardier 's instructions to the pilots . Another lesson each member of the team learns on his early flights is that high-altitude work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't be wasted in crawling about in search of advice on what to do next . With the individual crew members sold on the necessity of precision teamwork , MacDill takes its first important step in the job of knitting the crews together . Nine men  --  one for each post in a Big B  --  are tolled off and designated as a team . From then on they play and work together as a unit . Athletics , briefing sessions , lectures and flying missions all find the nine aerial musketeers together . By the time the training period is over , the boys know what makes each of the others tick , and they work together like the members of a major-league infield . Never again will the Air Force have to send out green combat crews  --  as it did on one occasion at the start of the war . On its first long flight together that crew left Florida and landed finally in  --  Australia . Six weeks of operational training is planned before these combat crews are turned over to active fighting units . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Navigation , Bombing , Aerial Gunnery , Instrument Flying , Night Flying , High-Altitude Operation , Bomb-Sight Operation , Photography and Radio Communication  --  with emphasis , wherever possible , on the crew 's precision teamwork . During this period each crew member learns something about the other fellow 's job , so that he can take over in case of injury during combat . Adjustments are made within each team , so that the gunner with the strongest stomach finds himself in the tail and a navigator with a quick trigger finger is teamed in the nose with the bombardier who needs time to lay his eggs . Gunnery is co-ordinated , with each of the three " professional " gunners directed by the engineer from the fire-control turret  --  this so that each attacker will be picked up and passed along  --  if he 's not dropped by the first burst  --  from one gun to another as he slides through their respective areas of defense . The Bomber Command staff grins now when it gets reports such as : " . . . Fortress , bombing Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down six of them . The plane , with two motors shot out and 1200 bullet holes , was brought safely back to home base , " They grin because they have an idea the Big B 's can be made completely invulnerable to fighter attack , and they 're out to prove it . Precision teamwork is the answer . And it 's going to take a lot of heroes to make it work .
