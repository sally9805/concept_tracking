 | A couple of weeks ago , on a train between New York and Chicago , the pretty young girl who shared the coach seat with me suddenly burst into tears . I have reached the age when I can not easily imagine why anyone young and pretty should burst into tears . However , she believed she was on the spot marked with an X. In Chicago she and her soldier bridegroom were going to see his family , whom she never had laid eyes on . More than anything on earth , she wanted to make a good impression on that family , and she was scared she would n't . There was no sensible reason for her feeling afraid ? she looked like the kind of daughter-in-law any family would welcome ? but she behaved as if she were about to visit a bunch of sharp-eyed , long-toothed orangutans . Orangutan fever , more commonly known as in-law fright , is all too prevalent , especially these days when a ' lot of young couples marry in haste and away from the home circle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has turned into a pale-faced , jumpy mumbler who puts her worst foot forward with every step she takes , numbs herself with aspirin , and clutches her young husband 's arm in a death grip . Moreover , he usually can not understand why she should be so nervous about meeting such swell people as Mom and Dad . If you are about to meet your in-laws , your heart pounding , your face wreathed in a ghastly smile , here are a few pointers that may be helpful to you . Unless you and your husband married against the express wishes of his family , in an atmosphere of parental thunder and lightning , they want very much to like you . Obviously , they do n't care to believe their precious son had no more sense than to pick out , as his bride , some fiend in human form . They like to think he is smart enough to choose a first-class girl . So , because of their pride and love for their son , they are eager to think well of you . Confidentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . Your in-laws are worrying just as much about the impression they will make on you as you are worrying about your effect on them . They 're saying anxiously , " I hope she likes us . " Dad is wondering if he should wear his new suit , and probably Mom is cleaning the house from top to bottom . It 's silly to be scared of people who doubtless are preparing for you as if you were visiting royalty . When you ring their front doorbell , have a proper sense of your own value . Know that you 're worth having as a daughter-in-law or your husband never would have wanted you as a wife . Do n't be humble and fawning . But do n't think too much of yourself , either . Wear nice clothes , but do n't dress up like a plush horse , or your in-laws may wonder if you are the sort of glamour puss who cares for nothing but clothes and could n't possibly live on your husband 's income . Soft-pedal your expensive tastes . When you talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impression you expect your husband to shower you with mink coats . And while we 're on the subject of clothes , another word of caution . If your in-laws dress simply , keep elab-orate @#  | clothes , if any , packed away . Do n't dress so that you look conspicuous in their circle . Fit in . Suppose your background is different from your husband 's . Minimize the difference . For instance , if you 're a city gal and your in-laws live in the country , do n't behave as though the country were a quaint sort of place . If they have dinner at noon and you 're used to dinner at night , do n't mention it . Be sure to be on time for breakfast . And do n't act like a guest . If there 's housework to be done , pitch in and help . Do n't brag about your accomplishments . You can trust your proud husband to do that . Watch your step if you 're a career girl holding down a job . Let your in-laws know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Be prepared for the fact that in-laws are far more interested in your attitude toward their pride-and-joy than in any work you do , so do n't tell them details of your job that may fascinate you but leave them cold . Show your love for your husband . You do n't need to be sloppy , but you can reveal the fact that you think he 's the grandest thing on two feet . As they think so , too , you and they will get on like two houses afire , blazing merrily . However , in showing your love , do n't appear possessive , as if your husband were your sole property . Remember he " belonged " to them before he " belonged " to you . Do n't show your power over him by asking him to run upstairs and fetch you something every five minutes , and do n't walk around with your arm linked in his as if you had him in handcuffs . If your mother-in-law acts possessive toward your husband , do n't resent it . Be understanding , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her boy is a married man . Encourage your in-laws to talk about your husband 's childhood , because that 's what they really want most to talk about . The time he had the croup or fell out of the apple tree . Do n't be bored if your mother-in-law brings cm ; family photograph album and goes it with you , picture by picture . T1 that album represents many 1 anxious years . If your in-laws ask tions about your own childhood , think they 're being nosy . It 's only ural they should want to know all can about you . If your family is higher financial bracket , do n't stre fact . If your family is not overly b with worldly goods , be frank about not apologetic . Do n't he afraid to act a bit shy . in-laws will like that trait in yo cause brides are supposed to b Alas , so many brides are afraid shy that they go to the opposite e. and act brazen . They 're so alarm ( they wo n't seem free and easy tit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bride who , though naturally silent , prattled and babbled to 1 laws for hours , out of sheer nerve until they believed she was sot of human phonograph . Be careful not to give the iml that you and your husband are 1 a future that does n't include his Tell them how much you want visit you in your new home , a you expect to keep in close tou them . Ask their advice about y ( niture and your budget and wi husband likes to eat . Just so the feel they 're being left out in thi Let your husband have sot alone ' with his family , No mai much he loves you , there are t might want to say to them w are n't around . And they surely talk to him alone , as they did 1 was married . So do n't always k those present , But do n't say , w ous tact , " I know you people h to say to one another .
