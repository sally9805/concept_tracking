In the Carnegie Hall bar and Joe Romano 's Restaurant around the corner , many an oldtimer with a battered fiddle case shook his head sadly over his beer . Summer was over for the Philharmonic orchestra ; it had been about as quiet as a monsoon . The open-air season at Manhattan 's Lewisohn Stadium had piled up the largest deficit in the orchestra 's 25-year history , most of which is written in red ink . Dimmed out as an air-raid precaution , the outdoor stadium had been plagued nightly by the whir of airplane motors . A bolt of lightning had demolished the sound shell on the stadium stage . The final concert had ended in a steady drizzle of rain , with seven violinists sadly sticking to their posts and moistly fiddling Auld Lang Syne . There was not a dry aisle in the amphitheater . <P> No sooner had the stadium season reached this amphibious end than General Manager Arthur Judson announced a shake-up among the Philharmonic 's most important and highest-paid wind players .

Massive Flutist John Amans , famed for his ability to make his tootling instrument boom like a church organ , was retired , replaced by the NBC Orchestra 's Pennsylvania-born John Wummer . World 's champion French Horn Player Bruno Jaenicke , suffering from a heart ailment , prepared to spend the rest of his career sitting on the sidelines while a younger man , Rudolph Puletz Jr. , did most of his puffing for him . <P> Most radical change in the Philharmonic 's ranks , the engagement of a new first trombonist named William Jack Satterfield , caused heated comment not only among Carnegie Hall 's long hairs but throughout the music marts of Broadway 's dance-band industry . No highbrow , Trombonist Satterfield , son of a West-Virginia farmer , is famed , not for symphonic and operatic tromboning , but for his hot riffs as a member of Raymond Paige 's " Young Americans " and several well-known U.S. dance bands . Never before ( except in the case of one obscure drum &; cymbal player ) had the august Philharmonic unbent its classical dignity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
