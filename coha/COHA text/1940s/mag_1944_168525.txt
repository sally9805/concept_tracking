Canada has no single composite character like the U.S. 's " John Q. Public . " The Dominion 's " average man " is really two men : English-speaking " Jack " and French-speaking " Jacques . " Last week a summary of all Canadian Gallup Polls taken up to Aug. 16 , 1943 ( since Dec. 2 , 1941 ) compared Jack 's thinking on major issues to Jacques ' . * Result was probably the clearest short delineation of Canada 's dual character yet published . Sample comparisons : <P> The War . Both Jack and Jacques are confident of victory , think Germany is the No. 1 enemy . But both have difficulty finishing the sentence : " Canada is fighting this war because . . . " Jack favors compulsory savings to put the war on a pay-as-you-go basis , but Jacques , being a voluble foe of anything remotely like compulsion , does not . Isolationist Jacques , unlike Jack , thinks Canada 's armed forces should be kept at home , for defense . <P> Domestic Affairs . Neither votes as regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago wanted diplomatic relations with Vichy France severed , but Jacques thinks the ties should have been maintained . Catholic Jacques thinks divorce is too easy , while Protestant Jack feels that the law is too strict . <P> Postwar . Both yearn avidly for social reforms ( their primary goal : job security ) . But Jacques wants these things achieved through private enterprise , Jack favors Government controls . <P> Jack wants to see the Dominion 's population swelled through immigration ; Jacques would close the door . Jack hopes Canada will remain an integral part of the British Empire . Jacques would prefer to be a citizen of an independent nation . <P> * A booklet : Jack &; Jaques ( Ryerson Press ; 50 ) .
