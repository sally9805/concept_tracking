 | Liesbet and Gerrit roughly out of the room and down the long passage , where the maids and stable hands joined in pushing them into the east wing . They had to hurry , Katrien thought excitedly , for in another moment father gnome and his children would break the door down , and if they found the newlyweds ' quarters empty , they would flee and never return , mortally insulted . And the marriage would end in catastrophe . In her zeal Katrien catapulted herself into the east wing with Liesbet and Gerrit . And only when Gerrit kept looking at her sheepishly , did she realize her error : " Watch out , Trien , or the sprites will marry you off to Gerrit , and then what would I do with the baby ! " Liesbet shouted , shoving her back into the arms of the maids , who received her with loud shouts of merriment . " But I 've got to see what happens , " she cried , struggling . " Why I have to , or But they only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Gerrit . " That 's no place for you , youngster , " a hefty scullery maid told her firmly . " Not yet , I hope . " It brought her to her senses a little . Through a hall window she now watched father gnome and his children demolish the evil broom on the threshold . Now all the remaining evil spirits were supposed to be crowding into the house , and father gnome and his brood followed and set upon them at once , singing the incantation , sweeping and cleaning as they went . Moente touched Katrien 's shoulder . " Come with me , " he said . " I 'll show you . " Through a dark narrow passage he led her into a dark scullery , which had a little curtained service window opening into the room where the gnomes now had entered and were advancing toward the cowering couple in the corner . Liesbet , now that she was n't aware of spectators , seemed to enter into the part fully , while Gerrit , of course , had been terrified from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Katrien , " if the gnomes see you , the game is all up . You see they 're already looking for any sign of an insult . "  | She bobbed her head . She knew . The climax was now at hand . It seemed she could hardly breathe . She clamped her hand desperately around Moente 's wrist and watched . Half of the gnome brood seized the screaming Liesbet and carried her to a table on one side of the room ; the other half , whacking and torturing Gerrit unmercifully , dragged him to the other side . " What are they doing to him ? What are they telling him ? " Katrien whispered . " It 's just as well you do n't know , " Moente smiled . Then father gnome walked to the table on which the bride had been placed , and , raising his hand , called for silence . Meanwhile , Gerrit was still putting up his expected struggle to reach his bride , rather lamely , Katrien thought . Father gnome , however , ignored him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was bidden to open at once . Every straw that she dropped was immediately picked up and carried away by his solemnly silent brood . At last Liesbet had undone all the wrapping and extracted the naked little doll inside , a crude wooden thing with yellow hair and vermilion cheeks , and kissed it . Immediately father gnome bowed to this symbol of fertility , and ordered his brood to follow his example . But all his brood stepped back and pointed accusing fingers at Gerrit , uttering moans of despair . Father gnome now turned and also looked at the guilty bridegroom . So he had n't fought his way to aid his bride ! There he was , still on the opposite side of the room . He had disgraced her ! Father gnome raised his hand for silence again . " The bridegroom has been tardy , " he bellowed . " We have been insulted , and all our work , has come to naught . Come , let us flee from this house , let us hide our shame deep in the woods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great mortification , he bowed low and started slinking toward the door . His brood followed him , wailing , turning to point accusing fingers at the bridegroom .  | And so they filed out , and scattered over the yard , and disappeared , leaving only their echoing cries behind them . " Now you can relax , " Moente said almost seriously , looking at Katrien 's trancelike face . " Just look . " He pointed into the room again , where Liesbet and Gerrit had started tidying their rumpled clothes . Through the door , friends and relatives now poured in upon them . " See , " he added , when Vogeltje and Farmer Oosterveert came hurrying in . " Come on , let 's hurry , " Katrien whispered . But then she stopped , amazed . And Moente said : " Well , you could knock me over with a feather . " There , coming through the door , was Mevrouw flaming , her arm hooked through Vogeltje 's mother 's , who with might and main seemed trying to unlimber a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Oh , Omoe can do anything , " Katrien said proudly , as if Moente himself was not her son . But now that the last remaining gnome had disappeared , the guests began pouring out into the yard . They were all now supposedly abandoned to the devil , so must fittingly indulge in wild and raucous revelry . Attracted by the sudden hubbub , Katrien ran out into the yard , where someone pushed a tankard of beer into her hand . She drank it down , imitating a man beside her . Then someone gave her gin . She drank that , too , coughing . Music started up , flags were raised , glasses tinkled . This was joyous bedlam , but they all knew it would be of short duration . Soon father gnome and his brood would return and avenge themselves . Close watch was being kept from every corner , on every dike , ditch , moat , and bridge . In a great dither , Katrien started looking for a hiding place like the other guests , because if any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merciless treatment . It was n't till that moment that she realized she belonged with the immediate family in the east wing . And there they were already starting to barricade the door . Panic-  | stricken , she rushed for the door , hurling herself across the barricade , and into Moente 's arms : " Girl , " he warned her , " if your Omoe saw you now , she 'd send you to bed to get calmed down . It 's lucky for you that she 's so busy acting out this reconciliation stuff with the old virago . Women certainly arc won-derful ! " " I 've had two drinks , " she confessed irrelevantly . " Hmn . I think I 'd better keep a closer watch on you , " he chuckled . " Uncle Moente , " she said suddenly , seeing him as a wonderfully wise and considerate man , " later I want to talk to you very seriously . I thought I 'd wait till Ernst came home , but it may be too late then , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether to take her seriously . But at that moment the gnomes descended upon the house . They wreaked havoc now on everything they encountered , and every victim they caught they relieved of his trousers and pushed into the moat . They laid siege to the east wing , throwing dirt over the doors and windows , undoing all their previous cleaning . Everybody in the house now set up a great commotion , and Katrien , forgetting her tragic pose , entered into the game at once . With other guests , she rushed to the windows and shook her fists , pretending with them to be defending the house valiantly . At last Moente pushed Gerrit through the door carrying a broom with a white flag , and very reluctantly father gnome concluded peace with him . Then father gnome opened the door , and in a loud voice he read off a long list of Gerrit 's sins and shortcomings , especially those which would be of great detriment to him in the bridal bed . Mevrouw Haming forgot her duties toward Vogeltje 's mother for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the girl stood there enthralled . Finally father gnome made the groom promise never to  | forsake his bride , never to forget to sustain her and comfort her , never to let his ardor slacken . Then at last he accepted the white flag . And immediately all the gnomes stripped themselves of their fantastic garb , and from vengeful sprites , they turned into kindly household spirits who at once started setting up tables all over the yard , and pouring drinks . Only one part of the ritual still remained to be performed before anyone was allowed to take a drink . Gerrit was sent to place a dish of porridge in the center of the manure pile , as a peace offering to the real gnomes and earth spirits whom they all had impersonated . Now Gerrit and Liesbet were at last wedded . The day waxed full and noisy . Almost dazedly Katrien slumped down in her chair beside Liesbet at the head of the table . Liesbet was ten times more collected than she was . Katrien looked at her in mute amazement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but his hands seemed to be quite uncertain . And there beside each other , like two incongruously friendly birds , sat Omoe and the old woman , still very ostentatiously reconciled . All around the guests were feasting : glasses clinked and voices swelled up . Then Katrien saw Moente 's eyes looking for Vogeltje . And when he saw her , his knife slipped off the ham , and he smiled at her , an uneasy , boyish smile . And she lowered her eyes and blushed , and then her smile came at last , wrinkled and scalloped , but real , remaining on her face , a moon 's smile on an unmoonlike face . Katrien , seeing it , hugged herself , closing within her the secret of what she had seen . It made her feel very warm and melting . But of course , she thought romantically , abstractly drinking Liesbet 's very strong glass of brandy , of course , they love each other . Everybody loves somebody very much , but she . . . Why should n't she ? Why not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table outdoors , beneath the very great blue sky . Somehow it did n't seem important here to collect her thoughts through a wide and beautiful haze of five hundred different sensations.  | And through it all she thought wistfully of her German boy friend . So wistfully that it seemed strange she 'd never seen him as so desirable before . What had she been drinking , wine or brandy or both ? Whatever it was , Hans was handsome and clean and even compelling , there in a new , swimming vision . " I 'm going to have a wedding just like this , " she said solemnly to Liesbet . " Have it here , " Liesbet said . " I 'm afraid he might not be able to come here , " she answered , peering through a lavender mist . Finding her grandmother 's gray eyes fixed upon her , she caught them with her own eyes and clung to them . But she lost them again . Then she found the eyes of a young fellow upon her . He was tow-haired , awkward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his collar . He had nice eyes , like a deep spot of blue ocean on a map . He was Gerrit 's brother , she recognized . And he had a good complexion , and good humor sat upon his features like a halo . She loved him very much . No , she could love him very much , if it were n't for Hans . She felt lost , and then suddenly and unreasonably very lonely . She looked up at the great sky , at the clouds shaping and reshaping themselves . It would be better if she immersed herself swiftly once more in all this feasting . Around her now the sounds of merriment were far , low , cornered , as if they came from a conchshell . " I could be so awfully happy , " she confided to Liesbet , tearfully . Liesbet looked at her and felt a strange maternal pity for her . She was so young , so unsophisticated , so irresponsible . Protectively she put her arm around Katrien 's shoulder . " When it comes like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or hear , " she murmured consolingly into Katrien 's ear , amazed at her own words , " well , it 's because you 're still so young and fresh and free . It seems so long ago I was ... "  | Then Katrien laughed , bell-like . Her grandmother looked up and chuckled at her . She 'd dropped through the clouds down to earth again . And it was a wild earth , noisy and pungent with smells and sounds . Uncle Moente handed her a large slice of ham on the end of a fork . For hours he 'd been carving ham , she thought . She looked for Gerrit 's brother again . Finding him , she smiled at him , but he blushed , and tried to duck his neck down inside his stiff collar . When at last he looked back at her again , smiling with an anxious-to-please effort , she saw him as her German boy . " Darling , " she said under her breath . But somehow she could n't bring herself to tell Liesbet about Hans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , closing her eyes to picture him more clearly .  | CHAPTER VII DIRKIE WAS TAKING A WALK , PLEASED , preoccupied , slow . A bird in a tree across the canal piped an incredible variety of sounds down upon him . It made him feel important and somewhat alone , but when the bird was suddenly silent , he shivered from sheer delight . He walked on as if he had left his real body far behind and walked in spirit only , as happened in that book Father was reading aloud to Mother . He did n't understand much of that book , but he felt it like curtains lifting and footsteps rustling away , and everybody going to a dark castle which stood against an orange moon . And , of course , that was the real reason he was on his way now to the ramparts and the old tower , to experience again what he felt when his father read to his mother from that book . Father had a wonderful voice that made you expect things to come at you around corners . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invisible flitting beings , hinting at almost impossible wickedness . Dirkie had to walk more slowly , to examine his own thoughts . Now should he cross that bridge he was coming to , or should n't he ? Should he look at it from below or from the same level , or stand on it and gaze at the water ? Why could n't he do all those things at once , and experience all their pleasures at once ? Why , could n't he , like a spirit ? He pushed his red stocking cap , prickly in this summer heat , higher upon his short cropped hair . Two men at a butcher 's shop I07  | laughed at him . But he did n't see them and he did n't see the butchery . Father was going away again , day after tomorrow , so Father and Mother had gone out together early this morning to see a great deal of each other  --  which they could n't do in the house , it seemed . So their bicycles were gone when he 'd waked up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cap , but in a box he 'd found his red winter cap full of mothballs . He 'd put it on his head to wear it to the tower . Absent-mindedly he had shared his breakfast with the kitten , the new monkey from South America , and two of the parrots . Ghosts followed him out of the house , jocular ghosts like fat fishermen , but they only gave further impetus to his trancelike assignation : to find the castle in front of the moon from the book his father had been reading . Later , he 'd go to see his grandmother , who was just back from Cousin Liesbet 's wedding . And yes , he 'd call on the Abrahams ' later , too . He wanted to see that bright yellow tiger . And Mevrouw Abrahams would feed him babbelaars and duimpjes , they were sweet and wonderful . The yellow tiger was in an old book , a marvelous picture , but most of the time Mijnheer Abrahams could n't find it .. . A milkman with his dogcart came up the bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might and main to restrain the three big dogs pulling the cart . But they 'd seen a ginger cat who was making a wonderful getaway over trellises and fences . Dirkie was so intent on the cat that the milkman had to snatch him out of the path of the cart . He started scolding him , but when the boy only smiled in return , he lifted him into the cart and let him ride for a block . It was a pleasant interlude for Dirkie , but not long or important enough to interrupt his dreamlike itinerary . It had brought him closer to the ramparts , however . " Danko , " he said suavely to the milkman and headed for the rampart steps at once , bending low , because suddenly he was an old man burdened with grief . And grief was a burlap sack full of peet and coke , and it was dirty and  | heavy . He wiped his brow . Your grief like your sins you had to drop at the foot of the cross , the minister had said last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midst of a clean , salt-smelling wind he dropped his grief and stood up straight . He could imagine a cross there , because the preacher had said you had to believe in a cross or perish . Still , the Abrahams ' did n't . And they had n't perished . He must ask Mijnheer Abrahams all about it . With his grief gone , Dirkie watched the gulls and pigeons . The wind was making billows on the grain where the sea used to be . The wind evidently had forgotten . It was also a little like millions of butterflies flying up and settling . But the sun did that . Between the fields of golden grain the deep water bosoms lay dark blue and silent . Up in the sky thunderclouds mounted , one upon another , trying to reach God . But they were still silent . When God touched them they 'd find voice . Now they simply yearned , unspeakably . The blue water bosoms yearned too , but they yearned for deep silences beneath the earth . Dirkie , too , started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . He could n't imagine beyond that . " When deep calls to deep , " he whispered . There were children playing on the ramparts , some flying kites , some merely shouting . He was n't concerned with them . He was now a pilgrim only concerned with his pilgrimage . And then , there far below him , in the midst of the smoky yellowbrick huddle that was back-harbor town , he spied Vladimir among his brown eel nets and brown baskets . Vladimir whom some people called Vlam . " Vlam , " Dirkie said , half aloud , half to himself . Calling a man a flame was strange , especially so subdued and smoky a man as Vladimir Goessen . That fascinated him . He decided to climb down the ramparts and go through the gate and call on the man . His pilgrimage to eternity was finished . A man who was called flame had captured all his future aims .  | " Hi , Dirkie , Dirkie , " three ragamuffin boys shouted after him . " I 'm busy now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark arch , he felt a little beset by all the mustiness and age of the ramparts . He emerged into the sunlight and sniffed at the salty air with pleasure . He started singing a little , too , unconsciously echoing the song of three cyclers going down the old harbor road . He remembered the cyclers three minutes later . He took the prickly red cap from his head and pushed it down inside his shirt front . Ensconced in the wheat sea sat the green island like a green peacock . Nesting . He imagined a bridge above him , curving like a rainbow from the ramparts to the island . Ile imagined himself walking on it . But if he did he would n't be able to reach Vladimir . Of course , he might drop and plummet down , spread his wings and soar like a tern . . . . Reality was n't nearly as real as these forages into his own imagination . But somehow , steadily , he made his way toward Vladimir 's sheds , and that in spite of the many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , angles , gables and roofs of backharbor town he had had to examine . This was really like a jungle or a labyrinth in which all the details demanded his attention . Still , because he had to follow one purpose , he had no right to cast his eyes everywhere . So much piled up inside him that it was like turning the pages of a book too fast , so that you could only read little passages . He was quite surprised when in the end he suddenly came upon Vladimir . Vladimir was oiling a pair of very high , very large hip boots . Silently he hunched down beside the silent man , watching the movement of the strong , oily hands  --  like little leathery animals themselves  --  over the great expanse of boots . Dirkie gazed up at the solemn man 's face , seeking out the deep-set eyes . " Vlam , " he said tentatively ; then , too late , tried to hold the name back . Supposing you called a man a flame and he flared up like a flame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said calmly , his voice kind and warm . It made you feel as if you 'd stroked a big animal , say a horse . Of course , now he 'd have to make conversation . But in no hurry , Dirkie hunched a little lower , a little closer . " Vlam , " he asked seriously , " is that hard work ? And does that keep them from getting hard ? " " Why , yes , my boy , " the man said , letting his hand lie still a little while . " And you are Vrouw Haming 's grandson , are n't you ? " " Oh , yes , " Dirkie said proudly . " Oh , yes , indeed . " Vladimir chuckled a little , two hard chuckles like little lumps of clay thrown against a board fence . Dirkie liked that chuckle , but it certainly was n't like any flame . Vladimir started rubbing one boot again . Gravely Dirkie got to his feet and measured himself beside the second boot . It was as tall as he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was extremely heavy . Boots so big terrified him a little . With his eyes he measured the man 's long legs , the broad shoulders in the pomponed jersey . A bigger man than Father , he was , and the short mustache beneath his nose was red . Perhaps that was the reason he was called Vlam . But he was Vrouw Goessen 's son , and she had said that Vlam had surrendered himself to the devil and ingratitude . " Are n't you a long way from home ? " the silent man asked suddenly . Dirkie felt guilty because he 'd just stood there staring ; it was n't polite . " Oh , yes , " he said hastily , " but nobody minds . " " No ? " Vlam asked a bit skeptically . " No ? " " No , " Dirkie answered firmly , " because everybody knows I 'll be all right . " Vlam smiled a little and patted Dirkie 's shoulder protectively , shaking his head slowly as if in deep contemplation . As if he felt sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hastily : " But , Vlam , if you put on those heavy boots and you 're out there eel fishing ,  | and your boat should tip over , you 'd never get to the surface again . You 'd drown , would n't you , Vlam ? " The man looked at him silently , and his hand lay still on the oily boot . Vlam 's eyes seemed to be tunneling into him , Dirkie thought , but then they seemed to retreat the way little crabs and snails did into their shells . " Yes , I guess I would , " Vladimir said at last . But then his eyes and voice seemed far away , so Dirkie looked around him and saw a fisherman sitting on the next dock , across the jetty . The fisherman just sat there smoking and looking at the sky . But Vlam had n't resumed rubbing his boots . His hand still rested like a small mountain on the oily rag . Dirkie became a little afraid . " But you wo n't fall in , will you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head slowly but did n't answer . " Of course you wo n't , " Dirkic answered for him with an old man 's inflection . " Of course you wo n't . " At last Vlam looked at him again , piercingly , as if he saw the insides of him . Instinctively Dirkic looked at himself , too , to see if his heart and inmost thoughts were exposed . Because God saw them , too , and ? " You 're a funny little fellow . " Vladimir then said slowly . " But maybe you should go home . Maybe you 've been away a long time . " Affectionately he reached out to pinch Dirkie 's cheek , but , seeing his oily hand , he stopped . " Now you 'd better hurry home , boy . " " Yes , " Dirkie said gravely . But as he turned , he looked back once more with misgiving at those heavy boots . Then he looked at the fisherman on the other side of the jetty . And then , too , he saw Vlam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fished for eels . Dirkie decided it was time to leave . " Well , good afternoon then , Vlam , " he said very urbanely and a little pompously . It seemed to stir Vladimir from his trance . " Good day , little fellow , " he said . Reluctantly Dirkie walked away . He stared vindictively at the fisherman , who had n't moved one inch . Maybe he could n't  | move . Maybe he always sat there , like a statue , with the gray ramparts for background and the funny cathedral tower in the distance . Once more Dirkie looked back at Vladimir , who was now placing one boot beside the other , precisely , as if he intended to step into them from a high place . But when Vladimir looked at him , Dirkie hurried on , afraid that he 'd be rebuked for being so slow . He intended to go straight home , but the strange old neighborhood demanded too much of his attention . He looked a long time at a flacon with golden seaplants which were supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He sat on someone 's stoop watching a cat eat a fish . Then he realized it was the stoop of a saloon because two men came stumbling out and , seeing him , became sentimental and each gave him a penny . A little farther along a man with a glass eye sat playing an accordion . The music made Dirkie feel sad , especially when he discovered in the gable opposite him a woman 's face of stone and the woman was sticking out her tongue . A sparrow landed on the tongue , but at that moment an old fishwife came past and wanted to know whose little boy he was . He stared at her in great disgust . " I 'm not a little boy , " he answered . Then somehow as he walked over the cobbles , those boots of Viam 's came back to his mind . Also the man 's faraway look . Those thoughts gnawed at him like mice . And so thinking , he had somehow gone back through the rampart gate , and then he found himself upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candy which he had bought with one of his pennies . . . All grownups acted strange , he decided . Then more violent and arresting than the gnawing of his thoughts , came the gnawing of his hunger . Perhaps Father and Mother would be back . He looked at the tower clock . Past noon . It amazed him . But he had also planned to call on the Abrahams ' . He decided to circle the rampart moat where last week he had seen one rat chase another through the green water  | scum . That way he would reach the Abrahams ' house through the little red arch with the stone goat above it . But he saw no rats and he forgot to look up at the stone goat as he hurried through the arch . His hunger was now piling up inside of him like a heap of jagged stones ; he felt utterly exhausted by the time he reached the Abrahams ' house . To old Mevrouw Abrahams who opened the door , and who gazed down on him with soft , sentimental eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry I ca n't walk anymore , Vrouw Abrahams . " " You poor lamb , " she cried , grabbing his hand and pulling him inside , after peering vindictively down the street as if she 'd spotted there the enemy who had made her poor lamb so hungry . " You come right with me into the kitchen . " The house was full of great food odors  --  odors of meats , fruits , spices : Dirkic 's heart melted in him . He cuddled closer to the old Jewess , his very teeth seeming to float with hunger now . " Does n't anybody look after you any more ? Not anybody ? " the old lady cried . " No , " he said sadly . " No , Tantc Rachel . " " Och , och , " she lamented , " Och , my little David , now . My little David . " Now everything was all right , Dirkie knew . When they called him little David , they were full of love and pity for him . And he called her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good and kind . Not like Rachel in the Bible who was young and always going to the well carrying a crock and who was jealous . In the kitchen they came upon Mijnheer Abrahams . The old man 's face lighted up when he saw Dirkie : " Well , well , well , " he mumbled through his beard . " The little lamb , he 's starving , " his wife cried . " Well now , well now , " the old man mumbled , shaking his head in sympathy . " Our little David . How are you , child ? " " Starving , thank you , Mijnheer Abrahams , " Dirkie said with sad dignity . Together the old couple hoisted him on to a chair  | in front of the table , as if he had no strength of his own . They put a plate before him and piled food on it . Afterwards he could n't remember how long he had stayed with them . But he had been comforted and surfeited with food and attention . He had rewarded them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone with Mijnheer Abrahams to the front room , where they had pulled a brown curtain aside with the tinkling of brass rings , exposing many fat leather and parchment-covered books which had only numbers on their covers or strange Hebrew letters . And there he and Mijnheer Abrahams had searched for the book which had the yellow tiger in it . It had taken them a long time to find it , because Mijnheer Abrahams would sit down in the middle of the search and start reading . He 'd even put on his black skull cap and glasses , and Tante Rachel had come in bringing them tea , followed by the cat . And still they had n't found the yellow tiger . But Dirkie was always patient . Then the doorbell jangled and Mevrouw Abrahams waddled out to answer it . She called her husband , and there were voices in the hall , people talking in Jewish voices . Then Mijnheer Abrahams came back to pick up his glasses , and he was saying excitedly : " It is war ! It is war ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper , and then hurried out of the room again . At that very moment Dirkie found the picture with the yellow tiger . It was almost as if he 'd gone through a deep and mysterious jungle to find that tiger . Now the picture , garish and melodramatic , showing the huge yellow beast leaping over very high , very green grasses at a little brown man , seemed like a great prize . Only distantly , beyond the periphery of his consciousness , did he hear the voices of the older people . Then the doorbell jangled again , and there were other voices . There were also high voices in the street , and feet went pounding by . In the back of the house he heard people talking excitedly . They  | talked about Germany and Poland . . . . And there was war , Dirkie realized with a shock . He saw smoke and pillage and dead bodies . Hastily he closed his book and put it back on the shelf and pulled the little curtain to . He walked to the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peering at a newspaper , from which one of the men was trying to read aloud , but was constantly interrupted . Tante Rachel was wringing her hands . He had intended telling her that he was going home now , but , seeing how upset they all were , he slipped quietly out of the house . In the street he came to a stop . The narrow , high-gabled houses stood there as if nothing had happened . This was war and yet the houses slept upon their own shadows , and the sky with its threatening thunderclouds was silent . There was no wailing , no tread of marching feet . No people ran from the houses , no one cried out to him . He was puzzled , and yes , disappointed . He decided to ask his grandmother about it , and headed for the Court Without A Name . When he turned the corner into the court , however , he stood astonished . Many people had come out of their houses there and stood talking . And Vrouw Goessen was there , wailing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women were trying to calm her . Then Dirkie walked slowly toward a very large group of people who were crowded around a man . Dirkie saw that it was the fisherman he had seen on the dock near Vlam . And the fisherman was saying : " Yes , yes , I saw it with my own eyes . And he had those hip boots on , and we saw the boat capsize , I do n't know why it did , but he went over and never cried out . He sank like a millstone and was gone . And when we got there he was still under . And when we went after him with grappling hooks , we got him to the surface at last . But I tell you he 's dead . He 's dead . They can work over him all they want .... "  | " Sunk like a millstone , " an old woman wailed . " And you say he 's dead ? " " Of course , he 's dead , " the fisherman protested grimly . " No man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And with those heavy boots on , that 's why he sank , that 's why . . . . " Dirkie pushed against a woman 's skirts , trying to wedge through . But this was war , too , he thought confusedly . And he again caught the name of Vladimir , and he remembered how Vrouw Goessen had looked , crazy , with her hair loose over her shoulders . And still he did n't know exactly . He tugged at the woman 's arm . " Who is it ? " he cried . " Vladimir , " the woman said , hardly seeing him . " Sank with his boots on . And they say he did it on purpose , they say ? " but she turned away from him , to listen to the fisherman again . " And I told him ! " Dirkie wailed suddenly . " I told him ! " He clasped his hand over his mouth and backed away . But nobody seemed to have noticed him . He remained standing there with his hand over his mouth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd sink with those boots on , and Vlam had gone and done it . Terror seemed to be closing his throat . Then he could n't believe it , and he started running , sobbing a little , toward the ramparts . Ahead of him Vrouw Goessen was also running , with the three women who still were trying to console her . On top of the ramparts he stood in a group of people , who peered over the sea of grain . Vrouw Goessen was now shrieking : " They 've murdered him ! They 've done it , my son ! " But she hated him , Dirkie had to tell himself , as if that wiped out his guilt for having told Vladimir about those boots . " See the ambulance ? " somebody said , and then he , too , saw the white ambulance winding its way through the wheat toward the margin of the widest bosom , toward the huddle of people bending over Vladimir 's body there . He wanted to run out there  | himself , but two policemen were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rampart with all the people there . Then he saw Vrouw Goessen on the other side of the ramparts , shrieking wildly at the policemen . They let her through then , and she started running , her hair flying wild , her arms waving . But he kept his eyes miserably riveted on that little black group beyond the yellow wheat . He heard the people murmuring around him . " There are three men working over him , " one woman said . " It wo n't do a bit of good , " another answered with grim conviction . And lie could hear voices whispering inside of him besides : " You told him he would drown , and he did . You told him .... " Never , never would he be able to tell anybody again that they would die . Miserably he listened to the voices around him , clinging to one shred of hope then , something about a machine to make drowned people breathe again that a city woman was telling a fishwife , who contradicted her violently . Then the fishwife shouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him back to life , he 'll be worse than dead . Worse than dead . A man who lifts his own hand against himself .... " Dirkie could stand it no longer . Ile had to get away . Blindly he stumbled through the people , then down the steps of the rampart , not looking back . Then over a bridge , riding into the city , but not in the direction of home , he saw his father and mother on their bicycles . Futilely he cried out to them , but , of course , they could n't hear him . Now there was only Omoe left , but he did n't dare go through the court again . Now he knew : Vladimir was dead and worse than dead , and he had told him . Hurrying through Widows Court , he came upon a group of people . He was going to run past them , thinking they were talking about Vladimir , but they were talking about Germany and Poland , excitedly . But , of course , this was war , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her shop . Instead Aunt Gezina was sitting behind the counter with an open letter in her lap . But  | he did not want to speak to her , so he decided to slip past her , and go up the back stairway , because Omoe must be sleeping . She must be still tired from her trip to Liesbet 's wedding . Tante Gezina did not see him . She was reading a letter from Renzel for the fifth time . Seventeen people had come into the store to tell her that Germany was invading Poland , and what they expected England and France to do in turn . And here was Renzel 's letter . Logically there was no connection between it and the war , but emotionally there was . If war came here , Renzel would be one of the first who 'd have to go . He 'd be one of the first to die .... When the door had opened and she 'd seen it was Dirkie , she had simply turned back to her letter and her fear . Now she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps she 's awake now . " " Yes , " he said hardly above his breath , afraid that she 'd detain him . But her eyes were on the letter again . Softly he pushed the door open and peered diffidently at the closed flowered curtains of Grandmother 's bed . Her slippers were standing neatly in front of the little stepladder . But there was no sound in the room . Tiptoeing up the little ladder , he parted the curtains and peered inside the dark bed , smelling the cheeses . Then he saw the bedcovers stir and he felt Omoe 's hand upon his head . " Oh , Omoe , " he said softly . " Dirkie , did you come to call me ? " " No , Omoe , " he said , suddenly realizing that he did n't know how he could tell her about Vladimir . " No , I just came to see . " She pushed the curtains aside to look at him better . " Yes . Well , I 'm through sleeping , I 'm getting up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way for her . He stood in the center of the room watching her push the covers aside , then sit there awhile in her white nightgown and nightcap . She looked sleepy , and a little comical , too . It seemed very hard  | to carry on a serious conversation with her like this , though now the questions were burning at the tip of his tongue . At last she put her feet over the edge , bare feet . He 'd never seen her bare feet before . They embarrassed him , and he wondered if he ought to turn his face away . But she kept sitting there , dangling her feet and smiling down on him . " You 're a mighty lovely sight , Dirkie , " she was saying . " You ought always to be here when a body wakes up . " He felt oddly inarticulate . And then suddenly he saw that there was a considerable distance between her dangling feet and the top of the little ladder . Suddenly the words were out of him : " Omoe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break your neck ! " Horrified at his words , he clamped his hand over his mouth . Again he 'd made a suggestion inviting death . But she simply sat there , Laughing at him . " Why , of course . I 'd fall to pieces lilac an old alarm clock . And no doctor or carpenter would be able to patch me up again . " " Do n't , " he cried , horrified . " Do n't , Omoe , because Vlam " But at that moment the door burst open and Grandfather came marching in , swinging his cane dramatically . Grandfather came to a stop midway between them , and he said sonorously : " The hour has come . The great hour . It is war . And are we prepared ? Are we ? No ! " " What are you talking about ? " Grandmother demanded impatiently , still sitting there dangling her feet . " It is war , " he shouted . " War . While you lie there sleeping , and the whole country is sleeping , war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he pushed the little ladder away with his cane , and stood threateningly in front of her , as if he dared her to jump down . Terrified , Dirkie jumped forward and grabbed the little ladder . " No , Omoe , Omoe ! " he cried . " Do n't you fall now , do n't you do it ! "  | Amazed , Mevrouw Haming looked from her husband to her grandchild . The man with his operatic gestures and the child with his genuine terror . " What 's going on here ? " she said grimly . " What has happened to everybody ? " " War ! War ! " her husband shouted , wagging his cane at her . " Where ? " she asked brusquely . " Germany and Poland , the whole world ? " " Calm yourself , " she said . " Calm yourself , man . " And then she looked down on Dirkie , still guarding the ladder anxiously . The old man shouted almost hysterically and marched out of the room . " You sleeping ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " Slowly she lowered her feet toward the little ladder , firmly the boy held on , his breath caught in the back of his mouth , his face rigid . Only when she was safely on the floor did he let go . Seeing his terror , she put her arms around him , and he sobbed : " Because I told Vladimir , too , and he is worse than dead . Because then I told you about the stepladder and " She choked his voice away against her nightdress . " Now , now , now , my little Dirkie . Child , what has happened ? Tell your Omoe . " But he could n't say anything . She 'd never be able to understand this . Never . Somehow grown people could n't , or would n't . I This was an awful day , and maybe tomorrow . . . He sobbed disconsolately , not daring to open his mouth now for fear he might suggest something else that would bring tragedy . She led him to a chair and made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . War had come , but the child had said something about Vladimir Goessen . She had slept deeply , and these rumors of terror piling into her waking moments did n't seem real . It seemed they would have to pass away . She did n't even know now how to console the boy . Then there were swift steps on the stairs ; Katrien 's . The girl burst into the room crying excitedly : " Grandmother , there  | is war , and everybody is excited . And they say Vladimir Goessen tried to drown himself , but they say ? " She stopped , puzzled at Dirkie 's horrified expression . Then she went on : " And Mother just had a telegram from Oporto , from Ernst , and he says he 's coming home . " Then more slowly , still watching Dirkie , who had turned very pale , she added : " And she also had a letter from Renzel , but that just was n't connected with the war . " She stared with frank concern at Dirkie now , and pointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Dirkie ? " Dirkie , bursting into outright tears , ran for the door . He only stopped to sob : " Because he 's worse than dead ! Because I told him ! Because ? " but he suddenly broke off , and they heard him running down the stairs . They both stood there staring helplessly at each other . " It seems , " Mevrouw Haming finally said , " that the boy knows too much , and I altogether too little . What did you say about Vladimir 's drowning ? " " But lie did n't drown , " Katrien protested . " They finally brought him to , but they say lie tried to drown himself . " " Then I do n't understand anything , " the old lady said grimly . " Then I do n't understand at all . "  | CHAPTER V111 WHEN IT WAS DONE IT SHOULD BE completely over . Then you could pull a curtain over it and steer your course forward again . Now she must be still asleep , sprawled across the bed , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up but had failed and fallen back . Over her chair would be hanging the blue silk , too-tight underwear . Beneath her drooping hands with their carmine nails was the impossible rug , a tawdry convoluted world converging upon a central yellowbeaked peacock . On the fat , dachshund-legged dresser , he could still picture the glasses , empty . And the perpetual flies near . And the roaches rustling from the washstand behind the loose flap of wallpaper . And always the outside noises gathering momentum toward nothing vital , and subsiding in the same manner . She 'd sleep many more hours . She 'd be too drowsy to understand and cry out afterwards . Dazed she 'd stare out at the red scalloped roof tops , at the walls upon which cats sunned themselves . And so it was over ; what he had started as a necessary adventure , a recognizable one . Now after this , other doors of life could be opened . You looked far ahead , clearly , because you were Ernst Haming . Now from the blistered boat rail you saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away toward the vineyards behind it , having decided to sleep there forever more . Then against the water 's edge lay Vianna ; their next stop would be Santander ; then they 'd cross the rest of the Bay of  | Biscay to St. Nazaire ; then Brest , Dieppe , Rotterdam . It was good to know that , precisely . The ports were necessary little goal posts to which you 'd attach minor importances and from which you 'd gather minute assurances . Oblivion would fall over them later , like snow , obliterating . He tried not to be heavyhearted , or remorseful . He tried to minimize this Oporto episode as a minor sort of disturbance . Comfort lay in looking at the direct path ahead . One muddled because one did n't have himself in hand ; it was n't wise and it was n't economical . And yet , he knew he was still floundering . The safe haven of normalcy was still lying far ahead . All because of a Portuguese woman called Mercedes , from whom he had escaped by feeding her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously Dutch woman who had circled around him , posting herself at the rail , twice to his right , once to his left , now started pointing a camera toward shore , directly into the sun , and in an **38;488;TOOLONG ' voice cried : " I want to be sure and get the Portuguese shore , not the Spanish . " " That 's Spain , " he answered , pointing at a cobalt headland ahead upon which houses rested like scattered confetti . " Oh , I 'm so grateful . " But he was gone when she looked up . She pouted a little . The only Hollander among the eleven passengers , and he . . . She left her thoughts unfinished on the ascent of her disappointment and chagrin . A capable-looking fellow , flawless , undeviating eyes , strong hands . She closed her camera . . . . Ernst strolled on toward the stern of the boat and leaned against the rail . The woman would keep circling the deck , meeting him , strewing her need for male help before her like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a husband so obviously in the offing that she need n't wear that wedding ring . The husband was there like an invisible host , omnipresent in her dress , her bearing , her voice .  | Still , he had been uncivil . And that was always uncalled for . It was indicative of his state of mind . It proved again that he had been submerged in unknown depths and had been afraid . He 'd felt uncertainties creeping , clinging to him ; in the black depths he 'd seen incomprehensibles shaking , like cilia , obscenely and maliciously . That was the increased and magnified aftermath of those moments of terror that time he 'd almost drowned . When he was sixteen . Was that concrete terror going to spawn others , at unexpected times ? His actions had always been determined by what he ought to do , clearly . Even as a boy . He had never allowed himself to have patience with uncertain gropers , like his brother Renzel , for instance . And when he had envied Renzel 's surrender to doubts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cardinal sin . As he grew older he felt more and more that he had to live up to what the majority of his friends expected of him . He had become the farsighted , but practical young engineer . His friends and father had expected just that . Hence his friendships became means of proving himself to himself . Action produced subsequent action . Hence you charted your own course far ahead . You sinned and you feasted according to schedule , so that you did n't need to waste time or energy on remorse or doubt . The pattern became simple , easy to follow once you saw it and adopted it . Yet , somehow  --  very infrequently , of course  --  he seemed to tumble into those unchartable depths . Then it was your duty to recognize your own panic as soon as possible . " Immediately relax , straighten your arms and your legs , and you 'll shoot to the surface . " Those had been his father 's instructions , preparing him for the emergency . But to those he had had to add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you felt panic . And never examine that panic . Cover it up , let scar tissue of strength grow over it . Ignore it . Now the blue sea started to soothe him . The green and fox-  | brown Cezanne shore seemed to show logic and precision ; the great sky , justification . He was strong and healthy . He was a little shorter than Renzel , but harder , and filled out where a man ought to be filled out . Like his eyes , his jaw seemed to look far ahead . The rich , smooth skin over his bones seemed like a hallmark of confidence . He was darker than Renzel , in a more positive , affirmative way . He looked eight years older , ten times more pleasant , a hundred times more competent . His browned hands upon the blistered rail seemed to impart strength to the rusted iron . Men had faith in him ; for his own sake he could n't let them down . Women lowered themselves before him ; for their own sake he treated them civilly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . He 'd had enough of the sky , the ocean , and the shore . He went to his cabin , hooking the brass hook of the door behind him . IIe stretched on his bed , to let his thoughts come horizontally , to gain better control of himself . Then he got up again to remove his coat ; he detested wrinkled clothes . He took off his freshly polished black shoes ; they might soil the counterpane . He hated dirt . Hence he could almost hold that dirty , wobbly room in Oporto responsible for what had happened . That room  --  even the view from it seemed wobbly , and the ceiling evanescent and fragile  --  almost justified his misdeed . Or was simple expediency ever a misdeed ? Never , he wanted to answer himself firmly . He leaned on his elbow and poured himself a brandy in the thick tumbler . He 'd wash the taste of Portuguese wine out of his mouth , forever . " I 'm sorry , but I have to leave you , " a voice seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm sorry , but good night and sweet dreams , " came the echo . And then it was as if the curtains had been pushed aside entirely , and the vertical-sounding voice started speaking to his horizontal self : " Because you could say , Good night and sweet dreams , ' in  | Dutch , to a dark-skinned Portuguese girl who could n't hear you . Whom you 'd never see again . Good night and sweet dreams . ' Because she would n't wake up for hours . " How had he walked from that hotel ? Like a man , all the voices of his pride wanted to say in unison . " Yes . " But it was a filthy room , he argued , with rustlings of chestnut-brown cockroaches every time you walked , and when you rinsed her glass the last time , and when you put the rest of the sleeping pills in your own vest pocket , and when you opened her imitation pigskin purse and pushed the bank notes into them  --  not too many , because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to opulence anyway  --  and when you 'd fixed the latch on the door , the final action , before you went out . At each act the cockroaches had rustled out , to act as witnesses , and then had scurried away again , as if to record the deed . That was six o'clock this very morning . The Olympus had sailed at seven . In that hour he had collected his own things . Yesterday he had booked passage . " You , Ernst , look ahead too knowingly . As if everything is an architectural plan . You do n't seem to realize that in shadows there is more peace and beauty . " Grandmother naming had said that on a rare occasion of flowery speech . The trouble is , he said to himself , I have a conscience . And yet . And above that . And notwithstanding . " And in spite of all your preparations you lost yourself , " the voice beyond the curtains said , hurrying closer . " At some point you turned a corner , went up an unknown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is peace and beauty . You never learned . The terror that came then , remember ? " Yes , something , somewhere along the way , had gone wrong . Was it he himself , or circumstances , or God ? Leave God out of this , he decided grimly . Unlike Renzel he was a steady churchgoer , unlike Renzel he did reckon with God . It gave direction to life . But leave God out of this . God had n't been in the deep water either , that time he 'd almost drowned . If you went deep enough  | below the surface where everything was hideously dark , where no sane life could be , there God could n't be either . Hence hell was separation from God . Because God is life . My life ... . He took another drink , his fourth . On most occasions he disapproved of drinking : disliked the blurring distortions that came from alcohol . " First of all , I 'm an engineer . But in the second place , I must drink this sweet aftertaste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the pendulum would swing back to precision . He should n't have taken this boat , which forced upon him these idle hours . Any activity would have been better ; if woven into actions , past events became simple memories . Then there would be no dangerous tentacles reaching into hidden crevices . But there was a Providence , and there was a plan to the universe . Germany had invaded Poland . That great event had shaken him back to his senses again . It had told him first that it was his duty to go home immediately . It revealed the next page he had to turn . So the next step had presented itself at once . He had wired his mother that he was coming home . Then he 'd found the Olympus and had booked passage . Then he 'd settled his accounts . The final desperate account : that evening he 'd taken Mercedes to that awful little hotel , where they were n't known  --  at least where he was n't known  --  and there he had drugged her . Because somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave her . So he 'd given her the sleeping potion , she and her three knives . When she woke up she could brandish them , and all her dramatics , before whatever spectators she could find . Was n't it the best way out ? It was like this . He was twenty-eight . He always hid diligently what was no one 's concern but his own . He had the reputation of knowing how to handle women , of making easy conquests . Why should he deny it ? Or admit that above everything else he wanted to keep himself free from any entanglements . Stay inviolable . Because he did n't trust himself ; because  | he did n't know when he 'd plunge , or . . . . Well , that was his own concern . He had liked Oporto , and his work there . But he had anticipated liking it , almost exactly to the degree that he did . He had again found friends who kept their own lives free as he did , who seemed friends on parallel lines with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mercedes , on their sort of terms . He had no recollection that he had been intrigued by her at first . Later she had suited his plans . Later , when the engineering project was finished , and his friends had gone back to Holland . So that there would be no witnesses , if . . . . But there had been no " if . " Coolly , to the best of his ability , he had planned the liaison : one which promised the fewest possible entanglements , and would last for only a week or ten days . The plan had come to him one evening , whole . His thoughts had fastened themselves at once on Mercedes . Like Melchizedek in the Bible she seemed without forbear or kin ; there for his purpose . This , he had decided , was going to be a necessary milestone to pass . To be passed , understood , and then forgotten . He was n't seducing anyone , nor fooling himself . She was n't a conquest , she was more like a partner . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Largely , he supposed , because one 's own desires and the desires of the one you became involved with behaved like tropical weeds , growing rankly and intertwining . Had he fallen in love with her ? Impossible . Had she with him ? Perhaps , judging by her actions . But there had been so few understandable words between them . He knew very little Portuguese ; she ten words of Dutch , perhaps fifty of English . Like birds they had twittered the few necessary elementary sounds sufficient for their needs . But somewhere he had lost sight of the end . On the fourth day he had realized that it was no longer there , not the simple and recognizable end . He had waked up to that startling realization . He 'd  | lighted a cigarette , watching her lying there beside him , sleeping . Looking at her neck , he 'd thought " In another year she 'll broaden and coarsen mightily . I ought to hate her , but because she 's so incidental I need n't . And she ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , because Because the evening before she had let him know unmistakably , in fewer than those sixty polyglot words they understood between them , that she knew he intended leaving her the next week . But why not ? Why had she expected anything else ? But she 'd sobbed , unconsolably , making herself ugly , sitting there with the unclasped knife in her lap , blubbering , in German of all languages : " Ernst , Ich liebe dich . Ich liebe dich . " " Put away that foolish knife , " he 'd said , truculently . But she 'd gotten up slowly , and , delving into that imitation pigskin bag of hers , she 'd come back with two more knives , opening them . Then , pointing to the three knives in her lap , she 'd said : " Three , see ? " It was ridiculous . And who had told her that he was going away ? And why had n't he chucked it all that evening , the three knives and all the tears notwithstanding ? Portuguese girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . But he had stayed , consoling her , feeling himself sinking . And the next day he 'd realized it fully . His own emotions had then risen against his own sense of rightness and had delivered him into the enemy 's camp . Why , and how ? There was no answer ; and there had been no end to it then . Then three days later , while he had been fairly walking on stilts of misgivings , Germany had invaded Poland . And the way out had presented itself . It was a signpost . After that he 'd simply started to act  --  simply straightened his arms and legs as his father had instructed him . One act had led to another difficult act ; he had even been able to fool her into thinking that now he was n't going to leave her , now that he had settled with her in the filthy little hotel . And now ? Now you had to blot all that away . Take another  | drink , because you are alone with yourself , and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself ... It was all clear now . Just for a moment , like letters written on a blackboard . He saw now that it was all rooted in that time he 'd almost drowned . He was only sixteen then . He had been with his father and Mathijs van Amsdel , who was now his uncle . Somehow he had tumbled off the high pier into the churning , forty-foot-deep water . He knew when he went down that he was lost forever . But it was n't that only ; it was more the terror of the blackness , the hostile nothingness , with his own body somersaulting through it , there where there was no God and no help . Then in the midst of everything had come the memory of his father 's voice , the command . Immediately he had relaxed , and he 'd pivoted back to the surface , and they 'd grabbed him . And at that very moment he 'd chained his horrible fear tightly inside of himself . " If he had n't such a cool head , he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 'd smiled at his father , because they expected him to be brave , composed . But he 'd vowed never to allow himself to get beyond his depth again . Then .... Oh , if I could sleep now , he pleaded with himself . A moment later he did fall asleep . The bell did n't awaken him . He had no interest in dinner . Blotted out was Mercedes , also sleeping , in that tawdry hotel . He woke up in the middle of the night , and immediately he remembered the sinking of the Athenia . His head was pressed tightly against the wall . There was a hard pain at the roots of his hair ; a hard fear now pressing upward , at the memory of the Athenia . His cabin seemed to be shaking strangely . Intermittently it quivered . An oddly insistent din came from the water pitcher . He lay very still , to let his fears pass , trying to get hold of his fugitive senses . Then he jumped out of bed , reeled , steadied himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why ,  | in the pitch black of the night , with two stars close together outside his porthole , two stars bobbing between funnels of clouds ? And the Athenia had sunk . And this was war , unrestricted warfare  --  this . He got control of himself by realizing he had gone to sleep with his clothes on . That angered him . You must n't do that again , he said to himself severely . Then he made himself lie down again , listening to the nonhurried water sounds , the restrained creakings , the very remote , very occasional voices . A bell jangled dully . A buoy ? What else was happening in the still night ? He fell asleep . To his own pride and comfort he realized later that he 'd slept . Now against the window pressed the vague dawn , without color or movement . He realized too that the engines were still silent . Now he could get up and investigate . Now that he could put upon his face a bright , anonymous smile . The dark night lay behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the caverns of fear ; away from the intangibles . . The Athenia , submarines , mines , were concrete things . On the deck he saw no one . Three separate strata of fog seemed to be shifting slowly , rearranging between them a shore of monotonous hues . Were they lying off Santander ? The figure of a steward passed from one hatchway to another . A glimpse : blue uniform , calm features , stable gait . The saloon was empty , and the dining room was closed . Nothing could be wrong . Five o'clock . On the deck overhead , footsteps pattered , hastily . " Anything the matter ? " he asked a minor officer . " No , what could there be ? " the man asked . " The engines are stopped . " " Oh , indeed . " " I thought , " he said , very pleasantly , irritated at the man 's brusque insolence , " that engines were stopped for reasons . " " No doubt . " Then the man added laconically : " Santander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coast , pacing away then on quick paddle feet .  | Next he saw the Dutch woman heading toward him , urgent with a mission . " Ah , shame , " she cried . " We 're both too early for breakfast . " " Quite , I fear . " " I missed you in the dining room last evening . Ill ? " " Not exactly . Tired , perhaps . " How was he going to shake her off , her guileless , probing eyes ? Here in the gray , equally guileless dawn . But he smiled politely . " We are the only Hollanders aboard . Passengers , I mean , " she told him . " Is that so , " he said discouragingly . " My husband , , " she said tentatively , not intending to say more  --  gazing away at the inhospitable-looking shore , smiling at it . She had now established her status . He waited , though he knew better than to expect her to finish her sentence . He , too , smiled when the shore was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , " she said then , suddenly bold , sure of the righteousness of her cause . " Oh , are you one of ours ? " Immediately he knew she made reference to his being a confessing Calvinist ; at the same time he knew he was going to deny it . How after these past ten days could he be one of her kind , how clothed in faith , assurance , and righteousness , one of the elect of God , one of the chosen few ? There was another reason for denying it ; it would break off their acquaintanceship at once . But he could n't simply say : . " No . " If he did , it would indicate that he knew what she meant . Therefore he said slowly : " I 'm afraid I do n't know what you mean . " " Oh , but ? " she said distraitly ? " Oh , I beg your pardon . " " It does n't matter , " he said hastily , seeing that she was ready for flight , trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had denied his Christ and his faith , now in so many words . And before this in all his actions . That was n't disturbing him most directly now ; it was this woman , the embodiment of his people , his nation . To that he had to return , and to that  | same unflagging faith and assurance that she had  --  even here off the shores of Spain . That troubled him most . " From Noord Holland ? " he asked her hastily . " Vlissingen , " she answered sharply , buttoning her brown tweed coat , sidling away . He returned to his cabin , asking himself why he had n't taken a train . It was more direct . He had acted as if he were fleeing from a crime . He undressed , shaved , and changed every article of his clothing . Then he felt better . The next day , at St. Nazaire , he felt his old self again . So much so that he left the boat as soon as it docked and took a train north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on land , he felt sure of every step he was going to take next . When the train at last rolled across the fat meadows of Holland , he could regiment his thoughts to the champing noise of the wheels . He decided it was time he settled down and got married . It would be the straightest , the most normal course to follow , even through the chaotic events shaping up all over the continent . He smiled upon Daverdam 's four highest towers , thoughtfully . He composed the words he was going to say to his mother , his grandparents , even Katrien . She must be getting to be quite a young lady ; he 'd have brotherly duties toward her . Renzel would be in the army , he thought almost gratefully . Now for a long time black night would be over  --  and next time , through the next night , he 'd have to try to keep a small lamp of sensibleness burning . He fumbled in his pocket and drew from it his receipted hotel bill . Without looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let them flutter over the meadows outside of Daverdam . It was foolish to have kept that receipt ; he did n't need the memento . Now it was done . By this time Mercedes would be up , out of the hotel , no doubt going about her business , shopping around for the next love : a different type , more durable , less Nordic , preferably .  | CHAPTER IX ALL MORNINGS NOW SEEMED TO Margariet unwelcome beginnings , devoid of all pleasant anticipations . Mathijs was gone . He had sailed for Alexandria and other outlandish ports , as first officer on the Buffeldijk . No consolation had as yet made itself evident . The days seemed freighted with evil . September was an accumulation of disasters and evil-boding preparations for even more disastrous times . That Mathijs would sooner or later get his wanderlust again , she had expected . He had even dutifully warned her , during many a previous day and intimate evening . She had noticed his time getting riper . The trouble was that the time seemed to be ripening for great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she placed Dirkie 's breakfast before him , Margariet had a premonition , as gray and positive as the morning itself . She 'd never see Mathijs again . Never . Leaving dreamy Dirkie to the eating of his breakfast , she marched to her mother 's house at once , forgetting to take off her apron or to put on a coat . The tears pressed hot behind her eyelids . Never-ending , black-crepe widowhood seemed to be stretching before her like a heavy-clouded , drizzling panorama . Her misery was like a finished painting , one in which consolation threatened to break through the gloom like a weak sun , but actually never did , because the painting was painted and hung there unchangeable before her . First she came face to face with Ernst in the courtyard . He  | looked so clean and freshly shaved and efficient that he irritated her . She snapped the briefest possible good morning in his direction , while she marched past him , unaware that she was baffling him and upsetting his plans . On the dot of nine Ernst had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chaperone that evening , when he intended taking Frederica Voost to a concert . Frederica Voost , he hoped , would be his future wife . Even if Margariet had known , it would have proved to her only that Ernst was a ridiculously conventional man , who had better inject himself with some recklessness and spontaneity . Already she felt completely hostile toward him for looking so spruce , so full of plans , so almighty capable of wrenching every hour out of the day 's socket to make it run more efficiently for him . Upstairs , she came upon her father , much involved in his complicated ritual of shaving out of three painted mugs , each with water of a different temperature . He whirled round from his mirror irritably , with lather spread all the way from his left ear to his right , even across his forehead . She was his favorite child , but this morning ritual of shaving now hung like a curtain between them . He mumbled a good morning as if his mouth were full of lather too , and turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't bother to shout her usual : " Good morning , Pappa . " Her heart was now swept clean of any good expectations , as if seven hearty Dutch housewives had scoured it with violent purpose , to store bales of grief there forever after . Descending the back stairs again , she found her mother in the shop . Mevrouw Haming read her daughter 's mood like a billboard . " Well , Margariet ? " she said . Margariet sat down , disconsolately , and started nibbling at a piece of hardtack . At the other end of the store a thickset woman was prodding the dried codfish with a practiced forefinger , while her grandchild agonized in front of the candy case .  | " Where 's Dirkie ? " her mother demanded next . " Eating , " Margariet said . " And you ? " her mother continued , in a sort of muted bark , intended to discourage the customers in her store from participating in this dialogue . Now a man came in for chewing tobacco , and he looked almost as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child before the candy counter . " Awful , " Margariet said , rejecting the rest of the hardtack . Somewhere then , outside , a cock crowed and it made her feel no better . He crowed because the morning was getting darker and danker . He crowed , demanding a brighter truth from the day than this rain-threatening morning made manifest . " Is that so ? " her mother shouted across the child , now luxuriously choosing his candy . The fat woman had selected three cods now and was probing a fourth . The man had inserted two fingers into the package of tobacco , and then tilted his mouth to his uplifted thumb and forefinger as if it were the most delicate operation in the world . He chewed , ecstatically . " Well , the best of everything , Mevrouw Haming , " he said , marching out . A gentleman , Margariet decided morosely . How could she answer her mother 's " Is that so ? " Now while the world was going up in smoke and wails . This was late September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the canal , even the Cross-Eyed Angel looked inhospitable . Her mother was now wrapping four hard fish for the fat woman ( I do know her after all , she 's from Widows Court , Margariet thought ) , who was saying to Margariet : " Yes , my Willem has the miseries , too . It 's the equinox . I read a piece about it on the Daily Manna calendar . " " Is that so ? " Margariet said politely . " Mine is deeper . " " Gallstones ? " the woman diagnosed tentatively . " Yes , tons of them , I think . " The woman approved of her no longer . Making jokes out of human miseries , making a kermis out of God 's visitations . That  | Griet Flaming had always had a mind like a hare . She approved a great deal more of the old lady , and thanked her now excessively as if Mevrouw Haming had made the purchases from her . Then , pinching her grandson 's scrawny neck between the fingers she 'd tested the cod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stoop she paused a moment in the rain . Then the door fell shut behind her . " It came just like that this morning . I knew it , putting Dirkie 's breakfast on the table . I 'll never see him again . Never , " Margariet cried . " Mathijs , eh ? " her mother asked competently . " Well , girl , figure it out for yourself . It was due to come . He 's been gone five days now . " " It is n't that , " Margarict wailed . " This time it 's more than that . I never felt like this . All my blood and my insides tell me . " " As if you could ever be a prophetess , " her mother mocked her . " Margarict , you have a wonderful mind , but why you always keep it locked away in a plush box of sentiment is beyond me . " " I ? " Margariet asked in fake astonishment . " Perhaps it hampers you to use your mind while you go scudding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning is filled with rain . Mathijs is gone . And so all you see is black oceans of misery . Come now , girl . " Margariet looked at her mother , hostilely . " This is deeper . This is something my mind tells me , as well as my blood . " " If you keep telling yourself that , you may as well go out and buy widow 's weeds , " her mother countered . Margariet opened her mouth in dismay , but subsided upon her unquenchable misery . Fortunately the storebell tinkled its bland , innocent voice just then . A woman came in to tell Mevrouw Haming that it was almost time for fall house cleaning , and how the days flew , and how terrible everything must be there in Warsaw .  | Margariet started nursing a new grievance against her nephew Ernst . He was n't real . He was a bore . The reason ? Mathijs had said he must have picked up a black penny there in Oporto and did n't like it . That had seemed an extreme diagnosis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nibbling at the hardtack again , she listened distantly to the customer 's ruminations about house cleaning during October weather . On the spur of the moment Margariet decided to start her fall house cleaning this very day . It symbolized something , too . It made her feel somewhat like Pilate washing his guilty hands . But the analogy was actually that she 'd clean her house to wash away her feeling of impending disaster . She never quibbled over hairbreadth interpretations . Yes , she 'd buy soap , brushes , scouring powder , soap powders , silver polish , glass polish , brass polish , gilt , some white and some orange paint , some sponges , a chamois skin , some cheesecloth , some blueing , some starch , some paste , some saddle soap , some turpentine , some lye , some  --  she started composing a wonderful list on the clean slate that hung beside the kerosene barrel , and on which the oilman usually made his calculations . She might have some of these things on hand , but she 'd get at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the cleaning of the month , of the town . More women had come into the store . They talked about Warsaw , and about the weather , which caused mildew . One man stepped in and stood waiting diffidently amid all the hub-. bub of feminine talk , as if he actually expected it to subside . Margariet scribbled on . Her list was a double column now . She drew flowers and men 's faces on the margins . That reminded her  --  her art . She had n't painted for five months . Tomorrow she 'd start out on her bicycle and go painting . Because  --  well , she 'd read it in some artist 's biography , on page 23 , to be exact : " Painters are the sunniest of the artists , the best-attuned to life . Dare we ask why , when we hardly dare answer , for fear of  | sounding omniscient ? Still , we suspect that only sunny natures become painters , or , supposing we 've put the cart before the horse saying that , do we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd remembered them , she could n't imagine . Now they made her decide to go painting , to the dunes , soon , to cultivate a sunny nature . This prophetic gloom was too much to bear . Tomorrow ? If the sun came out ? But that was impossible . Any good Dutch fall house cleaning lasted from Monday morning at five till Saturday evening at seven , leaving you five hours to prepare soul and body for the Sabbath day . Well , she 'd work out these inconscquentials of time and sequence later . She 'd paint dunes . She 'd paint her system full of sun . Dunes were the embodiment of joy , ranging like a bright fringe beyond the ominous present . Twenty-two customers had come and gone . Most of life 's workaday manifestations had been discussed . The country was neutral , would stay so as in the last war . But no matter what else was neutral , one 's own spirit was always a battle center , two women had declared . Margariet finished the hardtack , in spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guessing that the height of her daughter 's emotional storm was over . But then her mother , seeing her busy with extraneous thought , retreated and started rearranging things upon the shelves . She cast one comprehensive glance over Margariet 's slate and guessed correctly about the house cleaning . Good idea . But she did n't need all those things . Margariet , though by far her favorite in all the world , was definitely her problem customer , buying too much and paying for things she never had bought . I wonder if I did spoil the girl , she thought sentimentally . But of course not ; anything blossoming and spreading sunshine like Margariet should be left alone in her growth . You could disapprove of certain of her minor actions , like dashing over here , coatless and wearing a kitchen apron , but why make bones over so small a thing ? Why , if the girl ever allowed herself to grow up , or  | even let her mind keep pace with her emotions , she 'd be the most perfectly lovable being in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny bit impatient with Mathijs . Did he have to usurp all her being so completely ? But , of course , she thought then ; of course , if I 'd ever had a husband like him , God knows where I 'd be flitting around now . Still , for her own sake , later , the girl ought to grow up . Margariet now sat condemning Ernst again . He had come back , giving the impression that he 'd done so solely to pull the tattered remnants of the family into working shape again . He had gone into action immediately . Perhaps if they all were n't so easygoing , they 'd have resented it from the beginning . She herself had been too concerned about Mathijs ' imminent departure and all the war turmoil , and then Vladimir Goessen had attempted suicide , and Dirkie had got an upset stomach about that , and a fever , in which he 'd shouted about hip boots . In fact the child still thought of Vladimir as dead , or as he said , " worse than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round again was something more terrible than a visible ghost . . . . But to come back to Ernst , he had started regimenting the whole family at once . In a way it was wonderful and weird , because there , the first Sunday after his return , they had all found themselves , quite to their own surprise , sitting in the family pew in church , practically overflowing it . Ernst returning from sunny Oporto to herd them into church . All of them , except Renzel , in the mighty pew , sitting in a row : Katrien in a new fall bonnet with a pheasant feather ; Gezina , as respectable-looking as a gospel tent ; Mother like a wise and knowing steeple ; Father , like an ambassador from some mythical country , with cane instead of portfolio ; she herself , the eternal bride and widow ; Dirkie  --  God bless him and keep him , as well He ought to  --  the sweet muffin ; then Mathijs , the best man on earth , though he did n't seem to fit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , like the keeper of heaven in person , with  | the mien of a church usher and a psalmy voice . A whole pew full . Mercy , it had never happened again . Afterwards , at Gezina 's over the coffee , Ernst had said : " I missed these things in Portugal . Hence I came to appreciate them . I 'm sorry Renzel did n't come with us , seeing he is home on furlough anyway . " Ernst had said that , addressing the family in general , ignoring Renzel himself , who was sitting near the big potted fern reading a book . " Oh , do n't be such a moral fascist , " Renzel had snapped , looking up briefly from his book , then reading again . " What 's come over Ernst ? " she had asked Mathijs on the way home . " Must have picked up a black penny , " Mathijs had said . " But in those respectable striped pants of his , I ca n't imagine how . Certainly he has gotten full of manners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was more interested in his book than in a good argument . I was all set for it , but  --  well Gezina had that look on her face , as if she 'd made the boys promise not to flight when there was company . Dear Lord , life is getting to be heavy sailing . " Dirkie had told her afterwards that he 'd never pick up a black penny . Because it had made Cousin Ernst all concerned over everything , but he did n't even see you clearly , for all the things he was concerned with . Out of the mouths of babes , Margariet thought . Still , whatever was the cause for Ernst 's stuffy actions , black penny or not , it would have to be extracted like a bad tooth . Ernst had changed . Perhaps the evil times were responsible . It was n't a broken heart , it looked more like broken courage , she decided . Of course , they had n't been in church much all the eight months Ernst had been in Oporto . Not all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devout , but that was more manner than conviction . Was Ernst doing penance ? Then why did n't he do it like a man , with drink and curses and brown  | glumness ? Why did they have to be his witnesses , in church , and everywhere ? The times were dire , of course . You 'd realized that after the minister had prayed the long prayer , and the congregation had sung the grave psalms , and the minister had read from ReveIations : " And I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea , having seven heads and ten horns , and upon his horns ten crowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemy . . . And I saw one of his heads as if it were wounded to death ; and his deadly wound was healed ; and all the world wondered after the beast . . . and they worshipped the beast saying : Who is like unto the beast ? Who is able to make war with him ? And there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blasphemies ... " The beast was Hitler , unmistakably . For five days she herself had been converted , deeply . Dirkie had been converted for good , and now went to church every Sunday , to both services , and drew pictures of the beast in his copy book . The very lintels of the church had dripped with doom , old women had daubed their fears with Eau-de-Cologne , and men had looked bitter and apprehensive . But the minister had read in the very end : " Here is wisdom . Let him that bath understanding count the number of the beast : for it is the number of a man ; and his number is six hundred threescore and six . " That had consoled her very little , of course . She had felt inadequate before such numbers . It was like looking at one 's horoscope . Perhaps she 'd better get her horoscope read . She jotted it down at the foot of her list of house-cleaning supplies . She felt an immediate need of a horoscope-reading , what with her uncertainty about Mathijs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ernst , too , had talked about life 's patterns , but that had been the next day , just before Renzel had to leave again . It had all happened in the front vestibule , and perhaps it was just as well Mathijs had n't been there . Mathijs at that point had been all for  | booting Ernst into some convenient ditch . Ernst had been spouting something about duty , and life 's patterns , and responsibilities toward one 's conscience . And then he had looked at her as if he expected an accolade . He had said that all Portuguese were illogical , emotional , and willful . And he 'd gone on to utter some gem about the coming generation , which stood in need of spiritual regeneration , it seemed . Anyway , he 'd made it all cryptic and lofty , both , and she had suddenly realized that it was mainly addressed to Renzel , who simply stood there , staring at Ernst as if he could n't believe his ears . " You mean to say , " Renzel had blurted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pumped so full of religion that we dare n't take interest in the affairs of the world , because we might miss some fancy little upheaval in our pretty , private souls ? " Or words to that effect . " And I know whom you 're addressing that sermon to , but if " Renzel , Renzel , " his mother had cried then , hurrying into the vestibule with some small package he had forgotten . But with great dignity , Ernst had turned on his heel , and walked into the house . Looking for all the world as if he was on the way to some solemn corner to say a prayer for Renzel 's poor , misguided soul . It was at that point that she had decided , definitely , that Ernst must have a wheel of remorse revolving within a wheel of sin . It was disgusting and confusing . Fortunately , she 'd been able to love Renzel twice as much , to make up for her disgust for Ernst . So involved with these thoughts that she hardly realized what she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rearrange the shelves . Customers came and went . Mother somehow started discussing house cleaning , saying she 'd take care of all the supplies . Just leave the slate . . . As if she 'd intended carrying that slate home with her . Thinking that the rain would wash the slate clean , she looked out and saw that it had ceased and that a milky sun was trying to pierce the clouds . She took off her apron , because she was going out the  | front way now , into a socially better street than either Court Without A Name or the quay . She said to her mother that she felt much better . It was ten forty-seven by the clock . There was significance in numbers , surely . Every breath and every act is governed by God directly or by the stars , which are God 's instruments . She knew of a lace-curtained window with a sign saying : " Horoscopes and Readings . " She stopped there and rang the doorbell . A pale woman who ought to eat eggs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horoscope and a daily guide for one gulden . It disappointed her . She 'd expected a lot of occult hocus-pocus , trances and veils and crystals . The bad drawing on the cover of the little booklet offended her artistic sense . And the fact that her future had been printed by thousand lots on some obscure press , seemed insulting . On the street , freeing the pages with her fingernail , she read about September 27 : " A very favorable day to come to terms with your inner thoughts . Be kindly and considerate toward your fellow beings , especially your closest kin . Do not speculate . " That was all as it should be . Her closest kin was Mathijs and she was always kindly toward him . Then Dirkie , and she 'd take him home a present . Do not speculate . Was planning house cleaning speculation ? She decided to buy a new fall hat . That considerably buoyed up her still rather dejected spirits . It would please Dirkie , too , because the hat looked like something the wind had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought some tubes of paint . For the dunes . For Dirkie she found a fine set of warships , he could use in his battle between Gog and Magog . The minister was going to preach more about those two next Sunday , and Dirkie always listened as if he were being given a set of instructions . Everything was divine now . A patina of well-being covered everything . When she reached the house , she noticed that her mother had been there in the meanwhile , leaving a note saying  | that she did n't need any of the things on the list but the green soap and silver powder . " Just look in your cellar closet ! " the note ended , impressively . Margariet looked and laughed . It was full of all sorts of things . Funny she 'd forgotten . Then , realizing that the sun was getting bolder , she decided she could n't do all that house cleaning herself . Why not get two strong women , with great zeal for cleaning , and turn the house over to them for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to clean the house , and vindictively , in that time . She 'd pay them extra . She 'd have Dirkie stay with the folks , they 'd love it , and she 'd go to the dunes and paint . Nothing in the world was like a dune in September . She 'd start out in the morning . Dirkie loved her hat . There was a letter from Mathijs in Messina in the afternoon mail . Already she felt as sunny as a dune . The next few days , however , all sorts of matters seemed to keep her from going . The two cleaning women had been on duty for three days , their skirts tied high , their hair knotted tight , their faces screwed up grimly . The house smelled like a soap factory . The older of the two women seemed a composite of all sorts of contradictory traits . She was maternal , protective , and punitive all at once ; sentimental and yet hard . She fought with dirt , she focused her eyes , her voice , all her motions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layers of dirt that had to be obliterated . She made something sacred out of it . She declared , polishing a spot where there had been a cobweb , as if the fossil of the spider must still be there , that the world might be at war , but that was no reason for folks to go dirty . But where did it get anybody all this invading and slaughtering ? Twenty years from now and everything would be rearranged again . House cleaning now . . . She spoke in two different vocal pitches , voicing the contrary duality of all things . The other woman snorted her derision from the other room : " Well , a  | Jew is a Jew , and some are dirty and some are clean , and where does that leave you ? " The first one had her answer ready , as if she 'd pulled it from a neat top drawer . " Exactly nowhere , dear . That 's life . " The trouble was , Margariet was fascinated by the women . And the older one had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a pity now that Dirkie was already ensconced in her parents ' house ; he would have had a wonderful time , just listening . There was something amorous in the way the woman scrubbed , she realized . But she was getting to be in the way . There were few corners that she could sit in safely . It was mainly Ernst 's fault , however . Coming to her with that mien of **48;528;TOOLONG , he had asked her to chaperone him and that Frederica to the concert . " Did you learn that in Portugal ? " she 'd asked . " What ? " he 'd countered . " Did you learn to go courting chaperoned ? Did you like it so well you could n't get over it ? Here , where you never did it before , though your Frederica is sort of expensive ; I mean her pappa is pretty wealthy . No wonder Mathijs thought you 'd picked up a black penny . " She should n't have said that , it was n't ladylike . Ernst had been politely furious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as politely correct as an engineering job on the surface . But she 'd gone with them . And the evening had been a bore . Frederica afterwards would n't even sip the juice of a strawberry , and she crowed like a hermaphrodite rooster when she talked , and her legs seemed out of kilter with the top of her body . Not even a good engineering feat , she , structurally . Margariet had written Mathijs all about it , for consolation . But at last she started out on her bicycle . That morning the cleaning women had seemed extra corrosive . And Ernst was poking around with that pompous mien ; if she did n't hurry away she 'd have to go chaperoning again . She 'd decided in the meanwhile that she 'd paint the dunes in water colors instead of oil .  | Largely because Frederica had told her that her married sister had bought an oil . What kind of oil ? The personal insult of that question had got under even Frederica 's skin . An oil , of course ; what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? She had to pedal hard , because a signpost said the dunes were thirty-two kilometers away . She 'd figured on only twelve or fifteen . She did n't recall till she 'd passed Heer-Hugowaard that she 'd forgotten to tell Dirkie and her mother that she 'd finally gone painting . She giggled at the surprise of it . And would the cleaning women know where to stop , or would they keep going over the roof and chimney and up and up , right to heaven ? If cleanliness was next to holiness , well . . . Also she 'd forgotten to consult her horoscope . How did you put on a face that indicated well-bred passivity , when you cycled ? She should have asked Frederica . Because she kept smiling at the landscape , at children , at goats and cats and even a nice lonely looking bittern . People like Ernst and Frederica with moral love affairs ought to be drowned , or be inoculated , she decided . The dunes in the noonlight were apricot and golden . She 'd paint them maroon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dunes retreating from morals and manners . " She had to get off her bicycle to jot that down ; she was so forgetful . Seeing a woman with four small children clinging to her skirts watching her , she recalled the wear and tear of motherhood and suddenly felt guilty . She was always escaping her responsibilities . Who would be more inclined to accuse her of that : Renzel or Ernst ? If it was Renzel she would n't mind . At least he had a sun shining inside of him . She hoped that before long she 'd be able to like Ernst again . Such a fine figure of a man , too . Mounting her bicycle again , she inwardly spoke a sort of prayer for Renzel 's peace of mind . He was so harried . She imagined herself as burning a few little candles so that his sun  | might break through and shine . Mathijs liked him . Said : " Give him about seven more years . When he 's broken through his shell , watch out . Already I sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dunes . Up their east slopes they were a wonderful rich murrey . The path became steeper past a village with green roofs , yellow fences , and pomegranate-colored shutters . She went back and left her bicycle there , and then followed another , a sort of goatish path winding between brambles , ant heaps , and clumps of furze . Beautiful country . She could sit down anywhere and start sketching ; but something impelled her on to a higher spot . Like a ladybug . She looked back . From here the flat green land looked like a pattern in linoleum , the design slightly askew , hence linoleum on a bargain counter . The trellised blue windmill arms fanned lazily in a lazy wind . She loved that town the sun shone upon . She felt rueful for towns in shadows . Oh , but why had n't she brought Dirkie with her ? He could outstrip anybody in school , and this was so much better . She was a terrible mother , unmistakably . The dunes intoxicated her . She felt a great warmth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her world had been suppliant for peace , and here it was . . . She started painting , rapidly and fluently , then tipped her sketching board , letting her colors flow and bend , so that her sixth painting , which she 'd already called , " The amoral collison of Dunes , " seemed like tropical vegetation submerged in an aquarium of dartings that were the spirits of fishes . She renamed the picture , " Dunes descending to the temple at 12 . " That was better . Now she had to start a new canvas to fit the discarded title . For it she made the dunes orange with blue peaks and leopard spots like a jockey 's shirt . She painted God upon the dune  --  a large morning glory . It was almost finished when the little man with the two goats appeared on the path . All three looked at her curiously . But the goats understood  | her and twinkled their eyes and screwed up their noses . Bees danced around their nubbins of horns . The little man , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her at all . But he smiled wistfully , being willing . She showed him all her paintings . He shook his head fondly , but with an expression that said clearly that he was utterly unworthy of her interest . The goats sniffed and tried to nibble the masterpieces . The little man commanded them to be off . " Be off , be off , " he shouted , rather ruefully . Lord of creation he was , the goats whimsically winked at Margariet , knowing she 'd understand the irony of it . " May I paint them ? " she asked . " The goats ? But they have to be milked . My wife is waiting . " " Oh , but I work fast , " Margariet assured him , already penciling in the goats on clean paper . " And your wife , does she mind waiting ? " That puzzled the little man . " My name is Michiel Koenes , " he said defensively . " My wife 's name is Pennina . From the Bible . " " Wonderful , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skies upon the goats , then filling the goats in with lavender , opal , and sienna , making their horns like little olive trees . The little man shook his head . " But one is black and the other white . Or which are the goats ? " he asked . " The goats are everywhere . Just like the sunlight , " Margariet explained . " Maybe Pennina would understand , " Michiel said dubiously . At that moment Margariet saw the man 's very-much-scoured wooden shoes , and decided to paint them in . They became golden white in the process . " Your wife must be very clean , " she said , pointing at the wooden shoes . " Oh , no , not at all , " the little man answered brightly . Margariet was finished . " They say sometimes our Queen comes here painting , " Michiel was saying , peering at her in  | hopes that she might turn into the Queen . Though if she did , he 'd die of embarrassment on the spot . The last water color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the goats eyed it conspiratorily . " Now you have paint all over your arms , face , and everything , " he said to Margariet . " It 's nothing , " she laughed , feeling mischievous like the goats , wanting to paint fancy designs on his wooden shoes . They 'd wipe clean so easily if his Pennina should n't like it . " Maybe I could come to your house and wash up ? " " Ah , " Michiel said , drawing in his breath . " Maybe . " " Pennina ? " " Maybe you do n't understand . Pennina is different . " " Oh , is she ? " Margariet was instantly intrigued . She collected the paintings and started down the path with Michiel . " I have a wonderful little son , " she told him . " He 'd love it here . " " A son , " the man cried out in great amazement . " Yes , Mijnheer Koenes , but I have a husband also . " " Just call me Michiel , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . Well , because Pennina , she is different . She is quick and jumps over doors and wheelbarrows , and she had no taste for children . " He had weighed his words carefully . " But you 'll see , " he added . The goats , now in sight of home , started pulling hard , so that Michiel and Margariet had to break into a trot . The little house they descended upon was very old , built of yellow brick , with a thatched roof , and blue rain boards over the chimney , and an apple tree trained against the front gable like ivy . The goats now blatted as if they were broken-down alarm clocks . And at that moment , above the green-painted lower halfdoor , Pennina appeared . " You 'll see , because that 's Pennina , " Michiel panted , clattering on his wooden shoes behind the goats . Pennina was wearing a jet black , very flat , and very large sailor hat . Pennina was buttoned to the chin in rusty black .  | Pennina , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms and masculine gruff cries . Margariet was disappointed she had n't leaped over the door , and Michiel , surmising it , said : " She 's now past her prime . " Pennina seemed very little surprised that Michiel had brought home a painting woman . " This is Pennina , " Michiel said , stepping aside . Pennina straightened , shook Margariet 's hand with a vicelike grip . Margariet saw that Pennina 's hands needed washing ; everything on her needed washing . But upon her face shone a sort of masculine guilelessness . If she had been slightly more feminine , she would have been called a witch . Of course , you could see that in younger days she must have jumped over doors . Pennina was explaining gruffly : " I 'm rigid with rheumatism . Ca n't get up any speed . All right , you Amalekites . " The last remark was addressed to the goats , who had started nibbling her knuckles and polishing their little horns against her skirts . " Michiel ! " she bellowed . " Set some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was a strange house inside . Evidently Pennina reigned in it , and Pennina was dirty . Very un-Dutch dirty . There was litter and there were smells . Flies swung like minute dirigibles above the table ; you could imagine vermin . With what fanatic zeal her cleaning women could descend on this , Margariet tried to imagine . " You can see Pennina would n't care for children , " Michiel said diffidently over a copper kettle . " Now , would you like to stay for a bite ? " conveying that now that she 'd seen the situation , she could judge better . " I think I 'd like to stay and paint this , " she said . " Oh , I think Pennina might like that , " Michiel said , designating the only picture on the walls , a fly-specked and browncreased Rock Of Ages . She and Michiel were sitting down to tea when Pennina returned with the goats ' milk . She came to such a sudden stop in the center of the room that her arms with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then she sat down , without removing her sailor hat . She wore it always , Margariet decided . Pennina poured some goats ' milk into a saucer , flooded some tea over it and gulped it down in one comprehensive draft . Then upon Margariet 's invitation she studied the new paintings . " Wonderful , " she boomed . " But I do n't know what it 's all about . It is n't religious , " she added , glancing comparingly at the Rock Of Ages . " Well ... " Margariet showed her God on the dunes , the morning glory . Pennina scratched her hair under her hat , plucked at her ears , and snorted through her nose . " Maybe I need glasses , " she suggested helpfully . When Pennina had had seven saucers of tea and goats ' milk , she sent Michiel to the inn to fetch Margariet 's bicycle , in spite of the latter 's protest . It seemed Pennina wanted to talk about politics . She was for politics and against just sitting . Talking politics to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Take the world situation now , " she preached , full of conviction . " We are doomed . Our little butter-cheeked nation is doomed . Because there across the border they know how to organize force and propagate cruelty . They are positive and we are negative , and that 's why we 'll be trampled upon , and smashed , for a while at least . " Margariet listened to her in awed amazement , at the hefty and sonorous words rolling with such grim conviction from the strange woman 's lips . She realized she did n't even have to say anything , just listen . She felt inarticulate anyway , and here in the dunes her horrible premonitions started crowding against her again . " But . . . but . . . " she raised her voice twice , futilely , in protest . Then through the window she saw Michiel returning from the village with her bicycle laid across a large green wheelbarrow . Three cats were following him . " Oh , the cats , " Pen-  | nina cried , breaking off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor beside her . " Two are n't here , " she explained . " One is in heat , and the other , " she shrugged expressively . " Well , they 're together and they 'll appear later . " Already Margariet felt considerably better , and started a painting of the interior of the house . But only outdoors could she find complete relief from her depression . She placed Pennina on the stoop in all her rusty regalia and the utterly horizontal hat . Then she painted her and the outside of the house . When Michiel peered over her shoulder , he approved of it . In the end Pennina came and took a look , too . " But who 's the personage on the stoop ? " she demanded . " That 's you , " Michiel said . " Oh , go on and run away , " she shouted . " I 'm right here and not on the stoop . " " You see ! " said Michiel expressively to Margariet . " Except for politics and .... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , naturally , " both agreed . " But I do n't know if I like that personage on the stoop , " Pennina persisted . " He looks like a Catholic priest . " " But it is you , " Margariet assured her . " Is that so ? Mercy , I must have changed . We have no mirror , you see , " she added in explanation . " But how do you do it ? With such small white hands , too . " She examined Margariet 's hands wistfully . " And she has a little son , " Michiel said . " Goodness me , " Pennina said disparagingly . Then they went inside again and sat down to a badly cooked meal of apples , potatoes , and salt pork mixed , and something else Margariet could n't recognize except that it had seeds and hulls , but they might have gotten in there by mistake . " Are you Dutch ? " she asked Pennina . " Goodness , what a question , child ! " the latter cried , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Because I wear a hat in the house ? I know what you mean . They say American ladies do it too . Now America is a wonderful and democratic country , but no I 'm not American . All my folks , for seven generations were born in this house . " At that moment Margariet picked something alive and crawling out of her neck and decided not to stay the night . Besides , Pennina had told her that they went to bed before the sun set . She presented them with the pictures of the house , and at a last request removed Pennina from the stoop . " People might think it was a priest , " Pennina said conclusively , watching Margariet sponging the figure out and putting a woman with an ample blue house dress and yellow hair there instead . " That 's better , " Pennina said . " That looks like a caller , and I like callers . " On her bicycle Margariet made a swift descent into the village , through clutching brambles and staring cows . That night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd captured three more of Pennina 's crawling beasties before she went to sleep . The next day she climbed the dunes again and executed nine more dune manifestations . Her peace had returned completely and had even banished the premonitions that had beset her so horribly again during Pennina 's political speech . How could that strange creature possibly know what was going to happen in the civilized world ? The dire state of Europe was bound to get better , she decided illogically as she pedaled home again with her art . Daverdam 's towers beckoned whimsically . All people upon the roads seemed young and in love . She exhibited the paintings to the folks . Only Dirkie understood them fully . One of them , " The Dunes Speak Ardent Hopes , " not only had God as a morning glory for motif again , but also Dirkie and Mathijs sitting at the foot of the dune . He recognized them both immediately , though they were featureless , hardly more than happy motes of sunlight . Ernst was  | critical about a bridge in the dunes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridges , " Margariet explained with a grand dismissal of logic . Again Dirkie understood . " Still , I know it 's ten times better than sitting in the CrossEyed Angel , drooping , " her mother commented . But her father was so full of news he could give little attention to art . Poland was no more . The hordes of Gog and Magog  --  and had n't the minister been accurate , identifying those two as Stalin and Hitler ? ? had conquered , raped , and ruined it . What , in view of that , could be the value of painting dunes ? Gezina said that the colors made her feel sort of sunstruck . But Gezina was unmistakably worried about Renzel . Katrien was out romancing with that German beau of hers , of whom the entire family disapproved . Margariet went home , while Dirkie and his grandfather went to take a final evening look at the defenses outside of town , which were now undergoing frantic betterment . Ernst soon expected he 'd be called ; his class of reserves was bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , coolly impersonal . Margariet found her house scoured , reckingly and inhospitably clean . It would take months of living in it to get it back to normal . Hastily she left the house again to meet her father and Dirkie on the ramparts . She took the boy home at once , and immediately she noticed an improvement ; the ghosts of cleanliness were already in retreat . She pinned all the new water colors on the walls , and together they examined them at their leisure , though very critically . She told Dirkie about Michiel and Pennina , and he was enthralled . But why had n't she made an extra picture of their house ? So Margariet set to work at once painting a picture from memory , telling about the goats , the cats , the lice , and Pennina 's hat . As she went on , Dirkie thought of the dune trip as something justifiably apocalyptical . The dunes were the kingdom of God on earth . Dirkie knew it , and so did Margariet.  | So the Koenes ' house emerged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the stoop , an angel wearing a black sailor hat . Michiel stood exalted in a corner near a fence between two goats . Dirkie loved his mother , forever and entirely . Together they began writing Mathijs a letter , all about it and the dunes . It might reach him in Salonika . " And did they know there is war ? " Dirkie asked , stopping in the middle of his second page . " Pennina and Michiel ? " " Of course not , " Margariet lied , almost fooling herself . " Or any rumors of war ? " Dirkie asked importantly . " None , " she said . Dirkie began writing again . He had decided to make his letter one hundred and forty-four words long , the holy number of Revelations . He had to stop and count frequently . He understood so much more than he wrote , and he hoped Father would realize that . " Ernst , " he added as a footnote , after he 'd reached the hundred and forty-fourth word , " says that virtue is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it under water seven minutes to drown . It is dead now . Opoe says , where are our watchers , where our defenders ? So I went to the defenses with him and we saw that we are not prepared . Still , we have the bravest army in the world , have n't we ? "  | CHAPTER X DREAMS ARE ALWAYS TOO PERSONAL , too intimate , especially when their significance is half hidden , or half in flight . That is why the dreams that other people dream can never have great meaning for you . Dreams are always private , hence always somewhat indecent ; they come from an inviolable citadel , which they never enter again . They are refugees , that would rather return , but can not . Renzel sunk his head deeper into the pillow , allowing Leenie to cushion her chin more warmly into his shoulder . The alarm clock tick-tocked the precise minutes of the November slantingrainy day . You must be very quiet , the alarm clock said abstractly ; you must sleep and not make any sound ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now half awake , he was trying to remember what he had seen in his dream . He had been at camp , standing the third watch , and dawn had come upon the land like forlorn mist . Up a hill , then upon its crest , then down its other side , three men had gone , one large and two small men . They were silent , but not stealthy , remote because of the dim light . Mine is the third watch he had to keep reminding himself , setting talons of possession into his receding dream . Then all he could see was the telephone wires above his head , gradually limning themselves more clearly against the gray page of sky , like a stave of music , upon which the cold plump starlings sat like the heavy whole notes of the Dutch psalter . Then  | the vision had been transmuted into sound , the stave becoming the music of Psalm 42 , with grave male voices singing the words , higher women 's voices lilting them more enticingly to God and heaven : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ en riep vol angst tot Hem ; kHeb voor zijn aangezicht , mijn klacht In mijn benaauwdheid voortgebracht . I cried unto the Lord with my voice ; With my voice unto the Lord did I make my supplication . I poured out my complaint before him ; I shewed before him my trouble . And then the telephone wires emerged again , the starlings upon them cold and silent . Because the world was cold and man slaughtered his fellow beings and everything was engrossed with evil . And now in the silence were only the three men , intent on evil , marching back . I am the one to be slaughtered , I am the one of the third watch . Third watches only end in death . The alarm clock said to him : but I am the keeper of time , also your time . He opened an eye and looked at it drowsily , and then at the rain 's great morose slanting out the window . He felt Leenie 's breath upon his shoulder , so he lay very still , only shifting his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girls in the other room will be sleeping late . Because I may n't awake you . By what sum and substance of events , and what subconscious calculations had he come here ? As if the alarm clock 's clickclacking into time demanded it , he tried to make sums and totals of all his reasons , all the events . But his thought kept slipping on the slippery ledges of oblivion . There where only dreams could tread . The sum of your omissions and commissions , canceled by the sum of your intentions and rejections , brought you to a sphere where only ghosts abide .  | This was Sunday and there was nothing apart from that that he needed to know . Leave everything that pertained to time and its passing to the cheap alarm clock hurrying there fretfully like an underpaid civil servant . This was climax and aftermath , both . His regiment was stationed at the German border . His country was in danger . This was liable to last long , ending only in death . Then automatically they 'd acclaim you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm , but on free Sundays he did n't go calling on his uncle because the sum of his misgivings was always unconquerable . Unconquerable also had been his incapabilities , both real and fancied . Worming now into the memories of those , came the words from Katrien 's letter : " Ernst is so full of correct actions and politeness , you 'd think he 'd come from Germany instead of Portugal . I 'm hating him very much . You are much wiser . " That flattered him , and yet .. . He turned his eyes from the rain and closed them ; then , shifting his head slowly , he looked at Leenie through lowered eyelids . So close , he felt a great pity for her ; so near that a hitherto unsuspected tenderness inside of him welled high against his throat and he could hardly breathe . Sleeping against his shoulder , as if he could protect her endlessly ; sleeping securely , because this was good and holy , and more than that . " Little one , " he mumbled , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the master or protector , he never even pretended that he could be . " Little one , " he said again , stroking her forehead with his closed lips , sliding his mouth across her eyelashes . I know now , I feel it now , he thought incoherently . Sleep on now , sleep on . . . . He lay very still , resting his eyes on the blistered ceiling . The rain rattled undertones to the alarm clock 's chattering . Over the back of a chair hung her stockings . The door was closed and the room seemed concerned with its own silences . How had this miracle come to pass , and why did n't he have any misgivings  | now ? But there was nothing to argue against , nothing to apologize for , nothing to lay out in so many words and expound . He had n't been able to make himself go to his Uncle Moente 's . And somehow he felt little duty toward going home , now that Ernst was there . Ernst with his stuffed-shirt platitudes , Ernst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight coercions to make him go to church . No , perhaps it was all for the better if he stayed away ; he and Ernst would come to blows before long , and , for his mother 's sake mainly , he wanted to avoid that . But the cruel and tragic unfolding of history made it seem unsafe to be alone . He had few friends , because he was difficult . So he 'd taken the train here , and Leenie , seeing him , had said , firmly : " No . " So he 'd been rejected , and he 'd suffered , and then it had been evening with a wet wind and leaves rotting and streets cold . He 'd come here again and they 'd gone out into the bleak weather . They 'd argued , bickered , and their words had scurried away from their intentions like frightened rabbits . Somehow only one thing had been certain ; there was not going to be any parting between them that evening . With so little done , so much said but so little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end , as if it were the unalterable answer : " Renzel , dear , we 're both tired . And confused . We ca n't talk any more . We 're going home to sleep . You 're coming with me ; we 're going to sleep . " " Yes , " he 'd said softly , as if his answer was half-smothered by a great feeling of warmth and gratefulness . " We are both fools and neither of us knows what 's good for him , " she 'd continued , her voice , too , sounding like something that had been hurt in the tussle and was seeking a safe burrow . " Yes , Leenie , " he 'd said again . That was n't a man 's way . Not the conquering male 's . Nor the tempted man 's . Later they 'd talked only a little . Their words had fallen like outdoor sounds , pleasing , but not touching them : " We must be very quiet . We  | ca n't afford to repeat this often . You must set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So it had happened , by way of hesitations and contradictions , cross-purposes and weary denials . Even the desires had played no immediate part , no direct role . And here they lay , he possessive and protective , as he 'd never been . She asleep , her brown hair asleep , her eyelids , her voice , her rebukes , her pity .. . The alarm clock gathered time like dust and shook it away like a busy housewife now . That was the sound , because tenderness was suffusing him again . " Good morning , Leonie , " he whispered , his lips nibbling the ridge of her nose . " Because . . . good morning , Leonie . . . " She opened her eyes slowly . She saw him and she closed them again , and snuggled closer . " When you sleep again . . . " she said without meaning . " When , Renzel . . . " He cupped his chin in her hair ; " Because , because ... " he mumbled , his words crying a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And sweet dreams , Renzel . " " Good night , Leonie . " Good night in the morning with slanting rain . Yes , I 'm the keeper of time , so you can sleep , the alarm clock chattered conspiratorily . Already she slept again . With his chin pillowed on her hair it seemed then that he simply had to summon sleep to come . Sleep came running , on soft slippered feet . Sleep said : You 've called me at last , Renzel . You have commanded your helper to come . Sleep bent over him then and whispered : This is what you need . " Good night , " he whispered . " Good night , " Leenie said from a dream . All this was unanswerable and incomprehensible . It had no end ; it was inviolable and whole . Later he 'd recall this night again and he 'd put a finger on it and say : I found it there , where I had n't looked for it . So everyday it 'll come back again .  | The clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am the Alpha and the Omega , the beginning and the end , " the preacher read from his high pulpit in Daverdam . Beneath him sat Gezina , thinking of Renzel . And Dirkie thinking of God like one of his mother 's dunes . And Ernst expunging from all his thoughts the vision of a cheap room in Oporto . Russia was preparing to invade Finland . Amelia , Leenie 's very blonde " sister " peered into the room and saw them asleep . She did n't approve . Leenie let herself be swayed too much by sentiment . Romance was fine if you could achieve it , but you had to find it in your own class , on your own terms . Amelia had strong socialistic tendencies , even in regard to her avocation ; she despised the men she had recourse with both socially and morally . Had she been told that Renzel might be in agreement with most of her inchoate theories , she would n't have believed it . He came from another class , and Amelia tried hard to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because Leenie was getting older . Nothing had troubled or exalted Amelia 's dreams . She 'd come home at three , dog-tired . Even her curiosity at Leenie 's closed door had been at such low ebb that she had n't tried to find out who was in there with her . Geertrui had been asleep . Her room smelled of incense : Rose of Bagdad . Amelia had been soaked through by the rain , she 'd undressed , she 'd fallen asleep . Now Geertrui 's room was empty , her bed made . Geertrui always spent Sundays with her widowed father in Zwolle . Amelia prepared herself a very meager breakfast , because in another hour she 'd have to meet Alexander Van Dommelen on the Rembrandt Plein , for Sunday dinner . He was a young Jew , with parents in the city , who had n't yet come to the house because he thought that was too dangerous . He 'd come home with her today . If he was true to his race the dinner would be a good one , because they liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun was breaking through the clouds . On the black-bonneted chimney tops , starlings sat warming themselves against inadequate ribbons of smoke . Amelia , feeling precise and efficient , started dressing . While she put on her mascara sparingly , she hated Leenie for making a fool of herself . Another year of this , and she , Amelia , would get married . It was ridiculous to grow old doing this . The sun broke through the clouds and laughed at her . She blinked . Oh , well , this was dreary Sunday . She arrived at the park twenty minutes late . When she saw she 'd kept him waiting , she felt better . Her protestations were obviously exaggerated , while he sputtered only politely . Of course he was a Jew , dapper , neat , and slightly pedantic now that he was piloting this so obviously non-Jewish girl friend to the best restaurant in the city . I bet your father could buy my kind by the gross , she thought . And as she talked she gave her voice that high inquisitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to indicate good breeding . The restaurant seemed Sunday-dull , it was so early , but it seemed his parents were out of town for the day and he wanted to make the most of his time . She had guessed that previously . He was young , and showing off in a young way , and she was determined to take advantage of it . She looked very sweet , very young , but also so experienced . That 's the way he wanted onlookers to see her . I 'll humor all your whims , she decided , if you 'll pay for it handsomely . He did n't say he was a Jew . He hedged , as if it mattered . She was no stinking Nazi , far from it . But if you tried to put them at ease telling them that , they became self-conscious . And what could be more delightful than his ordering the best dinner , as he was doing now . He told her that his name , " van Dommelen , " should be spelled with two m 's and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stones from his mother 's bracelets . Such a fake , unJewish sounding name ; wonder what his father had paid for it ? Father , Mother , Uncle , and Aunt were visiting their parents up north it seemed . Amelia was interested ; she 'd been up north . " Where , " she asked . " Oh , Daverdam , " as if the town were something negligible , in spite of its clean Nordic sound . " Hmn , " Amelia said appraisingly . " My sister Leonie , her gentleman friend comes from Daverdam , too . " " Is that so ? " Alexander lifted his glass of burgundy politely . " Yes , and perhaps they 'll get married soon , " Amelia said sentimentally . " But times being what they are , and he being in the army , well , we wonder . . . " " Another few months and I 'll be called , " he hazarded . It was obvious that he was n't of military age , or he 'd already be in uniform . " However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trip to America . " " We ? " asked Amelia . " It sounds wonderful . " " Well , you know the rest of the world is hardly a paradise , " his young neck , young voice , young chin all belying his sure statements . But his eyes upon her were full of desire . Appraising her , too , evaluating her price . Because , after dinner , he expected more , and his folks would be back by ten , so he could n't waste time . He told her he had to sit in on a family conference . Deathly bore , but .. . Amelia now started to act very demure and tender , very understanding . If he was in such a hurry , he 'd get more desperate , and her price would be according . If he evaluated her as chattel , he 'd get chattel in the end  --  so much for so much money . So she started to act exactly the opposite from the way he expected her to act . " I 'm really a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He glowered disappointedly and then leered . Now the bar-  | gaining was on , she knew . " Well , of course , " he said . " Of course , if you . . . " God , he was crass and callow . She smiled at him , vaguely . " Oh perhaps its just the weather . I seem to be rather out of tune with the weather . Now my sister Leonie " Is she home ? " he asked anxiously . " But of course . And so is Renzel , that 's her fiance , the one from Daverdam I was telling you about . " " Oh , " he said dejectedly . Obviously he did n't dare tackle the problem of a hotel . But he was learning fast and might know the ropes in a few months if the Nazis did n't get him first , poor duck . " But , " she said encouragingly , " if you wish to take me home , I think that can be managed . That is , if you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little old fashioned . " His pride and self-composure came back at once . He was so naive , you could read him like a poster , seven streets away . But he now tried to hold her hand and she did n't approve of such tactics in public . Also the hard afternoon light made his emotions upon his face seem so commercial ... . Renzel and Leenie had at last gotten up , getting in each other 's way without trying to avoid each other , without trying to make conversation . They were now sitting in the little kitchen eating black rye bread with Leiden cheese , some cold wurst and an apple , counting the chimney pots for a game , gazing dreamily across the grimy roofs of Joden Breedstraat . In the west the sky was becoming flawed with scarlet . At seven he 'd have to catch a train back to camp . Amelia came in , leaving her escort on the stairway . She scowled at Leenie for not being dressed , at Renzel for being only partially dressed . Haughtily she closed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they seemed so unconcerned . " Amelia gets pettish sometimes , " Leenie said . " Of course , " Renzel said , forgiving Amelia and forgetting her . Then they heard Amelia whispering to her friend on the other side of the door . Footsteps scuffled past . Amelia 's door closed . " I wonder who he is ? " Leenie asked . " I do n't know , " Renzel said . They sat close together , watching the west become luminous , the scarlet flames whole scarlet vistas . " Leonie and her gentleman from Daverdam , " Amelia explained to Alexander . " Would you like to meet him ? Perhaps he knows your grandparents . " " Oh , no , " Alexander said , eying the closed door gratefully . Besides , my grandparents live outside of the city . I hardly think he 'd know them . " They 're , well , they 're rather exclusive . " " Naturally , darling , " Amelia said . Later they heard Renzel and Leenie leave the house . Alexander breathed easier . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet him , " he said hypocritically . " One never knows , does one , " Amelia answered elegantly . Leenie walked to the station with Renzel . Nothing was said about meeting again , as if they understood this had been no casual event , and words would only make it seem so . " Now I know , " she said into the noise of the station , watching his train slide out past her . " Now I know . " In the crowded train Renzel knew nothing . This was something without pros and cons ; it was a warm and deep feeling of resignation , of repose . He shut his eyes so as not to see his fellow passengers , so as to stave off for a little while longer the besieging army of actualities . In Benjamin Street , that noon , the Abrahams ' had received their sons and their wives with open arms . Two days ago they  | had had a note announcing their coming . There had been something intangibly portentous about that note . Now upon all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first the old Abrahams couple had been primarily disappointed that neither Isaack nor Asa ( the I &; A van Dommelen Brothers , Exporters and Importers , Kanseliersgracht , Amsterdam ) had brought their children . Then their sons ' announcement that they were going to America made them forget everything else . To Vrouw Goessen 's chagrin Asa 's expensive-looking American automobile was parked in Court Without A Name , almost touching her fence . Seven urchins were examining it knowingly . She hoped they 'd damage it ; watching from behind her curtains , she planned revenge . Jews , circumcised whoremongers . Her heart was a ceaseless cauldron of rage . Within her fence her crying flowers were now frozen , and the children would not molest them . They might turn their destructiveness upon the car . She hoped , watching impatiently , churning up her hatred . " But there was room for Alexander in your auto , " Mother Abrahams had wailed . " He has not visited us for three years and he is our oldest grandson . " " Alexander had an important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squirmed apologetically . They indicated delicately that they were there because their husbands had brought them ; personally they preferred sitting in less dark , less obviously Jewish houses . Besides , they did n't think much of Daverdam ; it was a small provincial city , and it was wholly accidental that their husbands had been born here . Then they sat back , prosperous and serene , listening distantly to their husbands . The older Abrahams ' nodded their heads earnestly , listening to Isaack and Asa 's portentous message . They looked at each other from time to time , trying to believe it was true , trying to  | be fair , trying to read upon each other 's faces the answers they could n't formulate alone . They were painfully simple , Asa 's wife thought . She conveyed her opinion to Isaack 's wife , without any perceptible gesture or sound . Secretly they both hoped that the old people would remain adamant to their husbands ' pleas . They saw no reason at all why the old people should n't stay in this old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could possibly be interested in them ? But they both looked rigidly noncommittal every time their husbands looked at them for support . It was foolish trying to transplant such old-fashioned folks to America . Was n't it difficult enough for themselves and their children ? And their immediate needs and dangers were much greater . Asa was now appealing to Father 's good judgment , Mother 's emotions . It would be soon now , unmistakably ; Hitler would invade I Tolland and conquer it . Perhaps they , being old people , imagined themselves out of danger , but supposing they were , did they want to be separated from their two only sons , who would be there in America , riddled with anxiety about their old parents when the invasion became a fact ? An invasion here ? The old man tried to argue . Here , where we are better off than anywhere else in the world ? In this country ? It ca n't happen , it wo n't happen . Is n't this our country , first of all ; and have n't we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sacred promises ? " That you want to move your business , well that is different . One 's business is so important , is n't it ? Is n't it , Mother ? " he asked ironically , appealing to her in his desperate anxiety . " Ach , so important , " the old lady cried her answer , " one eats and lives and prays for it . One makes his business his God . And Isaack , Asa , you should know better . You ... " The two younger women looked out of the window . Again Isaack started pleading , logically ; Asa , emotionally .  | " We 'd rather live and die here , would n't we , Mother ? " the old man said . " We shall die here , " she pronounced gravely . Asa shrugged and the two wives shrugged , but Isaack looked at his mother , hurt : " How can we leave you here ? We know it 's going to happen , we can see the immediate danger . Why , if you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " " Ach . Isaack , " the old man said . " Already you have thrown away my name . It was n't good enough . Now you are throwing away this country , which was always good to us . Now you are trying to destroy us , uproot us , to make us die of misery and loneliness there . " He pointed dramatically southward , forgetting the exact direction of America . " It 's a wonderful land , Isaack , but our tents have been pitched here long , and in peace , and God shall leave them in peace . " His wife wept unconsolably now . There was a long silence into which the cathedral clock clanged seven strokes . It was half past four . The Gereformeerde church was letting out its worshipers , five minutes later the Hervormde began doing likewise . There was a sound of solemn feet upon the streets outside . And Asa started pleading again in a low voice . Isaack 's wife thought about her two children in Amsterdam , Lois with the governess , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderfully affluent gentile family . Alexander knew how to meet the right people ; he would do well in America . She was happy she had made him learn English thoroughly . Also going to America would keep him out of military service . Asa 's wife was thinking about the maid she had to dismiss tomorrow ; it seemed foolish to get a new one with so little time left before they went to New York . Still , her maids never stayed long , perhaps her children were too lively , and Dutch maids were getting so exacting , now forming a union , too , mind you . . . They heard the footsteps of more worshipers . Then someone  | had opened the front door and was shouting " Folk , Folk , " ? a child 's voice . " Ach , it 's our little boy , " Mevrouw Abrahams said , drying her tears . She hurried out and came back with Dirkie , who looked suspiciously at the strangers , because they had obviously made Omoe Abrahams cry . They on their part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blond thing . Dirkie was a little abashed , and told them at once that he had just been at church , the second time that Sunday . He did not tell them that he had come to discuss the sermon with Father Abrahams . " And what did you learn in church , little boy ? " Isaack asked . Dirkie recognized condescension at once . Besides , he was not a little boy . Also he only discussed sermons seriously , not as a joke . He did n't answer . " He 's our David , our little David , " Mevrouw Abrahams announced somewhat reproachfully . " He 's our little grandson now , are n't you ? " She looked at her sons in grievous rebuke . Dirkie went over to Father Abrahams , but he did not sit down , realizing that he 'd better leave soon . He had interrupted an important conference , no doubt . Mijnheer Abrahams put his arm protectively around him , but Dirkie did not like the two great ladies at the window who were flashing wide smiles at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asa shouted : " Now come here , little fellow , I have something for you , " he walked toward him with great dignity , and graciously accepted the silver gulden , thanking the man politely . " And now what are you going to do with all that money ? " one of the women asked , as if he were only five , or a little girl , or perhaps a dog . " I 'm going to buy paints and paint dunes , " he said gravely . " But now I must go home . " He shook hands with each of them and between the two old people he went back to the door . " Come back soon , " they said  | to him . He promised . He understood . He clutched his silver gulden . Soon he 'd be able to paint dunes with God and the seven vials of wrath . When he had turned the corner , the old couple still stood in the vestibule , looking at each other long . Slowly the old lady shook her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his handkerchief he wiped away her tears . " No evil shall befall us , Rachel , " he said , in a thin , shaking voice . Then they went back into the house together and their sons read the final verdict in their faces , before the old man said : " We are going to stay here . "  | CHAPTER XI THAT WINTER WAS BITTER AND VIOLENT ; the worst that people could remember . The canals had been frozen solid for weeks , and schools had resumed their classes again because the ice holiday was getting altogether too long . Now on Saturday , however , the canals were noisy with young skaters ; gradually , too , older people started emerging . From her shop windows Mevrouw Haming watched them , angry at her sciatica , which was now at its peak . She could hardly get around at times . And look at those skaters , some of whom were as old as she was ! Mijnheer Haming was asthma-ridden . At times his coughing seemed to shake the walls of the house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country 's defenses ; any hostile army could now invade it unhampered . How in this execrable weather could the river provinces be flooded ? They would freeze solid and become more accessible than ever . And the country 's army of defense was no more than so many sheaves of straw . He worried vociferously and endlessly . It was of no consolation to him at all that his son Moente was visiting them this week . How could the fellow leave his river bottoms there at the German border so unconcernedly , so blindly , even so inarticulately ? Because Moente refused to argue with him . There was only one consolation in having Moente visit them at this time ; the sharp cold and the strong winds had removed every trace of farm odor from him . Thank God for  | small favors at least . For the rest , everything seemed doomed . Sitting in grim silence in the hot living room Mijnheer Haming stroked the cat glumly . " Do you think our little love can thaw away this cold ? " a woman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for the day , because Winston Churchill was going to give a speech from England . Mijnheer Haming coughed . " What can I do ? " he asked the cat . The night before had been an alternation of coughing spells and dreams in which a body of men were continually trying to electrocute him , and in which he continually escaped by way of a coughing spell . Why should n't I get drunk ? he asked the question point blank of his conscience . But he 'd never been drunk . Oh , God , how he suffered . People seemed to travel behind their plumed breaths as if they were spellbound by them . The clock on the cathedral was frozen . The iron wife stood impotently encased in ice , hours and days on end . The iron man , immured in even more ice , was hardly more than a glazed bas-relief , half-blended with the two nearly obliterated gargoyles . It was perpetually three o'clock . Daverdam lay rigid beneath that frozen hour . Late January , and immobile and inarticulate things creaked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Impassively the harbor tower and the gloomier Camel tower loomed brown strength against all the white beyond . In contrast to them , all people looked bent and perishable . " How long , oh , Lord ? " This many weeks more and we 'll perish surely . But look at the brave Finns holding back those unspeakable Russians in an even colder land . Hence I might be your ally , the Winter seemed to answer ; with me too , it 's all a matter of treaties , diplomacy , politics , and economics . There are a hundred different ways in which I can be swayed . Sparrows and starlings lay frozen stiff at the foot of the towers . The city fathers ought to do something about it , sentimental people said . Two babies froze to death in an old house-  | boat in the miserable back gullies of south harbor . It was an outrage , people said , bringing up children there . Churchill was going to give his speech . The Queen was going to address her subjects from The Hague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The majority considered the weather too cold for flags . Gezina was going skating that afternoon on the wide moats outside the ramparts . There were going to be three brass bands , twenty-odd refreshment tents , and a four-hour skating contest . She was still a good solid skater , perhaps not with exquisite grace but with impeccable steadiness . Paired with her brotherin-law Moente , she could still be a sight for sore eyes . As far as skating went , those two seemed completely matched . And they were friends , unspectacular but firm . In fact , she knew that Moente felt closer to her than he did to his own sister Margariet . Perhaps because brother and sister were both , in their own way , pretty independent individuals . Moente was a marvelous man , she had decided long ago , especially when once you realized that his reserve was only a sort of scaffolding which you had to climb over to come to his real worth . Gezina went out to have her skates ground ; she took pride in supervising the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year they were married . Her healthy round face blossomed youthfully in the sharp cold . Her stride was sturdy , her carriage erect , and all the skating she had done the last few weeks had nicely reduced her excess poundage . She met the minister and solemnly shook hands with him , asking him about the Finns . But he started talking about the Synod of Dort , and the current deplorable wave of spiritualism . " Do you skate ? " she asked , showing him her skates . " Once I did , " he said laconically . He should have said that wistfully , she thought . " But my children do , " he added as if to justify himself .  | She smiled a warmer smile at him . He was a good man , and if he was born earnest , he could n't help that . Still , she wanted him to ask about Renzel , and he did n't . He did say , however , " What a faithful churchgoer your son has become , Mevrouw Haming . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . Did he know ? " Yes , " she said . He started shivering , so she detained him no longer . The man who sharpened her skates was a theorist . This time he was concerned about the Christian Labor party . She had to use all her powers of insistence to keep his mind on the skates . She pointed out imperfections , and insisted that he do the job right . Then through the window she saw old Mijnheer Abrahams pass : fur cap , fur collar , bit of white beard and red nose , all tagging a plume of frozen breath . Poor man , she thought , hoping that his sons might be utterly wrong in their prophecies . The sons were now in America , and Mijnheer Abrahams was perpetually bowed with grief . Dark premonitions started tugging at her now . Sharply she said to the man : " You 're grinding that one too much on an inward slant . I could do it better myself . " That relieved her . Dirkie felt forsaken , lost , and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ever . All week it had been this way . The Abrahams ' were inconsolable because their sons had fled to America with no enemy in sight . Both Abrahams ' sat close inside their dark tents of grief . Besides , he did n't feel religious any longer , now that the minister had started taking his texts from Corinthians . Only his own thoughts about Gog and Magog and the vials of wrath and the beast with many horns still mattered , but in an altogether different way . Because , one day walking with Omoe they had come upon the minister , and those two had talked long and seriously , chiefly about the prophecies of war . Then Omoe had  | said to the minister : " And here is one of your most enthusiastic listeners , Dominie Zierhof . This grandson of mine , he takes every word of your sermons to heart . " But the dominie had looked at him from a great height , and had smiled a cold polite smile , and had said in dry words : " Well , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , children understand so little , so very little of those cryptic things . " That had hurt him awfully , because he had actually understood a great deal more than Mother , for instance , who said that all the awful prophesies made her reel in bed at night . He had lost his faith immediately . New grief had been added today . That morning he 'd started skating on the moat , feeling rather kindly and remote toward everything . But he was always slow , and somewhat ponderous , even on skates ; he simply had no speed in him , because his thoughts kept impeding him . But this was the day of the races , and all boys were trying to prove their speed on skates . Dirkie knew there was no use trying , but only yesterday Father had said : " Perhaps you ca n't skate fast , son , but you do skate gracefully . " It had made him glow with pride . So that when the boys had started taunting him because he was n't fast , he had said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't skate fast , but I do skate gracefully . " That had been the wrong thing to say . They had jeered at him . They had surrounded him , and pushed him over , chanting : " Graceful Dirkie , graceful Dirkie . " For a long time they would n't let him alone , and when at last they did , he had tried to skate fast , alone , but his misery was too great . He had seen his father and mother , but he had hidden himself behind the voluminous skirts of two old women selling hot chocolate on the ice . But the women were on skates too , on old-fashioned curved ones , with their skirts hooked to the fancy curlicue toes of the skates , and they had been able to skate much faster than he , even with their jugs of chocolate . So Father and Mother had wanted him to skate with them , but his humiliation was  | too great . Then he had seen some people clamber over the dike to go skating on the slips and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ docks , and he decided that it was the only place left for him , too . At once he had felt relieved . There beneath him stretched the peaceful white channels , on which only old men and strange boys skated . So he started out , grave with imaginings again , feeling disturbedly hostile to his father who was always with Mother now , making him feel set aside . Father had been back only a week , and this time might stay a long time . Then he thought about America , which stood for all things free , wide , and wealthy , and he wondered why those sons of the Abrahams ' had n't taken their parents with them . He himself would someday live in California , Minnesota , and Oklahoma . He had already marked those states with golden stars in his atlas . Those names were marvelous . Also , he 'd grow a dark beard when he grew up , he decided , letting his thoughts sweep him on along the straight , greenwhite ice of the bosoms . He wove in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where once their sea had been . Their eyes were full of memories and melancholy , not seeing what was there , but what had been there before . Sometimes an old fisherman had his aging wife in tow , and then they made wonderful swoops . In their pomponed jersies , their funny caps , with their clay pipes in their mouths , their hands on their backs , they made such majestic curves that they almost circled back upon themselves with each stroke . They never got anywhere except in their own way , Father had said . Nevertheless it was wonderful , and grave , and full of meaning , especially since each of them in passing shouted : " Good day , my little lad . " He did n't mind being called that by old fisherfolk . The white silence of the white fields was all around him , and he felt alone at the core of all still things . Even the voices he heard seemed more like the echoes of voices that had been lost  | for years . Sadness settled upon him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed him . Old men were n't really people , he decided . They were more so . Then suddenly he realized where he was . He was on the deep bosom , flanked with dead eelgrass , where Vladimir had almost drowned  --  and almost drowned , he knew , was worse than drowned . Because the man who now walked around the town as Vladimir , was really only a shell of a man , a man whose soul was lost forever . Sometimes even that seemed hard to believe , and terribly complicated . And here suddenly he was at the exact spot . He knew , because he had often looked at it from shore , after the fishermen had pointed it out to him . Now he was actually above the spot , upon the glassy ice . He stood there peering through it , into the frozen bubbled blackness beneath . There Vladimir 's soul had perished . There lay his soul , banished . He knew . And now Vladimir 's soul looked up at Dirkie and tried to say something . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words . He stood there enthralled , petrified . He knew he was alone with Vladimir 's soul . And now he should ask it about those boots , and why , why , why ? But he did n't dare speak to a spirit , here in the bitter white silences . Suddenly he fell down upon the ice and sobbed . The mystery was too much , the terror and grief too much . He shook with sobs , and did not even see the old fisherman on high curved skates who came to a stop beside him . The old man hunched down and asked : " Little laddy , laddy , what is the matter ? " At first he could n't answer , but the old man started straightening his red stocking cap upon his head , and looked so concerned himself , and kept saying : " My little laddy , now , now , now . " So at last he blurted out : " Here it is . Here he lost his soul . Here , and I told him . Vladimir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now , now , now , " the old man said , staring at Dirkie , starting to feel uneasy , because he , too , had seen spirits many a  | time . But not in daylight , not yet . But the eyes of children could see things in their innocence that could not be revealed to their elders . " Now , now , now , " was all he could manage to say , and then he fished a peppermint from his pocket . It was a soiled peppermint , with brown edges , and it tasted a little of tobacco and tar , Dirkie realized when the old man pushed it into his mouth . But he felt consoled . " Danke , " he mumbled . Then the old man wanted to take this strange child from this horrible place immediately . The child had seen inner things , hidden things . He felt a great compassion and a great fear . Suddenly he suggested : " How would you like to skate along with me ? You behind me ? " Dirkie beamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody had forsaken him he 'd go swooping along behind an old fisherman . This was a miracle , akin to Christ 's walking on the waves . Perhaps the old man was one of Christ 's apostles ; they had all been fishermen and some people believed they were still on earth . Gratefully he bobbed his head and the old man lifted him to his feet at once . Then the old man stood at attention , facing west , putting his hand on his back so that Dirkie could lay his left hand in it . And then they got into motion . It was all true what Father had said . One swoop led them to one side of the channel , the next to the other . It took all of his attention and endurance to make his strokes as long as his host 's . Finally he managed , but he had to keep his eyes fixed unwaveringly on his feet . The old man kept mumbling wonderful consolations , meaningless and strange . Dirkie was in ecstasies . He was skating with one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above all earthliness , and the strange rhythm of the great strokes hypnotized him . And so it happened when Moente and Gezina decided to go skating on the sea side of the dike , also for reasons of memory  | and sentiment , they passed an old fisherman , swooping gravely along with a little red-capped boy in tow . When they looked again , they saw it was Dirkie , who had not seen them at all . They stood still and laughed and felt better , because Moente had been telling her how they had received orders from the government to keep themselves prepared to evacuate their farms at once if the enemy started invading Holland , because the rivers and the sea would be let in over the lands . Listening to him , Gezina had worried about Renzel . And then they saw Dirkie . " Seeing that , " Moentc said contemplatively , " makes me realize how strongly of late I can find myself yearning for Daverdam . It 's strange , because . . . " " Bring home a green vegetable when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Katrien earlier that afternoon . " Oh , Mother , " Katrien had wailed passionately , for no logical reason . " A green vegetable , " Gczina had said unperturbed , emphasizing the green , as if that clinched the matter . " Oh , " Katrien had said , storing it in her mind . Because at that moment she had been greatly in doubt as to whether she wanted to go skating with her German beau or not . The entire family disapproved of Hans , and of late she was having misgivings about him herself . And to go publicly skating with him , where all her acquaintances would see them together , was a thing she could n't take lightly any longer . Also , he was a rotten skater ; he skated like a hen scratching . Probably all Germans did , she decided grimly . A green vegetable . Though he had many more manly and desirable aspects , she could compare Hans only with a green vegetable at that moment . Hans with his bare , frost-bitten knees , frigid shorts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all romantic glamour . And yet . . . Maybe she was just a silly coward she decided . But for a long time she  | could n't make up her mind to leave the house . Maybe , she thought maliciously , if she let him wait long enough , his knee joints would become frozen . But then there was the inducement of her new skating costume . She examined herself in the mirror again , admiring especially the short flaring skirt trimmed with rabbit 's fur . Well , Hans or no Hans , she simply had to go skating in it . But as she finally left the house , she enumerated three very good reasons why she was getting to hate Hans . They seemed sharp and scratchy reasons . One , she 'd started to mistrust all things German . Two , she did n't like his arbitrary claim that she belonged to him and no one else , simply because she allowed him to kiss her . Three , after reading a very modern novel , she had gotten a romantic crush on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , coming to this third reason , she pined and yearned inconsolably . Recently , too , and for no patent patriotic reasons , the hometown boys seemed much more desirable than the Germans . When she 'd discovered that , they had somehow conveyed to her that they could n't do without her . She hopped out of the courtyard gate until she remembered to be ladylike , even in her short green skirts . She even shouted a hilarious greeting at old sour-puss Vrouw Goessen , and was chagrined with her Cousin Liesbet for being so far gone with her baby now that she could n't come to Daverdam for the skating . On top of that she decided her Uncle Moente was in his own way a romantic figure . A strong and silent man , of romance . Perhaps some day she herself would marry an older man , someone experienced and suave , and essentially cruel . Passing Monette and Adriana she asked them blithely how business was . They did n't mind . They were going skating , too . " What a sweet outfit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katrien preened herself . She went on , whistling : " Love is an ardent thing , so save  | your strength for it . " Liesbet 's Gerrit had been called to the colors with the new batch of reserves . Oh , well , he need n't be ardent now . Then she saw Hans , waiting for her at the quay . He was bracing himself against the cold wind and looked pink and sturdy enough . Still her spirits plummeted , and she could n't help pointing scornfully at his chapped knees and crying : " I 'll go back and get my old muffs and you can wear one on each knee . " But he remained his usual officious self , and very possessively he piloted her to a bench and started putting on her skates . At least he laced the laces very efficiently , she thought , already relenting , blowing teasingly down his neck . He rewarded her with one of his famous grins , which seemed to say : You 're wonderful , but you 're really mine , and nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she snapped : " Oh , you 're wonderful , wonderful , I-Ians . Now if you could only skate ! " " You 're very , very gay , are n't you ? " he said in his strange dialect , and she could n't tell whether he really meant it , or whether it was sarcasm . She never could tell with him . " There now , " he said next , taking her hand , pulling her to her feet . " I can get up by myself , " she protested , seeing two of her acquaintances staring at her disapprovingly . " And you 'd better remind me to get a green vegetable for Mother , " she added unreasonably . But she thought : The way they stare at me , as if I were skating with a leper . I might as well be swathed in burlap sacks for all the effect my skating costume is making . Still , once upon a time she 'd almost fallen in love with Hans . And sometimes she felt she still could , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Perhaps I 'm not fair to him  --  just because the whole country is turning against the Germans . Still , he ought to be back home in Magdeburg , where all his patriotic zeal could be appreciated . And if she ever caught him trying to take a snapshot of the reclamation works , like some of the German tourists , she 'd smash his camera ,  | and no mistake . Combating her sudden antagonism toward his whole race , she said : " Now do try to skate like a man . Take good , long , firm strokes . Do n't go scratching about like a hen . " " Naturally , " he said with his impenetrable dignity , which was either a part of his patriotic code , or simply an integral part of his personality ; but whichever it was , she did n't like it . She began skating behind him , her hand laid in his on his back , Dutch fashion ( they did it differently in Germany , he said ; they did n't even know the first principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was she who had to do all the work . She did the guiding , and she kept their course straight with her firm , economic strokes , with the ten times greater dexterity of her body . She knew she had him now at a decided disadvantage , even a physical disadvantage , but she felt no pity for him . For once he was n't piloting her around , guiding her , directing her , protecting her even . She skated faster , more grimly , when she saw people stare at them and smile in derision . She blushed with shame when Mathijs and Margariet passed them , and did n't even greet them . Even her romantic crush for Mathijs now hung inside of her like an icicle . But it started melting , when she saw the leopard-like ease of Mathijs ' body , the athletic , almost loping movement of his thighs . Her impatience with Hans mounted , as she watched Mathijs hungrily , and she almost steered Hans into the reeds . " Have n't you even got the strength to keep your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the clear ice . " Listen ? " he said angrily . " Listen , if you ? " but then he controlled himself again . But as she kept guiding him , increasing her speed , she could see his continued anger by the tautness of his neck . If I gave him the chance now , she thought , he 'd give me one of his fine lectures , about manners and behavior and chivalry . But she was n't going to let him . And his anger only made her feel better , perversely . She kept pushing him far be-  | yond his speed , and only when she realized what a silly spectacle she was making of both of them , did she relent . It was high time they got off these very public canals and moats , she decided , seeing an old school girl friend of hers skim past her for a second time , with a faintly mocking smile on his face . And then came Ernst with the fashionably limp Frederica , and even those two ignored her studiedly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Ernst did that , she 'd take up the cudgels for Hans any time , she thought contradictorily . " Come on now , " she said with beguiling pleasantness , " that was really lots better . Now let 's get ourselves organized and go a little slower and handsomer . One , two , three , " she counted , very encouragingly , flatteringly , too , and she felt him respond , and for a hundred strokes they sailed along comfortably . " You must admit I make a good little Diesel engine , " she demanded , trying to make him forget his too slowly ebbing anger . I really do n't blame him for being angry , she thought , feeling displeased with herself , till a little farther on they passed Adriana and Monette , both emitting high giggles , watching Hans with unashamed scorn . It made him stumble again , and without taking time to weigh her words , she said angrily : " Perhaps you 'd better go skating with them . They seem to enjoy your way of skating , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stubbornly he stopped now , and turned on her . His eyes were grim and his mouth hard . " Katrien , " he said slowly , " if you keep saying those things " Is it because they 're Jews ? " she interrupted him , touching on an old sore subject . He ignored her interruption , and continued : " I said , Katrien , I wo n't have you saying those things , or . . . " He paused significantly . Suddenly she laughed at him . " If you only knew how handsome you are when you 're angry , " she cried . She had meant that as a mere flippant remark , but suddenly she thought : But of  | course , that 's true , I like him angry . In the next breath she added , before he had a chance to say anything else : " Look , 1 guess it 's better for you and me to get away from the public . There are too many eyes on us . And it is n't at all romantic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she knew she had n't from the way his eyes probed her face , so much so that she had to look down . " All right , " he said . " That 's fine , " and immediately he started guiding her toward the old dike . Half protestingly , half fascinated , she obeyed him . After all , she had wanted to get away from all her acquaintances , had n't she ? They climbed over the dike to go skating on the old salt water channels and the bosoms . But on the other side of the dike they both fell silent , though he skated much better . For his sake now , she guided him away from the few fisherfolk skating there , knowing that they were far more voluble in their dislike of the Germans than the townfolk . Then as they skated sedately along the silently white bosoms she felt strangely wistful , oddly yearning . It was a vague yearning , and then she remembered having read something about love quite often emerging from anger . But because she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced herself to think about Mathijs instead . After all it was for Mathijs she had been pining the last few days . And that was simply a fleshly passion , not love , she reminded herself , as if now to keep herself in check . And all this passion was inspired by that very modern novel she had just read . For some obscure reason the book had been called Shrimp and Sardines . In it a worldly-wise hero and heroine had discovered , soon after they were married in a grim town in the pinewoods , that he had already slept with her mother , and she with his father . They decided promptly on suicide as the only way out , but there were also some complexes involved . In the end it all turned out all right , because their car skidded , and they decided not to have a rendezvous with  | death after seeing it face to face . But then the hero had punched his father 's jaw , and the heroine had stuck a safety pin into her mother . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scolded her daughter for reading such trash . Just after she 'd finished the book , however , Uncle Mathijs had come home again . Like that of the book 's hero , his face was like a cat 's , cruel , sensual , and humorous . His eyes were elliptical , bespeaking deep emotions , great passion , and also fickleness . And Mathijs had a strong nose , and she knew what that indicated about a man 's particular prowess . Also his lips were curved like a gull in flight . So when she 'd shaken hands with him , she 'd actually trembled . No wonder Aunt Margariet was perpetually in love . Actually , Katrien had to remind herself forcibly , she was almost sure she was falling in love with a young fellow in school called Kees Wanrooy . But she was keeping that pure , on a higher and saner level . And Hans ? For instance the way he kissed  --  the way his kisses always started so politely , so casually , and then got too much meaning into them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had to draw back . Draw back simply because he implied her mouth was his for the taking , and forever . Or was n't it that ? Now , for instance , now as they were skating far away from all the people , along this wide silent channel  --  what was he thinking about her ? She said suddenly , making her voice tender : " You know , Hans , you will make a fine skater some day , and you know ... " She stopped , because she felt his fingers kneading hers fondly , and though he had n't yet said anything , he was slowing down , forcing her to a standstill . She did n't quite know why she got frantic about it at that moment , why she kept pushing ahead , trying to extricate her hand from his . And suddenly in the midst of the struggle he lost his balance and fell , clinging stubbornly to her hand , so that she fell down on top of him . " Hey , " she found herself tittering , trying very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that is n't fair , dragging me down with you . That 's not being a sport . " But as she tried to get to her feet , he pulled her down again , smiling at her now , with that wide possessive smile of his . Suddenly she became playful , and angry , too , and started kicking his absurd green hat away from him . But he was n't even trying to retrieve it , he was n't even conscious of it . He held on to her and pulled her closer , and he said thickly ( his voice always got thicker and more German when he got romantic , she remembered ) : " Katrina , Katrina . . . " " Do n't call me that , " she snapped . " It sounds silly . It sounds as if your teeth were coming out . " But he 'd forced her head down and pressed his mouth over hers . For a moment she wondered if she was going to yield , but feeling his mouth wet and hot on hers she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushing him away from her . Trying to recover herself , she taunted : " Maybe people in Magdeburg fall all over you on the ice and then kiss you . Maybe they do , but here we are more civilized . " He did n't even seem to be listening . That smile of his now stood awry on his face , and did n't seem a smile any more , and with more abandon and positiveness than she 'd ever given him credit for , he pushed her down , and forced his mouth down on hers again , while his hands went over her , exploringly . She started struggling again , and she cried maliciously : " You fool . Let me go , you fool . I do n't want you , see ! " And then as he seemed to be listening to her , listening and looking at her with his eyes hot and hungry , as she 'd never seen them before , she added tensely : " I do n't see how you dare do this . I 'm sure Herr Hitler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys . Now leave off ! " But her sarcasm faded from her voice and only a violent mixture of anger and fear remained . Because she knew that he was n't going to let her go now . Not now , while he pushed her head back , and acted as if he was actually going to stop to give her one of his lectures first .  | As if he were actually struggling with his duty to do so , while all the time his entire being was intent on something else . " Katrien , " he said hotly . " Katrien , do n't make me angry now . Do n't now , Katrien . " It sounded like a final desperate plea , but also like a command , as if he dared her to contradict him . " Stop that , " she said brusquely , trying to shake him off . " Do n't make a fool of yourself here . " But he did n't stop . Instead he started kissing her violently again . " I said stop it ! " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not this way . " She clawed at his face ' now , and pushing it from her she shouted : " Not from you , you dirty Nazi ! " ? realizing fully then that she was afraid of him , and that her fear made her hate him . He started shaking her , and then he slapped her face . " Yes , yes , that 's it ! " he barked in a confused jargon of Dutch and German . " Yes , that 's it ! All these months you 've been trying to make a fool of inc . You and your whole damned degenerate country . You little teasing fool , you ! You 'll all be sorry . Soon we 'll have you all where we want you ! Now I 'm glad I could help my country and my leader to conquer your miserable race . I 'm glad that I spied on you , that I ? " Suddenly he stopped , realizing that he had said too much , brought to his senses by the horrified and incredulous way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words had simply bereft her of all motion . " You , you , " he growled , trying to cover up with more words what he had told her . " You leading me on . All these months , driving me mad , leading me on ... " Suddenly she kicked at him violently , digging her skates into his ankles , setting her fingers like talons in his neck . " So it was true ! " she gasped . " It was true , all they said about you ! And to think that I liked you , that I . . . " Seeing his face grow purple and his mouth hard , feeling his hands now pull at her dress , ripping it , she thought violently : Now I 'm going to fight . Now I 'm going to fight him . But  | already she was fighting like a cat , biting at him , scratching , digging her skates into him , till he tried to pull away from her , tried to cover his face , and she , feeling herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ice , while he kept tearing at her dress , following her . " I 'll get you . I 'll get you ! " he panted . " You little fool ! " But this time she kicked him off , and , gaining her feet , she fairly leaped away from him , and kept going , never looking back . " No , no , no ! " she gasped , skating at breakneck speed , though she knew that he 'd never be able to catch her . " And I helped him ! I encouraged him ! " Now her terror was almost mounting to hysteria , and she wanted to say aloud : " But you did lead him on . And you did act like a fool , a fool girl , and then ? " It was n't that either , not entirely . No it was n't that either . Everything was horribly confused in her mind . She clutched at her torn dress and whimpered , but suddenly , finding herself among other skaters , she forced herself to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry . And she did n't want to cry . She only wanted to get home now , fast , at once . . . At a furious clip she kept going toward the dike and Daverdam 's towers . Then for one insane moment she wanted to tell the whole town about it . She wanted to warn them of the danger . She even wanted to tell everybody what a fool she had been . But the next moment she thought dismally : But I used to like him . And I did encourage him . . . and so I made him more dangerous . I protected him by being friends with him . And it is n't because he tried to seduce me . No , it is n't that , she argued feverishly with herself when her conscience once more started to assail her . " I 've got to get home , " she said grimly . " I 've got to get home quickly . " Without removing her skates , she struggled over the dike and down onto the moat on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She did n't want to see any friend of hers  | now . She darted wildly across the ice to the opposite bank , and then , seeing Adriana and Monette approaching in the distance , she fairly tore her skates off and started running for home . But there was no one in the house and she could n't make herself go into her grandmother 's shop and face her . And she did n't dare to be alone . Then she heard the radio in Grandfather 's room , and she ran in the direction of the sound . Over the radio Winston Churchill was advising Holland and the other neutrals to join the Allies at once . And Opoe was stamping up and down the floor in great excitement . When he saw her come bursting into the room , he wheeled on her , and started shouting hysterically : " But lie 's right ! Churchill is right ! I knew it all the time ! I said so all the time ! But what are our people doingeverybody  --  what are they doing ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he kept gesturing wildly . She stood there looking at him , her mouth agape . Suddenly it all seemed too much for her , the old man 's excited screeching , her own choked-up hysteria . Somehow she knew she had to try to calm him , but she could n't . Instead he seemed to be destroying her last desperate attempt at self-control . " Opoe , " she groaned , still struggling against the words that were there practically in her mouth ? " Oh , Opoe , everything is so horrible . So absolutely horrible . I ca n't stand it any longer . I ca n't . And Hans , all the time I encouraged him , all the time I actually helped him , and now look , now look ! " She pointed at her torn dress , and started sobbing . Through his coughing he peered at her , his face hideously contorted . On the radio Winston Churchill continued his speech , but he was n't listening to it any longer . " You , you , you ... " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on by his own coughing . " You , Katrien , you , what did they do to you ? What did he do ? " But his voice died out upon the frenzied pitch of the question . His eyes grew stark for a  | moment , his face became purple . He lifted his hands futilely , and then he staggered . Coming to her senses at last , she ran to his side , clinging to him desperately , breaking his fall as he collapsed on the floor . " My heart , " he whispered . " Call your Omoe . " " Opoe ! " she gasped . " No , do n't ... " The radio boomed noisily on , with Churchill 's voice still exhorting the Dutch to get ready . . . Suddenly she jumped up and started running down the stairs . " Omoe ! " she shouted . " Omoe , quick ! Come quick ! "  | CHAPTER X11 HEY HAD NOT SEEN EACH OTHER FOR weeks . Now they were going to Haveland together . Ernst had deluded himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a forgiving spirit , at the same time proposing that they should make use of their Sunday furlough by paying their respects on Liesbet who had given birth to a boy . Renzel , however , had been truculent from the first moment Ernst had proposed the visit . He had argued that Liesbet had never been a great favorite of Ernst 's , and furthermore that he could n't see why he had to be a victim of Ernst 's favorite pastime of making dutiful and correct social calls . " You 're simply making a nuisance of yourself since you came back from Portugal , " he had argued . Of course , he had intended spending that Sunday , or at least Saturday night , with Leenie . Ernst , sensing this , had been all the more adamant . That was yesterday , and this morning , Sunday morning , Ernst 's forgiving mood had long since vanished . He felt selfrighteously aggrieved , and completely unwilling to sympathize with Renzel 's attitude . He refused to see that in his earlier forgiving pose he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspects of this visit to Haveland . Besides , he had simply ignored the fact that Renzel 's furlough had started the previous afternoon . He had simply compelled his brother to wait for him , making him stay overnight at his cantonment , insisting that they catch the train together  | at the Doesburg station in the morning . He knew that Renzel could have spent the night in Amsterdam and met him at Haveland some time during the morning , but because he suspected Renzel of an affair  --  and definitely an unsavory affair  --  he had seen no reason why he should n't put a crimp in it , even though it was for only one week end . On the station platform , Renzel had been in a black and argumentative mood . At first Ernst had tried to soothe him , but when the argument had somehow started to center about politics and economics , Ernst had diplomatically separated himself from his brother . After they had boarded the train , he managed to find a compartment where they could not sit together , thus terminating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been kept on duty till this morning , as the demands for special engineering projects kept increasing , especially since the thaws had set in after many weeks of bitter winter weather . He had been grateful when his class of reserves had at last been called . Daverdam had started to pall on him . After his heart attack , Grandfather had been very slow in rallying and needed perpetual watching . Katrien , because of her foolish affair with the young Nazi  --  who fortunately had left Daverdam immediately afterwards  --  seemed to be in a continual state of tension . His own affair with Frederica had reached a stage where he could bide his time . Fortunately the new work at the border was all the time making new demands on him and creating new interests for him . Especially since the defense of the eastern border had started in earnest . All roads leading into Germany were being mined . Even trees , innocent-looking clumps of bushes , and new flower beds were filled with hidden deadly explosives . Bridges and viaducts could be blown up upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toes were the elaborate preparations for the systematic flooding of the low river lands in the central provinces . That was an additional reason  | why a visit to Uncle Moente 's low-lying farm interested him . All the technical aspects of his work fascinated him ; but he thought little about it as part of a national or international crisis . In the train his thoughts kept returning to Renzel . Covertly he watched his brother , who sat there , three seats away , with his long legs stretched lazily in front of him , his eyes half shut , his mouth fixed in a sulky droop . Again and again he wondered what Renzel was up to in Amsterdam . That it was an unhealthy affair , seemed inevitable to him . But thinking about it , he kept recalling Mercedes and Oporto , and each time again , he had to shut off his memories forcibly , by turning his eyes from Renzel to the March-chilled , rain-murky landscape . Those Oporto days were over ; he had reshaped his life along new and better lines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow his thoughts to revert again and again to that horrible little hotel room , with its flies and cockroaches , above all to that heavily sleeping , halfnaked girl on the bed ? Indirectly , it made him more impatient and intolerant of Renzel . It was high time , he decided , that he got at the root of this affair . Everything Renzel touched was bound to get himself and others in trouble . There might be barely time even now to avert a scandal . Now that his own affair with Frederica had reached such a satisfactory state , it was imperative to avoid all scandal . Once or twice , however , he called himself a prig and a busybody . But he did it halfheartedly , almost indulgently , as if he were only fooling himself . For the rest of the short train trip he did not look in Renzel 's direction again , but he decided that on the way back from Haveland he 'd try to worm some of his brother 's secret out of him . He 'd have to watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground of sympathy left between them . After they got off the train , they strode without speaking to each other through the Sunday-quiet village . Ernst found no  | ready words with him to pry Renzel 's silence apart . Renzel was simply concerned with his own chagrin . Why had n't he been simple and direct enough to tell Ernst that he had no intention of going to Haveland ? Instead he 'd only ineffectively argued that he had no desire to see Liesbet 's child , and that Liesbet could have no possible craving to show it to him , or to Ernst either for that matter . Ernst 's ridiculous demands were keeping him and Leenie apart . Ernst and all his silly social hocus-pocus . His impatience for his brother mounted as they left the village behind them and strode on toward Moente 's farm . He had noticed that Ernst had intentionally shunned him in the train . Perversely now , he decided to make him listen to his arguments . " What about Portugal ? How 'd you find things there ? " Renzel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dike . " What about it ? " Ernst asked suspiciously . " Oh , I do n't mean what did you eat or drink and whom you did go to bed with , " Renzel grumbled . " I mean what about the political situation there , for instance ? The attitude toward fascism , and toward the civil war in Spain , and " You forget that I 'm an engineer . And that I did n't learn to speak or even to read Portuguese . " Ernst interrupted him . " Yes , I suppose I should have taken that into consideration , " Renzel snapped . " With you . All right , I think I get you . You do n't want to talk about Portugal . " Unwittingly he was throwing Ernst into inarticulate panic . When Ernst did n't answer , he added : " Well , perhaps Portugal is n't significant . Not as far as our argument goes , anyway . " " What argument ? " Ernst asked coldly , recovering himself . " Oh , any argument to forget this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swept his arm derisively around him , indicating the cold gray clouds heaped above the flat wet land . They were now on top of the dike , and the cold spring wind kept whipping them unmercifully . " No , that is n't what I mean either , " he  | added angrily . " Because I 'm serious . Because here we are , both of us in uniform , both so-called defenders of our country . But why ? Did anybody ask us if we wanted to be ? And what are we supposed to be defending ? I bet you never even asked yourself that question , or you would n't be so damned stodgy about it all . " " Oh , come , come now , " Ernst said irritably . " Do n't let your wild ideas run away with you . " " Well then , tell me , what are we defending ? What are we fighting ? " " Hitler , of course , " Ernst said angrily . " Or fascism , I suppose you 'd call it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , here in Holland , in that case ? Why did we kowtow so long to the Fascists ? Why even now do we keep sticking our heads deeper in the sand like ostriches ? We are pretending that our only danger lies in an invasion by those fanatical monsters across the border , forgetting that our own opportunistic statesmen , who call themselves democrats , arc Fascists in the bud . Maybe they 're not so preposterous as the Germans , but they 're Fascists just the same . I tell you , the only thing that can save us , and I 'm afraid it is already far too late for that , is the overthrow of this outmoded capitalist system of ours by a really socialist government . But that 's exactly what we 're running away from . And not only we here in Holland , but also the French and the English . But it is bound to come some day . . . or the only awful alternative , fascism . . . " Carried away with his own earnestness , he was shouting now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him scornfully . " But what about our promises ? " he shouted . " Are n't our promises sacred ? Are n't they , even to such a man as Hitler ? That is , as long as we keep our own affairs straight , and our neutrality intact . And that 's what we ought to do . That 's why Hitler has a right to demand that we defend our western coast against England as much as we do  | our eastern boundaries against Germany . It is our duty to stay neutral , and if we do , even Hitler will respect us . He 'll have the decency to realize that Renzel fairly groaned , stopping in his tracks to look at his brother in mute amazement . " You ca n't mean that ! " he cried then . " You must be just arguing because I 'm making you argue . No , Ernst , I ca n't believe you mean that . Now if you were Grandfather , or some other old fogy . Because if you do believe in your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , serving in the army against a potential but very definite enemy ? Just because it is your duty ? My God , that 's an argument of straw . Duty to what , to whom , to what ideals , and why ? " Ernst smiled at him pityingly : " All you are doing is tumbling head over heels over unproved fields , and you 're losing your sanity in the progress . All your arguments are inhuman and impractical . " " Oh , are they ! " Renzel argued hotly . " In other words you are in earnest . You are perfectly satisfied to compromise , and even now , when our danger is so evident , to stop at these halfway stations . How can you do that , and have your eyes open ? Ca n't you see that German fascism and our own so-called democratic capitalism differ only in degree ? And it 's no longer tenable to try to differentiate between degrees ; not when you see them gradually fusing . And in the meanwhile fascism not only dictates its terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below . But I suppose you do n't care about that . You do n't care that it crushes , seeps in and sucks us dry ? That it definitely tries to stultify all reaction toward it ? Dear God , Ernst , with so much at stake , how can you be so blind and so obtuse ? " He was very earnest now ; in fact , Ernst realized that he was practically pleading with him . For a little while he softened toward his younger brother . He tried to take the sting out of his next question , putting the  | words much more carefully than he had originally planned them : " All right then , if all you say is true , what do you propose to do , now that our danger is supposed to be so imminent ? " " I do n't know , " Renzel said honestly . " And that 's the trouble . I 'm afraid it 's definitely too late . What has happened and is happening in Austria , Czechoslovakia , Poland , Finland is a continuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it can be stopped . At this stage only force can stop it . But of what good is force in a small , helpless nation like ours ? " Troubled , he stood still , casting his eyes wearily over the landscape , his young voice full of doom . " And so few people seem to be able to see it . I do n't know why . It 's so clear , so awfully clear . And then some people who do see it , just lose themselves in scholastic arguments about Naziism . They say it ca n't be abidingly dangerous , because it has no real basic principles . That it is a hodgepodge of medievalism , anti-Semitism , nineteenth-century chauvinism , cynicism , paganism , Machiavellianism , and all for very crude and cruel ends . Of course , that 's right . But in the meanwhile it is working , and preparing to crush all the civilized world . " Ernst touched his arm . " Come on , " he said . " We 're on the way to Uncle Moente 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind . " Renzel walked along with Ernst again , as if he were hardly aware of him . " Because , " he was saying , " after fascism has destroyed all existing social orders , it wo n't have anything abiding to put in their place , nothing humanly abiding . And so eventually it will disappear , but in the meanwhile ? Oh , God , " he groaned . " And to think that even the working classes ca n't see that . The ones who will have to suffer the most , and who are the only ones left to save us . . . . " Ernst was n't answering him any longer . The argument had gone beyond his interest . But he let Renzel talk , waiting for some concrete argument , something personal that he himself could  | take hold of , perhaps something in connection with this woman in Amsterdam with whom Renzel was having this affair . Vaguely he heard Renzel say : " . . . but now the only thing that can stop Hitler is something or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe Russia . But in the meanwhile we 'll go under . " " Do n't sound so much like an epitaph , " Ernst said facetiously , trying to lead him off his subject . But Renzel shook his head glumly . " Why do n't you come down to earth ? " he cried . " It 's so simple to understand , because there is only one thing you need know , and that is that the capitalistic system , wherever it is still functioning , is rapidly becoming obsolete . And nothing is going to take up the cudgels for it , nothing strong and sane , because it has betrayed the common people and sold its own birthright to the enemy . Why ? Because it knows it is defeated , and now simply seeks to eke out something for its own selfish use . And everybody else becomes the victim of that defeatism and that treachery . Look around you here in Holland . Look at both our working class and our intellectuals . See how they 've rallied behind this pious Colijn government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to answer that question , because everybody 's become hysterical , and in their panic they 'd rather submit themselves to some local brand of Wehrwirtschaft , which makes complete demands on their souls and bodies , than to face the real issues " Is that the way you sit and talk to this heartthrob of yours you are hiding somewhere in Amsterdam ? " Ernst demanded meanly . Renzel looked at him steadily for a moment . " At least , " he said slowly , " she knows much better than you what nonsense it is to go humbly obeying the demands of our own present reactionary government . " " And is that her wonderful attraction for you ? " Ernst persisted .  | " Do n't talk of things you ca n't possibly know anything about , " Renzel said sharply . But he knew he was n't going to air his views any longer . And though he had been strengthened by his own arguments , he felt suddenly very heavyhearted . He should be with Leenie . Now , because the years ahead of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his own brother made him feel empty and forsaken . He felt as if he had to talk again , but the words seemed to die within him . But I am so right , so right , he thought . But here talking to his brother , he felt his own emotional immaturity rising up against his convictions . He was extremely impatient with Ernst now , hardly realizing that Ernst was primarily pumping him about Leenie . But his relationship with her had become such a sequestered , such an almost sacred matter , that he did n't even conceive of any need of talking about it to Ernst . For the rest of the way to Haveland they did not speak to each other again . It was a relief to both , after they had crossed the last cross dike , to sec the large sprawling farmstead lying there securely behind its moat . Even the sun broke through the scudding clouds momentarily . Someone obviously had already noticed their approach . Someone in uniform . Oh , Gerrit Oosterveert , of course , Renzel thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cantonment yesterday afternoon with the first group to go home on their week-end furlough . He and Gerrit had so little in common that they saw very little of each other . Now the young father was coming up the dike steps to meet them . He shook their hands formally and handed them each an expensive-looking cigar . Then he remained standing in front of them , saying confusedly : " Well , of course , the womenfolks saw you coming . Well , so I ? " he laughed nervously ? " well , do n't mind me . I had a drink or two , and everything . . . " He stopped , grinning hopefully up at them . Somehow Renzel felt sorry for him , but Ernst was already  | shaking Gerrit 's hand importantly and congratulating him on the birth of a son . But he 's only a boy , he seems even younger than I am , Renzel thought worriedly , finding himself then shaking Gerrit 's hand without being able to think of one word to say in congratulation . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry the burden of the conversation . And Ernst , who from the top of the dike had looked upon his uncle 's lands and already visualized them as neat geometrical bodies of water dissected precisely by the narrow auxiliary dikes , gave now no hint in his bantering conversation that he knew his uncle would be one of the very first to be affected when the order came to evacuate the river lands . While he kept chattering to Gerrit , he tried to come to a decision as to whether he 'd even tell Uncle Moente about it . Doubtless the man knew . . . " So of course , unsocial and impractical Renzel here , " he was saying , " thought he could just go skipping this momentous occasion , till I pointed out otherwise . After all , your son is our second cousin , so we ought to have a share in the glory , too . " Gerrit only bobbed his head , more abashed by all this " city " politeness than by Renzel 's silence . " Moente , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially to these cousins by marriage , " well , Moente is expecting you in his little office . He said maybe you 'd like a quick one before you faced all the women . " " Now that 's an idea , " Renzel said enthusiastically , because Gerrit 's bashful words had unwittingly conjured up such an accurate picture of his uncle at his caustic best . " Just lead us to him , " he added more familiarly , grinning at Gerrit . Even as they crossed the yard , the evidences were plentiful that the entire house had been given over to the women , for the very feminine occasion of the child 's birth . The house was literally filled with women , friends and neighbors , free from the censorious eyes of their husbands till evening at least , according  | to the custom of the region . Their voices sounded everywhere , their faces seemed to be peering from all the windows , and signs of their activities were upon all things . But before any of them emerged from the house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come on inside , " he said . " We can do the handshaking there , and say all the fancy words . Both of you need warming up inside after that walk over the dike . Besides , you have a whole battalion of women to face , and with you decked out in those soldiers ' outfits , well , it calls for internal bravery . " But Renzel , looking at his uncle , thought : He does n't look at all well , he looks tired and pale ; and that in spite of the fact that he must already have had a drink or two , and is unusually garrulous . Mocnte , seeming to feel Renzel 's scrutiny , said almost too jocosely to Gerrit : " Conic , son , it is n't safe to leave you here alone . They 'll surely cone out and pounce on you . " Gerrit followed willingly enough , but once they were all in Moente 's little office , he sat down by the window and stared dreamily out . " It 's almost too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forcedly . " Well , it is supposed to be a pretty virile and heroic deed , becoming a father , " Ernst commented . " You 'd be surprised how little it takes out of you , " Moente countered , in his customary low , sardonic voice . There 's nothing the matter with him ; I must be imagining things , Renzel decided , grinning at his uncle . But he saw that Ernst did n't quite approve of Moente 's last remark . " I called you in here for a drink , because I did n't dare to stop there in the yard and apologize for what I have to offer you . You see , the women have confiscated all the brandy , and have raisins soaking in it by the pound all over the house . And then they came and took most of my gin ? " he stopped to cough , and then added engagingly ? " they did n't even leave me any for  | cough medicine , and I seem to be needing some . Anyway they 're sipping my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toasts every time some one giggles or the baby lets out a scream . So all I can offer you is some anise-gin , a woman 's drink , which the women themselves despise on this great occasion . " " Well , here 's to the army and may they keep the land dry and free , " he offered a toast then to the three young men in uniform , his voice suddenly becoming serious . But in the middle of the toast , Gerrit slipped out of the room , his eyes looking faraway and abstracted . " Poor boy , " Moente added , " I wonder sometimes if it is n't just as well getting all excited over becoming a father or something like it , instead of seeing your doom coming closer and closer . " " Oh , it is n't as bad as all that , " Ernst said consolingly . " We 'll see , " Moente answered . " At any rate that is n't for us to brood about today . Today fate has given us an occasion with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe . " Renzel bobbed his head in instant agreement . " So let 's drink . So let 's drink a lot , " he grumbled almost angrily . Then they sat down again , and Renzel , looking at his uncle , thought : He 's a fine man , and I like him . I always thought I could . . . Even now while Moente was saying to them , almost wistfully : " So it was a boy , my first grandson . And nobody seemed to know what his name was going to be , because it seems that Liesbet had never even consulted Gerrit about the name . But ? " his voice was actually turning softer now , and even Ernst showed his approval ? " but when Liesbet opened her eyes and knew it was a boy , she said to me : His name is Moente , of course . ' And she shook my hand as if it was a business deal between us . Well , strange as it may seem , it got me . It sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she lay , trying to perpetuate my name in a world that 's about to go under . And somehow I could n't joke about it . Somehow it seemed to go inside of me , and make me stand still to look at myself here in  | the midst of life . And I did n't want her to know that I felt that way . I only wanted her to see my gratefulness . " " Of course , " Renzel said , leaning forward . " Yes , of course . " Moente smiled ruefully , recovering himself immediately . " Well that was all I wanted to show her , and it became easy then . Because there , right on the spot , Vogeltje 's mother had a tantrum , insisting on consulting Gerrit before the child was named . And Vogeltje herself first sided with her mother , then with Liesbet , then somehow turned against us all . . . And all because of a name . And yet , I want that boy to be called Moente . I want it to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . Even if its last name is Oosterveert . Well , as I said , it made an issue out of simple name calling , and it made it easier for me to hide what I really felt . It made it even easy for me to put that old trouble-making woman in her place , till she retired to her own chair singing some blood-curdling psalm about God smiting her enemies . And in her excitement she was singing five or six notes ahead of her zither accompaniment . . . Well , all that somehow brought everything down to earth again . " He shook his head slowly , looking at each of them in turn . " I 'm afraid I 'm talking too much , " he said then , only looking at Renzel now , who did not smile politely when he looked at him as Ernst did . " Of course you 're not , " Renzel said , full of conviction . But then Gerrit came back , his coat awry and his hair disheveled , and Moente filled the glasses again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Moente thought : Now why did I tell them that ? It means nothing to anybody but myself . Then , looking at Gerrit , he said suddenly aloud : " You see , like Gerrit , I 'm pretty sentimental , too . " But I did n't mean to say that , he scolded himself . Gerrit blushed and unbuttoned his coat . Ernst , to whom this mixed show of sentiment and irony on the part of his uncle seemed in bad taste , started talking about the engineering corps.  | No one seemed very attentive , and Moente interrupted him to ask about Daverdam , and then , after one more round of drinks , they found themselves ready to face the women . Liesbet beamed approval at Renzel , cousinly respect at Ernst . Then , looking at her husband , she took hold of his hand , and he started to cry a little . " Better put him to bed for a while , Father , " she said maternally . " He 's pretty well under the weather , and he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight . " But then , looking critically at Moente , she scolded him : " You ought to be in bed yourself , Father . Honest . " She turned to Renzel and Ernst , pleadingly : " He has a fever right now , I can tell . All week he 's been running a temperature . We 've been trying to keep him in bed , but he just laughs it off , saying he 's having my birth pains for me , or something . . . But I know he 's sick . " She looked at her father again , troubled . Then I was right , Renzel thought . But he did n't know what to say . And when Moente said : " Ah , child , you are feverish yourself . Just forget about me . Besides , " and his voice turned suddenly serious , " how foolish it would be for me to get into bed and have some fancy illness , in times like these , when anything can happen , any moment . " But he stopped abruptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky . As if to save her father from further embarrassment , Liesbet showed them her baby then . The child looked like any new baby , Renzel thought , but his uncle 's words kept echoing through his head . So he recognized it , too , the danger , the inevitability of it , the . . . But then Liesbet demanded his attention , by reminding him playfully that his worst ordeal still lay ahead of him : meeting her old grandmother . And then Tante Vogeltje came in , more affable and talkative than he 'd ever seen her . Her eyes had a strange sheen and her cheeks a high color . The drinks , he suspected , watching her shake Ernst 's hand weightily , and listen to his polite words as if her life depended on them . Then with great officiousness she picked up the baby  | and laid it in another spot , two inches away from the first one . Suddenly everything seemed very feminine and topsy-turvy to Renzel ; this whole Haveland world ; no wonder Uncle Moente had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Vogeltje turning on him said pleasantly : " Well , well , I see Moente has already fortified you . And to hear that laugh , I guess life must have taken a turn for the better , even for you . " " Well , I guess for about five minutes it has , Tante Vogeltje , " he grinned . " Tante Vogeltje , " she mimicked his high-Dutch . But she looked at him more fondly than she 'd ever done in her life , and then she actually straightened the collar of his coat , saying sharply , as if to counteract the sentimental action of her hands : " I ca n't stand to sec a soldier looking sloppy . After all , what are you a soldier for ? " " You better get started on Gerrit then , " he laughed . " Look at him . " Vogeltje looked at her son-in-law , but both became embarrassed simultaneously , so that Vogeltje rushed out of the room again on a pretended errand . Ernst was now carrying on a solemn discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left to do but leave the bedroom and face all the female company in the living room . The old woman , seeing them come into the room , buried her face dourly in her open Bible , and when they came to shake hands with her , snapped the book shut with a gesture which indicated that they had most seriously interrupted her . But two empty glasses beside her , with a few remnants of raisins in them , showed that she had also been participating in the festivities . " Seems to me , " she barked at Moente , over Ernst 's shoulder , " that they 'd keep these soldiers where they 're needed . This is no place for them . " " Oh , I do n't know , " Moente answered smoothly . " If all you  | women keep on sipping more boere-jonges , I might have to call out a riot squad soon . Meanwhile the soldiers will do . " She did not deign to smile back at him , and studied Ernst 's uniform critically . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , when he remained standing politely near her . " Come , boys , " Moente commanded , ushering them away to meet the other women . An hour later dinner was served , and twenty-nine people sat down to it . Nothing that was said made much sense . Even Ernst realized that for once he 'd had several drinks too many . We 're sitting here , drowned people banqueting beneath fourteen feet of water , he calculated uneasily , projecting himself into the future . He shut off the vision , because the waters started swirling and he was alone .. . " Feasting with the handwriting already upon the wall , " he said sarcastically to Renzel beside him , making a joke at Renzel 's expense out of his own terror . Renzel looked at him critically for a moment and then said : " Of course , " and went on eating . All through the dinner the women kept making a great to-do over the young father , who sat propped straight in his chair beside Moente . They filled him with food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to return to camp . Was n't it fortunate now that Liesbet 's cousins had come , so that they 'd be able to take care of him ? Gerrit grinned fatuously at Ernst and Renzel , stumbled to his feet , and shook hands with them across the table . That called for another toast , but Moente slipped an innocuous non-alcoholic cordial into Gerrit 's hand . " Steady a little , Son , " he said . " Yes , Father , " he answered obediently , realizing then that it was the first time he 'd called Moente Father in public . After the lengthy dinner was over , they piloted Gerrit to the hay in the barn , out of the women 's way . He fell asleep almost at once . Seeing him lying there asleep , they kept sitting silently  | near , Moente thinking about the future , Renzel thinking about Leenie , even Ernst too full of food and drink to feel like making conversation . They sat there , three silent sentinels watching over the young , utterly oblivious father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once in the train , Gerrit proved to be more manageable than they had expected . Away from the farm and all the sentimental attentions of the women , he seemed to recapture a little of his self-respect ; still , he , the father , was definitely the child of the three . Fortunately there seemed little need of making conversation . Ernst made a few attempts , but his polite banter flip-flapped with broken wings against Renzcl 's disinterest and Gerrit 's amiable vagueness . But when they reached Doesburg , they found that they had several hours to wait for the army trucks which would take them to their respective camps . Gerrit insisted on buying them drinks , timidly daring them to refuse . Renzel did n't care . Any number of drinks seemed welcome now , now that Sunday was almost over , now that he had n't seen Leenie . Soon Gerrit was drunk again . There were scores of other soldiers in the saloon . Gerrit wanted to tell them all about his son and buy them drinks , but Ernst restrained him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inept Colijn government . Hearing him , Ernst said sharply : " Keep you mouth buttoned up until you know what you 're talking about . " Renzel waved him away , saying almost affably : " Oh , go away . You 're my brother in only a few minor aspects . " " You 're drunk , " Ernst said . " Yes , thank you , " Renzel answered . " Yes , thank you , " Gerrit echoed . And then the trucks came for the soldiers of Renzel and Gerrit 's cantonment . Taking Gerrit 's arm efficiently , Renzel piloted him to his truck . He did n't look back at Ernst again , and he did n't say good-by . And so they parted , as if total strangers .  | Troubled , Ernst stood aside and watched the trucks disappear down the road . Then he walked back to his table in the saloon , and said bitterly to the soldier Renzel had been arguing with : " You 'd think he 'd keep his mouth shut , " because his conscience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least that he 'd watch his drinking . " The soldier looked at him long and bleakly . " What 's the matter , you piss-willy ? " he sneered then . " Ca n't you bear to see your own brother having a little fun ? "  | CHAPTER X111 IT WAS SUNDAY AGAIN , AND KATRIEN WAS keeping watch beside her grandfather , while Grandmother , Mother , and Dirkie went to church . For a little while Mijnheer Haming had been napping , sitting in his chair with the batik cloth over his face . Now he pulled the cloth petulantly away , crying anxiously : " Katrien , Katrien . " When he saw her sitting there beside him , he added apologetically : " It was that dream again . That dream . They had come , and they were murdering us , and I heard their marching feet , and then the house started sagging apart . " " It 's all right , Opoe , " Katrien said consolingly . " See how quiet everything is ? And the sun coming out ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she seated herself a little closer to him . It was largely her fault that he was this way , especially afternoons , when horror seemed to come stalking into his customary naps . It is my fault , she accused herself in bitter repentance , recalling that awful afternoon of his first heart attack , when she 'd so hysterically told him about Hans .. . " What time is it now ? " Mijnheer Haming asked in an exhausted voice , playing on her sympathy . " It is only a little after three . " " Are n't they ever coming out of church ? " he grumbled unreasonably , putting his hand over his heart , to see if this almost completely feigned querulousness of his had any effect on it . When he realized that Katrien had n't answered , he added more  | aggrievedly : " And Renzel , is n't he here yet ? Why is n't he here ? Did n't Ernst write that Renzel 's furloughs started on Saturday afternoons ? Well , then , where is he ? " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and anxiously he lowered his voice , and piteously he reached for the girl 's hand . Besides , he realized suddenly , if he acted up too much now , he might not be allowed to go with Mevrouw Haming on their spring tour of inspection to the property they leased to tenants . At the moment , he dreaded that disappointment most , so he started to smile sorrowfully at Katrien , and mumbled : " It 's all right , girl . This old heart , it does seem to make me slightly nasty . " Katrien , who had been searching for a diplomatic answer in regard to Renzel , said in great relief : " Oh no , Opoe , you 're not nasty at all . " It had been a mean trick of Ernst 's she decided , to give Renzel 's secret away . Of course , they 'd all guessed that Renzel spent most of his furloughs in Amsterdam , with someone . . . but Ernst had actually hinted in his letter that there might be something unsavory in Renzel 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . well , at any rate it was a dirty trick for Ernst to play . And she had not yet forgivdn him for having taken such righteous umbrage about her awful experience with Hans . She had only told him because she 'd needed advice and consolation , and above all sympathy , but he had in a schoolmasterly fashion talked to her about the correct behavior of girls , and the horrible effect of scandals . . . It served him right that they kept his engineering corps so busy that he could seldom come home Sundays now . That insured , in turn , Renzel 's coming , now that Ernst was n't here to drive him to distraction . . . " What are you thinking about , so heavily , Katrien ? " her grandfather demanded , gently stroking her hair . She smiled bravely at him . " Oh , just life . Somehow it does n't seem so pleasant any more , not the way it used to be , " she confessed .  | " There now , there now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , and perhaps very soon ? " But he stopped , for suddenly the ogre of approaching war confronted him . This unreal Sunday quiet was fooling him ; the girl 's adolescent problems were blinding him ? " Is n't there any news at all over the radio ? " he demanded . " You know there is so little on Sundays , Opoe , " she said , knowing that she had to keep all exciting news from him . " Then run to your side of the house and see if Renzel has n't come yet . It 'd be just like him to forget to come up here , and sit there alone moping . There must be someone who can tell me something . Something must be happening . " " Now you 're working yourself up again , " she said accusingly . Immediately he quieted down , and as he looked at her , his eyes became frightened . " Yes , " he said tonelessly . " But do go and see if Renzel has come . Like a nice girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She grinned forgivingly at him and got up and walked slowly toward the stairs , not yet certain what she 'd say to Renzel if he was there . " You must n't say anything about it to Renzel , " Mother had commanded , referring to her quarrel with Hans . " Never , because Renzel takes those things so seriously . " And yet , in many ways , it seemed to be Renzel and no one else who could answer her . Renzel who had always been the uncertain one , the harried one , exactly the way she 'd been feeling all these last weeks , as if somehow the ground under her feet was n't safe any longer . Softly she descended the stairs , more softly and more slowly she crossed the passage to their own side of the house , pushing the door warily open . She was certain now that he had come home . Somehow all her senses told her , though she did n't hear him , and she did n't smell cigarette smoke . Then she saw him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so peaceful , as she 'd never seen him . Or had she never looked upon him  | while he slept ? But it was n't that . . . She tiptoed toward him , and stood very near him , all her being flooded with great pity for him , because he lay there asleep with his own peace . Of course I have n't any right to bother him with my silly troubles , she thought . You see , she said to herself , he 's in love , and someone 's in love with him , or he could n't lie there like that as if nothing troublesome could ever touch him again . She smiled ruefully down on him , as if she were much older than he , as if she ought to stay there to watch that no evil would befall him . Because . . . because ... a grave voice whispered unreasonably but with terrible conviction inside of her . . . because he has so little time left to sleep like this . . . She put her hand over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own lips and she was trying to keep it from saying what should n't be said . She stood very still , and wanted to cover him with something . But if she covered him , he might wake up . Now there were tears in her eyes , and she felt very foolish and very gentle and very tragic . Then she hurried softly out of the room , and closed the door quietly upon him . She tiptoed up the stairs to her Grandfather again . And she was grateful when she saw that he , too , had fallen asleep . She thought , now I do n't have to say to him : " No , Opoe , Renzel has n't come home yet . " Now she could sit down at the window , cuddling close to the truth of Renzel 's sleeping . Iler eyes rested upon the Sundaydrowsy city . Her mind lulled itself upon a portentous melancholy , a foreboding in which she had no right to believe , ever ... After dinner , Renzel decided to go calling on Margariet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had had a pleasant nap on the settee till the family had come from church and had awakened him . Then they 'd had tea upstairs with the  | old folks , and Grandfather had questioned him diligently about everything pertaining to the army and the entire European situation . And then later , somehow very unexpectedly , while they were returning to their own side of the house again , his mother had stopped him on the stairway and said : " Now , Renzel , do n't you think you could bring your friend in Amsterdam home with you some Sunday ? I really would like to meet her . " For a few disturbed moments he had n't been able to answer , and then he 'd said : " Well , I 'll ask her . " But he knew , of course , that it was impossible . However , he seemed to feel no immediate urgency to come to terms with himself about this new problem . It seemed oddly unimportant , strangely apart , even unanswerable . He reached Mathijs ' and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to do next , he walked on , crossing every bridge he came upon , zigzagging wherever his fancy might lead him . IIe was n't particularly heavy with thoughts , as he usually was ; in fact , he felt oddly contented as he strolled through the Sunday-peaceful streets . But I ) averdam , in spite of its thirty thousand people , was compact and had no sprawling suburbs . Too much so , he decided when for the third time he came upon the fringes of Celebes Park , where the first brass band of spring was valiantly holding forth to a group of listeners who kept strolling around the bandstand , since it was still too cool to sit down on the benches . It had been I loffrnann 's " Barcarole " the first time Renzel had approached the park , then Brahms ' " Wiegenlied , " now some sort of martial music . Rather than cross the park , he turned and walked toward the old northern ramparts , a section of the town where he was practically a stranger . From stoops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city ended abruptly outside the old four-towered gate , beyond which stretched only fields crisscrossed by peaceful roads and evening-lighted canals . Along the roads went cyclers . For a little while he stood under the gate , watching them , reminding himself then that it must have been  | Ernst who had told his mother about his " friend in Amsterdam . " It annoyed him , and suddenly , too , the complacent fields outside the town irritated him . Slowly he walked toward the ramparts which stretched to the old Zuider Zee dike and the old harbor tower . Then he climbed the crumbling steps of the ramparts , but he had no eyes for the red , evening-bathed town beneath him , even though he rested a while at one of the old bastions , peering out , seeing nothing , hearing only the waning sounds , the lost voices . . . What , he wondered , had Katrien suddenly begun trying to tell him ? Something about a beau of hers . But equally suddenly she had decided not to say anything , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked on again and when he reached the dike and the heavy tower upon it , he decided to climb toward the old tower 's only unruined bastion and look out toward the Zuider Zee grain fields , already flawless green with winter wheat . But there was someone already there , he realized , climbing the ruined steps , just rounding the corner with the gargoyle which seemed to be retching , perpetually . When he reached the top platform , he realized that it was Vladimir Goessen who stood there leaning over the parapet , gazing down upon the green dike . Vladimir did n't seem to notice him , and Renzel wondered what to say to the silent man , who only last fall had tried to commit suicide and failed . Now even the fisherfolk shunned him , and old fishwives wagged their heads portentously at the mere mention of his name . Renzel felt like an intruder , and was about to slip away again when Vladimir turned and nodded to him . Then he joined the man on the half-ruined little balcony and said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silently for a little while , his gray eyes probing . " Oh , yes , Renzel , " he said then briefly . And Renzel was surprised that Vladimir knew his name . He put his arm on the wall , beside Vladimir 's , and also peered  | down upon the slope of the dike . Then he saw what had held the man 's attention . Beneath them , on the sea side of the dike , in the late western light , sat one of those young German tourists , drawing in a sketchbook , drawing the precisely geometrical reclaimed land that stretched before him and ended at the new high dike now being constructed beyond the island . Vladimir , aware now that Renzel was seeing what he had wanted him to see , turned toward him , saying dryly : " Well , you see what he 's doing . Perhaps he personally is n't accomplishing anything . But it 's the intention behind it , and if anybody knows , I know . " " Yes , yes ? " Rcnzcl said , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry eyes . " But they let them do it . Day after day . Hundreds of them , each doing his little part . And nobody raises a hand . What do they think he 's doing , just drawing pretty pictures ? " Vladimir 's words were bitter now , cold like metal . Renzel stared up at him , sensing the man 's violent anger . Of course , Vladimir was right , but that zeal behind his words and that hatred in his eyes seemed more personal than this occasion demanded . Now he seemed only to be demanding that Renzel agree with him , unconditionally and righteously . As if he had long needed a witness for his anger , and now that he had found one , he would not let him go . Somehow Renzel realized that Vladimir expected even more of him  --  but not words , not protests . " It 's an outrage , " he answered angrily , as if he had been infected by the man 's anger alone . " And here , here right in the midst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searchingly . At last he said : " But you ca n't know what I know , what I hear and see . You would n't believe ? " He fell abruptly silent . It 's his mother , of course , Renzel told himself . But then why does n't he tell people . Why ? And was that perhaps the reason he 'd tried to drown himself in his heavy boots , that day Germany had in-  | vaded Poland ? He looked at Vladimir with renewed interest , seeing him now staring down upon the German again , seeing his hands cramping angrily over the stone ledge . And then he saw him looking around , fixing his eyes on one of the heavy gray bricks lying at his feet . Again he stared at Renzel , again as if he asked only that Renzel should be his witness . Then he stooped and picked up the brick . Renzel watched him , bereft of all action . He simply stepped back , so as to watch all the proceedings more accurately , as if Vladimir had hypnotized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prevent something , something which should remain theory but never become an act , because man 's deeds  --  ridiculous , because it sounded like such an outmoded argument ? should only be good . But Vladimir was lifting the brick , was now weighing it in his hand , was then lifting his powerful arm slowly above the parapet . And still Renzel watched dumbly , his eyes now riveted on the brick . And then the arm swung , and the heavy brick hurtled from the hand , down upon the young German . Because at that very moment Renzel had rushed to the edge and was looking over . It was a well-aimed throw , and yet everything seemed to be trancelike , slow . Why ? He still wanted to do something , even now that it was much too late . The startled shriek of the young German reached him , he saw the fellow topple forward . Then the sketchbook fluttered away , down the dike slope , and the boy  --  he seemed only a boy , he realized painfully  --  stared up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in outraged surprise .. . Then the young German pushed the palms of his hands against his bloody face . And then at last , as if he were a crushed caterpillar , he curled up , and lay still . And Renzel only stared down ... He felt Vladimir 's hand roughly on his shoulder : " Come away , you idiot . Do you want to be seen ? " " No , " he gasped , knowing that the German had seen him .  | " No , " and mechanically he started following Vladimir down the steps , faster and faster until they were running noisily by the time they reached the bottom gate . There Vladimir restrained him and peered out to see if anyone was coming . On the dike they could hear voices , and someone clattered by on wooden shoes . " This way , " Vladimir said . And again Renzel followed , keeping pace , while all his insides seemed to have curdled in him . But Vladimir had done the just thing . Then why ? why , when words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now they were running no longer , but were slipping stealthily along the sea side of the ramparts , along a forsaken path winding through eelgrass and clumps of old mussel shells . Above them people peered down from the ramparts , or strolled along , talking leisurely . In the west the sun had slipped away , and shadows were deepening . " This way , " Vladimir said again , and now they were walking down one of the narrow , disreputable streets of back-harbor town , past vacant buildings , cheap hotels , saloons , and a high fence scribbled all over with obscenities . He had n't been here since he was a boy , Renzel thought . Grown-up , civilized people did n't come here , a voice seemed to tell him , smugly . It almost seemed like Ernst 's voice . But once this had been a flourishing , though always rowdy section , when  --  when everything that now was lost had been alive . Of course , he told himself , Vladimir was well acquainted with this neighborhood ; somewhere here must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eel nets and all his other equipment . Still he followed obediently , in silence . He wanted to rebel , but curiosity was getting the better of him . Why was he obeying this man ? This unfortunate fanatic , this  --  why was he following him now without protest into an evil-looking water-front saloon , where Vladimir shut the door carefully behind them ? There were only three customers inside , two men and a rawlooking blonde woman . Another fat and extremely filthy woman  | waited behind the bar . She did n't come to their table after they had seated themselves , but , taking a tin can with a geranium out of the window , she pulled a ringed and spotted curtain down , and then shouted at them , asking what they wanted . Vladimir ordered a pernot for each , and then looked at Renzel long and thoughtfully . " I think you 'd better not mention what you saw . " " All right , " he answered simply . " But why did you do it ? " " It had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained silent when the woman brought them their drinks and held out a grubby hand for the money . From the other table the blonde woman appraised them silently ; the two men were talking in undertones . But Vladimir did n't say anything else . He sat back , his eyes withdrawn , his entire bearing unapproachable . The hand that had thrown the brick was now cupped heavily around the glass . " Yes , I guess it had to be done , " Renzel said at last . " Only it surprised me . I did n't seem to be prepared for it , it seemed somehow ? " But he stopped confusedly , confronted by Vladimir 's grim staring . " Why should it surprise you ? " Vladimir demanded . " You , you yourself , in that uniform ? " he wagged his finger derisively at Renzel ? " you should have done it . But you would n't have , and that 's why I had to . Because it 's my duty , it 's been my duty a long time . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to . They brought me back so I had to live . And there 's only one way I can keep on living , that is to avenge all the wrong that 's been done to me . It used to be that I only had to avenge myself on my own mother , because she 's cheated me out of my birthright , because all my life 's she 's treated me as a stumbling block , treated me like dirt . . . Why ? Because she is dirt herself , she 's evil , she 's corrupted everything she 's touched , but because I was there  --  and it seems I was there just for that purpose  --  she 's always taken it out on me . She deprived me of my father , she  | whored around with other men while I was there in the same house to watch her whorings . She killed that other bastard of hers , she ? " He stopped suddenly . His words had been coming dryly , hoarsely , and all the time he had looked past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared at Renzel , mutely , and at last he said : " But you would n't know , young fellow , you  --  well , you 're happy and normal , and ? But now it 's even more than I just told you . I should n't have told you that : that 's my personal problem . I should have told you only this : I love this country , because she hates it , and when I see her spying , see her helping those damned Germans to spy on us , my fight is not only with her , but her whole damned race , with all those Nazis . . . . And so I keep waiting . I keep thinking , now I 'll do it , now I 'll strike , now I 'll show all the world . . . And then . Well , then I find myself sitting back saying to myself : Not yet , Vlam . Not yet . Give her and her schemes a little more time , and then ? ! ' But I may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wagged his head grimly and stared piercingly at Renzel . " Why do n't you get out of this dirty hole ? Why do n't you go home ? " Then he seemed to repent of what he 'd said . He extended his big hand across the table , and waited till Renzel had put his hand in it . " Forget it , will you ? Just forget it . But I think you 'd better go home now , any time now . I 'm going to stay here . " " Yes , " Renzel said , feeling Vladimir 's hand fold around his , viselike , seeing the man 's eyes boring into his . " Yes , I think I 'll go home . Yes , Vladimir . " He pronounced the name slowly , as if with difficulty . " Yes , I 'll forget it . " He pulled his hand free and stumbled to his feet . But he did not go till Vladimir had looked up at him again and nodded briefly . And still he waited , still expecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was lighting a kerosene lamp . The three people at the other table shifted a little , as if they wanted the light on their backs only , and continued talking .  | But then Vladimir nodded his head in the direction of the door . " And so ? " Vladimir said , dismissing him , bending his head over his drink . Then Renzel hurried toward the door . He walked confusedly down the forsaken miserable street , through the music of a wheezing accordion which stopped abruptly when he passed . It was almost dark , and the street lamps were infrequent , often broken , but he found his way back to the ramparts , and , hurrying through one of the gates , he crossed the bridge to the other side of the inner canal . From there he saw people on top of the dike , at the foot of the old tower . They were silhouetted against the western sky , they gesticulated , pointed . He could hear their voices , he could differentiate questions and answers by the intonation of those voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurried on , and turned into Court Without A Name . Adriana and Monette stood on their stoop , looking out toward the quay . " They say there was an accident , " they said to him when he passed . " I did n't see anything , " he answered . For a moment longer they eyed him silently , both smiling . Once , when he was nineteen he had gone to their house with an older friend . But Monette had said then : " You 'd better go home and to bed . You know we are neighbors . " It seemed a code he could only accept , and he had obeyed her , and at the door she had shaken his hand formally . And as Vladimir had done tonight , she had said : " And so But now he felt his own confusion increasing , so he hurried away from them . He walked even faster past the Goessen house , which lay in complete darkness and silence behind its fence . It was all true then , all the gossip about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why then did n't they stop her ? Why did n't he do something himself ? The questions darted confusedly through his mind , and no logical answer presented itself . When he reached the courtyard door , he found it bolted . He kicked at  | it , nervously , as if someone were actually pursuing him . He shouted , and his mother opened the door . " Oh , " she said , peering down the court , and seeing the two young women on their stoop in the glare of the street light , she asked , " Where have you been ? " " I just came from the quay . It seems there was an accident , " he said , watching her bolt the gate again . She did n't say anything else , and he followed her across the dark courtyard , but before she entered the house he asked abruptly : " Are there still some of those young German tourists staying with Vrouw Goessen ? Do n't you think there are a lot of them around ? " She whirled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that someone had told him about that affair with Hans , she asked sharply : " Why do you ask ? " Sensing her anxiety , and groping for the reason behind it , he stepped back , and for all the world he did n't know what to say next . Then he said lamely : " Because I think they 're dangerous . And something has to be done about it , " unconsciously echoing Vladimir 's words . She peered at him through the deep dusk . " That may be , " she said slowly . " That may be . . . " But she did n't finish , but hurried into the house instead . He followed her in . The next morning old Mevrouw Haming was kept busy for nearly an hour getting Mijnheer Haming ready  --  or doing it by gradual stages and maintaining the greatest possible appearance of casualness  --  for their trip to call upon their tenant farmers . She had tried to persuade him to stay at home , but because one of the pieces of property  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitedly accused her of trying to deprive him of his rights as a free citizen and responsible property owner . Much earlier that morning Renzel had returned to the border ,  | without a chance to tell them good-by . Then before she . had opened the shop , Margariet had come running over , saying that Mathijs had gotten orders to sail the next day . Also that someone had nearly killed one of those young German tourists by hurling a brick in his face , and that the police were investigating , but that all the fisherfolk along the quay refused to answer any questions , telling the police it was about time someone did something about those vile Germans . But there might be some nasty repercussions . . . She had had to keep warning Margariet to lower her voice , so that Mijnheer Haming should n't hear all this exciting news . And then the early mail had come , and in it had been another warning from the government about the danger of invasion and air attacks , giving a list of detailed instructions as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in case anything happened . Hastily she and Margariet had perused the list , and then they had silently looked at each other . " I 'll have to keep that list from your father , I 'm afraid , " Mevrouw Haming said at last . " And yet he should know , in case anything does happen . In case ? " She stopped , and watched Margariet , seeing her daughter 's hand tremble as she kept reading the list of instructions . Then Margariet looked up . " It 's coming closer , Mother , " she said bleakly . " And if it comes ? " She , too , left her sentence unfinished . " I 'll give the list to Dirkie . But I 'll wait till Mathijs is gone . I do n't want him to worry . And if anything happens , Dirkie will remember what to do much better than I will . He has practically memorized the first list , and the other day when I came home , he had filled the bathtub with water , and several buckets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he kept insisting that I remove all inflammable things from the attic , so finally I did . They tell them those things at school , and somehow it seems that the children are much better prepared than we older people . . . But then , who would want to do anything against an old defenseless city like Daverdam ? Just a city of pleasant houses and simple people , and who should want to do anything  | against them ? " Margariet stopped , and it seemed to her mother that she had simply stood there talking as if to convince herself . Troubled now , she looked at her mother for support . " That 's it , " Mevrouw flaming said slowly . " Every one thinks nothing will happen to his own quiet town or pleasant city . And only the children are realistic enough to know that something may happen . And we , we women , what do we do ? Like you and me , we try to keep the evil portents from our husbands . Why do we do that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she demanded querulously . " I suppose that 's it , " Margariet answered slowly . " And so a child like Dirkic becomes wiser than we . And so ? " But she stopped talking , shrugging her shoulders . " Has he left for school yet ? I mean Dirkie , " Mevrouw Haming demanded suddenly . " Because I think I would like to have him go with us to inspect the farms . I think , " she added contemplatively . " I think I need the little fellow . He could keep an eye on his Opoe  --  if you do n't mind keeping him out of school ? " " Of course not , " Margariet said . But they were both thinking a little ruefully about their dependence on the little boy . And then Mijnheer Haming started shouting from upstairs that the taxi had arrived . " I 'll hurry home and send Dirkie right over , " Margariet added , going toward the back door . Mevrouw Haming hurried upstairs and helped her husband into his greatcoat , even though the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us . He 'll love it , " she chattered brightly , afraid that he would be able to read her troubled thoughts about the approaching war . Because at that moment she was certain that war would come . Suddenly , too , she realized that it was her duty to talk about it with her tenants , to warn them . And for the first time she was grateful that she 'd never been able to induce her husband to leave the automobile on these trips . She 'd be able to talk to the tenants without upsetting him .  | Now , leading him carefully down the stairs , she was grateful that he always refused to leave the auto to be " nauseated " by barnyard smells . Grateful that he was deathly afraid of cows , which he imagined watched him with malicious intent across the swollen ditches . And how that used to irritate her ! " How can you possibly know what an absurd beast like that may get into its head ? And no mere ditch with a little water in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he had once told her . " Supposing , as a soldier , " she had appealed to his heroism , " you 'd be ordered to march through a herd of cattle ? " " Soldiers march against soldiers , not cows , " he 'd snorted indignantly . Now , too , she was grateful that he 'd never been a soldier . And grateful that he was old , almost grateful that his mind was starting to fail . Of late , however , many of his vagaries seemed to be motivated by toy-lead-soldier rules . And he , the weak , peaceful , and rather futile man , was becoming an old man full of mockheroics . Perhaps even that was for the best . It took the combined efforts of Gavel , the taxicab owner , and herself , to get Mijnheer Haming properly seated in the wide old cab , wrapping him in all available robes , and adjusting two pillows behind his back . Then suddenly she saw Dirkie coming toward them , actually running , actually in a hurry for once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way Mijnheer Haming greeted his little grandson  --  almost as if they were playmates , boys of the same age , she observed  --  the way his old face suddenly became flushed with excitement , was justification enough for having kept Dirkie out of school . But she said banteringly : " Dear me , I guess I 'm spoiling both of you . " A little ashamed of her duplicity , she sniffed suspiciously at Gavel 's breath . Fortunately , he had n't had a drink yet . " Remember , Gavel , " she said , " drive very slowly . " There were seven farms of her own to call at , and one of  | Hendrick 's . But all the property was close to Daverdam , so that they could easily be back by noon . " Because you 'll have to go to your afternoon classes , " she said conscientiously to Dirkie . " I suppose so , Omoe , " he answered dutifully , and then chuckled , because Grandfather had conspiratorily dug his elbow into his side , implying that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Opoe was having a wonderful time . But Mevrouw Haming hardly noticed . She was thinking about all her valuable properties instead . Luck had played such a leading role in obtaining and keeping them . Nevertheless she felt a direct responsibility toward her tenants , and there was nothing charitable about it . They seemed more like business partners ; her affairs flourished only because flourishing tenants were always assets . Now , as they slowly rode out of Daverdam 's last gate into the country , she realized that in another year , perhaps even in a month , nothing might be left in her control . And yet , while she still had control , her first responsibilities were to her living tenants , and only then , and secondarily , to the increasingly more hostile future . She was aroused by Hendrick , who was mischievously poking Gavel with his cane , actually poking it into the man 's fat red neck . Only then did she realize that the man was driving much faster than she had ordered . " Gavel , you fat-headed fool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mijnheer Haming shouted , his voice a strange mixture of fear and bravado . A sort of fragile bravado for Dirkie 's sake , so fragile that Hendrick could no longer sustain it . It was becoming terror now . " Stop that , " she said sharply . " Stabbing him with that cane wo n't do any good . " Petulantly Mijnheer Haming sagged back in his seat and closed his eyes . " There now , " she said soothingly to Dirkie . " If you notice that he 's going too fast again , just warn me . I 'm afraid I was dreaming . You see your Opoe simply ca n't get used to all this modern speed . "  | Mijnheer Haming opened his eyes indignantly , and , only addressing himself to Dirkie , grumbled : " It 's my asthma . This spring air , it 's foul . It 's full of stable odors . And the way it comes slapping at you , when he goes at that speed . I wo n't have it ! " Diplomatically Dirkie refrained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he recognized sagely , resolving to keep his grandfather in as good a humor as possible , so as to help Omoe , who seemed to be brooding heavily over something . It was his duty . For quite a while he succeeded . Omoe was sitting back thinking her own grave thoughts again , and he and Opoe had chattered about a number of things , when suddenly Opoe grabbed his arm and pointed at a road they were about to cross . It was an old dirt road winding between willows and hedges . " And that is our military highway ! " Opoe barked angrily . " That ! Why , any motorized division , even one tank going over it , would be hopelessly bogged in the mud . That 's how we 're prepared ! " But Hendrick , " Omoe protested , " that old lane does n't lead anywhere but to an old polder and bird sanctuary . " " That 's all you know about it , " he snapped . " I took the trouble to look it up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions upon millions on the upkeep of military roads . And look at it ! Look at it ! " Even Dirkie knew that the old man was utterly confused . He looked at his grandmother , a bit startled , and then he realized that she was n't going to contradict him . She only shook her head slowly , and said : " There now , there now . " Fortunately they were nearing the farm of the first tenants . I 'll have to show him those new photographs of the military highways on the eastern borders , she decided , because he may keep brooding over this . There , where there is real danger ; not here , beside a filled-in sea , outside an old and defenseless city . . . Suddenly she realized that Gavel was exceeding his speed again , as if getting away from that road was a good enough excuse .  | " Gavel , " she shouted , but he slowed to a stop in front of the tenant 's house and then turned an innocent face toward her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their gate to meet her , she kept still . She saw her husband shutting his eyes , pretending he was asleep so he would n't have to meet the farmer . Winking knowingly at Dirkie , she got out of the car to meet her tenants , whom she had already prepared several weeks in advance , announcing the exact date of her visit , and , as closely as possible , the exact hour . She walked between them up the yard and into the house , where over a cup of tea they could discuss all the necessary business . When she came back to the car , Hendrick and Dirkie were carrying on a fine conversation about America . Only when they neared the next tenant 's did Mijnheer Haming pretend sleep again . But at his own farm , she had to spend more time than anywhere else . After he 'd ascertained that the stork 's nest was still on its wagon wheel atop the roof , he refused to do anything else . The fartn had fallen into considerable disrepair during the severe winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truculent farmer and his wife . When she returned to the car , Hendrick refused to listen to her , pretending great weariness , groaning finally : " Now why did my mother have to leave me this awful farm that perpetually needs repairs ? I tell you , I simply have n't the time for it . I have more important things on my mind . " Addressing himself to Dirkie he added : " I have a good mind to give you the whole property , lad , stork 's nest and all . " They were now heading back toward the city , having traveled in a wide semicircle . Obediently Dirkie had stayed in the car with his grandfather , each time his grandmother had gotten out . But at the next and final stop he knew that he might come with her , because it was his favorite farm . Even the farmer and his wife expected it . Dirkie shook hands solemnly with Farmer Jochem and his wife , and then looked expectantly up the lane  | toward the house : " That 's right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You lead the inspection . You march ahead . " And the farmer 's wife wagged her head sentimentally over him , recalling her own child which had died . " But watch out for the dog . I just fed him a pound of liver and that makes him extra vicious . " Because that was part of the old ritual , too . So Dirkie preceded them all through the gate with its sign saying : " Beware of the angry dog , " never betraying by one gesture that all this was a fine game . Because next he led them toward a second , much smaller sign , closer to the house , a sign which read : " He only bites those who come with ill intent . " And a little farther beyond that sign lay a small painted castiron dog beside his cast-iron doghouse . Only then did Dirkie say gravely : " He 's in fine condition , Jochem . I shall commend you to the burgomaster . " Still , even in spite of this humorous little ritual , Mevrouw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to the car . It seemed that like a minor prophet she had proclaimed to all her tenants : " It 's later than you think . Do keep your eyes open , because I 'm afraid we 'll not be spared much longer . Every day we 're getting closer to war . And when it comes everything will be confusion and madness . " And so few of them had seemed to realize it . They had listened to her politely , perhaps irked a bit because she had shown less interest than usual in their immediate needs . It seemed to her that living there safely on their own farms , they felt no responsibilities toward anything else . For a while she sat in deep gloom beside her husband and grandson , hardly realizing that they had fallen silent , too . Suddenly she realized that Hendrick was asleep . She studied him ; he looked so frail , almost ethereal . She should n't let him sleep alone at night , unwatched . Even a dream could blow out so small a flame . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He  | opened his eyes at that moment and mumbled : " Now my feet are cold , and I smell farms , farms , farms . " " Cheer up , " she said . " We 're almost back in the city again . " But rain had started falling out of a shifting wind-driven mass of April clouds . It made him cough . Then he saw how close the towers of Daverdam were , and that worked miracles . But at that moment Mevrouw Haming said : " Hendrick , if we were even only five years younger , I 'd go to America . But now ? " She shook her head glumly , and did not go on . He regarded her suspiciously for a moment , and then largely for Dirkie 's sake he proclaimed : " America ? America ? And shirk our duty toward our country , toward our Queen ? " She ignored it . Then Daverdam was there , and over a gray bridge , then through the gray Brothers Gate , they rode into it . Rain slanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband started to watch his city which he loved more than anything else on earth . She looked upon it , too . Old and wet , incredibly placid , endlessly human , it had never bowed to any tyrant . It had shaken off all tyranny like a duck shaking off water . It had survived storms , plagues , evils , it had withstood pillage and invasion . It would do so again : even though as a city it was no longer extremely important , its elements were essentially and undyingly human . Its people only sought peace , ate their daily bread , and pursued their daily loves and their small ambitions . And so it could never perish , even though all its virtues were for the time being in disrepute . " Of course , " she said aloud , " I ought to have more faith . " And she found Dirkie looking up at her , seriously . It was a wet old town with its wet people pursuing their small needs . It would have to go on forever , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block to whoever had the temerity to conquer it . But in the meanwhile millions would die , unnecessarily . And a whole generation would be maimed , ravaged , and blotted out . That generation of people who now  | were young and healthy : Renzel , Mathijs , Ernst , Margariet , even Katrien perhaps  --  all of them . She seemed to see them now as in a vision . And somehow in a beam of light and hope , and alone and beyond them , Dirkie . And he was still so young , she thought , looking at the boy . And in the meanwhile ? " Oh , God help and sustain us , " she groaned inwardly , turning her face away from her husband and Dirkie . She was glad when the auto came to a stop before the house . She decided to go to the shop immediately , while Dirkie guided the old man upstairs where he could sleep off the fatigue of the trip . " And then you 'd better hurry home , boy , " she said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old familiar shop to compose herself . Wearily , longing for comfort , she pushed the shop door open , allowing herself to stand still on the threshold listening to the doorbell 's homely and benign jangling . Here is where I belong , she thought . I should n't ever stray from it too far . Now the familiar smells , cozily pungent , friendly  --  she stood there inhaling them . They seemed to fold her in securely , like very old , very trustworthy family retainers . Only then did she see Gezina look up from waiting on the one customer in the store . Gezina 's eyes met hers , and she realized that Gezina was upset . So it is n't yet the end , it is n't yet time for comfort , she realized , feeling her weariness assaulting her anew . She sat down behind the counter , waiting till the customer was gone . " It 's the news , " Gezina said . " I wanted to prevent Father from hearing it . His heart " What is it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she sat there steeling herself . " The Germans have taken Denmark , and they 're in Norway , " Gezina said . " And all further leaves have been canceled , and the Queen . . . "  | Folding her hands tightly in her lap , she listened . " I 'll go right upstairs , " she said when Gezina was through . " I think he 's too tired now to get really excited . So perhaps I 'd better tell him and get it over with . " But she realized that telling Hendrick was of secondary importance now . Looking at Gezina , she said : " Come here and sit beside me , girl , " making her voice strong . " Two sons , " Gezina said , choking , biting her lips against tears . " And Renzel so young , needing still so much . " She lapsed into silence , allowing her mother-in-law to press her hand . It did seem to give her strength . " And it was the Abrahams ' who told me , " she continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they were holding on to each other , supporting each other . But if my sons were in America , if only ? " She shuddered and closed her lips tightly . Then a customer carne in and they waited on her together . " Now you 'd better tell rather , " Gezina said then , calmly . Yes , she could leave Gezina now . And henceforth , too , Gezina would be able to calm herself , endlessly . She would have to , because weaker people would be needing her , because Gezina was that sort of a woman . A strong and calm woman , a woman of peace . She climbed the dark stairway wearily , coming to a stop halfway up , clutching the dark banister . But this was no time and no place to stop , standing there waiting for courage to come up with her . Standing there , waiting .. . She walked on again , hearing the sounds of the radio through the partition . Katrien must be having it on very loud . But Katrien would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbelievable what she heard , so terrible . That was like Katrien . " I must write to Moente , " she said aloud in the direction of the radio , her anxiety increasing , because Liesbet had written her that Moente had been in poor health all spring . " I must write him . " She found her husband stretched in his chair , the batik scarf  | covering his face , his cane and his shoes set beside him like sentinels . " Hendrick , " she said . " Yes , " he answered , but he did n't take the cloth off his face . " Hendrick , prepare yourself for some unwelcome news . " " Yes , " he said again , still not removing the cloth , but she saw his hand grope for his cane . She pushed the cane into his hand . " It came over the radio , while we were gone , " she started slowly . " It seems the Germans have taken Denmark and invaded Norway . They 've already taken Oslo . " But when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you listening ? " " Yes , I am , " his voice said sleepily from behind the exotic cloth . " But I do n't believe a word of it . How is it possible ? Besides , if it is true , it means they are not coming our way . But I 'm sleepy . " She stood very tall , looking down upon him in pity . But it was better so . Let it blur , and blend with his weariness . When later it would be told again to him , it would not be entirely new and startling . By then the tardy nerve ends would have prepared him a little . She tried to take the cane from his fingers , but he clutched it more firmly . He was awake . " I do n't believe it . I ca n't . I wo n't , " he muttered stubbornly . " Of course not , " she said matter-of-factly . " Of course not . It may be all propaganda . " Then she saw that he had fallen asleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife was telling him about an invasion . This dream that slyly would emerge as reality , and the delicate , quivering heart would be saved , because the rusty brain could not conceive the truth fast enough . And so the very old were better armored than the young , for such times as these . And if the very old did break in the end , it was of no consequence . Her heart bled for the young ; they 'd have to go on carrying their scars , so long . She took her husband 's cane and set it in a corner , wondering  | why she did n't leave it beside him . Then she spread a comforter over him . It seemed like the end of a long , hard day , and it was still early afternoon . For a while she stood there in the center of the room , listening , as if she expected something to come which would yet refute reality . But the silence of the house seemed hostile , almost urgently hostile . She hurried to the bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Fill all bathtubs with water , and all pails and all vessels , " the Government instructions of " What To Do " if invasion came had said . Slowly she extended her hand toward the faucet , slowly , and then her hand paused in mid-air , and her ear caught the demoniacal screaming that came up from the courtyard behind the house . But she could see nothing through the frosted-glass window , so she hurried out into the passage , grabbing her cane in passing , so she 'd be able to hurry better down the dark stairway . It 's that Gocssen woman , she decided , hearing the woman 's voice scream louder . Shc tried to hurry , tried . . . And when she reached the lower floor , she saw Gezina come running from the store . But she hurried on , ahead of Gezina , now seeing Katrien standing in the back door , petrified , with the madly raving Goessen woman in front of her , shaking her fist at her . Other people , neighbors and even strangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all stood there appalled . " And you , you little whore , " the woman was screaming at Katrien . " You pious-faced little whore . Leading that boy on , a clean boy , and then telling people he tried to attack you on the ice . You little bitch ! Do n't you imagine for a minute that I did n't know what was going on . And now that pasty pimp of a brother of yours , that Red , breaking this other boy 's head in with a brick . You just wait , you just wait and see what 'll happen to you ! " But now Mevrouw Haming had pushed past Katrien , and ,  | stationing herself formidably between the cringing girl and the frenzied woman , said tensely : " Shut up , you fool . Shut up . " For a moment the Goessen woman was silent , and started backing away . But then , seeing Gezina come out of the house , she began to scream again . " Yes , try to make me shut up ! Try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her that mealy-mouthed fool , her and her whoring children ? " She tried to get past old Mevrouw Haming at Gezina , who had put her arm around Katrien , and stood there , her face drained of all color . " Yes , you ! " the woman screamed , while Mevrouw Haming lifted her cane slowly , in one last desperate effort to stop her . " You ! It was that fine son of yours who tried to kill that poor German boy last night . Throwing a brick at him . Yes , but he 's been found out . He did n't suceed in killing him , see ! He did n't , and the boy recognized him , saw him there on the tower . Now what have you got to say about your precious children ? First that little whore there , and then She stopped . Mevrouw Haming had raised her cane high , and started swinging it . But then the onlookers gasped and cried out , because someone came bursting through the crowd at the door , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Go home , you poisonous fool ! " At the same time he had snatched the uplifted cane from Mevrouw Haming 's hand , and grabbed the Goessen woman by the shoulder . Her mouth hung open upon her yellow teeth as she stared up at her son . Vladimir folded his strong fingers harder over her shoulder . " You fool , " he said hardly above his breath . " Come home , you fool . Because it was I who threw that brick . I did it . Now why do n't you tell the world I did it ? " Her lips writhed convulsively and then lay still upon a twisted grin . She tried to edge away from him , backing toward the courtyard wall . She started groaning , a piteous , animal-like groan . And still his fingers clamped harder on her shoulder .  | Then old Mevrouw Flaming grabbed his arm and said bitterly : " Let her go now , man . Let her go . Before you make this worse . " He turned and allowed his fingers to relax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scurried toward the courtyard door , where the people backed away from her as if she could contaminate them . Once outside , she turned and ran . Vladimir was still standing there , silently , looking down upon Mevrouw Haming . Gradually his hideous anger seemed to be draining from his face . But his lips were still greenish-white , and the lines around his mouth seemed livid . Then he said slowly : " Thank you , Mevrouw . Thank you . Because when I get angry , when I ? " Dazedly he looked down at the cane he had wrested from her hand , and then he gave it back to her . " I guess one good turn deserved another , " he said tensely , with no intention of jocularity . Then he turned on his heel and marched out of the courtyard , with the frightened onlookers running out before him . Slowly Mevrouw Haming followed him to the courtyard door . She closed and bolted it behind him . People who had been leaning out of windows ducked back into their houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching her motions , standing there hypnotized . Mevrouw Haming walked toward them , and , touching each of their arms in turn , said : " Come now , let 's go into the house now , " her voice oddly calm and very strong .  | CHAPTER XI V THEN THE DANGER SEEMED TO RETREAT again ; Hitler had given further assurances that Holland 's neutrality would be respected . The populace breathed easier , and for that week end army leaves were once more granted . Perhaps everything would yet be settled in Norway ; and though that hope did n't seem strong , it was a hope which one clutched with frantic faith . But if it comes , we will resist , they said valiantly . If it comes , because as neutrals it became increasingly more dangerous to name the one and only enemy ; but it was safe to hope devoutly , that that one enemy was n't as dangerous as they had pictured him to be for many anxious weeks . That Sunday God would be beseeched from the pulpits ; the Queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayed ; strong men shut their eyes and steeled themselves . Renzel believed and hoped nothing . The inevitable had been on its way so long , so persistently , and was so close now that you could n't even escape its shadow . However , while he had previously imagined that he 'd be either grim or resigned by this time , he actually was neither . He only had a vast urge to snatch something from life before it was gone . It was an illogical feeling , which he did not try to combat . His emotions now seemed to be marshaled on one side , battling against his reason on the other . But the emotions created and commanded his needs , while his reason sat abeyant , entrenched as it were , like the Allied armies in France . It seemed that now on the brink of calamity he  | had to live , and was living . It seemed necessary that he build himself a small haven of refuge . He admitted to himself over and over again that he was in love with Leenie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was seriously sick with pneumonia , after several weeks of neglecting a bad cold , and that Grandmother had hurried to Haveland . He recalled how poorly his uncle had looked that Sunday , and he wondered if the man had all this time stubbornly held out , refusing to recognize the dangerous state of his own health because of the far more acute danger at the border . It was like Moente , it was much more like him than his surface cynicism , he realized . For a moment he wondered if he himself should n't go to Haveland . But there 's so little I can do there , and there may be so few week ends left to spend with Leenie , he fretted . His mother 's letter had contained other news which disconcerted him . It seemed that the injured young German had identified him as his assailant , and his mother strongly urged him to stay away from Daverdam , if he should be granted another furlough . " Unless , " she 'd added hopefully , " you can come secretly at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I prefer to talk this over with him alone , first , because he did get unnecessarily upset about Katrien 's run-in with that other German . " So that was what Katrien had been trying to tell him . He wanted to know all about it now . The knowledge might afford him more concrete justification for Vladimir 's deed and his own participation in it , a deed against which his sensibilities still rebelled . With the suspension of the high-charged tenseness of the last few weeks , however , and then the news that they would get a furlough Sunday , only one matter loomed importantly in his mind . He was going to see Leenie again . He had to see her , in spite of all other demands upon him . And somehow the prospect of seeing her made everything else seem brighter , too , so that by some strange logic he almost convinced himself his uncle  | must be getting better now . But half an hour before his train was ready to leave , Ernst arrived and insisted that they go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Renzel argued . " And we 'd only be in the way . Perhaps on our way back ... " Ernst had looked at him long and suspiciously , but had put up no further argument . They had boarded the train together , and sat in silence . Renzel knew that Ernst was expecting him to go with him to Daverdam . And how could he tell him anything after his Mother had expressly asked him not to ? There was consolation in his mother 's suggestion , too . It relieved him of any duty to go home . He could spend all his time with Leenie instead ; vaguely he promised his conscience that he might take a very late train to Daverdam . Actually , he knew that once he got with Leenie , he would n't leave her till he had to go back to camp . Of course , he wanted to know more about this affair between Katrien and that other German , but Ernst was the last person he 'd ever ask about it . So they sat together in uncomfortable , glum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neared Amsterdam , because there seemed something hostile in Ernst 's silent watchfulness . But it was n't till the train roared into the Amsterdam Central Station that he said to Ernst : " Look , you 're taking the next train to Daverdam , are n't you ? That goes in ten minutes . I think I 'm staying a while in Amsterdam . " Ile saw Ernst 's eyes grow hostile , and his last words came as a challenge . " I thought so , " Ernst barked . " I suspected just that all the time . " " Well , and what possible difference can that make to you ? " he snapped . " Plenty , " Ernst answered coldly , still sitting down , though Renzel had already jumped up and the other passengers were starting to file out . " I think you 'd better come home with me . I think Mother expects you . "  | " Oh , no , " Renzel answered . " She does n't expect me . " But he became confused and looked away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't always keep acting like a boy in knee pants , Renzel . " But Renzel started walking out of the train without answering him , and he got up and followed him . They were standing on the platform now , not quite facing each other , being jostled by the passengers coming from farther down the train . They remained standing there , with their luggage at their feet , both defiant . At last Renzel said calmly : " I think you 've interfered enough . I 've told you what I 'm going to do , so take it or leave it . It is n't my not going home that bothers you , anyway . " Ernst , now striving to be utterly calm and reasonable , at last conscious that other people were witnessing their quarrel , said : " Of course , I ought to be used to your strange way of doing things . Perhaps I could overlook it more easily if you had n't made such a fool out of me , keeping things a secret . As if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid this is no time or place for a quarrel . " " No , " Renzel said sullenly . " You were always mighty scared of all dramatics . " " I said , please , let 's not quarrel here . Let 's act like grownups , at least . " Tired of the fruitless bickering , Renzel did n't answer . " And I think , " Ernst continued evenly , " I think I would like to come with you . I think I would like to meet her . I have a notion that we can then be more reasonable about all this . " " Oh , " Renzel said . He looked down at the toes of his shoes , feeling his first determination to refuse Ernst 's request fading away within himself . Why not , why should n't I let him meet her , why not , he fretted defiantly . Then , looking up and studying Ernst 's face , he asked : " Why ? "  | " Because that 'll at least bring things out into the open , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your affairs into the open ? " Renzel asked him calmly , and this time he saw Ernst lower his eyes . No , you do n't , you never do , he thought . And now you ca n't even find any words to answer me . But pretty soon you 'll come out with some shopworn reply . . . " Well , do you ? Do you ? " he demanded , before Ernst could find his answer . " Let 's get away from here , " Ernst said , now touching his arm , as if he were in a forgiving mood . They did n't say anything else till they reached the waiting room , and once more they dropped their bags at their feet . " Are you going to let me meet her ? " Ernst asked suddenly again . " I do n't know , " he countered . " Well , tell me , then , what 's her name ? Where does she live ? " He fired the questions in rapid succession , assuming the offensive again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " Renzel said slowly . But Ernst continued blandly : " Shall I take the next train , or the one after that ? " Renzel shrugged . Suddenly it did n't seem to matter anymore . Let him meet Leenie . Leenie who was ten times better , ten times more honest , than Ernst . Besides , they were n't getting anywhere , and , unreasonably again , time seemed very precious , very short . " Well , come along , if you think you should , " he said . " That 's better , " Ernst said , as if a truce had been declared between them . " I take it we 'll walk . Do you mind if I check my bag ? " Renzel stood aside waiting for Ernst , suddenly assailed by uncertainty , for the first time in his life picturing Leenie as Ernst would see her . The way he himself had never found it necessary to look at her . Leenie and her " sister " Amelia , and . . . I 'd  | better not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why should he possibly care ; why does he pretend all this concern over me ? Why do n't I tell him to go to hell ? . . . He knew that Ernst was going to make an issue out of this , once he 'd seen Leenie . Was that the reason he himself had kept this affair so secret , making it a thing wholly apart from his Daverdam life ? No , he answered himself firmly , no that is n't the real reason . Ernst came marching back , now smiling cordially , saying ; " Naturally , Renzel , there is no reason why I should n't meet her . Naturally . But we 're brothers , and now we 're grownups , and if this is something you 'd rather keep from Mother , I ? " He had expected Rcnzcl to protest by this time , but when he kept his silence , he himself could n't go on . Even if Renzel was his brother , would that be sufficient reason for telling him about his own Oporto affair ? But Rcnzcl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that case should n't he try to save his brother ? But at last Renzel was answering . " I hope you 'll like Leenie , " he said slowly , " but if you do n't , I do n't see what you can possibly do about it . It seems to me now that we 've passed certain periods in our lives , certain things have shaped up definitely as belonging to me , others to you . Even though we happen to be brothers . " " You 're bound to make an abstruse issue out of it , are n't you ? " Ernst said crisply , trying to make light of it , realizing that he could n't answer his brother 's argument . His own airy answer seemed to restore him a little , and continuing in the same vein he added : " Look now , ca n't you imagine brotherly curiosity ? Purely that ? In a world that 's getting topsy-turvy , when I see you going around as if you lived on a private planet all of your own , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If that 's it , " Renzel said , " come along . " But he was n't deceived . He was disturbed . For the first time his relationship with Leenie had been thrown into bold relief , and it seemed that he was n't prepared to look at it that way yet . It should n't yet have  | tangible dimensions , recognizable shape , or any sort of objectivity . " If that 's it , " he repeated , " you ca n't be too critical either . " But his own words shocked him and he wished that he could withdraw them . They were now nearing her house in the narrow , not very respectable street , flanked by a little smelly canal , in which the sky with stars lay algid and very far away . " If you 'll wait here , " he said abruptly , " I 'll go and talk to her first . It may be better for us to go somewhere together . " " That 's fine , " Ernst said affably . Already he had sized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : This is just an affair , of course , and anybody but a moper like Renzel would make short work of it . Or was he in the woman 's clutches ? It could n't cost him much , however , he figured , forming a precise estimate of his brother 's finances . It could n't be that . But sometimes , for fellows like Renzel , it seemed necessary to run the whole gamut of an affair of this kind . He himself had n't wanted to be enmeshed in it . . . But Mercedes , then ? His chagrin flared up at these continually recurrent memories of his own sordid affair in Oporto . But instead of making him feel sympathetic toward Renzel , it made him angry with him . He walked to the edge of the canal and spat into it . Then very deliberately he lighted a cigarette , watching the flare of the match in the water below him . It was only a narrow canal , lacquered with night , but the stars and the rifted clouds gave the water an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was high . It startled him , and he stepped back from it , feeling the skin upon his jaws go taut . He looked back at the house where he had seen Renzel disappear , and suddenly he wished he 'd gone straight home to Daverdam . He now wished he had the courage to walk back to the station , before Renzel came out again . Renzel would understand . Or would he ? Or would he even care ? These are frantic times , he tried to tell himself , making of himself the liar and  | the lie , and all values are in disruption and flight , and I do have this duty toward my brother , and for my mother 's sake . But then he realized that he was jealous , knowing that Renzel had found something that he had missed . But did he actually want that ? No , the liar answered , if I ca n't take life at its old established values , I do n't care to take it . But why does n't Renzel himself come back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't for you . You 've missed it ; you would n't understand . Why do n't you go home now ? " " What 's the matter , ca n't you find your way home ? " a woman 's voice asked directly behind him . Startled , he turned . She planted herself invitingly in front of of him , sure of herself because of his uniform and this dark street . Suddenly he said nervously : " I 'm all right . I 'm all right . " " Are you sure ? " she asked . " Here they come , " he said , his voice loud with relief , seeing Renzel and a woman coming down the steps of the house . The girl who had accosted him walked away , chuckling a little . He was introduced to Leenie , but in his confusion he could hardly see what she was like . Besides , the street was too dark , ' ' and Leenie seemed already to have made herself master of the situation . It was she who led them to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without any music . And when at last he was seated across the table from her , Ernst realized he did n't know what he was going to say to her . Then , because she seemed so positive and put him on the defensive and because he realized that Renzel now seemed ill at ease , he could n't keep himself from saying : " Well , I had to see what this fool young brother of mine was up to . As you know by this time ? " he hesitated as if trying to remember her name , and neither she nor Renzel helped him ? " well , as you know , he has his head in the clouds half the time , and I thought  | perhaps he 'd found an angel . " But even his forced jocularity seemed to turn caustic with his voice , and he ended lamely : " Well , this is all in good fun of course . " He realized that while he was talking she had put her hand in Renzel 's to comfort him . He realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the way they sat there beside each other told him what a thousand words could n't have made clearer . The way she was looking at him now , still not answering , was as if she tacitly was giving him to understand that she had not heard those words because they should n't have been spoken . And yet at the same time her entire bearing seemed to exude love and protection for Renzel . Somehow it made him feel miserable ? and , yes , jealous . But hostilely he waited for her answer , his eyes challenging hers . " I think , " she said carefully , " that you and Renzel have very little in common . I think it might be difficult for you to understand each other . " Then turning to Renzel she said : " I think we could all have a drink to celebrate this occasion , do n't you ? " But still there was no obvious rebuke in her voice . Renzel did n't answer . He sat there , still looking at Ernst . His anger had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had realized that Ernst was never going to rest till he had broken up this love affair . Worse than that , he also realized he himself was sitting there examining Leenie as Ernst was seeing her , a woman several years older than he , several times more experienced . Not his class , not his kind . He sat there now assailed by all those facts which Ernst had uncovered for him , evaluating them now as other people would evaluate them . And he despised himself bitterly , wanting to withdraw his hand from hers , feeling unworthy of her . Then for a few minutes longer , after a waiter had come and Leenie had ordered the drinks , they sat there , now frankly studying each other as if they were three separate portraits up for exhibition and each was the artist of one of them . At last  | Leenie said : " Is n't this rather absurd and , well , let 's say un-necessary ? " And Ernst had the good grace to color deeply . Diplomatically he answered : " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . " Dissatisfied with his own words he added : " I mean out of so slight a thing . " " Exactly , " Leenie said evenly , but Renzel felt as if the words were directed toward him , as he sat there studying her in the light of Ernst 's intolerable standards . And then he realized that the result was , he had found himself wanting , not her . He felt indecent , mean and soiled . His faith in himself was floundering . At last he turned his face and looked at Leenie and smiled his slow , warm smile . And he said : " Ernst is taking the next train to Daverdam . I think it 's almost time . " Her smile met his in full acceptance . For that moment Ernst did n't seem to be there at all . And as if to see him again , as if they had to reckon with reality too , in spite of themselves , they looked simultaneously at Ernst . But Ernst said nothing . He sat there mutely , staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips moved as if he was going to say something . Then he shook his head grimly , pursing his lips , and slowly he got up . He put his heels together , and nodded stiffly at them . Then he turned abruptly , and without saying one word marched out of the restaurant . " I could n't help it , Leenie , " Renzel said . " He made me say it . At that minute I had to say it , or never see you again . " She nodded , but her smile would n't come . Slowly she got to her feet , and he followed her out into the street . She put her hand in his , and for a little while they stood still , just looking at each other . " Darling , " she said then . And when he only nodded mutely she added : " Let 's go home , shall we ? " " Yes , let 's go home . " Our home , she thought a little sadly , not wanting to think about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rea-  | son he is that way , and says those things , is because there 's something terribly wrong with him , deep inside of himself . " She said it as if she were really trying very hard to forgive him . " But he 's always so hideously sure of himself . Ernst always knows exactly what he 's doing , " he protested . " Oh , does he ? " she asked , willing to close the subject . Then there in the dark street he bent toward her and kissed her , and his mouth seemed very decisive . . . " Now that I know . Now that nothing else matters now . . . " " Yes , yes , darling , " she answered . " And with the world going to hell , and everything else rotten . . . " he murmured . They walked on then , but under the street light , she looked at him and saw that his eyes were moist . " Darling , " she said again . " And I 'm a ridiculous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own mind . I 'm a gawky fool , I " Of course you are , dear , " she said . When they reached the house , both Amelia and Geertrui demanded to know where the big brother was . But when neither Renzel nor Leenie answered them , they said : " We 're going out now . Together . And when we get back we 'll be very quiet . " In the bright , clear morning with pigeons preening upon the next roof , she awoke first , making her awaking careful so as not to disturb him . It was as if some hand had touched her , telling her : Now look out and see what you must do . Then she 'd looked first at his close-cropped head , and his now untroubled brow , then at the cleanest of all skies , and she still did n't know what to do . But she had come so close to knowing last night , so close . She had almost known the answer , when she had seen him recognize at last that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be fitted in somewhere between their own past and their own future , and also  | between the lives of others . And then it would disintegrate , of course . Or would it ? Last evening , with that brother of his sitting there beside them  --  like a vulture , ready to tear at the dead and fallen remnants of their love  --  she had for a little while been absolutely sure . The inevitable had come ; their affair was over . And she could have hurried its conclusion ; she should have hurried it then , for his sake . " Where are we ? " he asked , waking up with that nervous abruptness of his . " Oh , " he said then , answering himself , feeling for her , drawing her closer . " Oh , here we are , of course . " He tunneled his hand beneath her back , he lifted her and drew her toward him , on top of him , his legs twining around hers , his mouth close upon her mouth , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Wonderful , " he said . " You 're wonderful . " And then as if she were very small and very young , he took her and laid her beside him , adjusting her head against his shoulder , spreading a lock of her hair across his chin . They lay still so for a few minutes , only their fingers twining , their eyes on the clear blue sky . Then she disentangled her hand and laid it across his thigh , stroking it . " I do n't know , " she said . " I do n't know . " " We do n't know anything . We do n't want to know anything , " he whispered happily . " But that is n't it , " she said a little too earnestly , because she thought then that he realized so little . So little , that if she 'd say : " Marry me , " he would marry her . But I have to let him go .. . She pressed suddenly closer to him , and when he lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Now he must see how tired and apprehensive I am . She felt that he must read everything in her face , in all those planes and angles , the troubled lines ; that he must see it disintegrate there before his eyes , seeing nothing left but the horrible question , the only answer to which was that they should let each other go .  | But he saw nothing . At least not that . She read it in his eyes . She turned away and sobbed . " Now what , now what ? " he asked disturbed , his voice strangled . " I 'm being silly , " she said hurriedly . " Are you ? " he asked tenderly , taking her hair in his fingers and braiding it , while she lay with her cheek upon his bare chest , trying to recover herself , trying not to breathe hard . " Will you get me a cigarette , darling ? " she asked , without lifting her head . " Will you , quickly . " " Of course , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands and laying it gently on the pillow . Then he leaped out of bed with a swift , lithe motion , of which he never would have thought himself capable , finding the cigarettes , matches , and ash tray all with one swift motion of his hands . She watched him , the lean naked body , the gully down his back . She watched him come back , seeing him not athletic , but clean and young and straight . He was standing over her then , putting the cigarette between her lips , lighting the match , holding the ash tray in his free hand . " Come quick , and get warm again , " she said , holding the covers high like the flap of a tent . " Come now , and see how close you can get . Do . This is a lovely morning , is n't it ? " He cuddled very close , forgetting the ash tray , letting it teeter on the covers . With his mouth close to her ear he said , as if it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " And you know , I 've never loved anybody else . I never could have , I did n't know how . So when at last I knew , I thought , how shall I say it , because I have to say it , and then last night it seemed that I 'd known the words a long time . But they 'd kept themselves hidden somewhere , waiting for me . " " But did you really know , did you ? " she asked , wanting him to make it terribly definite . " I knew , but the words did n't want to come to me . As if they  | did n't quite trust me yet . Maybe because it always takes me so long to find out anything . But now that I know , I 'll know it forever , and always . " " Silly , " she said and kissed his cheek . " Take away my cigarette . It 's in the way . " He took the cigarette from between her fingers , crushed it in the ash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost gravely , he settled down beside her again . " And now that you know , that you know the words as you say , now what ? " she demanded . " Great God , " he mumbled , laying his chin upon her breast , " you 're full of questions . Such funny questions , too . " " That 's right , " she said , rebuking herself , kneading his fingers . " That 's right . " On the other side of the closed door she heard Geertrui and Amelia whispering . Of course , she thought , this is Sunday and Geertrui is going to visit her father . Of course , and I am full of questions . And questions somehow get answered , but always against your will . Why do I try to hurry them ? But why should he have to come to me , me , out of all the hundreds and thousands ? For somewhere the end would come , and this , too , would be over . The end was either near or far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no need hurrying it by seeking it out . " You do n't have to get up till eleven , " she told him . " You do n't have to at all , " as if he had protested . " No , " he said , feeling pride in himself that now he knew exactly what she wanted , that this time she did n't want to let him go till the very last moment . Now he knew that he was n't asking for something impossible , or out of turn , nor was he making demands on her which she did n't dare fulfill , either for her own sake or his . There was now this silent bond , and this unspoken agreement between them , and neither had forced it upon the other .  | He put his arms around her and drew her closer , thinking , as if the words of his thoughts went skipping away along a clear blue-green sky , as if the trees against that sky fanned delicately in an eastern wind , as if small furred animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking then in concrete , lettered words : How did I come to find her ? How was it possible , even if I 'd sought diligently until death ? I 'm not a good searcher . . . " Darling , " he asked , intending the question as a half-articulate expression of his emotion , as if he had to cry something to the sound of them , " darling , if we were married would all this get lost ? " " Yes , " she said gravely . He almost heard the gravity of her answer . Then it scurried away with the little foxes beneath the swaying trees . It was lost as running foxes were lost , always . He said then calmly : " But I will marry you . After all , there can be no possible reasons left in the world why we should n't get married . " He faltered a little then before he added , " That is , while I 'm still whole , and alive . " " Yes , yes , of course , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married . " But she hurried the words as if they could overtake his last words and undo them . Because he had to live . . . even though their marriage would fail . . . even though . . . Anxiously she thought : Now I have no possible right to refuse him . No possible strength . . .
