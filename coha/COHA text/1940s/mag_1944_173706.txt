THE LOST WEEKEND - Charles Jackson - Farrar &; Rinehart ( $2.50 ) . <P> Webster was much possessed by death And saw the skull beneath the skin . . . . <P> - T. S. Eliot . <P> American novelists of the 20th Century have been much possessed by damnation . <P> Though Hemingway , Faulkner , Steinbeck et al . never use the old-fashioned language of theology , the world they describe is a world where the people are predestined to the damnation of death , defeat , madness or senility . In The Lost Weekend , an unevenly brilliant first novel , the sense of damnation is strong . But even stronger is the sense of suspense-will he escape ? why ca n't he escape ? why does n't the damn fool answer that telephone ? 0-which is the quality that makes the hopeless tale into a horror story , luring the reader on and on to the inconclusive but hopeless end . <P> In a sense , every novel creates a little world of its own . In that sense The Lost Weekend is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damned . The story tells of five days in the life of Don Birnam , a clever coward who is drinking himself to death . <P> Although there are other characters - his brother , who supports him , lives with him ( in Manhattan ) and tries un successfully to keep him away from liquor and out of trouble ; a girl who is in love with him and does her equally un complaining nurse 's part ; various people from whom he " borrows " money he will never repay , with whom he makes dates he never keeps or from whom he buys the liquor that is alternately his salvation , his personal devil and his end-all - all these people are seen only from Don Birnam 's view ; they are important only in so far as they reflect his situation or supply the background for his lyrical ad ventures . <P> If Don Birnam were more purely comic he would be Mr. Toad ; if he were more purely tragic he would be Hamlet . <P> What makes him such an Ancient Mariner for the unwilling but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many an ordinary American oc casionally feels in himself .
