txt A calll Ito enact the heaviest budget in United States history , expected by some observers to exceed $100,000 , - 000,000 , will be submitted by President Roosevelt tomorrow to Congress , which will gather to hear his message accompanying the outline of the staggering war costs . The temper of the Congress , which has pledged itself to strict economy in channels not affecting the war effort , was indicated in a declaration from the Republican minority group on the Appropria , tions Committee that " Congress must recapture and hold the purse strings for the people . " Chairman George of the Senate Finance Committee gave some indication of what was in the budget message when he declared that it was considered possible that the raising of ** to $16 , - 000,000,000 in new revenue might be proposed . If this large increase is asked and enacted , he said , it was almost certain that some form of compulsory savings would have to be voted by Congress . Would Ease Individuals ' Load Mr. George is supporting a proposal to ease the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporations . He has suggested tentatively that a 10 per cent payroll deduction from individual salaries , of which at least 5 per cent would be in the form of compulsory savings , redeemable after the war , and a 5 per cent " compulsory loan " taken from the gross earnings . of corporations might produce " as much as the President will ask for . " . Mr. Roosevelt will not appear personally to deliver the budget message . In connection with the budget message and the need for enacting anew tax bill that will exceed the record-breaking revenue measure of last year , the pay-as-you-go proposal to ease the burden on individual taxpayers is almost certain to come before Congress . Sentiment in favor of some form of current taxation has been gaining . The statement in behalf of the nine Republican members of the Appropriations Committee was issued tonight by Senator Nye , the ranking minority member , following a conference of the members , who include Senators Bridges , Lodge , Holman , White , Gurney , Brooks , Peed and Burton . " Not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searching and minute consideration of all items of appropriation requested of Congress but that there would be a demand for fullest accounting of moneys appropriated through more recent years , " Mr. Nye stated . " Of particular interest to this group is the question of large reserve funds which allegedly are being created out of Congressional appropriations . " The Republican minority said it had plans for " the more efficient handling of appropriations in the Senate " which it was confident would " win approval and enthusiastic cooperation from the majority . " " So vast have become the annual appropriations that it is apparent that there should be thorough study of appropriation requests , " the minority statement said . " During the past year haste , in the name of the war emergency , was often a factor preventing the care such large appropriations properly deserved . Without harmful delay we feel that changed practices in the Senate could be pursued advantageously in the future . " The minority said it was considering recommending the hiring by the Appropriations Committee of its own staff of experts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The expense probably would be justified by " mighty returns in savings , " it was added . Flynn Dispute Is Expected Another issue expected to come before the Senate is the matter of appointment of Edward J. Flynn , chairman of the Democratic National Committee , as Minister Plenipotentiary to Australia . Mr. Flynn said last week that President Roosevelt had given him the appointment and would send it to the Senate on Monday . The White House , which usually makes such announcements , has said nothing . Republican Senate leaders have indicated that they would challenge Mr. Flynn 's appointment , with Senator Taft raising the issue of the city-owned paving blocks which were used to pave a courtyard on the Democratic leader 's estate , an episode later investigated by a Bronx County ( N. Y. ) grand jury , which exonerated Mr. Flynn . Some Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have predicted , however , that the appointment will be confirmed when it reaches the Senate . An issue to be investigated Tuesday morning by a subcommittee of the Senate Interstate Commerce Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ordered last June by James C. Petrillo , president of the American Federation of Musicians .
