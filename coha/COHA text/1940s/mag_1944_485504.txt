THE discussion in the Senate on Thursday over the failure of the President to keep Congress informed of his acts and instructions in the Hawaiian matter , would have had more weight if the attacks on his reticence had not come mainly from those who avow their desire to see the present provisional government recognized and supported , or at , least , let alone , by the United States , and who hold that any interference with this government now by the President will be an " act of war " which should , under the Constitution , be authorized by Congress But not one word was said in the debate as to what a President should do when an unauthorized act of war has been committed in a foreign country by a representative of the United States , and a legitimate representative government thereby overthrown This is exactly what has happened in Hawaii . This is clearly a wrong done by the United States . Flaathe President under the Constitution no power to undo wrongs committed in foreign countries without authority by his officers or agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also , that the wrong done in Hawaii ought to have been righted at once , and that it is monstrous now , after ten months , to disturb the established order of things But the wrong , if a wrong , consisted in the overthrow , with our help , of , the government preferred by the majority of the Hawaiian voters . It can not become a right as long as the majority of the voters have not acquiesced in it Have they been consulted ? Is it the American - doctrine that ten months or a year legitimizes a successful usurpation , and that a minority hasonly to maintain itself in power by force during that period in order to deprive the majority of its rights ? Who is the American public man-who will become responsible for this doctrine ? Any one who has read the history of the Republican party during the last thirty years would expect to see all the leading Republicans in both houses denouncing the President for not settling the Hawaiian trouble by taking a plebiscite in the Islands ; but , strange to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men of color are Democratic voices A plebiscite is the very last thing the Republicans desire Great amazement is expressed in certain quarters over Ambassador Bayard 's remarks about Hawaiian affairs . What he said was , that the President was simply following a policy of magnanimity and justice , and had never thought of interfering by force to set up or put down a government in Honolulu , his main wish being to give the Hawaiian people a chance to determine their own form of government without American dictation . This is spoken of as betraying the " secrets " of the Administration But what reason has any sane mind had at any time to think that the President intended anything else ? All the furious talk about his trampling on the Constitution and shooting down Hawaiian patriots has been purely gratuitous , without a- shadow of support in anything he has said or done In fact , it has been confessedly based upon what he was going to do , the critics being sure that they knew what that was They showed some signs on Monday of being aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their eye , and are already preparing to find a victim In another quarter . Ex-Minister Stevens has all along represented his action in- recognizing the provisional government of Hawaii as in perfect harmony with the views of Capt . Wiltse of the Boston , " now in his honored grave " But there is an officer of the Boston yet in the land of the living , who gave a very different account of the affair to Mr. Blount Lieut . William Swinburne , recounting the events of January 17 , 1893 , says that he was present at an interview between Capt Wiltse and several gentlemen claiming to be the provisional government They asked for recognition from the captain , but he inquired whether they had pos- session of the police station or the barracks . They confessed that they had not , as , in fact , their main object in seeking recognition was precisely to enable them to overawe the Queen 's troops . " Very well , gentlemen , " said Capt Wiltse , " I can not recognize you as a de factogovernment until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to guarantee protection to life and property . " This was undoubtedly the correct view , but Stevens regarded it as thoroughly un-American , and himself recognized the conspirators while they were still shivering with dread lest the Queen 's 600 well-armed troops should fall upon their 60 raw recruits . Then President Dole thanked Stevens , and asked him to be kind enough to loan him the United States troops for the purpose of storming the police station . Mr Charles Nordhoff of the Herald had a most destructive letter in that journal on Tuesday calling ex-President Harrison 's attention to various fatal con- cealments and perversions in Mr Stevens 's report and that of the Hawalian commissioners , as brought out by the evidence collected by Mr Blount . Some of these concealments , as , for instance , the protest of the Queen 's minister of foreign affairs against the landing of the troops , are most important The evidence collected by Mr Blount ought in fact to have closed the mouths of Stevens and his defenders long ago , but it will not . The manner in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short of a national disgrace From Stevens down it has been impossible from the beginning to get them to discuss the evidence in detail When he , after a long delay , appeared with a statement , it consisted almost wholly of rather vulgar abuse of Mr Blount and the Administration . Another matter is not less important . Should Hawaii be annexed , we may be sure it will be a precedent under which other islands  --  probably West Indian  --  and other States , inhabited wholly or in large part by a colored population , will be brought into or under the dominion of the Union It is Most needful , therefore , that the political status of these people should be settled now Are they to be voters who may any day decide a Presidential election , or are they to-be subjects to be ruled by proconsuls sent from Washington once in four years in return for campaign work or money ? How are they to be made to fit into the time-honored policy of the Republican party with regard to the Southern negroes ? What will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more important questions than these have ever been submitted to the American people , and yet not one word in answer to them have we been able to extract from the Tribune or any other Republican organ . Nothing comes from them day after day but a dreary and monotonous bow-ow-ow at the President and Mr. Blount The exportation of $500,000 of gold on Saturday , followed by further shipments on Tuesday , are regarded with indifference in the money market The fact is that such a movement , under existing conditions , is a sign of health and not of disease . With call money as low as 1-fr per cent here , while it commands 2+ in London and 3 or 4 in Berlin , an exportation of gold is desirable . If the gold is owned by us , we shall get more for its use abroad than could be obtained here If it is owned by foreigners , we shall no longer be paying interest for something that we can not employ profitably . These are very ele440 The IsTation . Vol. 57 , No. 1485 - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not under apprehensions of a change in the standard of value arising from the purchases of silver by the Government On the contrary , we are now witnessing large shipments of silver abroad , for which gold would have beenrequired under the regime of the Sherman act ; 450,000 ounces of the white metal having gone out on Saturday Another fact of importance is the increased productiveness of our own gold mines , those of Cripple Creek , Colorado , haring risen to $261,000 in October , as compared with $204,000 in September , a gain of-30 per cent There is an Italian proverb which says that there can be no omelet without the breaking of eggs The committee on ways and means are learning the truth of this every day . Whenever it is proposed to levy a tax on anything , a lot of people rise up and say that it must not be done , and they make such a " poor mouth " that most people take pity on them and agree that it would be a very bad thing to do But obviously the Government must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Republicans have been very cunning They have used up the Treasury surplus , they have abolished from time to time the largest sources of revenue , and have finally swelled the pension list , nearly thirty years after the close of the war , to a figure that equals the cost of the large standing armies of Europe That is the situationto be faced It may-be unjust , but it will not yield to scolding It can not be railed away . any more than the seal could be railed from off Shplock 's bond . The Democratic party must take the risk of imposing some new taxes . Let us see what the Government raised in the way of internal revenue in 1866 aside from the tax on manufactures and the tax on incomes . Here is the list : Stamps . . ; 15.044,373 TUC on gross receipts . 11,262,430 Licenses other than liquor and tobacco 14,011,132 sales. - 4,002,263 Legacies and successions .... . . 1,170,979 Banks , railroads , etc . . .. 12,109 4-0 Miscellaneous . - 4,440,290 *02,040,907 It is safe to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double the amount that it yielded in 1860 , with the same rate of taxation A stamp duty , for example , of the same kind that was imposed then , would now yield 830,000,000 . At one-half the rates imposed in 1866 it would yield the same amount as then . Or the same amount might be raised by stamps on a smaller number of instruments , as , for example , conveyandes of land , mortgages , and shares of stock transferred or created after a certain date . Probably a stamp duty would produce-less trouble and encounter less opposition than any other thing that could be devised . The drift of sentiment among RepUblicans in Congress regarding the-position of their party towards the tariff bill seems to be rather with Senator Hawley in pronouncing for prompt action than with Senator Aldrich in suggesting the consumption of several months In discussion , simply for the wasting of time Senator Sherman is quoted by the Herald 's correspondent as saying that he thought a month or six weeks would be time enough for the Senate discussion , although it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the debate might take , and that there would be no talk for the mere sake of talk The policy advocated by Senators Sherman and Hawley is so obviously the only rational one , from a party point of view , that it will be quite impossible to secure much support for obstructive proceedings The bill is surely going through , sooner or later , and nothing in the world is to be gained by making it later . Manufacturers and business men generally are everywhere anxious for promptness in the matter , and if the Republican party should try to prevent this , it would suffer . The Government of Chili has put in a claim for damages for the seizure of the Itata by our Government during the Harrison administration . It will be remembered that this vessel was lying at San Diego waiting for a cargo of arms for the Congressionalists , that a deputy marshal , or a person who supposed himself to be such , went onboard and seized her , or supposed he had done so , in behalf of the United States , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Rata put him ashore , took on her cargo of arms and sailed for Chili , that the United States war-vessel Charleston was despatched after her , and pursued her to Chilian waters , where she was surrendered by the Chilian authorities , and finally that the United States District Court , in which a libel was filed against her , decided that the Rata had not violated our neutrality law or any other law If the trespass committed by our Government had been committed by a private person , a judgment for damages would have been given against him at once . Whatever loss was-incurred by the Rata ought to be made good without further delay Chili paid us $75,000 for a very dubious claim growing out of a street riot in Valparaiso We ought to show no less readiness in paying a bill which our own courts have declared to be valid in every moral point of view - Kansas and Colorado continue to pay the penalty for their folly in electing Populists as Governors . The Colorado executive persists in his determination to call a special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do no good , and which there is no money to pay for ; and the people are petitioning the members to adjourn as soon as they meet , as the cheapest way out of the difficulty - The Governor of Kansas last week issued an executive letter to the boards of police commissioners throughout the State , ordering them not to enforce the law for the punishment of vagrants , and paying a warm tribute to the tramp as very likely a Diogenes or a Columbus in disguise . The result is already seen . in a rush of tramps into Kansas from all parts of the West . " The army of vagrants , " says a Topeka despatch , " are flocking into the State in great numbers . They throng the railroad yards , and boldly demand food and clothing at private residences . Reports of petty thefts and robberies are being received from all parts of - the State , but as the officers have been forbidden to make arrests for vagrancy . they are powerless to rid the communities of objectionable characters . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it is good for the rest of the country We have been told for many years that neither of the old parties had any capacity for government ? and that what the lieople needed was a " people 's party , " which should rule in their interest . As long as the Populists were never tried , their claims were very effective with the unthinking . The farmers of Kansas at last became convinced that the condition of the State would be vastly improved if they tried the promising experiment , but they have already had more than enough of it , and are lamenting that GOT . Lewelling is fastened upon the commonwealth for another year In Colorado even the mine-owners and workers are so far recovered from their craze as to see that Gov . Waite 's policy only means an addition to their burdens But nothing short of such an experience as that of Kansas and Colorado would ever have convinced the general public that Populism was really so great a humbug . As it is , the whole country now realizes the truth about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the general term of the Supreme Court at Albany last week upon the conduct of the State Canvassing Board in consummating the theft of the Senate which Hill , Maynard , and Rice had planned , is a most appropriate sequel to the November verdict of the people upon Maynard 's conduct The general term not merely summons the members of ? the board to appear in court and show cause why they should not be punished for contempt , but ? it goes over once more the disputed question of the legal status of the Mylod return from Dutchess County , and declares that , whatever else the State Dec. 14 , 1893 The Nation. , 1 Board of Canvassers had a right to do , it had no right whatever to canvass that as either a legal or a valid return Yet it was for the purpose of having this return canvassed by the State Board that Messrs . Hill , Maynard , and Rice removed the legal return from the official records of the State The finding of the general term upon this point is directly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , and with the report of the Bar Association upon Maynard 's conduct . The excitement over the question of giving Catholic schools a share of the school-fund in this State and in Maryland and New Jersey , where definite proposals have been made looking that way , seems to us unnecessary . With influential Catholics opposed to such a policy , and with a pronounced and almost overwhelming sentiment against it among the non-Catholic population , there is no likelihood whatever of any such measure being successful or even seriously pushed . Its revival just now may be due in part to the hard times , which have undoubtedly made the burden of supporting the parish schools unusually - hard to be borne by their patrons . It may also have been taken up , in this State at least , on the theory that the control of the Legislature would rest in quite other hands than those in which the late election placed it . We believe that the American people are ready to consider any fair plan of compromise on the school question such as that proposed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriations of public money for Catholic schools  --  this , not because the schools are Catholic , but because they are sectarian If the Catholics are entitled to such appropriations , so are the Jews , so is each of the Christian sects , so are the agnostics , and the Christian Scientists , and the Theosophists The only practical effect of the gathering of the striking Danbury hatters in town meeting to vote themselves 850,000 will probably be the speedy bringing of the absurdity into the courts to have the sawdust let out of it . Meanwhile the incident should afford food for thought to those ardent socialists who look to see the state , when conducting all industry collectively , display heroic virtues and supernatural wisdom . As a writer in a current magazine justly remarks . " The new socialism freely constructs imaginary societies in which every fact of history is deliberately violated The whole relation of man to things is cast aside , and a new Man  --  a social creature with new instincts  --  is thrust into being , to enjoy a new relationship to things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such a man as the Oxford don who recently wrote , in a book on the Labor Movement ' - " If society were able to control industry and wealth for the good of its own members as a whole , 1 imagine that the only differences in this respect would be two . First , it would be only the incompetent and not also the idle who would be allowed thus to live on the surplus products of , other men 's industry . Idleness would be regarded as a social pest , to be stamped out like a crime . Secondly , the miscellaneous selection of the incompetent for suitable provision , at present effected by birth , fortune , favoritism , intrigue , quackery , and other means , would be superseded by a more scientific adjustment . All who could work would have to work . " - Working simply because one can work ! The mad hatters know a trick worthtwo of that , and vote themselves money out of other people 's pockets without a suspicion of the New Era halo anywhere in sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the course of an address at Philadelphia on Tuesday week ? " All athletics are beneficial to the progress of students with their studies . . . . They sharpen his intellect and give him a stronger mind . The recreation and exercise thus derived enable him to more easily master the difficult problems his studies develop . While athletics are at their height m college , the student never neglects his studies . " We have found it difficult to believe that the president of Princeton used this language , and our doubts were strengthened by the following item in Thursday 's budget of football news from Princeton : " The team received a communication from the faculty forbidding them to play any more games this year . The faculty are of the opinion that study should take the place of sport after Thanksgiving Day . This necessitates the cancelling of the exhibition game scheduled with the Columbia Athletic Club at Washington next Saturday . " How small the reporter must feel who put all that talk into President Patton 's mouth . If his silly inventions had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the football team to play as many games as possible , and to keep it up all winter under cover in the Madison Square Garden , where , in fact , games have been played in cold weather , and in this way develop a set of intellects which would ' astonish the world by the way they mastered difficult problems . One can not help feeling sorry for the new cabinet in Italy ? Crispi 's , it promises to be at this writing . It can not do much better than the old one , unless it gets rid of the Triple Alliance It is that which is gradually working the ruin of the Italian kingdom . The drift towards bankruptcy grows stronger every day , because the armaments ashore and afloat which Italy is compelled to maintain under the treaty are wildly out of proportion to her means . She is literally surrendering , for the sake of protection against a remote danger , most of the things which constitute national success and happiness If her present situation lasts much longer , it will become a , question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to France years ago , live under her patronage , and-take up a position of mere sufferance in the Mediterranean The national finances are going to ruin , the destruction of public and private credit is destroying the character of public men and bringing parliamentary institutions into utter disrepute with the masses . That there is not more talk of a republic is undoubtedly due to the fact that nobody feels that a republican assembly would be any better than the present parliament - It looks more and more as if France would soon have another war on her hands . This will be unwelcome to her at a time when Siam and Morocco demand such close attention , not to speak of African boundary disputes with Great Britain , Germany , and the Congo Free State , unfinished conquests in Dahomey and the Sudan , an unsettled feeling in Europe , and various complications in her home politics . For years , letters from Madagascar have dwelt on the increasing friction between the government at Antananarivo and the French Resident By the treaty of 1885 France has charge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with the internal administration of the island . This seemed a new and convenient form of protectorate , a way of keeping off all rivals while quietly waiting for her convenience to pluck the pear , or until it was ripe enough to fall of itself into her lap From the beginning , however , the arrangement has worked badly , as has a similar one between Italy and Abyssinia It is hard to say what relates to external affairs and what does not . Such questions as the rights of granting exeq nature to consuls , and of giving large land or mining concessions to foreigners , have led to endless bickerings . The French have tried to make their protectorate as broad as possible , the Havas , promptly regretting that they ever agreed to such a thing , have wished to minimize it , the English Protestant missionaries , who are a power in the land , and are naturally jealous of French and Catholic influence , have helped to envenom a quarrel that has now reached the point where hostilities may break out any day The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more or less well armed and disciplined .
