No one was surprised when plays on religious themes hit their top in popularity in Great Britain during the war . Crowds saw them in shelters , tents , churches . But almost everybody was surprised at the phenomenon that followed : in the year after the war , the morality and miracle play and the historical religious drama had grown , not waned , in popularity . Today they play all over England . <P> All this was highly gratifying to the Religious Drama Society , which has been operating on a shoestring from a one-room London office . Most pleased of all is the man directly responsible : Elliott Martin Browne , 46 , the tall , gaunt director of R.D.S. since 1936 . It was he who had prodded T. S. Eliot , poet and High Churchman , to write two of the most popular modern religious plays : The Rock and Murder in the Cathedral . <P> Last week Martin Browne 's R.D.S. gave the cause an added boost . It helped out the Sheffield City Training College in a week-long course in religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to walk on stage to how to produce a play . Said one bespectacled girl : " It 's been 100% . Absolutely something for everyone . " Sheffield 's school was the biggest practical effort the R.D.S. has seen so far . Its success has already led to planning courses like it in three other cities . <P> Search for Truth . R.D.S. has proved to the average man that religious plays need not be boring . It got the chance during the war , when Browne directed a band of professionals called the Pilgrim Players . Community groups got interested in their morale-builders-Murder in the Cathedral , Geoffrey Whiteworth 's Father Noah , Ernest Rhys 's The Deluge-decided to do something themselves . Sheffield led the way . In 1943 its interdenominational Association of Christian Communities hired a professional actress as dramatic adviser , has since organized plays with groups varying from mothers ' unions to tough boys ' clubs in the slums . <P> R.D.S. does not put on plays , but rents its sets of plays to amateur groups , gives them free dramatic advice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the objective of a religious play-and the secret of his success . <P> Said he last week : there are two ways of approaching a religious play . " Some say it should ' do good ' to the audience , and I think most emphatically that that produces the worst kind of nauseatingly sentimental play . People hate to feel that they are having good done to them . . . . I believe you should write a religious play because you want to express the truth , and if you are a Christian , then the truth will be Christian truth . "
