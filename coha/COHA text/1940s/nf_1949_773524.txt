txt // force has increased from approximately z million in 1890 ( 4.6 per cent of all married women ) to 42 million in 1940 ( 15.2 per cent of all married women ) . ' The economic role of the wife in the home has undergone various modifications . The urban apartment does not provide as many tasks to occupy her as did the frontier farm . Many women do not know what to do with their new leisure and so spend it in various " unproductive " ways instead of having more babies . These and similar generalizations do not apply with equal validity to the fifth of the population living on farms . The behavior of millions of farm wives remains substantially in accord with the traditional role , i.e. , the way the wife " should " act . The birth rate among the farm population is still comparatively high , and laborsaving devices have not removed all the allegedly therapeutic drudgery from their lives . The modern wife therefore can not be summarized in a paragraph . The performance of her role varies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large cities to those who still live in comparative feudal passivity in the hinterland . The majority of wives are in a transitional stage from one role to another . The " lost sex " is not yet completely lost . The role of the wife is in process of change . There is little question as to what her role used to be , at least in terms of the stereotypes that we often substitute for the confused reality . The wife role was formerly stabilized about a comparatively few general functions , from which most women apparently never seriously considered deviating . This stability has been replaced by a vast uncertainty , in which nobody can agree about what the role of the wife should be . Certain clerical and lay critics maintain that she should return to the role that she played in the " great " days of the family . But they do not tell us exactly how such a return would be managed in a city apartment . A few enthusiasts at the other extreme joyously insist that this is only the beginning of feminine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cradle . This new freedom , they continue , is highly desirable , and everything should be done to promote it . For these persons , the " lost sex " is not lost at all . She is the new pioneer . The future will probably see a compromise , with some features of the traditional role and some of the new . There is no discernible movement toward a complete reversal of the homemaking role , with the husband taking over the home and the wife directing the economic enterprise , nor is there any biological mutation in prospect , whereby the childbearing role of the sexes will be suddenly reversed . The role of the wife will continue to be centered about these two functions . Within these limits , however , the signs point to an increasing emancipation from many of the conventional limitations that have been her lot . The wife will continue to be gainfully employed in large numbers . She will continue her participation in higher education , thereby increasing her educational status vis a vis her husband . She will continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been her accustomed lot in the past . She will continue to develop a series of roles shaped more by her own abilities and inclinations and less by traditional limitations . If this be treason , she will say , let us make the most of it . No such revolution has taken place in the role of the husband . Books are not written that refer to him as " the lost sex . " Sermons are not given , exhorting him to make more money , procreate more children , or love his family more deeply . His putative boredom in the office , factory , or store is not the subject of solicitous inquiry by various interested groups . His sexual frustrations are not exposed to the fascinated observation of a variety of amateur sociologists , although the Kinsey report has stimulated interest in this field . His ego is not allegedly thwarted by the complexities of modern urban life , nor is any irreconcilable conflict postulated between his ego , id , and superego . His economic role is considered eminently satisfactory ( except when he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His family life is simplified by the physical refinements of modem // technology . He is still doing the things a husband is supposed to do , rather than engaging in behavior no self-respecting one would dream of . In short , his behavior and his role are substantially in agreement , and all is for the best in this best of all possible worlds . Attitudes toward the New Role . In this chapter , we shall deal with the most spectacular single modification in the role of the wife ? that arising from her gainful employment . We are concerned not only with the number of married women currently in the labor force , but with the millions of single women now employed who will subsequently marry . The number of married women who are , who have been , or who will be gainfully employed is not precisely known , but an increasing proportion of all women are employed for different intervals . In 1940 , over 70 per cent of all single women over fourteen and out of school were gainfully employed , and 80 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' A large proportion of all married women thus have their marital role colored by their past , present , or future employment , irrespective of their present status . This fundamental change in role has been received by men and women with mixed emotions and ambivalent feelings . On a conscious , rational , intellectual level , acceptance has been widespread , with special emphasis upon the economic advantages accruing from the gainful employment of married ( and single ) women . On the unconscious , emotional , and irrational level , acceptance has been neither so complete nor so unqualified . These conflicts have nothing to do with logic , but are deeply entrenched in the traditional expectations of our culture . Man is a rational animal . But he is also a cultural animal , a conservative animal , and an emotional animal . He may therefore accept something on a rational level and reject it upon an irrational level . He may say one thing and feel another . His conscious protestations may not always accord with his unconscious prejudices . He may therefore suffer an unconscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , even though he consciously realizes its desirability and thankfully accepts her pay check . The new division // of labor is often rationally accepted and emotionally resisted at the same time . ' These emotional stereotypes are not confined to the husband , whose sense of security may be subtly undermined by the employment of his wife . Many women themselves do not feel completely at ease in their new role . Social expectations operate as forcefully upon the wife 's attitudes and values as upon those of her husband . She is often fully aware that she is violating certain traditional taboos by appearing in this new role , even though , more often than not , she is working because of economic necessity and not because of a desire for a career . Even the most ardent feminists , who vociferously proclaim their right to a life outside the home , may be hiding a spiritual malaise occasioned by their unorthodox role . This observation does not deny the right of the married woman to work if she so desires . In view of the conservatism of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is proceeding at her own risk . The situation is so complex that even this generalization can not go unqualified . A few decades ago , the woman ( married or unmarried ) who worked outside the home was opposing both the rational and irrational phases of social attitudes . In the last century the working wife was often a real pioneer , proceeding gingerly through the primeval forest along a path only faintly outlined . Today the road is much clearer , especially on the rational level . Whether married or single , the wife no longer has to run the social gauntlet symbolically from which formerly she could hardly have emerged unscathed . Overt defiance of conventional expectations is no longer necessary in order to undertake this new role . Many of the expectations governing women 's conduct have changed forever , making it increasingly easy ( in terms of society 's definition ) for the wife to work . There is no longer any serious opposition to the employment of single women before marriage . The time may come when the last vestige of // resistance may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Extent of the New Role . In the year 1940 , there were 12,845,259 women in the labor force . This number was composed of 6,349,474 ( 49.4 per cent ) single women , 4,560,835 ( 35.5 per cent ) married women , and 1,934,950 ( 15.1 per cent ) widowed or divorced . ' Approximately one out of every seven married women was in the labor force . More than one out of every three women in the labor force was married . Both in absolute numbers and in percentage of the total , gainfully employed married women have increased rapidly since 1900 . In that year , there were 769,000 in this category ; in 1940 , as noted above , there were 4,560,835 . This represented an increase in employed married women of 493.1 per cent , whereas the number of married women in the population rose only 117.9 per cent in the same period . In 1900 , only 5.6 per cent of the married women in the country were gainfully employed , whereas in 1940 the figure was 15.1 per cent . This was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women comprised 15.0 per cent of the total female labor force , a percentage that increased by 136.7 per cent to 35.5 in 1940 . The change in the new marital role over a forty-year period is thus quantitatively indicated . ' World War II saw an accentuation of the trend toward the increasing employment of married women . Out of a total of 16,630,000 women gainfully employed in 1944 ( and an all-time high of 19,610,000 on July 14 , 1945 ) , 9 the number of married women increased to 6,700,00010 in the earlier year . Most of these employed wives had their husbands in the home at the time of enumeration , although an unknown number temporarily lost // their husbands to the armed forces later in 1944 and 1945 . The number with husbands still in the home in 1944 was 5,340,000 , whereas 1,360,000 employed wives were without their husbands . Of the total of 6,700,000 employed married women , 1,470,000 had children under the age of ten , with the added complication in roles entailed by such a status . The husbands of an estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children under ten . " Their burden was the most complex of the entire civilian population . The roles of mother , father , homemaker , and breadwinner were somehow combined by this gallant band of more than a quarter million women . World War II thus accelerated certain changes in the role of the wife . These wartime changes were not so much new as an intensification of those already under way . The traditional roles are still firmly embedded in the culture pattern and even the war , with men and women working side by side in many activities , did not bring complete emancipation . World War II hastened the eventual acceptance of mere equalitarian roles by causing widespread changes in the economic behavior of women . The full employment of the immediate postwar years was accompanied by a continued high participation of married women in the labor force . A survey made by the Bureau of the Census in April , 1947 , indicated that the number of gainfully employed married women remained virtually stationary from the wartime figure for 1944 . An estimated 6.7 million women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented 20 per cent of all the married women living with their husbands and suggests the extent of the dual role of worker and homemaker . This was an increase from 15.1 per cent in 1940 to 20 per cent is 1947 of the married women living with their husbands . A high participation of married women in the labor force is thus not a wartime measure . One out of every five married women apparently wishes to continue in this role indefinitely . " // Economic Functions and Women 's Roles . The increasing participation of both married and unmarried women in the labor force has been caused by broad changes in the social and economic structure . Mass production and the rationalization of industrial operations have reduced the number of jobs requiring skilled labor and substituted a larger number with unskilled or semiskilled requirements . Women have fitted admirably into these new functions . The increase in clerical work accompanying the rise of big business has meant millions of new jobs for women . New methods of merchandising have established a market for sales personnel , with women in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trade and service fields , such as laundries , beauty parlors , restaurants , and stores have added to the demand for female employees.13 These functional changes in the economic scene have brought far-reaching modifications in the economic behavior of married and single women . Much of this behavior is so new that it has not yet become an accepted part of the pattern . Hence it is not fully incorporated into the role of the wife . Additional insight into the economic role of married women is derived from a consideration of the types of occupations in which they engage . A few married women enjoy the presumably satisfying experience of professional self-expression as actresses , artists , college presidents , lawyers , and musicians . This number is very limited , however , compared with the number of married women who work as clerical employees , sales girls , factory operatives , and domestic servants , activities that could hardly be called careers . Of the 3,554,721 married women in the labor force in 1940 who were living with their husbands , only 319,782 were classified as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 170,590 were school teachers and 55,237 were student or trained nurses . Only a miniscule 1,575 were listed as actresses ; 4,441 as artists and art teachers ; 6,465 as authors , editors , and reporters ; 2,809 as college presidents , professors , and instructors ; 1,509 as lawyers and judges ; 2,483 as physicians and surgeons ; and 21,492 as musicians and music teachers . These // latter married women might conceivably be said to be following a career outside the home . Besides them , however , there were the 925,762 clerical , sales , and related workers ; the 906,817 operatives in manufacturing and kindred activities ; and the 457,269 domestic servants.14 The specific functions performed by the bulk of the married women gainfully employed outside the home suggest that most wives work because they have to , not because of any desire to bolster their egos through creative self-expression . The majority work to support dependent children or supplement a family income that is not sufficient to supply more than the minimum essentials . Economic necessity is thus the predominant motive in causing the majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It should be emphasized , " remarks an authority on the working woman , " that the entrance of women into industry and the professions . . . has not been the result of conscious and deliberate revolt on the part of women against prevailing social attitudes . . . but rather a change in attitude due primarily to new experiences forced upon them in the process of living in the present order . . . A large proportion of the women working outside the home who are or have been married , " concludes this observer , " are working to contribute to the support of themselves and their families , if indeed they are not solely dependent upon their own earnings . " 15 The changing roles of courtship and marriage are , as we have seen , most apparent in the urban community . The rural-farm and ( to a less extent the ) rural-nonfarm families have retained many of the traditional expectations in all aspects of marital relationships . The economic roles are no exception . Increasing participation of the wife in gainful employment is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1940 was only one third . as common for wives in the rural-farm areas as for those in the urban areas . Urban communities had 55 per cent // of the potential married female workers and 72 per cent of the actual married female workers . Using a slightly different criterion , more than 20 per cent of the potential married workers were found in rural-farm areas , whereas less than 10 per cent of those actually employed were living in these areas . Gainful employment of married women is an urban characteristic ; the accompanying emancipation has progressed more rapidly in the cities than on the farms . " The comparative employment figures still do not tell the whole story . Forty per cent of the rural-farm women ( both married and single ) in the labor force were engaged in agriculture , of whom approximately a third were farm operators or managers . Another 22 per cent of the total gainfully employed rural-farm women were in domestic service . The change in role assumed by this two thirds of the gainfully employed rural-farm women is naturally not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and single ) who work outside the home in office , store , factory , or other commercial establishment . The amount of freedom involved for the gainfully employed urban wives is incomparably greater than for the rural-farm wives , who tend to remain on the farm , either as owners , operators , or domestic servants . In the city , the wife works for a cash income , is away from the home , and is emancipated socially , economically , and sexually to a much greater extent than the rural-farm woman , even though the latter is also classed as gainfully employed . When we are considering the modification in the traditional marital role through gainful employment , we are dealing primarily with the urban wife . " Other reasons for this urban preponderance of the new role are not hard to find . " Urbanization , " suggests Hazel Kyrk , " means not only greater pressure for money income , fewer children and lightened household tasks ; it means also a more liberal attitude toward employment of daughters and wives , and , above all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // general social factors that have produced changes in the entire repertoire of marital roles are summed up in this sentence . The increasing proportion of the population dependent upon monetary income , the lower performance of the biological role , the changed internal role of the wife , the increased liberalism , secularism , and materialism of the urban community , and finally the centralization of industrial and commercial opportunities in the city have combined to produce the changing economic role of the wife . The composition of the group that assumes this new role is also related to the income of the husband . As indicated above , the majority of wives work not for glory but for gain , not because they especially enjoy it but because they need the money . This compulsion is brought out in a study of the employment status of married women with husbands present in the home living in metropolitan districts of 100,000 or more in 1940 . With the exception of the group reporting no income or not reporting at all , the proportion of employed wives is consistently higher as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the labor force in all income groups was 16.7 per cent ; that is , about one out of every six married women in the large city whose husband was present was gainfully employed . In the income group from $1 to $199 per year , 27.6 per cent of all wives were gainfully employed ; the $200 to $399 group had 24.2 per cent ; in the $400 to $599 group , the percentage of wives employed was 22.7 . There was a sharp drop between the $1,500 to $1,999 group and the $2,000 to $2,999 group , with 14.0 per cent of the wives in the former category employed and only 9.2 in the latter . Families in which the income of the husband was $3,000 and over had only 5.6 per cent of the wives working outside the home.1 ? Reasons and Roles . Economic motives are thus fundamental in determining those women who will adopt the new obligations and perquisites attending the role of the gainfully employed . These motives are partially summarized as " the pull of attractive job opportunities or the push of economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modifies the pull and push , as changing social attitudes , smaller families , and simplification of the internal role of the wife facilitate or inhibit the outside elements . If the push of economic necessity is sufficiently strong , married women will take jobs that are unpleasant , monotonous , and underpaid , with no thought of a career . The majority are driven into employment by the push of economic necessity rather than by the pull of attractive opportunities , although some will always be drawn by the hope of interesting and exciting work . An indeterminate number of wives work for a third reason , an overpowering distaste for domesticity . These wives are not impelled by any illusions of an exciting career in the business or professional world to undertake ( or continue ) their activity therein . Neither are they pushed into the labor market by the necessity of supporting their children or augmenting the wages of their husband . Their motives , whether conscious or unconscious , are to avoid housework and domestic responsibility at all costs , even if it means spending their days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychic satisfaction . No invidious implication is involved in this designation , for some wives are simply lacking in the inclination for household management . They find their traditional role intolerable and are willing to take almost any sort of outside employment to avoid the ( to them ) boredom of the home . The motives of this group are negative rather than positive and they are accepting the mild annoyance of gainful employment in preference to the greater annoyance of homemaking . " A final group of wives are not poverty-stricken , ambitious , or bored with their role as homemaker , but are ( rightly or wrongly ) convinced that they should be more than " mere " homemakers . Many wives are expensively educated and trained along some particular line . They may feel that their role as steward of a small apartment does not fulfill their obligation to society . Many older women find themselves in this category after their children have grown and have left the parental home for good . Wives who are // especially alert to certain public causes may hire a domestic servant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in various social services . This new role may have a therapeutic effect upon the wife herself , as well as contributing to the general welfare . Instead of spending her middle years in idleness , brooding , or boredom , many wives work out their own salvation by playing an active role outside the home . In such cases , the financial increment is secondary ; the important consideration is the contribution to something outside the orbit of their private lives.22 The ideal conditions under which married women assume the role of gainfully employed are those in which they are pulled , rather than pushed , into the labor market . " Ideally , " says Hazel Kyrk , " the married women at work would be those who had found employment on at least as favorable terms as if they were unmarried or as if they were men with the same abilities to offer ; they would be those whose home conditions and family responsibilities facilitated their gainful employment . " 23 These ideal conditions would mean that wives worked because they wanted to and not because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the wife working than without ; and that her working did not deprive the home , husband , or children of the personal services that may be more vital than her extra earnings.24 The ideal and the actual situation do not often coincide . The majority of working wives are compelled by the negative push of economic necessity , rather than the positive pull of attractive job opportunities . The employment of married women , especially those with young children , may produce a net social deficit in neglect and delinquency , plus the more subtle deprivation of emotional security . Wives whose dislike for domesticity assumes the proportions of an aversion are probably better off at work than at home . Many wives who enter the labor market to fulfill a real or fancied obligation to society are probably making a net contribution to the general welfare . But these // happy few are in the minority . The majority find difficulty in satisfactorily combining the internal and external economic roles of the employed wife . In the process of filling the role of gainful employment , that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is difficult for the wife to have her cake and eat it too . The Employment Cycle . The specific reasons women assume the role of assistant or sole provider outside the home also vary according to the individual life span of the woman and the exigencies of her own fate . Some women never work at all , in the sense of ever being numbered in the labor force . Others work for a few years and then drop out of the labor force forever . Others work intermittently before and after marriage , with time out for the birth of children . A general pattern would take the following stages : " 1 . Premarital Employment . Most women , especially in the urban community , work between the time they leave school and marry . This interval may last from a few months to several years , at the end of which time the majority leave the labor market . 2 . Marital Employment . A considerable and probably increasing number either do not give up their jobs at all when they marry or return to work very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these women supplement the family income with their earnings , which are often as substantial as those of their husbands . 3 . Maternal Employment . The birth of a child causes the retirement of most women from the labor market , at least temporarily . For many wives , this event signals their permanent abandonment of gainful employment , with the alleged compensations deriving from this role . Irrespective of the ultimate number of children , a large number of wives never work again . 4 . Intermittent Employment . For many of those in poor and moderate circumstances , the birth of the first child is shortly followed by a return to the labor market . A second child will similarly bring a temporary retirement , and this intermittent // employment may continue until the wife is too old to work . For wives whose family income is very low , the push of economic necessity is strong enough to send them out into the world in search of employment , even though they have young children who need them at home . The situation of these wives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their employment are universally unpropitious. 5 . Employment during Widowhood or Divorce . Thousands of women in their middle and later years are annually forced into the labor market by the death of their husbands or by divorce . In 1940 , there were 1,934,950 widowed or divorced women in the female labor force , comprising 15.1 per cent of that body.26 Only about 40 per cent of the widows and divorcees were actually in the labor force in 1940 , a limitation that resulted in large part from the age and health of the widows . The number showed a sharp increase between 1940 and 1947 . In the latter year , 1,805,000 widows and 792,000 divorced women were gainfully employed . The total in these two categories was 2,592,000 , as compared to 1,934,950 in 1940 . The postwar period saw an estimated 28.3 per cent of all widows in the labor force , as compared to 69.5 per cent of all divorced women , a difference still reflecting the median age of the two groups.27 A large number of widows and divorced women are thus employed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this phase at some time in their lives.28 The role of employed wife is therefore not permanent for most women . Childbirth , economic improvement , and increasing age are all factors that operate against continuous employment . Some of these factors are matters of choice and others of necessity . Childbirth occurs at least once to most wives , often at times and under conditions which they would not voluntarily choose . The death of the husband is an " act of God , " and the // widow often must go to work whether she wants to or not . The business cycle and chronic low wages do not reflect the conscious planning of the wives forced to supplement this inadequate income . Viewed in this light , the intermittent assumption of gainful employment is not ordinarily a matter in which the individual wife has much ultimate choice . The majority of women assume this role at some time in their lives , sometimes ( in their premarital years ) voluntarily but for the most part because of factors beyond their control . Conflicts and Roles . The working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arising from the conflicting interpretations of her role that are currently present in our culture . Personality in the sociological sense is a social product , in which the patterns are established in the culture and reflected in the individual . Many of these current patterns are completely incompatible . The wife is thus expected to be simultaneously a homemaker and a worker , a mother and an earner , a domestic servant and a glamorous companion . These conflicting expectations comprise one of the basic themes of this book . Marital behavior has so changed that the traditional expectations ( roles ) no longer apply with their former relevance . These differences between expectations and behavior arise in many different connections , but one of the most fundamental areas of conflict is the gainful employment of married women . A striking characteristic of this conflict in role is the element of indecision implicit therein . The wife often has difficulty in choosing between the exclusive role of homemaker and that of homemaker plus wage earner . The resulting indecision may produce many conflicts and frustrations in the individual psyche , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sense , the physical drudgery of the pioneer wife , whose role was defined almost exclusively as childbearer and homemaker , may well have produced less frustration than that of the modern wife whose role is physically much easier . The former certainty has given way to a conflict of desires and expectations . The occupational hazards of the pioneer wife included premature death from excessive child bearing and general overwork ; those // of the modern , middle-class urban wife include emotional frustration and neurosis.Z9 These role conflicts may take other forms . The wife may be constrained by conservative public opinion to carry on the role of housewife , even though her inclinations and abilities would otherwise lead her outside the home for creative self-expression . The husband may oppose any gainful employment on the ( conscious or unconscious ) ground that it constitutes an infringement of his masculine prerogative and an accompanying threat to his ego . Whether the wife works and incurs the displeasure of her husband or whether she broods at home , the element of conflict is present in either case . The personality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the conflict in roles . The performance of this dual role entails a considerable expenditure of psychic , as well as physical , energy . Other roles of the employed wife may suffer as a result of this division of time and energy . The affectional role may be impaired , as the wife is too tired to derive the maximum satisfaction from the sex relationship or other affectional contacts . The husband may consider that his wife is losing more than she is contributing when she is too exhausted to be a companion in his leisure hours . The companionate role is important in contemporary marriage . The husband who is thus deprived of companionship may consider the game not worth the candle . The energy to play both an adequate internal and external role is subject to wide individual variations . Some strong and capable wives can play both roles without any perceptible diminution in efficiency . Others can play only one role adequately at a time , and still others can play neither role with any pronounced satisfaction to themselves or their husbands.3 ? The role conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the unquestioned glories of our democratic system . The free , public institutions of secondary and . // higher education provide substantially the same education for boys and girls . The academic attainment of girls is often higher than that of boys , and the former not unnaturally may wish to put this expensive training to specific use . The democratic ideal of maximum self-realization presumably applies equally to both sexes , and the educated girl can hardly be blamed if she takes this ideal literally . As we have seen , these attempts at self-expression may not meet with the unqualified acceptance of either husband or the community . The educated woman is often frankly bewildered as to which role she should play . Her democratic education has encouraged her to play both roles . The traditional expectations may interfere with this performance . " The problem of education for women is one upon which we can only comment briefly . Subsidiary problems arise on both the primary and secondary level , but when the college and university level is reached , the difficulties become complex . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college or university and hence will be especially alive to the role conflicts among this group . It has been suggested that higher education for women should be determined by three general considerations . The first comprises the field of study ( mathematics , for example ) and is obviously the same , irrespective of sex . The second deals with the problems of the contemporary world and the general training for responsible citizenship . Men and women have equal democratic rights , and it is important that they have equal educational opportunities . The third factor concerns the needs of women as women and relates to the problems that they will meet as homemakers and mothers . The best answer to this difficult problem would appear to be " an education which would give the possibility of differentiation within a broad framework which would be the same for men and for women . " 32 Considerable pressure is currently being brought to bear upon educational institutions ? especially colleges for women ? to dif- // ferentiate more sharply between their work and that given to men . The proponents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason to teach English literature to prospective mothers and homemakers . Ranged against the equality of education for both sexes are also many psychoanalysts , who deplore the alleged loss of fundamental feminine roles by the woman . The education approved by the various members of these schools would presumably rest upon home economics , domestic science , child care , and kindred subjects , instead of the liberal-arts curriculum , with its growing emphasis upon the social sciences . It is manifestly impossible here to suggest a satisfactory answer to all phases of this problem . The solution ? if solution there is ? does not rest with education alone . It rests with society as a whole.33 The wife is not aided in her quest for certainty by the allegations of many persons who postulate a complete and fundamental instinctual difference between the sexes and insist that any departure from the prescriptive role of wife and mother results in irreparable loss of certain " feminine qualities . " The increasing awareness of the importance of culture in the molding of personality has seriously shaken any uncritical assumption of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formerly believed to be biologically feminine result from conditioning by the stereotyped expectations that have dominated our culture since Biblical times . Normality and abnormality in terms of social definition are verifiable realities , and the major source of the contemporary female dilemma arises from the contradiction between conduct and definition . Normality and abnormality in " biological " terms , on the other hand , are often difficult to substantiate when we are dealing with " feminine " and " masculine " aspirations , proclivities , and values . The current difficulties of the wife may rest largely with the social definitions , instead of with the presumed biological differences . In such cases , the problem of ultimate adjustment is not insoluble . Social definitions change , and behavior may ( in theory , at least ) be reconciled therewith . // The gainfully employed wife is therefore faced with a dilemma not her own making . In an effort to support herself and children , supplement the income of her husband , or ( in relatively few instances ) find a career outside of marriage , she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplemented by the education that is her democratic birthright . She is acting in response to the demands of her immediate situation , which is the only way she can act . At the same time , though , her behavior is judged in terms of standards established during the long millenniums when there was only one role for woman ? and that a definite one . Neurotic frustrations were historically minimized because of the lack of diversity of choice of roles . These traditional expectations are not in accord with behavior in a dynamic society , which has fashioned new forms of conduct never before seen on land or sea . Expectations may eventually adjust to behavior . Married women may then enter the labor market without the guilty feeling of selling their feminine role to the highest bidder . That time is not yet ! Chapter X Biological Roles Biological Roles and Social Patterns . The biological role in marriage refers to the expected reciprocal behavior of husband and wife culminating in the birth of one or more children . The biological role also involves the expectations relating to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The performance of the biological role has varied in fertility with the time and place . Conscious control of this behavior on a large scale is comparatively new and indicates ( among other things ) the profound influence of technology upon human life at its source . Considerable concrete evidence is available concerning the trends in performance of this role . The birth of a child in marriage is an honorific event , and the proud parents are happy to record this event officially . The birth of a child out of marriage is considerably less honorific , and data on this behavior are therefore less reliable , as well as marginal to our study . This chapter , therefore , will deal with trends in biological behavior and the conditions that have produced or modified these trends . The biological role is most heavily exercised by married women in their twenties . In a recent year , some 350,000 children were born to mothers in the fifteen to nineteen age group . The age group of twenty to twenty-four bore 930,000 children . Women in the second half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , whereas those from thirty to thirty-four had an estimated 510,000 . The group aged thirty-five 169 // through thirty-nine had 375,000 children , or approximately as many as those in the fifteen- to nineteen-year group . ' The golden twenties are thus the fertile twenties for most American wives . This fact reflects social as well as biological considerations and does not mean that between ages twenty and twenty-nine is biologically the most propitious time for child bearing . Women are physically capable of bearing children at a much earlier age , but they are not considered socially ready for motherhood . The typical American wife thus has her first child somewhere between the ages of twenty and twenty-nine . Many contemporary conflicts in marriage derive from the fact that social expectations have changed less rapidly than the behavior they are supposed to define . This lag is true in the case of the biological role . The expectations comprising this role arose under economic , social , and demographic conditions that encouraged large families . In common with many other traditional expectations , the biological role was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agrarian , religious , and familistic ? all characteristics making for fertility . A series of social and economic changes changed the actual biological behavior in marriage . Many persons are thus acting in ways that are not sanctioned by the traditional expectations . Here , as elsewhere , behavior and role do not coincide . The family with only one or two children is in the position of failing to fulfill its traditional role . The biological role is not instinctive . The original impulse for sexual union and the behavior leading to the birth of a child are very different . The first is a biological urge , and the second is a social impulse , depending upon such factors as the state of the industrial arts , the business cycle , the price level , and conditions of peace and war . The invention and widespread dissemination of contraceptive measures have meant that , for the first time , human fertility is subject to social control . The sexual impulse that periodically culminated in the birth of a child no longer has // the same inexorable termination . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own sake , with considerable freedom from the former biological implications . The biological role in marriage has , of course , not been corn , pletely modified by the introduction of contraception . Despite lugubrious prognostications of race suicide , such a catastrophe appears remote at the moment . ( Race suicide may arise from other social inventions , but not from contraception . ) World War II and its aftermath were marked by an enthusiastic performance of the biological role , with the largest crop of babies in history . Even the low birth rates of the depression years , however , did not mean that the nation faced imminent biological extinction . Most couples still enter marriage with the idea of having children . They may postpone this fruition until their personal economic circumstances are improved . They will have fewer children than their great-grandparents . They may have fewer children than they plan for , conception and gestation being as fortuitous as they are , but modern couples still plan to have one or two children . ' Marriage thus still emerges into the family , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family is not so large as formerly , but it is still the family . Husbands and wives still have children , even in the shadow of atomic war . The biological role is still performed , although it results in one or two instead of five or six children . Religious drives still motivate parents toward children , although the relative importance of these controls has decreased . Psychological urges for personal immortality still play their part in stimulating fertility . The exercise of the sexual impulse without any motive whatever may be the most important factor in the biological role . Whatever the motives or combination thereof , this role is far from obsolete . Human fertility is determined by a variety of social factors . The business cycle is an important element in this process , with the birth rate directly correlated with changes in the price level . Full employment , high wages , and economic security combined // with psychological compulsions during World War II to increase the total fertility to unprecedented levels . Other and even more general trends also influence the performance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modified marital fertility by creating the choice between a large family and a high standard of living . Closely related to this worship of the golden calf has been the emphasis upon materialism , whereby the additional expense of a child is weighed beside the attendant financial sacrifice . Each new child makes it more difficult to keep up with the Joneses , since a limited income can be stretched only so far . The cult of romantic love stresses the desirability of youth and glamour . Many wives consider the maintenance of face and figure more important than several children , who might ruin these indispensable romantic prerequisites . The wife was formerly content to lapse into domesticity with no thought of further romantic attraction . The restless romanticism of our day has made this relaxation more difficult , for the wife may be called upon to match her appeal with a younger rival . We shall consider these trends in more detail below . We wish merely to point up the fact that the biological role is not instinctive , but is an extremely sensitive social product . Biological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " it is said , " are a function of the conditions of living , the values , and the historic culture of a people . " 3 Substituting " biological role " for " familial and reproductive mores " gives us the central thesis of this chapter . Marital roles are extremely tenacious and linger for generations in the culture after the way of life has changed . Current practice is approaching the small family , although the expectations held by many people still point to the large family . A representative sample of upper-class Americans were recently polled concerning ( a ) their ideal for family size and ( b ) the size their family actually attained . The ideal embraced 3.9 children , whereas the actuality was 2.4 , a // considerable discrepancy between the norm and the experience . ' This biological behavior is not the result of capricious individual choice , but a reflection of a fundamental social change . We may examine these elements of change in terms of their impact upon the biological role . 1 . Individualism . From the Protestant Reformation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and American culture has gradually shifted from the family to the individual . This shift has meant a discrepancy between biological behavior and the biological role . Husbands and wives think of their individual happiness , rather than the welfare of the family as a unit . The culture of contemporary America is based upon the individual , and his highest development is the most important criterion in marriage and the family . We have seen some of the implications of this individualism in our study of romantic love . We shall see many more when we deal with conflict and frustration . Individual development and high fertility are difficult to reconcile . When the choice is placed before the average person , he tends to choose the maximum development of the individual . 2 . Success . In a pecuniary culture , success is naturally defined in terms of pecuniary attainment . In an agrarian culture , the determinants of success are quite different . These criteria include a large number of children , both as means to economic achievement and as ends in themselves . Social mobility based upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere along the line . The single-minded pursuit of gain in an urban , mobile , restless society ordinarily precludes a large family . Children are postponed during the early years of marriage for reasons of economy and because the rising young couple do not wish to be encumbered . A society of open classes opens the way to success to the couple who can move fast , both geographically and socially . A society of closed classes , on the other hand , encourages children because the family can not rise in the social scale no matter how few children it has . 3 . Materialism . Closely allied to individualism and the cult of // success is a pervasive materialism that stresses material and financial , rather than biological or spiritual , considerations . The biological role is limited by financial factors , especially among the middle-income groups , who must choose between children and the scale of living to which they would like to become accustomed . The monetary cost of raising a child from birth to the age of eighteen ( exclusive of public education and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represents approximately three years ' income in all groups . Families with an income of $2,500 thus spend an estimated $7,763 per child during his first eighteen years . This figure includes the costs of being born , food , clothing , additional shelter , medical care , transportation , recreation , and incidental expenses . ' The husband and wife about to have a child are seldom aware of the precise extent to which they are mortgaging their financial future . Nor would this knowledge deter them from having at least one child . The birth and rearing of this first child , however , emphasize these financial facts . When children cost so much , people have fewer of them . 4 . Romanticism . Romantic love brings an unquestioned euphoria to courtship and marriage . It also affects the biological role through its emphasis upon physical attractiveness before and after marriage . The wife attempts to maintain her romantic glamour and good looks as long as possible . Children may jeopardize the romantic appeal that is so necessary in starting and maintaining the marriage relationship . Mothers with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may retain their romantic aura well into their forties , but mothers with more than this minimum number of children find difficulty in remaining glamorous , or at least they think they do , which amounts to the same thing . Furthermore , the romantic relationship between lovers is essentially one between two persons . A third party ? even // their own child ? cnanges this contact from one exclusively of romance to one increasingly familial . 5 . Education . The increase in education has had an important influence upon the biological role . Broadly speaking , an increase in education has a restrictive effect upon fertility . This relationship is especially apparent in the case of the mother who has fewer children as she has more education . The 1940 Census indicated that the number of children under five per 1,000 wives varied from 720 for those with under five years of schooling to 278 for those with a year or more in college . ' There are obviously more elements in this situation than the educational attainment of the wife . Nevertheless , the highly educated wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In so doing , she tends to curtail her biological performance ; only in exceptional cases can she function as the mother of many children and an actively participating citizen . Such other factors as wealth , knowledge of contraception , and incentive are present in addition to education . The latter is a convenient symbol for many of the cultural factors that modify the biological role . 6 . Religion . The aforementioned factors have all helped to change the performance of the biological role . Individualism , materialism , the cult of success , romanticism , and education all represent cultural forces that have appeared to challenge traditional expectations in regard to the number of children . The decreased influence of organized religion represents a decline in the power of an institution that once exerted virtually unchallenged control over the principal family roles . Throughout most of the development of our culture , religion and the family have operated in friendly reciprocity , with the one supporting and enhancing the other . Implicit in the traditional Christian attitude toward marriage and the family has been the concept of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glory of God . The gradual acceptance of contraception in marriage by the // Protestant denominations has further modified the biological role in this predominantly Protestant country . In effect , the sanction of the " rhythm " method by the Roman Catholic Church would tend to have the same effect , although the means employed are different . ' We have , therefore , two related trends in religious sanctions , each with an important bearing upon the biological role . The first is the relative decline in control exerted by organized religion . The second is the increasing ( if tacit ) acceptance of contraception by all religious faiths . The culture norms relating to fertility and based upon organized religion have undergone significant changes . The net effect of these and other social changes is seen in the progressive decline in the size of the family from 1790 to 1940 . In 1790 , the year of the first census , the family had an average of 3.0 children under twenty-one , whereas in 1940 the number was 1.3 per family . This decline is not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fewer living children than is sometimes supposed . Part of the decline between 1790 and 1940 may also be attributed to the increased percentage of couples with no children under twenty-one . In 1790 , only 20 per cent of the families had no children under twenty-one , a percentage that had doubled by 1930 . This comparison does not mean that 40 per cent of all married couples are permanently childless ; it merely means that there were no children in that age group living in the family at the time of the census . Greater life expectancy allows many more children to come of age and leave the then empty nest . ' Other changes in the biological role were indicated in the trend toward smaller families in the decade 1930-4940 . The percentage of families with three or more children under twenty-one decreased from 24.3 in 1930 to 18.1 in 1940 . As noted , the average number of children under twenty-one in 1790 was 3.0 , // which meant that a considerable percentage had more than that number . The changing definition of the biological role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with three or more children . In the decade 1930-1940 , the proportion of all families with one or more children under twenty-one decreased from 61.2 per cent to 55.7 per cent . ' Viewed from any statistical perspective , the secular trend has been toward a drastic curtailment of the biological role . The biological role is not a matter of fecundity , but rather of fertility . The former term refers to the biological ability of the human species to reproduce itself , whereas the latter refers to the degree to which man exercises this ability.YO Fertility is a matter of group expectations and behavior , the former constituting the role and the latter the activity that may or may not be in accord with the role . Leading population authorities call our attention to the cultural aspects of the biological role . " The birth rate , " they say , " . . . is capable of considerable variation , being .. . directly dependent on individual behavior . Changing economic and social conditions not only determine the opportunity that people have for marrying and for raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibilities . " 11 We have seen some of the cultural factors that have changed this behavior . A new biological role is therefore in the making , based upon the small family and having as its basic presupposition the control of fertility through contraception . Biological behavior has been changing rather rapidly in recent decades , with a decline in the average size of the family from 4.9 persons in 1890 to 3.8 persons in 1940 . The ideological elements comprising the social role have not changed with the same rapidity , but there is evi- // dence that they are changing . Many young married people no longer desire large families but state candidly that they want only one or two children . The concept of the small family is increasingly apparent , with many of the devices of opinion formation mobilized to increase its scope . Books , newspapers , magazines , motion pictures , and advertising depict the ideal family as consisting of two or three children . The family is seldom currently pictured as comprising a half dozen or more children ; families of this size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no longer the ideal . Its place has been taken by the small , streamlined , modern variety.12 Biological Roles and World War II . These secular trends were interrupted by World War II . During the war and the immediate postwar years , the marriage rate and the birth rate rapidly increased . The marriage rate responded to the wartime combination of material prosperity and psychological incentive . These marriages were fertile , as the young husband and wife exhibited a new ( and presumably temporary ) form of biological behavior in the face of prosperity and war . We shall indicate here some of the changes in biological behavior. 1 . Marriage Rate . The marriage rate per 1,000 of the population was 9.2 in 1930 , the first full year of the depression . By 1932 , the rate had dropped to 7.9 per 1,000 , from which point it gradually recovered during the rest of the decade . In 1940 the rate rose to 12.1 per 1,000 , reflecting increased prosperity and the rising threat of induction . The rate rose to 13.2 in 1942 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1943 and 1944 , the rate dropped to 11.8 and 11.0 , respectively , reflecting the number of men of marriageable age overseas . The final year of the war saw the rate rise slightly to 12.3 in 1945 . " The first postwar year of 1946 saw marriage reach an all-time high point with the unprecedented rate of 16.4 per 1,000 of the population . This was about one quarter above even the previous // high figure of 13.2 for 1942 . The 1946 marriage rate for the United States was not only the highest in the world for that year , but was apparently the highest ever recorded during the past century ( with the possible exception of an estimated 20.4 per 1,000 in Hungary in 1919 ) .14 Despite the gloomy forebodings of those who annually predict the eventual disappearance of marriage and the family in the United States , both appear to be flourishing . 2 . Birth Rate . Trends in the birth rate followed closely upon those in the marriage rate . In 1930 , the crude birth rate per 1,000 of the population was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one year after that for marriage , with 16.6 births per 1,000 . From there it rose to 17.9 in 1940 , 18.9 in 1941 , and 20.9 in 1942 . The 1943 figure was 21.5 , with 1944 and 1945 experiencing a drop to 20.4 and 19.8 , respectively.15 The first postwar year ( 1946 ) saw the birth rate reach a figure of 23.3 per 1,000 , which was the highest annual rate recorded up to that time since the birth registration area was established in 1915 . The rapid demobilization of the armed forces during the last few months of 1945 and early 1946 resulted in a tremendous surge in the birth rate in the latter part of 1946 . A provisional rate of 29.5 per 1,000 population was established in December , 1946 , which month marked the postwar peak of the birth rate . This high rate carried over into 1947 and resulted in a provisional birth rate of 25.9 for that year , surpassing the 1946 high of 23.3 by 11.2 per cent.16 The massive social changes of World War II brought about equally massive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fertility of the general population thus showed a striking // increase between 1940 and 1946 . During this period , the population under five increased from 10,541,524 in April , 1940 , to 13,361,000 in June , 1946 , a total increase of 2,800,000 . The Bureau of the Census estimated that approximately 46 per cent of this increase resulted from the higher fertility of married women . An estimated 26 per cent of the gain arose from the greater proportion married among most age groups ; 22 per cent came from a larger number of women in the population at the most productive years ; and 6 per cent came from a reduction in infant mortality . The 46 per cent estimated increase in married fertility represents a change more in keeping with traditional roles and reverses ( if only temporarily ) a decline in the birth rate that had been evident for over a century . " The wartime change in biological behavior was most apparent in the urban areas , where the previous decline had been more apparent . This increase in fertility was approximately twice as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 34 per cent gain in children under five in the urban areas , as compared to 18 per cent in rural-nonfarm areas and 17 per cent in rural-farm areas . It is not clear whether this spectacular urban increase represents births deferred during the depression or a basic change in attitude among the city dwellers . It does suggest , however , that improved economic conditions produce a voluntary increase in fertility among urban families . ' 8 Significant changes in fertility also took place during World War II in relation to occupational status . The previous inverse relation between fertility and economic status underwent a substantial ( although probably temporary ) modification . For a long time , the occupational groups best able to provide material and cultural advantages for children have had small families , whereas the less privileged groups have continued to have large families . There is no question of inherent superiority or inferiority between these occupational groups , nor is there any evidence that children // born of parents in the professional , managerial , or related groups are genically better than those in the less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the advantages that accrue from education , physical care , and related considerations . World War II saw a rapid increase in the fertility of upper economic groups . The number of children under five of " professional and semiprofessional workers " and " proprietors , managers , and officials , except farm " ( to use the Census classifications ) , was nearly the same as that for " salesmen , " " clerical and kindred workers , " " operatives and kindred workers , " " laborers , except farm and mine , " and " farm laborers . " These latter groups have been comparatively fertile and the relative equality with the professional and managerial groups could only have resulted from a substantial wartime increase in the fertility of the latter . " The number of children of the upper economic groups , " explains the Bureau of the Census , " being more largely under voluntary control than that of the lower economic groups , is more sensitive to temporary changes of an economic or psychological nature . " 19 Both of these changes were apparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income provided the economic foundation for an increased fertility among groups able to control their reproductive activity . Selective Service and the desire to have a child before leaving for military service were among the psychological incentives operating toward the same end . The Bureau of the Census suggests that this high wartime fertility among the middle- and upper-economic groups may also represent " births deferred from prewar depression years or births borrowed from the future . " 20 In the latter event , increased wartime fertility would represent no permanent change in the size of these completed families and hence no permanent modification iii the enduring differentials between social and economic groups . Biological Roles and Contraception . The most important single technical factor modifying the biological role is the knowledge of contraception . Birth control is the term ordinarily employed to describe the limitation of births , although contra- // ception is more accurate . Contraception refers to the use of a specific measure or measures to prevent the union of sperm and ovum . Birth control is the more general term and includes all methods for the interruption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevention thereof . Infanticide and abortion are thus forms of birth control , although these practices are ordinarily far from the mind of the person using the phrase . Underlying the previous discussion of changing biological roles has been the assumption that the knowledge of contraception is widely disseminated and will be increasingly so . For the first time since man has been on earth , a considerable minority ( in the United States a large majority ) of husbands and wives have the technical ability to control ( within limits ) their biological role . This is one of the most momentous changes in the history of marriage . The emphasis throughout this book has rested upon courtship and marriage as social relationships . This emphasis will continue . Hence , there will be no extended discussion of the history of contraception , its legal status , or the techniques by which conception is prevented . Such material is important to marital relationships , but it requires a more detailed and technical discussion than can be given here . The reader should consult the treatises listed at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may properly be supplemented by the family physician , who has the technical competence and the legal right ( in most states ) to impart this information . Marriage counselors and birth-control clinics are also available in many areas for expert advice in this field . The following discussion will therefore deal with contraception only in terms of its effects upon marital relationships . 1 . Economic Relationships . The biological role is strongly influenced by economic factors . We have indicated how such elements as the desire for material success , the pecuniary individualism of our society , and the sheer monetary cost of children have directed biological behavior toward smaller families . The American standard of living , while normally beyond the reach of most Americans , is still an important motivating factor in their conduct . Many young couples entering marriage postpone the first // child until they can " afford " it . This financial status may not be reached until the most desirable age of child bearing has been passed , if ever . In 1940 , almost 15 per cent of the 9 million women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had never had any children . " Many of these childless women were undoubtedly among those who postponed the birth of a child until it was too late . 2 . Social Relationships . Closely allied to the economic factors in the biological role are those arising from the wish to space the birth of children over a " reasonable " period . There are often sound medical reasons for the deliberate spacing of children , in addition to the wish to adapt the family to the income . Contraception is often prescribed by social workers for families in the lower-income groups because of the sheer lack of money for more children . Adequate contraceptive information is often not available to those who need it most , and families in the depressedincome groups continue to have children for whom they can not adequately provide . Whether employed on their own initiative by couples in the middle-income groups or prescribed by social workers for those in the lower , the practice of contraception involves a considerable change in social relationships . 3 . Companionate Relationships . Companionate relationships in this context @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together in this most intimate of all adult groups . Contraception is employed by many couples in a conscious or unconscious effort to maintain the intimacy that can only be experienced by two persons . The introduction of a child brings many complications and alterations in the marital relationship . The majority of husbands and wives desire to alter their ties in this way , but some apparently do not . The adjustments between such couples are so close that they presumably ' do not wish them altered , even by the birth of their own child . These attitudes are permanently held by only a small minority of married couples ; the postponement of a child by contraception during the early // years of marriage is much more common . Many couples marry with the understanding that they will not have a child immediately . They wish to become accustomed to the novelty of their new life without the added complication of a third party . Such an attitude is at variance with the traditional marital role before the wide dissemination of contraceptive information . The ability to control the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 . Sexual Relationships . Husband and wife may now engage in sexual relationships with comparatively little fear of pregnancy . The contemporary attitude toward sex in marriage has come about so gradually that we forget how comparatively recent it is . This does not mean that husbands and wives have always strictly obeyed the implied ecclesiastical discouragement of sex relations in marriage except for the express purpose of procreation . These relations , however , have always carried the possibility of ultimate pregnancy . The open acceptance of sexual pleasure in marriage as a value in its own right has at least partly resulted from the growing assurance that an undesired pregnancy will not ensue . The interest in sex for its own sake has been intimately connected with the growing emphasis upon personal happiness in marriage and the rise of individualistic attitudes in general . We shall consider the affectional role in marriage later . At this point , we may only note that much of the luxurious efflorescence of affection in modern marriage is based upon the employment of contraception . 5 . Health Relationships . Contraception enables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the health of the wife . It also makes it possible to avoid pregnancy because of hereditary factors that would make the birth of children medically unwise . One of the reasons for the erstwhile high maternal mortality was the constant succession of pregnancies , with no intervening period of recuperation . By eliminating or mitigating many of these dangers , contraception has introduced important changes in health relationships . The physical capacities of women vary widely and some women are more able than // others to withstand the physical hazards of childbirth . These differences were foinierly often ignored , and every wife was assumed capable of bearing a long succession of children . The results were often fatal to the wife and in any event decreased her life expectancy . Under present conditions , the health relationships have changed considerably , with resultant benefit to the wife and mother.23 Many thoughtful persons have recognized the changes noted above , but have expressed concern lest the knowledge of contraception prove so seductive that the nation would gradually wither and die . Such a prospect appears remote . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . The norm is still based upon the eventual appearance of one or more children . The number that eventuate is naturally smaller than under earlier conditions , but the philoprogenitive urge is still very much alive . The biological role in marriage continues to change under the impact of social , economic , and cultural factors . Group expectations defining the biological role are also changing , although at a slower rate . A new and smaller family is gradually replacing the old . Chapter XI Prenatal Roles The Nature of Prenatal Roles . Prenatal roles refer to the patterns of behavior of husband and wife between the time of conception and the birth of the child . In the previous chapter , we have examined the biological role and some of the social influences that have modified it in recent years . In the normal course of events , the relationships of the married pair embrace the biological role , then the prenatal , and finally culminate in the parental . The social relationships leading up to pregnancy are important in determining the character and stability of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also important in the total span of the great adventure . In this chapter , we shall consider the pattern of behavior that comprises the prenatal role . The prenatal role is by its very nature a transitory pattern of social relationships . It applies to a limited period in the total marital relationship , although this interval is important in emotional and psychological as well as in physical terms . The relationships between husband and wife during pregnancy embody the spirit of the marriage . This crisis thus may either bring the spouses closer together or force them farther apart . Both are in a somewhat agitated emotional state , induced not only by the physical condition of the wife but also by the realization of the change in status which they are about to undergo as a couple . 186 // The physical safety of the unborn child is clearly the first consideration under these new circumstances , but the emotional status of the marriage relationship itself is also significant . The nature of this prenatal relationship may have as much bearing on marital happiness as any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the modern married pair . In a time of large families and successive pregnancies , the husband and wife had only a short interval between the birth of one child and the next pregnancy . The role of expectant father or mother was almost chronic under these conditions , and many of the elements now associated with this role were not present . The intimacy of the frontier family , the fact that births commonly took place at home , and the lack of medical assistance meant that many girls were vicariously but intimately associated with the process of gestation before they were called upon to play this role themselves . Small families and hospital births today mean that many of the relationships of pregnancy and birth are unfamiliar to the young wife , except in a theoretical sense , before she experiences them . She often has more theoretical knowledge but less actual experience with such matters than her great-grandmother . Husband and wife in the expectant family occupy a new social status . The concept of status refers to the position the individual occupies in society , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of individual effort . An example of assigned ( or ascribed ) status is the position given the individual because of his sex , race , or marital status . Earned ( or achieved ) status is one which the individual gains in our society by making a great deal of money or becoming a great artist . The prenatal status is an assigned one , which all persons in this particular situation occupy when they have succeeded in procreating a child . The status of expectant parent is a recognized one in all societies , with the bulk of the related rights and privileges accruing to the wife because of her physical contribution . The concept of role refers to the active phase of the status and includes the patterns of behavior expected of the individual by virtue of his status . Each status carries with it a certain role , and each role represents a // particular status . The role is thus the " dynamic aspect of a status " and represents the socially accepted behavior appropriate to a given social position . ' When a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereby enter a new status with new roles . This status is ordinarily known only to themselves and the doctor in the early weeks , and thence it is confined to their families and close friends for some time . As the physical signs of pregnancy become unmistakable , the new status becomes known to distant friends and acquaintances and , in the small town , to the community as a whole . The new status and role thus become common knowledge to a gradually widening social circle , leading up to the triumphant fact of the birth of the child . At that time , everyone is supposed to know of and rejoice in the blessed event and every discreet device for publicizing it is employed . The most important change in the pregnancy sequence , however , is undoubtedly that occurring in the relationship of the husband and wife when they are certain of their new status . The marriage and the spouses assume a new air in the eyes of both parties . They are profoundly conscious of their new status and of the new roles that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new status are very clear . The individuals are expected to feel unalloyed joy at their imminent parenthood , a status which they may be attaining for the first or a multiple time . The thought of the new life shortly to be brought into the world is assumed to bring unmixed happiness to all concerned , irrespective of economic status , health , or other considerations . The new role is presumably assumed gladly and willingly and with no qualifications whatever . We shall consider the emotional shades of feeling related to this new role in more detail below . We are concerned here only with painting in broad strokes the conventional attitude toward the new status and role . Children are defined as the greatest gift which life can bestow and as the culmination of , if not the sole reason for , marriage . Thus , the role // called forth by this new status is traditionally suffused with unqualified happiness . These emotions do not always accompany the initial intelligence that a child ( or another child ) is on the way . The emotions actually accompanying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wives are completely and uncritically delighted at the coming event , whether it is the first or the sixth of such visitations . Others do not want children ( or any more children ) and are consciously or unconsciously depressed at the prospect thereof , at least in the initial stage of the process . Still others are ambivalent on the subject , with happiness at their approaching parenthood mingled with apprehension at the additional responsibilities . This apprehension is often dispelled with the birth of the child or even long before the event takes place . The actual presence of the helpless infant may generate an affection and sense of protection that is not evoked by a still hypothetical child in the first few months of its prenatal existence . Emotional reactions to the new status thus differ from one individual to another and from one period to another within the same individual . Other emotions may accompany this new status . The wife may feel a sublime sense of fulfillment of her role as a woman , now that she is about to take an active part in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an expansion of his own ego and a realization of his basic masculinity , now that he has played his part in fathering a child . Together , the couple may begin to plan the career of this new member of the family , whose sex and character are as yet undetermined . They may begin to project their own thwarted hopes and aspirations upon this tiny morsel of life , whose formal debut into the world is still several months distant . For the majority of couples , therefore , this new status is marked by a profound sense of completion . The timing of the prenatal status after the first experience has both physical and social implications . Many physicians maintain that a full two years should elapse between births in order to give the mother time to recover her health completely from the previous experience . This is equivalent to suggesting that some fifteen // months should follow the birth , during which the wife should be free from pregnancy . The reproductive organs can thus return to their previous size and shape , the muscular tone can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the heart and kidneys can function normally without the added load of pregnancy . In addition to the primary health consideration , a considerable period should ideally intervene between births so that the husband , wife , and siblings ( if any ) can adjust socially to the new relationship . As the care of the baby becomes more routinized and less demanding of the complete psychic and physical energies of the wife , her relations with her husband , can return somewhat to their former status . She can devote more attention to him and thereby partially reverse the unusual attention that is perforce directed to the new child . The suggested two-year interval between births and the fifteen-month interval between pregnancies thus permits some necessary readjustments of both physical and social roles . ' Physical Adequacy for Prenatal Roles . The prerequisites for adequate performance of the prenatal and ( ultimately ) the paternal roles arc primarily physical , but they also involve emotional and psychological factors . Physical adequacy refers to the ability of the husband and wife to procreate , conceive , and bear a healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the premarital examinations to which many couples now voluntarily submit . It is measured more directly in the examination which the majority of wives undergo at the first positive signs of pregnancy and during the ensuing months . Before turning to the physical adequacy for performing the prenatal role , however , we may review briefly the ways and means of determining this new status . 1 . Discovery of Pregnancy . The physical signs of this new status are four in number : a . Missing a monthly or menstrual period , especially with women who have previously had normal , regular periods . // b . Changes in the breasts , which become somewhat larger , more tender , and have a stinging or pricking feeling . c . Sickness of the stomach , usually in the morning , comprising what is known as " morning sickness . " d . The desire to pass urine more frequently than is ordinarily the case , especially early in the pregnancy . ' The first of these symptoms , the missing of the menstrual period , is the most conclusive evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the period is missed two consecutive times . When all four symptoms are present simultaneously , the chances are very strong that the wife is pregnant . This probability should be explored immediately by consultation with a physician , who may or may not be able on the first visit to confirm or deny the new status . He may request that the wife return at a later date for further examination or may prescribe a laboratory test which will decide the matter conclusively . Such tests involve the injection of the early morning urine of the woman into the blood stream of a virgin rabbit or mouse . If the woman is pregnant , certain changes will occur within forty-eight hours in the ovarian tissue of the animal . The new status will then have been established without a doubt . ' 2 . Physical Examination . When the fact of pregnancy has been definitely established , the doctor will wish to examine further the physical adequacy of the wife to undertake her new role . The examination will include " ? besides an external abdominal and an internal vaginal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the birth canal ? an examination of the teeth , tonsils , throat , thyroid , heart , lungs , kidneys , and digestive organs . " ' In addition , the doctor will wish to know of any previous history of heart trouble , kidney infection , tuberculosis , rheumatic fever , or other serious ailments . Knowledge // of these or other serious ailments is necessary so that additional necessary precautions may be taken during the ensuing months . 3 . Venereal Disease . The majority of states now require a blood test indicating freedom from venereal disease ( principally syphilis ) before a marriage license is granted . In spite of this factor in the premarital situation , the wise physician will further investigate the physical adequacy of his patient for the prenatal role by administering a Wassermann or other serological test for syphilis at the first visit . If the test is positive , treatment should begin immediately and should be continued throughout the pregnancy . Syphilis is congenital rather than hereditary , which means that the unborn child is infected by the blood stream of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ germ plasm . Vigorous treatment begun before the fifth month of pregnancy will usually mean that the child is born free of the disease . ' 4 . Prenatal Care . " Prenatal care , " says the Children 's Bureau , " is that part of the care of the mother which has as its object the complete supervision of the pregnant woman in order to preserve the happiness , health , and life of the mother and child . " ' The brief statement that follows should not be construed as a substitute for the care of a physician from the first signs of pregnancy through and after the birth of the child . We are merely concerned here in indicating that prenatal care plays an important part in the role of the expectant mother . Many of her most important social relationships will revolve about her periodic visits to the doctor and the changes in regimen which he proposes . Hence , the problem of prenatal care is a social , as well as a physical , consideration . The length of time of the prenatal role is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last monthly period until the probable time of birth . Counting thirty days to the month , the 280 days will be a few days longer than the exact nine months proverbially considered as the time of pregnancy . // During this long interval , the doctor will wish to see the mother " at least once a month during the first six months , every 2 weeks or oftener in the next 2 months , and every week in the last month . " ' At each of these visits , he will observe her general mental and physical condition , take her blood pressure , analyze her urine , and check her weight . If she can not afford a private physician , the prospective mother should , if possible , go to a prenatal center or clinic , where expert medical attention will be provided on an adjusted financial basis . Whatever the source of the medical advice ? whether private or clinic physician ? she should follow the advice carefully and modify her social and physical relationships accordingly . We can not consider the hygiene of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unimportant but because of lack of space . Included in this topic are such matters as proper diet , exercise and rest , elimination , clothing , and care of the body . These are matters on which the advice of the physician should be followed explicitly , for the folk wisdom handed down through the family is not adequate . Emotional and psychological factors are also involved in this change of status and role . The wife about to undergo this vital ( if temporary ) change in status should therefore remember that " she is like an athlete in training for a race or a swimming contest , who lives according to the rules that have been worked out to give him the best possible preparation for the test that he will have to meet . Her test is her confinement , and the goal is health for the baby and herself . " 9 Physical Difficulties and Prenatal Roles . Certain physical factors may interfere with the performance of the prenatal role . These factors may be completely beyond the control of the spouses , or they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider these two physical difficulties in some detail . 1 . Sterility . The first of these is sterility . Contrary to the expectations of most married couples , the ability to conceive a child can not be taken for granted . In practice , some 14 per cent of all married couples will not be physically able to have children , even // though the great majority probably want them at some time or another during their married life . Of this 14 per cent , approximately half can be aided by medical or surgical means to have children , but the other half will remain permanently childless . The aid may result from consultation with the doctor by couples who have been unable to initiate a pregnancy or carry one to a successful conclusion . " The process whereby a wife becomes pregnant is extremely complex . It involves a whole series of steps that must be carried out successfully if conception is to take place . Fertility involves ( among others ) the following conditions : normal spermatozoa produced by the testicles of the male ; free passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe reception of this discharge by the female cervix and its passage through the uterus to the Fallopian tubes ; production of normal ova ; and the final union of spermatozoa and ova . Difficulties may arise in certain vital segments of this elaborate dual process , which involves the adequate functioning of both sexes . Nature may be able to overcome impediments in some of these processes without outside aid , but others require medical or surgical attention to ensure fertility . " Failure to bring about fertility may reflect difficulties in either male or female or both . Sterility is apparently caused in most cases by multiple factors that can be traced to the male in some instances , to the female in others , and to both parties in still others . Couples unable to qualify for the prenatal role may thus discover , upon examination , that the causes of sterility are multiple and can not be attributed solely to one or the other . In view of the extreme complexity of the physiology of conception , however , the wonder is that so many people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without unusual difficulty or artificial assistance . Commenting upon this tenacity of nature , // a noted clinician remarked : " In relative fertility , the reproductive process is successfully initiated in spite of certain obstacles , which as a rule do not exceed two in number . Nature is often able to overcome one or two impedances. . . . " 12 2 . Abortion . Even when it has been successfully initiated , the prenatal role may be brought to a premature termination . This may occur either through voluntary or involuntary means . The terms " miscarriage " and " abortion " are used interchangeably to describe this interruption , which refers to " the birth of the child before it is sufficiently developed to be able to live outside its monther 's body ? that is , before the end of the sixth month of pregnancy . " 13 This interruption may take three different forms : a . SPONTANEOUS ABORTION . Spontaneous abortion results when the expulsion of the fetus occurs " naturally " and without artificial interference . b . THERAPEUTIC ABORTION . Therapeutic abortion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to interrupt the pregnancy if the life of the mother is or will be seriously endangered by its continuance . c . CRIMINAL ABORTION . Criminal abortion is the deliberate interruption of the pregnancy by the wife herself , by a physician , midwife , or other more or less trained person when the sole object is to get rid of the child . Such abortions are everywhere prohibited by statute . However different the means and motives , all three types of abortion have the same result , namely , the termination of the pregnancy before the normal birth of the child.14 Recent knowledge has dispelled many of the erroneous conceptions formerly held concerning the causes of spontaneous abortion . It was once believed that shock , grief , fear , or severe emotional experiences tended to cause abortion , but such is apparently not the case , provided that the pregnancy is normal . Many forms of exercise , including stretching , bending , lifting , stooping , // and similar exertions , were also believed to present danger of abortion . These too have been relegated to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell of fresh paint have any demonstrable relationship to abortion ; neither does sexual intercourse , conducted with moderation and care . Traveling , whether by automobile , airplane , or train , seems to have no ill effects upon a normal embryo . It is true that some of the above factors may , on occasion , bring about the expulsion of a defective embryo , but their effect upon the normal embryo is negligible . When the embryo is normal , it apparently can not be shaken loose from the mother any more than a normal fruit can be dislodged by a storm from the tree before it is ripe . By way of illustrating this point , a well-known gynecologist tells of a patient who jumped from a cliff in order to induce abortion . She fractured both legs but delivered a normal baby at the appropriate time.15 The most frequent cause of spontaneous abortion is defective germ plasm . One authoritative study reports that 70 per cent of all such abortions investigated were caused by this factor . The physiological implications of this situation are too complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourths of all cases in which the pregnancy is spontaneously terminated result from this condition . In these cases , the fetus is dead some time before its expulsion , whereas in the 30 per cent of the cases not caused by defective germ plasm , the fetus is alive and apparently normal before it is expelled . Abortion under the latter conditions may result from abnormalities of the reproductive organs , severe illness of the mother , and many other factors of whose nature authorities are frankly undecided . The important consideration is , however , that the majority of spontaneous abortions are apparently caused by factors in the germ plasm over which the husband and wife have no control . " The number of pregnancies terminated by abortion is not exactly known . Estimates for all forms of abortion run from // 7 00,00017 to 2,000,00018 annually , with an estimated 70 per cent of the total consisting of illegal abortions . The nature of this situation clearly precludes any accurate tabulation of spontaneous , therapeutic , or illegal abortions . Whatever the actual number of the latter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die every year after illegal abortions , the majority of which are conducted under dangerously unhygienic conditions . Contrary to the general impression , the great majority ( some authorities say 90 per cent ) of all illegal abortions occur among married rather than single women . These women already have several children and do not want any more.19 Only a minority of illegal abortions are performed upon unmarried women , who are attempting thereby to remove the tangible evidence of their sexual indiscretions . Without knowledge of contraception , married women in the **26;128;TOOLONG age group who have several children may find abortion the only means at their disposal for limiting the size of their families . Poverty is apparently the most important factor in causing many women to take this drastic and dangerous step . One more child in an already large family may be more than the mother can face . The emotional and physical dangers of this action are very great . The prenatal role should not be terminated under these conditions . Prenatal Social Roles . The great majority of husbands and wives suffer neither from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its normal conclusion . During these months , they are playing a role that is new to them but is forever old to mankind as a whole . Certain nuances of the role change as pregnancy advances , with both parties subject to differing expectations and limitations as the physical condition of the wife changes . As confinement approaches , the social as well as the affectional life of the couple becomes more restricted . Their life // becomes increasingly centered in the coming child . This pattern is , of course , subject to modification if the couple already has one or more children . In this event , the roles of both husband and wife are more diffuse and are directed at the children already there as well as the new one on the way . We are concerned here for the most part , however , with the changing role of the husband and wife who are entering upon their initial pregnancy . The new prenatal roles are directed toward the mental , as well as the physical , health of the prospective parents . " Pregnancy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a disease , but it is nature under a strain . ' . . . The mother . . . should not think of herself as an invalid just because she is pregnant , nor should her friends . She is to be envied , not sympathized with . " 20 Hence , the mother should not be afraid for either herself or her baby . Her role is one that has already been successfully played by untold billions of women before her and will continue to be played by similar billions after her . Hence , fear of such visitations as " birthmarks " or " maternal impressions " should not concern the mother or father . The alleged communication between the nervous system of the mother and that of the unborn child , whereby the child may be " marked " because the mother sees something repulsive or has an unpleasant experience , is completely fictitious . In the rare event that " markings " or other deformities do occur in the child , they have been present since the earliest weeks of pregnancy and have nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental poise is something the wife must largely work out for herself , since she is the one primarily concerned . Nevertheless , the husband may play his part in the process . He can , for example , indicate his understanding that his role is changing by offering to help about the house to a greater extent than formerly . He can show his sympathy in many small ways with the difficulties which his wife is undergoing and about to undergo . He can demonstrate that he is fully aware of the collaborative nature of their effort and thus make it clear that he // is anxious to assist to his utmost ability in the pregnancy , birth , and subsequent care of the child . Conjugal affection is very precious under these conditions , with the husband doing his best to lighten the burden ( figuratively and literally ) borne by his wife . His behavior should be increasingly marked by sympathetic cooperation in this new and absorbing joint enterprise . Prenatal social roles have changed considerably in recent decades , along with the rise of greater frankness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife went into semiretirement after two or three months of pregnancy and remained there until well after the birth of the child ? that day has gone with the bustle and the hobble skirt . The Victorian prudery that insisted that women should be as inconspicuous as possible during pregnancy has also been largely dispelled . The false shame that kept prospective mothers from appearing in public after the first signs of pregnancy has almost disappeared . Modern young mothers attempt to make no secret of their condition . The role of prospective parent is thus accepted proudly and with a minimum of the hypocritical shame that once characterized it , especially among middle- and upper-class people . This new acceptance of the prenatal role means in effect that the role itself has changed . Despite this increased freedom of the pregnant wife in recent years , certain limitations still inevitably arise to curtail the physical activities of the couple and hence modify their respective social roles . As the wife passes into the later months of pregnancy , the social life of the couple becomes more moderate , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening to the radio and reading the paper thus take the place of those spent dancing or otherwise carrying on the leisure-time activities of the engagement and early marriage periods . If the husband is properly sympathetic toward these transient but very real physical limitations , he will accept the new status and not urge the wife to do more than her strength dictates . In this sense , the prenatal role is an apprenticeship for the paternal role , when the lives of both husband and wife will be drastically and permanently changed . The physical changes // in the wife during pregnancy therefore prepare both parties for the more thorough modification in behavior once the baby has arrived . If the wife is gainfully employed , the prenatal role will sooner or later bring about an obvious change in her economic role . The length of time she will wish to continue her work will depend upon such factors as the nature of the employment , the economic status of the family , her own physical condition , and the attitude of her husband . Some wives will continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially in view of the impending increase in the family expenses ; others will retire from the labor market as soon as possible and devote themselves entirely to their new role . Under normal conditions , the wife may continue to work until the sixth month without endangering her health or that of the baby , provided that she can get sufficient rest and avoid excessive fatigue . Some authorities , indeed , recommend the continuation of employment as long as physically possible in order to relieve the wife of undue preoccupation with her own symptoms . A further important consideration in understanding social roles is the attitude of the individual toward his own role . In the prenatal relationship , this problem pertains especially to the husband . The central function of the wife in the process of gestation is obvious . The role of the husband is considerably more marginal , once the process has begun . Hence , the latter may feel , consciously or unconsciously , that the physical and emotional preparations for the baby indicate a diminution of the affection of the wife toward himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus be one of vague frustration and uneasiness . In all probability , however , these attitudes will remain latent and will not mar the relationship between two emotionally mature persons . At the same time , it would be unrealistic to maintain that the relationships between husband and wife remain exactly the same as before . They do not . Moreover , the marital relationship will never return to the carefree companionship pattern of the dating , engagement , and early married periods . Husbands who // expect their wives to be perpetual companions , completely footloose and able to engage in any adventure , will inevitably be disappointed . Such expectations are essentially immature , since society demands the eventual acceptance of the adult role , carrying with it the responsibilities of marriage and children . Husbands and wives unable to make this transition with equanimity thereby reveal their immaturity and their comparative inadequacy for parenthood . The pregnant wife inevitably sacrifices much of the irresponsible companionship that was so charming when she was a young girl . The young mother is even less able to devote her complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most couples accept this change of status and role , with all that it entails for their future lives . We have considered the behavior patterns associated with the prenatal role largely as if this were the first such experience of the couple . The initial adjustment is probably the most difficult in this respect . With one or more children already in the family , husband and wife have , as it were , become veterans of the prenatal role and have made the initial adjustment . As noted , this role is no longer the routine experience that it was in the days when many families were in the prenatal status for a good part of their productive years . One or two children are an increasingly common occurrence in the middle-class family , and hence , the prenatal role is unfamiliar , or at least a rare experience , for many families . Because of this very infrequency , this role involves greater emotional overtones . Prenatal Emotional Reactions . Closely related to the social relationships of the prenatal period are the emotional accImpaniments . These reactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the marriage itself . Husbands and wives who have been neurotic and insecure will not be magically changed into mature and secure persons when the wife becomes pregnant . A marriage characterized by basic conflicts and frustrations will not have these difficulties suddenly resolved by this change in status . Maturity and immaturity , security and insecurity will merely be accentuated by the new status and by the new role that the spouses are perforce adopting . // Nothing is so productive of sobriety as the knowledge that one is soon to become a father or mother , unless it is the actual experience thereof . The immature person has hitherto taken more out of life than he has put into it and has managed to gain sympathy and attention without contributing his share . In his role as prospective parent , he must change his former pattern if he is to succeed . He must give sympathy , understanding , and moral support to his wife during the months ahead . He may have to shoulder some of the physical burdens of housekeeping in addition to the economic load @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is about to have greater responsibility and less personal freedom than heretofore . Success in this adjustment means that the individual enters one of the great crises of life under happy circumstances . Failure may mean that his own life , that of his wife , and that of his unborn child will be insecure , maladjusted , and unhappy . Considerable intrinsic difference exists between the emotional reactions of the wife and those of the husband . The changes occurring in the wife are manifestly physical and are crucial to the gestation and birth of the child . The wife does not have to be instructed as to her reactions to the same extent as the husband , for hers are physiologically based . Those of the husband , on the other hand , are largely cultural in origin , since the change he is experiencing is purely a social one . He is learning to play the role first of prospective and then of actual father , a relationship that is defined more by society than by nature . This does not imply that the prenatal role of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vary in the slightest with the social setting . Society defines the role of the wife as well as that of the husband , and these definitions vary from one society to another . However , the vital function of the wife is clearly visible in the process of having a child , whereas the role of the husband has to be established by society . He has to be taught how to become a father . Once conception has taken place , the unborn child can theoretically dispense with his father ? but not with his mother . In her prenatal role , the wife is obviously fulfilling her central female function , a process that will increasingly enlist her energy and attention during the coming months . Many wives tend to // turn inward upon themselves ? or rather upon the new life within them ? and become extremely introverted during pregnancy . In Freudian terms , the mother is becoming conscious of a nonego as well as an ego within her , a new life that is at once part of her and something new . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the new life to assume an independent existence . She thus makes certain mental as well as physical preparations for the child during the months when it is still part of her own ego . As one psychiatrist has put it , " For no matter how passive and introverted , how careless and helpless , how intellectually and emotionally absorbed , how rich or poor , how proud or ashamed of her pregnancy the woman may be , she is seized at this time by a nest-building activity , a need to build , on a large or small scale , for the expected child . " 22 These feelings of completion and fruition may be complicated in the expectant mother by fears of the possible loss of attractiveness of face and figure , especially if this is one of a number of pregnancies . The cult of romantic love places great emphasis upon maintaining a youthful and glamorous figure as long as possible , a feat that becomes more difficult as the number of children increases . The wife may therefore experience certain ambivalent emotions , both conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be complete happiness at her role , whereas another may involve the fear of a possible loss of attractiveness . In most cases , the pleasurable sensations will overcome the fearful ones , especially in those mature unions where the husband has demonstrated his affection for the wife as a companion and mother , rather than as a perpetual romantic companion . The role of the wife may be further complicated by the necessity of adjusting her husband emotionally to his new status and assuring him of his continued importance in the family . For some men , the wife early assumes the role of mother substitute , as well as wife and companion , and the husband leans upon her as a prop to his own insecurity . The imminent coming of a child may bring additional insecurity to such husbands , since the bulk of // the wife 's attention is perforce directed toward the new member of the family . The wife then has the dual function of providing psychic support for both herself and her husband at the very time when she herself needs all possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marital relationships , on the other hand , pregnancy represents a tangible fulfillment of his maleness . He glories in his new role and therefore tends to play it adequately and completely.23 A final emotional aspect of the prenatal role is the problem of sexual intercourse . We shall consider the sexual relationship in more detail in a later chapter . This relationship does not constitute by any means the whole of the affectional role in marriage , but it does symbolize it . That is , the sex act is the symbol of the complete marital union among persons of all social groups . The deprivation of the sex relationship over a prolonged period , except in cases of absence or illness , is considered a serious symptom of marital incompatibility . Hence , the question of sex relations during the prenatal period is of great symbolic , as well as emotional , significance . For many women , pregnancy is marked by a heightened interest in sexual intercourse and a greater pleasure therein . Several factors may combine to cause this situation . For many women , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to have sexual intercourse without fear of pregnancy , since they are either ignorant of contraceptive information or constrained not to use any " mechanical " devices for this purpose . With the fear of unwanted pregnancy temporarily exorcised , they may enjoy the sex relationship more freely than at any other time . The realization of this new status and role may also draw a couple closer together and unite them in every possible emotional and physical sense . Sexual intercourse may be both the symbol of this new status and its complete emotional expression.24 The sexual act may thus assume greater importance at this // time than at any other period in the marital relationship . Medical authorities state that there is no reason why sexual intercourse should not be continued until approximately two months before the time of delivery . Care should be used during the time of each month when the period would be taking place if the wife were not pregnant , since abortion is most common at this time . Sex relationships should be stopped completely during the final two months of pregnancy because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If such bacteria remain in the birth canal at the time of delivery , infection of the uterus may occur , with accompanying serious results . By exercising care and restraint at the time of the normal period and refraining altogether during the final two months , the couple can thus continue their normal sex relationships during the greater part of the prenatal period.25 The prenatal role is further symbolized by the act of sexual intercourse during this period . The spouses are normally drawn closely together in the anticipation of their forthcoming parental status and their sexual relationships consummate this fact . At the same time , the act should be conducted with care in order to avoid abortion or injury to the mother or child . Gentleness and consideration are thus combined with sexual passion during this time when both parties are undergoing psychological changes and one is also undergoing physical changes . Physically , psychologically , and emotionally , the prenatal status and role bring adjustments in their wake . These adjustments may be made maturely by adult men and women ; they may be bungled by immature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the other social expectations comprising the marital relationship , reflects the personalities of those who play it . Chapter XII Parents and Children The Nature of Parental Roles . The birth of the first child changes a marriage into a family . With this happy event , marital roles undergo certain fundamental changes . We have seen some of the social factors that influence the biological role toward fewer or more children . We have also traced the relationships of husband and wife through the prenatal roles and up to the birth of the child . This book deals primarily with the relationships of courtship and marriage , rather than with the institutional pattern of the family . This emphasis upon marriage rather than upon the family obviously does not question the supreme importance of the latter , but merely arises from the fact that , in the emerging academic division of labor , separate courses are offered in each of these related fields . At the same time , the roles of parents comprise an integral part of the total pattern of marriage . This chapter will deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role of parent , the individual assumes one of the most powerful patterns of group expectations known to any society . These expectations differ from one society to another and from one class or subculture to another within the same society . The emphasis throughout this discussion has been upon the patterns of courtship and marriage assumed in the middleclass , urban , white , native-born group to which the great majority of our readers belong . We shall continue this emphasis in our consideration of parental roles , since the problem of adjust-206 // ing behavior to expectations for most of our readers involves adjustments on this broad social level . Furthermore , the recent changes in parental ( and related ) behavior are more pervasive among the large and amorphous middle class than among the native-born farmers or the foreign-born urban population . Many of the difficulties arising from the changing patterns of marriage and the family are experienced most dramatically at this middle-class urban level . Adjustments in parental roles are among the most acute of these problems . Parental roles also differ with the age and number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an only child clearly differ from those involving several siblings . The increasing number of families with one or two children means that roles based upon such numerical relationships will be more common in the future . This situation is contrasted to a former condition , when the proportion of families with three or more children was considerably higher than today . In 1790 , for example , there were 3.0 children under twenty-one per family , whereas in 1940 there were only 1.3 . The decade of 1930 to 1940 saw a decrease in the percentage of families with three or more children under twenty-one from 24.3 to 18.1 per cent of the total . The same period saw a decrease in the proportion of all families with one or more children under twenty-one from 61.2 per cent to 55.7 per cent of the total . Parental roles in future decades will probably continue on this general numerical level . The decline in the size of the family has made children more precious than ever before . They have become human commodities that must be physically protected at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be managed with the greatest care by the parents . Each individual child has thus presumably become more valuable , both in his own right and as an expression of the parental ego . Parents wish to do all they can for their children , primarily because they love them , but // also because they may ( unconsciously ) wish to use the children to compensate for their own past frustrations . Whatever the reason , the individual child has probably become more precious , and parental roles have changed accordingly . This has been called the " century of the child . " ' But the parent is becoming increasingly conscious of his own role in this new era . Parental roles also differ according to the age status of the children . The relationships of parents to children obviously change as the latter pass through infancy , childhood , adolescence , and on into maturity . The needs of the child change as he progresses from infancy toward increasing self-sufficiency . His need for physical care is greatest at birth and diminishes during the years thereafter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for himself physically . The final stage of the parental role is built about the " empty nest , " when the children have grown and the mother and father are left to adjust themselves as best they can to their new status . The many ramifications of these relationships can hardly be covered in a chapter , or , indeed , in a volume . ' We can only indicate here very briefly some of the implications of these roles in the framework of social relationships that comprise the family . The role of parent is a rewarding one . We are accustomed to think largely in terms of the many contributions made by the parents to the health and welfare of the child . The relationship between parents and children is by no means unilateral , however , for children are more than passive recipients of the ministrations evoked by the parental role . We shall consider below some of the rewards , satisfactions , and frustrations deriving from success or failure in living up to the social expectations in this respect . We are concerned here with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributions made by children to parents . Some of these contributions are derived from // the mere presence of children and represent complications as well as satisfactions . Others grow out of the emotional overtones of the parental role itself . ' 1 . The Complexity of Family Relationships . The presence of one or more children obviously increases the complexity of the marital roles . The initial relationships of marriage involve husband and wife alone . In this book , we have devoted the bulk of our attention thereto . The coming of the first child increases the number of relationships within the marriage ( now the family ) group and thereby fundamentally changes the nature of these relationships . Parental roles represent a realization of this numerical increase and of a corresponding increase in complexity . Each new child added to the family increases the complexity of the group situation . The environment of the first child undergoes corresponding changes with the birth of one or more siblings and as the number of possible interrelationships increases . This commonplace factor of numbers is of fundamental importance in the relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second another , and so on . 2 . Expansion of Family Interests . A second accompaniment of the parental role is the expansion of interests resulting from the fact of the existence of children . In addition to the interest in the development of the child , other considerations arise from the presence of children . Matters of the structure of the home , family finances , insurance , education , community influences , churches , recreational facilities , and the like become suddenly more important when a couple has a child . One of the primary concerns of the young parents is to live in a community providing the best possible physical and moral surroundings for children ; hence , the urge to move to the suburbs after the first child is born . In a broader sense , the future of the nation and of the world has a deeper meaning for people with children than for childless couples or single persons . The parent has indeed " given hostages to fortune , " and the details of that fortune as well as its general outlines are of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plumbing to the atomic bomb assume a new significance to the parent . 3 . Emotional Satisfactions . The presence of children involves emotional satisfactions that can be found in no other way . Some persons find fulfillment in worldly attainment , but the majority are probably unable to do so . These disappointed adults , balked of their goal by forces outside their knowledge or control , derive a very real satisfaction from association with their children and their children 's children . In their early adult years , the parents are often occupied with their own advancement and careers ; but as they grow older , they become increasingly interested in the small successes of their children and derive a deep satisfaction therefrom . Such an interest is not completely unselfish , since the parental ego is thus indirectly served . Much of this interest , however , is as disinterested as it is possible for human behavior to be . 4 . Emotional Projection . The child gives the parent a chance to live his life again , in a sense , and thereby profit from his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempting to live life through him is called " projection . " Such a practice is , like many other accompaniments of the parental role , a two-edged sword , for the parent may force the child to adopt a career that the child does not desire . Frustration of both parent and child may result from this well-meant action . On the whole , however , the opportunities that children give the parent to recapitulate his life vicariously undoubtedly contribute to his peace of mind and enrich his experience . Whatever the ultimate results of this practice of parental projection , it is an important characteristic of the parental role . The parent lives through the child and derives a new experience in the process . 5 . Control of Human Development . The parental role also implies control over the development of one or more human beings , at least in the early years of the child 's life . The sense of power derived from this relationship brings certain conscious or unconscious satisfactions to the parent , not only by dominating another and weaker person but by contributing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling is especially poignant when that other person is ( more or less ) made in your own // the implications of the parental role to the personality of the child . The nature of these roles and the way they are played are important in deciding whether or not the child will develop a well-adjusted personality . The family is the principal agency whereby the cultural heritage is transmitted from one generation to the next . Many of the folkways , mores , expectations , and roles that determine personality are learned in the parental family . The child learns his cultures through the medium of his family ; 7 that is , his mother and father interpret his culture , and he learns it as they present it . His conceptions of social values , religious ideals , and family ethics are primarily those of his parents , who have learned them from their own parents and so on back through the generations . This does not mean that the process of cultural transmission occurs exactly , that the children learn verbatim the interpretations of their parents , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pattern is transmitted , it is reinterpreted and changed . Thus , the child acquires the cultural values of his grandparents through the direct interpretation of his parents . Hence , the immediate social influence upon the child is exerted by his own parents , but beyond that is the influence that their parents exerted upon them . In this way , traditional cultural influences take form , and the personality of the child takes shape . The family is thus the principal relationship that defines the social situation for the child , who enters the world innocent of all standards , values , and morality . The agents in this defining process are primarily the mother and father , although the siblings also play a considerable part . The definition of the social situation means exactly what it says : namely , the process by which actions and thoughts are given social significance . The child has no innate idea of these meanings and must perforce acquire them from others . His father and mother are the most convenient source of this education . Furthermore , they carry great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents for definitions of right and wrong . The child is thus de- // pendent upon others in acquiring the meaning of life . " The child , " says William I. Thomas , " is always born into a group of people among whom all the general types of situation which may arise have already been defined and corresponding rules of conduct developed , and where he has not the slightest chance of making his definitions and following his wishes without interference . " 8 The situations defined by the parents range from such elementary matters as eating , toilet training , and etiquette to the cosmic questions of God , free will , and immortality . Some of these definitions are made deliberately by the parents by way of providing precepts for the child to follow . Others are made spontaneously , with the parents reacting unthinkingly to particular situations in a certain way and thereby defining them for the child . Parental reaction toward early sexual manifestations of the child , for example , may so define this type of behavior for him that the judgment may linger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life . Many of these definitions are learned long before the actual situation is encountered . The average individual thus has acquired his definition of sexual intercourse long before he actually experiences it . In this defining role , the family is only one of the educational influences affecting the behavior of the child . The play group , the school , and the church are other agencies that perform this same function . But the family is the most important . The educational primacy of the family means , in effect , that the personalities of the parents are extremely important to the emergent personality of the child . The personality of the father and mother will determine the way in which they will play their respective parental roles . The parent who has never reached intellectual and emotional maturity will continue to act as an immature person toward his children . The resulting effects upon the plastic personalities in his care may be disastrous . The wife who has never considered anyone but herself may resent the added attention demanded by her child . As a result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely or overwhelm him with attention in an unconscious attempt to overcome her own guilt feelings arising from her initial rejection . The father who has been a spoiled child of an adoring mother may resent the attention given by his wife to his own son . In these and many other ways , the personality of the child is adversely affected by the immaturity and insecurity of the parents . The child in the family where both parents are mature may , on the other hand , derive a deep sense of emotional security that will permanently characterize his personality . He will accept his proper place in the family circle , with neither overprotection nor neglect , since both of these reactions stem from the immaturity or insecurity of the parents . He will be treated as an end in himself , rather than a means to the gratification of the parental ego or a compensation for frustrated parental hopes . He will be free to develop as his abilities warrant , but will be denied license to do exactly as he pleases , without regard for the welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these and many other ways the child will reflect the maturity or immaturity of his parents , who may thus serve either as adequate mentors for his formative years or as slender emotional reeds for him to lean upon . In either event , he will reflect the personalities of his parents and the adequacy with which they play their parental roles . These roles will be accompanied by both frustration and satisfaction . The frustrations in parental roles may occur on the dayto-day level or they may grow out of the entire life of the child . Frustration has been defined as " an interference with the occurrence of an instigated goal-response at its proper time in the behavior sequence . " ' When the spouse does not get the affection he expects from the other , he may be frustrated . He may feel that he has been cheated because he is not loved as completely as he expects to be . Husbands and wives complain that the love of the other has been shifted from them to the child . Husbands may sense that the son dominates the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left for the father . The wife // may resent the attention lavished by the father upon his daughter . In either case , an interference has taken place in an " instigated goal-response , " and the parent is not happy about it . Other frustrations may arise in the daily ( and nightly ) life of the parents , as they are forced to modify their normal schedule to take care of the child . Their social life is necessarily sacrificed to the childish demands , which , especially at first , know no limits . Many of the routine activities of the parents are interrupted , thus literally producing frustration on this level . In the early weeks and months , the child requires almost constant care and the most watchful attention . He must be fed and changed , regardless of the convenience of the parents . Someone must be with him or near by at all times , lest some accident happen to him . His feeding time and play time determine the activities of the others , irrespective of their previous routine . His complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family be oriented about himself , and thus his unconscious imperiousness knows no bounds . He is indeed the tyrant of the home . At a more advanced age level , frustration may characterize parental roles and thus modify the personalities of parents and children alike . Expectations of the abilities and attainments of the children may not be realized , as the latter fail to live up to the hopes of their parents . Parents project their own aspirations onto their children and hope that the young people may somehow salvage more out of life than they ( the parents ) have managed to . As noted , this projection is one of the compensations of the parental role , provided that the parents are sufficiently mature to accept the frustrations that , as often as not , occur to their fondest hopes . Some parents react to such frustration by aggression against the children , without realizing that the child is not at fault for his failure to meet an impossible standard . The mature parent will accept this situation philosophically , even as he has already accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The immature parent will often make matters worse by continuing to demand the impossible of his child . The satisfactions accompanying the parental roles , however , // usually far outweigh the frustrations . The affection of the parent for the newborn and helpless child is one of the most unselfish of all human sentiments and is a positive good in its own right . These sentiments are reinforced by the powerful expectations of our society , which define parenthood as the most desirable state . Parents are thus performing a social role that grows out of their deepest instinctual beings and at the same time embodies the most exalted social approbation . Society approves of parenthood with almost complete unanimity , the only dissenters being a misanthropic few whose hopes have been somehow frustrated by the inevitable vicissitudes of life . Characterizing what he aptly terms " the pathos of parenthood , " Waller indicates the attitude of the sympathetic observer toward the parent . In this attitude , he says , there are " implicit the pathos of the mores , pity and love for the dependence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , approval of the father , a touch of envy for one who has the privilege of being a parent . " 10 Maternal and Paternal Roles . We may consider certain aspects of the maternal and paternal roles as found in our culture . Like the other culture patterns that determine our behavior , many of the basic features of the parental roles are acquired early in life . The little girl is exposed to many of the expectations of the maternal role by both the example of her own mother and the precepts that she receives from other sources . Similarly , the little boy soon acquires the rudiments of the paternal role as currently practiced in his own family and in his immediate subculture . The importance of this early training in role taking is emphasized by authorities on child guidance . " It is not too much to say , " testifies Lawrence K. Frank , " that the ability of men and women to marry and to find happiness in marriage and family life is largely conditioned by their experience and acceptance of their masculine or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 1 . The Maternal Role . The maternal role is a central social // relationship of the family . The mother is entrusted with the care and early training of the child , in addition to the central part which she plays in his physical creation . The reciprocal roles of mother and child may well have constituted the earliest antecedent of the contemporary family.12 Certainly these roles now comprise the central parental relationship , with the father necessarily playing a somewhat peripheral part , especially during the early years . The mother is constantly in contact with the child , feeding it , caring for its physical needs , listening to its first cries , directing its first steps , and forming its first words . No other relationship has such a lasting impression upon the personality as that of mother and child . The extreme plasticity of the infant means that this initial relationship moulds his personality as no other force can . The role of the mother involves the emotional security that is so necessary to the successful development of personality . The mother can offer or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chief source of love in the life of the infant . The mother 's role is that of the unselfish giver of love and in so doing she satisfies one of the child 's basic needs . The all-embracing and undemanding affection of the mother is perhaps the most important single requirement for the early security of the child . His world is largely what his mother makes it , for she comes in constant and intimate contact with him . A world marked by her affection will thus be a secure world , whereas one marked by hostility or rejection will be an insecure one . The child 's body needs food and attention . His personality needs love . The outpouring of affection in the maternal role is especially necessary to the inner security of the child during his first weeks and months . The sudden change from the security of the womb to the hazards of the world constitutes a traumatic experience that requires special attention on the part of the mother . In this early period , fondling and physical demonstrations of maternal affection are important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs intimate and continued contact with his // mother 's body , under conditions as nearly approaching the prenatal state as possible . Clinical experience has shown that breastfeeding plays an important part in this early atmosphere of affectionate security . Through the sense of touch , the child receives the necessary affection that he craves.13 The maternal role and its anticipated response in the child constitutes the foundation of Freudian psychology . The " family romance " has been considered by Freud and his followers as more important in determining personality than any other single experience . The fundamental relationship in the Freudian pattern is that of the mother-son , dramatized as the Oedipus complex , and sometimes involving the undue affection of the child for his mother.Y4 It is not necessary to consider any pathological manifestations of the family experience , however , to appreciate the close affection between the child and his mother . The reciprocal roles of mother-child are perhaps the most intimate that the individual ever experiences and as such have a lasting effect upon his personality . This affectionate maternal solicitude for the welfare of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it is obviously inappropriate for his later years . We shall see below some of the difficulties attending the undue affection and overprotection growing out of the maternal role . This role must early develop training and discipline , which inevitably involves the frustration of some momentary childish urges . No individual can always carry out his desires at the time and in the same form as he experiences them , least of all the child . This is true of his early feeding , toilet training , and related activities . He must be trained to manage his own visceral tensions in the fashion approved by society . He is soon forced to eat when he is fed , not whenever he is hungry . He is perforce trained to control his emotions . He learns to release them under appropriate circumstances , repress them entirely , or direct them into other socially approved chan- // nels . The mother plays the central role in this manifold process of social adaptation . Hence , her role must involve authority and discipline as well as unspecialized affection if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Paternal Role . The paternal role in the contemporary conjugal family is less intimate than that of the mother . This is especially true of the middle- and upper-class family , where the father is away from home during the day and sees the children only for a few moments in the morning and evening . He is expedted to provide the monetary support of the family , but the child-raising function is left largely to the mother . He may assist spasmodically with feeding , clothing , and changing the baby , but his activity is limited by his absence from the home . Much of the discipline is similarly intrusted to the mother , since she is present when the offense occurs . The father enters the home as a periodic guest , whose daily return is an important event in the lives of the children . The very fact that his return is an event , however , testifies to its relatively brief duration . The role of the father in the hour-to-hour care of the child is ordinarily a limited one . The central position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child would seem to establish a secondary role for the father for purely biological reasons . This is by no means universally the case . In many cultures , the father plays an important role in the early care of the child as well as in its later development . Thus , he may feed and clothe the child while the mother works in the fields and may amuse the child and instruct it in the traditions of the group . He may teach the child many of the skills necessary for participation in his society , and he may indoctrinate the child in the religious and social values of his culture . He may do all of these things and more , thereby performing many of the activities generally performed by the mother in our society . The role of the American father reflects the economic and social conditions that have taken him out of the home and limited his daily contact with the children . Other factors have also combined to produce this cultural pattern whereby the father plays a secondary , although by no means unimportant , role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society combine to produce this role , and each father attempts to carry out the behavior demanded of him . The role of the father is more intermittent than that of the mother . In the life of the infant and child , the attentions of the father are confined to the limited relationships ordinarily lasting only a few moments out of the day . As the child grows older , the father sees him under certain special circumstances , which carry a growing influence upon the child 's personality but are still probably not so important as those of the mother . These parental attentions are largely confined to the recreational periods , whereas those of the mother comprise the constant contacts of the workaday world . The average father accepts this situation without question , for he has been prepared for his role from early cihldhood , and he derives satisfaction from playing his role in a manner satisfactory to society . The paternal role furthermore does not embody any such paternal dominance in our society as characterizes those societies in which the patriarchal family is found . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted the absences of any arbitrary authority for the father and the delegation of power to him largely out of love and respect . " In a democratic family , " commented the French observer , " the father exercises no other power than that which is granted to the affection and the experience of age . . . . Though he be not hedged in with ceremonial respect , his sons at least accost him with confidence . . . the master and constituted ruler have vanished ; the father remains.715 This relationship between father and children has continued from the days of frontier democracy to the present and has , if anything , become even more equalitarian in recent years . The child thus expects kindness , consideration , and ( later ) companionship from the father in return for the spontaneous affection which he has for his parent . "
