Even the date mocked General Henri Fernand Dentz , for it was Bastille Day . As he took up the pen his throat must have worked . Last year he signed Paris away to the conquering Nazis . Now , as Vichy 's High Commissioner to the Levant States , he was about to sign Syria away to the conquering British and , even worse , to the conquering Free French . General Dentz , who rather resembles a provincial druggist in uniform , sighed and signed his full name . <P> Two days before , the Pact that ended the five-week Syrian War had been merely initialed by Vichy 's Brigadier General Joseph Antoine Sylvain Roul de Verdillac , who went to Acre in Palestine for the armistice talks* held in the officers ' mess of the Sidney Smith Barracks . When diminutive General de Verdillac uncapped his pen for the initialing , all the lights in the room suddenly fused out . So the war that started in the early morning moonlight of June 8 ended in the light of a dispatch rider 's motorbike head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Verdillac went to Acre instead of General Dentz , because he is more pro-British , less anti-De Gaulle than his superior . With Lieut . General Sir Henry Maitland ( " Jumbo " ) Wilson at the H-shaped conference table was General Georges Catroux , Free French commander of the campaign , condemned to death by Vichy . The sight of him might have caused General Dentz pain . General de Verdillac , however , lost no time in putting things on a cozy footing . He leaned toward an Australian sentry , winked , made a throat-slitting gesture with one hand and whispered : " Les Baches ! " <P> Despite the generosity of the original British terms , the neck-in-noose Government at Vichy bleated of dishonor , made a brief show of refusing them , then dumped the whole mess into General Dentz 's lap . After thanking the Vichy forces who took part in the campaign , Marshal Henri Philippe Petain declared to Syria 's civilians : " France is going to suffer an eclipse in the Levant as sad for her as for you . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been the fate of all British Middle East defense had not Syria been taken . Beginning with the Iraq revolt last spring when they used Syrian bases to fly aid to Rashid Ali El-Gailani , the Germans had increasingly filtered into the country . If the Axis had got control of Syria the British Middle East Command might as well have folded its tents and gone home . <P> That Syria was a rather jumboesque campaign was hardly General Jumbo Wilson 's fault . He had to tread warily lest he inflame Arab sensibilities or drive Vichy further into the arms of the Axis . The Allies ' hope that large-scale deserticras and native uprisings would quickly crack General Dentz 's defense did not materialize . They had not reckoned that his seasoned regulars would fight no matter who gave the orders . On the British and Free French they had inflicted nearly 1,500 casualties . <P> <P> *The first between Great Britain and France since Napoleon 's day .
