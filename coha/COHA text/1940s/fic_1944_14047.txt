SCENE : The subterranean laundry of the Hotel Mon Repos et de la Rose . It is evening on the 13th of June , 1940 . There has been an air-raid alert and the laundry of MADAME BOUFFIER 'S fourth-class establishment is doing service as an air-raid shelter . AT RISE : MADAME BOUFFIER 'S guests have been aroused from their beds by the alert and are trying to find comfort among the functional oddments of the laundry : the pressing and drying machines , the washtubs , etc . Two of the big tin washtubs have been put together and on them is sleeping a stertorous guest . On a long , narrow table along the wall an exhausted soldier and his pretty young wife are doing the same . On the left on a narrow bench by the wall , completely covered with a gray service blanket , is SZABUNIEWICZ , the Polish orderly of COLONEL STJERBINSKY , fighting off bad dreams . The TRAGIC GENTLEMAN , a faded figure out of Toulouse-Lautrec , all in black with a black cape over his shoulders and wide-brimmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off his despair with an attitude of detachment . From the shaded lamps an unearthly blue light bathes the sleepers in violet . At right a flight of stairs leads up to the sidewalk , and at left another flight leads up into the interior of the hotel . In the distance we hear the buzzing of airplanes . When the curtain goes up , those guests who are not asleep are listening to a radio announcement by the Prime Minister , Paul Reynaud . During this speech the OLD LADY FROM ARRAS comes down the stairs . She is over sixty , pale with fright and sleeplessness , but knits and twitters with a kind of nervous vigor . While the Prime Minister is speaking , she crosses the stage and sits left on her special chair which has a cushion on it . She pounds the cushion into what she conceives to be a comfortable submission and sits down to her knitting and listens to the radio announcement . VOICE OF PRIME MINISTER REYNAUD The situation is serious but not desperate . On the Somme our valiant troops are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bravery . However , the superiority of the enemy in men and material is so great that we must be prepared to expect ( The radio groans off. ) p. 3 YOUNG GIRL ( Who is lying beside her sleeping husband ) Why did the radio go off ? TRAGIC GENTLEMAN They are forbidden to broadcast during an air raid . OLD LADY FROM ARRAS Who was the gentleman on the radio ? TRAGIC GENTLEMAN That was our Prime Minister , Monsieur Paul Reynaud , addressing the nation from Bordeaux . OLD LADY FROM ARRAS ( Very anxious ) But what did he say ? TRAGIC GENTLEMAN He said the situation was serious but not hopeless , or maybe he said it was hopeless but not serious . OLD LADY FROM ARRAS Dear God , dear God , Monsieur Paul Reynaud is very far to the Left . My daughter is a schoolteacher , and she told me . Monsieur Leon Blum would n't have anyone work more than forty hours a week . And this is what it brings us to . The last war was better  --  I understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . Why , my daughter says , why should we die for Danzig ? ( Very militant ) She 's right ! Why should we ? ( MADAME BOUFFIER , the mistress of the establishment , bustles in . She is wonderfully gotten up : she wears a magenta dress with gold-fringe trimmings ; her hair is a marvelously tinted pyramid . She is strident , not unkind , and acts as if her little hotel were Versailles . She carries a lantern , small notebook and pencil . She is followed by SOLLY , of whom she is fond and to whom she is tender . He is a white-faced , hunchbacked Jewish boy of eighteen . He also carries a lantern. ) p. 4 MADAME BOUFFIER Solly dear , you have n't drawn those curtains . We do n't want to have the same trouble with the Chief Warden we had yesterday . SOLLY Yes , Madame Bouffier , at once . ( SOLLY hangs a lantern on the back wall as MADAME BOUFFIER hangs hers on another hook . ) MADAME BOUFFIER And I 'll check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests ) Well , is my little family all here ? OLD LADY FROM ARRAS ( Full of self-pity ) I 'm here , Heaven help me . MADAME BOUFFIER ( Chiding ) You should be used to air raids by this time , Madame Arle . In my hotel the morale is high . I am captain of the ship here , and I want things to be bright and cheerful . That 's our way of defying the Germans . ( In her tour around the room she lifts blanket from SZABUNIEWICZ ' head , takes a peek at him and recovers him . ) OLD LADY FROM ARRAS ( Decidedly not cheerful ) But this is the fourth night I 've sat till dawn in this wretched laundry . MADAME BOUFFIER ( With professional pride ) No hotel in Paris has a more distinguished laundry . You 're lucky to be in it , safe and cozy . ( Continues to check her list. ) p. 5 OLD LADY FROM ARRAS I just ca n't believe what 's happened . You know I 'm from out of town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Mama , this war is nonsense  --  it wo n't last a week . " My daughter 's a schoolteacher  --  and she knows ! MADAME BOUFFIER Some schoolteachers never learn anything they do n't teach . ( Checking her book ) Madame Gravot  --  404 ? YOUNG GIRL Here . MADAME BOUFFIER And Monsieur Gravot  --  404 ? YOUNG GIRL ( Caressing her young husband lightly ) He 's asleep . MADAME BOUFFIER There ! That completes my little family  --  except for 409 and 204. 409 is that Polish Colonel and 204 is Monsieur Jacobowsky . Now where is Monsieur Jacobowsky ? I 've just looked in his room and he 's not there . The Polish Colonel is probably asleep , but where is Monsieur Jacobowsky ? TRAGIC GENTLEMAN Is that important ? MADAME BOUFFIER It is indeed important . It 's important to our morale in here . I prefer optimism to pessimism . I prefer a sunny day to a cloudy day . Monsieur Jacobowsky has a nature like a sunny day . TRAGIC GENTLEMAN ( With mock sadness ) Monsieur Jacobowsky is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your oldest and yet you appear to prefer Monsieur Jacobowsky to me. p. 6 MADAME BOUFFIER When you describe yourself as a paying guest , Monsieur , you employ poetic license . ( In the distance the noise of a bomb . A fussy and nervous little man in a meticulously pressed suit comes into the shelter . He wears a pince-nez and carries a brief case and cane . He comes from the street door . As he comes in the sound of ack-ack guns is heard . Then the sound of planes dies out . ) SZYCKI I must see Colonel Stjerbinsky . MADAME BOUFFIER That 's 409 . He 's probably still in his room . SZYCKI During an air raid ! MADAME BOUFFIER He does n't take air raids seriously . He sleeps through them . SZYCKI It 's vital I see him . MADAME BOUFFIER ( Indicating SZABUNIEWICZ ) There 's another Pole , his orderly , also asleep . Wo n't he do ? ( SZYCKI goes to SZABUNIEWICZ , kneels down beside him , prodding him . ) SZYCKI Szabuniewicz . Wake up ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kneeling , to the floor ) Take cover SZYCKI Szabuniewicz ! ! p. 7 SZABUNIEWICZ Take cover ! SZYCKI You 've been having a bad dream , my friend . This is Szycki . ( SZABUNIEWICZ rises . He is rotund , sly , with innocent round eyes , deeply Machiavellian . ) SZABUNIEWICZ ( Rubs his eyes ) Dream I chased by Messerschmitts . SZYCKI Where is the Colonel ? SZABUNIEWICZ ( Evasive ) He not here ? SZYCKI Obviously he is not here . SZABUNIEWICZ Den he is somewhere else . ( Folding his blanket . ) SZYCKI He is never where you expect to find him . He 's never on time . He is irregular  --  that 's what he is  --  irregular ! SZABUNIEWICZ ( Sits ) Colonel irregular  --  that 's what he is . SZYCKI And I risked my life to bring him some material . SZABUNIEWICZ Give me . I give him . SZYCKI Impossible ! My orders are to put these documents in the Colonel 's hands . SZABUNIEWICZ Colonel 's hands do n't come till Colonel come . p. 8 SZYCKI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essence ! The Germans will be here any minute . ( This statement puts the people in the cellar in a panic . ) OLD LADY FROM ARRAS ( Rises ) My God , what did he say ? The Germans are here ? SOLLY What did he say ? YOUNG GIRL He said they are coming ! The Germans are coming ! MADAME BOUFFIER ( Piously ) May God inspire our generals , Marshal Ptain and General Weygand ! OLD LADY FROM ARRAS ( Her voice rises in hysteria ) The Germans are in Paris . They 're in Paris . Dear God ! Dear God ! MADAME BOUFFIER Quiet , Madame Arle . I 'll have no panic here . Solly , bring in the gramophone from the salon . YOUNG GIRL Wonderful . Let 's have a Chevalier record . TRAGIC GENTLEMAN Chevalier ! He 'll give the Germans their idea of Paris . God , how I hate that gigolo ! MADAME BOUFFIER And , Solly dear , go up to Monsieur Jacobowsky 's room . Maybe he has come back . p. 9 OLD LADY FROM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we stay here ? Why do n't we do something ? ( MONSIEUR JACOBOWSKY comes in through the doorway from the street . He is in his late forties , not tall but somehow not too short  --  a " small medium . " He wears a well-cut lounge suit , which he bought in happier days and which has managed to retain , though it is somewhat shiny , an air of elegance . He has a neat bow tie , a neat voice and everything about him has the crisp edge of tidiness . You feel that in the life he deserted everything in his mnage both business and personal was in good order ; that his extra shoes had a good polish ; his correspondence was caught up ; his desk clear and that when people crossed the threshold of his house to come to dinner they felt a glow of benevolence and the quickened anticipation of a happy evening . His cheerfulness is an emanation from a harried past ; he knows that the worst will probably happen , so that your only chance is to improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do in every small relation of life . He likes people and he wants them , if it is at all possible , to like him . ) S. L. JACOBOWSKY The Germans are not in Paris , Madame , believe me . SOLLY Monsieur Jacobowsky ! MADAME BOUFFIER Oh ! Here he is. p. 10 S. L. JACOBOWSKY I have just been in the Rue Royale and I assure you there is n't a German in sight . In fact , there is n't even a Parisian in sight . I was the only one in sight . MADAME BOUFFIER The Rue Royale ! Monsieur Jacobowsky ! In the middle of an alert . Suppose something had happened  --  a falling building or a bomb . S. L. JACOBOWSKY So there would be one Jacobowsky more or less . The world has endured so much  --  it could endure that too . YOUNG GIRL Monsieur is a very courageous man . S. L. JACOBOWSKY Not at all , Madame . Only  --  at one period of my life I was an accountant  --  and about danger  --  I am statistical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will hit you has yet to be cast . It has been cast , believe me . At Krupp or Skoda . S. L. JACOBOWSKY Oh , I have no doubt . Krupp and Skoda think of me constantly . They cast their little bomb and they think : " This one we 'll send to our nice Jacobowsky . " But even Krupp has to yield to a powerful law  --  the law of probability . Listen : What is the population of Paris ? Four million lives ? Correct ? Now what chance has Krupp , with all his precision work , of hitting one four-millionth of Paris ? Practically non-existent . I tell you I feel sorry for him . So , moving under the immunity of this adorable law  --  I have brought you back some marrons glacs  --  first to our distinguished hostess . ( Offers MADAME BOUFFIER the box. ) p. 11 MADAME BOUFFIER That 's my dear Monsieur Jacobowsky  --  always thinking of others . ( Takes one . ) MAN ON THE WASHTUB ( He is trying to sleep ) All this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  reversing his position , puts his head where his feet were before  --  and tries to sleep again . ) S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Drops his voice and tiptoes around ) Please , Madame , allow me ( To the YOUNG GIRL ) Madame YOUNG GIRL ( In a whisper ) Thank you , Monsieur . OLD LADY FROM ARRAS ( Whispering ) Thank you , Monsieur . S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Offering them to SOLLY ) Solly , friend , you must eat some of these . They 'll warm you up . ( The WASHTUB MAN sticks his hand out , the palm open . JACOBOWSKY pops a marron into his hand . ) YOUNG GIRL Monsieur certainly knows what 's delicious . S. L. JACOBOWSKY People say it 's not good to eat between meals , but I would rather have a snack than a dinner . p. 12 MADAME BOUFFIER ( Looks fondly at JACOBOWSKY ) Why is it that the best husbands are always unmarried ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Offering marrons to the TRAGIC GENTLEMAN ) Monsieur . TRAGIC GENTLEMAN I hate marrons glacs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GENTLEMAN ( Determined to be unhappy ) Especially when they are fresh . MADAME BOUFFIER ( With sudden decision ) Monsieur Jacobowsky , you ought to get married . S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Edging away ) I think maybe not , Madame Bouffier . MADAME BOUFFIER ( Advances ) Why not ? Give me one good reason why not ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Retreats ) You see , Madame Bouffier , I myself am a worshipper of beauty but in my own person I am not quite dazzling . The indifference of the ladies has given me leisure for reading and philosophy . I am a quite well-read man , Madame Bouffier . MADAME BOUFFIER You wo n't know what life is till you get married . p. 13 S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Delicately ) Perhaps there are other ways of finding out . ( He goes over to the OLD LADY . ) OLD LADY FROM ARRAS Sweets are such a consolation in a situation like this . S. L. JACOBOWSKY Quite right , Madame  --  quite right . OLD LADY FROM ARRAS ( Waves her banner ) My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside her on stool ) A noble profession . Aristotle was a schoolteacher . OLD LADY FROM ARRAS In Arras I left everything behind , even my daughter  --  and fled  --  fled in France itself ! Who could ever imagine a thing like that ? While I was doing it , I did n't believe I was doing it and even now , right this minute , I do n't believe it . S. L. JACOBOWSKY Oh , you 'll get used to flight . I did . I 've spent all my life in a futile effort to become a citizen of some country . You know , I speak seven languages fluently . Wrong , but fluently . In the technique of flight I may say I am a virtuoso . Migration one : Poland to Germany . My poor mother took her five children , her candlesticks , her pillows and fled to Berlin . There I grew up . I was successful in business . I was a citizen , a patriot . I belonged . My mistake ! Migration two : Berlin to Vienna ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bars ) But I soon found out that underneath the waltzes there was a counter-melody . Less charming , more ruthless . First thing you know I was embarked on migration three . Prague . Now Prague is a lovely city . Have you ever seen the lovely baroque architecture in Prague ? p. 14 TRAGIC GENTLEMAN I hate baroque ! S. L. JACOBOWSKY I understand that , too . A lot of people very qualified do n't like baroque . Still I hated to leave Prague . This time without an overcoat . It was a new experience . Very interesting . Migration four : Paris ! City of Light . Here I breathed the air of freedom . I understood exactly how Heine felt when he got here . I said to myself : " You are Heine  --  without the genius . " But now I have the feeling that there is ahead of me still another migration . Well , I 'm ready . You see , one gets used to it . OLD LADY FROM ARRAS ( Rises , fluffing her chair pillow ) But after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparison . My family has lived in Arras for five centuries . S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Impressed ) Five centuries ! You do n't mean it ! OLD LADY FROM ARRAS ( Pounding her pillow ) And now the Boches may push us into the sea . My daughter is right . She always says , " France needs a Hitler too ! " S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Rises quietly ) Do n't worry , Madame , your daughter will probably get her wish  --  mustache , forelock and all . MADAME BOUFFIER I wo n't have such talk ! p. 15 OLD LADY FROM ARRAS Did I say something wrong ? MADAME BOUFFIER Your daughter must be insane . OLD LADY FROM ARRAS She 's not insane . She 's a schoolteacher ! MADAME BOUFFIER I wo n't hear such talk . OLD LADY FROM ARRAS Lots of people think so . ( Police whistle off stage . The AIR RAID WARDEN enters explosively from the street . He is in high dudgeon . ) AIR RAID WARDEN Are you out of your mind , Madame Bouffier ? MADAME BOUFFIER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculties . AIR RAID WARDEN It 's always your hotel I have trouble with . It 's your hotel that is putting all Paris in danger . Fourth floor , street side  --  second and third windows from the right . Lit up like a Christmas tree ! MADAME BOUFFIER Fourth floor , street side ? That 's 409 . That 's the Polish Colonel . AIR RAID WARDEN I do n't care if he 's the King of Poland . He 's breaking the regulations and it 's your responsibility ! MADAME BOUFFIER I 've told him ten times . He does n't listen . When I tell him , he laughs . p. 16 AIR RAID WARDEN He laughs , does he ? He laughs ! I 'll teach him . I 'll teach him to laugh . This is Paris , not Warsaw ! MADAME BOUFFIER ( Egging him on ) Why do n't you go up and tell him ? AIR RAID WARDEN I will  --  I 'll more than tell him . I 'll teach him a lesson . I 'll wipe up the floor with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come along , Solly dear . ( She and SOLLY follow the WARDEN upstairs . ) MAN ON THE WASHTUB Oh , my God , why wo n't they let me sleep ? ( He abandons the washtubs , wrapped in his blankets , and goes to a corner where he curls up on the floor . ) SZABUNIEWICZ Poor Warden . I pity for him . SZYCKI It will serve your Colonel right  --  no matter what the Warden does to him . SZABUNIEWICZ I wonder what Colonel do to Warden . Colonel not alone and when he 's not alone he wants strictly to be alone . SZYCKI So that 's what he 's doing ! SZABUNIEWICZ Colonel has always time for romance . SZYCKI At a time like this ! p. 17 SZABUNIEWICZ Any time good for romance . SZYCKI And I have to entrust this mission to a man like that ! I 'll give him a piece of my mind . SZABUNIEWICZ You too  --  good ! Piece of your mind what Colonel needs . Give him big piece . ( During this scene JACOBOWSKY has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken out of his pocket . The TRAGIC GENTLEMAN comes up behind him , curious . ) TRAGIC GENTLEMAN May I ask , sir , what you are reading ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY The Ethics of Spinoza . TRAGIC GENTLEMAN ( Laughs ) Ethics ! What an anachronism ! In the age of the Nazis  --  Ethics ! S. L. JACOBOWSKY I do n't agree . The Nazis are the anachronism  --  not the ethics ! Listen : ( He reads from the book ) " For the wise man , insofar as he is wise , is scarcely ever disturbed in spirit : he is conscious of himself , of God and things as a certain eternal necessity ; he never ceases to be and always enjoys satisfaction of mind . " TRAGIC GENTLEMAN " Satisfaction of mind ! " Now ! In this moment  --  when the locusts cover the earth ! p. 18 S. L. JACOBOWSKY This was not written for special emergencies , sir . It is for all eternity . TRAGIC GENTLEMAN And will this help you when the Germans catch you ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The top spins but the center is at rest . ( At this moment the WARDEN comes back , crestfallen . ) SZABUNIEWICZ ( Gloating ) Well , did you wipe up the floor with him ? AIR RAID WARDEN ( Evidently bewildered by his contact with the COLONEL ) That Colonel 's crazy . No use talking to a crazy man ! What kind of a type is that ? He 's peculiar . I could n't reach an understanding with him . What 's the matter with him ? He 's dangerous . ( He stalks out through the street door . ) ( MADAME BOUFFIER comes in , talking to the COLONEL who is behind-her . ) MADAME BOUFFIER And I tell you , Colonel , even if you did fight for France your behavior is unpardonable . ( She comes down the little steps . A moment later the COLONEL appears . He is magnificent in his uniform , tall , commanding , saturnine , electric with vitality , euphoric with a sense of his own immemorial authority in the scheme of things . His forehead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps into the laundry. ) p. 19 COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Addressing his orderly ) Szabuniewicz , prepare our departure from Paris . SZABUNIEWICZ Yes , Colonel . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Whispers a boudoir confidence ) And , oh , Szabuniewicz , I part from this lovely creature who follows me . Disengage me from her  --  but  --  very gracious ( COSETTE , a pretty French woman of about thirty , comes in . She is a quite sensible person and generally unsentimental  --  except for the COLONEL ! ) COSETTE Tadeusz , my darling , if you leave Paris , I go too . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Turns to her , rolling smoothly through the routines of gallantry ) This I tell you . The madrigal of our farewell they have interrupt , but a rose for you will grow always in my heart . Our roads part  --  perhaps forever  --  but the memory of your sweet face MADAME BOUFFIER ( Cutting in ) It 's all very well for you to be romantic but on account of you the police will padlock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . They will not . They will lack the time . Tomorrow the police of Paris will be running errands for the Huns ! p. 20 MADAME BOUFFIER ( Startled ) Do you mean , Colonel , that the Germans will meet with no further resistance ? COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY This I know . The regiment I command is force of three thousand men . On the Somme we defend a bridge and for every gun is only eight cartridges . TRAGIC GENTLEMAN Where was the French Army ? MADAME BOUFFIER ( Echoes ) What happened to our Army ? COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY The German Stukas make black the sky and not one French plane to help us . That I know . On my right and on my left I see the French divisions  --  fine soldiers  --  want to fight  --  have nothing with which to fight  --  so they are obliged to run  --  and of my own three thousand Polish boys only is left fifteen . I am their father , and I lose my children  --  three thousand of them . This I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . ( Slaps his heart ) Rather I would be with them , with my children that are gone . S. L. JACOBOWSKY Then , Colonel , it is your considered opinion that France is lost ! COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY No . She is not lost , Monsieur . She is gift to the German . Charming gift to the German . ( SZABUNIEWICZ has poured a drink from a pocket flask , which he gives to the COLONEL . The COLONEL drinks it. ) p. 21 TRAGIC GENTLEMAN ( Valedictory ) Paris , farewell ! ( At the vision of this disaster the OLD LADY sways . ) OLD LADY FROM ARRAS ( About to faint ) I do n't feel very well . I do n't feel S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Goes to her , grips her arm to sustain her ) Courage , Madame . My poor mother , wise woman that she was , always used to say that no matter what happens in life there are always two possibilities . It is true . For example , right now it is a dark moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germans  --  either they 'll come to Paris or they 'll jump to England . If they do n't come to Paris , that 's good . But if they should come to Paris , again there are two possibilities . Either we succeed in escaping , or we do n't succeed . If we succeed , that 's good , but if we do n't there are always two possibilities . The Germans , either they 'll put us in a good concentration camp or in a bad concentration camp . If in a good concentration camp that 's good , but if they put us in a bad concentration camp , there are still two TRAGIC GENTLEMAN ( Catching him up ) Two fine possibilities . Jump in the river or be shot by the Boches . Paris , farewell ! ( In spite of JACOBOWSKY 'S optimism , the OLD LADY FROM ARRAS promptly faints . Some of the guests form a closely packed knot around her , trying to revive her . COSETTE , in her personal coil , pleads with the COLONEL. ) p. 22 COSETTE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any possibility for us ? COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY My lovely friend , this is what I am about to tell you when they interrupt  --  since last I saw you I have fallen in love COSETTE I knew it  --  the moment I saw you  --  I knew there was something . I knew it . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY And for you my feeling is so tender , so precious , that I can not give you less than myself for you deserve all . COSETTE ( Fatalistic ) I knew it . ( SZABUNIEWICZ sidles up to the COLONEL . ) SZABUNIEWICZ Please , Colonel . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Shouts ) What , Szabuniewicz ? SZABUNIEWICZ ( Indicates SZYCKI ; he enjoys the prospect of battle ) This gentleman here waiting for you . He angry . He says you are irregular . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Lofty ) What interest that to me ? SZABUNIEWICZ Has very strong mind . Wants to give you piece . p. 23 COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY I hope he has for me something less mediocre . SZYCKI I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Holds out imperious hand ) Then give . SZYCKI ( Hands him yellow oblong envelope ) Here it is . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Everything here ? SZYCKI Everything in code . Addresses of our men in Warsaw , Lodz and Cracow . Every plan and communication is there . You must get it to our government in London . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY I bring it to London . SZYCKI In the Caf of Papa Clairon in St. Jean de Luz you meet the man with the gray gloves . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Nods ) Gray gloves . SZYCKI He will give you passage on corvette with other of our people to London . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY I meet him when ? SZYCKI On the 18th in the afternoon . p. 24 COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Refuses to clutter his mind with tedious detail ) Szabuniewicz , how many days away is the 18th ? SZABUNIEWICZ ( Promptly ) Six days . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY I deliver the papers . SZYCKI I must impress upon you , sir , time is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon you , my desk bureaucrat , that you speak to one of Pilsudski 's Colonels . I deliver these papers my own method , my own way , my own time . SZYCKI The corvette wo n't wait for you . If you 're not there on the afternoon of the 18th it sails without you . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Then let him sail . If necessary , I swim to London . SZYCKI I have obeyed my orders . The papers are in your hands . ( He starts to go . ) COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Shouts after him ) You go back to your bureau , give orders to your office boy , not to Tadeusz Boleslav Stjerbinsky . Szabuniewicz , we leave Paris now . p. 25 SZABUNIEWICZ How ? COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY I take plane . SZABUNIEWICZ The last plane leaved yesterday night . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Then I go by car . SZABUNIEWICZ Vice-consul go off yesterday night . He take all four cars . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Why that pig need four cars ? SZABUNIEWICZ I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get me horse . SZABUNIEWICZ Horse ! COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Why not ? In one day good horse cover so many kilometers as one medium tank . Pack my trunk , everything you see . ( As SZABUNIEWICZ turns to obey ) Wait ! Szabuniewicz , child  --  my rosary ! Do n't forget my rosary ! ( SZABUNIEWICZ goes upstairs . ) MADAME BOUFFIER ( Calls after him ) And do n't forget not to put the light on ! COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Not to worry , Madame . My man find everything in the dark . ( The COLONEL finds himself unexpectedly confronted by JACOBOWSKY . He stares at him. ) p. 26 S. L. JACOBOWSKY Colonel , my name is Jacobowsky  --  S. L. Jacobowsky  --  in a certain sense a countryman . I , too , was born in Poland . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Turns away after a sharp glance ) About that  --  there is nothing I can do . S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( As if he had been encouraged ) Inadvertently I heard you discuss with my other countryman means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is important for you to leave Paris ? COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Spinning around ) Monsieur , what your name was ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY Jacobowsky , by your leave . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY You eavesdrop on our conversation . S. L. JACOBOWSKY Eavesdrop ? Why do I have to eavesdrop when I hear without eavesdropping ? Now my suggestion is that possibly  --  we can get a car in which to leave Paris . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY We ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY The good Madame Bouffier here , she has spoken to me of a car for sale p. 27 COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY This no doubt very convenient for you but how does it concern me ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY If the car were available we might take it together . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY You persist in the use of this intimate pronoun " we . " When I travel , I travel alone . When I travel with company it is company that I choose . S. L. JACOBOWSKY An admirable way to travel . And from my side , I would choose you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a chivalrous man . Now I have to provide you with a reason why you should choose me . If you will forgive me for saying so , I am a resourceful man . Strength plus resourcefulness ! Is n't it a good combination for an emergency like this ? Tell me frankly , sir , your opinion . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY I do not understand your mentality . ( He turns to COSETTE , takes her in his arms ) When the alarm stop , my man will take you home . COSETTE But I do n't want to go home . I want to stay with you . I want to stay with you forever . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY My sweet child  --  this is not possible . COSETTE ( Bursts out ) Who is she  --  that you love ? p. 28 COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY And what will it avail you to know ? How can I convey to you the tenderness I feel for you , the fragrance your image invokes in me ( With an impulsive gesture he removes a decoration from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know what this is , my child ? It is the Grand Cross of the Order of St. George . It is yours ! COSETTE I do n't want your medal . I want you . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY This is the best of me . When I received it , I wept . It is yours . ( SZABUNIEWICZ returns . ) SZABUNIEWICZ Everything prepared to go , Colonel . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Szabuniewicz , you take my sweet friend here home safe ( SZABUNIEWICZ comes forward eagerly , a gleam in his eye . ) SZABUNIEWICZ Yes , Colonel . COSETTE I 'd rather go alone , thank you . ( Her eyes meet the COLONEL 'S . She sees it is hopeless ) I wo n't forget you  --  not in a thousand years . ( She starts upstairs ) Good-bye . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Farewell , Cosette . ( As she exits  --  in an ecstasy of romantic dramatization ) In the cathedral of my soul a candle burns for you , a flame that will never go out . ( COSETTE is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his own gift for romantic rhetoric . SZABUNIEWICZ clucks back admiringly . JACOBOWSKY , now that the coast is clear , approaches the COLONEL again. ) p. 29 S. L. JACOBOWSKY Forgive me , sir , but may we resume our conversation ? COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Oh ! You are Monsieur Wolfsohn  --  no ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY Yes , Jacobowsky  --  if you do n't mind . My mother always used to say , no matter how hopeless things look , there are always two possibilities . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Flatly ) I disagree with your mother . S. L. JACOBOWSKY I can prove it mathematically . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Why you speak to me mathematically ? Hear me , Monsieur Wolfsohn , for a true man is one possibility . S. L. JACOBOWSKY That 's not enough . With one possibility I ca n't maneuver . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY I repeat , Monsieur Wolfsohn , for a man of honor one possibility . S. L. JACOBOWSKY If that were true , I would be dead , I do n't know how many times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument  --  that we acquire this car COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Again you assume that we are engaged in a joint enterprise , and this is an exaggeration . I do not know you , Monsieur p. 30 S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( His voice rises a little desperately ) I must tell you , sir , that this may be the last chance to get a car in Paris . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Then I go on horseback . S. L. JACOBOWSKY You will never be in St. Jean de Luz on the 18th if you travel on horseback . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Psiav Krev  --  you eavesdrop this too ! ( In a kind of despair ) Szabuniewicz , disengage me from this fellow . ( SZABUNIEWICZ rushes to JACOBOWSKY and urges him away from the COLONEL . At this moment the sirens howl . The alert is over . SOLLY and the YOUNG GIRL support the OLD LADY FROM ARRAS , helping her out . This outgoing torrent carries along with it JACOBOWSKY , who , as he is swept away , cries out exhortations to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SZABUNIEWICZ are left alone . ) COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( To SZABUNIEWICZ ) Szabuniewicz , my sword ! The affrontery of this fellow . Every rebuff he takes for an invitation . SZABUNIEWICZ ( Buckling on the COLONEL 'S sword  --  the opportunist ) Still , if he should get a comfortable car p. 31 COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Out of the question . You know I travel alone . SZABUNIEWICZ ( Temporizing  --  it would solve his problem if JACOBOWSKY got a car and the COLONEL would take it ) Yes , I know  --  I know . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Well  --  what are you waiting for ? SZABUNIEWICZ I am formulating my plans . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Marianne awaits me at St. Cyrille . SZABUNIEWICZ ( Aghast ) St. Cyrille ! COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY St. Cyrille . SZABUNIEWICZ But that is north ! COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Of course it 's north . Did you think that I thought it was east , or west or south ? SZABUNIEWICZ But that is where the Germans are ! COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Since when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stops me  --  no German  --  no Germans . ( Exalted by his own romantic Quixoticism he starts for the stairs , shouting aloud his affirmation ) Marianne  --  I come  --  to you ! ( He is gone. ) p. 32 SZABUNIEWICZ ( In a panic runs after him , importuning wildly ) But , Colonel ! St. Cyrille ! Colonel , I beg you St. Cyrille ! Colonel ! Curtain p. 33 Act 1 , Scene 2 ACT ONESCENE II SCENE : The little square outside the Hotel Mon Repos et de la Rose . It is very early in the morning ; a vista of old Paris buildings , in the distance a church , all gleaming in the pearly iridescence of dawn . A crested and polished Renault limousine stands before the entrance to MADAME BOUFFIER 'S hotel . When the curtain goes up a CHAUFFEUR in a violet uniform is expatiating to JACOBOWSKY on the miracles of this car . The chauffeur 's uniform is impeccable . His face , however , is a study in stupidity and cunning . CHAUFFEUR ( With corrupt candor ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts . Facts are facts , as they say . Now where are the Germans ? At Meaux ! Which way are they marching ? This way ! Tomorrow they 'll be marching up the Champs Elyses . What an optimist I am ! This evening ! S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( His patience nearly gone ) Come to the point , please . CHAUFFEUR The Germans will enter Paris from west-northwest . Whereas , here before you stands one of the most faithful autos in France , ready to drive you west-southwest . S. L. JACOBOWSKY Come to the point , if you please . p. 34 CHAUFFEUR The point is you should thank your lucky stars that I came along like this . There 's not another car left in Paris ! Even the few taxis that are left are hiding away since yesterday . Try to get a cab , Monsieur . ( JACOBOWSKY starts to go . The CHAUFFEUR pulls him back ) Just try and see what happens . And suppose you found another car  --  where would you get the gasoline ? Where would that blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Abruptly ) Are you sick ? Monsieur , you know , you look sick . S. L. JACOBOWSKY Who looks well so early in the morning ? Well , it 's possible I 'm nervous today . CHAUFFEUR Keep up your morale ! Swat your wife twice a day  --  that always helps morale . S. L. JACOBOWSKY About this car CHAUFFEUR This car comes from a very distinguished stable . Guess which one . S. L. JACOBOWSKY No guessing games , please . No guessing games . CHAUFFEUR ( Playing his trump card ) Rothschild ! S. L. JACOBOWSKY The Baron Rothschild ? ( He whistles . ) CHAUFFEUR Do n't you recognize this crest ? Monsieur , in this car you will travel like a king . p. 35 S. L. JACOBOWSKY I do n't want to be so conspicuous . CHAUFFEUR Just before he left , the Baron shook hands with me . He said , " Philbert , it is true that I am particularly attached to this car . " S. L. JACOBOWSKY Come to the point . What do you want ? I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife and children are as familiar to me as my own face . I know what you like to eat and drink , what paper you read ! But what do you want for this car ? CHAUFFEUR ( Not to be rushed ) The rubber satisfies you , I take it ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY It 's rubber . CHAUFFEUR The tank is filled to the brim with gasoline , I mentioned that ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY You did . CHAUFFEUR And the Mobiloil ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY You mentioned that too . CHAUFFEUR And that there are three more cans in the back , free of charge ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY You 've told me three times . CHAUFFEUR And you realize by now , Monsieur , you 're the luckiest man in Paris ? p. 36 S. L. JACOBOWSKY Stop envying me and tell me the price . CHAUFFEUR And on my side , I feel almost certain the Baron would be happy to have you as his successor . All in all , adding all these facts together  --  there is really nothing more to say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll say it . Well ? CHAUFFEUR Monsieur , this superb vehicle will cost you a mere fleabite  --  forty thousand francs . S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Sways ) Do n't lift me till I fall CHAUFFEUR Morale , Monsieur . Keep it up ! ( But JACOBOWSKY washes his hands of the negotiations . He starts away . ) S. L. JACOBOWSKY Thank you very much for your trouble . Good-bye . CHAUFFEUR ( Follows him in a panic ) Monsieur , I await your counter proposals . Did I say forty ? I really meant thirty . S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Temporizes ) I want to buy this car . You want to sell it . Fact ? CHAUFFEUR Fact . S. L. JACOBOWSKY You told me the Germans will be here any minute . They will requisition this car . Fact ? Fact ! You have to sell it or dump it in the river . Fact ? Fact ! Does it have a spare tire ? No ! And look at the tires on the wheels . ( Kicking one ) That has seen a good thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Riding over him ) And under the hood  --  ( Lifts up hood of car ) My God , what is going on in there ! Black and greasy ! A regular Dante 's Inferno in there ! ( He closes the hood . ) CHAUFFEUR ( Hurt ) Excuse me , that motor works like my own heart ! S. L. JACOBOWSKY And how do I know you have n't got a heart condition ? All in all , this venerable monument is n't worth ten thousand francs ! CHAUFFEUR ( Aghast ) Monsieur ! S. L. JACOBOWSKY Attention , Monsieur ! Are you legally authorized to sell this car ? I smell here a most irregular transaction  --  final price fifteen thousand ! ( He counts out money . ) CHAUFFEUR Monsieur . For the sake of my children S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Adds an extra banknote ) For the sake of your children , sixteen thousand . CHAUFFEUR You are over-reaching an old soldier of Verdun p. 38 S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Adds additional banknote ) For the sake of Verdun , seventeen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Accepting the bills ) Now you see how weak we Frenchmen are . The Nazis are right  --  that 's our damned decadence for you ! The ownership license ( Gives him license ) As soon as you sign your name the Baron 's limousine is yours . ( Handing him key ) Here is the ignition key . S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Taking it ) Ignition key ? What do you do with the ignition key ? CHAUFFEUR ( Surprised ) Monsieur , in the lock , you ( JACOBOWSKY tries to fit the ignition key in the keyhole of the door of the car ) You do n't know what you do with the ignition key ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY It now occurs to me that I do n't know how to drive . At home I always had a driver . CHAUFFEUR ( Edging away ) You 'll find someone . S. L. JACOBOWSKY What are you doing today ? I mean , would your wife permit you to leave Paris for a few days ? p. 39 CHAUFFEUR Out of the question , Monsieur . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. L. JACOBOWSKY Rothschild 's too ? CHAUFFEUR ( Pointing to the TRAGIC GENTLEMAN , who has just come out of the hotel ) Maybe he 'll drive your car . ( Under his broad , capelike coat the TRAGIC GENTLEMAN carries a modest piece of luggage . He takes a few deep breaths as if to fill his lungs with Paris air for the last time . ) S. L. JACOBOWSKY Good morning , sir . Can you drive a car ? TRAGIC GENTLEMAN How does that concern you ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY It seems to me you fill your lungs with the air of Paris as if for the last time . TRAGIC GENTLEMAN ( Sadly ) Yes , I am leaving Paris . S. L. JACOBOWSKY Any conveyance ? TRAGIC GENTLEMAN My legs . S. L. JACOBOWSKY Would you care to come with me ? I have just bought a car . Now if you can drive , you could reach your destination much faster . ( MADAME BOUFFIER comes in , stands on stoop , watching the scene. ) p. 40 TRAGIC GENTLEMAN Destination is a sixth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it . I have no destination . S. L. JACOBOWSKY Would n't you rather ride to it ? TRAGIC GENTLEMAN No . I shall continue on foot like everyone else . There , you hear them ( In the distance the confused tramping of footsteps is now heard . ) S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Pale ) The Germans ? TRAGIC GENTLEMAN No , the Parisians . CHAUFFEUR ( Lounging about out of curiosity ; he has no cars to sell . He is simply lazy ) Yes , that 's the Parisians all right . TRAGIC GENTLEMAN Walking , walking , walking . They are marching to the stations but the stations are dead  --  no trains move out  --  so they turn about and walk through the long rows of suburbs  --  a thousand , ten thousand , one hundred thousand  --  all with bag and baggage . What is kept of life animates the legs and they walk and walk . Where we shall be when the Boches arrive only God and St. Denis know ! Listen ! ( The sound of the rolling of shutters ) The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lafayette and Potin and the smart little jewel boxes in the Rue de la Paix . When the Boches march in , Paris will be a dirty coffin , a coffin without a corpse . But I was born in Paris and to Paris I belong and I 'm moving with the people of Paris out of Paris and I want to walk not drive  --  walk with all the others  --  with the moving boulevards , day after day  --  hour after hour . When your legs ache , the heart does n't ache so much . ( He goes out . JACOBOWSKY gazes after him , spellbound . In his trance he muses aloud. ) p. 41 S. L. JACOBOWSKY He knows his destination  --  to be at one with the other Parisians ; and my destination  --  like the Greeks of Xenophon  --  Thalata ! ( MADAME BOUFFIER walks over to him . She is concerned and mystified . JACOBOWSKY explains to her ) Thalata ! That 's what the ancient Greeks called the sea . Because on the sea there are ships and these ships sail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in desperation and appeals to the CHAUFFEUR again ) Wo n't you drive me to the sea ? CHAUFFEUR ( Gaily ) Impossible , Monsieur , my mother is dying . ( In the background an OLD MAN and a LITTLE BOY walk by . The OLD MAN carries his belongings in a few bags and hums a street song . Other stragglers pass by . ) MADAME BOUFFIER ( As she looks at them ) At last it 's happening . Everyone is deserting me . Everyone is leaving Paris  --  and now you , too , my dear Monsieur Jacobowsky . My house is empty  --  only the mice and the water bugs and those two Poles are left . I have no courage any more . Just imagine , Monsieur Jacobowsky , at thirty-five I am a broken , old woman . ( Skeptical guffaw from the CHAUFFEUR . MADAME BOUFFIER is furious ) What are you laughing at , you scamp ? Thirtyfive in May . Do you want to see my birth certificate ? p. 42 S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Consoling her ) You have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy the car from this robber ? ( MADAME BOUFFIER and CHAUFFEUR snarl at each other . ) S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Leading her out of controversy ) Thank you for bringing him to me . Here is a warehouse list  --  old furniture I bought before the war  --  I had a dream of furnishing my own apartment . Take it . There are some nice things . Decorate your house with them . MADAME BOUFFIER ( Accepting warehouse list ) I 'll keep it for you . One day you 'll find a beautiful woman who will love you and I 'll give her your furniture . S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Dismissing the possibility ) A beautiful woman does n't need my furniture . Where are my things ? MADAME BOUFFIER ( Calling ) Solly dear , Monsieur Jacobowsky 's things ! S. L. JACOBOWSKY It seems foolish , but I 'm very much attached to those two Teheran rugs . They 're museum pieces . At least I 'll take with me the illusion of a charming home . ( SOLLY enters staggering under the rugs. ) p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you south to the sea ? CHAUFFEUR What would I do at the sea ! I 'm a Parisian ! S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( To SOLLY ) Solly dear , I am worried about you . What will become of you if the Germans come ? SOLLY ( Depositing his load in the car ) I 'd rather not think about it . MADAME BOUFFIER ( With emotion ) I make myself responsible for him  --  if I have to lock him in the cellar and stand guard . ( The COLONEL 'S voice is heard off stage berating SZABUNIEWICZ . ) COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Szabuniewicz , I have told you over and over again , you must provide transportation . Where is it ? ( SZABUNIEWICZ and COLONEL STJERBINSKY now come out of the hotel . SZABUNIEWICZ is carrying a bulging officer 's knapsack and saddle bags . Under one arm the COLONEL has a violin case . ) SZABUNIEWICZ This question I fail to solve , Colonel . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Did you think we would remain in Paris forever ? You should have thought about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes . ( Drops baggage on the floor . ) COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY I told you a car , a horse , a carriage  --  anything . Where are they ? SZABUNIEWICZ Give me time , Colonel . I will solve it . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Time ! There is no time ! Time is of the ( Automatically he finds himself repeating the hated phrase . He stops and at the same moment he takes in the Rothschild limousine . ) ( JACOBOWSKY points dramatically to the car . ) S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Quietly ) There she stands , Colonel . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY What is to me  --  that she stands ? Let her stand . ( To SZABUNIEWICZ ) You say no car is left in Paris  --  here is car . SZABUNIEWICZ ( Who is dying for the deal to go through  --  this will solve all his problems ) Maybe I can negotiate S. L. JACOBOWSKY Why negotiate ? You are welcome to it . ( To COLONEL ) You remember , perhaps , our conversation ? p. 45 COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you by any chance an automobilist ? COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Elegantly ) I am cavalryist . S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Pleasantly ) But modern cavalry is generally motorized . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( With simple pride ) In Poland  --  no ! S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Noticing violin case ) You are a violinist ? COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY I fiddle . S. L. JACOBOWSKY You are fond of chamber music ? COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Isolated ) I fiddle solo . S. L. JACOBOWSKY Can you drive a car  --  solo ? COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY If road is correct and straight I can drive . Curves I do n't care to see . S. L. JACOBOWSKY Perhaps on the curves , we can compromise . p. 46 COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( With sudden recognition ) I remember you now  --  you are Monsieur Leibowicz . S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Pleased with his accuracy ) Yes , Jacobowsky . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY You are Pole ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY I was born in Poland . It is the first of my native lands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were you born ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY In the village of Studno near Kasimisz . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( The recognition becomes almost intimate ) So  --  Studno near Stanislau . SZABUNIEWICZ ( Helping along ) Good locality ! COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY My father had great estates there . Owned many villages . Your papa , a dealer in liquid spirits , no doubt ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY Not spirits  --  spirit !  --  and not liquid . He taught the children Biblical history . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Good profession . p. 47 SZABUNIEWICZ ( All for the intellect ) Very educational . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Mumbles an inventory to reassure himself ) From the village of Studno near Kasimisz  --  father schoolteacher  --  understands music S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Feeling the moment has come for the coup de grace ) Perhaps it might be interesting , sir , for us to travel together . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Interesting ? How interesting ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY Psychologically . You are  --  if I may make so bold  --  cast suddenly in a new role . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , you are persecuted yourself . Now I 'm used to that and I 'll help you get used to it too . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( A bit put off ) I need no help from you , Monsieur . S. L. JACOBOWSKY Probably not  --  but if you should want it , there I 'll be . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY If I consent drive your car , it is because it help me bring out from danger vital documents of our Polish motherland 's fight for freedom . p. 48 S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Humoring him ) Do not deny me the privilege of assisting in a patriotic act . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Struck by this ) Ah ! You would be patriot ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Firm ) My deepest ambition . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( With a spasm of tolerance ) Can not deny man right to be patriot . SZABUNIEWICZ ( Godly ) That would be sin . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( He has made the great decision . He turns to JACOBOWSKY ) Monsieur , I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel ! If it were n't for your rank , I 'd embrace you . ( The COLONEL stops any overtures with an upraised hand . Then he turns to inspect the car , sees JACOBOWSKY 'S rugs in the back seat . ) COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY First , come out from this car these rugs . ( He puts his violin in the back seat of the car. ) p. 49 S. L. JACOBOWSKY Excuse me , Colonel , these rugs mean very much to me . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Excuse me , please . I am one of Pilsudski 's Colonels ! I not used to voyage in furniture truck . No , the backside must remain empty . S. L. JACOBOWSKY And why must the backside remain empty ? COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY I am not used to give reasons . SZABUNIEWICZ ( Explaining ) We travel light . MADAME BOUFFIER ( Intervenes ) But it 's his car COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Monsieur ( To SZABUNIEWICZ ) What 's his name ? MADAME BOUFFIER ( Shouting it ) Jacobowsky ! COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Monsieur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your small self but you serve high purpose  --  maybe for first time in your life  --  no ? SZABUNIEWICZ You help Poland . S. L. JACOBOWSKY Ca n't I help Poland and take my rugs too ? p. 50 SZABUNIEWICZ ( Whispers ) Be careful  --  you 'll irritate him . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( He is irritated ) You see , Szabuniewicz , what means to take favor from certain people . ( He walks away , whispering imprecations to himself . ) SZABUNIEWICZ You did irritate him ! S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( After a mournful pause ) Solly dear , take the rugs out of the car . ( As SOLLY obeys ) Madame Bouffier , please keep these rugs as a further acknowledgment of my debt to you . ( SZABUNIEWICZ keeps piling the COLONEL 'S paraphernalia into the car . ) MADAME BOUFFIER ( Outraged  --  to JACOBOWSKY ) My dear , why do you stand for it ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY There are two things a man should n't be angry at  --  what he can help and what he ca n't help . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a violent controversy with himself . ) MADAME BOUFFIER Look ! He 's talking to himself . The moment he stamped into my house I knew he was out of his mind . p. 51 S. L. JACOBOWSKY You 're wrong , Madame Bouffier . A man who talks to himself is usually lonely . I have the most charming conversations with myself . SZABUNIEWICZ ( Everything having been cleared , he opens the front door of the car ) Take place , gentlemen  --  Boches is on the march . ( COLONEL gets in the front seat , sits there stiffly . JACOBOWSKY comes forward with an automobile map . ) S. L. JACOBOWSKY Our route is main boulevard , Place de la Bastille , Ivry , and down the Route Nationale west-southwest . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY You are wrong , Yalofsky  --  our way go down the Champs Elyses , Neuilly , Saint-Cloud and Route Nationale west-northwest . S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( To SZABUNIEWICZ , easily ) I am sure the Colonel means west-southwest . SZABUNIEWICZ ( With a malicious grin ) No . Colonel means west-northwest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S set face ) Northwest ! ( Turns to SZABUNIEWICZ ) Is there something wrong with my hearing ? p. 52 SZABUNIEWICZ Be careful  --  you 'll irritate him . S. L. JACOBOWSKY Did he say northwest ? SZABUNIEWICZ That 's what he said . And that 's where we go . S. L. JACOBOWSKY But northwest  --  there are the German divisions  --  ( To MADAME BOUFFIER ) right into the arms of SZABUNIEWICZ ( Warning him ) Leave it to him . ( A silence . JACOBOWSKY struggles with this appalling fact . He advances toward the car and addresses the statue of the COLONEL . ) S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Tentatively ) Colonel dear  --  I do n't ask for a shoe larger than my foot but , after all , it is my car , is n't it ? ( Suddenly uncertain , he turns to the CHAUFFEUR ) Did I buy this car from you or did n't I ? CHAUFFEUR You bought it all right . SZABUNIEWICZ ( Increased warning ) Be careful ! S. L. JACOBOWSKY But it is my car . MADAME BOUFFIER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 53 S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Points to CHAUFFEUR ) There is the evidence . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Rises in mighty anger ) My car ! What means that ? On a stormy sea you say , " This lifeboat is my lifeboat ? " The devil take you  --  to hell you go . ( He stamps out of the car and flings a command to SZABUNIEWICZ ) Szabuniewicz ! Horses ! ( He goes off . ) ( The lifeline is cut ! The others stand frozen in silence . SZABUNIEWICZ is the first to emerge . ) SZABUNIEWICZ I told you to be careful  --  when he says northwest , he means northwest . S. L. JACOBOWSKY Evidently . SZABUNIEWICZ We go first to pick up lady . S. L. JACOBOWSKY Lady ? What kind of lady ? SZABUNIEWICZ ( Looking foxy ) Lady-love . MADAME BOUFFIER ( To JACOBOWSKY ) My dear , ca n't you find another driver ? ( The COLONEL comes back . Locked in his indignation he stands apart , his arms crossed over his chest . He waits for the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 54 S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( To MADAME BOUFFIER ) Just a minute ( Clears his throat , whispers to SZABUNIEWICZ ) Any lady who would interest the Colonel to such an extent where he risks his life and documents  --  well  --  she must be a very rare person . SZABUNIEWICZ Of course ! ( A silence . JACOBOWSKY approaches the COLONEL . ) S. L. JACOBOWSKY Any use to talk to you about this ? COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY No use ! SZABUNIEWICZ ( Echoes ) No use ! COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( The auctioneer 's last announcement ) Time is fleeting . S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Helplessly , to MADAME BOUFFIER ) No use . ( He turns to COLONEL and concedes all ) Colonel . You 're right ! You are a strategist . You have a plan . If you say west-northwest you have an idea in it  --  and I agree . Which direction you like , I agree . I agree . I agree . ( The COLONEL clamps him on the shoulder as if bestowing an accolade for his good sense but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the CHAUFFEUR 'S lap . Meantime the COLONEL has resumed his place in the car . JACOBOWSKY recovers his balance , runs to MADAME BOUFFIER and to SOLLY , embracing them. ) p. 55 S. L. JACOBOWSKY Good-bye , dear Madame Bouffier . Good-bye , Solly friend . Good-bye in all seven languages . MADAME BOUFFIER Good luck . Good luck , dear friend . ( JACOBOWSKY runs toward the car . The COLONEL steps savagely on the accelerator , but the car does not react . He begins to swear . ) COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY What dirty thing is this ? I give spurs to the villain but she do n't move . S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Shouts to the CHAUFFEUR ) The motor is a fake ! CHAUFFEUR Would I be standing here if the motor was a fake ? The battery needs recharging , that 's all . There is a garage twenty meters away . Everybody out and push COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Scowling ) Now , you see , Jacobowsky , what complications come with you ? SZABUNIEWICZ ( Bitter ) And is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ) Push , gentlemen , push . ( The CHAUFFEUR , JACOBOWSKY , SZABUNIEWICZ and SOLLY all start pushing the car from the rear fender . The COLONEL sits at the wheel , his grandeur undimmed when suddenly he feels the need to invoke a higher power . He rises to his great height , addressing , without turning to look at them , the little strugglers at the rear of the car. ) p. 56 COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Stop ! Nobody knows what lies before us . Therefore I think is wise to call upon the Heaven before we start on the undertaking . ( SZABUNIEWICZ jumps into an attitude of devotion , takes off his hat and puts his hand over his eyes . The CHAUFFEUR also attempts to look other-worldly . JACOBOWSKY does n't know quite what to do . The COLONEL speaks severely ) This means also for you , Jacobowsky . S. L. JACOBOWSKY For me ? Twice for me ! I wept when I was born and every day shows me why .

He intones the words in a liturgical singsong and the sound of them , though strange , conveys somehow the resonant cadence of a great cathedral . He finishes the prayer , puts the prayer book back in his pocket , and in the same voice invokes the future ) I , Tadeusz Boleslav Stjerbinsky , go from Paris not to fly from the Hun but to overthrow him ! ( Suddenly relapsing into the vernacular ) All right , push ! ( The others resume their pushing with all their strength . The COLONEL sits behind the wheel ready to guide the car ) Push ! Push ! ( They strain and push but the car is rooted to the spot. ) p. 57 CHAUFFEUR ( From the tangle ) The brake ! Release the brake ! MADAME BOUFFIER Release the brake , you big fool ! COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Bewildered for a moment ) What ? Brake ? ( Releases the brake ) Oh , the brake ! Push ! Forward ! ( Now the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the CHAUFFEUR pushing strongly , JACOBOWSKY rather more doubtfully . MADAME BOUFFIER , beside herself , begins to cry . She waves her handkerchief at JACOBOWSKY . He takes time off for a moment to wave back to her. ) @x Scene : St. Cyrille . A lonely country road running along a garden wall . The wall is broken by a gate ; the villa faintly visible through the gate beyond thick trees . Summer dusk . From time to time the roar of German planes . MARIANNE , a lovely and vivacious young French woman , slim and girlish , is talking to her lawyer , SEROUILLE , a crotchety old man . MONSIEUR SEROUILLE ( Importuning her ) You are young . You are strong . Life is still before you . I implore you  --  fly , run away , vanish  --  while there is still time  --  before the Germans come . MARIANNE I am surprised at you , Serouille , talking like that . That is defeatism . MONSIEUR SEROUILLE It is realism . MARIANNE I sent for you to settle my boundary dispute with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run away . Are you my lawyer  --  or are you hers ? MONSIEUR SEROUILLE Boundary dispute ! Six feet of pasture and all rocky . MARIANNE But they are my six feet  --  not hers . I love them , every rock , every pebble . On this land I was born . Here my father and grandfather were born . Here I stay ! ( An airplane zooms rather close . It makes a terrific racket. ) p. 59 MONSIEUR SEROUILLE ( Looks up ) Messerschmitt . Admirable ! How undeviating ! Know just what they 're about . MARIANNE ( With hatred ) They trespass over my beautiful fields . How long will our government allow it ? When will they be stopped ? MONSIEUR SEROUILLE Never . MARIANNE I am surprised at you , Monsieur Serouille . Can you conceive that France will no longer be France  --  can you ? MONSIEUR SEROUILLE I can not conceive it but , alas ! I know that it is true . MARIANNE But the whole world is with us  --  the whole world loves France . America ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not materialized in planes , will not stop the Boches ! MARIANNE How can you say that ! The Poles  --  look how they fought ! MONSIEUR SEROUILLE But what good was it ? The Poles they were done for six months ago . The Germans are a very few miles to the north . What are you waiting for ? MARIANNE Right now I am waiting for the return of my lover  --  a noble Pole  --  Colonel Tadeusz Boleslav Stjerbinsky . Is n't it a lovely name ? p. 60 MONSIEUR SEROUILLE ( Shakes his head ) He will not return . MARIANNE He will ! Moreover he will return with men , with planes , with guns . He did not go to Paris for nothing . MONSIEUR SEROUILLE I see there is nothing I can do . MARIANNE You can do what I engaged you to do . You can get me back that piece of land from that ugly , thieving Madame Vauclain . MONSIEUR SEROUILLE ( With a little laugh ) In forty-eight hours at most your land and her land will both belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insist on a clear title ? They are not so meticulous . MARIANNE When our deliverance comes I shall not remind you that you have talked like this . MONSIEUR SEROUILLE ( Turns to go ) I have done what I could . MARIANNE ( Calls after him ) And tell Vauclain if she goes to court it is she who will have to pay the costs ! MONSIEUR SEROUILLE ( Wearily ) I 'll tell her . MARIANNE That 'll teach her  --  the pennypincher ! p. 61 MONSIEUR SEROUILLE Yes . The world loves us . But the Nazis  --  they covet us !

The barking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Oh , Coco ! ( She-runs through the gate and disappears in the garden . ) ( For a second the scene is empty , only the disconsolate peep-peep of crickets audible . Gradually we hear the reluctant pounding and thrashing of an exhausted automobile motor . The sputtering approach can be followed as it comes closer and at last JACOBOWSKY 'S limousine appears , mud-bespattered , rattling , inching in by jerks . It runs into a heap of stones put up as a tank-obstruction . The car , its right to live impaired , halts with a sharp bump , the doors fly open . The first to tumble out is JACOBOWSKY . SZABUNIEWICZ hurries around and looks at the freshly smashed mudguard . The COLONEL , tall and leisurely , stands looking around with satisfaction. ) p. 62 COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY We arrive ! S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Rather short-tempered ) Yes . But where ?

SZABUNIEWICZ ( Tapping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make laugh the Germans . S. L. JACOBOWSKY Are we running away from the Germans or do we have a rendezvous with them ? Colonel , you will never know what these twelve hours have cost me ! COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Fixes him with a blue-eyed military stare ) Cost you ? Polish Government pay you back everything . Szabuniewicz , child , write down everything what we owe this merchant . Myself I have no head for figures . SZABUNIEWICZ Figures leave to me COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Therefore every time write down . Everything write down .

JACOBOWSKY Write down in your head the Polish Government in Exile owes me the following : Replacement One : a heart which has begun to flutter like a wounded bird ; Replacement Two : one wrecked nervous system , plus body ditto . And , if the Germans catch me , one entire Jacobowsky . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what costs him this car ? SZABUNIEWICZ Seventeen thousand francs .

Jacobowsky ! For this amount thirty-five thousand we toss the coin ! Double or nothing . Give me coin ! Top I win . Bottom you win . ( Takes coin from JACOBOWSKY . He tosses it into his palm , and reaches out his palm for SZABUNIEWICZ to register the result . SZABUNIEWICZ looks at coin and pockets it. ) p. 64 SZABUNIEWICZ Polish Government owe him now seventy thousand francs . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Lavishly ) Write down !

This Messiah in the gray gloves who is waiting to save you in St. Jean de Luz is not in a hurry ? That corvette filled with Czechs and Poles is not in a hurry ? ( SZABUNIEWICZ is brushing the COLONEL 'S uniform . ) COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY This corvette for us  --  not for you . S. L. JACOBOWSKY I know . But I want a sight of the ocean . Perhaps for me , too , a Moses will appear and will divide the Channel and let me walk across to England .

COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY In your case this ambition is trivial . ( He looks at SZABUNIEWICZ to get appreciation for his little joke . SZABUNIEWICZ responds . They both laugh . SZABUNIEWICZ hands the COLONEL a comb and holds a mirror while the COLONEL combs his hair . ) You do not realize that I , Stjerbinsky , under greater danger than little Jacobowsky . On my head the Germans have put price ! ( He returns the comb to SZABUNIEWICZ . ) S. L. JACOBOWSKY At the rate you 're going , they 'll collect it ! Is this a time to stop for ladies ? p. 66 COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Life of man is short but always time to think of ladies . For my spirit  --  this is the fuel .

COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY You always play second fiddle . S. L. JACOBOWSKY What 's wrong with second ? You need as much technique as to play first ! Only I did n't have it ! COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Holds his violin lovingly ) On all the fronts she has been my companion . S. L. JACOBOWSKY Powerful instrument in the war of nerves . ( COLONEL beats time for SZABUNIEWICZ with his bow and then , his back to the audience , facing the house of his beloved , he goes into Drigo 's " Serenade " while SZABUNIEWICZ accompanies him on the mouth organ .

JACOBOWSKY For the moment . I am a subtle man , and I have read much , but the Colonel here has a faculty worth more than all my subtleties . He will escape with you , but he will also return with you and he will fight for you . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY I do not need you to speak for me , Monsieur . S. L.

JACOBOWSKY jumps into the back of the car ; obeying some reflex , though the top is down and he is exposed to the heavens , he bends , pulling his coat collar over his head . The plane recedes . Cautiously he straightens up , feeling his body all over . He has not observed the entrance of a BRIGADIER of the Gendarmerie on a bicycle . Now the BRIGADIER dismounts . He wears a red cap and service pouch . ) S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Very friendly , to the BRIGADIER ) Good evening . p. 76 BRIGADIER ( Businesslike ) Good evening . Your identification , please . ( JACOBOWSKY gets out of the car , starts fishing out his documents , and hands the paper to BRIGADIER . ) S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Sighs ) Ah ! The one fate you ca n't escape  --  your own identity . BRIGADIER ( More politely ) Literary man ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY Only as a lover . Not a practitioner . BRIGADIER Your safe-conduct pass , please . S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Mastering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have no right to fluctuate freely without the proper authorization . S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Dryly ) But I 'm fluctuating under compulsion , not freely . All of France is fluctuating now . BRIGADIER To be more specific , what are your personal plans , Monsieur ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY My personal plans are so fluid I 'm apt to drown in them . BRIGADIER ( Rattling off the rigmarole  --  tapping papers ) This paper gives your basic place of residence as Paris . If you desire to change your basic place of residence , you are required to submit to the Commissariat of Police of your precinct an application for stamped forms wherein you request the privilege of changing your residence . The Commissariat of Police will transmit your application to the Prefecture , which , after careful investigation and examination , will forward it to the Central Military Bureau of Circulation who will then decide in accordance with the prevailing situation in regard to transportation and communication whether you have the right to move to this spot to which you have already moved . p. 77 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumor by any chance reached you that Paris is about to fall to the Germans ? BRIGADIER When it happens , that will be a mere fact . It will not alter the provisions of the law . You are accordingly required to proceed forthwith to Paris , Monsieur , and follow the legally prescribed course . Otherwise you are illegally , illicitly and surreptitiously standing on this highway . You are standing before me only de facto , not de jure . S. L. JACOBOWSKY That means arrest and shipping off to Paris ? BRIGADIER In accordance with the regulations . S. L. JACOBOWSKY You know what the Boches will do with me if they catch me ? BRIGADIER They wo n't eat you . S. L. JACOBOWSKY Especially me . For them I am caviar ! BRIGADIER If they do execute you , at least you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you have not broken the regulations of France . S. L. JACOBOWSKY I shall die happy . BRIGADIER With a clear conscience . A good way to die S. L. JACOBOWSKY Tell me , sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unofficial answer until nine o'clock , when I shall be off duty S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Looks at his watch ) Three to nine . What I was going to ask was Officer , I have an irresistible compulsion to leave the soil of France . How should I go about it ? BRIGADIER For the purpose of leaving France you require a visa de sortie . For this purpose you must apply to the nearest Sous-Prefecture , at Sable d'Olonnes , for such a visa de sortie , first executing three questionnaires , each with one photograph , profile , showing right ear , and paying a fee of twenty-seven francs , seventy-five centimes . The Sous-Prefecture will communicate with the Prefecture of your basic place of residence , Paris , and will , by extended correspondence , compile a dossier of your case , which , after a few weeks , will be submitted to the Ministry of the Interior for further action . ( They consult their watches ) The Ministry of the Interior instructs a special commission to investigate whether you were worthy to set foot on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . That takes a certain amount of time , but goes through with the greatest smoothness . There is , however , difficulty in your case . You must first return to Paris , and await your safe-conduct pass , permitting you to come here . Is that clear ? p. 79 S. L. JACOBOWSKY Crystal ! BRIGADIER Monsieur is very intelligent . However , I must frankly tell you that even if you fulfill all the requirements I have just enumerated , your prospects are nil . After all , what consideration can you expect from a government which you have caused so much clerical work ? You 'd better come along with me right now . S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Looks at watch ) Nine o'clock ! BRIGADIER ( Greatly relieved ) Nine ? Good  --  then I 'm off duty . ( He and JACOBOWSKY both sit on bench , quite relaxed ) Now I can talk to you unofficially . S. L. JACOBOWSKY What would you do if you were me ? BRIGADIER You want to go down the coast to Bayonne and beyond . Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shore roads to begin with . They are advancing fast along the coast . S. L.

She has two baskets containing Coco and Mignon . She is surprised to see the BRIGADIER. ) p. 80 BRIGADIER That 's a pity . S. L. JACOBOWSKY Could you help me ? Is there ? BRIGADIER ( Sees MARIANNE , rises ) Good evening , Mamselle Roualet . MARIANNE Oh , good evening . Monsieur Jacobowsky  --  would you help me ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Goes to her , takes baskets ) You remember my name ? MARIANNE Why should n't I ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY Some people have difficulty . MARIANNE Will you please  --  Coco and Mignon  --  they hate leaving home as much as I do . S. L. JACOBOWSKY I 'll make them comfortable . I love animals . They accept you without reservation . ( He puts the baskets carefully in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) This gentleman is taking us off in his car . BRIGADIER ( To JACOBOWSKY ) Why did n't you tell me ? MARIANNE And a noble Polish officer  --  who will return one day to fight for France . Do you think it dreadful of me to leave ? p. 81 BRIGADIER ( Warmly ) No , it is good you are going . S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Calls across to the BRIGADIER , urgently ) Gasoline  --  gasoline . BRIGADIER ( Stamping document ) Take this stamped document . My colleague in St. Cyrille will furnish you with thirty gallons at the standard price . ( He hands him the stamped paper . JACOBOWSKY takes it . ) S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Moved ) My friend . My dear friend . How is it possible to thank a man like you ? BRIGADIER ( Gets back on his bicycle . Crisply ) Carry the greetings of Brigadier Jouet to England and to America . S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Fervently ) I shall . I shall . BRIGADIER ( To MARIANNE ) Mamselle Roualet , I bless you . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AND MARIANNE ( Simultaneously ) Amen . BRIGADIER If I were younger , I would go with you . But all I can do is put stamps on papers . Monsieur , I am happy to have given you what may be my last stamp for France .

L. JACOBOWSKY You will see them . MARIANNE ( Torn ) My poor country . S. L. JACOBOWSKY It will be re-born . There will be a new France , a new world  --  because the old one is sick of its own ineptitude . MARIANNE You are a comfort , Monsieur . S. L. JACOBOWSKY You make me wish for youth that I might return and fight too . MARIANNE Thank you , Monsieur . S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Involuntarily ) I shall dedicate myself to you . MARIANNE ( Rather amused ) Thank you , Monsieur . S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you any other pets ? MARIANNE Only the Colonel . S. L. JACOBOWSKY To him I am already dedicated . p. 83 MARIANNE ( Laughing out loud ) So am I. ( JACOBOWSKY joins in her laughter . The COLONEL comes in carrying a little hatbox . He is surprised at the rapport there seems to have sprung up between MARIANNE and JACOBOWSKY . ) COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY What you laughing at ? MARIANNE Nothing . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( To JACOBOWSKY ) Why do you laugh ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY For no reason . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY You get gasoline ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Softly ) Gasoline came to us . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY What does he talk  --  us ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY A warm rain came down from heaven and behold  --  it was gasoline . MARIANNE ( Sharing his mood ) Pipeline from the sky ! ( They both laugh again . ) COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Now what do you laugh at ? p. 84 S. L. JACOBOWSKY Nothing . MARIANNE Nothing .

COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( To SZABUNIEWICZ ) Less and less I like this Jacobowsky ! SZABUNIEWICZ ( Echoes ) Less and less . ( He lifts large bag and is about to throw it into the car . ) MARIANNE ( Concerned for her pets ) Mignon  --  Coco S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Goes over , puts bag in carefully ) They 're in a safe place . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Bursts out ) Not to worry , Marianne . Everyone safe . Dogs safe . You safe . Szabuniewicz safe . I safe . All protect by Monsieur Jacobowsky. p. 85 S. L. JACOBOWSKY I do not undertake quite so much , Colonel . Only these little dogs  --  for them I am Goliath  --  a miniature Goliath . ( MARIANNE laughs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARIANNE I do n't know . He makes me laugh . Why are you so bad-tempered ? ( SZABUNIEWICZ has already started packing boxes in the car . ) COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Roars ) Marianne , can not take all those packages ! SZABUNIEWICZ ( Lifting hatbox ) He travels light . S. L. JACOBOWSKY Plenty of room . MARIANNE Perhaps we can leave behind one bandbox . S. L. JACOBOWSKY I would n't hear of it . ( He takes hatbox from SZABUNIEWICZ and puts it in car . ) COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Roars at him ) Who you not to hear of anything ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( To COLONEL ) Let me explain , Colonel . You are a great man but as a refugee I am more experienced . Let me tell you  --  nothing is so warming to morale in difficult hours as to have a few precious , familiar knickknacks with you . It restores your identity  --  gives you a link with the past , a bridge to what you were . It 's important , believe me , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 86 MARIANNE ( Drawn to him ) You are so understanding , Monsieur Jacobowsky . ( The COLONEL towers above them while MARIANNE and JACOBOWSKY talk to each other . ) S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( To MARIANNE under the shadow of this tower ) It 's experience , Mademoiselle , simple experience . ( They both laugh again . ) COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Walks between them in a rage ) All right ! Take whole damn business , only let 's go . You make of this car a furniture truck . MARIANNE We 'll compromise . I 'll give up this hatbox . ( SZABUNIEWICZ picks up the tiny hatbox . ) COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Sarcastic ) This will be great help ! SZABUNIEWICZ ( Seized with a bright idea , whispers to COLONEL ) Colonel , sew papers in little hat . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Assimilating the idea slowly ) What you say ? SZABUNIEWICZ Hide documents in little hat . p. 87 COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Straightens up . Announces pridefully  --  any idea SZABUNIEWICZ might have belongs to him automatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this bandbox , Marianne . In your little hat you sew my documents . Germans will never look there for them . ( He is very owlish about this . ) S. L. JACOBOWSKY It is an inspiration ! MARIANNE ( Bubbling ) And it will make me feel so important . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Now at last we go ! Marianne , the back seat . ( He gets in and sits at the wheel ) Szabuniewicz  --  beside me . ( SZABUNIEWICZ complies . ) MARIANNE ( Barely fitting into a pile of luggage in the back seat , looks around to JACOBOWSKY ) It 's so crowded here . Where will you sit ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Darting forward ) With great happiness at your feet . ( He gets in the back of the car , sitting on the floor at MARIANNE 'S feet , his own on the running board . ) COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Turning from the wheel ) Szabuniewicz  --  change places with him . p. 88 MARIANNE ( As SZABUNIEWICZ starts to comply ; pats JACOBOWSKY ) No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( To SZABUNIEWICZ ) Less and less I like this Jacobowsky . SZABUNIEWICZ ( Echoes ) Less and less . MARIANNE ( Consoling JACOBOWSKY ) Never mind ! ( She smiles down at the ravished JACOBOWSKY , who looks up at her adoringly . SZABUNIEWICZ bangs the front door . The fretting vehicle moves off . ) Curtain p. 89 Act 2 , Scene 2 ACT TWOSCENE II SCENE : An open spot in the woods near the city of Bayonne . An overcast summer day . In the background on the highway , somewhat elevated , stands JACOBOWSKY 'S car even more battered than before . In the middle distance a little stream winds through at which passing refugees stop to drink . AT RISE : In the foreground on a little slope at the right MARIANNE sits on a small trunk at the foot of an immense haystack . At her feet is the COLONEL 'S civilian coat , quite tattered . The COLONEL is wearing civvies , corduroy trousers and an old shirt . It is the first time we have seen him without his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shabby misfits he feels himself deprived of his identity . He is moodily fighting melancholia . When the curtain goes up , MARIANNE has just finished sewing the COLONEL 'S papers in her little hat . She holds up the hat , pleased at her own handiwork . MARIANNE There  --  I 've sewn your precious papers in my hat . Who would ever think that in this frivolous little hat are the names of the future saviors of Poland ? ( She puts the hat in the hatbox ) And now , I 'll finish your poor coat ! ( She picks up his coat and sews . ) COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Without my uniform  --  I feel like not a man ! p. 90 MARIANNE ( Gently , humoring him ) Were you never without a uniform before ? COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Never ! MARIANNE You were n't born in a uniform , were you ? COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Automatically ) Yes . ( Amending his statement ) My father cavalry officer . My grandfather cavalry officer ! We Stjerbinskys always in uniform . MARIANNE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY When I am little boy I dress up ! Always in my dreams I am in uniform . MARIANNE ( With a look at the ragged coat ) Well , this is a kind of uniform too , is n't it ? COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY These filthy rags ? MARIANNE There is a time to advance and a time to retreat . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY That sounds like Monsieur Jacobowsky . MARIANNE What you are wearing now is the uniform of retreat . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Please , I beg you not to quote to me Monsieur Jacobowsky. p. 91 MARIANNE Why not ? COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Because , if I have to govern myself with his mentality , I rather die . MARIANNE Monsieur Jacobowsky says it is easy to die . But to live requires ingenuity . This uniform is part of the ingenuity . ( Patting the mended shoulder ) There ! I have just sewed on your epaulettes ! Look at this hole  --  sword thrust ! This missing button  --  a sharpshooter ! This lapel  --  what a fierce hand-to-hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could dream the most heroic exploits . In so many ways you are still a little boy . Go on dreaming ! COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY I can not dream myself hero in costume like this . MARIANNE We used to have a picture in our bedroom when I was a little girl  --  the Grande Armee returning through the snows of Russia . They were in rags , poor things . I used to shiver for them . Compared to what they wore this battle-scarred coat ( She holds up the poor garment ) is quite grand . In your uniform you were a symbol , darling . Wonderful , but a symbol . But in this you are a human being . I 'm glad for once to have seen you in it . I love you in it . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY This also sounds like Monsieur Jacobowsky. p. 92 MARIANNE It 's not very flattering of you to assume that I am an echo of Monsieur Jacobowsky . Am I so stupid ? COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY When first I know you you do not talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was so close and thrilling that , as I recall it , we did n't talk at all . There was no time between kisses . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Bitterly ) But now there is plenty of time ! MARIANNE Yes . The roads are so crowded  --  the waits so long , for meals , for a place to sleep , for a drop of gasoline . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY And this time mainly you use to talk to Monsieur Jacobowsky ! MARIANNE Yes . It passes the time . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Tensely ) What you talk about ? MARIANNE All sorts of things . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Sometimes I come upon you , you stop talking . Sudden you stop . MARIANNE Do we ? COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Why you stop ? p. 93 MARIANNE I do n't know . I suppose because Monsieur Jacobowsky is afraid you wo n't be sympathetic or interested . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY I do n't ask why he stop  --  I ask why you stop . MARIANNE Do I ? COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I suppose I must feel the same as Monsieur Jacobowsky feels  --  that you wo n't be sympathetic or interested . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( The damning evidence is now in his possession . He draws himself up accusingly ) This is how I suspect . You no longer feel like me . You feel like Monsieur Jacobowsky . MARIANNE Is n't it possible to feel like you both ? COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY No . Never . Impossible . MARIANNE ( Laughs ) Darling ! COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY You laugh at me . MARIANNE A little . In this hard journey  --  do you grudge me a little laugh ? p. 94 COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY But not at me . To this I am not used . MARIANNE All right , Tadeusz . If it will make you feel better , I will not laugh any more . There ! ( The coat is finished . He puts it on . It hangs on him clumsily . She does her best to make it fit ) Shoulder better ? COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Shoulder better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll mend that too . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Tragic ) You do n't mend . You break . MARIANNE Darling , because you catch me talking nonsense with poor little Monsieur Jacobowsky ! COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Fixed idea ) If nonsense , then why you stop when I come ? MARIANNE Perhaps it 's because you 're a hero . Too epic for nonsense . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY This also sounds like Monsieur Jacobowsky . MARIANNE ( With self-revelation , with surprise ) Yes , it does ! It 's just like him ! COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY He loves you , this Monsieur Jacobowsky. p. 95 MARIANNE ( Walks to brook and sits down beside it ) Ridiculous ! What an idea ! Do you think so ? Perhaps he does  --  a little bit . Oh ! It 's touching . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY You love him too . MARIANNE Now , Tadeusz , do n't be silly . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Then what you see in him ? Why you like him ? MARIANNE ( Exploring her own mind ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like him better than me ! MARIANNE ( Scrupulously honest ) In one way perhaps . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Triumphant ) Ah , you admit ! Why ? Why ? MARIANNE ( Resolute ) I will tell you why . He makes me more  --  you make me less . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Scientifically ) I think it necessary I kill this Monsieur Jacobowsky . I fight him . MARIANNE You 're so absent-minded . You forget it 's the Germans you 're fighting . ( She wanders back to the trunk at the foot of the haystack and sits. ) p. 96 COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Then what you want I do with him ? Engage in arguments with him ? MARIANNE Why not ? Good for you . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY I do not argue with people like Jacobowsky over the woman I love . MARIANNE ( Teasing him ) Oh , it does n't have to be about me . You can argue with him over all sorts of subjects  --  abstract subjects . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY You make fun of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do with you ! COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Never did I believe that I , Stjerbinsky , would wear costume like this and have for rival S. L. Jacobowsky . MARIANNE ( With gusto ) Both good for you ! COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Ah ! You admit ! MARIANNE Admit what ? COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY He is my rival . MARIANNE Not so much your rival , darling , as COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY As what ? p. 97 MARIANNE Your antidote ! ( A silence ) The odd thing is , darling , Monsieur Jacobowsky adores you . ( She goes to COLONEL , trying to win sympathy for JACOBOWSKY , pleading with him , but the COLONEL 'S expression is impassive ) He 's constantly telling me how wonderful you are . ( She keeps stealing glances at him but so far no change ) He envies you . He wants you to love him . He wants the whole world to love him . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( With satisfaction ) In this he will never succeed . MARIANNE He knows that . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How gentle he is . Do n't you find it  --  appealing ? He wants so to be loved . I find it very  --  very COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Obviously you do ! MARIANNE What shall I do then ? Not speak to him ? Ignore him ? It 's his car , after all . We 're his guests . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Polish Government pay him in full  --  with profit . MARIANNE Then we 're all guests of the Polish Government . Shall I be rude to a fellow guest ? ( The COLONEL looks at her . He decides on a new attack. ) p. 98 COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( He sidles over to her , tries to be light and gay ) Marianne ? MARIANNE Yes , my dear . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY You and I  --  why we do n't talk about trivial things ? Why we do n't laugh together ? MARIANNE ( Moved , but with a gleam . He sits beside her on the trunk ) I 'm willing . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Casting about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something about ballistics ? MARIANNE Very little , but I 'd love to learn . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY You know , is very interesting science , ballistics . The trajectory of a cannon ball is a beautiful thing . My father used to draw me pictures when I am a boy of the trajectory the cannon balls make through space . He drew with different colored chalks . Like a rainbow they looked . MARIANNE ( Solemnly appreciative ) It must have been beautiful . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Dejected ) No good ! p. 99 MARIANNE ( Looks up at him ) What ? COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY This subject , ballistics , not trivial enough . MARIANNE Let 's try something else . ( Pause . ) COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY My **29;256;TOOLONG when Napoleon came to Poland danced with him in Grand Ball in Warsaw . MARIANNE Was she beautiful ? COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Very beautiful . She danced with Napoleon ! MARIANNE That 's very interesting . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY It 's history . ( Pause . ) MARIANNE Have you her picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense of defeat ) Whose picture ? MARIANNE Your grandmother 's . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Oh , yes . In my home in Poland  --  but that home probably now destroyed by the Germans . MARIANNE ( Sadly ) Like all our homes . p. 100 COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Damn to hell . This subject is too tragic . It does not make you laugh like Monsieur Jacobowsky . MARIANNE Oh , darling , do n't try to be like Monsieur Jacobowsky . You have your style  --  he has his . I love you both . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Smarting with a sense of defeat and snapping back to his own identity , rises ) My course is clear . We fight . MARIANNE Oh , my God ! COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY No way out . We fight . MARIANNE ( Worried , rises ) Have you no other way of coping with a situation than to fight ? COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY For a man of honor is no other way . MARIANNE I wish , in addition to being a man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough for you ? MARIANNE I wish you had a little humor . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY When I love I do not laugh . MARIANNE We French do . We manage both very well . Please , Tadeusz , be a darling and get off your high horse . Shake out of the stiff corset of your code . Relax a bit and admit the human race . p. 101 COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Worked up more and more ) This idea you also get from Jacobowsky ! MARIANNE ( Furious , stamps her foot ) Do n't keep saying that ! I knew the alphabet before I met you or Monsieur Jacobowsky . You do n't know me at all . What makes you think you know anything about me ? COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY I realize now this ignorance . Monsieur Jacobowsky  --  he make me realize MARIANNE Then you should be grateful to him . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY I am . I will show my gratitude by allowing him to engage me on the field of honor . MARIANNE The field of honor ! It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tadeusz . ( COLONEL opens his mouth for the refrain but she beats him to it , shouting ) Yes , that idea I got from Monsieur Jacobowsky ! ( They glare at each other , openly hostile . ) ( SZABUNIEWICZ limps on dejectedly . He has been walking for quite a while . He leans against the haystack , exhausted , taking off his shoes meanwhile . ) SZABUNIEWICZ Is no food  --  nothing ! p. 102 COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Working off his anger on SZABUNIEWICZ , shouts at him ) I promise Madame you bring to eat , you ! SZABUNIEWICZ In Bayonne city not even room to walk ! All streets is full opp wid autos , wid no gasoline , like us . All hotel and cafe full opp . And the prices ! The shops is wiped clean . ( Some refugees drift by , loaded with bags and bundles . The OLD MAN and the LITTLE BOY we have seen before stop at the brook . The OLD MAN fills a cup and gives the LITTLE BOY a drink . ) MARIANNE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France . ( Watching the refugees as they walk down the road ) Where are they going ? They walk , but where do they go ? COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( To SZABUNIEWICZ ) Where is this Jacobowsky ? You go forage with him . Where is he ? SZABUNIEWICZ I look around  --  he is gone . ( Cocking one eye at the sky ) Soon it rain . My corn fall off with walking . I go in car and sleep . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY You only good to sleep , you ! SZABUNIEWICZ Good we all sleep ! Dream we eat maybe ! ( He waddles off toward the car , curls up on back seat and goes to sleep . ) ( Between the COLONEL and MARIANNE a moody pause . It is a bad moment . The COLONEL sits on the trunk. ) p. 103 COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Out of his despair ) Anything I endure but that you do not love me . This I can not . MARIANNE ( Goes and kneels by COLONEL ) Oh , I do love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you that I would leave France for even one hour . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Straightens up ) Then I am able for anything . ( He kisses her ) My melancholy vanish like mist before the sun . ( He gets up , lifting her up with him . ) MARIANNE There 's no reason in the world for you to be sad . Be happy . Be happy in my love . ( She embraces him . ) COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Beams at her ) I struggle for you . I fight for you . I move mountains for you . MARIANNE And will you also be good to poor Monsieur Jacobowsky for me ? COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( His hands clench ) For you  --  yes . MARIANNE You give up this silly notion of fighting him ? p. 104 COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY For you  --  yes . MARIANNE That 's my dear boy . ( She embraces and kisses COLONEL . ) S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Breezes in ; he is very gay ) Hello ! COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into ) Is here possible no privacy ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( He is lugging a bulging straw shopping bag . He is beaming ) I met my brother-in-law 's cousin ! Would you think it  --  in Bayonne ! MARIANNE ( To COLONEL , smiling ) His family connections are something fabulous ! S. L. JACOBOWSKY He used to be a conductor of the Gewandhaus Orchestra in Leipzig . Now he 's a headwaiter in the leading cafe in Bayonne . He introduced me to the proprietor  --  and the proprietor  --  for a price  --  let me have some very interesting commodities . ( Shows bag . ) MARIANNE ( Ecstatic ) Food ! COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Resentful at JACOBOWSKY 'S success ) You got something to eat ? p. 105 S. L. JACOBOWSKY Special . Very special . ( He holds up a chop ) For Coco ! MARIANNE You remembered Coco ! S. L. JACOBOWSKY As you love Coco  --  I love Coco . ( Gives her the chop . ) COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY You have large heart it seems ! S. L. JACOBOWSKY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we will create the atmosphere of a picnic ? ( Muttering to himself , the COLONEL picks up a rolled rug that is lying in the grass and gives it to MARIANNE . She spreads it out . JACOBOWSKY throws down his hat and overcoat , inadvertently throwing his coat over MARIANNE 'S hatbox . MARIANNE sits on the shawl , JACOBOWSKY on the trunk , taking packages out of bag ) Just as I was walking out of the cafe after being told there was nothing , there he was  --  my brother-in-law 's cousin . He fell on my neck and I fell on his . At home I never liked him . I hated his conducting . I once said : " He does n't understand Mozart no more than a headwaiter , " and look , now he is a headwaiter ! MARIANNE ( Gaily ) Tadeusz , give Coco her little chop , will you ? ( The COLONEL , struggling to control himself , obeys . He takes the chop from her gingerly and goes back with it to the car . JACOBOWSKY keeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blanket. ) p. 106 S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( As he puts them down one by one , he apostrophizes the delicacies ) These , my dear Sigismund  --  that 's my brother-in-law 's cousin  --  this loaf of bread fresh from the oven  --  erases the memory of your Don Giovanni which you played like a pig . ( By this time the COLONEL has reached the car and waked up SZABUNIEWICZ . ) SZABUNIEWICZ ( Grunting ) What for you do n't let me sleep ? COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY I do n't sleep , you do n't sleep . SZABUNIEWICZ Go way , let me sleep . S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Picking up pastry box ) And these crisp brioches  --  your Figaro  --  which was even worse . Ah , Marianne , the God of War transmutes a bad conductor into a perfect headwaiter . Mars has a knack for vocational guidance . ( MARIANNE laughs . ) MARIANNE And you , Monsieur Jacobowsky , what has Mars done for you ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY He introduced me to you . Without him I should never have known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 107 S. L. JACOBOWSKY It 's a bargain counter . I 'd rather be in France escaping with you than getting a big welcome-home reception anywhere else . ( They become aware that the COLONEL has returned and is lowering over them . They freeze up suddenly . ) MARIANNE Oh , but COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Why do you stop talking ? MARIANNE We do n't . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY You do . What were you saying , Monsieur Jacobowsky ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Blushing a little ) I do n't remember . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Menacing ) You do n't remember ! S. L. JACOBOWSKY It was nothing at all . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( To MARIANNE ) Marianne , what was he saying ? MARIANNE It was nothing at all . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY If it nothing at all why you do n't go on saying nothing at all ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY Before a man like you , savior of countries , we ca n't be trivial . p. 108 COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY This explanation is not satisfactory . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Tadeusz ! S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Taking bottle from bag ) Oh ! I suppose you thought , Colonel , that I had forgotten you . Not at all . I thought you 'd like this fine cognac . ( Presents him with a bottle of cognac . ) COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Looking at it ) 1912  --  bad year . ( Gives JACOBOWSKY the bottle . ) ( SZABUNIEWICZ rouses himself and gets out of car . ) S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Takes bottle back ) A bad year but a good bottle . Sigismund tried it . ( Smiles ) May I pour for you ? ( He is about to pour the brandy into a paper cup when the COLONEL stops him . ) COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Growling ) Not from paper cup . Szabuniewicz , my silver cup . ( Takes bottle ; to JACOBOWSKY ) You drink from paper cup . All right for you ! p. 109 S. L. JACOBOWSKY Today I 'm drinking water . ( He goes to the brook . ) MARIANNE Some water for me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings MARIANNE a drink of water ! ) SZABUNIEWICZ ( Gives silver cup to COLONEL ; sees the banquet ) Who give eat ? ( He makes for the food . ) S. L. JACOBOWSKY Help yourself , my friend . MARIANNE I 'll make a sandwich for you , Tadeusz . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Drinking ) I not have hunger . SZABUNIEWICZ ( Picking up dried fish ) Women and fish best in the middle . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Kicks him ) Szabuniewicz , not to be impertinent . Do n't forget your place . SZABUNIEWICZ ( In full mutiny ) When you not in uniform I man like you and I make jokes like anybody else  --  huh ! ( He backs away before the menacing COLONEL and sits on a little embankment upstage , eating hardboiled eggs. ) p. 110 COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Swallowing more cognac ) Marianne , I apologize for this lout . S. L. JACOBOWSKY Do n't drink too much , Colonel . Please . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Indignant ) Who you to speak to me this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candle , Chauffeur , we 'll all be in the dark . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Swallows again ) You got gasoline in pocket too ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY I 'm working on the problem . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Polish Government now owe you six hundred thousand francs . Double or nothing you not get gasoline today ! S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Trying to conciliate him with food ) Try one of these hard-boiled eggs , my friend . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( His suppressed anger mounting ) Jacobowsky , I resent you drink water . S. L. JACOBOWSKY Is that all about me you resent ? COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY No ! p. 111 MARIANNE Tadeusz , please stop this ! COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Stop what ? MARIANNE You owe Monsieur an apology ! COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY I owe him ! MARIANNE Yes , you do . I do n't want any more nonsense about Monsieur Jacobowsky . Many women I am telling you would be very lucky to get him  --  especially in times like these ! COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Drawing himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I challenge you ! S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Startled ) Challenge ! COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Yes ! S. L. JACOBOWSKY To what ? COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY To a duel . To fight . S. L. JACOBOWSKY What for ? ( Instinctively he draws to MARIANNE and she to him . He takes her hand in his . ) COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Enraged ) Szabuniewicz  --  the pistols . ( To JACOBOWSKY ) Take your hand away from her ! p. 112 MARIANNE ( Holding onto JACOBOWSKY 'S hand ) Not while you threaten ! COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( To JACOBOWSKY ) Seducer by sobriety ! Other men I can out-drink , out-fight  --  what I do with you ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY Marianne , I should go away . MARIANNE ( Stamps her foot ) I wo n't have this  --  you hear  --  I wo n't have it ! S. L. JACOBOWSKY I have felt it coming . We must part . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY No . We do not part . ( He drinks more cognac . ) S. L. JACOBOWSKY He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want me to go ! SZABUNIEWICZ It is the cognac . Colonel always melancholy when he drink ! COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Storms ) Silence ! ( The outburst is so tremendous that SZABUNIEWICZ chokes over his egg . ) SZABUNIEWICZ ( Still choking ) Swallop opp whole egg ! p. 113 MARIANNE Tadeusz , what 's the matter ? COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Cognac make a man to see more clear . Jacobowsky , you afraid of me ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY Yes . ( Turns to MARIANNE ) I heard in Bayonne the armistice has been signed in Wiesbaden . The Germans are going to occupy most of France . We have to think of gasoline , how to get to the coast . ( He sits on the trunk . ) COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Why do you fear me ? MARIANNE ( Really frightened now ) Tadeusz , what 's come over you ? ( MARIANNE stares at the COLONEL hypnotized . JACOBOWSKY keeps looking from one to the other of these two suddenly strange people . ) COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( In a spasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is afraid of me . I tell you truth  --  I am afraid of him . S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Murmurs ) Thank you for the compliment ! COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Whirls on him ) Yes . I , Stjerbinsky , who have fought the Nazis on the Pruth and on the Somme and on the Vistula , I who have never known fear  --  now I know fear . I 'm afraid of you , Jacobowsky . I am afraid of the thoughts you have that you make her share , the laughter that dries up when I approach . I am afraid of the silence you make between me and Marianne . Talk against you I can not . But fight you I can . Fight you I must . To prove to myself that I do not fear , I fight . Because if I fear , I die . p. 114 S. L. JACOBOWSKY But to prove this to yourself probably I 'll have to die . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Perhaps you kill me , why not ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY Why not ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STJERBINSKY ( Shouts ) You are too practical ! S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( To MARIANNE ) Too practical ! That 's the trouble , Marianne , he is a fifteenth-century man but , unfortunately , I live in the twentieth . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Growls ) Twentieth century I do not like . S. L. JACOBOWSKY I do n't like it either , but what can we do about it ? COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY In twentieth century no poetry , no heroism , no honor . Twentieth century full with fleas and disinfectant , disinfectant and fleas . Everything sanitary , sterilized ! Small rooms , good cheap manufacture , mouth wash , chromium fixture , umbrellas and those stuff ! Everything in this damn century got to have sense ! But where is style ? Who gives elegance ? These things I see no more ! What is modern is small . You are small man , Jacobowsky . By fighting you I give you stature . What Nazis take away from you , I , Stjerbinsky , give you back  --  honor ! ( JACOBOWSKY rises. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SZABUNIEWICZ ( Murmurs ) She 's right , Colonel . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Turns on him . Grabs him by collar ) I am your superior officer . When war is over and Poland triumphant  --  I court-martial you ! SZABUNIEWICZ ( Terrified ) Forgive me . Forgive me . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY I forgive , but I do not forget . Get the pistols ! ( SZABUNIEWICZ goes to car , gets pistols . COLONEL confronts JACOBOWSKY ) Jacobowsky , between us stands woman . Marianne  --  please go to the car . ( She stands silent , held as if in a spell . ) S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( With sudden determination  --  suddenly carried away ) And what if I kill you ! Why not ? In my veins flows the blood of great fighters  --  David , Saul And the truth is  --  yes  --  the truth is you are right , Colonel . I do love her ! I am in love with her . I am happy to say the words for once . I am happy to hear the words for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love her ! Pistols ! ( He takes pistol from SZABUNIEWICZ . To MARIANNE ) Marianne , will you forgive me if I kill him ?

What hope ? ( SZABUNIEWICZ helps COLONEL take off his coat . The COLONEL rolls up his sleeves , preparing for the fight . ) S. L. JACOBOWSKY Before we begin  --  Szabuniewicz is your second  --  who is mine ? MARIANNE ( Involuntarily ) I am ! S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( With a keen look at her , tapping the pistol to indicate his stratagem ) Then I must survive ! ( He motions MARIANNE to get in front of him . She does so . Behind her back , he empties the gun of its bullets . The COLONEL 'S back is to them . SZABUNIEWICZ is helping him to a drink . ) COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Giving instructions to SZABUNIEWICZ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We take ten paces away from each other . Give me another drink . ( SZABUNIEWICZ complies . ) S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Delicately ) Colonel  --  do n't drink so much . I do n't want to fight you when you are not at your best . You 're drunk , my friend . p. 117 COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Contemptuous ) Drunk ? One bottle ? Water-drinker ! ( Tosses empty cup to SZABUNIEWICZ . ) S. L. JACOBOWSKY Before we begin  --  one technicality  --  one little technicality . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY What is this technicality ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY In my knowledge of dueling  --  gained mainly from reading novels by Schnitzler  --  I have the impression that the man who is challenged , the challengee , has the choice of weapons . Correct ? COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Correct . S. L. JACOBOWSKY Then I pick swords . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Swords ! S. L. JACOBOWSKY Swords . Sabres . Cutlasses . Anything you like . COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY ( Leans paternally on JACOBOWSKY 'S shoulder ) My good man , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut you to pieces . With pistols you have a chance . S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Weighing his gun critically ) I do n't like this gun  --  it does n't suit me. p. 118 COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Exactly same as mine . S. L. JACOBOWSKY Let me see . ( JACOBOWSKY takes the COLONEL 'S gun , fingers it , weighs it . His face lights up ) Ah ! Much better ! With this gun I feel I could work wonders ! COLONEL TADEUSZ BOLESLAV STJERBINSKY Take him . ( JACOBOWSKY gives COLONEL the gun that he has emptied and then goes back to MARIANNE . The COLONEL permits SZABUNIEWICZ to pour him another drink . ) MARIANNE ( Shielding JACOBOWSKY to give him a chance to repeat operation of emptying gun ) I wo n't let you fight . I 'll stand between you if you fight . Your bullets will pass through me . ( SZABUNIEWICZ goes up center and stands commandingly , ready to umpire the duel . ) S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( To MARIANNE with bravura audacity ) Marianne ! Stand aside ! ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Maker . May God have mercy on your soul !

SZABUNIEWICZ ( Counts ) One  --  two  --  three  --  four ( So intent are they on the combat that before they know it the Germans are upon them : A German patrol has appeared on the highway . It is led by a FIRST LIEUTENANT , accompanied by a GESTAPO MAN , who has not yet found time during the lightning advance of the Nazis to change his tourist 's garb for a uniform . He wears a green hat with shaving-brush , anklets , Tyrolean socks , shorts , bright yellow jacket . He lisps . The LIEUTENANT approaches the group of fugitives , the GESTAPO MAN behind him . ) GESTAPO OFFICIAL ( With his lisp ) Interethting thpectacle . ( To soldier ) Ditharm them . ( The two soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LIEUTENANT and the GESTAPO MAN is the blistering antagonism that the Regular Army feels for the interfering " psychological experts " who have become the Fuehrer 's pets. ) p. 120 LIEUTENANT ( Short ) What 's this duel about ? ( JACOBOWSKY looks from one to the other of the Germans and is inspired suddenly with a desperate improvisation . In dumb-show he points to the COLONEL , and makes a gesture to his forehead indicating that the COLONEL is crazy ) What ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Tapping his forehead ) An obsession , sir . GESTAPO OFFICIAL Obthethion ? What thort of obthethion ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY May I explain ? LIEUTENANT ( Pointing his gun at JACOBOWSKY ) You 'd better . S. L. JACOBOWSKY This poor man ( He points to COLONEL . ) LIEUTENANT Yes ? ( As JACOBOWSKY taps his forehead ) What 's he doing at large ? MARIANNE Papers ! Did n't you read what happened ? When I found my husband he was lying in the mud in his hospital pajamas . In the town I washed him like a baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurse him myself in the sanitarium at St. Jean de Luz .

( He starts toward STJERBINSKY , who falls back step by step , actually now with the eyes of a madman . Unable to control himself he lifts his arm to strike the German . The GESTAPO MAN whips out a gun on him . ) MARIANNE ( Screaming , intervenes  --  to GESTAPO MAN ) Do n't speak to him ! For God 's sake ! ( Embraces and pats the COLONEL , walking him away ) It 's nothing , my angel . These men wo n't hurt you . They have your welfare at heart . I 'm here with you , your Marianne . Yes , yes , I 'm right here with you . GESTAPO OFFICIAL ( Calls SZABUNIEWICZ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? SZABUNIEWICZ ( His eyes screwed up solemnly ) He do n't speak in fifteen years .

Madame wants to do that but she has no gasoline . Could you help out with a few gallons ? ( LIEUTENANT looks at GESTAPO MAN for permission . The GESTAPO MAN nods . ) LIEUTENANT Certainly . Sergeant SERGEANT ( On the highway ) Sir ! LIEUTENANT ( Goes to SERGEANT , exits as he talks , followed by two soldiers ) Get a five-gallon tin of gasoline and put it in their car . ( Disappears . We hear his voice off stage , grinding out orders . ) Right about  --  face ! Half-right through the woods for further combing out . ( The GESTAPO MAN starts to go also .

JACOBOWSKY ( Listening intently ) I hear the grass growing . SZABUNIEWICZ ( In an exalted whisper ) Saved ! Saved ! MARIANNE ( Can not contain herself any longer .

Finally he pulls himself out of it and walk down slowly to where his hat and raincoat are lying at the foot of the haystack . He bends to pick up his raincoat . Underneath the raincoat he is startled to see MARIANNE 'S hatbox . He drops the coat , picks up the hatbox , opens it , feverishly takes out MARIANNE 'S little hat and feels inside it . The papers are there ) My God , that schlemiel has forgotten his papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and runs back to the road after the automobile . But it is too late . The car has disappeared .

His face lights up . He whispers to himself ) But I 'll see you again , Marianne . I 'll see you again ! ( Meticulously he puts the hat into the hatbox . He ties up the hatbox . He picks up his raincoat and puts it over one arm . He picks up the loaf of bread and puts it under the other . Then he manages the hatbox .

He conquers it . He turns and follows down the road in the direction in which the car has disappeared. ) @x SCENE : The waterfront cafe of Papa Clairon at St. Jean de Luz ; a cramped little room feverishly lit by naked electric bulbs ; at the right a bar ; in the center a billiard table , small tables scattered about ; in the back wall two doors inscribed in large letters , " Messieurs " and " Dames . " At right a small staircase leads off stage to the street door . At left , behind the bar , a door to the private quarters of the establishment . Down right below the street door , a mechanical piano with a smoked , green-glass front that lights up and plays when a coin is put in . PAPA CLAIRON , the proprietor , a gray-haired old man , is running about , serving his guests . At the bar sits the DICE PLAYER , a grayclad gentleman , very nonchalant , drinking Pernods one after the other and absorbedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SILENT MAN , his back to the audience , his head bowed . He and the DICE PLAYER are the only ones not in motion . When the curtain goes up , everybody is dancing to the music of the mechanical piano which is playing a soft , twangy , bannjolike rendition of an old waltz . Among the guests we recognize the OLD MAN and the LITTLE BOY whom we have seen several times before . The OLD MAN is feeding the LITTLE BOY a sandwich . Down the steps from the street door comes the TRAGIC GENTLEMAN . He has with him SENATOR BRISSON , a distinguished old man with beautiful white hair and a rosy complexion . The two thread their way through the dancers to the billiard table , center . TRAGIC GENTLEMAN ( Observing the scene ) Danse Macabre ! In their homes they are lonely . Terror lurks in closets ! Here they drink . They dance . They hear the bad news . They think : " When we are together we are safe . " This is an error . It only simplifies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Affably ) What happiness to meet you , old friend , after all these years ! TRAGIC GENTLEMAN Tell me , Senator , frankly , do I look as old to you as you do to me ? SENATOR BRISSON ( Almost too sympathetic ) You do look rather tired ! TRAGIC GENTLEMAN I thought I would cure my heartache by walking . That was an illusion . Now my feet ache and my heart as well . SENATOR BRISSON You used to be good at billiards . Let 's have a game . It will distract you . TRAGIC GENTLEMAN Very well . I 'll try that too . ( They take cues , chalk them . ) DICE PLAYER ( At the bar ) Cognac , please ! PAPA CLAIRON ( Hurrying to him ) All right . All right . I have only two hands . ( As he passes the SENATOR the latter questions him . ) SENATOR BRISSON Who is that fellow at the bar ? PAPA CLAIRON ( Whispers back ) Gestapo ! p. 131 SENATOR BRISSON Ah ! ( He transmits the information to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they need Gestapo when we have so many traitors of our own ? SENATOR BRISSON I beg you not to be violent against those who only are trying to accommodate themselves to the new situation . After all we  --  you and I  --  are intellectuals . We must be detached . TRAGIC GENTLEMAN ( Humorously ) Of all traitors the intellectuals are always the most logical ! ( The SENATOR and the TRAGIC GENTLEMAN are just starting to play when JACOBOWSKY hurries in . He wears his hat , overcoat and carries MARIANNE 'S hatbox . The TRAGIC GENTLEMAN recognizes him and calls over to him ) Well , well , the Santa Claus from the establishment of Madame Bouffier ! The purveyor of marrons glaces ! What brings you to this mouse trap ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY The green cheese of hope . TRAGIC GENTLEMAN Cheese is rationed , my friend . And as for hope  --  it is  --  Monsieur Jacobowsky . ( They bow ) We were at the Sorbonne together . My friend is not only a Senator  --  he is also an intellectual . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( He looks around the cafe . ) SENATOR BRISSON ( Amiably ) Not in France , sir ! TRAGIC GENTLEMAN You are looking for someone ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY A demented man . TRAGIC GENTLEMAN Take your pick . S. L. JACOBOWSKY A demented man and a beautiful lady . ( Seated right at a table in the corner is the DANCING COUPLE , momentarily resting . They sit staring into space , not talking , rigid with liquor , stiff , ghastly , expressionless . ) TRAGIC GENTLEMAN There ! S. L. JACOBOWSKY There are many varieties , you know . I once took a course in abnormal psychology . I wanted to find out how to get along with certain relatives . ( Suddenly , out of his immobile trance , the male member of the DANCING COUPLE leaps up , makes a threatening gesture to his companion , bangs the table fiercely , then sits down abruptly ) Very interesting . Nervous type ! Spasmodic ! ( He has been eyeing the DICE PLAYER who has started to hum ) That man at the bar , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is extraordinarily calm . ( The radio breaks in  --  the voice of Marshal Petain. ) p. 133 RADIO VOICE ( With much coughing and spluttering ) And I say the nation was not equal to its task . SENATOR BRISSON ( Blissful ) Ah , Petain ! RADIO VOICE Led to the abyss by political charlatans , feeble men and ideas , France resorted only hesitantly to arms . But France , though prostrate , is not defeated . TRAGIC GENTLEMAN The arch-defeatist denies defeat . S. L. JACOBOWSKY Who is that ? SENATOR BRISSON ( Solemnly ) Our leader  --  the Marshal Petain . RADIO VOICE In the architecture of the New Europe TRAGIC GENTLEMAN Can no one silence that death rattle ? PAPA CLAIRON I can ! ( He snaps off the radio . ) SENATOR BRISSON ( To TRAGIC GENTLEMAN , gently chiding ) Be careful , my dear friend It is easy to be critical when you have n't the responsibility of power . After all , this gallant old man has to lead the nation out of our democratic chaos into the New Order . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cadence of appeasement ) You too ! SENATOR BRISSON ( With a side glance at the DICE PLAYER ) Your pessimism is unjustified , my dear friend . Things will right themselves . The German spirit is practical as well as mystical . It will unify Europe . TRAGIC GENTLEMAN ( Aware of what the SENATOR is doing ) Talk louder . Perhaps he did n't hear you . SENATOR BRISSON My old friend , you hurt my feelings . Please believe me  --  this bacillus of democracy imported from England and America  --  this infection S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Interrupting ) Excuse me , but was the French Revolution an importation ? SENATOR BRISSON May I ask , sir , are you a citizen of France ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY Unfortunately not . SENATOR BRISSON On what passport do you travel ? S. L. JACOBOWSKY I had a passport leading to nowhere but even that was confiscated by the New Order . They want to unify me out of existence . SENATOR BRISSON ( Tolerantly ) One could scarcely expect an objective opinion from a man in your position . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear Senator . I am nobody . I am a hunted man , but in this world a hunted man has one advantage . He can never be the hunter . TRAGIC GENTLEMAN But you , Senator , with a little German tuition , should make an excellent hunter . You will soon be hunting Jacobowsky . Perfect sport . No poaching laws , no penalties . SENATOR BRISSON ( To TRAGIC GENTLEMAN ) In this great convulsion of humanity what happens to Jacobowsky is none of our business . It should n't concern us ( Turns to JACOBOWSKY ) if you 'll pardon my saying so . ( JACOBOWSKY makes an absolving bow . ) TRAGIC GENTLEMAN If you 'll pardon my saying so  --  it concerns us very much . You remember when the Hitler pestilence first broke out in Germany we all of us said , " What happens to Jacobowsky is none of our business . " And when it spread from Vienna to Prague we said the same thing . " It 's none of our business . " But if instead we , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " It is our business  --  Jacobowsky is a man too . We ca n't allow human beings to be treated so "  --  in six weeks with six divisions we could have exterminated this pestidence in Germany . In other words , my dear Senator , it was we who made Hitler . We are his blitzkrieg , his victory and his world domination . Now let 's go on with the game . Your shot p. 136 SENATOR BRISSON ( Wounded , puts up his cue ) No , thank you . I prefer not to . ( The TRAGIC GENTLEMAN takes it philosophically . JACOBOWSKY goes to him . ) S. L. JACOBOWSKY My dear friend , you remember the Polish Colonel from the establishment of Madame Bouffier ? TRAGIC GENTLEMAN I remember him very well . And his man . Don Quixote and Sancho Panza . ( At this moment , when he hears JACOBOWSKY 'S reference to the Polish Colonel , the DICE PLAYER at the bar , without altering his expression or his position , puts his hands in his pockets and takes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JACOBOWSKY sees this . ) S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Eagerly ) Have you seen this Polish Colonel ? TRAGIC GENTLEMAN No , I have n't . ( JACOBOWSKY leaves the TRAGIC GENTLEMAN ; goes to the DICE PLAYER and starts importuning him with great tensity . ) S. L. JACOBOWSKY I just had a very interesting experience . I have been traveling with a Polish officer . DICE PLAYER ( Ignores him ; to PAPA CLAIRON , who is now behind the bar ) Cognac . p. 137 S. L. JACOBOWSKY ( Insists ) This Polish officer is an extraordinary fellow . We traveled together in a car requisitioned by the Polish Government in Exile DICE PLAYER Cognac . S. L. JACOBOWSKY Interesting variation . I was saying we traveled together but our journey was interrupted ( DICE PLAYER puts dice away ) Who won ? DICE PLAYER I did . S. L. JACOBOWSKY Congratulations ! Victory over yourself ! As I was saying , our journey was interrupted , but I can not understand why the Colonel is still not here . What could have happened ? Should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort should be made ? DICE PLAYER Excuse me . ( He walks away from the bar and goes into the Men 's Room . JACOBOWSKY stands alone at the bar , discouraged . At this moment the TRAGIC GENTLEMAN has come to the table near the bar where the SILENT MAN is sitting . The TRAGIC GENTLEMAN looks at him , curious . ) TRAGIC GENTLEMAN My friend here is so exhausted he sleeps sitting up . ( Looks more closely ) Sleeps ? ( The TRAGIC GENTLEMAN steps closer to the table and shakes the sleeping man by the shoulder . The sleeping man 's elbows go out from under his chin and his face slides along the table ; he has been dead for some time , an empty pillbox clenched in his fist . Everyone crowds around the table . One of the patrons overturns a chair in his haste . JACOBOWSKY turns to the table , deeply moved . CLAIRON pushes his way forward. ) p. 138 PAPA CLAIRON What 's happened ? He 's dead . What 's this ? ( He takes pills from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some pills . Montaigne says S. L. JACOBOWSKY Regardless of what Montaigne says , when you have a bad headache you take headache pills . Poor fellow . ( He takes the pills from PAPA CLAIRON 'S hands and puts them in his pocket  --  almost enviously ) At any rate these pills gave him peace . ( A slatternly , gray-haired woman pokes her head in from the street door . She shouts a warning . ) TOWN WOMAN They 're coming in a truck . It 's a raid ! A raid ! TRAGIC GENTLEMAN They 're taking hostages . ( He starts to run out , stops as he sees the Nazis in the street ) Too late . They 're here . S. L. JACOBOWSKY Excuse me , excuse me ( He makes his way through the crowd and walks through the door marked " Dames . " ) CHILD ( Cries , terrified ) Grandpa ! OLD MAN It 's all right , Robert ! ( Down the stairs the COMMISSAIRE SPECIALE DE POLICE , a fat embarrassed man with a perspiring face , enters ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first .

If your papers are in order you have nothing to fear . Come along  --  the quicker , the better . One after another ! ( The lisping GESTAPO MAN and the LIEUTENANT we have seen before come in with two Nazi soldiers . The GESTAPO MAN is now in the superb uniform of his order . He goes to the head of the billiard table and stands watching critically everything that goes on , allowing the LIEUTENANT to execute the details of the raid . The DICE PLAYER comes back nonchalantly from the Men 's Room and walks back to his old place at the bar , calmly removing his gray gloves as he does so . The GESTAPO MAN watches him carefully . ) COMISSAIRE Well , what are you waiting for ? Go ahead ! ( The arrests begin . Everybody is herded to the street door . One French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LITTLE BOY . ) OLD MAN You ca n't take me . He has no one but me . COMISSAIRE ( To the German , helplessly ) He says he has no one but him . p. 140 LIEUTENANT If he can prove he 's clear of this dirty sabotage he can come back to him . This dirty sabotage has got to stop and we 'll stop it . ( The OLD MAN is led off  --  the LITTLE BOY stands alone , his face in his hands . TRAGIC GENTLEMAN goes to the LITTLE BOY , holds him tenderly . ) CHILD ( Mumbles ) Grandpa ! Grandpa ! Grandpa ! COMISSAIRE ( To LITTLE BOY ) It 's all right . It 's all right . TRAGIC GENTLEMAN ( Holding child ) You swine . ( The TRAGIC GENTLEMAN stares at the collaborationist COMMISSAIRE , so angry he is unable to speak . The LIEUTENANT moves on to the DANCING COUPLE and orders them out . ) LIEUTENANT ( Pushing the TRAGIC GENTLEMAN up to the street door ) You 're next for a haircut . Take him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is back of the bar . To COMMISSAIRE ) What about this fellow ? COMISSAIRE I can vouch for him . Very respected innkeeper . LIEUTENANT Many of these respected innkeepers are hospitable to our enemies . ( Comes to DICE PLAYER who goes on playing without looking up ) And who is this so concentrated gambler ? p. 141 COMISSAIRE ( Pleadingly to DICE PLAYER ) Please do n't make difficulties , Monsieur . ( Without looking up from his game , the DICE PLAYER puts his passport on the bar .
