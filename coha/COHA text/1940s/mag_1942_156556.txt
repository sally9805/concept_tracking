Akron-world 's largest rubber manufacturing center and the very core of the U.S. war effort-last week produced at 15% below capacity despite a five-year backlog of munitions orders . Instead of the patriotic hustle &; bustle which throbs in most defense-plant towns , Akron was a gigantic time bomb , relentlessly , awesomely ticking . Over the place hung a pall of suspicion , bitterness , hatred . Management and labor wrangled , sparred and fought . Root of the trouble is the six-hour day started by management during the depression , now grimly held by the union as a labor " asset . " <P> Old Stuff . Trouble in Akron is nothing new . In 1902 the A.F. of L. started organizing , finally bashed its head against a united front of the manufacturers . Then came a long series of organizing drives , unrest , strikes , riots . In 1936 labor won its first big victory when the upstart United Rubber Workers ( C.I.O. ) forced giant Goodyear Tire &; Rubber to rehire 70 discharged workers . The U.R.W. signed members in wholesale lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers . Many of them are husky , fearless men from the hills of Kentucky , Tennessee and West Virginia with a background of poverty , moonshining , revenooers . <P> Boss of this crowd is tall , swarthy Sherman Harrison Dalrymple who has been in the middle of Akron 's rubber mess ever since 1919 , is now the president of the powerful U.R.W. Once a rubber worker himself , Boss Dalrymple knows it is tough , hot , backbreaking work . So he wants his members to work less and earn more . <P> Dalrymple 's method is the six-hour day and a strict quota system which forces every member to work at the same speed . Thus while every factory pays piece rates , practically all banding department men earn $7.92 a day , all truck tire builders $8.90 a day . The men could earn more by turning out more units . But when one company wanted to boost the daily stint to 169 tire bands per man per day the union squashed it to 143 per day . Reason : a few men might not make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Stuff . In effect a city wide slowdown system , this form of economic suicide went on without causing trouble until Pearl Harbor . Then things changed . Akron rubber manufacturers , deluged with $1 billion in orders , were suddenly faced with their biggest job ever ( TIME , Feb. 2 ) . So they started hiring thousands of men . In no time at all Akron 's unemployment fell to 6,000 men , of whom fewer than 1,000 had any rubber manufacturing experience at all . To ease the pinch , manufacturers put women to work on barrage balloons , life rafts , similar items ; Goodyear and Firestone established training schools for tire builders . <P> This was not enough . The companies went to Dalrymple , finally persuaded him to put some workers on an eight-hour day . But last week over 75% of Akron 's rubber workers were still on a six-hour day . Even the union admits that per man output has not increased since Pearl Harbor .                 @ @ @ @
