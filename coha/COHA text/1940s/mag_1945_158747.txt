Into the White House last week , fresh from his hurry-up trip to the Philippines ( TIME , June 11 ) , rushed Maryland 's lean Senator Millard Tydings . With him , he brought a program for those unhappy islands : <P> The U.S. promise of independence ( by July 4 , 1946 ) should be fulfilled . <P> A gift of $100 million , to be spent by Army &; Navy engineers on reconstruction and rehabilitation should be made . <P> The near-bankrupt Commonwealth should have easy access to Government loans , to tide it over the next two or three difficult years . <P> A low-tariff trade policy should be instituted for the next three , possibly five years , to be followed by gradual tariff increases . <P> Harry Truman said he would recommend the Tydings program for passage by Congress .
