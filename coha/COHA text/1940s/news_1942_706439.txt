txt LARGEST A. E. SAFELY OVER THERE CONVOY IS LARGEST First Armored Forces of Our Army Land in British Isles MANY THOUSANDS IN BODY , Days Required to Put Them All Ashore -- LSecond Front Speculation Stimulated By ROBERT P. POST Wireless to Two Now TORS TIMES . SOMEWHERE IN NORTHERN IRELAND , May ** several days now United States troops ? the biggest contingent yet to come over in a single movement  --  have been pouring into these islands by the thousands . And for the first time in this war they have brought their own tanks . Sergeant Charles Burns of Woodhaven , N. Y. , was the first man to drive a United States tank as part of a United States operation on British soil . He climbed into the driver 's seat of a United States light tank just after a derrick had dropped it on a Northern Irish pier . After a little preliminary fiddling the tank 's engine roared into life and the tank moved off to head a long line that formed behind it as one after another of the first armored vehicles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were swung from the hold of the ship . Although the convoy , which sailed from an Eastern United States port , was the biggest that has yet reached Ireland , the number of troops or tanks that arrived can not be disclosed . Second Front Speculation Of course , the arrival of United States troops is bound to cause renewed speculation here as to the opening of a so-called second front by British and United States forces in the near future . Naturally , the decision is one of the highest military policy and when it is taken it will be kept completely ? secret . Any discussion must remain pure speculation . However , it does not require any military genius to deduce that the continued arrival of United States troops and now of their armored vehicles in Northern Ireland may release British divisions there for service elsewhere . The British have got good troops in Ulster , many of them Dunkerque veterans , and they are finishing up a period of intensive training . By now they should be about ready to go anywhere . On the ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was General Vivian H. B. Majendie , commanding the Northern Irish District , who watched with a smile on his face . And even as the tanks began to land , the sheds near the docks echoed the bark of orders and the tramp of hobnailed boots as man after man swung over the // BIGGEST U. S. CONVOY REACHES IRELAND // gangways with their big blue bags on their backs . These were piled into British trucks and then the men assembled in full fighting kit . In small detachments they marched out to where other trucks were drawn up to transport them to camp , Like Part of America Incidentally , with the arrival of these troops Northern Ireland is beginning to look like the United States . One sees United States uniforms all over the countryside hnd in towns and cities the streets are full of United States trucks , jeeps and command cars . The convoy route and the time of it were kept secret . It , had a naval escort provided by both British and United States Navies . Naturally , censors do not allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it contained some ships that once plied the same seas on a happier mission . The entire movement apparently was carried out with the most effective secrecy without loss . At this end the dangerous docking operation  --  dangerous because of possible attack by the German Air Force  --  was carried out with a speed and precision that left some British observers amazed . The only pos " ble exception to I this statement was in connection with the unloading of tanks , which union rules demanded must be done by civilian stevedores . Hence the spectacle of a few men working on tanks unloading them , with at least 100 able-bodied soldiers standing by unable even to help swing one tank ashore .
