It was a moment that thousands of U.S. moppets would long remember . Jack Armstrong , the All-American Boy , * had just leaped , with suitable sound effects , from a plane . The hero wore a suit of armor and two parachutes . But one chute failed to open . Then it developed that something was wrong with the other chute , too . Jack plunged earthward . . . . <P> By that time it was 6:44 p.m. , E.D.T. and the announcer broke in with the standard cliffhanger : tune in tomorrow and hear what happened . Next day , listeners learned that Jack had survived : he had taken the unusual precaution of packing a third parachute , which he whipped out just in time for a safe landing . <P> But there was still another ending to the episode . Comfortable , florid ABC Vice President Ed Borroff was among the listeners that day . A longtime critic of such programs , he decided that the cliff-hang ending had gone quite far enough . Last week Borroff gave orders which may chip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as kid-chillers . Jack Armstrong and his running mate , Sky King , he ruled , need more time , less suspense . After Aug. 25 the shows will be heard on alternate days and stretched to a full half hour . Each day there will be a complete episode-and no more cliff-hangs . <P> <P> * Who a fortnight ago began his 16th year on the air .
