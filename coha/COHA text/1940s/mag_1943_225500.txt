It certainly was a hell of a way to run a railroad , with German tanks pumping shells at your locomotives from ranges as close as 150 yards , and demolition charges double-crossing your bridges before you could come to them . <P> But Brigadier General Carl Gray 's special American-British railway corps stayed on the job all through the North Africa fighting . It moved up with the front-line troops and performed a series of minor miracles to keep the vital rail supply lines open . This week the corps had virtually every foot of the 1,200-mile North African railway system back in apple-pie order and running on schedule . <P> During the main Tunisian fighting the Allies controlled only 200 miles of the system . Another 200 was in the actual battle areas , while the remaining 800 miles served the Axis and had to be recaptured mile by mile . Some sections of the line were put back into operation within two hours after the last enemy had been driven back ; others required ten days . Prize exploit for Gray 's men was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bits . <P> When Mateur was taken , the railroad gang found an isolated spur leading to Tabarka , and rounded up a pathetic collection of rolling stock , including one locomotive , 19 cars , one Diesel car and a motor truck with flanged wheels to run on the rails . In a few hours this spur was converted into a miniature local system , hauling 300 tons of supplies daily . <P> When Allied troops suffered temporary setbacks , the railway corpsmen had to scramble to save their own rolling stock . German troops were approaching Gafsa when a detail dashed into town in a truck , got up steam and dashed to safety with 13 locomotives and many cars . Enemy tank patrols potted away at the last trains from close range , but could not halt them . <P> General Gray and his men are railroaders all , in the Army to do this very ' job . Before the war Gray was executive vice president of Chicago &; North Western Railway ; - now he is director general of Military Railway Services in North Africa . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under them average five . Most of his corps of 6,500 are Americans , but some British construction experts are included . The British have portable bridging material that fits together as neatly as a youngster 's Meccano set , and made it possible for them to repair seven thoroughly damaged bridges on the Kasserine-Sousse line in ten ! days flat .
