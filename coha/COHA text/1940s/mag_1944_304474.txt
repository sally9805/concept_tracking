Canada last week stepped up front as one of the world 's creditor nations . She invited overseas customers to step up and place their postwar orders . Parliament quickly approved a bill to provide $300,000,000 in cash or credit to finance foreign purchases of Canadian goods , another $50,000,000 to insure exporters against foreign-trade risks . This was as if the U.S. Congress had appropriated $5 billion in credits for U.S. overseas customers . <P> The purpose of the Canadian bill was to keep Canadian trade moving in the next three years when economic dislocation is likely to be greatest . Canada 's war-booming industries , her own version of Lend-Lease ( $800,000,000-a-year Mutual Aid program ) have swelled Canadian exports to third among the world 's trading nations . But four-fifths of this trade is in war supplies . War Creditor Canada has a heavy stake in remaining a peacetime exporter and a world trader . <P> Thus Canada figures it is enlightened self-interest to be among the first to subscribe heavily to UNRRA , to commit herself at the Bretton Woods conference to a $625,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The new bill provides the incentive for Canadian traders to seek new business where demand is likely to be heavy , even if immediate capacity to pay is limited . If a deal is too big for private business to handle , Creditor Canada stands ready to provide the credit for countries which want and need Canadian goods . <P> First in the line already forming at Ottawa for these postwar credits is the Soviet Union , whose record as a commercial risk is excellent . Russia has already reportedly left specifications for postwar orders with Canadian manufacturers ( TIME , June 5 ) .
