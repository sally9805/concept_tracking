txt Suggested for Tire Owners Instead of having every excess tire owner told that he must have actually turned in these tires by a certain date , thereby causing people to stand in line and incidentally resulting in a jam at the American Railway Express office , why not let the tire owner list his tires on a penny.postcard and mail the card to the local express office ? The express office could then mail out a government-stamped card directing the tire owner . to deliver his tires on specified dates , spaced to avoid a one-day deadline for all persons . The card which is sent out from the express office could serve as evidence that the individual has complied with the OPA orders and therefore is eligible to purchase gasoline . FREDERICK B. HARRIS . Pine Orchard , Conn. , Dec. 3 , 1942.
