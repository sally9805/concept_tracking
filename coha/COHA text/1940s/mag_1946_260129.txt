The clapboard torture house , built by the Japs on the campus of Shanghai American School , was gone ; its victims ' screams no longer echoed down Avenue Ptain in the city 's old French quarter . But over the Georgian school buildings flew a motheaten U.S. flag ; S.A.S. was in session again . <P> Since 1912 , when Protestant missionaries founded S.A.S. , it has been the main home for China-based American schoolkids . There businessmen , missionaries , military and Government personnel knew that their boys &; girls would somehow capture the sense of belonging to a U.S. that many of them might not see for years . By June , 1941 , when the Government ordered most U.S. nationals home , S.A.S. was educating 500 to 600 American youngsters a year , putting 35 to 50 of them into U.S. colleges . Almost everything about S.A.S. was American , from its sentimental school song ( " Fair is the name we love . . . " ) to its menus ( Chinese dishes only twice a week ) . Native instructors taught Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red Schoolhouse . On S.A.S. 's 15 willow-shaded acres , with its two gyms and the only quarter-mile track in Shanghai , American boys learned to excel at American sports . <P> Last week S.A.S. began a new term and a new life , under a new principal . The job of restoring S.A.S to its prewar heights had fallen to Peking-born Thomas C. Gibb , 36 , son and grandson of U.S. missionaries , who taught English there before Pearl Harbor , has since been the acting dean of Haverford College . Finding a student body is the least of Gibb 's worries . His worst headaches : locating books , desks and beds in supply-shy China ; drumming up a faculty .
