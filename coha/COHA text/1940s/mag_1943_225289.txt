Back from his entertainment tour of the South Pacific military bases , gape-grinned Film Comedian Joe E. Brown had covered 32,000 miles , had seen more war front than most U.S. soldiers . He had ripped through comedy routines before 8 a.m. and hours after dark . One show he did in Papuan jungle grass up to his hips , six minutes ' march from Jap positions ; another went on in a driving downpour at Milne Bay , New Guinea . <P> Brown had undertaken the tour at his own expense , in part as a memorial to his son , Captain Don Brown , killed in a California bomber crash last October ; he could feel the satisfaction of a job well done . <P> Yet for all the excitement and adventure and the recollections of applause , Funnyman Brown was not in a funny mood . <P> He was too impressed with the hardships of soldiering and the meagerness of existence out on the fringes of the war ; too depressed by the seeming indifference of civilians who wrongly assumed that the troops had plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown reported them : some American boys have n't seen a movie since they landed out there ; soldiers in rear areas see films occasionally , but the Pacific area needs at least 50 projectors right now ; about 1% of the men hear radio programs . <P> During his entire twelve-week trip Brown heard only two broadcasts of Command Performance , the special 30-minute program which fills soldier requests for anything from a violin solo to the bark of a pet dog . Worst hindrances are lack of equipment and delays in transportation ; one transcription record that arrived a few weeks ago turned out to be a cheery Christmas program . <P> Brown 's report might startle smug civilians ; it certainly came as no surprise to the Army 's hard-pressed Special Services Division . With morale equipment , as with every other kind of Army equipment , the basic problem is a heartbreaking one : how to get it there . Considering the Army as a whole , U.S. forces are as well equipped for the fighting man 's off-duty relaxation in rear areas as any army in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be shown ; performances are often so crowded that some men sit behind the screen to watch the picture in reverse . Records played over loudspeakers enliven some camps ; in New Guinea , moreover , this music has become a favorite thrill to the boongs , fuzzy-haired native boys who work at advanced air strips . Live shows are favorites everywhere . New Guinea now has a show attraction called Hellzapapuan , while stars like Martha Raye and Carole Landis have performed in advanced zones in North Africa . <P> The Army is now rushing construction and delivery of a compact entertainment package , the B-kit , containing a seven tube radio and record player , mechanical phonograph , records , transcriptions , song books and six harmonicas . Sidelight on radio tastes : soldiers in the South Pacific who hear radios prefer BBC news to the " too optimistic " newscast from KGEI , San Francisco . <P> Final decisions on the forwarding of morale equipment must and do rest with the commanding generals and their divisional commanders . When MacArthur thinks his men need B-kits more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long enough to speed a couple of hundred B-kits through . When Eisenhower has received 200 pursuit pilots and decides his forces need Martha Raye more than the 201st , Martha Raye they get .
