White House orders for a 2,000,000-ton shipping pool for aid to Britain last week ( see p. 15 ) caught U.S. ship lines in the midst of their busiest , most harassed period in history . On all the seven seas except the North Atlantic , U.S. shipping has tried to take over from the flagging British the great task of moving the bulk of the world 's freight . Before war began the U.S. overseas fleet ( then 1,749,689 active tons , 87% over age ) often ran almost empty on its Government subsidies , carried only around 30% of the nation 's foreign trade . But by last week almost all of Britain 's big merchant marine had been withdrawn for war duty , and the U.S. fleet was puffing and panting with the hopeless task of carrying as many as possible of the cargoes the British used to move . <P> Exclusive of coasters in China and India , Britain still has about 60 vessels of 600,000 tons outside of war duty , but even these 60 are being used only to transport essential foodstuffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or occasionally a load of food to England . For all practical purposes , the British merchant marine is no longer a competitor for the world 's seaborne freight . Gone from their normal trade routes are the ten British ships formerly operated between North and South America , the 25 operated from the U.S. Atlantic Coast to the Far East , countless others . Most of the Free Dutch and Norwegian ships are also in war service in the North Atlantic . <P> Where British vessels have been withdrawn , U.S. ships have moved in . Vessels withdrawn from European and Mediterranean trade under the Neutrality Act of 1939 are being used to up tonnage on other routes 50% to 700% , and old ships have been called back into service . In March of 1939 only 17 U.S. ships sailed to Africa ; now there are 51 . Ships going to the Far East have increased in number from twelve to 82 , to India from twelve to 25 ( see chart ) . Sailing totals have increased even more . Examples : Robin Line and American South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year ; American Export has 54 sailings to India against nine ; American President Lines has increased round-the-world sailings from 26 to 39 . <P> Not since before the Civil War has the U.S. been such a factor on the world 's ocean trade routes . Thanks to Hog Island 's mass production of freighters , the U.S. hoped to become a seafaring nation after World War I , but lost standing quickly in the 1920s to nations whose young men took to sea as naturally as young Americans took to automobiles : England , Denmark , Norway , The Netherlands . Despite subsidies totaling $3,500,000,000 in the last quarter century , U.S. ship lines-with wages and operating costs higher than their foreign competitors-rarely made money .
