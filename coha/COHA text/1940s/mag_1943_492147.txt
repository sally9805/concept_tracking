Washington Operator By EARL WILSON WASHINGTON telephone operators are probably the most cussed and applauded in the country ; the cussing resulting from the unprecedented wire congestion , the applause a tribute to their almost fiendish efficiency : for they complete 96 per cent of the daily avalanche of calls within ten minutes and will get you South America in fifteen minutes . Sometimes it seems that the owners of those cool , anonymous voices on the Washington long-distance switchboards of the Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company must be the most harassed of all today 's workaday war heroines . If so , it does n't upset them . Sunk in the greatest flood of calla on record , they pamper high and low officialdom , and exercise a benevolent despotism over the long lines in and out of the capital . Calmly they take lints from one armed service and give them to another , and with equal composure call Africa or Australia . Having been carefully investigated and fingerprinted , they get Mr. Churchill for Mr. Roosevelt , steer millions of words to ports of embarkation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many operators in other cities do equally good jobs , but Washington is the war capital of the United Nations , so let us watch Washington Long Distance Operator 167 during a fairly hard day . Operator 167 is Miss Grace Halderson , twenty-seven , originally of Valders , Wisconsin , but later of Chicago , tall and blond , like a Billy Rose show girl , and glossy , like a John Powers model . Four days after Pearl Harbor she volunteered to leave her Chicago switchboard for Washington to help handle a 200 per cent increase in toll calls . One of some 300 girls borrowed from other cities , she sits in a Washington hot seat , known as the " sequence position . " She 'll show you what that means . It is nine A.M. and an ever-loudening babble arises from the dozens of chattering girls in the big operating room as Miss Halderson fidgets on a tall seat before her switchboard , waiting for some excitement . A head-set rocks lightly on her page-boy hair-do . Her lips brush the lean , graceful transmitter whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nest of six girls handles nearly all calls from the White House private-branch exchange . Custodians of President Roosevelt 's long-distance voice , they might seem , to starry-eyed romantics , to be especially favored , but Miss Halderson does not flick an eyelid at them . Waiting half restlessly for the sequences to begin , she suddenly plugged in under a flash of light on her board . From a booth a woman sobbed that her sister was dying . She wanted to call her sister 's husband , a soldier stationed in Florida . Miss Halderson seized a plug and stabbed the little hole marked ATLANTA . She got the zip-zip go-ahead signal . Then she told the Atlanta operator of the crisis . Atlanta replied that this particular camp had no circuits for enlisted men , only for official Army business . " But , operator ! " She repeated the story with such feeling that Atlanta quickly got the commanding officer of the camp on the wire . " I 'll have the man on a plane inside of an hour , " he promised . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratitude , exclaimed , " Operator , I want to show my appreciation . What 's your name ? " Instantly Miss Halderson 's voice became impersonal . " I 'm sorry , " she replied . " We 're not permitted to give out that information . " Thus , in the best Bell System tradition , she had remained just a voice . " That 's drilled into us  --  that and the necessity for secrecy concerning calls , " Miss Halderson whispered . Presently her switchboard came to life again . An operator elsewhere in the big room trunked into her board and told her to pick up the Navy line on Jack 203 . The jack is the small hole that 's plugged in . As she sat gingerly there before her board , her eyes were on tiny light bulbs that would flicker to tell her who was calling . Under the bulbs were small labels that read U. S. CAPITOL , FBI , NWA ( National War Agencies ) , Bowhic FIELD , WAR DEPT. and NAVY Derr . Within her thirty-two-inch reach there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hint of the Arctic Circle in her voice . A moment later . Miss Halderson brightened , for she was ready to resume the Navy 's sequence . She said , with satisfaction , " I 've got Indianapolis for him . " He was n't there to take it . He had stepped out . Nobody seemed to know where he had gone or when he would be back . In this moment of his great unpopularity with her , she saw that she would also have been able to get Cleveland for him  --  he had placed eight calls there  --  and Chicago too . " Well ! " she said , smiling meagerly . She left word for him to call . His voice was sarcastic when he called twenty minutes later . " Operator , " he said , " have n't you been able to get at least one of those calls through ? " Miss Halderson is a genteel person . A frustrated concert pianist , she holds teacher 's and graduate 's degrees from the Mendelssohn Conservatory of Music in Chicago . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nevertheless managed to reply , " I am sorry . Mr. , I would have been able to get several calls through , but you were out . " " Put ' em on now ! " " I am sorry , sir , but all the circuits are busy again . " You could almost see him trying to tear his hair out by the roots . Aside , she whispered , " It 's in great temptation , at times like this , to tell him off , but you just do n't do it . " He became understandably humble after he had thought it over for a minute . Presently , she got Indianapolis for him again , and then it was zip-zip-zip . She got him Chicago , St. Louis , Cleveland , Kansas City , in lightning fashion . As soon as he finished one call , there was another coming in . He had n't time to leave his desk between conversations . " If I let him leave it , I 'm lost , " she said . Between the sequence calls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the little light pop on , she plugged in instantly , remarking with restrained excitement , " These calls have to go through ! " Because of the constant possibility of a sneak air raid on Washington , these calls are of the greatest urgency . An air-raid spotter , possibly at some post within sight of I he Capitol dome , was reporting a plane passing over . He had said " Army flash ! " to his operator , adding his number , and Miss Halderson had swiftly connected him with the filter center . There officers , carefully checked the report of this routine flight , just to make sure it was routine . Miss Halderson 's first fifteen-minute relief period had arrived . She gets two day . Because the recess time seems to pass with unspeakable speed , she fairly whooshed out to the women 's lounge . Some of the operators were dancing to radio music . Others were reading in easy chairs . One was sprawled on a couch . Miss Haldersun waved to one of the native Washington operators , Mrs. Ardella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young and attractive blonde , the wife of a sailor . They settled down at a table in the cafeteria and had tea . " I had that gabby woman again last night when things were sort of quiet , " Mrs. Dike said . " The one that 's always telling me about her boy who went in the Air Corps some time back . She was calling him because she felt so blue . She asked me if 1 remembered when she called him the first night in camp . Of course I did n't , but I said I did . She said the other boys kidded him , and he got so annoyed ! Last night she said she got the nicest letters from him . She said she told her husband , ' Look here ; it looks to me like that boy 's flying ! " Well , ' says her husband , ' what d' you think he 'd be doing in the Air Corps  --  going by kiddie car ? ? Miss Halderson agreed that it was curious about how people like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called long distance on Christmas Day and asked how long she should cook a turkey . The operators pooled their information and told her . A soldier called long distance from a phone booth and said he was just lonesome , and would somebody talk to him ? Noon also came and went . Miss Halderson , who believes in eating well , had downed a lunch of meat and potatoes . Then she had gone for a walk . Shortly after she returned , Navy signaled violently . Would she put that Seattle call ahead in the sequence ? It was quite important . She frowned . The traffic situation to Seattle did n't look good . It might be an hour before she could get through . The police meanwhile interrupted . They were looking for a salesman whose wife had been injured in an auto accident . He was believed to be in Pennsylvania . Miss Halderson phoned five cities and twenty-eight telephones . She found him in a very happy frame of mind  --  in a bar . " This traffic is getting heavier and heavier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bookkeeping problem . While she continued trying to get through to Seattle , Miss Halderson was suddenly given an overseas call by the War Department . To outsiders , this might be highly dramatic . Miss Halderson merely said , " 1 trunk this down to the internationnl position . " Calling Seattle As prosaically as that , she relayed it to the Washington overseas operator , who , in turn , shot it along to the New York overseas operator . Then it underwent a miraculous change . Miss Halderson had no part in this miracle , except that she originated the call . As the words left a point on the East Coast , shot into the air and alined out across the Atlantic . they were scrambled . They were split up into bits , distorted beyond understanding , flung into a crazy patchwork more jumbled than double-talk . " It 's all done by the engineers , and the operators do n't even try to understand it , " Miss Halderson sighed . But the call to Seattle was still in Miss Halderson 's hair . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raid . " You make cells for President Roosevelt , and Wendell Willkie , and a lot of senators , and Sonja Henie , and Tito Schipa , " she continued , " but when you 've got a call to be made to a Seattle steel company and ca n't get through , that 's the one you want to put up more than any other . " Her ordinary route to Seattle would be through Chicago and Portland , Oregon . An alternate , or detour , route would be north to New York , then west to Portland . Miss Halderson found both routes choked . " There 's nothing anyplace like this Washington and New York traffic , " she said . All the 300 circuits between the two cities were in use , although two years ago 135 circuits had seemed quite enough . Special strategies had been devised to speed up the New York calls . Five circuits from New York had been set aside for Government business . New York had also installed direct connections to the War Department . Thus it bypassed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , New York saved , perhaps , a half minute of precious circuit time and made it available for somebody else . Gradually , Miss Haldeman whittled down those other sequence calls until she had only eight remaining . Like a halfback , she kept trying to pierce that pile-up west of Chicago . She was literally badgering the Chicago operators to let her through . " O.K. , Washington ! " the Chicago operator finally said , and off she went . Miss Halderson never gave a thought to what was happening . But actually her voice was traveling underground and overhead , through streams and snows , past farms and small towns , into the thick of the biggest cities . It winged first from Washington to Baltimore to Harrisburg to Pittsburgh , then it leaped across Ohio to Cleveland and Toledo . It hopped to Chicago , raced from there to Davenport , Iowa City and Des Moines , then sped to Omaha , to Denver , and then made a long jump to Salt Lake City . From there , it zipped away up to Portland . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new strength by repeater stations along the way . It arrived , a very lusty commodity , in Portland , and the Portland operator shot it at once to Seattle . It all took less than sixty seconds . The Seattle steel company was instantly on the wire . Then two secretaries a continent away from each other , one in Washington , one in Seattle , began the familiar duel that all operators deplore . " You put your party on first ! " said one . watchful of her employer 's time . " No , you put your party on first ! " Apparently , this would go on for the duration . Miss Halderson firmly interceded . She said that Washington was making the call and it was Seattle 's duty to receive it . Seattle gave in . The man from the Navy got on . " Swell , operator ! " he said . Miss Halderson closed the key and sat back , permitting herself some elation . But in the midst of her rejoicing there was a flash from the War Department . Somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 call , and she would have to take the line away from the Navy . This might be difficult . Wrong Private Operators have had Priority 1 to worry about only since November first . To make it easy to clear all wires in case of an attack on our shores or any other emergency , the Board of War Communications gave Priority 1 calls precedence aver all others . It classified as Priority 1 calls those containing " extremely urgent orders to armed forces " or those relating to " immediate dangers due to the presence of the enemy . " It ruled that calls concerning hurricanes , floods or earthquakes materially affecting the war effort could also be classified as Priority 1 . Wrathy as the Navy might become at losing the Seattle circuit , Miss Halderson hnd no choice in the matter . Her supervisor came and stood behind her . " We have a very urgent Priority One call and we must have this line , " she told the Navy , breaking in . " Will you hang up , please , and make your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navy . The crisis was only fleeting . For the Navy man understood better than most the value of having priority classifications and hung up . Five minutes later Miss Halderson called him back with his Seattle party . It was close to five P.m. when he finished . Now he was in good humor . All but two of his calls had been completed . They could be made the next day . " Thank you , operator , " he said cheerfully . " We 've both done a good day 's work . Good night . " But it was n't good night for her , For the calls to and from soldiers were beginning . There is is great flood of them around five o'clock . And the job of finding Pvt . Johnny Doughboy in some camp with very meager information is one of the hardest that operators have today . Miss Halderson got one suchcall from a girl whose voice was pure Scarlett O'Hara . She wanted Private X at Fort Meade , Maryland . After trying six extensions , 11'lias Halderson found Private X @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said she had made a mistake . It was another admirer , Private J , who was at Fort Meade . Would she get him ? Miss Halderson by now had lost the circuit , because of the error . Recovering it , she found the soldier was at mess . She left word for him to call from a pay station . As there was a line waiting , forty minutes passed before he finally came on the wire . Scarlett , who had stayed on the line . was at this precise moment heard muttering to somebody at her side , " These stupid , lazy , old operators . " Miss Halderson felt that capped the day . Her eight hours were finished . Aa
