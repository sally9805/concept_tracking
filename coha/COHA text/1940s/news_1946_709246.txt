Thus , New York Harbor is facec with a paralyzing tie-up that wil see only troopships , railroad-ownec tugs and barges and a few boat ; owned by two oil companies mov ing after midnight tonight . As wa ; forecast earlier in the week by officials of Local 333 , United Marin ( Division , International Longshoremen 's Association , AFL , virtually everything that is transported by boat will cease to move .

After the meeting the Mayor explained that he did not want to alarm the public , but he felt that a " rigid priority " system for the distribution of fuel should be established in the event of a strike . He estimated that 80 per cent of the city 's coal and other fuel and nearly half of its food would be cut off by the walkout . The transportation system is not too badly off , he said , with about a week 's supply , of coal , and other departments have a week 's supply of oil and their position on coal is good . He reported that otherwise // the situation was " quite bad , " with probably not more than one day 's supply in the city yards . A great deal of coal could be run in by trucks , the Mayor pointed out , adding that some coal cars arriving in New Jersey might be diverted to unloading points in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad tugs were not scheduled to walk out may be helpful . Mayor O'Dwyer said the strike would make it impossible for the city to tow its garbage-laden barges to sea . He said , however , that if they were able to find a new place for disposal purposes , the Department of Marine and Aviation , which owns two small tugs , might be of some aid . The Mayor said the conference had divided the city into three public services , education , transportation and a group that included the Departments of Health , Sanitation and Public Buildings . The Education Department , he said , had about a week 's supply each of coal and oil on hand , based on the report of Mary E. Dillon , president of the Board of Educa , - tion , who said that only 8 per cent of the schools used oil for fuel and of those only 10 per cent had less than a two-week supply on hand . " We are not too much concerned at the moment , nor for about a week , " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this situation will become more serious daily as the limited supply of coal and oil dwindles . We must get fuel into the city . We ca n't compromise on the health of our people . The administration is preparing a ' blueprint ' against an extended emergency . " The union 's demands for a fortyhour week ; an increase in hourly wages for deckhands , cooks and firemen ( unlicensed personnel ) to $1.35 ; $1.83 an hour for captains , $1.78 for pilots and engineers and $1.57 for mates , and the retroactivity of all increases to Dec. 31 , the expiration date of the old contract , have been turned down by the operators , who in turn have offered rises of 5 cents and 10 cents an hour . These were rejected by the union . Edward C. Maguire , Mayor O'Dwyer 's labor adviser , explained TO MEET TUG STRIU Wage Adjustment Committee c the Harbor Carriers of the ? Poi of New York and the Wage Scale Committee of the union . He- declined to divul the methods he would ' use to approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men back on , their tugs . United States Conciliation Commissioner William C. Liner , who has steadfastly refused to give up hope that a crippling strike could be averted , also will address future moves toward making the work stoppage as short as possible . Officials of the union had no developments to report late yesterday ' afternoon . They were not ' too optimistic - about the outcome ? of tomorrow 's meeting , and could add only : " We 'll wait and see . " James P. , chairman of the operators ' committee , : emphasized that his group stood ready to reopen negotiations whenever the union would send a committee empowered to act . An official of the Moore-McCormick Lines , operators of the transport Argentina , " bride ship " due to dock here tomorrow morning , reported yesterday afternoon that it had been advised that the use of its docking master to direct the berthing of the vessel would make it a " hot ship . " The official said that while Army tugs were available , they would be useless without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the union disavowed any knowledge of such a statement , adding that the organization 's leaders had expressed a willingness to permit free movement of troopships using Government tugs .
