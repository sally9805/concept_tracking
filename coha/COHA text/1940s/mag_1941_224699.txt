Next to a good reliable ghost , a Family Curse is one of the most hallowed appurtenances of British nobility . Last week a fine old Family Curse made a fine news story . Twenty-year-old Viscount Lambton , son and heir of the 5th Earl of Durham , lay dead by " suicide while of unsound mind , " according to a coroner 's jury . The folk of Northumberland knew that the Curse of the Worm had struck again . <P> The Worm of Lambton was fished out of the River Wear at the time of the Crusades by Sir John Lambton , angling godlessly on Sunday . Uncommonly ugly and uncommonly strong , the Worm escaped from the well into which he threw it and grew so huge that it would wrap itself many times around a nearby hill . It devastated the countryside and when cut into pieces reunited and slew its attackers . A local witch told Sir John he could kill it if he would fix razor blades to his armor and vow to kill the first living thing he saw after vanquishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beldame said , for nine generations no Lambton would die in his bed . <P> Making his vow and donning his razor blades , Sir John challenged the Worm . They fought on a rock in the river , and after the Worm had wounded itself on the blades Sir John hacked it in two with his sword . One half floated down the river and , unable to rejoin , the Worm died . But Sir John did not kill the next living creature he saw . It was his father . The next nine generations of Lambtons died violent deaths . <P> Dormant for centuries , the Curse of the Worm is apparently regaining power . The suicidal Viscount 's uncle was killed in World War I. One cousin disappeared from a liner , another died in a car smash . Two years ago his grandmother was killed by a fall . When he was ten , young Lambton himself disappeared mysteriously for several days . One night last week servants heard the Viscount in the kitchen cooking his usual midnight snack of ham &; eggs . Next morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawn , his brains blown out by a charge from his own gun .
