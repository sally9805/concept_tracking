There was always something odd about Edward John Burra . His classmates laughed when they caught him daubing red paint on the noses of classical plaster casts at art school , but they watched in awed wonder when he took to drinking champagne out of ashtrays and washing his face in film developer . When Burra 's health forced him to quit school and moderate his prankish ways , he retired to his parents ' house in Rye , on England 's South Coast , made a studio of his old top-floor nursery and settled down to work while gradually transforming the place into a fluttery nest of picture postcards , tabloid shock photos , scraps of comic strips and reproductions of such artists as Goya , George Grosz and Gustave Dore . <P> Burra 's fifth one-man show , opening in London 's Leicester Galleries last week . made suitably weird use of such source materials . His thick-painted water colors ( " I mix my paints with spit , mostly " ) represent public places from Mexico City and Harlem to Limerick and Toulon , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one representative specimen , the pale little painter with the pointed nose giggled : " Is n't that horrible ? It gives me a turn . I thoroughly like it ! " <P> Burra is Britain 's most successfully shocking surrealist . At 44 , he has done the sets and costumes for four ballets and an opera , consistently delighted his tight , bright circle of admirers with such fantasies as Procession ( see cut ) , in which evil red eyes peep from a paraded kettle . " See ? " Burra says , " It 's going to boil over and swamp them all . The beggar is getting out of the way-he has n't a chance . " <P> What does the picture mean ? Says Burra : " Bring in a psychoanalyst and we 'll find out . "
