MR . CHURCHILL-Philip Guedalla-Reynal &; Hitchcock ( $3 ) . <P> At Cowes , during a ball aboard a British cruiser one August night in the 1870s , the future Lord Randolph Churchill met three American girls named Jerome and promptly told a friend that he intended to marry " the dark one . " Next day he proposed and was accepted . To his ducal father 's natural question young Churchill replied : " Mr. Jerome is a gentleman who is obliged to live in New York to look after his business . I do not know what it is . " <P> Thus Britain 's No. 1 biographer , Philip Guedalla , suggests the prenatal impulses which may have affected the character of Britain 's impulsive Prime Minister , of whom he has written the most important and readable biography yet published . <P> Early in the 1920s Philip Guedalla charged into the battle of the books , shouting : " Historians ' English is not a style ; it is an industrial disease . " In its place he developed a lively and somewhat overarch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular reading as novels . It also boosted the sales of his books ( as one critic observed with Guedallan acidity ) " within measuring distance of the giddy heights attained by Mr. Edgar Wallace and Miss Elinor Glynn . " It was a style nicely adapted to describing the molting eagles of Napoleon I ( The Hundred Days ) and the tacky grandeurs of Napoleon III ( The Second Empire ) . But is it , as Mr. Guedalla himself would ask , is it the style with which to describe Britain 's great wartime leader , the human symbol in whom the terror , courage , hatreds and hopes of millions of democratic men are centered ? <P> Some readers will think not . They can nevertheless read Mr. Churchill for its author 's sense of history as a pageant of personalities , his eye for vivid , incongruous detail , his ability to compress masses of fact into a smooth ribbon of narrative . They can also read it to trace the development of Winston Churchill from the specious Victorian calm into which he was born , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a battered empire into four words : " We shall never surrender . " <P> Winston Churchill 's early life was like a series of military marches . He went to Ireland , where he remembers ( age four ) his grandfather , the Lord-Lieutenant , saying as he unveiled a Dublin statue : " . . . with a withering volley he shattered the enemy 's line . " " Nor , " says Author Guedalla , " was the martial infant . . . unaware of the nature of a volley . . . . " <P> He went back to London , where by the age of seven he had built up an army of nearly 1 , 000 toy soldiers . He went to Harrow , where he once by mistake pushed a star athlete into the swimming pool , displayed typical Churchill tact in his apology . " I am very sorry , " he said , " I mistook you for a Fourth Form boy . You are so small . My father , who is a great man , is also small . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned him into a cavalry subaltern . Then he went to Cuba , where he acquired a taste for cigars and siestas . He anticipated Rough Rider Theodore Roosevelt 's visit by two years . " Imagination falters , " says Guedalla , " at the possibilities of an encounter on the same terrain . "
