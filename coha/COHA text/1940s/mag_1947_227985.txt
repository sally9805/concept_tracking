Foreign Minister Jos Vincente Trujillo had a wonderful time in the U.S.A. First he took a wife : 33-year-old Mary Louise Wellensiek of Pomona , Calif. , whom he had met about a year ago at a presidential reception in Quito . Then he had a friendly chat with Harry Truman , came away impressed by the President 's " grasp of modern and ancient Ecuadorian history . " Finally last week , as his North American honeymoon ended , Trujillo announced that he had wangled two $4 million loans from the U.S. Export-Import Bank , to complete modernization of the water systems of Ecuador 's capital and chief port . <P> Quito ( pop . 160,000 ) , wrinkled in a tight little Andean valley , gets its water from rivulets and springs in the mountains , has a fair supply only during the rainy season . But even when the clouds open , distribution pumps often break down . Hilltop houses generally have water only at night , if at all . On Quito streets Indian women carrying buckets in search of water are as familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indignant letter-writer in Quito 's El Comercio : " In the morning the cook must take a streetcar to the hospital to see if she can get some water . She usually returns late and without any , so we have lunch at 4 p.m. without a drop to wash our hands . . . . Whenever I need a shave , I buy a bottle of beer . " <P> Distribution is not the only problem . The reservoirs are supplied by open ditches in which Indians delight in bathing . Result : contamination that may have been worsened by leakage from the city 's sewer system , which dates back to colonial times . <P> With the $8 million , Ecuador plans to provide Quito with new pumps and water mains to every part of the city . Some of the money will be spent on the steaming port of Guayaquil ( pop . 170,000 ) , which shares most of the water troubles that plague the capital . Guayaquil will get a system of artesian wells to supplement the present source of supply , the stinking , putrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty of water to drink , a bath a day for everyone .
