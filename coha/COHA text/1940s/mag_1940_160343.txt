The day Woodrow Wilson returned to the White House after his re-election in 1916 , Washington was taut as a fiddle string . Wilson had received no clear mandate . His campaign shibboleth had been the cry that he had kept the country out of war , a fact which Wilhelm of Germany subsequently misinterpreted . Less than six months after that day in November 1916 , Wilson , who loved peace , led a tragically unprepared U. S. into war . <P> On the cold , windy day last week when Franklin Roosevelt returned to Washington , there was a sense of relief that a bitter election was over . Roosevelt had received a more impressive electoral majority than Wilson . His mandate for a strong foreign policy , upheld even by the rival candidate , was also clearer than Wilson 's . U. S. shipping was so far unscathed. * <P> President Roosevelt looked tired and grey last week as he rode from Union Station , cheered all the way by 200,000 Washingtonians who had been let out of Government offices and schools for the occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fedora to the crowd which followed him to the White House door , swarming over the lawn . He stepped out again to face them and wave . Then he retired . His files were jammed , his desk was piled . <P> The country 's bank account was very nearly overdrawn . Franklin Roosevelt , amateur economist , had a decision to make : whether to levy heavier taxes , lift the lid off the bubbling national debt , or resort to outright monetary inflation . He conferred long with Secretary Morgenthau . Mr. Morgenthau flew a tentative kite , suggested raising the debt limit to 60 or 65 billion dollars , and stripping exemptions from Federal , State and municipal securities ( see p. 73 ) , watched to see how public opinion blew . <P> The spreading war in the Balkans , Axis moves in Europe , the Far East , bases for the U. S. Navy in the Far East-each had its own terrific complexity . Most pressing problem of all was defense production . Still oppressive was business ' fear of Franklin Roosevelt . His difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who said in aristocratic puzzlement after the election : <P> " I ca n't understand why business hates Franklin so , and why they talk about his stirring up class hatred , because there is nothing in his heart like that . We were always taught not to think whether anyone was rich or poor . ... " <P> Businessmen smiled grimly and waited to see what Franklin would do next . Many a U. S. citizen believed with the President last week that the security of the U. S. depends on Britain 's defense . The problem of sending more aid to Britain was pulled out , laid upon the President 's full desk . What would be the reaction of the U. S. to letting the British have the Army 's secret bomb sight ? <P> At his first press conference after the election , Franklin Roosevelt , in jovial good humor , sat and parried the questions of 200 newsmen . He revealed that his guess on the election had been the same as it was in 1936 : 340 electoral votes . He got 523 then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was less jovial over a question from Scripps-Howard 's Fred Perkins about a " fourth term " ( see p. 68 ) . He denied that he had even thought of taking Wendell Willkie into his Cabinet .
