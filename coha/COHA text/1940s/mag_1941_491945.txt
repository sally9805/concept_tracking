W HEN the old American Airways was fighting to establish itself , it suffered from a president who wanted no part of what he was trying to sell the public . He hated to ride in airplanes , and did n't . One day something went wrong on the West Coast end of the system and the district manager got this stern wire from the boss : " Unless condition remedied immediately , will jump train and come out there and fire you . " The most incensed man in the system , when news of the telegram got around , was Cyrus Rowlett Smith , a lanky , sardonic Texan , who was vice-president in charge of the Southern division . Smith had got his first taste of aviation as the bookkeeper-manager of a hush air line in Texas . Flying got intohis blood and just before American Airways had absorbed him and his line he had become a working pilot . He had an almost religious faith that air travel was as safe intrinsically as any other form of travel , but the public had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be if the president of an air line avoided riding in his own ships ? To Smith , this was the unforgivable sin , and he showed his dislike of his boss whenever they met , which usually was at executive conferences in Chicago headquarters . Smith would prop his feet on the boss ' desk and pretend to read a magazine while his superior talked . He studiously addressed his chief as " Prez. , " and disagreed in hearty plains9the total passenger business done by the twenty air lines operating in the United States . Its annual report for 19-10 is expected to show a net profit of $2,000,000 . During the brief period in which this small financial miracle was worked , Smith has seen his young dream of safety aloft come true . Since January 14 , 1936 , when one of his flagships plowed into an Arkansas swamp and killed seventeen persons , American has not had an accident in which a passenger 's life was lost . Between the time of the Arkansas smashup and last December first , a period of nearly five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 949,415,227 passenger miles . Eight or ten years ago few persons besides Smith dared to 10 hope that such a thing could happen . That it has happened is partly the result of Smith 's frank acknowledgment of the potential dangers of flying . This policy has caused him to have inserted in the masthead of the employees ' magazine the reminder . " Aviation is not unsafe , but , like the sea , it is terribly unforgiving of any carelessness or neglect . " To make sure that the warning does not lose its edge from repetition , Smith resharpens it in memoranda to his employees every time another line has an accident . " You wash out safety , you wash out American Airlines , " is the laconic way he expresses it in private conversation . Smith has elected himself an exemplar of the vigilance which he preaches . In carrying out his role he has completely reversed the nonflying policy of his timid predecessor . Today Smith flies more than 100,000 miles a year , mostly on inspection and business trips . He is on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and he does n't know where he is when he wakes up in a strange hotel bed . The problem of orientation was a tough one until he hit . upon a plan of draping a copy of a local newspaper and a hotel towel over the foot of the bed before retiring . T HE cost to Smith of his omnipresence is the one paid by most men who have tried to run a good air line ? the sacrifice of a normal home life . Smith was warned that this would happen when his engagement was announced shortly after he had been made president of the company . Old-timers told him that a man could n't be successfully married to a woman and an air line at the same time . Smith grinned and went ahead with plans for the wedding . In the week preceding the date set he scarcely saw his bride-to-be . One of his sleeper planes washed off its landing gear at El Paso and Smith flew there to find out why . At Louisville an American ship cracked up in landing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sister ship descended alongside it and did the same thing . Near Speculator , New York , one of Smith 's air liners got lost in a snowstorm and made an incredible crash landing on a mountain without an occupant being killed . During the two days that passed before the wreck was located , Smith was in New York directing the search . By luck he got to his wedding on time . His bride was Elizabeth Manget , a pretty Dallas Junior Leaguer . A minor accident in the West took Smith away from his bride a few days after they had settled down in a Chicago apartment . Then came a series of aviation mishaps which caused uneasiness among the pilots of all the air lines . Smith flew about the country bucking up pilot morale and driving home the message of vigilance among his maintenance crews . The more he traveled the more he saw the need of his presence all around the widely scattered system . He put himself on call twenty-four hours a day . If Mrs. Smith planned a small dinner , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his office at noon , would be trouble-shooting in St. Louis or Buffalo when her soup course was being served . Two years ago the Smiths were expecting a child . Not wanting to risk being alone when the baby arrived , Mrs. Smith went to her parents ' home in Dallas to await t he event . The day the baby was expected Smith was tied up in downtown New York on a hearing which meant much to American Airlines . During recesses he kept in touch with developments in Dallas by telephone . As the day wore on he estimated that if he caught a certain evening plane for the West he would get to Dallas in time . A reservation was made accordingly . When the hearing closed , Smith sped to the airport by taxicab . The weather in the Midwest was fogging up , and when the plane landed at Columbus it was so murky that the flight was canceled . Smith went the rest of the way by train arid was met at the hospital by a nurse holding a son who was many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way for married people to live . Since the baby was born , Mrs. Smith has remained at her parents ' and Smith has made his home in a New York apartment . Under this arrangement they see about as much of each other as before , as Smith 's duties often take him to Texas . There are no servants in the New York hermitage except a man who comes in a few hours each day to straighten up . Smith eats no more then two or three meals a month at home and hires a cook when he does . He has a democratic weakness for bringing home pilots , mechanics and baggage smashers , and entertaining them at dinner . The rest of the time Smith oatrcmizes steak and chile joints . A devotee of substantial low-priced food , Smith still gets a pained look when he recalls the first time he ordered a ham-and-eggs breakfast in a New York hotel . The check was $2.70 . He holds that a fair price for ham and eggs is thirty-five cents . Smith 's salary is $25,000 a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His board of directors has several times urged him to accept an increase and he has turned down offers of as high as $60,000 from companies engaged in other types of work . He tells his directors that be thinks as much of the profits as possible should be put back into an expanding business like theirs . To the tempters from outside he replies that no other business could possibly be as much fun as operating an air line . " Besides , " he adds , " I would probably spend so much time at the airport , watching the airplanes , you 'd have to get rid of me . " Smith seems actually to have a pereenal affection for his line . In addition to working an ordinary day , he often returns to his desk in the hours when the scrubwomen are at work . When writing something that requires especially careful phrasing , surh as advertising copy , Smith likes to do his own typing and he finds the quiet of early morning the best time for it . An evening spent at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith takes , squatting , in a clothes closet . His idea of a restful week end is to make a flying tour of part of his circuit , inspecting ticket-office procedure , passenger and pilot accommoda- tions , toilet facilities , and so on . In a typical week end he will cover Buffalo , Hartford , Providence and Boston and be back at work at nine o'clock on Monday morning . To Smith it is a pleasant , if somewhat lonesome , life . He wears thirty-five-dollar suits , which he buys at a special rate of three for $100 , and to save on taxi fare he mooches rides home from the airport from employees who have automobiles . Smith owns no car . Since last July he has been spending more time than usual in Washington , where he is the air-transport adviser to Ralph Budd , president of the Burlington Railroad , who is in charge of co-ordinating all forms of transportation for national defense . His only other side activity . outside of an occasional hunting trip , is the rather strenuous one of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrifices , taking part in sessions of shin-kicking , a pastime which rivals dominoes as the official game of Texas . When one Texan kicks another in the shins , the person thus greeted returns the kick , and this goes on , alternately and with increasing violence , until one party has had enough . It also includes an exuberant game of kicking out low-hanging electric bulbs . Smith is long-legged and a star in this sport . Even practical joking in the Texas fashion has its hazards . Once , at a barbecue given by his friend , Amon Carter , the Fort Worth grandee , Smith loaded a revolver with blank cartridges and wrapped his coat around the weapon . Holding the bundled revolver behind his back , he began a conversation with his host , intending to surprise him by discharging the pistol as they talked . The gun went off prematurely and set fire to Smith 's coat , ruining it . Like Carter , Smith is always buying up quantities of guns , knives and Mexican silver and leather goods , and distributing them among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " now " and a one-cent coin a " pinny , " has decorated his apartment so that it looks like the Great American Southwest wing of a natural-history museum . In his bedroom the beds and dresser are made of cactus wood and the window drapes of chaps leather . An old frontier pistol forms the upright part of a lamp on the night stand . Near the bed are a phonograph and a record library consisting solely of doleful cowboy songs . At night before going to sleep , Smith sometimes amuses himself by sitting up in bed , from which he has a window view of the glittering midtown skyline , and playing ballad after ballad . They are so sad they make him laugh , he says . The Crying Cowboy is his favorite . The beds in the guest room have weather-worn wagon wheels at the head and oxen yokes for footboards . Navaho rugs and seven or eight bear rugs clutter up a high-ceilinged living room whose walls are hung with bleached cattle skulls , stuffed buffalo heads and spreading horns from Texas steers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russell , Schreyvogel and Remington , and owns some Western bronzes by the latter two . Most of the furniture is made of ! Continued an Page 69 ) Normally , there was chattering in the askari huts . There would he shouts from about the village . Fires would be burning and lamps moving . But there was nothing of this tonight , and not even a cooking fire glowed . " You know , it is quirt , " Crawford agreed , and they listened again . " This is queer . " Turner left his coffee and went to the edge of the veranda , staring into the darkness . " There is something funny going on , Bill . " Coombes sat up . " I 've felt it all afternoon . " " Zia told me there was some sort of hubari about , " Crawford answered , and that was the first reference he had made to her visit . The silence closed in again . It lasted for long , acute seconds , then Turner 's voice sounded with edged , unnatural sharpness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peering , and the others looked with him . They SSIV : a dark figure halt in the shadow against the end of the veranda , away from the light of the ? lamps . Who is it ? " Turner demanded . " Effendi ! " the figure answered , and an arm moved in salute . " It 's Magahul , " Turner Raid , and the man was hard to see , because he wore a blue police jumper and blue shorts . " What d' you want ? " Coombes asked , and jerked to his feet . " Busana nikierci. " the sergeant answered . " Well , come here then I " Turner exclaimed . The man remained in the shadow , saying nothing more . " What 's the matter with you ? " Coombes asked curtly . " Come here ! " " All right , Herbie ! " Crawford stepped - off the veranda , " What is it , Maga ' but ? " " Bryant mk Abdi Hammud comes to make a dead man in your house , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shoot from the dark . " The man 's arm lifted in salute , then he slipped away , moving quickly and silently . Turner and the others came out to the sand . " What d' you make of that ? " Crawford asked . " Well , it sounds as though Ham-mud 's out there with a gun ! " Coombes exclaimed . Turner looked toward the fence and the gloom of the bush beyond . " We 'd better round him up before he can start any nonsense . " " And let 's douse these lamps . " Coombea went toward them . " Wait a bit ! " Crawford called . " He might start loosing off ! " " They do n't give much light . " Crawford went on coolly . " This is what the habari was about . " " I said there was something up ! " Coombes reminded him . Megabit ! had disappeared . The post was altogether silent , and Crawford sensed something watchful in its quiet . He glanced through the fence to the still blackness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hammud 's been delegated by the Shifts to knock me off . " " It 's more a grudge with him , " Turner suggested . " Do n't stand out here in the light arguing about it ! " Herbie Coombes said urgently . " He 's in the hush with a gun ! " ) . " Send some men out there to grab him ! " Dewey exclaimed . " That 'd look as though I 'm afraid of him , " Crawford replied . " We must n't let them think that . " Crawford knew that every native in and about the post was waiting to see what action he would take ; that was why they were so quiet . They were all afraid of Hammud , and he knew that he must follow a course which they would understand and appreciate . He moved back to the house , and Coorribm spoke impatiently . " Well , we ca n't hang about like this , " he said . " What are we going to do , Bill ? " " I 'll sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced about the veranda . " and make a target for him . " " Do n't be a fool ! " Turner exclaimed . " His aim is n't likely to be good in the dark . " " Bill " ? and Turner bent to him " there 's no need to take a risk like this . He might be a damned good shot ! " " You be on the machine gun in that redoubt , Roddy , " Crawford went on steadily , and the others listened then . " When he shoots , let him have half a belt of ammunition . " " Oh ! I see what you 're after , " Turner said slowly . " Herbie , you are to stand by the gate with half a dozen of your wogs . When the shooting 's over , go out and get him . " " He 'll be shooting to kill , Bill , " Turner said quietly . " You 'll be doing the same , Roddy , " Crawford replied . " And , Dewey , will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll have a lamp on the table , so that he can see me clearly , and I 'd like you to be handy , just in case I do n't duck quickly enough . " " Now listen , Bill ? - " and Coombes tried to protest . " Shut up , Herbie , " Crawford said . " Be a good fellow and obey orders , will you ? " Crawford knew quite well what he was doing . To send men out into the bush and arrest the most feared Somali in I he district would be easy and would mean little . But to set trap for trap , to give Hammud fell opportunity of achieving his worst , and then to strike remorselessly back at him  --  that was something which would farm great hahuri and would travel across half Africa . And it might , perhaps , deter the Shiite a little , They made their preparations without haste . Turner went to get the machine gun mounted , and Coombes collected some askaris . In the darkness of the house . Crawford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one corner ; then placed water and some bandages and field dressings behind it . Crawford laid his loaded revolver on the table , which he moved just clear of the veranda . When Ibrahim , his boi , brought word that Coombes and Turner were ready , Dewey lifted down the lamps that hung outside . He extinguished one , gave the other to Crawford , then joined Ibrahim in the corner . Crawford took his place at the table , with the lamp arranged nut to shine in his eyes , and so that he could look out to where the harbwire shimmered faintly . He was using an empty pen , appearing to write against sheets of paper , working as he sometimes did in the evenings , occasionally putting one aside as though he had filled it . His head was bent , but his gaze was concentrated on the soft blackness beyond the fence . No sound at all came from about the post , but the natives knew what P LATES and bridges soak up odors and impurities like a // sae occurring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their heels . silent , listening , staring . Askaris arid their women watched from reds ailed huts . By the gate to the camel track , Herbie Coombes crouched with his revolver ready ; with him were Sergeant Magahul and half a dozen men , bayon  --  ts fixed . In the half-finished redoubt , Turner bent with his thumbs poised on the trigger of the Maxim ; Sergeant Kumakwa held the slack of an ammunition belt threaded into the breech , and un askari bent over the sandbags , listening . A long time passed and nothing happened . " How long have we been here . Dewey ? " Crawford changed one blank sheet for another . " About half an hour , " Dewey answered . " I wish he 'd get it over . " Crawford 's pen scratched on ; then . : fluddenly , he reached for his revolver . his gaze still on the hush . Dewey had le-come tense in his corner . " There 's someone out back , " he whispered . " Who is it ? " Crawford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screened doorway in the back wall of the room . The screen shifted and , before Dewey himself saw anyone there , Ibrahim murmured at his elbow , " Mem-sahib ! " Zia slipped in . Her face was pale . " It 's me , Bill ! " " For Pete 's sake ! " Dewey started from his corner , and Crawford heard him move . " Stay where you are , Dewey . or you 'll give the game away ! " he called sharply , not turning , still watching the bush as he went on . " Zia , do n't come in here ! " " Hammud 's got men with him ! " she exclaimed , and moved nearer the table . " Zia , you 're not helping ! " He swung to face her , and Dewey called violently , " Do n't take your eyes off the hush , Bill ! " Immediately , Crawford turned again to watch the dangerous darkness beyond the fence , and Zia suddenly moved sideways to a corner formed by a stump of the veranda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll he all right here , and I want to talk to Bill ! " She bent low , crouching to the floor . Crawford glanced quickly at her , then his pen began to scratch again . " Bill , Hammud 's got two men with him , and they 're both Shiite , " she said . " I 've only just got the Wiwi from Miriami , and I wanted to warn you about it . " " Thank you , Zia , " Crawford answered , and his tone was curt from the strain of the half hour that had passed . " Only do n't stay there , for heaven 's sake ! " " Watch the hush ! " Dewey called , and craned over the trunks . . . . " Zia , you get out of here , will you ? " If you do n't " Crawford begun , then stopped abruptly . A tongue of red slit the dark . He snatched at his revolver and pitched himself sideways , knocking over the lamp . Flame spurted and died as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pullets smashed against the table and walls . " He 's got a machine gun ! " Dewey yelled . The hammering of the weapon came from where the blur of ruddy light shuddered beyond the wire . Turner 's Maxim slammed instantly into action , while over by the gate Herbie Coombes shouted into the dark , " Let him have it ! Crease him , Roddy ! Crease him ! " The tearing rush of bullets ripped into the house , spattering the table and gouging the floor , smashing mud from the walls , filling the air with a whining sound . Dewey heard them hit the trunks , behind which he had flattened with Ibrahim , thudding into the wall beyond . Abruptly they stopped coming , but the Maxim continued firing . " Roddy 's got him ! " Crawford jerked to his feet , shouting . " Zia ! " Dewey came from his corner , stumbling across the floor . There was a crash as Crawford slung the table out of the way and jumped the veranda . The Maxim checked , and Turner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are you all right , Bill ? " " Yes , come on ! - Crawford began to run , while Coombes called from the gate , " The swine had a machine gun ! " " Spread your men out , Herbie ! " Crawford shouted as he went away from the house . " After him ! " Zia had come upright . She was looking out across the veranda as Dewey reached her , dragging a flash lamp from his hack pocket . He clicked on the light , and saw she was holding her right arm , high up near the shoulder . " You got hit ! " Yes . " She looked at her hand as she drew it away . Blood smudged her fingers and welled aslant on the curve of her shoulder muscle . " Ibrahim , bring that stuff over ! " Dewey touched her shoulder gently .... " Is it painful ? " " Not very , " She looked into the darkness , gazing after Crawford . " Bill forgot about me , " and she laughed shakily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamps as Coombes and Crawford dodged through thornbushes , ask aria spread out at either side , Turner racing up behind . A hundred yards beyond the wire Sergeant Magabul yelled suddenly . A native lay on the ground  --  a lean , fuzzy-haired man , wearing a brown Auks , barefooted , with a skin almost coal black . " Hammud had men with him ! " Coombes exclaimed . " You got one of ' em , Roddy ! " " That 's where the gun was ! " Crawford pointed to a swath of shell cases , smoke-slashed and thrown irregularly on the sand . " Where did Hammud get a machine gun from ? " Turner asked . " That 's what I want to know ! " Crawford exclaimed .. . . " Magabul , take this ! Look for tracks ! " He pushed his flash lamp into the sergeant 's hand just as an askari yelled from one side . They saw him jump around a hush , his bayonet ready . Another Shifts lay there , dead . " That 's two , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to heavy footprints in damp sand . " Abdi Hammud , " he grunted . " He 's making for the river ! " Crawford exclaimed . " And he 's got the gun ! " " He 'll try and cross by the watering place , " Coombes told him . " You go left with three wogs , and cut him of if he heads past it ! " Crawford called . . . . " Come on , Roddy ! " Coombe went away with three excited askaris , his flesh lamp flickering on silvered thorns and budding branches . Magabul led Crawford and Turner , running fast , picking up traces of the tracks that Hammud had left . The blackness of the jungle strip came 4 like a wall before them , and the tracks showed clear on the wet earth of a path that twisted down to the watering place . " We ca n't miss him now Turner exclaimed . His voice was high , tense , and the mad ring of the Maxim was still in his head . " If he gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crawford replied . At the other side of the stream wag thin jungle , broken by rough boulders and craggy rocks in which great troops of baboon . lived . Once Hammud got amongst the rocks his tracks would be lost , while the fury of the disturbed baboons would cover his escape . Their flash lamps caught the serrated trunks of doum palms and showed looping creepers . Eyes glowed like tinted lights out of the gloomy undergrowth while jungle life roused , screaming and frightened . The path widened to the soggy expanse of the watering place , and Coombes appeared with his men at the opposite side . Flash lamps sent white beams over the flats to which camels and cattle came , and across the swollen river channels between them . They lit sandbanks that were all but flooded in midstream , marked by a litter of broken branches , and the beams caught something which moved there . " That 's him ! " Turner called . They saw Abdi Hammud , wading chest-deep between two sand flats , the machine gun slanted across his . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . The man turned to look , then . plunged on . " We 've got him , Bill ! " Turner exclaimed , and gestured to the askaris . " Load ! " ? Rifle bolts rattled . Hammud clambered from the water and went running across a flat . The flash lamps picked him out clearly , wet and shining , his great shoulders heaving , his free arm working for balance as he threw himself on . " I 'll give him a last chance ! " Crawford exclaimed . " Do n't let him get away ! " Coombes yelled . " Hammud ! " Crawford shouted . " Stop , or we shoot ! " Still the big Somali went on , running wildly now . 1 " All right , " Crawford said then . " Let him have it , Roddy ! " " One round ! " Turner called . " Fire ! " Rifles splurged in a ragged volley . Hammud seemed to catch himself up , but still he went on , slithering down to the water in another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Crawford said . The askaris fired once more . Hammud half turned , then keeled over , slipping down with the river swilling over him and the gun falling out of sight . Crawford remained for a moment with the sharp reek of cordite in his nostrils , The beams from the flash lamps were bright where Hammud had been and the trees behind were noisy with life that screamed from fear . " All right , " Crawford said at last . " That 's it ! Get the gun , Roddy ! "
