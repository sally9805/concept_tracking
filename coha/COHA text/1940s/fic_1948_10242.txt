horizon in one clear swatch of sky that seemed infinite miles away . The rain was very cold now , almost frigid , and they shuddered . Almost all the tents were down in the bivouac area , and here and there a soldier would go skittering through the mud , staggering from the force of the wind with the odd jerking motions of a man walking in a motion picture when the film is unwinding too rapidly . " Christ , I 'm freezin ' , " Toglio shouted . " Let 's get out of here , " Wyman said . He was covered with mud and his lips were chattering . " Goddam rain , " he said . They stumbled out of the hole , and began to run toward the motor pool where there would be some shelter in the lee of the trucks . Toglio staggered as though he had lost some necessary ballast and was being driven downwind without any way to control himself . Goldstein shouted to him , " I forgot my rifle . " " You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to halt and turn around but it was impossible . " You never can tell , " he heard himself shout . They were running side by side , but it felt as if they were roaring to each other across a vast room . Goldstein had a moment of glee . For a whole week they had worked on improving their bivouac . Every spare moment , there had been something new to set up . And now his tent was lost , his clothing and writing paper were sopping , his gun would probably rust , the ground would be too wet for sleeping . Everything was ruined . He had the kind of merriment a man sometimes knows when events have ended in utter disaster . He and Toglio were blown into the motor pool . They collided as they tried to turn and went sprawling in the mud . Goldstein felt like lying there without getting up , but he put his hands against the ground , pushed and went staggering behind one of the trucks . Almost the entire company was in the trucks or bunched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty men clustered together behind the truck he had reached . They stood there shivering and huddled together for warmth , their teeth chattering from the icy rain . The sky was an immense dark bowl that crashed and quaked with thunder . All Goldstein could see was the green truck , and the wet green-black uniforms of the men . " Jesus , " somebody said. 100Toglio was trying to light a cigarette , but it soaked through and came apart in his mouth before he could get his matches out of his waterproof pouch . He threw it to the ground and watched it dissolve in the mud . Despite the fact that he was completely wet , the rain still hurt ; every drop that went down his back was like a cold slug , shockingand loathsome . He turned to the man next to him , and shouted , " Your tent go down ? " " Yeah . " It made Toglio feel better . He rubbed his black unshaved chin , and felt intimate suddenly with all the men , liked them immensely with a burst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans , he told himself . It took Americans to stand something like this and laugh about it , he decided . His hands were cold , and he stuck them in the baggy pockets of his fatigue pants . Red and Wilson , who were standing a few feet away , had begun to sing . Red 's voice was deep and gruff , and Toglio laughed as he listened to them . Once 1 built a railroad , made it run , Made it race against time .. . they sang , and jogged up and down to warm their feet . Once I built a railroad , now it 's done , Brother , can you spare a dime ? Toglio found himself roaring with laughter . Red was a comic , e told himself , and began to hum with them . Once 1 built a tower to the sun , Bricks and rivet and lime , Once I built a tower , now it 's done , Brother , can you spare a dime ? Toglio joined in on the last line , and Red beckoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loudly as they could , their arms about each other for warmth . The wind had abated to some degree , and they101could bear their voices clearly every now and then , but they sounded distant and a little unreal , like a radio in another room being turned up and down , up and down . Once in khaki suits Gee , we looked swellFull of that Yankee Doodly Dum . Half a million boots went sloggin'thru Hell , 1 was the kid with the drum . Say , do n't you remember , they call me Al ? It was Al all the time . Say , do n't you remember , I 'm your pal ? Buddy , can you spare a dime ? They started laughing as they finished , and Toglio yelled , " What do we sing next ? How about Show Me The Way to Go Home ' ? " " I ca n't sing , " Red shouted . " My throat 's too dry . I need a drink . " He pursed his mouth and rolled his eyes , and Toglio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red was . They were all good guys . " Show me the way to go home , " Toglio sang , and several other men began to sing with them . I 'm tired and 1 want to go to bed , I had a little drink about an hour ago , And it 's gone right to my head . The rain had become hard and steady , and Toglio had a wistful mellow feeling as he chanted the words . He was cold , and despite the bodies about him he kept shivering . He had an image of driving in a car on a winter twilight , approaching a strange town which beckoned to him with its warmth and lights . Wherever I may roam , On land or sea or foam , You can always hear me singing this song , Show me the way to go home . It was almost dark , and in the lee of the truck underneath the coconut trees it was becoming difficult to see the men 's faces . Toglio 's mood deepened , became sad and gentle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas tree , and a tear ran down his heavy fleshy cheeks . For a minute or so he felt completely removed from the war , from the rain , from everything ; he knew that in a little while he would be having to consider where and how he would sleep , but for this brief moment he sang resolutely , wriggling his toes , letting all the soft sensuous memories that the songs evoked flow unresisting through his mind . A jeep came wallowing through the mud and came to a halt about thirty feet from them . He saw General Cummings and twrn other officers dismount , and he nudged Red to stop singing . The ' General was bareheaded and his uniform was completely wet , but . he was smiling . Toglio looked at him with interest and some reverence . He had seen the General many times in the bivouac area but this was the first time he had been so close . " You men , you men here , " the General shouted as he came near them , " how do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others . General Cummings grinned . " It 's all right , " he shouted , " you 're not made of sugar . " The wind ebbed , and in a more normal tone he said to a major and lieutenant who were with him , " I do believe the rain 's about to halt . I just telephoned Washington , and the War Department assured me it was bound to stop . " The two officers laughed vigorously , and Toglio round himself smiling . The General was a swell guy , a perfect examaleof an officer . " Now , men , " the General said loudly , " I do n't believe there 's a tent that 's still up in the area . As soon as the storm lifts , we 'll try to bring up some ponchos from the beach , but I have no doubt some of you are going to be wet tonight . It 's to be regretted , but you 've been wet before . A bit of trouble has started up on the line , and some of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He paused for a moment , standing in the rain ; then he added with a twinkle , " I as-102103sume that none of you left a guard post when the storm broke . If any of you are here who should n't be , you better get the hell back as soon as I leave . " There was a snicker from the men . Since the rain had eased , most of the company had drifted over toward the truck where the General was talking . " Seriously , men , from what we heard before the communications went out , I 've an idea there are going to be some Japs inside our lines tonight , so you better keep an extremely alert guard . We 're fairly far back from the front , but we 're not that farback . " He smiled at them , got back into his jeep , followed by the officers , and drove out of the area . Red spat . " I knew we been havin ' it soft too long . Two to one they send us out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaking his head angrily . " When you have itgood it don ' pay to bitch . All those replacements wantin ' to see combat , they 're gon na change they mind . " Toglio interrupted . " Gee , the General is a swell guy , " he said . Red spat again . " They ai n't a general in the world is any good . They 're all sonsofbitches . " " Listen , Red , " Toglio protested , " where could you find a general like that who 'd talk to a bunch of GIs ? He 's okay for my money . " " He 's a crowd-pleaser , that 's all he is , " Red told him . " What thefug business has he got tellin ' us his worries ? I got enough of my own . ' Toglio sighed and stopped talking . What a contrary guy Red was , he decided finally . It had stopped raining and he thought of goingback to the remains of his tent . The idea depressed him , but Toglio would not allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Come on , we might as well fix up some way to sleep , " he said . Red grunted . " It wo n't do you any good . We 're gon na be upon the line tonight . " With nightfall , the air was becoming sultry again . The General was worried . After the jeep pulled out of the motor pool he said to his driver , " Take us to headquarters battery of the one-five-one . " He turned around to Major Dalleson and Lieutenant Hearn , who were squeezed together uncomfortably in the back seat . " If their line is n't in to Second Battalion we 'll be doing some walking before the night is over . " The jeep passed through an opening in the barbed wire and turned right onto the road that led toward the front . The General scrutinized it morosely . The mud was very bad and it would become worse . Now it was slimy and the jeep skidded and weaved from one side of the road to the other , but in a few hours it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicles might bog down to their hubs . He gazed dully at the jungle on either side of the road . They passed a few Jap corpses decomposing in a ditch and the General held his breath . No matter how familiar that smell had become , he could never bear it casually . He made a mental note to have a burial detail police the road once this trouble was over . The night had come and with it a potential disaster . In the jeep motoring forward slowly through the darkness , Cummings had a sensation of being suspended in air . The steady drone of the motor , the silence of everyone in the vehicle , and the heavy wet rustling of the jungle seemed to strip him of everything but the quick absorbed functioning of his mind . Alone , settled by himself somewhere in space , he had to work this out . The storm had come with amazing rapidity , following in the wake of a Japanese attack . Ten minutes before the rain had begun , he had had a message from 2nd Battalion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines . And then the telephone lines had been cut to pieces in the storm , his headquarters had been laid flat , and the radio would not function . He had no idea of what was happening at the front . By now Hutchins might have pulled back 2nd Battalion . The Japs , driven on with a kind of frenzy generated by the gale , could conceivably have pene trated his front line in any number of places . With no orders coming through to them , Lord knew what might happen . If only headquarters battery had its line open to the front . At least he had moved a dozen tanks up two days ago to 2nd Battalion . They would never have been able to make it on the road tonight , nor , for that matter , could they advance now , but if necessary , a defense position could be organized around them tonight . What chaos there could be . The entire line might be a series of isolatedhedgehogs by tomorrow . And there was nothing he could do104 105until he got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days he might be back where he was when he started the pivoting operation . When he reached that telephone line , the decisions would have to be almost immediate . He reviewed the personalities of his line officers , remembered the distinguishing characteristics , if there were any , of different companies , even individual platoons . His acute memory reissueda spate of incidents and strength figures ; he knew effectively where every gun and every man on Anopopei was placed , and all this knowledge passed in an undigested flow through his head . At the moment he was an extremely simple man . Everything in him was functioning for one purpose , and from experience , with a confident unstated certainty , he knew that when demanded of him all this information would crystallize into the proper reactions . If he built up enough tension his instincts would not fail him . And with all this there was an intense and primitive rage . The storm had thwarted him , and his anger took childish forms . From time to time a spasm of irritation washed over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that storm , " he would mutter to himself every now and then . " A meteorological corps which does n't function . Army knew about it , but did they tell me ? No report of the storm , none at all . What bungling or perhaps not bungling at all . They 're trying to cross me . " At that moment the driver stalled the jeep in a rut . Cummings turned toward him . He could have shot him , but instead he murmured , " Come on , son , we have no time for that . " The jeep motor started again , and they continued on . His bivouac had been destroyed . That was the most painful fact of all . The dangers to the division occupied his mind , caused him a good deal of anxiety , but that was abstract . What hurt directly , personally , was the shambles in which he had left the bivouac . He felt a sense of grief almost , remembering how the rivulets had washed away the gravel walks , the way his cot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filth and wreckage of his tent . What a waste ! It angered him again . " You better turn on your lights , son , " he said to the driver . " This is going to take too long otherwise . " If any snipers were near it would106be like walking through a forest of thugs , carrying a candle . The General tensed pleasurably in his seat . Danger hada tang which madehim appreciate the magnitude of his work . " You 'd better cover the road on either side , " he said to Hearn and Dalleson . They pointed their carbines out the open sides of the jeep , scanning the jungle . With the lights on , the foliage was silvery , more mysterious . Lieutenant Hearn fingered the magazine on his carbine , removed it , clicked it into position again , holding the small rifle in his large hands , the muzzle pointed toward the jungle . He was in a complex mood with many elements of excitement and dejection . After all the order , all the well-timed advances , the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meantime their jeep wandered around like a nerve seeking for a muscle or organ to function upon . The General had once said to him , " I like chaos , it 's like the reagents foaming in the beaker before the precipitation of the crystals . It 's a kind of savory to me . " Which was a crock of the well-known article , Hearn had decided at the time . The General did n't like chaos , or rather he did n't like it when he was in the beaker . The only ones who liked it were men like himself , Hearn , who really were n't involved . Still , the General had reacted well . Hearn remembered the first apathy that had caught them all when the storm abated . The General had stared at his muddy cot for almost half a minute , and then had scraped oft a small handful of muck , which he kneaded in his fingers . That storm had cut the legs from them all , and yet the General had responded , made his incredibly urbane speech to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tucking up one 's tail and slinking off for some cover . That was understandable , however ; the General had had to recover the connotations of his command . And now he was comprehensible too . Hearn knew from the tone of his politeness , the quality of his voice , that he was thinking of nothing at all but the campaign and the night ahead . It made the General another man , definitely the nerve end with no other desire than to find something to act upon . It depressed Hearn even as it elicited his admiration . That type of concentration was inhuman , the process beyond his scope . He stared107glumly at the jungle before him , hefting the carbine in his hands again . It was possible that a Jap machine gun could be set up at the next bend in the road , or much more likely there might be a few Jap snipers with an automatic weapon or two . Their jeep would round the bend , be hit by a dozen bullets at once , and that would be the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And with him quite as casually would be lost a man who might be a genius , and an overgrown oaf like Dalleson , and a young nervous driver who was probably a potential Fascist . Like that . Turninga curve in the road . Or , obversely , he might kill a man himself . It would be a question of throwing up his rifle , pressing the trigger , and a particular envelope of lusts and anxieties and perhaps some goodness would be quite dead . All as easy as stepping on an insect , perhaps easier . That was the thing , that was what caused this mood . Everything was completely out of whack , none of the joints fitted . The men had been singing in the motor pool , and there had been something nice about it , something childish and brave . And they were here on this road , a point moving along a line in the vast neutral spaces of the jungle . And somewhere else a battle might be going on . The artillery , the small-arms fire they had been hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front , or it might be all concentrated now in the minuscule inferno of combat . None of it matched . The night had broken them into all the isolated units that actually they were . He became conscious again of Dalleson 's huge bulk against his owfi large body , and he stiffened a little . After a moment or two he fished a cigarette out of the breast pocket of his shirt and fumbled for a match . " Better not smoke , " Dalleson grunted . " The jeep lights are on . " " Yeah , " Dalleson grunted and was silent again . He shifted his seat slightly in the cramped rear of the jeep , and was annoyed at Hearn for taking up so much room , for smoking . Dalleson was nervous . He was n't worried in the least about an ambush . If it came , he would meet it coolly and acquit himself well . What bothered him was108what they were going to do when they got to the 151st Artillery . He had the anxiety of a dull student who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G-3 , in charge of operations and training , Dalleson was supposed to know the situation as well as the General , if not better , and without his maps and papers Dalleson felt lost . The General might depend on him for a decision , and that would be fatal . He twisted again in the seat , sniffed gloomily at Hearn 's cigarette smoke , and then bent forward and spoke in what he thought was a low voice , although it brayed out loudly , startlingly . " I hope everything 's okay when we get to the one-five-one , sir , " Dalleson shouted . " Yes , " the General said , listening to the spinning humming sounds of the tires as the jeep splashed through the mud . Dalleson 's bellow had grated on him . They had been driving for ten minutes with the headlights on , and his sense of danger had abated . He was worried again . If the line was n't in , they would have to go riding through the mud for another half hour at least , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be breaking through at this moment . There had to be communications . Without them . . . without them , it would be as though he were in the middle of a game of chess and someone had blindfolded him . He could guess what his opponent'snext move would be and answer it , but it would be more difficult to predict the next move , and the next , and he might be making responses which were wasted , if not fatal . The jeep sloughed around a curve , and as it came out of the turn its headlights shone on the startled eyes of a soldier behind a machine gun in an emplacement by the side of the road . The jeep pulled up tr him . " What the hell do you guys mean coming down the road with your lights on ? " he shouted . He saw the General and blinked . " Sorry , sir . " " It 's all right , son . You 're right , it 's bad business , breaking one of my own orders . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jeep turned off the road into the lane which lgfl to the bivouac of headquarters battery . Everything was dark in the area , and the General paused for a moment to orient himself . " The blackout tent is over109there , " he said , pointing , and the three officers set off and walked through the darkness , stumbling over the roots and shrubs of the imperfectlycleared ground . The night was very black with a tense quality about it that kept the officers from saying anything . They passed only one man in the fifty yards to the blackout tent . The General pushed aside the flaps and groped with distaste insidethe dark safety corridor . The tent had obviously blown down , peen dragged in the mud , and then erected again . The inside walls were slimy . At the end of the safety corridor he pushed aside a second set of flaps and walked inside . An enlisted man and a captain were sitting at a desk . The two men sprang to their feet . " Sir ? " the Captain said . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Alreadya few drops of sweat were forming on his forehead and back . " Where 's Colonel McLeod ? " he asked . " I 'll get him , sir . " " No , wait a minute , " the General said . " Can you tell me if the line to Second Battalion is in from here ? " " Yes , sir , it is . " The General felt a deep relief . " Ring them for me , please . " He lit a cigarette and smiled at Lieutenant Hearn . The Captain picked up the receiver out of a field telephone box , and cranked three times . " We have to relay it through B Battery , sir . " " I know , " the General said shortly . It was the one subject on which the General ever showed annoyance ; there was not a facet of the operations of the division with which he was not familiar . In a minute or two , the Captain handed the phone to the General . " Second Battalion , sir . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using the code name for Lieutenant Colonel Hutchins . " Samson , this is Camel , " he said , " I 'm talking from Pivot Red . What 's happening ? Are your lines through to Paragon White and Paragon Blue ? " " This is Samson . Yes , our circuits are open . " The voice was faint and distant and there was a buzzing in the earpiece . " Short , " the General muttered . " We 've been trying to get you , " Hutchins said . " We stopped the110attack on Paragon White B and C , and at Paragon Red E and G. " He gave the co-ordinates . " Personally I think it was a feeler , and they 're going to try again tonight . " " Yes , " the General said . He was busy estimating the possibilities . They would have to be reinforced . First Battalion of the 459th Infantry which he had been holding in reserve and working on the road , could be moved up in two hours , but he would have to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserves . The attackmight come sooner than that . The General debated , and decided finally to move up only two companies from 1st Battalion , save the other two for covering any retreat which might be necessary , and strip headquarters and service companies of all available platoons . He glanced at his watch . It was eight o'clock now . " Samson , " he said , " at about 2300 , Potential White Able and Dog will reach you by convoy march route . They are to make contact with Paragon White and ParagonRed where they will be used according to opportunity . I 'll direct that as the occasion demands . " Everything was extremely clear to him at this moment . The Japanese would be attacking tonight , probably against the entire line , but certainly against the flanks . The storm would have delayed Toyaku 's troops in reaching their assembly points , and chances were he would be unable to bring many tanks up . It could not be a probing attack , searching for weaknesses in the line . With the mud and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drive at a few points , and hope he could break them . This , the General felt , he could handle . " We 're going to have some ext rcnmcly powerful local attacks tonight , " he said into the mouthpiece . " I want you to contact all line units and instruct them to hold their ground . There is to be no general retreat . " " Sir ? " The voice at the other end of the phone was doubtful . " If the Japs can penetrate , let them . The companies on the flanks of any gap in the line are to hold their positions . I 'll court-martial any officer who pulls back his unit for tactical reasons . Anything that gets through us will be handled by the reserve . " Dalleson was bewildered . The one decisien he had made was that , with a newly established line and a few powerful Japanese thrusts on tap for the night , the safest thing would be to pull back the111troops a mile or two , and attempt to delay the attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the General had not asked his opinion . He had assumed immediately that the General was right and he was wrong . Hutchins was speaking again . " What about me ? Will I get any men ? " " Powerhouse will reach you at 2330 , " the General said . " You will deploy them between Paragon Red George and Paragon Red Easy at the following co-ordinates : 017.37 ? 439.56 , and at 018.25 ? 440.06 . " The General assigned these positions from a mental image of his battle map . " As additional support , I 'm going to send you a reinforced platoon from Paragon Yellow Sugar . They 're to be used for pack train and lateral communication with Paragon White , and if possible afterward as rifle support at Paragon White Baker or Cat . We 'll work that out as things go along . I 'm going to set up a temporaryCP here for the night . " Everything flowed out of him easily now , his decisions quick and instinctively just , he believed . The General could not have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung up , and gazed for a moment at Hearn and Dalleson , feeling a quiet impersonal affection for them both . " Going to be a lot doing tonight , " he murmured . Covertly , he noticed the artillery captain and the enlisted man looking at him almost in awe . With something like gaiety he turned to Dalleson . " I promised Hutchins a reinforced platoon . I 'm going to send up Pioneer and Demolition , but we 'll have to add a squad to that from some other platoon . " " How about I and R , sir ? " " Fine , we 'll give it to recon . Now , work out some march orders . Quickly , man ! " He lit a cigarette and turned to Hearn . " I suggest you pick us up some cots , Lieutenant . " Hearn was no bother to him at this moment . In the battle that followed that night , Dalleson 's suggestion to add a squad from recon to the pioneer and demolition platoon was the only contribution he made. 1125ROTH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meadow when Minetta wakened him for guard . He grumbled and tried to go back to sleep , but Minetta kept shaking him . " All right , all right , I 'm getting up , " he whispered angrily . He rolled over , groaned a little , got on his hands and knees , and shook his head . " Three hours ' guard tonight , " he realized with dread . Morosely he began to put on his shoes . Minetta was waiting for him in the machine-gun emplacement . " Jesus , it 's spooky tonight , " he whispered . " I thought I 'd be on for-ever. " of " Anything happen ? " Minetta gazed out at the black jungle before them . It was just possible to discern the barbed wire ten yards beyond the machine gun . I ' " I thought I heard some Japs sneaking around , " he muttered , " so keep your ears open . " Roth felt a sick fear . " Are you sure ? " " I du n no . The artillery 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think there 's a battle going on . " He listened . " Wait ! " A batteryfired a few miles away with a hollow clanging sound . " I bet the Japs are attacking . Jesus , recon is gon na get caught right in the middle of it . " " I guess we 're lucky , " Roth said . Minetta 's voice was very low . " Yeah , I du n no . Being doubled up on guard ai n't so good either . Wait , you 'll see . Three hours on a night like this is enough to make you flip your lid . How do we know that the Japs wo n't break through , and before your shift is over they 'll be attacking right here ? We 're only ten miles from the front . Maybe they 'll have a patrol out here . " " This is serious , " Roth said . He remembered the way Goldstein 's face had looked when he was making his pack soon after the storm . Goldstein was up there now , seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He might even be killed . Any of them ? Red , Gallagher , SergeantCroft , Wyman , Toglio , or Martinez or Ridges or Wilson ; they113were all up there now , right in the middle of it . Any one of them could be gone by tomorrow . It was horrible the way a man could be killed . He wanted to tell Minetta some of this . But Minetta yawned . " Jeez , I 'm glad this is over . " He started to go and then turned back . " You know who you wake up ? " " Sergeant Brown ? " " That 's right . He 's sleeping on a blanket with Stanley over there . " Minetta indicated the direction vaguely . Roth muttered , " Just five of us on this part of the perimeter . Think of it , five men having to hold down a whole platoon 's part of the perimeter . " " That 's what I mean , " Minetta said . " We ai n't getting any break . At least there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He yawned quietly . " Well , I 'm going , " he said . Roth felt terribly alone after Minetta left him . He gazed into the jungle , and got into the hole behind the machine gun as silently as he could . Something like this was beyond him , he told himself ; he did n't have the nerves for it . This took a younger man , a kid like Minetta or Polack , or one of the veterans . He was sitting on two cartridge boxes , and the handles cut into his bony rump . He kept shifting his weight , and moving his feet about . The hole was very muddy from the evening storm , and everything about him felt damp . His clothes had been wet for hours , and he had had to spread his blankets on the wet ground . What a way to live ! He would have a cold by morning , he was certain . He 'd be lucky if it was n't pneumonia . Everything was very quiet . The jungle was hushed , ominous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited , and abruptly the utter vacuum was broken and he was conscious of all the sounds of the night woods ? the crickets and frogs and lizards thrumming in the brush , the soughing of the trees . And then the sounds seemed to vanish , or rather his ear could hear only the silence ; for several minutesthere was a continual alternation between the sounds and the quiet , as if they were distinct and yet related like a drawing of some cubes which perpetually turn inside-out and back again . Roth began to think ; there was some heavy thunder and lightning in the distance , 114but he did not worry about the threat of rain . For a long time he listened to the artillery , which sounded like a great muffled bell in the heavy moist night air . He shivered and crossed his arms . He was rememberingwhat a training sergeant had said about dirty fighting and how the Japs would sneak up behind a sentry in the jungle and knife the man . " He 'd never know at all , " the sergeant had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was too late . " Roth felt a gnawing , guttish fear , and turned around to look at the ground behind him . He shuddered , brooding over such a death . What an awful thing to happen . His nerves were taut . As he tried to see the jungle beyond the little clearing past the barbed wire , he had the kind of anxiety and panic a child has when the monster creeps up behind the hero in a horror movie . Something clattered in the brush , and Roth ducked in his hole , and then slowly peeked above it , trying to discern a man or at least some recognizable object in the deep shapes and shadows of the jungle . The noise stopped , and then after ten seconds began again . It was a scratching urgent sound , and Roth sat numbly in the hole , feeling nothing but the beat of his pulse throughouthis entire body . His ears had become giant amplifiers and he was detecting a whole gamut of sounds , of sliding and scraping , of twigs cracking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . He bent over the machine gun , and then realized that he did n't know whether Minetta had cocked it completely or left it half-loaded . It meant that he would have to pull back the bolt and release it in order to be certain , and he was terrified of the noise it would make . He took up his rifle , and tried to loose the safety lever quietly , but it clicked into place quite audibly . Roth flinched at the noise , and then gazed into the jungle , trying to locate the particular place from which the sounds were coming . But they seemed to originate everywhere , and he had no idea of their distance and what caused them . He heard somethingrustle , and he turned his rifle clumsily in that direction , and waited , the sweat breaking out on his back . For an instant he was tempted to shoot , blindly and furiously , but he remembered that that , was very dangerous . " Maybe they do n't see me either , " he thought , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire was for fear of what Sergeant Brown would say . " If you fire without seeing anything115to aim at , you just give away the position of your hole , and they 'll throw a grenade in on you , " Brown had told him . Roth trembled . He was beginning to feel resentful ; for some time he had been convinced that the Japs were watching him . Why do n't you come on ? he wondereddesperately . By now his nerves were so taut that he would have welcomed an attack . He pressed his feet into the thick mud of the hole , and , still looking into the jungle , picked some mud off his boots with one hand and began to knead it like a piece of clay . He was unconscious of doing this . His neck had begun to pain him from the tension with which he held himself . It seemed to him that the hole was terribly open and that there was not enough protection . He felt bitter that a man should have to stand guard in an open hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a frantic scuffling behind the first wall of jungle and Roth ground his jaws together to keep from uttering a sound . The noises were coming closer like men creeping up , moving a few feet and then halting , before approaching another few feet . He fumbled around the tripod of the machine gun to find a grenade , and then held it in his hand wondering where to throw it . The grenade seemed extremelyheavy , and he felt so weak that he doubted if he could hurl it more than ten yards . In training he had been told the effective range of a grenade was thirty-five yards , and he was afraid now that he would be killed by his own grenade . He replaced it beneath the machinegun , and just sat there . His fear had to ebb after a time . For perhaps half an hour he had been waiting for the noises to develop into something , and when nothing occurred , his confidence began to come back . He did not reasonthat if there were laps they might spend two hours in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear the suspense , a part of him assumed that they could not either , and he became convinced there was nothing in the jungle but some animals scurrying about . He lay back in the hole with his shirt against the damp rear wall , and began to relax . His nerves calmed slowly , rousing to a pitch of fear again every time some sudden noise came out of the jungle , but still becoming more and more composed like a receding tide . After an hour had passed he grew sleepy . He thought of nothing , listened only to the116profound pendant silence of the wood . A mosquito began to sing about his ears and his neck , and he waited for it to bite him so that he could crush it . It made him think that there might be insects in the hole with him , and his body began to crawl , and for a few moments he was certain an ant was traveling down his back . It recalled to him the roaches that had infested the first apartment he had had when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " There 's nothing to worry about , Zelda . I can tell you from my studies that the roach is not too vicious a pest . " Zelda had got some idea that there must be bedbugs also , and no matter how many times he reassured her , " Zelda , roaches eat bedbugs , " she would start up in bed , and grasp him with fear , " Herman , I know there 's something biting me . " " But I tell you that 's impossible . " " Do n't tell me about your roaches , " she would whisper angrily in the darkened bedroom . " If roaches take care of bedbugs they have to get into the bed to do it , do n't they ? " Roth felt a mingled pleasure and wistfulness in remembering . Their life together had not been all that he had hoped . There were so many fights , and Zelda had a cruel tongue ; he recalled'how she had taunted him with his education and the fact that he could make no money . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but then it had not been his either . No one was to blame . It was just that you did n't get everything you had hoped for when you were a kid . He wiped his hands on his fatigue trousers with a slow thorough motion . Zelda had been a good wife in some ways . Their quarrels had become as difficult for him to remember as her face . He mused about her now , and in his mind she became another woman , many women . He began to constructa lewd fantasy in his mind . Roth dreamt he was taking pornographic pictures of a model whom he had dressed as a cowgirl . She was wearing a ten-gallon hat , and a leather fringe about an inch wide across her- breasts , and a leather holster and cartridge belt slung at an angle across her hips . He imagined now that he was telling her which way to pose and she was obeying with a tantalizing insouciance . His groin began to ache , and he sat there , brooding , dreaming . After a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it. 117Some artillery was firing steadily a mile or two away , the sounds loud , then muffled , then loud again . It gave him a secure feeling . He hardly listened any longer to the jungle- His eyes kept closing , remaining shut for many seconds while he yawed away on the edge of slumber . Several times he was about to fall asleep when a sudden noise in tht jungle would rouse him with a start . He looked at the luminous dial of his watch and realized with dismay that he had still an hour of guard . He lay back , closed his eyes with the full intention of opening them in a few seconds , and fell asleep . It was the last he remembered until he awoke almost two hours later . It had begun to rain once more , and the gentle drizzle had soaked his fatigues and penetrated to the insides of his shoes . He sneezed miserably once , and then realized with dismay how long he had been asleep . " A Jap could have killed me , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shudders through his body . He got out of the foxhole and stumbled over toward where Brown was sleeping . He would have missed him but he heard Brown whisper , " What the hell are you thrashing around for like a pig in the brush ? " Roth was meek . " I could n't find you , " he whined . " Hell of a note , " Brown said . He stretched once in his blankets , and stood up . " I could n't sleep , " he said . " Too many goddam noises . . What time is it ? " " After three-thirty . " " You were supposed to wake me at three . " Roth had been afraid of this . " I began to think , " Roth said weakly , " and lost track of the time . " " Shit ! " Brown said . He finished tying his shoes and walked out to the emplacement without saying anything else . Roth stood still for a moment , his rifle strap chafing his shoulder , and then began looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night . Minetta had pulled the blankets over him , and Roth lay down beside him gingerly , and tried to tug them away . At home he had always insisted on having the sheets tucked in tightly ; now with the blankets drawn up over his feet he was miserable . Everythingseemed wet . The rain kept falling on his exposed legs and he became very chilled . The blankets were midway between sopping and118damp ; they had a musty wet odor which reminded him of the smell of feet . He kept turning over , trying to find an accommodating place on the ground , but it seemed as if a root were always sticking into the small of his back . The drizzle teased him when he pulled the blankets off his face . He was sweating and shuddering at the same time , and he was convinced he would be sick . Why did n't I tell Brown he ought to be glad I stood an extra half hour of guard for him ? he asked himself abruptly , and felt frustrated and bitter that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell him in the morning , he assured himself angrily . Of the men in the platoon he decided there was not one of them he really liked . They 're all stupid , he said to himself . There was n't a single one of them who was the least bit friendly to a new man , and he felt a spasm of loneliness . His feet were cold . When he tried to wriggle his toes , the hopelessness of warming them overwhelmed him . He tried to think of his wife and son and it seemed to him there could be no more perfect life than to return to them . His wife had a soft mothering look now in her eyes , and his son was staring at him with delight and respect . He thought of his son growing up , discussing serious things with him , valuing his opinion . The drizzle tickled his ear , and he pulled the end of the blanket over his head again . Minetta'sbody was warm and he huddled toward it . He thought once again of his infant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks I 'm someone , Roth said to himself . I 'll show them yet . His eyes closed and he loosed a long whispering sigh , immensely wistful in the soft drizzling night . That fuggin Roth , Brown said to himself , falling asleep on guard and maybe getting us all killed . No man 's got a right to do something like that ; he lets his buddies down and they ai n't a worse thing a man can do . No , sir , Brown repeated , they ai n't a worse thing a man can do . I may be afraid and I may have my nerves shot all to hell , but at least I act like a sergeant and take care of my duties . There 's no easy way to get ahead ; a man 's got to pull his share , take his responsibilities , and then he gets what he earns . I 've had my eye on Roth from the beginning . He 's no good , he 's lazy , he 's shiftless , and he do n't take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitch because they finally119got caught . Hell , what about us who been sweating it out for a couple of years and Lord knows how long to come ? We were fightin ' when they were screwin ' their wives , and maybe screwin ' ours too . Brown shifted his weight angrily on the cartridge boxes and looked out at the jungle , rubbing his hand reflectively over the bridge of his short snubbed nose . Yeah , what about us , he said to himself , sitting out here in a lousy hole in the rain , sweatin ' out every goddam noise while those women are on the loose havin ' their own sweet time ? I should have known better , marrying a two-timing bitch like that . Even when we were in high school , she was rubbing up against everything that wore pants . Oh , I know a lot more now , I know that it 's a mistake to marry a woman ' cause you ca n't make her any other way , holding out on me for all that time , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There ai n't any such thing as a clean decent woman any more , when a man 's sister will go up to him and tell him to mind his own business because she 's fooling around and her husband 's out of town , it 's time for a man to open his eyes . There ai n't a one of them a man can trust out of his sight ; how many times have I picked up a iece lall act . a married woman with kids , it 's disgustin ' the way they Brown took his rifle off his knees and laid it against the machine gun . It 's bad enough with all a man 's got to worry about out here , with guys like that fuggin Roth who fall asleep on guard , and trying to keep the details straight so no man has to work more than his share , and always wondering if today is the day you get it , so that you 'd think a woman would have the decency to keep her legs closed , but , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a snowball in hell . All the time we 're out here beating our meat for company , doing it till it 's disgusting , but what the hell else is there ? I ought a quit ' cause it breaks down your confidence , and I 'd be feeling stronger , but how can ya without a goddam woman and nothing to think about ? All the men do it . Sure . Andnd right now what is she doing , she 's probably right in bed talking to a guy this very minute and they 're figuring out what they 're gon na do with the ten thousand insurance on me when I get knocked off . Well , I 'm gon na fool them , I 'm Gon na live through the oddatrg 12e 121war and then I 'm gon na get rid of her , and then I 'm gon na make my mark . There 'll be a lot of ways for a man to make some money after the war if he is n't afraid of some hard work and taking on some responsibility , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a good noncom . I may not be as good a scout as Martinez and I may not have ice instead of blood in my veins the way Croft has , but I 'm fair , and I take my job seriously . I 'm not like Red , always goofing off , or thinkin ' of a smart crack instead of working , I really try hard to be a good noncom ' cause if you succeed in the Army there is n't any other place you wo n't succeed . If you have to do something you might as well do it right , that 's what I believe . Some artillery fired continuously for several minutes , and Brown listened to it tensely . The boys are really getting it now , he told himself , sure as hell , the Japs are attacking and recon 's bound to be in the middle of it . We 're a hard-luck platoon , there 's no doubt about it , I just hope nobody gets hurt tonight . He stared into the darkness . I 'm real lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure glad I 'm not in Martinez 's shoes . It 's going to be real rough tonight , and I do n't want my part of it . I 've had my share of the close ones , running across a field with a machine gun ticking after me or swimming in the water that time the Japs had the AA gun turned on us is enough for any man to have to take . I 'm proud I 'm a sergeant , but there are times when I wish I was just a buck private and all I had to do was bitch like Roth . I 've got to look out for myself because no one else will , and I 've sweated this war out long enough not to get hit now . He fingered one of the jungle ulcers on his mouth . I just hope to I cell none of the boys get hurt tonight , he said to himself . The truck convoy ground sullenly through the mud . It was ovei in hour since recon had left its bivouac area , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truck and , since there were seats for only twelve , over half the men sat on the floor in a angle of rifles and packs and arms and legs . In the darkness everyone was sweating and the night seemed incomparably dense ; the jungle on either side of the road exuded moisture continually . No one had anything to say . W hen the men in the truck listenedthey could hear the front of the convoy grinding up a grade before them . Occasionally the truck to their rear would creep up close enough for the men to see its blackout lights like two tiny candles in a fog . A mist had settled over the jungle , and in the darkness the men felt disembodied . Wyman was sitting on his pack , and when he closed his eyes and let the rumble of the truck shake through him he felt as if he were in a subway . The tension and excitement he had felt when Croft had come up and told them to pack their gear because they were moving forward had abated a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which vacillated between boredom and a passive stream of odd thoughts and recollections . He was thinking of a time when he had accompanied his mother on a bus trip from New York to Pittsburgh . It was just after his father died , and his mother was going to see her relatives for money . The trip had been fruitless and , coming back on a midnight bus , he and his mother had talked about what they would do and decided that he would have to go to work . He thought of it with a little wonder . At the time it had been the most important night of his life , and now he was going on another trip , a far more eventful one , and he had no idea what would happen . It made him feel very mature for a moment ; these were things which had happened just a few years ago , insignificant things now . He was trying to imagine what combat would be like , and he decided it would be impossible to guess . He had always pictured it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And here he had been in the platoon for over a week and nothing had happened ; everything had been peaceful and relaxed . " Do you think we 'll see much tonight , Red ? " he asked softly . " Ask the General , " Red snorted . He liked Wyman , but he tried to be unfriendly to him because the youth reminded Red of Hennessey . Red had a deep loathing of the night before them . He had been through so much combat , had felt so many kinds of terror , and had seen so many men killed that he no longer had any illusions about the inviolability of his own flesh . He knew he could be killed ; it was something he had accepted long ago , and he had grown a shell about that knowledge so that he rarely thought of anything further ahead122than the next few minutes . However , there had been lately a disquietinguncomfortable insight which he had never brought to the point of words , and it was bothering him . Until Hennessey had been killed , Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as something large and devastating and meaningless . Men who were killed were merely men no longer around ; they became confused with old friends who had gone to the hospital and never come back , or men who had been transferred to another outfit . When he heard of some man he knew who had been killed or wounded badly , he was interested , even a little concerned , but it was the kind of emotion a man might feel if he learned that a friend of his had got married or made or lost some money . It was merely something that happened to somebody he knew , and Red had always let it go at that . But Hennessey 's death had opened a secret fear . It was so ironic , so obvious , when he remembered the things Hennessey had said , that he found himself at the edge of a bottomless dread . Once he could have looked ahead to what he knew would be bad combat with a repugnance for the toil and misery of it , and a dour acceptance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death was fresh and terrifying again . " You want to know something ? " he said to Wyman . " Yeah ? " " They ai n't a thing you can do about it , so shut up . " Wyman was hurt and lapsed into silence . Red felt sorry immediatelyafterward , and drew out a bar of tropical chocolate , bent out of shape and covered with tobacco grains from the silt of his pockets . " Hey , you want some chocolate ? " he asked . " Yeah , thanks . " They felt the night about them . In the truck there was no sound except for an occasional mutter or curse as they hit a bump . Each vehicle by itself was making all the noises that trucks can make ; they creaked and jounced and groaned over the bogholes , and their tires made wet singing sounds . But , taken all together , the line of trucks had a combined , intricate medley of vibrations and tones which sounded like the gentle persistent lapping of surf against the sides of a ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the darkness , the men123rsprawled uncomfortably on the floor , their backs propped against the knees of the man behind them , their rifles pitched at every odd angle or straddled clumsily across their knees . Croft had insisted they wear their helmets , and Red was sweating under the unaccustomed weight . " Might as well wear a goddam sandbag , " he said to Wyman . Encouraged , Wyman asked , " I guess it 's gon na be rough , huh ? " Red sighed , but repressed his annoyance . " It wo n't be too bad , kid . You just keep a tight ass-hole , and the rest of you 'll take care of itself . " Wyman laughed quietly . He liked Red , and decided he would stay near him . The trucks halted , and the men moved around inside , shifting their positions and groaning as they flexed their cramped limbs . They waited patiently , their heads dropping on their chests , their damp clothing unable to dry in the heavy night air . There was barely a breeze and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fidget . After the trucks had remained motionless for five minutes , he turned to Croft and asked , " Sergeant , is it all right if I get out and take a look at what 's holding us up ? " Croft snorted . " You can stay right here , Goldstein . They ai n't none of us gon na be getting up and getting lost on purpose . " Goldstein felt himself flush . " I did n't mean anything like that , " he said . " I just thought it might be dangerous for us to be sitting here like this when there might be Japs around . How do we know why the trucks stopped ? " Croft yawned and then lashed him in a cold even voice . " I tell you what , you 're going to have enough things to worry about . Suppos you just set down and beat your meat if you 're gettin ' anxious . I 'll dt all the goddam masterminding . " There was a snicker from some of the men in the truck , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he brooded over all the sarcastic things Croft had said to him since he had been in the platoon . The trucks started again , and moved jerkily in low gear for a few hundred yards before they stopped . Gallagher swore . " What 's the matter , boy , you in any hurry ? " Wilson asked softly . " We might as well get where we 're goin ' . " They remained sitting there for a few minutes , and then began124to move again . A battery they had passed on the road was firing , and another one a few miles ahead also had gone into action . The shells whispered overhead , perhaps a mile above them , and the men listeneddully . A machine gun began to fire far away , and the sound carried to them in separate bursts , deep and empty , like a man beating a carpet . Martinez took off his helmet and kneaded his skull , feeling as though a hammer were pounding him . A Japanese gun answered fire with a high penetrating shriek . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them to see one another . Their faces lookedwhite and then blue as though they were staring at each other across a1 11 dark and smoky room . " We 're gettin ' close , " someone said . After theflare had died , it was possible to see a pale haze against the horizon , and Toglio said , " Something 's burning . " " Sounds like a big fight going on , " Wyman suggested to Red . " Naw , they 're just feeling each other out , " Red told him . " There ' 11 be a helluva lot more noise if something starts tonight . " The machine guns sputtered and then became silent . A few mortar shells were landing somewhere with a flat thudding sound , and another machine gun , much farther away , fired again . Then there was silence , and the trucks continued down the black muddy road . After a few minutes they halted again , and somebody in the rear of the truck tried to light a cigarette . " Put the goddam thing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platoon and he swore at Croft . " Who the hell are you ? I 'm tired of just waiting around . " " Put that goddam thing out , " Croft said again , and after a pause , the soldier snuffed it . Croft was feeling irritable and nervous . He had no fear but he was impatient and overalert . Red debated whether to light a cigarette . He and Croft had hardly spoken to each other since their quarrel on the beach , and he was tempted to defy him . Actually he knew he would n't , and he tried to decide whether the real reason was that it was a bad idea to show a light or because he was afraid of Croft . Fug it , I 'll stand up to that sonofabitch when the time comes , Red told himself , but I 'll damn sure be right when I do . They had begun to move once more . After a few minutes they deleted linesToglio thought of a story he had read once , The Man Without a Country . Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think some things are n't fit for kidding , " he said severely . " You want to know something ? " Toglio knew a crack was coming , but against his judgment he asked , " What ? " " The only thing wrong with this Army is it never lost a war . " Toglio was shocked . " You think we ought to lose this one ? " Red found himself carried away . " What have I got against the goddam Japs ? You think I care if they keep this fuggin jungle ? What 's it to me if Cummings gets another star ? " " General Cummings , he 's a good man , " Martinez said . " There ai n't a good officer in the world , " Red stated . " They 're just a bunch of aristocrats , they think . General Cummings is no better than I am . His shit do n't smell like ice cream either . " Their voices were beginning to carry above a whisper , and Croft said , " Let 's keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was always the men who never got anywhere that did the bitching . Goldstein was still quivering . His sense of shame was so intense that a few tears welled in his eyes . Red 's interruption frustrated him , for Gallagher 's words had pitched Goldstein so taut that he needed some issue desperately now . He was certain , however , that he would start weeping with rage if he opened his mouth , and so he remained silent , trying to calm himself . A soldier came walking toward them . " Are you guys recon ? " he asked . " Yeah , " Croft said . " Okay , you want to follow me ? " They picked up their packs and began walking through the darkness . It was difficult to see the man ahead . After they had gone a few hundred feet , the soldier who was leading them halted and said , " Wait here . " Red swore . " Next time , let 's do it by the numbers , " he said . Cannoncompany fired again , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and muttered , " Some poor sonsofbitches are gon na catch hell in ' bout half a minute . " He sighed and sat down on the wetground . " You 'd think they had somepin better to do than have a whole squad of men walkin ' around all night . Ah ca n't make up m ' mind if Ah 'm hot or cold . " There was a wet heavy mist over the ground , and alternately they shivered in their wet clothing and swelteredin the airless night . Some Japanese artillery was landing about a mile away , and they listened to it quietly . A platoon of men filed by , their rifles clanking against their helmetsand pack buckles . A flare went up a short distance away , and in its light the men looked like black cutouts moving past a spotlight . Their rifles were slung at odd angles , and their packs gave them a humped misshapen appearance . The sound of their walking was confused and intricate ; like the truck convoy , it resembled the whisper of surf . Then the flare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were some distance away , the only sound that still remained was the soft metallic jingle of their rifles . A skirmish had started at some distanceand Jap rifles were firing . Red turned to Wyman and said , " Listento them . Tick-boom , tick-boom . You ca n't miss it . " A few Americanrifles answered , their fire sounding more powerful , like a leather belt slapped on a table . Wyman shifted uneasily . " How far away do you figure the Japs are ? " he asked Croft . " Damned if I know . You 'll see ' em soon enough , boy . " " Hell he will , " Red said . " We 're going to be sitting around allnight . " Croft spat . " You would n't mind that , would you , Valsen ? " " Not me . I 'm no hero , " Red said . Some soldiers walked past in the darkness , and a few trucks pulled into the bivouac . Wyman lay down on the ground . He was a little chagrined that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' fall asleep . The water soaked through his shirt , which was already wet , and he sat up again , shivering . The air was very sultry . He wished lie could light a cigarette . They waited another half hour before receiving the - order to move . Croft stood up and followed their guide while the rest trailed behind . The guide led them into a patch of brush where a platoon of men was grouped around six antitank guns . They were 37s , small guns about six feet long with very slender barrels . One man could129128pull one gun without too much difficulty over level hard ground . " We 're going along with antitank up to First Battalion , " Croft said . " We got to pull two of them guns . " Croft told them to gather around him . " I do n't know how muddy the damn trail is going to be , " he began , " but it ai n't too hard to guess . We 're going to be in the middle of the column , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men each , and they 'll be one group restin ' all the time . I 'll take Wilson and Gallagher , and Martinez can take Valsen and Ridges , and Toglio , you got what 's left ? Goldstein and Wyman . We 're scrapin ' the barrel , " he added dryly . He went up to talk to an officer for a few seconds . When he came back , he said , " We 'll let Toglio 's group have the first rest . " He got behind one of the guns and gave it a tug . " The sonofabitch is going to be heavy . " Wilson and Gallagher started pulling it with him , and the other platoon , which had already divided into a few men on each gun , began to move out . They tugged the guns across the bivouac area , and passed through a gap in the barbed wire where there was a machine gun emplacement . " Have a good time , men , " the man at the machine gun said . " Blow it out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his arms already . There were about fifty men in the column , and they moved very slowly down a narrow trail through the jungle . After they had moved a hundred feet , they were no longer able to see the men in front of them . The branches of the trees on either side of the trail joined overhead , and they felt as though they were groping through an endless tunnel . Their feet sank into the deep mud and , after a few yards , their boots were covered with great slabs of muck . The men on the guns would lunge forward for a few feet and then halt , lunge forward and halt . Every ten yards a gun would bog down and the three men assigned to it would have to tug until their strength seeped from their fingers . ' I hey would wrestle the gun out of its rut and plunge it forwardfor fifteen feet before their momentum was lost . Then they would pull it and lift it for another few yards until it sank into a hole once more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the trail . In the darkness they kept ganging up on each130other , the men on one gun sometimes riding it up onto the muzzle of the one ahead , or falling behind so far that the file at last broke into separate wriggling columns like a worm cut into many parts and still living . The men at the rear had the worst of it . The guns and men that preceded them had churned the trail until it was almost a marsh , and there were places where two teams would have to combine on one gun and carry it above the ground until they had passed the worst of the slime . The trail was only a few feet wide . Huge roots continually tripped the men , and their faces and hands became scratched and bleeding from the branches and thorns . In the complete darkness they had no idea of how the trail might bend , and sometimes on a down slope , when they could let the gun roll a little distance , they would land at the bottom with the field piece completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the brush , covering their eyes with their arms to protect them from the vines , and a painful struggle to bring the gun back on the path would begin . Some Japanese might easily have been waiting in ambush , but it was impossible to keep silent . The guns squeaked and lumbered , made sucking sounds as their tires sank into the mud , and the men swore helplessly , panted with deep sobbing sounds like wrestlers at the end of a long bout . Voices and commands echoed hollowly , were lost in a chorus of profanity and hoarse sobbing , the straining sweating noises of men in great labor . By the time an hour had passed , nothing existed for them but the slender cannon they had to get down the track . The sweat drenched their clothing and filled their eyes , blinding them . They grappled and blundered and swore , advanced the little guns a few feet at a time with no consciousness any longer of what they weredoing . When one team was relieved by another , they would stagger alongside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes to rest for a little while . Every ten minutes the column would stop to allow the stragglers to catch up . During the halts the men would sprawl in the middle of the trail not caring how the mud covered them . They felt as though they had been running for hours ; they could not regain their breath , and their stomachs retched emptily , 131Some of the men began to throw away their equipment ; one afte. another the men threw their helmets aside or dropped them on th trail . The air was unbearably hot under the canopy of the jungle , an . the darkness gave no relief from the heat of the day ; if anything , walkingthe trail was like fumbling through an endless closet stuffed with velvet garments . During one of the halts , the officer leading the file worked his way back to find Croft . " Where 's Sergeant Croft ? " he shouted , his words repeated by the men along the trail until it reached Croft . " Here , sir . " They stumbled toward each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the officer asked . " Okay . " They sat down beside the trail . " Mistake trying this , " the officer gasped . " Have to get through . " Croft , with his lean ropy body , had borne the labor comparatively well , but his voice was unsteady and he had to talk with short quick spates of words . " How far ? " he asked . " Have to go one mile ... one mile yet . More than halfway there , I think . Never should have tried it . " " They need the guns bad ? " The officer halted for a moment and tried to speak normally . " I think so . . . there 's no tank weapons there . . . up on the line . We stopped a tank attack two hours ago . . . at Third Battalion . Orders came to move some thirty-sevens over to First Battalion . Guess they expect attack there . " " Better get them through , " Croft said . He was contemptuous becausethe officer had to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do his own job . " Have to , I guess . " The officer stood up and leaned for a moment against a tree . " If you get a gun stuck , let me know . Have to cross a stream . . . up ahead . Bad place , I think . " He began to feel his way forward , and Croft turned around and worked his way back to the gun he was pulling . The column was over two hundred yards long by now . They started to move , and the labor continued . Once or twice a flare filtered a wan and delicate bluish light over them , the light almost lost in the dense foliage through which ithad to pass . In the brief moment it lasted , they were caught at their guns in classic straining motions that had the form and beauty of a frieze . Their uniforms were twice blackened , by the water and the ( lark slime of the trail . And for the instant the light shone on them their faces stood out , white and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an insect reared back on its wire haunches . Then darkness swirled about them again , and they ground the guns forward blindly , a line of ants dragging their burden back to their hole . They had reached that state of fatigue in which everything was hated . A man would slip in the mud and remain there , breathing hoarsely , having no will to get to his feet . That part of the column would halt , and wait numbly for the soldier to join them . If they had breath , they would swear . " Fug the sonofabitchin ' mud . " " Get up , " somebody would cry . " Fug you . Fug the goddam gun . " " Let me lay here . I 'm okay , they ai n't a thing wrong with me , I 'm okay , let me lay . " " Fug you , get up ! " And they would labor forward a few more yards and halt . In the darkness , distance had no meaning , nor did time . The heat had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damp night , and everything about them was sodden and pappy ; they stank but no longer with animal smells ; their clothing was plastered with the foul muck of the jungle mud , and a chill dank rotting smell somewhere between leaf mold and faeces filled their nostrils . They knew only that they had to keep moving , and if they thought of time it was in so many convulsions of nausea . Wyman was wondering why he did not collapse . His breath came in long parched shudders , his pack straps galled , his feet were ablaze , and he could not have spoken , for his throat and chest and mouth seemed covered with a woolly felt . He was no longer conscious of the powerful and fetid stench that rose from his clothes . Somewheredeep inside himself was a wonder at the exhaustion his body could endure . He was normally a sluggish youth who worked no more than he was obliged to , and the sensations of labor , the muscle strains , 133132the panting , the taste of fatigue were things he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about being a hero , assuming this would bring him some immense reward which would ease his life and remove the problems of supporting his mother and himself . He had a girl and he wanted to dazzle her with his ribbons . But he had always imagined combat as exciting , with no misery and no physical exertion . He dreamed of himself charging across a field in the face of many machine guns ; but in the dream there was no stitch in his side from running too far while bearing too much weight . He had never thought he would be chained to an inanimate monster of metal with which he would have to grapple until his arms trembled helplessly and his body was ready to fall ; certainly he had never imagined he would stumble down a path in the middle of the night with his shoes sucking and dragging in slime . He pushed at the gun , he lifted it with Goldstein and Toglio when it became mired in a hole , but the motions were automatic by now ; he hardly even felt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wheel hubs . His fingers were no longer able to close , and often he would tug helplessly until his hands slipped away with the gun still mired . The column was proceeding even more slowly than it had at the start , and sometimes fifteen minutes would elapse before a gun could be moved a hundred yards . Every now and then a man would faint , and would be left by the side of the trail to make his way back alone when he recovered . At last a message began to carry back along the trail , " Keep going , we 're almost there , " and for a few minutes it served as a stimulant so that the men labored with some hope again . But when each turning in the trail discovered only another ribbon of mud and darkness , the men began to feel a hopeless dejection . Sometimes for as much as a minute they would not move at all . It became harder and harder to pitch themselves against the guns again . Every time they stopped they felt like quitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few hundred feet before they reached 1st Battalion , and its banks sloped very steeply down to a little stony brook , then ascended again abruptly to about fifteen feet above the bottom . This was the stream the officer had mentioned. 134When the men reached it , the column stopped completely , and the stragglers caught up . Each team of soldiers waited for the men and gun in front of them to cross the stream . In the night it was an extremelydifficult business at best and took a long time . The men would go sliding down the bank trying to restrain their field piece from turning over at the bottom , and then they would have to lift it over the slippery rocks of the brook before attempting to wrestle it up the other side . The banks were slimy , and there was no foothold ; time and again a team would force their gun up almost to the top of the draw only to slip back again futilely . By the time Wyman and Toglio and Goldstein had to move their gun , a half hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind had returned and they kept shouting instructions to each other as they nosed the gun over the edge of the bank . It began to pull away from them , and they had to resist desperately to keep it from crashing to the bottom . The exertion drained most of the strength they had recovered , and after they had carried the piece across the stream , they were as exhaustedas they had been at any time during the march . They stopped for a few moments to gather whatever force was left in them and began the struggle up the bank . Toglio was wheezinglike a bull , and his commands had a hoarse urgent sound as if he were wrenching them from deep inside his body . " Okay , PUSH . . . PUSH , " he growled , and the three of them strove numbly to roll the gun . It resisted them , moved sluggishly and treacherously , and the strength began to flow out of their trembling legs . " HOLD IT ! " Toglioshouted " DO N'T LET IT SLIP ! " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet into the wet clay of the bank . " PUSH AGAIN ! " he shouted , and they forced it upward a few more feet . Wyman felt a band was stretching dangerously inside his body , and would snap at any moment . They rested again , and then shoved the gun another few yards . Slowly , minute by minute , they came closer to the top . They were perhaps four feet from the crest when Wyman lost the last reserves of his strength . He tried to draw some few shreds of effort from his quivering limbs , but he seemed to collapse all at once , and just lay stupidly behind the gun supporting it with no more than the weight of his sagging body . The gun began to slip , and he135pulled away . Toglio and Goldstein were left at each of the hubs . When Wyman let go , they felt as though someone were pushing down against the gun . Goldstein held on until the sliding wheels pulled his fingers loose , one by one , and then he just had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Toglio , before the gun went crashing down to the bottom . The three men fell after it , rolling in its wake . The gun struck some rocks at the bottom , and one of the wheels was knocked completelyawry . They felt for it in the darkness like pups licking the wounds of their mother . Wyman began to blubber with exhaustion . The accident caused a great deal of confusion . Croft 's team was on the gun waiting behind them , and he began to shout , " What 's holdin ' you up ? What 's happening down there ? " " We had . . . trouble , " Toglio shouted back . " Wait ! " He and Goldstein succeeded in turning the gun on its side . " The wheel 's shot . " Toglio shouted . " We ca n't move the gun . " Croft swore . " Get her out of the way . " They tried , and could n't budge it . " We need help , " Goldstein shouted . Croft swore again , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while they were able to tumble the gun over enough times to move it down the creek bed . Without saying anything , Croft went back to his gun , and Toglio and the others climbed up the far bank and went staggering down the trail till they reached 1st Battalion 's bivouac . The men who had arrived before them were lying on the ground motionless . Toglio stretched out in the mud , and Wyman and Goldstein lay down beside him . None of them spoke for ten minutes . Occasionally , a shell might burst somewhere in the jungle about them and their legs might twitch , but this was the only sign they gave of being conscious . Men were moving about constantly , and the sounds of the fighting were closer , more vicious . Voices kept coming to them out of the darkness . Someone would shout , " Where 's the pack train for B Company ? " and the answer would be muffled to the men lying on the ground . They hardly cared . Occasionally they would be aware of the sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrate on the constant thrumming that emanated from the jungle , but they always relapsed into a stupor , thinking of nothing once more. 136Croft and Wilson and Gallagher brought their gun in a short while later , and Croft shouted for Toglio . " What do you want ? I 'm here , " Toglio said . He hated to move . Croft came toward him in the darkness and sat down beside him . l-is breath was coming in long slow gasps like a runner after a race . " I 'm going to see the Lieutenant . . . tell him about the gun . How the hell did it happen ? " Toglio propped himself on an elbow . He loathed the explanationsthat were to come , and he was confused . " I do n't know , " he said . " I heard Goldstein yell ' Watch out ' and then it just seemed to rip out of our hands . " Toglio hated to give excuses to Croft . " Goldstein yelled , huh ? " Croft asked . " Where is he ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's voice came out of the darknessbeside them . " Why 'd you yell ' Watch out ' ? " " I do n't know . I felt suddenly as if I could n't hold it any more . Something pulled it away from me . " " Who was the other man ? " Wyman roused himself . " I guess I was . " His voice soundedweak . " Did you let go ? " Croft asked . Wyman felt a trace of fear as he thought of admitting that to Croft . " No , " he said . " No , I do n't think so . I heard Goldstein yell , and then the gun started to come down on me . It was rolling back so I got out of the way . " Already he was uncertain exactly how it had occurred , and a part of his mind was trying to convince him that he spoke the truth . With it , however , he felt a surprising flush of shame . " I guess it was my fault , " he blurted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it lacked sincerity , and Croft thought he was trying to protectGoldstein . " Yeah , " Croft said . A spasm of rage worked through him , and he turned on Goldstein and said , " Listen , Izzy . " " My name is n't Izzy , " Goldstein said angrily . " I do n't give a damn what it is . The next time you pull a goddam trick like that , I 'm going to put you in for a court-martial . " " But I do n't think I let go , " Goldstein protested weakly . By now , 137he too was no longer sure . The sequence of his sensations when the gun had begun to pull out of his hands was too confused for him to feel righteous . He had thought that Wyman stopped pushing first , but when Wyman declared he was to blame , Goldstein had a moment of panic . Like Croft , he believed Wyman was protecting him . " I do n't know , " he said . " I do n't think I did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him off . " Listen , for as long as you 've been in the platoon , Goldstein , you 've done nothing but have ideas about how we could do something better . But when it comes down to a little goddam work , you 're always dicking off . I 've had enough of that bullshit from you . " Once again Goldstein was feeling a helpless anger . A reaction he could not control , his agitation was even greater than his resentment and choked him so that he could not speak . A few tears of frustration welled in his eyes , and he turned away and lay down again . His anger was now directed toward himself and he felt a hopeless shame . Oh , I do n't know , I do n't know , he said . Toglio had a mingled relief and pity . He was glad the onus of losing the gun was not his , and yet he was unhappy anyone should be blamed . The bond of common effort that the three men had known while struggling with the weapon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , poor Goldstein , he 's a good guy ; he just had hard luck . Wyman was too exhausted to think clearly . After he declared it was his fault , he was relieved to discover he was not to be blamed after all . He was actually too depleted to think consecutively about anything , or indeed remember anything . By now , he was convinced it was Goldstein who had deserted the gun , and his main reaction was one of comfort . The image still most vivid to him was the agony he had felt in his chest and groin as they had started up the embankment , and he thought , I would have let go two seconds later if he did n't . For this reason , Wyman felt a dulled sense of affection for Goldstein . Croft stood up . " Well , that 's one gun they ai n't going to rescue for a little while , " he said . " I bet it stays there for the whole campaign . " He was enraged enough to strike Goldstein . Without saying138anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the officer who had led the column . The men in the platoon settled down and began to sleep . Occasionallya shell would burst in the jungle nearby , but they hardly cared . The battle had been threatening all evening like a thunderstorm which never breaks , and by now it would have taken a barrage to move them . Besides , they were too weary to dig holes . It took Red longer to fall asleep than any of the others . For many years his kidneys had bothered him whenever he had too much exposureto dampness . They were throbbing now , and he turned several times on the wet ground , trying to decide if it would be less painful to sleep with his back against the moist earth or exposed to the night air . He lay awake for a long time thinking , his mood turning through a small gamut from weariness to sadness . He was thinking of a time when he had been caught in a small town in Nebraska with no jobs to be had , and had had to wait until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seemed very important to him then not to beg for something to eat , and he wondered if he still had that pride . " Oh , I 've been tough in my time , " he muttered to himself . " Lot of good it does me . " The air was cold on his back , and he turned over . It seemed to him that all his life he had been sleeping in bare wet places , seeking for warmth . He thought of an old hobo saying , " Half a buck in your pocket and wintercoming , " and felt some of the gloom he had known on cold Octobertwilights . His stomach was empty , and he got up after a while and rummaged through his pack . He found a K ration and chewed the fruit bar , washing it down with water from his canteen . His blanket was still wet from the evening storm , but he wrapped it about him and found a little warmth . Then he tried to go to sleep again , but his kidneys were aching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the firstaidkit on his cartridge belt , and withdrew the little paper bag of wound tablets . He swallowed half of them and drank about half the water remaining in his canteen . For a moment he thought of using them all , but then he remembered that he might be wounded and need them . It brought back his dejection , and he stared solemnly into the darkness , being able to discern after a time the bodies of the sleep-139ing men around him . Toglio was snoring , and he heard . Martinez muttersoftly in Spanish and then cry out , " I no kill Jap , God , I no kill him . " Red sighed and lay down again . - What men sleep easy ? he thought . A trace of an old anger passed through him . I do n't give a damn about anything , he said to himself , and listened uneasily to a shell sighing overhead . This time it sounded like the branches of a tree murmuringin a winter wind . He remembered once striding along a highwayas evening came . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he had watched the miners driving home in their battered Fords , their faces still dark with the day 's accumulation of soot and coal dust . It had not looked anything like the mining country in Montana he had left years before , and yet it had been the same . He had walked along brooding about home , and someone had given him a ride and treated him to a drink in a noisy bar . That night had a beauty about it now , and he remembered for a moment the sensation of leaving a strange town on a dark freight . Things like that were only glints of light in the long gray day of those years . He sighed again as if to grasp something of the knowledge he had felt for an instant . Nobody gets what he wants , he said to himself , and this deepenedhis mood of pleasurable sorrow . He was growing drowsy , and he burrowed his head under his forearm . A mosquito began to whine near his ear and he lay still , hoping it would go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little buggers are one thing I 'm used to , he thought . For some reason this made him smile . It was beginning to rain , and Red covered his head with the blanket . His body was slowly sinking into a weary slumber in which different parts of him fell asleep at separate intervals , so that long after he had stopped thinking , a portion of his mind could feel the quivering of an exhausted limb or a cramp in one of his limbs . The shelling was becoming steady , and a half mile away from him a machinegun kept firing . Almost asleep , he watched Croft return and spread out a blanket . The rain continued . After a time , he no longer heard the artillery . But even when he was completely asleep , one last area of his mind noticed what was happening . Although he did n't remember it when he awoke , he heard a platoon of men march by , and140was conscious of some other men beginning to push the antitank guns to the other side of the bivouac . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said in his sleep . They 're going to protect it now . Probably he was feverish . He dreamed until he heard a voice shout , " Recon ? Where 's recon ? " The dream ebbed away , and he lay there drowsily , listening to Croft spring to his feet and holler , " Here , over here ! " Red knew he would have to be moving in a few minutes , and he burrowed deeper into his blankets . His body ached and he knew that when he stood up he would be stiff . " All right , men , on your feet . " Croft was shouting . " Come on , get up , we got to move . " Red pulled the cover off his face . It was still raining and his hand came away wet from the top surface of the blanket . When he replaced the blanket in his pack , his pack also would become wet . " Aaaahhhhhrr . " He cleared his throat with disgust and spat once or twice . The taste in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groaned . " Goddam Army , why do n't they let a guy sleep ? Ai n't we done enough tonight ? " " We 're heroes , " Red said . He stood up and began to fold his blanket . It was sopping wet on one side and muddy on the other . He had slept with his rifle beside him , covered under the blanket , but it too was wet . Red wondered how long it had been since he was dry . " Fuggin jungle , " he said . " Come on , you men , snap it up , " Croft said . A flare lit the wet ugly shrubs about them and flickered dully against their wet black : lothing . Red saw that Gallagher 's face was covered with mud , and when he felt his own face , his hands came away soiled . " Show . ne the way to go home , " he hummed . " I 'm tired and I want to go to bed . " " Yeah , " Gallagher said . They made their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and they were blinded for a moment in the returning darkness . " Where we going ? " Toglio asked . " Up to A Company . They expect an attack there , " Croft said . " We sure are a hard-luck platoon , " Wilson sighed . " At least we 're done with them antitank guns . Ah swear Ah 'd fight a tank with mah bare hands ' fore Ah 'd rassle with one of them sonsofbitchesagain. " 141The squad formed a single file and began to move out . First Battalion'sbivouac was very small and in thirty seconds they had reached the gap in the barbed wire . Martinez led them cautiously down the trail leading to A Company . His drowsiness vanished quickly , and he became alert . Actually , he could not see anything , but some sense seemed to guide him along the bends in the path so that he rarely stumbled or blundered off the trail . He was proceeding about thirty yards ahead of the other men and he was completely isolated . If some Japanese had been waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first to be trapped . Yet he had very little fear ; Martinez 's terror developed in a void ; the moment he had to lead men , his couragereturned . At this instant , his mind was poised over a number of sounds and thoughts . His ears were searching the jungle ahead of him for some noise which might indicate that men were waiting in the brush beside the trail ; they were also listening with disgust to the stumbling and muttering of the men following behind him . His mind recorded the intermittent sounds of battle and tried to classify them ; he looked at the sky whenever they passed through a partial clearing in order to find the Southern Cross and determine in which direction the trail was bending . Wherever he could , he made a mental note of some landmark they were passing and added it to the ones he had observedpreviously . After a time he kept repeating a jingle to himself which went , Tree over trail , muddy creek , rock on trail , bushes across . Actually there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only from 1st Battalion to A Company . But this was a habit he had formed on his first patrols . He did it instinctively by now . And another part of his mind had a quiet pride that he was the man upon whom the safety of the others depended . This was a sustainingforce which carried him through dangers his will and body would have resisted . During the march with the antitank guns , there had been many times when he wanted to quit ; unlike Croft , he had felt it no contest at all . He would have been perfectly willing to declare the task beyond his strength and give up , but there was a part of his mind that drove him to do things he feared and detested . His pride with being a sergeant was the core about which nearly all his actions and thoughts were bound . Nobody see in the darkness like Martinez , 142he said to himself . He touched a branch before his extended arm and bent his knees easily and walked under it . His feet were sore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ills with which he no longer concerned himself ; he was leading his squad , and that was sufficient in itself . The rest of the squad , strung out behind , was experiencing a variety of emotions . Wilson and Toglio were sleepy , Red was alert and brooding ? he had a sense of foreboding . Goldstein was miser able and bitter , and the tension of creeping down a trail in the black early hours of the morning made him gloomy and then sad . He thought of himself dying without friends nearby to mourn him . Wymanhad lost his power to recuperate ; he was so tired that he plodded along in a stupor , not caring where he went or what happened to him . Ridges was weary and patient ; he did not think of what the next hours would bring him , nor did he lose himself in contemplation of his achinglimbs ; he just walked and his mind drifted slowly like a torpid stream . And Croft ; Croft was tense and eager and impatient . All night he had been balked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sounds of battle he had been hearing all night were goading to him . His mind was buoyed by a recurrence of the mood he had felt after Hennessey 's death . He felt strong and tireless and capable of anything ; his muscles were as strained and jaded as any of the men 's , but his mind had excluded his body . He hungered for the fast taut pulse he would feel in his throat after he killed a man . On the map there was only a half mile between 1st Battalion and A Company , but the trail doubled and curved so often that it was actually a mile . The men in recon were clumsy now and uncertain of their footing . Their packs sagged , their rifles kept sliding off their shoulders . The trail was crude ; originally a game wallow , it had been partially enlarged , and in places it was still narrow . A man could not walk without being scratched by the branches on either side . The jungle was impenetrable at that point , and it would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet off the path . In the night it was impossible to see anything and the smell of the wet foliage was choking . The men had to walk in single file , drawn up close . Even at three143feet they could not see one another , and they plodded down the trail with each man grasping the shirt of the man before him . Martinez could hear them and judge his distance accordingly , but the others stumbled and collided with one another like children playing a game lin the dark . They were bent over almost double , and the posture was cruel . Their bodies were outraged ; they had been eating and sleeping with no rhythm at all for the last few hours . They kept loosing gas whose smell was nauseating in the foul dense air . The men at the rear had the worst of it ; they gagged and swore , tried not to breathe for a few seconds , and shuddered from fatigue and revulsion . Gallagher was at the end of the file , and every few minutes he would cough and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would shout , and the men in front would rouse themselves for a moment and laugh . " Eatin ' dust , hey , boy , " Wilson muttered , and a few of them began to giggle . Some of them began to fall asleep as they walked . Their eyes had been closed almost the entire march , and they drowsed for the instant their foot was in the air and awakened as it touched the ground . Wyman had been plodding along for many minutes with no sensation at all ; his body had grown numb . He and Ridges drowsed continually , and every now and then for ten or fifteen yards they would be completely asleep . At last they would weave off the trail and go pitching into the bushes stupidly before regaining their balance . In the darkness such noises were terrifying . It made the men uncomfortablyaware of how close they were to the fighting . A half mile away some rifles were firing . " Goddammit , " one of them would whisper , " ca n't you guys keep quiet ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour , but after the first few minutes they no longer thought about time . Crouching and sliding through the mud with their hands on the man in front became the only thing they really knew ; the trail was a treadmill and they no longer concerned themselves with where they were going . To most of them the end of the march came as a surprise . Martinez doubled back and told them to be quiet . " They hear you coming for ten minutes , " he whispered . A hush settled over the men , and they trod the last144hundred yards with ridiculous precautions , tensing every muscle whenever they took a step . There was no barbed wire , nor any clearing at A Company . The trail divided in a quadruple fork which led to different emplacements . A soldier met them where the path broke up and led the squad along one of the footpaths to a few pup tents pitched in the middle of some foliage . " I got Second Platoon , " he told Croft . " I 'm just about a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these holes tonight , and set up a guard right along here . They 's two machine guns set up for you . " " What 's doing ? " Croft whispered . " I du n no . I heard they expect an attack all up and down the line about dawn . We had to send a platoon over to C Company early tonight , and we been holding down the whole outpost here with less than a platoon . " He made a rustling sound in the darkness as he wiped his hand against his mouth . " C'mere , I 'll show you the setup , " he said , grasping Croft 's elbow . Croft slipped his arm free ; he hated to have anyone touch him . They went a few feet along the path , until the sergeant from A Company halted before a foxhole . There was a machine gun mounted in front , its muzzle just projecting through a fringe of bushes . Croft peered through the foliage and in the faint moonlight was able to see a stream of water and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How deep is the river ? " he asked . " Aw , it 's four , five feet maybe . That water ai n't going to stop them . " " Any outposts forward of here ? " Croft asked . " Nothing . And the Japs know right where we are . Had some patrols up . " The . soldier wiped his mouth again and stood up . " I 'll show you the other machine gun . " They walked along a stubbly path cut through the jungle about ten feet from the river 's edge . Some crickets were chirping loudly , and the soldier trembled a little . " Here 's the other one , " he said . " This is the flank . " He peered through the bushes and stepped out onto the strip of beach . " Look , " he said . Croft followed him . About fifty yards to their right , the bluffs of Watamai Range began . Croft looked up . The cliffs rose almost verti-145cally for perhaps a thousand feet . Even in the darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes and thought he saw a swatch of sky where they ended but could not be certain . He had a curious thrill . " I did n't know we were that close , " he said . " Oh , yeah . It 's good and it 's bad . You do n't have to worry about them coming around that end , but still we 're the flank . If they ever hit here hard , there ai n't much to hold them . " The soldier drew into the bushes again and exhaled his breath slowly . " I 'll tell you these two nights we been out here give me the creeps . Look at that river . When there 's a-lot of moonlight it just seems to shine , and you get jittery after a while looking at it . " Croft remained outside the jungle edge , looking at the stream that curved away at the right and flowed parallel to the mountains . It took a turn toward the Japanese lines just a few yards before the first walls of the bluff began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that side . To the left the stream ran straight for a few hundred yards like a highway at night , sunk between high grassy banks . " Where are you ? " he asked . The soldier pointed to a tree which projected a little from the jungle . " We 're just on this side of it . If you got to get to us , go back to the fork and then take the trail at the far right going away from here . Yell ' Buckeye ' when you come up . " " Okay , " Croft said . They talked for a few more minutes , and then the other soldier hooked his cartridge belt . " Jesus , I 'll tell ya , it 'll drive ya crazy spending a night here . Just wilderness , that 's all , and you stuck out at the end of it with nothing but a lousy machine gun . " He slung his rifle and struck off down the trail . Croft looked at him for a moment and then went back to recon . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he showed them where the two machine guns were placed . Briefly he told them what he had learned and picked a guard . " It 's three A.M. now , " he told them . " There 's gon na be four of us on one post and five on the other . We 'll do it in two-hour shifts . Then the post that 's only got four men will get the extra one for the next time around . " He divided them up , taking the first shift at the flank gun himself . Wilson volunteered to take the other gun . " After Ah 'm done , Ah 'm gon na want to sleep right on through , " Wilson146said . " Ah 'm tired of gittin ' up right when Ah 'm havin ' a good dream . " The men smiled wanly . " An ' listen , " Croft added , " if any trouble starts , the men that are sleeping are to git up goddam fast and move to help us . It 's only a couple of yards from our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't much further to mine . It should n't be takin ' you all more than about three hours to reach us . " Again , a couple of men smiled . " Okay , that 's about it , " Croft said . He left them and walked over to his machine gun . He sat down on the edge of the hole and peered through the bushes at the river . The jungle completely surrounded him , and , now that he was no longer active , he felt very weary and a little depressed . To counteract this mood , he began to feel the various objects in the hole . There were three boxes of belt ammunition and a row of seven grenades lined up neatly at the base of the machine gun . At his feet were a box of flares and a flare gun . He picked it up and broke open the breech quietly , loaded it , and cocked it . Then he set it down beside him . A few shells murmured overhead and began to fall . He was a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the river . Not more than a few hundred yards away , the noise of their explosion was extremely loud ; a few pieces of shrapnel lashed the leaves on the trees above him . He broke off a stalk from a plant and put it in his mouth chewing slowly and reflectively . He guessed that the weapons , platoon of A Company had fired , and he tried to determine which trail at the fork would lead to them in case he had to pull back his men . Now he was patient and at ease ; the danger of their position neutralized the anticipation for some combat he had felt earlier , and he was left cool and calm and very tired . The mortar shells were falling perhaps fifty yards in front of the platoon at his left , and Croft spat quietly . It was too close to be merely harassing fire ; someone had heard something in the jungle on the other side of the river or they would never have called for mortars so close to their own position . His hand explored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up the receiver , listened 11147quietly . It was an open line , and probably confined to the platoons of A Company . Two men were talking in voices so low that he strained to hear them . " Walk it up another fifty and then bring it back . " " You sure there 're Japs ? " " I swear I heard them talking . " Croft stared tensely across the river . The moon had come out , and the strands of beach on either side of the stream were shining with a silver glow . The jungle wall on the other side looked impenetrable . The mortars fired again behind him with a cruel flat sound . He watched the shells land in the jungle , and then creep nearer to the river in successive volleys . A mortar answered from the Japanese side of the river , and about a quarter of a mile to the left Croft could hear several machine guns spattering at each other , the uproar deep and irregular . Croft picked up the phone and whistled into it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was no answer and he debated whether to walk over to Wilson 's hole . Silently Croft cursed him for not noticing the phone , and then berated himself for not having discoveredit before he briefed the others . He looked out across the river . Fine sergeant I am , he told himself . His ears were keyed to all the sounds of the night , and from long experience he sifted out the ones that were meaningless . If an animal rustled in its hole , he paid no attention ; if some crickets chirped , his ear disregarded them . Now he picked a muffled slithering sound which he knew could be made only by men moving through a thin patch of jungle . He peered across the river , trying to determine where the foliage was least dense . At a point between his gun and Wilson 's there was a grove of a few coconut trees sparse enough to allow men to assemble ; as he stared into that patch of wood , he was certain he heard a man move . Croft 's mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine gun , and he slowly brought it to bear on the coconut grove . The rustling grew louder ; it seemed as if men were creeping through the brush on the other side of the river to a point opposite his gun . Croft swallowed once . Tiny charges seemed to pulse through his limbs and his head was as empty and shockingly aware as if it hadbeen plunged into a pail of freezing water . He wet his lips and shifted his position slightly , feeling as though he could hear the flexing of his muscles . The Jap mortar fired again and he started . The shells were fallingby the next platoon , the sound painful and jarring to him . He stared out on the moonlit river until his eyes deceived him ; he began to think he could see the heads of men in the dark swirls of the current . Croft gazed down at his knees for an instant and then across the river again . He looked a little to the left or right of where he thought the Japanese might be ; from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly at an object and see it in the darkness . Somethingseemed to move in the grove , and a new trickle of sweat formed and 11,1111 rolled down his back . He twisted uncomfortably . Croft was unbearablytense , but the sensation was not wholly unpleasant . He wondered if Wilson had noticed the sounds , and then in answer to his question , there was the loud unmistakable clicking of a machine gun bolt . To Croft 's keyed senses , the sound echoed up and down the river , and he was furious that Wilson should have revealed his position . The rustling in the brush became louder and Croft was convinced he could hear voices whispering on the other side of the river . He fumbled for a grenade and placed it at his feet . Then he heard a sound which pierced his flesh . Someone called from across the river , " Yank , Yank ! " Croft sat numb . The voice wasthin and high-pitched , hideous in a whisper . " That 's a Jap , " Croft x1111 told himself . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " It was calling to him . " Yank . We you coming-to-get , Yank . " hlThe night lay like a heavy stifling mat over the river . Croft tried to breathe . " We you coming-to-get , Yank . " Croft felt as if a hand had suddenly clapped against his back , traveled up his spine over his skull to clutch at the hair on his forehead . " Coming to get you , Yank , " he heard himself whisper . He had the agonizing frustration of a man in a nightmare who wants to screamand can not utter a sound . " We you coming-To-get , Yank . " ! lHe shivered terribly for a moment , and his hands seemed con-149gealed on the machine gun . He could not bear the intense pressure in his head . " We you coming-to-get , Yank , " the voice screamed . " COME AND GET ME YOU SONSOFBITCHES , " Croft roared . He shouted with every fiber of his body as though he plunged at an oaken door . There was no sound at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river and the taut rapt buzzing of the crickets . Then the voice spoke again . " Oh , we come , Yank , we come . " Croft pulled back the bolt on his machine gun , and rammed it home . His heart was still beating with frenzy " Recon . . . RECON , UP ON THE LINE , " he shouted with all his strength . A machine gun lashed at him from across the river , and he ducked in his hole . In the darkness , it spat a vindictive white light like an acteylene torch , and its sound was terrifying . Croft was holding himself together by the force of his will . He pressed the trigger of his gun and it leaped and bucked under his hand . The tracers spewed wildly into the jungle on the other side of the river . But the noise , the vibration of his gun , calmed him . He directed it to where he had seen the Japanese gunfire and loosed a volley . The handle pounded against his fist , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metallic smell of the barrel eddied back to him , made what he was doing real again . He ducked in his hole waiting for the reply and winced involuntarily as the bullets whipped past . BEE-YOWWWW ! . . . BEE-YOOWWWW ! Some dirt snapped at his face from the ricochets . Croft was not conscious of feelingit . He had the surface numbness a man has in a fight . He flinched at sounds , his mouth tightened and loosened , his eyes stared , but he was oblivious to his body . Croft fired the gun again , held it for a long vicious burst , and then ducked in his hole . An awful scream singed the night , and for an instant Croft grinned weakly . Got him , he thought . He saw the metal burning through flesh , shattering the bones in its path . " AIIYOHHHH . " The scream froze him again , and for an odd disconnectedinstant he experienced again the whole complex of sounds and smells and sights when a calf was branded . " RECON , UP . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ten seconds to cover their advance . As he paused he could hear some men crawling behind him , and he whispered , " Recon ? " " Yeah . " Gallagher dropped into the hole with him . " Mother ofMary , " he muttered . Croft could feel him shaking beside him . " Stop it ! " he gripped his arm tensely . " The other men up ? " " Yeah . " Croft looked across the river again . Everything was silent , and the disconnected abrupt spurts of fire were forgotten like vanished sparks from a grindstone . Now that he was no longer alone , Croft was able to plan . The fact that men were up with him , were scattered in the brush along the bank between their two machine guns , recovered his sense of command . " They 're going to attack soon , " he whisperedhoarsely in Gallagher 's ear . Gallagher trembled again . " Ohh . No way to wake up , " he tried to say , but his voice kept lapsing . " Look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell them to hold fire until the Japs start to cross the river . " " I ca n't , I ca n't , " Gallagher whispered . Croft felt like striking him . " Go ! " he whispered . " I ca n't . " The Jap machine gun lashed at them from across the river . The bullets went singing into the jungle behind them , ripping at leaves . The tracers looked like red splints of lightning as they flattened into the jungle . A thousand rifles seemed to be firing at them from across the river , and the two men pressed themselves against the bottom of the hole . The sounds cracked against their eardrums . Croft 's head ached . Firing the machine gun had partially deafened him . BEEYOWWWW ! A ricochet slapped some more dirt on top of them . Croft felt it pattering on his back this time . He was trying to sense the moment when he would have to raise his head and fire the gun . The firing seemed to slacken , and he lifted his eyes cautiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . The Japanese machine gun raked through the brush at them . There was a shrill screaming sound , and the men covered their heads with their arms . BAA-ROWWMM , BAA-ROWWMM , 151ROWWMM , ROWWMM . The mortars exploded all about them , and something picked Gallagher up , shook him , and then released him . " 0 God , " he cried . A clod of dirt stung his neck . BAAROWWMM , BAA-ROWWMM . " Jesus , I 'm hit , " someone screamed , " I 'm hit . Something hitme . " BAA-ROWWMM . Gallagher rebelled against the force of the explosions . " Stop , Igive up , " he screamed . " STOP ! . . . I give up ! I give up ! " At that instant he no longer knew what made him cry out . BAA-ROWWMM , BAA-ROWWMM . " I 'm hit , I 'm hit , " someone was screaming . The Japanese rifleswere firing again . Croft lay on the floor of the hole with his hands against the ground and every muscle poised in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing as it scattered through the foliage . Croft picked up his flare gun . The firing had not abated , butthrough it he heard someone shouting in Japanese . He pointed the gun in the air . " Here they come , " Croft said . He fired the flare and shouted , " STOP ' EM ! " A shrill cry came out of the jungle across the river . It was thescream a man might utter if his foot was being crushed . " AAAIIIIII , AAAIIIIIIII . " The flare burst at the moment the Japanese started their charge . Croft had a split perception of the Japanese machine gun firing from a flank , and then he began to fire automatically , not looking where he fired , but holding his gun low , swinging it from side to side . He couldnot hear the other guns fire , but he saw their muzzle blasts like exhausts . He had a startling frozen picture of the Japanese running toward him across the narrow river . " AAAAIIIIIIIIIIH , " he heard again . In the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men revealed by a shaft of lightning . Croft no longer saw anything clearly ; he could not have said at that moment where his hands ended and the machine gun began ; he was lost in a vast moil of noise out of which15Zindividual screams and shouts etched in his mind for an instant . He could never have counted the Japanese who charged across the river ; he knew only that his finger was rigid on the trigger bar . He could not have loosened it . In those few moments he felt no sense of danger . He just kept firing . The line of men who charged across the river began to fall . In the water they were slowed considerably and the concentrated fire from recon 's side raged at them like a wind across an open field . They began to stumble over the bodies ahead of them . Croft saw one soldier reach into the air behind another 's body as though trying to clutch something in the sky and Croft fired at him for what seemed many seconds before the arm collapsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to cross the river where it turned and ran parallel to the bluff . He swung the gun about and lashed them with it . One man fell , and the other two paused uncertainlyand began to run back toward their own bank of the river . Croft had no time to follow them ; some soldiers had reached the beach on his side and were charging the gun . He fired point blank at them , and they collapsed about five yards from his hole . Croft fired and fired , switching targets with the quick reflexes of an athlete shifting for a ball . As soon as he saw men falling he would attack another group . The line of Japanese broke into little bunches of men who wavered , began to retreat . The light of the flare went out and Croft was blinded for a moment . There was no sound again in the darkness and he fumbled for another flare , feeling an almost desperate urgency . " Where is it ? " he whispered to Gallagher . " What ? " " Shit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he loaded the gun again . He was beginning to see in the darkness , and he hesitated . But something moved on the river and he fired the flare . As it burst , a few Japanese soldiers were caught motionless in the water . Croft pivoted his gun on them and fired . One of the soldiers remained standing for an incredible time . There was no expression on his face ; he looked vacant and surprised even as the bullets struck him in the chest . Nothing was moving now on the river . In the light of the flare , 153the bodies looked as limp and unhuman as bags of grain . One soldier began to float downstream , his face in the water . On the beach near the gun , another Japanese soldier was lying on his back . A wide stain of blood was spreading out from his body , and his stomach , ripped open , gaped like the swollen entrails of a fowl . On an impulse Croft fired a burst into him , and felt a twitch of pleasure as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Japanese . Every few seconds he would scream , the sound terrifying in the cruel blue light of the flare . Croft picked up a grenade . " That sonofabitch is makin ' too much noise , " he said . He pulled the pin and lobbed the grenade over to the opposite bank . It dropped like a beanbag on one of the bodies , and Croft pulled Gallagher down with him . The explosion was powerful and yet empty like a blast that collapses windowpanes . After a moment , the echoes ceased . Croft tensed himself and listened to the sounds from across the river . There was the quiet furtive noise of men retreating into the jungle . " GIVE ' EM A VOLLEY ! " he shouted . All the men in recon began to fire again , and Croft raked the jungle for a minute in short bursts . He could hear Wilson 's machine gun pounding steadily . " I guess we gave ' em something , " Croft told Gallagher . The flare was going out , and Croft stood up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toglio . " " Bad ? " Croft asked . " I 'm okay , " Toglio whispered . " I got a bullet in my elbow . " " Can you wait till morning ? " There was silence for a moment , then Toglio answered weakly , " Yeah , I 'll be okay . " Croft got out of his hole . " I 'm coming down , " he announced . " Hold your fire . " He walked along the path until he reached Toglio . Red and Goldstein were kneeling beside him , and Croft spoke to them in a low voice . " Pass this on , " he said . " We 're all gon na stay in our holes until mornin ' . I do n't think they 'll be back tonight , but you cai n't tell . And no one is gon na fall asleep . They 's only about an hour till dawn , so you ai n't got nothin ' to piss about . " 154 " I would n't go to sleep anyway , " Goldstein breathed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the same thing Gallagher had said . " Yeah , well , I just was n't ridin ' on my ass either , waitin ' for them to come , " Croft said . He shivered for a moment in the early morning air and realized with a pang of shame that for the first time in his life he had been really afraid . " The sonsofbitchin ' Japs , " he said . His legs were tired and he turned to go back to his gun . I hate the bastards , he said to himself , a terrible rage working through his weary body . " One of these days I 'm gon na really get me a Jap , " he whispered aloud . The river was slowly carrying the bodies downstream . " At least , " Gallagher said , " if we got to stay here a couple of days , the fuggers wo n't be stinkin ' up the joint . " 155The Time Machine : SAM CROFT THE HUNTERA lean man of medium height but he held himself so erectly he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression . There seemed nothing wasted in his hard small jaw , gaunt firm cheeks and straight short nose . His gelid eyes were very blue . . . he was efficient and strong and usually empty and his main cast of mind was a superior contempt toward nearly all other men . He hated weaknessand he loved practically nothing . There was a crude unformed vision in his soul but he was rarely conscious of it . No , but why is Croft that way ? Oh , there are answers . He is that way because of the corruptionof-the-society . He is that way because the devil has claimed him for one of his own . It is because he is a Texan ; it is because he has renouncedGod . He is that kind of man because the only woman he ever loved cheated on him , or he was born that way , or he was having problems of adjustment . Croft 's father , Jesse Croft , liked to say , " Well , now , my Sam is a mean boy . I reckon he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking of his wife who was ailing , a weak woman sweet and mild , might add , " ' Course Sam got mother 's milk if ever a one did , but Ah figger it turned sour for him ' cause that was the only way his stomach would take it . " Then he would cackle and blow his nose into his hand and wipe it on the back of his pale-blue dungarees . ( Standing before his dirty wood barn , the red dry soil of western Texas under his feet . ) " Why , Ah ' member once Ah took Sam huntin ' , he was only an ittybittyrunt , not big enough to hold up the gun hardly . . . but he was a mean shot from the beginning . And Ah 'll tell ya , he just did n't like tohave a man interfere with him . That was one thing could always rile im , even when he was an itty-bitty bastard . " Could n't stand to have anyone beat him in anythin ' . " Never could lick him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he 'd never make a sound . Jus ' stand there lookin ' at me as if he was fixir , to wallop me back , or maybe put a bullet in mah head . " Croft hunted early . In the winter , in the chill Texas desert , it used to be a cold numbing ride across twenty miles of rutted hardbakedroad with the dust blowing like emery into the open battered Ford . The two big men in the front would say little , and the one who was not driving would blow on his fingers . When they reached the forest , the sun would still be straining to rise above the brown-red line of ridge . Now , look , boy , see that trail , that 's a deer run . They ai n't hardly a man is smart enough to track down a deer . You set an ' wait for ' em , and you set where the wind is blowin ' down from the deer to you . You got to wait a long time . The boy sits shivering in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for any ole deer . Ah 'm gon na track ' em . He stalks through the forest with the wind on his face . It 's dark , and the trees are silver-brown , and the ground is a deep-olive velvet . Where is that ole deer ? He kicks a twig out of his way , and stiffens as a buck goes clattering through the brush . Goddam ! Ole deer is fast . Next time he is more cautious . He finds a deer track , kneels down and traces the hoofprint tenderly , feeling a thrill . Ah 'm gon na track this old deer . For two hours he creeps through the forest , watching where he places his feet , putting his heel down first , then his toes before he shifts his weight . When the dried thorny branches catch in his clothing , he pulls them free quietly , one by one . In a little clearing he sees a deer and freezes . The wind is blowinggently against his face , and he thinks he can smell the animal . Goddam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The stag turns slowly , looks past him from a hundred yards . Sonofabitch cain'tsee me . The boy raises his gun , and trembles so badly the sights waver . He lowers it , and curses himself . Jus ' a little ole woman . He brings it up again , holding it steadily , moving the front sight over until it points a few inches below the muscle of the foreleg . Ah 'm goin ' to git him through the heart . BAA-WOWWW ! It is someone else 's gun , and the deer drops . The boy runs forwardalmost weeping . Who shot him ? That was mah deer . I 'll kill the sonofabitch who shot him . Jesse Croft is laughing at him . Ah tole you , boy , to set where Ah put you . Ah tracked that deer . You scared that deer into me . Ah heard ya footing it from a mile away . You 're a liar . You 're a goddam liar . The boy throws himself at his father , and tries to strike him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he sits down . You ole sonofabitch , he screams , and flings himself at his father again . Jesse holds him off , laughing . Little ole wildcat , ai n't ya ? Well , you got to wait ten years ' fore you can whop your pa . That deer were mine . One that wins is the one that gits it . The tears freeze in the boy 's eyes and wither . He is thinking that if he had n't trembled he would have shot the deer first . " Yes , sir , " Jesse Croft said , " they wa'n ' a thing my Sam could stand to have ya beat him in . When he was ' bout twelve , they was a fool kid down at Harper who used to give Sam a lickin ' . " ( Scratching the back of his gray scraggly hair , his hat in his hand . ) " That kid would lick Sam every day , and Sam would go back and pick a fight the next day . Ah 'll tell ya , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid . " And then when he was older , about seventeen maybe , he used to be bustin ' horses down to the fair in August , and he was known to be ' bout the best rider in the county . Then one time a fella all the way from Denison came down and beat him in a reg'lar competition with158judges and all . I ' member Sam was so mad he would n't talk to no one for two days . " He got good stock in him , " Jesse Croft declared to his neighbors . " We was one of the first folks to push in here , must be sixty years ago , and they was Crofts in Texas over a hunnerd years ago . Ah 'd guess some of them had that same meanness that Sam 's got . Maybe it was what made ' em push down here . " Deer hunting and fighting and busting horses at the fair make up in hours a total of perhaps ten days a year . There are the other things , the long flat sweeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the endless meals in the big kitchen with his parents and brothers and the ranch foremen . There are the conversations in the bunkhouse . The soft reflective voices . Ah tell ya that little gal is gon na remember me unless she was too goddam drunk . Ah jus ' looked at that nigger after that , an ' Ah said , Boy , you no-good black bastard , an ' Ah jus ' picked up that hatchet an ' let him have it right across the head . But the sonofabitch did n't even bleed much . You can kill an elephant about as fast as you can kill a nigger in the head . A whoor is no damn good for a man , Ah got ta have it at least five six times ' fore Ah 'm satisfied , and that ole business of stickin ' it in once an ' then reachin ' for your hat jus ' leaves me more fussed than it 's worth . Ah been keepin ' an eye on that south herd leader , the red one with the spot ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be gittin ' mean when the hot weather comes . The Education of Samuel Croft . And always , day after day , the dust of cattle through the long shimmering afternoons in the sun . A man gets bored and it 's uncomfortablefalling asleep in a saddle . Thinking of town maybe . ( B and a whorehouse , dry goods . ) Sam , you gittin ' itchy ? 159A lazy somnolent pulsing in his loins . The sun refracts from thehide of his horse , bathes his thighs in a lazy heat . Yeah , some . They 're fixin ' to start a National Guard outfit in Harper . Yeah ? Ah finger they 'll be some women hangin ' round the uniforms , an ' ya git to do a lot of shootin ' . Maybe I 'll go down with ya . He wheels his horse to the left and rides out to turn back a straggler . The first time Croft ever killed a man he was in a National Guard uniform . There was a strike on at Lilliput in the oil fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Guard . ( The sonsofbitches started this strike come from up north , New York . They 's some good boys in the oil fields but they got they heads turned by Reds , an ' next thing they 'll have ya kissin ' niggers ' asses . ) The guardsmen made a line against the gate to the plant and stood sweating in a muggy summer sun . The pickets yelled and jeered at them . Hey , drillers , they called out the Boy Scouts . Let 's rush ' em . They 're jus ' company scabs too . Croft stands in line with his mouth tightening . They 're gon na rush us , the soldier next to him says . The Guard lieutenant is a haberdashery salesman . If there 're rocks being thrown you better lie down , men . If it should git real bad , fire a couple of rounds over their heads . A stone lofts through the air . The crowd is sullen outside the gate , and every now and then one of them shouts some curses at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Croft says . A rock strikes one of the soldiers , and they lie down on the ground and point their rifles above the heads of the advancing crowd . Let 's rip the place apart . About ten men start to walk toward the gate . Some stones fly over their heads and scatter among the soldiers . All right , men , the lieutenant pipes , fire over them. 160Croft sights down his barrel . He has pointed his gun at the chest of the nearest man , and he feels a curious temptation . I 'll just squeeze the trigger a little bit . BAA-WOWWW ! The shot is lost in the volley , but the striker drops . Croft feels a hollow excitement . The lieutenant is cursing . Goddam , who shot him , men ? Guess they 's no way to find out , Lieutenant , Croft says . He watches the mob retreating in a panic . Bunch o ' dogs , he tells himself . His heart is beating , and his hands feel very dry . " ' Member that gal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing for her , she was a reg'lar ole tomcat , " Jesse Croft said . ( He spewed an oyster of phlegm , and ground it reflectively with his boot . ) " Jus ' the meanest little ole girl , Ah 'll tell ya she was a mate for him till they busted up . They ai n't one of the gals my boys 've married that I woulda taken up against her . Ah 'm an old man , but Ah 'll tell ya , mah balls would git to itchin ' when Ah 'd look at her and jus ' think of lovin ' up to her . " ( Scratching his pants vigorously . ) " Trouble with Sam he shouldn'ta married her . When a man can knock off a piece with a woman without slippin ' her a weddin ' ring , it don ' pay to git any ideas about settlin ' down with her . A woman that likes her nookie ai n't gon na be satisfied with one man after she gits used to him . " ( Pointing his finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reckon that 's a law of life . " Oh , give it to me , you sonofabitch , give it to me , I 'LL KILL YOU IF YOU STOP . Who 's your man ? You 're my man , you give it to me , give it to me , give it to me . They ai n't nobody can make love to you like me . They ai n't anybody , anybody , oh , you 're just a goddam fuggin machine . The long sliding of a belly against a belly . I love ya better than any man ever could. 161You do , baby , you do . Ah 'm jus ' an old fuggin machine . ( Crack . . . that ... whip ! Crack ... that . . . WHIP ! ) After they married , Croft rented a little house on the ranch from his father . He and Janey petered out for each other through a slow taciturn year , through a thousand incidents which they forgot while the effects still remained . At night they would sit by themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk . In a dumb instinctive way , Croft would search for an approach . Want to go to bed ? It 's early , Sam . Yeah . And an anger would work in him . They had torn at each other once , had felt sick when they were close together and other people were with them . Now , in sleep their bodies intruded ; there was always a heavy limb in the way . And the nights together working on them , this new change , this living together between them like a heavy dull weight , washing dishes and mouthing familiar kisses . The buddy system . But he wanted no buddy . In the quiet nights in the cheap parlor of this house set on the Texas plains , an undefined rage increased and increased . There were the things he did not know how to utter ( the great space of the night ) , the fury between them balked almost completelynow . There were the trips to town , the drinking bouts between them , the occasional kindling of their bodies in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the irreversible reaction . It ended with him going to town alone , and taking a whore when he was drunk , beating her sometimes with a wordless choler . And for Janey it resulted in other men , ranch hands , once one of his brothers . " It jus ' don ' pay to marry a woman with hot pants , " Jesse Croft said later . Croft found out in a quarrel . And another thing , you go tomcattin ' to town , and jus ' hellin ' around , well , don ' be thinkin ' Ah 'm jus ' sittin ' around . They 's things Ah can tell you too. 162What things ? You want to know , do n't ya ? You got yore water hot . Jus ' don ' push me around . What things ? She laughs . Jus ' a way of talkin ' . Croft slaps her across the face , catches her wrists and shakes her . WHAT THINGS ? You sonofabitch . ( Her eyes glaring . ) You know what kind of things . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing you ai n't best in , she screams . Croft stands there trembling and then wrenches out of the room . ( Goddam whore . ) He feels nothing and then anger and shame and then nothing again . At this moment his initial love , his initial need of her is full-throated again . ( Jus ' an ole fuggin machine . ) " If Sam coulda found any of the boys who was scooting up her pants , he'da killed ' em , " Jesse Croft said . " He tore around like he was gon na choke us all with his hands and then he took off for town and threw himself about as good a drunk as Ah 've seen him indulge . And when he got back he 'd enlisted himself in the Army . " After that there were always other men 's wives . You must think I 'm a pretty cheap woman going out with you like this . Would n't say that . Everybody likes to have a good time . That 's it . ( Drinking her beer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . You do n't think a bit cheap of me , do you , soldier ? Hell , you 're too good-lookin ' a woman for me to think cheap . ( Have another beer . ) And later . Jack do n't treat me right . You understand me . That 's right , honey , I understand you . They roll together in bed . Ai n't nothing wrong with that philosophy , she says . Not a damn thing wrong . ( And . . . crack . . . that . WHIP ! ) You 're all fuggin whores , he thinks. 163His ancestors pushed and labored and strained , drove their oxen , sweated their women , and moved a thousand miles . He pushed and labored inside himself and smoldered with an endless hatred . ( You 're all a bunch of fuggin whores ) ( You 're all a bunch of dogs ) ( You 're all deer to track ) I HATE EVERYTHING WHICH IS NOT IN MYSELF6THE BATTLE that began on the night of the storm carried over well into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of many similar assaults that sputtered up and down the river for hours , and ended at last in a breathless and dreary stalemate . Almost every one of the line companies was involved at one time or another , and each time the pattern was repeated . A group of thirty or fifty or a hundred Japanese would try to cross the river against a squad or platoonof American soldiers , entrenched in foxholes with automatic weapons . That night the Japanese had struck first at Cummings 's left flank near the water , and then at dawn had engaged the two companies near the mountain bluffs where recon held the extreme right flank . After both had failed , Toyaku attacked in early daylight the center of the line , and succeeded in giving one company a bad mauling , and forced another to retreat almost back to 2nd Battalion headquarters . The General , still at headquarters battery of the 151st , made a quick decision , confirmed the tactics he had decided upon the preceding night , and sent out orders that the center of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to send four hundred men across the river and four or five tanks , before the General 's artillery and counterattacks by companies on the edge of the gap made it too expensive to continue . At the most dangerous moment for Cummings , it was still no worse than the problem of ejecting the rump of a fat man who had broken a164hole through the stuffing of a couch , and was now spluttering and wriggling his backside in an effort to escape . The General attacked with his reserves , concentrated all the division 's artillery on a natural Tearing into which the Japanese behind his lines had been forced , and with the aid of his tanks , which had been held in readiness at a point only a quarter mile from the Japs ' deepest penetration , succeeded in puncturing the rump . It was the biggest battle of the campaign to date , and the most successful . By late afternoon of that day the Japanese striking force was shattered , and the survivors disappeared into the jungle again , and were either pinched off one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making their way back across the river to their own lines . This was the second time the General had routed a force which had penetrated his lines , and he gave Hearn a little lectureabout it . " This kind of thing is what I call my dinner-table tactics . I 'm the little lady who allows the lecher beside me to get his hand way up under my dress before I cut off his wrist . " Tag ends of the battle spouted for a few days , and there were many local fire fights and patrol clashes , but the General , with what Hearn had to admit was unerring instinct , had cut through the subsidiaryclashes , the confusing and contradictory patrol reports , to understand that the battle as far as Toyaku was concerned was over after his smash at the middle of the line had been absorbed . The General spent the next day in re-establishing the hole in his lines , and divertingagain his reserve to its work on the road . Two or three days later , after a lot of patrol activity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which brought his front elements within a few thousand yards of the Toyaku Line . He estimated it would take him another two weeks to bring the road up to his front , and in another week the Toyaku Line should be breached . He was exceptionally easy to get along with the week after the battle , and as a symptom of that , he was continually feeding Hearn his private military maxims . " Toyaku 's through in an offensive sense , " he told Hearn . " When the over-all strategy of your campaign is defensive you can figure on losing about a fifth of your force in counteroffensives , and then you 've just got to dig in . Toyaku frittered it away . The Japanese brood their way through campaigns ; they sit around restless until the tension gets too165great and then they erupt . It 's a fascinating paradox . They have that game of theirs , go , which is all feverish activity , all turning of flanks , and encirclements , and then when they fight they act like wounded animals who roar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not the way to work it . In an army whenever you have unnecessary precautions , men guarding sectors which do n't demand it , or being idle for some other reason than that they need the rest , then you 've acted immorally as a commander . The less duplication , the less wasted effort , the greater it follows will be the pressure you exert on your opponent . And the greater will be the opportunities that arise for you . ' As a corollary of this , he had set his headquarters troops to rebuildingtheir bivouac two days after the battle . The tents went up again , the gravel walks in the officers ' portion of the bivouac were filled in again , and the General 's own tent had a floor of duckboards . Officers ' mess in this bivouac had a better location , but after the storm it was improved even more with secondary bamboo ridgepoles which held the sides straight . A consignment of fresh meat came in , and headquarters company 's ration of it was divided equally . One half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bivouac at the time , and the other half went to the thirty-eight officers in officers ' mess . The General 's electric refrigerator was uncrated , and was fed from the gasoline generator that created all the electric power for the bivouac . Hearn was disgusted . And once again he was bothered by one of the minor enigmas about the General . The meat business had been a flagrant injustice , one which Hobart as the G-4 in command of assigningsupplies would be quite capable of committing , but Hobar had not been responsible . Hearn had been in the General 's tent whet Hobart had come up with a grin and told Cummings that some fresh meat had come . The General had shrugged and then given some unmistakablesuggestions on how it should be divided . It was incredible . The General with his undeniable perception must have known what the effect would be on the enlisted men , and yet he had disregarded the resentments it would cause . It could not have been to satisfy his belly , for Hearn watched him pick tastelessly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost always left his plate half filled . Nor could it have been from habit ; the General was quite aware of what he was doing . He considered it effective . After Hobart had left , the General had looked at Hearn blankly , his great pale eyes quite expressionless , and then unaccountably he had winked . " Have to keep you happy , Robert . Perhaps if the meals are better you wo n't be in-'ulging your temper so much . " " Very thoughtful of you , sir . " And the General had roared suddenly with an odd choked mirth that began with a cascade of chuckles , progressed through a choking fit , and ended with him sitting upright in his chair and hawking his sputum into his silk monogrammed handkerchief . " I think it 's about time a recreation tent was set up for the officers ' use at night , " he said at last . " You 're not too busy right now , Robert . I 'll put you in charge of it . " An odd commission . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headquarters company to give him a detail of men , had them clear the roots and grass from a plot of ground , cover it with gravel , and erect a squad tent . When it was up , a deep rain trench was dug all around it . A double entrance was contrived at the front to make it a blackout tent , and some strips of canvas from a discarded tent were used to drape over the lashed corners so that no light could leak out at night . When they had finished with that , Hearn spent an afternoon having them cut bamboo and erect a few writing tables , and two game tables . He had commanded them sullenly through the entire project , quite aware of their resentment toward him , always able to overhear the bitter muttered remarks that were meant for him . The General had given him this assignment because he knew he would hate it , and for that reason Hearn was determined to do a perfect job . He became very finicky about sloppy items in the tent 's construction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in command of the detail . All very fine , but that seemed a little too shallow a satisfactionfor the General . The lesson beneath the lesson appeared a little later . The soldier.vho had been assigned to the operation of the generator in the daytimehad been given the officers ' recreation tent as an additional chore. 167He was supposed to furl the side flaps in the morning and let them down at night and fasten the sides . He was also , since the noise of the generator was considered too loud to be used at night , supposed to fill all the Coleman lanterns with kerosene , and light them . Hearn went into the recreation tent one evening several days after it had been completed , and found it still dark . A few officers were groping around and swearing to each other . " Hey , Hearn , " one of them called to him , " how about getting on the ball and giving us some light ? " He stalked over to the pup tent of the recreation tent orderly , and bawled him out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have too many jobs to handle ? " " Jesus , Lieutenant , I 'm sorry . I just forgot about it . " " Well , all right , hop to it , do n't stand there looking at me . " Hearn had found himself about to yell , " Get on the ball , man , will you , " and after Rafferty got out of his tent and went jogging over to the motor pool to get some kerosene , Hearn had looked at him with disgust . Stupid ass , he thought , and immediately afterward , with a shock , he realized the trace of contempt he was beginning to feel for an enlisted man . It was slight , barely apparent , and yet it was there . They had tried to balk him when they were building the tent , they had indulged every tiny advantage they could . They had done it beforethey even worked with him , before they knew him ; they had accepted him with an instinctive and immediate distrust , and he resentedit . Suddenly he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added . In the past when he worked with enlisted men he had been tough because he considered his sympathies had no place in a particularjob . When men worked they generally resented their leader . That was unimportant . He had not resented them . And now there were the beginnings of resentment . The Gen eral 's point was clear enough . He was an officer , and in functioning as an officer for a long enough time he would assume , whether he wanted to or not , the emotional prejudices of his class . The General was reminding him that he belonged to that class . He remembered Cummings 's pale baleful eyes staring at him blankly , and then the168inexplicable wink . " Have to keep you happy , Robert . " It was a little clearer now . Hearn had known ever since he had been with the General that if he wanted to he could easily rise to a field officer 's rank by the end of the war . And there was an ambition in him which responded to that , an ambition he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him then that if he wanted to , if he was strong enough to overcome the distastes and prejudices he felt toward officers , he could satisfy that ambition . Understand your class and work within its limits . Marxist lesson with a reverse twistIt disturbed Hearn deeply . He had been born in the aristocracy of the wealthy midwestern family , and although he had broken with them , had assumed ideas and concepts repugnant to them , he had never really discarded the emotional luggage of his first eighteen years . The guilts he made himself feel , the injustices that angered him were never genuine . He kept the sore alive by continually rubbing it , and he knew it . He knew also at this moment that out of all the reasons why he had begun to quarrel with Conn in officers ' mess , one of the vital ones had been that he was afraid of not really caring enough about what Conn was saying . It was true of too many of his reactions . And since his direct self-interest could only move him back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other direction for him to turn , unless there was some other emotional basis for continuing in his particular isolated position on the Left . For a long time he had thought there was one , for even a longer period he had sustained his politics because his friends and acquaintances in New York assumed them as a matter of course , but now in the isolation of the Army , under the searching critique of the General 's mind , his fingers were being pulled from the chinning bar . He walked back to the recreation tent and went inside . Rafferty had filled the lamps and lit them , and already the evening influx of officers had begun . Two card games had been started , and several of the officers were beginning to use the writing tables . " Hey , Hearn , you want to come in on some poker ? " It was Mantelli , one of Hearn 's few friends in the ' headquarters . " All right . " Hearn pulled up a chair . Since the tent had been set169up , Hearn had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Actually he found it dull and uncomfortable , for it became tremendously hot inside and the air filled quickly with cigarette and cigar smoke , but this was a part of the continual sparring that went on between the General and himself . The General had wanted him to build the tent ? all right , he would use it . But , tonight , after his realization about Rafferty , the idea of seeing the General gave Hearn an intimation of dread . There had been very few people he ever feared , but he was beginning to think he was afraid of the General . The cards came around to him , and he shuffled them and dealt , playingmechanically without much interest . He could feel himself per .. spiring already , and he stripped his shirt and hung it on the back of his chair . It went this way every evening . By eleven o'clock virtually all the officers were in their undershirts , and the tent stank of sweat and smoke . " Those cards are gon na be hot for me tonight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigar . The babel of chatter was dense already , saturated in the smoke . Somewhere , far off in the jungle , some artillery fired once , the sound thudding in Hearn 's head like a jaded angry nerve . Division 's nightly smoker , he muttered to himself . He had played only a few hands with moderate luck when there was an interruption . The General for the first time had come into the tent . - Attention ! " somebody bawled . " At ease , gentlemen , " the General murmured . He stared about the tent , his nostrils wrinkling faintly at the odor . " Hearn , " the Generalcalled . Sir ? ' " I need you . " He waved his hand slightly , his voice brisk and impersonal . While Hearn was still buttoning on his shirt , he left the tent . " Go ahead , run to poppa , " Mantelli grinned . Hearn was angry . Normally , the fact that the General had come to him would have been pleasing , but the General 's voice had humiliatedhim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tent . " I 'll get back that money later , " he said to Mantelli . " Not tonight , huh ? " one of the other officers at the table gibed . " My master 's voice , " Hearn said . He finished buttoning his shirt , kicked his chair back into place , and walked through the tent . In one corner a few officers were drinkingup one of their ration bottles of whisky . He heard them singing and then he was fumbling with the folds of the double curtain at the blackout exit . After the lights inside , he was blinded as he emerged into the dark cool air , so blinded that he almost collided with the General , who had been waiting for him . " Sorry , I thought you 'd gone on ahead , " Hearn muttered . " It 's all right . " The General strolled slowly toward his own tent , and Hearn constrained his pace to keep from walking too fast . Had the General heard him say " My master 's voice " ? Aaah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need me for , General ? " " We 'll discuss that when we get to the tent . " " Yes , sir . " Between them for the moment there was some antagonism . They walked on in silence , their feet crunching into the gravel walk . Only one or two men passed by them in the darkness ; with the night , almost all activity halted in the bivouac . About them in the rough ellipse of their area Hearn could feel almost tangibly the ring of enlisted men sitting in their foxholes on guard . " Quiet tonight , " he muttered . " Yes . " At the entrance to the General 's tent , another collision occurred . Hearn halted at the tent flaps to allow the General to precede him , and Cummings in turn put his hand on Hearn 's back to indicate that he was to go first . They both started at once , and Hearn sideswiped the General , felt him recoil a foot or two from the weight of Hearn 's big body . " Sorry . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little spasm of anger Hearn separated the flaps and walked in ahead . When Cummings followed , his face was extremely pale and his lower lip showed the indentation of two teeth . Either the collision had hurt him more than Hearn had thought or he was disturbed enough to pinch his lip . But why ? It would be more characteristic for Cummings to find amusement in the situation. 170 1711,111Still defiant , Hearn sat down without pernnssion . The General seemed about to say something and then was silent . He took the other chair , which faced his desk , shifted it slightly to face Hearn , and stared at him impassively for almost a minute . He had an entirely new expression on his face , one Hearn had never seen before . The bald gray eyes with their immense and startling white pupils seemed dulled . Hearn had the impression that he could touch the surface of Cummings'seyeballs , and the eyes would not blink . In the slight pinch of his mouth , the constriction of the muscles at all the vertices of his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock , Hearn wondered at the tensions that had made the General seek him out . It must have been humiliating . Even more , there was no artifice about it now , no suggestion of work for him on the General 's clean furled desk . Hearn stared at the map of Anopopei that lay tacked to a large drawing board . The ocarina on which the General played his little tune . Once again Hearn realized how barren was the General 's tent . Wherever he was , on Motome , in his ship 's cabin , or here , he never seemed to live in a place . The tent was so austere . The cot looked unsleptin , the desk was bare again , and the third and unoccupied chair rested at perfect right angles to the larger of the two foot lockers . The tent floor was bare and clean , unmarred by mud . The light of the Colemanlantern threw long diagonals of light and shadow across all the rectangular objects of the tent , so that it looked like an abstract painting . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he did not know him at all . Like the pulse of their blood , some artillerysounded again in the distance . " I was wondering , Robert , " the General said at last . " Yes , sir ? " " You know , I do n't know a damn thing about you really . " The voice was flat and colorless . " What 's the matter , have I been stealing your whisky ? " " Perhaps you have . . . figuratively . " What the hell did that mean ? The General leaned back in his chair , the next question a little too casual . " How 's the recreation tent going ? " 172 " Fine . " " The Army still has n't figured out a way to change the air in a blackout tent . " " Oh , it stinks over there all right . " So the General had been lonesome for him . Poor little rich boy . " I ca n't complain , though , I 've cleared a hundred bucks out of the poker games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , three . " The General smiled thinly . " That 's right , it was three nights . " " As if you did n't know . " The General lit a cigarette and extinguished the match with a slow wave of his hand . " I assure you , Robert , there are a few other concerns in my mind . " " I did n't say there were n't . " The General glared at him with a deliberate , self-conscious unveilingof his eyes . " You 've got so damn much cheek you 're going to die before a firing squad someday . " The voice had been a suppressed bellow , and with acute surprise Hearn saw that the General 's fingers were trembling . The suspicion of an idea almost defined itself in his head and then was lost like a piece of thread that misses the eye of a needle and wavers fragilely before collapsing . " Sorry . " And this too seemed the wrong thing to say . The General 's mouth was white again . Cummings leaned back in his folding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then abruptly beamed at Hearn with a fatherlygenial air , incredibly counterfeit . " You 're still a little annoyed at me about the meat , are n't you ? " he asked . Annoyed . The General had used that word once before . An odd word at this time . Was he in the driver 's seat now ? It was a little eerie to feel that the General was coming to him , a little uncomfortable . And instinctively his mind clamped down , became grudging and aware as if soon he would be asked for something he did not want to grant . The General would never put a handle to their relationship . At times they had the easy tacit friendship that many generals had with their aides , field officers with their orderlies . And there were all the other moments when they were much closer ? the discussions , the173occasional bits of gossip . There was also the antagonism between them . And he could n't find the bone on which all this was grafted . " I suppose I am annoyed , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men got on their meat is n't going to make them love you any . " " They 'll blame Hobart or Mantelli or the mess sergeant . That 's hardly to the point anyway . You do n't really care , you know that . " Damn if he 'd give anything away free . " If I did , you certainly could n't understand it . " " I imagine I could . I probably have a normal allotment of decent impulses . " " Hah . " " You do n't think , Robert . The root of all the liberals ' ineffectivenesscomes right spang out of the desperate suspension in which they have to hold their minds . " Right spang out of it ! It was almost pleasant to find a bit of midwesternearth in all the polished and refracted facets of the General 's speech . " Name calling is always easy , " Hearn muttered . " Oh , think , man , will you ? If you ever followed anything through to the end , not one of your ideas would last for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this war , do n't you ? " " Yes , but I still do n't get the tie-up with the meat . " " Well , then , follow me out in this . And you 're going to have to take my word , for I 've made a study . When I was your age , a little older , the type of thing that preoccupied me was what makes a nation fight well . " " I imagine it would be a kind of identity between the people and the country whether it 's for good reasons or bad . " The General shook his head . " That 's a liberal historian 's attitude . You 'd be surprised what a tiny factor that is . " The lamp was beginning to sputter and he reached over to adjust the valve , his face lit rather dramatically for a moment by the light source beneath his chin . " There are just two main elements . A nation fights well in proportion to the amount of men and materials it has . And the other equation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective soldier the poorer his standard of living has been in the past . " " That 's the whole works , huh ? " 174 " There 's one other big factor I 've played with for a time . If you 're fighting in defense of your own soil , then perhaps you 're a little more effective . " " Then you come back to my point . " " I wonder if you know how complicated that is . If a man fights on his own soil , it 's also a great deal easier for him to desert . That 's one problem I never have to consider on Anopopei . It 's true the other thing overweighs it , but stop and think about it . Fondness for a countryis all very lovely , it even is a morale factor at the beginning of a war . But fighting emotions are very undependable , and the longer a war lasts the less value they have . After a couple of years of war , there are only two considerations that make a good army : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why do you think a regiment of Southerners is worth two regiments of Easterners ? " " I do n't think they are . " " Well , it happens to be true . " The General placed his fingertips together judiciously and looked at Hearn . " I 'm not peddling theories . This is observation . And the conclusions leave me , as a general officer , in a poor position . We have the highest standard of living in the world and , as one would expect , the worst individual fighting soldiers of any big power . Or at least in their natural state they are . They 're comparatively wealthy , they 're spoiled , and as Americans they share most of them the peculiar manifestation of our democracy . They have an exaggerated idea of the rights due themselves as individuals and no idea at all of the rights due others . It 's the reverse of the peasant , and I 'll tell you right now it 's the peasant who makes the soldier . " " So what you 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Exactly . Break them down . Every time an enlisted man sees an officer get an extra privilege , it breaks him down a little more . " " I do n't see that . It seems to me they 'd hate you more . " " They do . But they also fear us more . I do n't care what kind of man you give me , if I have him long enough I 'll make him afraid . Every time there 's what you call an Army injustice , the enlisted man involved is confirmed a little more in the idea of his own inferiority . " He smoothed the hair over his temple . " I happen to know of an American prison camp in England which 'll be a terror once we invade175Europe . The methods used will be brutal , and it 's going to cause a stink eventually , but it happens to be necessary . In our own back yard we have a particular replacement depot where an attempt was actuallymade to kill the Colonel in command . You are n't capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert , that to make an Army work you have to have every man in it fitted into a fear ladder . Men in prison camps , deserters , or men in replacement camps are in the backwatersof the Army and the discipline has to be proportionately more powerful . The Army functions best when you 're frightened of the man above you , and contemptuous of your subordinates . " " Where do I fit into this ? " Hearn asked . " You do n't yet . There are such things as papal dispensations . " The General grinned at him , lit another cigarette . Almost entirely muted , a burst of laughter from the recreation tent filtered through the bivouac to them . Hearn sat forward . " You take the man who 's out on guard right now , and listens to that laughter . It seems to me there 'd come a time when he 'd want to turn his machine gun around . " " Oh , eventually . The time soldiers start doing that is when an army is about defeated . Until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them fight a little better . They ca n't turn it on us , so they turn it out-ward . " " But you 've a big gamble there , " Hearn said . " If we lose the war , you 've produced a revolution . It seems to me in terms of your interest it would be better to lose the war by being overgood to the men , and avoid the revolution afterward . " Cummings laughed . " That would be one of your liberal week lies , would n't it ? You 're an ass , Robert . We 're not going to lose the war , and if we did , you do n't think Hitler would grant a revolution , do you ? " " Then what you 're saying is that you people ca n't lose the war either way . " " You people , you people , " the General parroted . " That 's a bit of Marxism , is n't it , the great big capitalist conspiracy . Just how do you know so much about Marxism ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I doubt it . I doubt if you really have . " The General pinched the butt of his cigarette reflectively . " You 're misreading history if you see this war as a grand revolution . It 's power concentration . " Hearn shrugged . " I 'm a poor history student , I 'm no thinker . I just think it 's bad sense to have men hating you . " " Again I say it 's not important if they 're afraid of you . Robert , stop and think , with all the hate there 's been in the world , there have been surprisingly few revolutions . " He ticked his chin softly with his fingernail , a little sensuously , as if he were absorbed in the scraping sound of his beard . " You can even see the Russian revolution as a space-organization progress . The machine techniques of this century demand consolidation , and with that you 've got to have fear , because the majority of men must be subservient to the machine , and it 's not a business they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taken the form it invariably assumed . The more intangible and inchoate criteria he tried to use still had value , but to someone who thought like the General , his ideas would appear no more than sentiment , false sentiment , as Cummings had told him so many times . Still he made an effort . " There are other things , " he said quietly . " I do n't see where you can dismiss the continual occurrence and re-forming of certain great ethical ideas . " The General smiled slightly . " Robert , politics have no more relation to history than moral codes have to the needs of any particular man . " Epigrams and more epigrams . He felt a certain revulsion . " General , by the time you get done after this war , working out the next biggerconsolidation , the American in the ' forties is going to have the same kind of anxiety that the Europeans had in the ' thirties when they knew the next war would finish them . " " Probably . The natural role of twentieth-century man is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarette , and found with surprise that his hands were shaking . The General was transparent for this single moment . Cummings had begun this argument purposely , had re-establishedthe poise , the unique superior adaptation he had been lacking , for whatever reason , when they had entered the tent . " You 're too stubborn ever to give in , Robert . " The General stood177IHearn woke up to realize he was in trouble after only six moves . Sloppily , without any real consideration , he had violated a principle by moving his knight twice before his development was completed . His position was not yet dangerous , the knight was only in the fourth rank , and its squares of retreat could be opened easily enough , but the General was opening with an odd attack . Hearn began really to study the game . By now the General could win by completing his developmentand extracting all the juice out of the slight positional advantage he would have on completion . But it would be a long contest , and the end game would undoubtedly be difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be very embarrassing if it failed , for Cummings 's development would be backward , and his king 's pawns would have to be opened . Hearn pondered his responses , and lost himself quickly in the dizzying heights of chess , where he held the entire position in one portion of his mind while investigating the numerous answers the General might make to each move , and the correspondingly more complex replies he himself could manage . Then he would relinquish that approach and try to discern the variations that might arise from moving another piece . Yet it was hopeless . With almost frightening skill , Hearn felt himself being harassed , then threatened , then strangled by the advanceof the General 's pawns . Hearn had been on his college chess team , and at different periods in his life he had been tremendously interested in the game . He was a good enough player to realize how very good the General was , good enough to understand something of a man 's nature by the style in which he played , and the General had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everypossible advantage from the slight superiority he had had at the be-1111inning . Hearn conceded on the twenty-fifth move after losing a gknight and a pawn in exchange for two pawns , and sat back in his chair fatigued . The game had caught him , piqued his interest , and he felt a sullen desire to play again . " You 're not bad , " the General said . " I 'm fair , " Hearn muttered . Now that the game was over , he was aware once more of the jungle sounds outside the tent. up and walked over to his foot locker . " To tell you the truth . I did n't ask you over here for a discussion . I thought perhaps we might have a game of chess together . " " All right . " Hearn was surprised , a little uneasy . " I do n't think I 'll give you much of a battle . " " We 'll see . " The General set up a small folding table between them , and began placing the pieces on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or twice , and the General had spoken vaguely of playing , but Hearn had discounted it . " You really want to play ? " he asked . " Certainly . " " If someone walks in , it 'll be a pretty sight . " The General grinned . " Clandestine , eh ? " He had finished arrangingthe pieces , and he picked up a red and a white pawn , hid one in each of his fists and then extended them for Hearn to choose . " I 'm rather fond of this set , " the General said genially . " It 's hand-carved ivory , not really so dear as you 'd think , but the man who made it is a pretty indisputably a craftsman . " Hearn , without comment , picked the red pawn , and after replacingthem the General made the opening move . Hearn gave a conventionalresponse , settled his head comfortably in his large hands , and tried to study the board . But he found himself nervous . He was feelingboth excited and depressed ; the conversation had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was playing chess with the General . It made everything between them more overt . There seemed something vaguely indecent about it , and he entered the game with a feeling that it would be disastrous for him to win . He played through the first few moves rather carelessly . He was really not thinking at all , listening instead to the occasional muted rumble of the artillery , the steady absorbed flickering of the Coleman lantern . Once or twice he thought he heard the foliage soughing in the bivouac outside , and the sound made him gloomy . He caught himself staring at the rapt simple concentration on the General 's face . His expression was similar to the one he had assumed on the beach invasion day , or on the night they had driven in the jeep , and again it was impressivein its force and direction . The General was putting the pieces back in the box , seeming to cherish each one with his fingertips before placing it in its green plush container . " This is really my game , Robert . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What did the General want of him ? Hearn felt suddenly badg- ered ; their discussion , this game , seemed to follow out of some in exorable want behind the well-groomed and unresponsive features of the General . An inexplicable mood caught Hearn , and his sense of oppression returned , magnified a little . The air in the tent seemed heavier somehow . " Chess , " Cummings stated , " is inexhaustible . What a concentra- tion of life it is really . " Hearn 's sullenness was increasing . " I do n't think so , " he said , listening to the accents of his own clear sharp voice with something like distaste . " The thing about chess that used to intrigue me , and ended by being just boring , is that there 's nothing remotely like it in life . " " Just what do you think warfare is essential ) y ' They were off again . Hearn wanted to avoid a discussion this time , he was weary of being maneuvered by the General . He felt stub- born . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing the gray hair suddenly messed , the General 's mouth leaking blood . The im pulse was powerful and momentary . When it left , he felt merely badgered again . " I do n't know , but warfare certainly is n't chess . You might make a case for the Navy , where it 's all maneuvering on open flat surfaces with different units of fire power , where it 's all Force , Space and Time , but war is like a bloody football game . You start off with a play and it never quite works out as you figured it would . " " It 's more complicated , but it comes to the same thing . " Hearn slapped his thigh with sudden exasperation . " By God , there 're more pages to the book than you 've read . You take a squad of men or a company of men ? what the hell do you know about what goes on in their heads ? Sometimes I wonder how you can have the re- sponsibility of sending them out on something . Does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's where you 're always missing the boat , Robert . In the Army the idea of individual personality is just a hindrance . Sure , there are differences among men in any particular Army unit , but they invariablycancel each other out , and what you 're left with is a value rating . Such and such a company is good or poor , effective or ineffeclivefor such or such a mission . I work with grosser techniques , commondenominator techniques . " " You 're up so damn high you do n't see anything at all . The moral calculus on anything is too involved ever to be able decently to make a decision . " " Nevertheless , you make the decisions and they work out or they do n't . " There was something unclean about having a conversation like this , while somewhere out on the front a man might be rigid with terror in his foxhole . Hearn 's voice was a little shrill as if that terror were somehow communicated to him . " How do you work out something like this ? You have men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half . How can you calculate whether it 's better so many Itt killed and the rest get home faster , or they all stay over here , and ? t ) to pot , and have their wives cheat on them . How do you tot upuuething like that ? ? " The answer is , I do n't concern myself with that . " The Generalt t ( ked his beard again with his fingernail . He spoke after a little hesi-i ition . " What 's the matter , Hearn ? I did n't know you were married . " " I 'm not . " " Leave a girl behind , get a Dear John ? " " No , there 're no loose ends in back of me . " " Then why all this concern about women cheating ' ? It 's in theirnature to do that . " Hearn grinned with a sudden relish , a little amazed at his own audacity . " What 's the matter , sir , speaking from personal experience ? " 1 lc remembered immediately afterward that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information , for the General had never spoken about it , and he had learned it from some other officer . He regrettedthe statement he had just made , however . " Maybe from personal experience , maybe , " the General said . His 4 voice changed abruptly . " I 'd like you to remember , Robert , that every180 181rliberty you take is with my sufferance . I think you went a little too far . " " I 'm sorry . " " You can shut up . " Hearn was silent , watching the General 's face , which was remote . His eyes had contracted , looked almost as if they were supporting something about ten inches from his face . Two spots of white had formed beneath his lower lip , almost directly under the corners of his mouth . " The truth is , Robert , my wife is a bitch . " " Oh . " " She 's done just about everything she could to humiliate me . " Hearn was amazed , and then revolted . That self-pity had appearedagain in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things like that , at least not in that tone of voice . Apparently , there was the General and there was the General . " Well , I 'm sorry , sir , " he mumbled at last . The Coleman lantern was dying , and its flickers threw long shiftingdiagonals of light through the tent . " Are you , Robert , are you really ? Does anything ever touch you ? " For that single instant the General 's voice was naked . But he extended his arm and adjusted the lantern again . " You know you 're really inhuman , " the General said . " Perhaps . " " You never grant a thing , do you ? " Was that what he meant ? Hearn stared into his eyes , which were luminous at the moment , almost beseeching . He had an intuition that if he remained motionless long enough the General would slowly extendhis arm , touch his knee perhaps . No , that was ridiculous . But Hearn stood up with a sudden agitated motion , and walked a few steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood motionless for a moment , staring at the General 's cot . His cot . No , get away from there , before Cummings grabbed that interpretation . He wheeled around , and looked at the General who had not moved , had sat like a large and petrified bird , waiting . . . waiting for what must be indefinable . " I do n't know what you mean , General . " His voice fortunately was crisp. 182 " It does n't matter . " The General looked at his hands . " If you have to take a leak , Robert , for God 's sake go outside and stop pacing ' round . " " Yes , sir . " " We never did finish that argument . " This was better . " Well , what do you want me to admit , that you 're a God ? " " You know , if there is a God , Robert , he 's just like me . " " Uses the common denominator techniques . " " Exactly . " Now , they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were quiet . Between them at this instant was the uncomfortable awkwardrealization that they did not like each other at all . The conversation wavered back again , passed through a minor discussion , flitted about the campaign . After a decent interval , Hearn left him and went back to his fly tent . But in the darkness , listening to the stiff starched rustle of the leaves on the coconut trees , Hearn found it difficult to sleep . Out around him spread the miles of jungle , the endless spaces of the southern heavens with their unfamiliar stars . Something had happened tonight , but already it seemed exaggerated , out of proportion . He did not quite believe what he had heard . The scene was involuted now , something warped by a dream . Only he found himself laughing quietly on his cot . The shoddy motive . If you searched something long enough , it always turned to dirt . But even in his laughter Hearn had a picture of himself , saw his big body writhing slightly in mirth on his cot , saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this curious convulsive mirth . Once a woman who had been his mistress for a time had brought him a mirror in the morning , and said , " Look at yourself , you 're just like an ape when you 're in bed . " The mirth was a little exasperated now , his limbs almost feverish . Jesus , what a situation . But when morning came , Hearn was no longer sure that anything had happened at all. 183Chorus : WOMEN The second squad is digging a new latrine . It is midafternoon and the sun is lancing through a gap in the coconut trees and refracting brightly from the rough stubbled ground . Minetta and Polack are down in the trench , working slowly . Their shirts are removed and there is a wide band of moisture on their pants under their belts . Every ten or fifteen seconds a spadeful of earth lofts out of the hole and drops with a light pattering sound on the mound of soil beside the latrine . MINETTA : ( sighing ) That lucky wop , Toglio . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we 're lucky being back here ? Up there you can get wounded and go home . ( He snorts . ) All right , so he ca n't move his elbow so good . POLACK : Who needs an elbow to screw with ? BROWN : ( He is sitting on a stump beside the hole . ) Yeah , let me tell you guys something . Toglio 's going to go back and find his wife fooling around with anything that wears pants . There ai n't a woman you can trust . STANLEY : ( He is sprawled beside Brown . ) Oh , I do n't know , I trust my wife . There 's all kinds of women . BROWN : ( bitterly ) They 're all the same . MINETTA : Yeah , well , I trust my girl friend . POLACK : I would n't trust those bitches with a nickel . BROWN : ( picking eagerly at his snub nose ) That 's what I be- lieve .

BROWN : You think you can give her a better piece of ass than anybody else ? MINETTA : I ai n't been beat yet . BROWN : I 'll tell you something , you 're a kid . You do n't know what a good piece means . . . . Tell me something , Minetta , you ever been laid with your shoes off ? ( Stanley and Polack roar with laugh-ter . ) MINETTA : Haw , haw . BROWN : I 'll tell you what , Minetta . You just ask yourself a couple of questions . Do you think there 's anything special about you ? MINETTA : That ai n't for me to say . BROWN : Well , I 'll tell you , there ai n't . You 're just an ordinary guy . There 's not a damn thing special about any of us , not about Polackor you or Stanley or me . We 're just a bunch of GIs . ( Brown is enjoying himself . ) Okay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them every night , they 're all lovey-dovey . Oh , they ca n't do enough for ya . But the minute you go away they start thinking . MINETTA : Yeah , my Rosie thinks of me . BROWN : You bet she does . She starts thinking of how good it was to have it steady . Listen , she 's a young girl , and if she 's as beautiful as my wife is , she 's missing her good time . There 's lots of guys around , lots of four-Fs and USO commandos , and pretty soon she lets herself be talked into going out on a date . And then she dances and starts rubbing up against a gray .. . MINETTA : Rosie wrote me she do n't go out to any dances . ( Polackand Brown laugh . ) POLACK : He believes the bitches . MINETTA : Well , I tested her plenty of times , and I never caught her in a lie yet . BROWN : That just proves she 's smarter than you .

I 'll tell you what . It 's just about six A.M. now in America . She 's wakin ' up in bed with a guy who can give her just as much as you can , and she's. 184 II 185giving him the same goddam line she handed you .

STANLEY : ( looking at his watch ) It 's about our turn to dig . ( He jumps into the hole and picks up a shovel . ) Jesus , you guys are a bunch of goldbricks . Why the hell do n't you do your share ? ( He shovels furiously for a minute , and then halts . He is sweating freely . ) POLACK : ( grinning ) I 'm glad I ai n't got to worry about one of those bitches cheating on me . MINETTA : Aaah , fug you . You think you 're pretty goddam good. 7AFTER the night when the Japanese failed to cross the river , the first squad remained in its position for three days . On the fourth day , 1st Battalion advanced a half mile and recon moved up with A Company . Their new outpost was on the crest of a hill which looked down into a tiny valley of kunai grass ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stringing barbed wire , and making routine patrols . The front had become quiet . Nothing happened to the platoon , and they seldom saw any other men except for the platoon of A Company whose positions were on an adjoining hill a few hundred yards away . The bluffs of Watamai Range were still on their right , quite close , and in the late afternoon the cliffs hung over them like a wave of surf about to break . The men in recon spent their days sitting in the sun on top of the hill . There was nothing to do except eat their rations and sleep and write letters and stand guard in their foxholes . The mornings were pleasant and new , but by afternoon the men were sullen and drowsy , Every day a ration detail of three men would trudge over to the hill on which the adjacent platoon of A Company was bivouacked , and return with a box of 10-in-1 rations and two five-gallon jerricans of water . The trip was always uneventful and the men did not dislike it , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance to talk to someone other than the men in their squad . On the last day of the week , Croft and Red and Gallagher filed down their hill , wove through the six-foot kunai grass in the valley beneath them , emerged into a bamboo grove , and from there followed the trail that led to A Company . They filled their empty water cans , strapped them to pack boards , and talked for a few minutes with some f the men in A Company before starting back . Croft was leading them , and when he reached the beginning of the trail he halted , and motioned to Red and Gallagher to come forward . " Listen , " he whispered . " You men were making too goddam nuch noise coming down the hill . Just ' cause this is a short distance and you got a little weight on your back don ' mean you 're supposed to wallow round like a bunch of goddam pigs . " 186 187 " Okay , " Gallagher muttered sullenly . " C'm on , let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly spoken to each other all week . The three men filed slowly down the trail keeping a distance of ten yards between them . Red found himself treading warily , and he realized with a trace of anger that Croft 's command was influencing him . He walked along for many yards trying to determine whether he was afraid of Croft 's anger or his caution came from habit . He was still debating this when he saw Croft stop abruptly , and creep through some bushes on the side of the trail . Croft turned around and looked at Gallagher and him , and then waved his arm forward in a slow silent motion . Red looked at his face ; Croft 's mouth and eyes were expressionlessbut there was a poise and tension about his entire body which was imperative . Red crouched and moved up beside him . When the three of them were together , Croft held his finger to his mouth , and then pointed through a break in the foliage beside the trail . About twenty-five yards away there was a tiny hollow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by jungle , but in the middle of it three Japanese soldiers were sprawled on the ground , resting with their heads on their packs , and a fourth soldier was sitting beside them with his rifle across his lap , his chin resting on his hand . Croft looked at them for a long tense second , and then stared fiercely at Red and Gal- . lagher . His jaw had tightened , and a small lump of cartilage beneath , his ear quivered once or twice . Very carefully , he slipped off his pack board and laid it noiselessly on the ground . " We ca n't get through that brush without making a noise , " he whispered almost soundlessly . " Ah 'm gon na throw a grenade , and then we all rush together . Y'understand ? " They nodded dumbly , stripping their packs . Then Red peered through the yards of brush that separated them from the draw . If the grenade failed to kill the Japs , all three of them would be exposed as ' they went charging through the brush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against everything in the situation . It was unbelievable . He always had a similar reaction when he knew he would be in combat in a few seconds . It always seemed impossible he would move or fire his gun , expose his life , and yet he always advanced . Red wasfeeling now the anger that always followed this , a rage at his desire to avoid the moment to come . I 'm as good as any man jack , he told himselfnumbly . He looked at Gallagher , whose face was white , and Red felt a surprising contempt although he knew that he was himself equally frightened . Croft 's nostrils had dilated , and the pupils of his e ' es looked cold and very black ; Red hated him because Croft could enjoy this . Croft slipped a grenade out of his belt , and pulled the safety pin . Red looked through the foliage again and stared at the backs of the Japanese soldiers . He could see the face of the man who was sitting up , and it added to the unreality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Japanese soldier had a pleasant bland face with wide temples and a heavy jaw ; he looked cow-like and his thick hands appeared sturdy and calloused . Red had for a moment an odd detachedpleasure , quite incongruous , which stemmed from the knowledge that he was unobserved . And yet all of this was mixed with dread , and the certainty that none of it was real . He could not believe that in a few seconds the soldier with the broad pleasant face was goingto die . Croft opened his fingers , and the handle of the grenade snapped off and spun a few feet away . The fuse in the grenade popped , and a sputtering noise destroyed the silence . The Japanese heard it , sprang to their feet with sudden cries , and moved a few steps uncertainlyback and forth in the tiny circle of the draw . Red watched the expression of terror on one soldier 's face , heard the sizzling of the grenade , the sound mixing with the ringing in his ears and the poundingof his heart , and then dropped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Red grasped his tommy gun and stared intentlyat a blade of grass . He had time before the grenade exploded to wish he had cleaned his gun that morning . He heard a terrifying shriek , thought once of the soldier with the broad face , and then found himself afoot , crashing and stumbling through the brush . The three of them halted on the edge of the draw and looked down . All four of the Japanese soldiers were lying motionless in the trampled kunai grass . Croft gazed at them and spat softly . " Go down and take a look , " he told Red. 189Red slid down the bank to the gully where the bodies lay sprawled . He could tell at a glance that two of the men were certainly dead ; one of them reposed on his back with his hands clawed over the bloody mash of what had once been his face , and the other was crumpledon his side with a great rent in his chest . The other two men had fallen on their stomachs and he could see no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to him . " They 're dead . " " Finish them off . " Red felt a pulse of anger . If it 'd been anyone else but me , the bastard would have done it himself , he thought . He stood over one of the motionless bodies , and brought the sights of his tommy gun to bear on the back of the soldier 's head . He took a little breath , and then fired a burst . He felt nothing except the rising quivering motion of the gun in his hands . After he had fired , he noticed that it was the soldier who had been sitting with his rifle across his thighs . There was an instant in which he hovered on the lip of an intense anxiety , but he repressed it and strode over to the last soldier. *1 ' As he looked down upon him , Red felt a wash of many transient subtle emotions . If he had been asked , he might have said , " I did n't feel a goddam thing , " but the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was beating rapidly . He had an intense distaste for what he was about to do , and yet as he stared at the body and pointed his sights at the man 's neck , he was feeling a pleasurable anticipation . He tightened his finger on the trigger , taking up the slack , tensing himself for the moment when he would fire and the slugs would make round little holes in a cluster , and the corpse would twitch and shake under the force of the bullets . He pictured all those sensations , pulled the trigger . . . and nothing happened . His gun had jammed . He started tt work the bolt when the body underneath him suddenly rolled over . It took Red almost a second to realize that the Jap was alive . The two men stared at each other with blank twitching faces , and then the Jap sprang to his feet . There was a fraction of a second in which Red could have knocked him down with the stock of his gun , but the frustrationhe had felt when the gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soldier was alive , combined to paralyze190him completely . He watched the soldier stand up , move a step toward him , and then Red 's muscles worked suddenly , and he hurled his gun at the Jap . It missed , and the two soldiers continued to stare at each other , not three yards apart . Red could never forget the Jap 's face . It was gaunt and the skin /as drawn tightly over the eyes and cheeks and nostrils so that he had a hungry searching look . He had never seen a man 's face so intensely ; his gaze concentrated until he could detect every imperfection in the man 's skin . He saw blackheads on the Jap 's forehead , and a tiny postule on the side of his nose , and drops of sweat in the deep hollows under his eyes . Perhaps they stared at each other for half a second , and then the Jap unsheathed his bayonet , and Red turned and ran . He saw the other man lunging toward him , and Red thought inanely , Horror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder , " Get him , GET HIM , CROFT ! " Then Red tripped , and lay motionless on the ground , half stunned . He was trying to ready himself for the flash of pain the knife would cause as it pierced his back , and he held his breath . He heard his heart beat once , and then once more . His alertness was returning , and he poised his body . His heart beat again , and again , and again . Abruptly , he realized that nothing was going to happen . Croft 's clear cold voice grated in his ear . " Goddam , Red , how long you gon na lay on the ground ? " Red rolled over and sat up . He repressed a groan with difficulty , but the effort made him shudder . " Jesus , " he said . " What do you think of your boy friend ? " Croft asked softly . The Jap was standing several yards away with his hands in the air . He had dropped the bayonet , and it lay at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Red looked at the Japanese soldier , and for an instant their eyes met . Both men looked away , as if they had each been caught in somethingshameful . Red realized suddenly how weak he felt . Yet even now he could not admit any weakness to Croft . " W .. took you guys so goddam long ? " he asked . " Got down as fast as we could , " Croft said . Gallagher spoke up abruptly . His face was white and his mouth191trembled . " I was gon na shoot the mother-fugger but you were in the way . " Croft laughed quietly , and then said , " Ah guess we frightene* him more than you , Red . He damn sure stopped running after yoi , when he saw us . " Red found himself shuddering again . He felt a grudged admiration for Croft , and with it a great deal of resentment at being in his debt . For a second or two he tried to find some way to thank him , but he could not utter the words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Red said . Croft 's expression seemed to change . A glint of excitement formed in his eyes . " Why do n't you head on back , Red ? " he suggested . " Gallagher and me 'll follow you in a couple of minutes . " Red forced himself to say , " Want me to take the Jap ? " There was nothing he wanted less . He found himself still unable to look at the soldier . " No , " Croft said . " Gallagher and me 'll take care of him . " Red realized there was something odd about Croft at this moment . " I can take him okay , " he said . " No , we 'll take care of him . " Red looked once at the bodies lying limp in the green draw . Alreadya few insects were buzzing over the corpse who had lost his face . Everything that had happened to him seemed unreal again . He looked at the soldier from whom he had fled , and already his face seemed anonymous and small . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to meet his eyes . Jesus , I feel pooped , he thought . His legs quivereda little as he picked up his tommy gun . He felt too tired to say anything more . " Okay , see you up on the hill , " he muttered . For some obscure reason , he knew he should not leave , and as he walked away down the trail he felt again the curious shame and guilt the Japanese soldier had caused him . That Croft 's a bastard , he told himself . Red felt leaden , in fever . When he had gone , Croft sat down on the ground and lit a cigarette . He smoked intently without saying anything . Gallagher sat192beside him , looking at the prisoner . " Let 's get rid of him and get back , " he blurted suddenly . " Hold your water , " Croft told him softly . " What 's the use of torturin ' the poor bastard ? " Gallagher asked , " He ai n't complainin ' , " Croft said . But then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly to his knees and began to sob in a high-pitched voice . Every few seconds he would turn to them . and extend his hands with pleadingmotions , and then he would beat his arms on the ground as if he despaired of making them understand . Out of the spate of words , Gallagher could distinguish something that sounded like " kood-sigh , I:cod-sigh . " Gallagher was a little hysterical from the abruptness with which the combat had begun and ended . His momentary compassion for the prisoner lapsed and was replaced by an intense irritation . " Let 's cut out that ' kood-sigh ' shit , " he roared at the Jap . The soldier was silent for a moment , and then began to plead again . His voice had a desperate urgency which rasped Gallagher 's senses . " You look like a fuggin Yid with all that handwaving , " he shouted . " Let 's keep it down , " Croft said . The soldier approached them , and Gallagher looked uncomfortablyinto his black pleading eyes . A powerful fishy stench arose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gallagher said . Croft kept staring at the Jap . An emotion was obviously working through his mind , for the lump of cartilage under his ear kept pulsing . Croft actually was not thinking at all ; he was bothered by an intensesense Red , he had been anticipating the quick lurching spasms of the body when the bullets would crash into it , and now he felt an intense dissatisfaction . He looked at his cigarette , and on an impulse he handed it to the Japanese soldier . " What 're you doing that for ? " Gallagher asked . " Let him smoke . " The prisoner puffed at it eagerly , and yet self-consciously . His193eyes kept darting suspiciously at Croft and Gallagher , and the sweat glistened on his cheeks . " Hey , you , " Croft said , " sit down . " The Jap looked at him with uncomprehending eyes . " Sit down . " Croft made some motions with his hands , and the prisoner squatted with his back against a tree . " You got anything to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chocolate bar from the ration . " " Let 's have it , " Croft said . He took the bar from Gallagher and handed it to the soldier , who looked at him with dull eyes . Croft made eating motions with his hand , and the prisoner , comprehending , ripped the paper away , and wolfed down the chocolate . " Goddam , he sure is hungry , " Croft said . " What the fug are you doin ' it for ? " Gallagher asked . He felt exasperated to the point of tears . He had been saving the candy for over a day , and its loss pained him ; moreover , he was vacillating betweenirritability at the prisoner and a grudged compassion . " The dumb bastard sure is skinny , " he said with the superior affection he might have used if he saw a mongrel dog shivering in the rain . But then immediately afterward he watched the last piece of chocolate disappear in the Jap 's mouth , and he muttered angrily , " What a goddampig he is . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross the river . He felt a shiver work its way through him , and he stared for a long time at the prisoner . He felt an intense emotion toward him which made him clench his teeth . But what it was , he could not have said . He removed his canteen and took a drink . He saw the prisoner watching him as he gulped down the water , and on an impulse he handed him the canteen . " Go ahead , drink , " he said . Croft gazed at him as he swallowed with long eager draughts . " I 'm a sonofabitch , " Gallagher said . " What got in ya ? " Croft did not answer . He was staring at the prisoner , who had finished drinking . There were a few tears of joy in the Jap 's face and he smiled suddenly and pointed to his breast pocket . Croft extracted a wallet , and opened it . There was a picture of the Japanese soldier in civilian dress and beside him was his wife and two little children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then made two gestures with his hand above the ground to indicate how tall his children had grown . Gallagher looked at the picture , and felt a pang . For an instant he remembered his wife and wondered what his child would look like when it was born . With a shock he realized that his wife might be in labor now . For some reason which he did not understand he said suddenly to the Jap , " I 'm gon na have a kid in a couple of days . " The prisoner smiled politely , and Gallagher pointed angrily to himself and then held his hands extended and about nine inches apart . " Me , " he said , " me . " " Ahhhhhh , " the prisoner said . " Chiisai ! " " Yeah , cheez-igh , " Gallagher said . The prisoner shook his head slowly , and smiled again . Croft came up to him , and gave him another cigarette . The Japanese soldier bowed low , and accepted the match . " Arigato , arigato , domo arigato , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intense excitement . There were tears in the prisoner 's eyes again , and Croft looked at them dispassionately . He gazed once about the little draw , and watched a fly crawl over the mouth of one of the corpses . The prisoner had taken a deep puff and was leaning back now against the trunk of the tree . His eyes had closed , and for the first time there was a dreamy expression on his face . Croft felt a tension work itself into his throat and leave his mouth dry and bitter and demanding . His mind had been entirely empty until now , but abruptly he brought up his rifle and pointed it at the prisoner 's head . Gallagher started to protest as the Jap opened his eyes . The prisoner did not have time to change his expression before the shot crashed into his skull . He slumped forward , and then rolled on his side . He was still smiling but he looked silly now . Gallagher tried to speak again but was incapable of it . He felt an awful fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , God save Mary , God save Mary , he repeated to himself without thinking of the meaning of the words . Croft stared for almost a minute at the Jap . His pulse was slow. 195ing down and he felt the tension ease in his throat and mouth . He realized suddenly that a part of his mind , very deeply buried , had known he was going to kill the prisoner from the moment he had sent Red on ahead . He felt quite blank now . The smile on the dead man 's face amused him , and a trivial rill of laughter emitted from his lips . " Goddam , " he said . He thought once again of the Japanese crossing the river , and he prodded the body with his foot . " Goddam , " he said , " that Jap sure died happy . " The laughter swelled more strongly insidehim . Later that morning recon received an order to return to the rear . They folded their tents , stowed their ponchos in their jungle packs , filled their canteens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , and ate a ration while they waited for other troops to relieve them . About noon a squad from A Company moved into their outpost , and recon descended their hill and took the trail leading back to 1st Battalion . It was a long hike over a muddy lane in the jungle , and after a half hour they settled down into the tedium and weariness of trudging through the mud . A few of them were jubilant ; Martinez and Wyman had a pressure removed from them , and Wilson was thinking about whisky . Croft was taciturn , reflective , and Gallagher and Red were nervous and irritable and started frequently at every unexpected noise . Red found that he was continually turning around to look behind him . They reached 1st Battalion in an hour , and after a short rest they moved on along a lateral trail to 2nd Battalion . It was midafternoon when they arrived there , and Croft received orders for the squad to bivouac on the battalion perimeter for the night . The men cast off their packs , withdrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a machine-gun emplacement in front of them and they did not bother to dig any more holes . They sat about resting and talking , and gradually they felt the tension of the past week coming back . " Goddam , " Wilson said , " that sure was a lonely place they put us . Ah tell ya Ah jus ' wouldn ' wanta spend a honeymoon there . " Wilson was feeling restless . There was a tickle in his throat and his legs and arms felt drawn , overworked . " Man , " he announced , " Ah 196uld sure use a nice big bottle of likker . " He stretched his legs andwned a little desperately . " Ah tell ya what , " he said , " Ah heard they 's a mess sergeant over here that makes a decent drink for a man . " None of the men answered him , and he got to his feet . " Ah think Ah 'm gon na take a little walk and see if Ah can manipilate some likerfor us . " Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na use foimoney ? I thought you lost it all up on the hill . " They had been playingpoker every day . Wilson was hurt . " Listen , Red , " he confided , " they ai n't ever atime when Ah been broke . Ah do n't claim to be no poker player , but Ah 'll bet ya they ai n't many men who can say they busted me in a game . " Actually he had lost all his money , but an obscure pride kept him from admitting it . At this moment , Wilson was not thinking of what he would do if he could find some whisky without having the money to purchase it . He was interested only in finding the whisky . Jus ' lemme see some likker , he thought , an ' Ah 'll fin ' a way to drinkIt . He got up and walked away . In about fifteen minutes he returnedgrinning . He sat down beside Croft and Martinez , and began to poke at the ground with a twig he was holding . " Listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ole mess sergeant here who 's got a still out in the woods yonder . Ah was talkin ' to him , and Ah manipilated him into settin ' us a price . " " How much ? " Croft asked . " Well , Ah 'll tell ya , " Wilson said , " it 's kinda high . . . but it'sgood stuff . He been usin ' canned peaches and apricots and raisins with lots of sugar and yeast . He let me sample it , an ' it 's goddam good . " " How much ? " Croft asked again . " Well , now , he wants twenty-five of them pounds for three canteensfull . Ah never could figger out them damn pounds , but Ahreckon it ai n't much over fifty dollars . " Croft spat . " Fifty dollars , hell . It 's all of eighty bucks . That'spretty steep for jus ' three canteens . " Wilson nodded . " Yeah , but then what the hell , we 're jus ' gonnaget our haids blown off tomorrow . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can get Red and Gallagher in on it , and then it jus ' makes 197five pound apiece ' cause they 'll be five of us . Five time five , twentyfive , ai n't it ? " Croft deliberated . " You get Red and Gallagher in , and Martinez and me 'll put up . " Wilson went over to talk to Gallagher , and left him with five Australian pounds in his pocket . He stopped to chat with Red , and mentioned the price . Red exploded . " Five pounds apiece for three lousy canteens ? Wilson , you can get five canteens for twenty-five pounds . " " Now , you know you cai n't , Red . " Red swore . " Where the hell 's your five pounds , Wilson ? " Wilson took out Gallagher 's money . " That 's it , Red . " " It would n't be one of the other men 's money , would it ? " Wilson sighed . " Honestly , Red , Ah don ' know how the hell you can think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment he was completely sincere . " All right , here 's five , " Red growled . He still thought Wilson was lying , but it did n't really matter . He needed to get drunk anyway , and he did not have the energy to find some liquor for himself . His body stiffened for a moment in a duplication of the panic that had caught him when he was walking alone on the trail and had heard the shot from Croft 's gun . " All we ever do is screw each other anyway , what the hell . " He could not shake the death of the Japanese prisoner . It had been wrong somehow . When the Jap had n't been killed the first time , he rated being taken in as a prisoner . But it was more than that . He should have stayed . The whole week up there , the night on the river , the killings . He sighed heavily . Let Wilson have his good time ; it was getting hard to find . Wilson collected the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty canteens , and went off to see the mess sergeant . He paid the twenty pounds he had promoted , and returned with the four canteens filled . One of them he hid under a folded blanket in his pup tent , and then he joined the other men and unhitched the canteensfrom his belt . " We better drink ' em up fast , " he said . " That alcohol might eat on the metal . " Gallagher took a swig . " What the fug is it made of ? " he asked 198 " Oh , it 's good stuff , " Wilson assured him . He took a long drink and exhaled pleasurably . The liquor flushed its way through his throat and chest and settled warmly in his stomach . He felt tendrils of pleasurewinding through his limbs and a joyous warmth began to relax his body . " Man , that does me good , " he said . With the drink inside him , and the knowledge that there would be more to follow , Wilson felt mellow , he had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " whisky is the kind of thing a man ought n't to do without . That 's the trouble with the goddam war ; a man cai n't get ofl by hisself , and do the kind of things where he had a good time for hisself and do n't hurt no one a damn bit . " Croft grunted inaudibly and wiped the mouth of the canteen before he drank . Red sifted some dirt through his fingers . The liquor had been sweet and raw ; it had rasped his throat and the irritation expandedthrough his body . He rubbed the side of his lumpish red nose and spat angrily . " No one 's gon na ask you what you want to do , " he told Wilson . " They just send you out to get your ass blown off . " For an instant , he saw again the dead bodies in the green draw , the naked look of lacerated flesh . " Do n't kid yourself , " he said , " a man 's no more important than a goddam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms of the Japaneseprisoner had twitched for a second after Croft had shot him . " Just like wringing the neck of a fuggin chicken , " he muttered surlily . Martinez looked up . His face was drawn , and there were shadows under his eyes . " Why not you keep quiet ? " he asked . " We see same things you do . " His voice , almost always quiet and polite , had an angry strident note which amazed Gallagher and silenced him . " Let 's pass the canteen around , " Wilson suggested . He tilted it upward , and drank the last inch . " Guess we got to open another one , " he sighed . " We all paid up for this , " Croft said . " Let 's see we drink the same amount . " Wilson giggled . They sat about in a circle , passing the canteen from time to time and talking in slow indifferent voices which began to blur before the second canteen was finished . The sun was dropping toward the west , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **29;3585;TOOLONG III6 RANDMOTHER sat in her armchair by the wood fire in the drawing room . In old days she had always got up to receive her visitors , but nowadays , with her rheumatismso much worse than it used to be , she could no longer rise gracefully from her chair , so she remained contentedly seated . She had always been beautiful , was beautiful now , and had every intention of remaining beautiful until the end of her days . She did not in the least begrudge either the spending of a great deal of time and trouble upon the outer facade of beauty , or the curtailing of her activities by the elimination of those which she could no longer accomplish with grace . It seemed to her children and grandchildren that she did not mind growing old . There was nothing of desperation in the firm hold she kept upon her beauty ; it was rather that she appeared to be taking good care of something entrusted to her care , but did not seem to regard it as an integral part of her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you , " said Grandmother . I Ier voice had deepened with old age , but lost none of its eager warmth , and it had gained that lilt of music that comes into the voices of the old when they are without querulousness . " You 're alone , dear ? " " Yes , Grandmother , " replied Nadine . " Did you expect menot to be ? " " I just thought , dear , that perhaps George and the children might have come with you after all , " said Grandmother , trying to keep the disappointment out of her voice . " The whole family would have been too much to inflict on you , " said Nadine lightly . " And George ca n't leave the War Office . I told you that , you know , when you rang up ... . Darling , how are you ? " And Nadine bent to kiss her mother-in-law40with mingled love , resentment , and exasperation . She did most deeply love Lucilla , but she did not forget that in the past , when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grandmother had won , and she could never quite accept with acquiescence , as did the rest of the family , the fact that this frail old woman , sitting here in this absurd old-fashioned room and never even raising her voice , molded the entire Eliot clan as wax in her fingers . Nadine was a woman of strong character , and the knowledge that since she had taken the name of Eliot she had scarcely ever had her own way made her at times feel like a cat with its fur stroked backwards . Grandmother , Lucilla Eliot , had spent practically the whole of the greatest war in history either sitting in her armchair by the fire , or on really hot days sitting in her wicker chair out in the garden under the ilex tree , the Bastard lying at her feet with his chin propped on one of her shoes and Pooh-Bah sitting beside her . She had left the fire or the ilex tree only to go to church , bed , to meals in the dining room , or to pay a rare call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her children and grandchildren that dear Grandmother had felt the war very little . Nothing that happened , not even the eruption of evacuees into her home , had ruffled outward serenity , and she had made very little comment upon it . The change in her appearance that had taken place during the six years they put down merely to the passing of the years . Old people did not feel things very much , they said , and what a comfort that was . But as a matter of fact the six years of the war had been for Lucilla a time of mental and spiritual activity and of suffering , as great as any she had known .... And she had had to go through it all without her beloved old maid , Ellen , who had always been through everything with her before , and whom she had loved more than anyone had any idea of , except perhapsHilary . Damerosehay , which nearly twenty years ago had been bought by Lucilla as a sanctuary where the whole family could come to be remade when the turmoil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had through long periods of the war been obliged to say good-by to its peace . The English Channel was to the south of the marshes , the estuary , leading to one of the greatest41of the naval ports , bounded them upon the east . Enemy planes had passed over day and night , guns had roared out at sea , and the old house had rocked to the explosions of bombs falling in the marshes . Lucilla was a brave woman , and physical danger had no terrorsfor her , but quiet was essential to her well-being , and she had suffered excruciating torture from the racket . Through long noisy nights she had lain rigid in her bed , her hands gripping the sheets upon either side of her , trying not to cry just because the noise made her feel so terribly exhausted . Her one desire upon these occasions had been to be let alone , but she had never been let alone . Her daughter Margaret , and any visitors , evacuees , or servants who might be with them at the time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lest she should be frightened .. . . At least so they had said .... It was , as it happened , they who had been frightened , and their subconsciousreason for coming had been to stay themselves upon her courage . This they had done , exhausting her still further . But she had given no signs of her exhaustion . She had kept them laughing through the night , telling them tales of her youth , and when the raid was over , she had made them tea with her little electric kettle and sent them back to bed to sleep soundly until morning , while she lay awake too tired to sleep . But the noise , and the necessity for bolstering up the others , had been as nothing to the torturing anxiety of those years . In the First World War Lucilla had lost two of her five sons , one of them her son Maurice , the great love of her life , and had suffered great anxiety for the other three . In this war , of the three sons left her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been fighting , but the two sons of her son Stephen , the lawyer , were in the services , and also David , Maurice 's only son , whom she had brought up from his babyhood and who meant to her quite simply the whole of her world . Stephen 's sons had been kil led , one in Norway and one in Greece , and day by day she had waited for news of David 's death in the air . The first war had taken his father ; this one would take him . On the first day of the war she had made up her mind to that , arming herself beforehand to face what would be the worst thing that could possibly happen to her . The fact that it had n't happened , 42that by some miracle David had come through safely , had not altered the fact that for six years she had expected it to happen . Through every day of those six years she had never heard a ring at the bell or a step in the hall without steeling herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticlimaxes , when the ring at the bell had been only the butcher , and the step only Margaret back from her Red Cross working party earlier than usual , had been in themselves exhausting . And then , for a woman of Lucilla 's vivid imagination and deep sympathies , her own personal sorrows and anxieties had not been the only ones that she had had to bear . She had borne also as much as she was able to of the sorrow of the world . For she had learned really to pray . For the first time in her life she had discovered prayer to be not what it had hitherto been to her , " the occupation of the praying mind or the sound of the voice praying , " but a ceaseless offering up of the whole personality , of every thought and word and action , as sacrifice . And it was exceedingly tiring ... . So that what with one thing and another Lucilla had spent a very active six years .... But sitting in her chair before the fire or under the ilex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the evacuee children who surged about her , she had been careful to give no sign , either by word or look , of the extent of her endurance . It had been her opinion that in wartime old people were a great nuisance , and the best thing they could do was to keep , at whatever cost , a tranquil exterior , and get on with their knitting . She was too humble a woman to assess her wartime activity at its true value . But it had left its mark , and Nadine , who had not seen Grandmotherfor more than a year now , was saddened at the change in her . She had to hold her tall slender figure so rigidly now to keep herself from sagging that she had lost some of her grace ; her blue eyes were sunken and her face was deeply lined . But she was still most beautiful , the indefinable elements of her beauty , her elegance and dignity and luminous vitality , seeming to have deepened in quality now that the more obvious lovelinesshad faded . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Nadine deeply touching because she guessed at what cost it was achieved . There was no Ellen now , and Margaretwas the clumsiest creature who ever lived , so it must have43been she herself who had dressed her lovely white hair so perfectly , and sewn such spotless lace at the neck and wrists of her simple black frock with the faint scent of verbena clinging to its folds ; the task could have been neither quick nor easy for her rheumaticky hands . " You 're just the same , Grandmother , " lied Nadine , as she bent to kiss her , speaking with as much intent to comfort herself as to please Grandmother . Lucilla smiled as she returned the kiss , and did not contradictthe lie . Indeed she answered it with another . " So are you , my dear . " Then they looked at each other and laughed with complete sympathy and comprehension , two beautiful women who had a very low opinion of the stark realities of life and a very high opinion of covering them up with a little persiflage . Nadine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , armies had vanished into oblivion , great cities had been wiped off the face of the earth , but the Damerosehay drawingroom had not changed the position of a single ornament . The Dresden shepherds and shepherdesses , lambs and cupids , stood just as they had always stood upon the mantelpiece , gay patches of color against the great carved overmantel ; the Sheraton chairs stood in the same positions upon the same Persian rugs ; the stiff eighteenth-century chintz that covered the sofa and armchairs was the same ; and bowls of flowers stood where they had always stood . The drawing room was not what it had been seven years ago ; there were many more darns in the rugs , more cracks in the chintz , and the dents and scratches presented to the chair legs by the kicking feet of the grandchildrenhad been added to by those of the evacuees . Like Lucilla it had suffered a slight tarnishing of the outward facade of its beauty , but the essence of it was unchanged . X21There was a peculiar rattling sound in the distance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Lucilla , and her delicate old face went suddenly pink with annoyance . " A trolley ? " ejaculated Nadine . " A trolley , at Damerosehay ? " " Yes , dear , " said Grandmother . " While dear Ellen lived I44always had afternoon tea brought in properly on the tea tray , which was then placed upon my tea table . But now that dear Ellen is dead Margaret brings in tea , and she 's gone and got this trolley thing . She picked it up cheap at a sale without telling me ; she  --  but there , dear , what 's the use , one ca n't hear oneself think . " The rattle and bang of the trolley approaching over the unevenstone flags of the hall were indeed shattering sounds , even through the closed door . Lucilla shivered dramatically , Nadine tensed a little , and Hilary moved to open the door with a twinkle of amusement in his eye . Margaret entered , deprecating , shy , aware that Lucilla hated the trolley ( though she never said so ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something about her clothes and hair ( though she 'd never said so ) , unhappy because of their disapproval , yet obstinately determined to stick both to the trolley and to the style of dress and hairdress to which she was accustomed . A gentle yielding to the wishes of others was of the essence of Margaret , yet , very rarely , she would launch out on her own in the most startling way , as witness that sudden departure one afternoon ( without telling Lucilla ) to a sale , the having her fancy caught by a particularly hideous trolley , the standing up all by her shy self and bidding for it , the wheeling of it home through the lanes ( she who so dreaded to be thought absurd ) , and the subsequent using of it in the teeth of Lucilla 's unspoken disapproval . Lucilla could not understandthese outbreaks of Margaret 's .. . nor could Margaret . ... Hilary could . She had been a slave all her life long to Damerosehay and the Eliots , but in these little startling outbreaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made , she went free . He set the door wide and smiled reassuringly at his sister . Lucilla was the great love of his life , but after her came Margaret . For besides his reverence for her selflessness , with its complete freedom from the least taint of bitterness or selfpity , his delight in her sudden flashes of independence , he had for her a deep fellow feeling . She , as well as he , was one of the homely Eliots . Margaret was now sixty-three , though she did not look more than fifty . Like all keen gardeners she had become weather-45beaten at an early age , so that when she got to fifty she could not well become more so than she was , and it merely remained for the coming years to keep her young with the joy in flowers and sunshine and good earth that grew increasingly day by day . She was tall , but bony and awkward in her movements , not soft and graceful like Lucilla . Her thick , rough gray hair was cut short in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tidy . She wore heather-colored tweeds , faded by the sun and pulled out of shape by wind and rain , and a jumper that had been badly knitted by herself in a shade of bright yellow that was all wrong with her tweeds . She liked knitting , though she did not do it very well , and she loved bright colors , though she was without discrimination in their use . Her woolen stockings were much darned and her thick shoes made almost as much noise as the trolley . " Hilary , " said Lucilla , " help Margaret lift that trolley over the rugs . It has such silly little wheels , and they catch , and then the milk spills on the tray cloth , and if there 's one thing I ca n't stand it 's a stained tray cloth . " She spoke with deep apprehension , as though yet another international disaster threatened , and Margaret 's face , bent in agonized concentration over the trolley , might have been that of a surgeon absorbed in a task of life or death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the trolley too high and sent a cascade of little buns falling to the floor . Lucilla opened her mouth to tell Hilary that he had n't been paying attention to what he was doing , and to remind Margaret of how many , many times in the past she had told her no/ to pile the plates too full , remembered just in time that her children were grown-up now , both in their sixties , and said nothing .... It was strange , very strange , to be the mother of old people ... because she herself felt so much younger than they were . " How are you , Margaret ? " asked Nadine . Margaret started and flushed scarlet , because she had been so absorbed in the trolley that she had entirely forgotten to greet Nadine . " I 'm quite well , dear , " she said in her soft gentle voice , a very young voice , oddly touching in contrast with her elderly46appearance . " And you ? You look tired out . And the children ? Is London agreeing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " George , when he wrote , said something about Ben having a cough , " put in Lucilla softly . " Just the remains of a cold . The children are splendid , " said Nadine decisively , giving Margaret a dutiful kiss . " And if I look tired it 's not London but the splendidness of the children . " Margaret shrank a little from the kiss , not from lack of af- fection , but because she hesitated to touch the exquisite flower- like face of her sister-in-law with her own weather-beaten cheek . She adored Nadine 's beauty , even as she adored the beauty of the flowers in the garden . Nadine , misunderstanding the shrinkwassaddened by it . Though she regarded Margaret as an ancient museum piece beyond her comprehension , she yet rever- enced her . She would have been glad if they could have achieved real friendship . But she knew they never would . Margaret poured the tea into Lucilla 's delicate Worcester cups , slopping it into the saucers a little as she did so , Hilary retrieved the buns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea with the dogs at their feet . Lucilla nibbled at one of Mar- garet 's rather thick pieces of bread and butter , surreptitiously gave her bun bit by bit to the Bastard because somehow she could never fancy food that had been on the floor , and tried not to remember how dainty the teas had been when dear Ellen was alive . Margaret worked so very hard , with only intermittent assistance from Big Village to help her , and was so desperately anxious to please always that it did not seem loyal to her to hanker after the old days ... . But it was hard not to when one 's tea was slopped over into the saucer .... Wrenching her mind away from the longing for Ellen that was always with her , like a persistent toothache , she tried to pay attention to what the others were saying . But they were talking about the deplorable state of the world , about that terrible bomb , about famine and inflation and chaos and death , and her mind shied away from their talk like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , at eighty-six , except pray , and in be- tween her prayers , now that the war was over , she wished they would let her forget sometimes that things had not turned out47as well as one had hoped , and enjoy the things that were left : the spring sunshine slanting into the quiet room and lighting up the flowers , the lovely ripe corn color of Pooh-Bah 's coat , the hot tea , the log fire burning on the hearth , whispering and fragrant , the feel of the dear old Bastard 's chin resting on her shoe , the sound of the sea coming in the pauses of their talk . " Do n't ! " she cried to them suddenly . " It 's this that matters  --  this ! " " What , Mother ? " asked Margaret , who never could follow the working of another 's mind unless it was explained to her very carefully and at great length . " Beauty is truth ? " asked Hilary , coming a little nearer . But Nadine , without words , stretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had both been married and borne children . Lucilla knew always , and Nadine knew in her more domesticated moments , that it was homemaking that mattered . Every home was a brick in the great wall of decent living that men erected over and over again as a bulwark against the perpetual flooding in of evil . But women made the bricks , and the durableness of each civilization depended upon their quality , and it was no good weakening oneself for the brick-making by thinking too much about the flood . " You 'd scarcely recognize the twins now , they 've grown so much , " said Nadine , watching for the little light of happiness that always sprang into Lucilla 's eyes at any mention of her beloved grandchildren . The flame leaped , then died . " It 's been such a long time since I 've seen them ! Or Ben or Tommy or Caroline , either , " mourned I.uciIla . " Why , Grandmother , George brought the older children to stay with you three months ago ! " said Nadine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's a very long time , and he did not bring the twins . " " Only because they had chicken pox , Grandmother . " " George and the children ought to have come down with you , " said Margaret . " I thought it would be best to interview Jill by myself , " saidNadine . " Also , I wanted a rest from George and the children . " Margaret , who had lost the lover of her girlhood in the48First World War and had idealized marriage ever since , looked shocked , but Lucilla agreed placidly . " One does . " " Who 's looking after George and the children ? " asked Hilary . " My cousin Pamela Lyson is coping . She loves it for a few days , but not longer . She 's elderly . She goes to pieces on the evening of the fourth day , but I 'll be back then . " " I 'm so glad you 're going to have Jill , dear , " said Lucilla . " But I do n't know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview her . " " As soon as I saw your advertisement in the paper , dear  --  and it was lucky that I did see it , for you never told me that you were inserting it  --  I went over at once to see Jill . Hilary drove me over . I remembered her as a sweet girl , but I was afraid the war might have changed her . But it has n't . She 's just the same , and exactly the influence the children need . I showed her your advertisement and told her to answer it , and you should have seen her joy at the idea of being with her dear Ben and Tommy and Caroline again . The only difficulty , dear , is that being a country-bred girl I do not know whether she will want to take a permanent post in Town . She was in London for a time during the war and it does n't agree with her , she says , and I 'm sure I do n't wonder . So noisy and dirty now . Not like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told her I did not think it would be long now before you were all settled in the country . " Nadine flushed a faint and lovely pink  --  she had the rare gift of looking really beautiful when angry  --  and gripped her hands tightly together on her lap . Her feeling for her motherin-lawswung always between reverence and exasperation , accordingas the selflessness of Grandmother 's autocracy or the autocracy of her selflessness was uppermost . " But Grandmother , " she said slowly and evenly , " our living in the country is quite out of the question . George has this job at the War Office . " " I know you dislike the country , dear , " said Lucilla , " but I think you should consider George and the children . Town life is always bad for children , and after all he has been through in the war George would have better health in good air . He could resign his War Office appointment . " 49it would n't be right . " Suddenly she looked no longer firm , but pathetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nicely , dear . Jill is to come over with the Bread and go back with the Meat . Our tradesmen are always so kind and obliging . That 's one of the good things the war has done  --  made us all more friendly together . I 'd arranged it all so nicely . " Nadine yielded . " That 's all right , Grandmother , " she said gently . " I 'll see Jill here . It was sweet of you to arrange that for me . " Lucilla 's lovely blue eyes were alight with love as she smiled upon her obedient daughter-in-law . That horrid tight feeling that came about her heart when people opposed her eased a little . It was a nasty feeling , and people would never oppose her if they knew how nasty it was . " If we 've finished I 'll clear , " said Margaret . " I 'll help you wash up , " said Nadine , with that too-bright willingness of the guest who is weary of domesticity and hopes to goodness her noble offer will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Margaret , making the answer that had now become codified in the Eliot family . " Not your first evening . Tomorrow you shall help me . " " Hilary , " said Lucilla , " help Margaret lift the trolley over the rucks in the rugs that you made when you brought it in . " " Yes , Mother , " said Hilary . A bell rang . " That 's Jill , " said Lucilla . " I have arranged , Nadine , that you shall see her in the dining room . " " Yes , Grandmother , " said Nadine. 3The Damerosehay dining room , in spite of its beautiful paneling , lacked the charm of the drawing room , and was detested by all the Eliots except Lucilla , Hilary , and Margaret . It was a chill yet stuffy room , and after one had eaten fish or onions in it one knew that one had for a very long time afterwards . It had been Ellen 's special pride , and because she had loved it so much Lucilla would not let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellen had made it , a shrine of Victorian respectability .

And you know , dear , you would have quite a nice little income to augment . You would have George 's pension , and your legacy from your aunt Anne . You did not tell me that your aunt had died , dear  --  andafter all , why should you , for she was unknown to me  --  but I saw the announcement in the Times , and I saw her will , too , inthe Times . " " There 's not as much as you 'd think , Grandmother . Not withincome tax . " " Income tax , " murmured Lucilla meditatively , " comes invery useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to do but do n't want to do they always plead income tax . The war flour is useful , too . When cakes do n't rise there 's a scapegoat handy . " And she secretly gave the Bastardthe last bit of her bun . No one 's feelings were hurt . There were times nowadayswhen Lucilla uttered aloud the sentiments that she thought shewas only thinking . This was obviously one of those times . " Yes , dear , " she said more loudly , with intention to be heard , " I 've arranged about your interview with Jill . She 's coming tosee you this evening . " " But Grandmother , " pleaded Nadine , " I had thought I would go and see her . W hen one is interviewing anyone as importantas a nanny it is rather nice to see the sort of home they have . " " It is n't her home , dear ; it 's her aunt 's . " " I know , but she 's been there for some time and it 's her presentsetting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It 's too far for you to walk , dear , and the village taxi hasbroken down . " " I know , Grandmother , but I thought Hilary would be sokind as to take me . " " Certainly , " said Hilary cheerfully . " No , dear , " said Lucilla firmly . " We ca n't take Hilary awayfrom his parish duties and use him as a taxi two days running ; 50pet , heavy silver upon the sideboard . A massive portrait of Grandfather in his legal wig and robes hung over the mantelpieceand his heavy kindly face looked out with approval over the room that Ellen had created to his memory . Ellen had deeply respected Sir James Eliot , and it was largely owing to her that Lucilla , who had not loved him in the early days of their marriage , nor the children that she had borne him either , had become in the end a pattern wife and mother and had created that tradition of faithfulness in an accepted task , faithfulnessat whatever cost , which was now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story of Lucilla 's youth and indeed it had been her story more than anything else that had reunited her to George . The influence of Ellen , maid and nanny to the Eliots for a lifetime , had been , and was , deep and strong even to the third generation , and it struck Nadine almost like a blow in the face , when she entered the detested dining room , to see Jill standing there almost like another Ellen , straight and stiff beneath the portrait of her father-in-law , looking an integral part of the room . She felt suddenly caught . When , compelled by the Damerosehaytradition , she had broken with the man she loved and come back again to her unloved husband , it had been with a scarcely recognized inner reservation . While David , who loved her and whom she so desperately loved , was alive and free in the world , still loving and desiring her , the door was not shut . If it did not work with George , if it once more became utterly impossible , David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself in so many words , but the thought of that secret stair of escape was always with her . It was the rock to which she clung when it seemed as though her unhappiness would overwhelm her . And now , looking at Jill , it was as though the door to the stair , always ajar , began to close a little . For this was a woman withoutreservations . Jill made her afraid even as Hilary made her afraid . From Hilary 's challenge she could escape , because she saw so little of him , but from Jill 's she would not be able to escape . They would be together always , mother and nanny , even as Lucilla and Ellen had been together always , with Jill 's singlemindednessa perpetual danger to her own lack of it . She paused52for a moment , not knowing what to say , at a loss for perhaps the first time in her self-possessed life . It was Jill who spoke first . " Good afternoon , madam , " said Jill . Her voice was timid and soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ridiculousfeeling of panic and was herself again , a beautiful , welldressed , self-possessed woman of the world interviewing a rather scared , dowdy little country woman who had applied to her for the post of nanny to her children .. . . Jill , after all , was not in the least like Ellen . It had been just a fancy of hers . " Good afternoon , Jill , " said Nadine , shaking hands graciously . " It 's nice to see you again . Do sit down . " " Thank you , madam , " whispered Jill , and perched herself stiff as a ramrod upon the extreme edge of one of the hard dining-room chairs . Nadine sat upon another and found that she also had to hold herself stiff as a ramrod . She had forgotten how uncomfortable they were . She was sure they had been chosen originally by Grandfather Eliot to teach deportment to the Eliot young . Sighing , and fitting her back as comfortably as she could against the panel of wood behind her , she resigned herself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , and studied Jill . Jill was twenty-four years old now , but in spite of marriage and widowhood she still looked like the nursemaid Nadine had briefly known in the Damerosehay nursery before the war . She was thin and undersized , with a plain pale face redeemed by very beautiful eyes of a clear shade of green , the green that is seen in the curve of a wave upon a shadowed day . Her mouth was tender and her chin was strong . In her neat gray flannel coat and skirt and white blouse she looked already the nanny she aspired to be . She wore no hat , and her tow-colored , lusterlessstraight hair was arranged in a neat roll round her beautifullyshaped little head . She kept her ungloved hands very still in her lap . There was nothing about her to challenge attention , and for a brief moment Nadine marveled that any man had noticed her enough to marry her . Then she noticed again the tenderness of the mouth and the tranquillity of the hands . She opened her mouth to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . All she said was , " Jill , you will love my children . " " Yes , madam , " said Jill simply . " And help me to do my best for them . " " Yes , madam . " Desperately Nadine groped after the questions she had prepared , but succeeded in capturing only one of them . " Lady Eliot is afraid you will not be willing to live in London ? " " I 'll be perfectly willing , madam . I did tell Lady Eliot , when she asked me , that I liked the country best , but of course wherever the children are I will make myself contented . " Nadine smiled suddenly , aware that Lucilla stood corrected , not of lying , for Lucilla never did , but of a slight exaggeration to gain her purpose . " I 'm glad you feel like that , Jill , " she said . " You see , General Eliot has an appointment at the War Office , and we have a very nice little house at Chelsea and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall like Chelsea , madam , " said Jill . " There is the river and the gulls  --  like there is at the Hard . " " You love the Hard ? " asked Nadine . " Yes , madam . I 'm sorry my Auntie Rose is selling the Herb of Grace . " " Is she ? I did not know that . " " Yes , madam . She lost my uncle a little while back . It was to help her over his illness and the funeral and all that I left the day nursery where I was working . She do n't feel she can keep on the inn alone . She 's going to live with Edith , her daughter in law . You know the I lerb of Grace , madam ? " " I do n't think I do , Jill . I know the little hotel at the Hard , of course , but it 's not the one , is it ? " " No , madam , it 's further on down the river . It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't get much custom . It did n't pay through the war . " " I should think it would now that the war is over . People will be sailing again . There will be lots of white wings again on the Estuary and the river . " " Yes , madam , but Auntie do n't seem to feel she can tackle it . " " Yes , I understand . It 's the war . None of us feel we can tackle54anything . I do n't feel I can tackle my children . When can you come to me , Jill ? " " Well , madam , I 'd like to get Auntie Rose settled with Edith before I leave her . In another month ? " Another month ! Nadine 's heart sank . She had been hoping for next week . Another month ! But doubtless Auntie Rose 's need was just as great as hers . " A month from today , " she said , firmly clinching it . " I 'll write to you from London , Jill , and tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea ? " " I 'll have one when I get home , madam , if you 'll excuse me . I do n't want to keep the butcher waiting . " " No , of course not , " said Nadine , levering herself forward from her Egyptian position . Whatever one did or did not do , nowadays , one had to keep on the right side of the butcher or there 'd be no tidbits for the dogs . " I 'll try to give satisfaction , madam , " said Jill as they shook hands , and then she slipped unobtrusively away into the shadows , opening and closing the door so softly that Nadine was hardly aware that she had gone until she found herself alone . " I 'll try to give satisfaction . " It was years since Nadine had heard that old-fashioned remark . Because she had not heard it for so long it struck her as being rather a wonderful phrase . Satisfied . No one ever was . The whole world was crying out with hunger of some sort , physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . That was all one could do . She stood still for a moment , one hand over her eyes , desperatelyconscious of her own particular hunger . For rest . For peace . For David . Most of all for David , because it seemed to be only with him that she could find the other two . During the war it had been comparatively easy to put aside her love for David . There had been so much to do and bear , and one had been so keyed up to the doing and the bearing . Now , though there was still much to do and bear , one was n't keyed up any more ; the circle of acute consciousness had narrowed from one 's country to oneself again and the personal problems once more pressed intolerably . And David was no longer a flier , seldom accessible to his family and on his brief leaves seemingly withdrawnfrom them into another element ; he was back on the stage55again , back in London , back in his old place in the family , Lucilla 's favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same little house in Chelsea where she had lived before the war , during the time of her separation from George , and where they had first fallen in love with each other ; every time she saw him the longing for the love she had put from her grew more intolerable .... Suddenly she hated it all : Damerosehay , Lucilla , George , the children , her duty .. .. How idiotic it all was . Life was going by so quickly and she had never yet done a thing she wanted to do . " Nadine ! " It was Lucilla 's voice calling her , and automatically she obeyedand went out to the hall . Lucilla was sitting on the chair beside the telephone , holding the receiver in her hand . " It 's someone ringing up , dear . But I really ca n't hear . I 'm so deaf , you know . I 'm no good at thetelephone . " Her voice was full of distress . She hated these modern inventions , telephone , and radio ; they did nothing but make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without . She pleaded her deafness as exemption from participation in these benefits of science , but her family noticed that her deafnessonly seemed to trouble her when it was a question of answeringthe telephone or turning on the news . " No one 's ill , are they , dear ? " she asked anxiously , as Nadinetook the receiver . " No , I do n't think so .... Why , it 's George .... Hullo , oldboy .... You all right ? Children all right ? You 've only just got Grandmother 's letter ? What letter ? What did you say ? You canget off for a few days and come down with the children ? " " I think , dear , that this call is really for me , " said Lucillagently , and courteously but firmly she removed the receiver from Nadine . " It 's Mother , George , " she said , and thereafterthere was silence while she listened to George . Her deafness did not seem to be troubling her just at the moment . " Yes , dear , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring the children . A little holiday will do you good and it will be nice for Nadine to have you here , too . You can manage a week ? That 's good . Dear boy , I 'm so glad . " Then still holding the receiver she56turned to Nadine , a smile of sheer happiness irradiating her face like sunshine . " I wrote a little note to George , dear , after you had said over the phone that he would not be able to come down with you . I said to try his hardest and to bring the children . I thought a little holiday would do you all such good . It seems he 's only just got my letter . It was delayed in the post . But it 's all right , dear , they 're coming  --  twins and all . George will drive them down tomorrow morning . " Lucilla 's joy was so lovely a thing to see that Nadine could say nothing to quench it , but she found it difficult to force an answering smile , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd be here by lunchtime tomorrow and her period of peace was not going to last very long . Also George had said something that she did not quite understand . " Only just got Mother 's letter . Tell her I 'd like to have a look at the oldplace . " He might , of course , have been referring to Damerosehay , but she had a feeling that he was not . What old place had Lucilla suggested he should have a look at ? She bent over and very gently took the receiver from Lucilla 's hand , even as Lucillahad taken it from hers . " You still there , George ? Yes ? Darling , bring my slacks down with you , will you ? If we 're staying a week I 'd like my slacks . And a couple of shirts too . The blue one and the yellow one . Pamela will see about the children 's clothes . Good-by , darling . Do n't forget the slacks . " And she hung up the receiver . Lucilla hated slacks , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them at Damerosehay . But now she was just going to. 4All her life Lucilla had changed her dress twice in the day , once for tea and once again in the evening , and she still did so , even though what she still insisted upon calling dinner was now no more than Bengers for herself , bread and cheese for Margaret , and whatever else they could scrape up when visitors came . Until the war she had requested that the rest of the family dress too , but now she could no longer insist upon that ; they said they had nothing to change into , and in any case , what was57the point of changing when as soon as a meal was over you had to put on an overall and wash up ? Lucilla alone , in the black lace dress she had had for fifteen years , bridged the gap between the gracious manners of the past and what she hoped would be the gracious manners of the future . For Lucilla was not without hope for the future . She had lived long enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that if it was to be a flowering spring one must make one 's preparations . She was making hers . She herself , she knew , would not see this spring , but her grandchildren and perhaps her children would , and it was for them that she prepared . She sensed in her children , and in David , her grown-up grandson , and in his contemporaries a deep and desperate fatigue . They seemed to her to be just standing about in the rubble and looking at it despairingly , not knowing what to do about it . They knew they ought to set about rebuilding but they seemed too tired to make a start . They lacked initiative . When they could they had gone straight back to their prewar jobs , as David had done , or to their old neighborhood , as Nadine had gone back to that little house in Chelsea , automatically seeking the old grooves as a strayed cat automatically turns homeward . But though they were back in the old grooves they were back there without the old ardor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone out . What they needed , Lucilla considered , was either new homes and new jobs , or else the infusion of some fresh spirit into the old things that should transform them like water poured into wine . Everywhere , in everything , there must be a rebirth , and it was her business as head of the Eliot family to do what she could to make it anew before she died . It might have been argued that her own fatigue was as deep as that of any of her family , and that at her age she had earned the right to sit back and let them plan for her rather than she for them , but Lucilla did not see it that way . For one thing , she realized that the old are to a large extent spectators in the game , and standing a little aloof from the lives of their children allows them a clearer perspective than the livers of them can hope to get . And then humble as she was she could not help but be aware that the58experience of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her little fingers than into the whole of the rest of the family put together . And lastly , Lucilla liked managing . She was a born organizer , and tired though she was could no more refrain from organizing than a bird from singing . If in her rebuilding she should have to override the wills of others with her own she would do it without compunction , for in what she had planned there was no self-seeking . Lucilla made her plans during those two periods of the day , at two o'clock and again at six-thirty , when she went to her room , rested , and changed her dress . They were blessed periods , and without them she felt that she could scarcely have gone on living . Increasingly , as the years went by , her beautiful bedroomhad become for her a sort of sanctuary . There was a deep peace in it ; she did not quite know why , unless it was that for so many years it was here that she had prayed most deeply and most often , so often , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in her as automatically as it did when she crossed the threshold of Hilary 's church at Big Village . Having toiled up the stairs on this particular spring evening Lucilla entered her room , shut the door , and looked about her . In the old days Ellen would have been here , standing waiting for her by the window , one hand crossed over the other . Ellen would have helped her into her dressing gown , and then she , Lucilla , would have lain down on the sofa and watched Ellen get out her black lace dress from the wardrobe , shake out its folds , and then take the appropriate petticoat , shoes , and handkerchieffrom their appointed places . All this Ellen would have done with the solemnity of a religious rite , and then she would have brushed Lucilla 's hair with the silver-backed hairbrushes ; while she brushed they would have talked about the children and the grandchildren and the dogs , about the delinquencies of the maids ( if they happened to have any ) or the daily help ( if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger generation behaved , and whatever the world could possibly be coming to . Easy talk , not appearing to go much below the surface of things , yet in reality going deep because the two women knew each other so well that with a lightly spoken sentence they could59reveal to one another almost the whole of their unspoken thoughts . Well , Ellen 's bodily presence was no longer here , and Lucilla missed it intolerably , yet as she moved about her room , doing for herself what Ellen used to do for her , she always found herself talking to Ellen , and her perplexities presently melted away as they had been wont to do when in the old days Ellen had applied to them the acid of her strong common sense . Today , following her usual program , Lucilla took off her dress , put on her soft gray dressing gown , and lay down on the sofa . She prayed a little , and then she placed upon her lap the big black velvet bag from which she was never separated , and which contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cologne , the silver box which in the old days had always containedsugared almonds for the delectation of the grandchildren , but which nowadays , when there were n't any sugared almonds or any grandchildren in permanent residence , contained merely Bisodol tablets for her indigestion , and the current letters from her family . She searched through the bag and took out her spectaclesand the last letter from her son George . " I am afraid , " she said , speaking to Ellen , " that I am perhapsnot being quite straight with Mrs. George . I am working behind her back . Yes , I am . And I hate it when people do that with me . Yet what can I do ? I have to think first of my son . " Lucilla 's chronic difficulty in realizing that her children were not only grown-up , but elderly , was further increased in the case of her son George by the fact that he never had fully grown up . Ile was a brilliant soldier , a fine mathematician , he had won nearly every honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profession , including the Victoria Cross , but yet there was a part of him that had never grown up . The part of his mind that he applied to the technicalities of his profession was keen and fine as tempered steel , but the part of it that he applied to religion , politics , and domesticity had not developed very much since his school days . I le was Church of England , a conservative , a faithful and loving husband , a kind and loving father . But his religion had never consisted in more than believing in God without having even asked himself what he meant by God , and in going to church to set a good example to6othe regiment or the children ; his politics were just a matter of believing that whatever those damned Labor fellows did was sure to be disastrous . His love for his wife was the unwavering worship of a good dog for his master , and his love for his childrenthe protective , infinitely careful affection of a good master for his dog ; in neither case was it very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , very loyal and very loving , and he was a brave , loyal , and loving man . His courage and loyalty had always been obvious , but not his love , because he had been an inarticulate little boy and he was an inarticulate man . Only Lucilla understood the power of his loving and the suffering it caused him in his life , and only she had ever been able to solve his personal problems for him because only she had succeeded in knowing about them without being told . As a little boy , he had come to her room , fair-haired , blueeyed , and ruddy ( he was one of the beautiful Eliots ) , and standing on one leg like a stork had thoughtfully wiped his nose on the back of his left hand . Then she had known there was something wrong . A little gentle probing on her part had revealed that he had bad toothache , had had it for days but had n't said anything , and was only now standing on one leg and wiping his nose on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a pitch that he really could not endure it any more . Nowadays , when he came to see her , it was much the same . He would stand beside her on the hearthrug in the drawing room with his back to the fire so that the warmth of it could not reach her ( a habit of all the Eliot men ) , shift his weight to his right leg , and thoughtfully rub his left ear . Then she would know that either the war was going worse than usual , that things were not as they should be between him and Nadine , that he was anxious about one of the children , or that his warbatteredbody was really making it very difficult for him to keep his end up . Passing in a gentle flow of talk from one subject to another she would know which it was because when she reached the troubling one he would shift his weight from his right foot to his left and stop rubbing his ear . Then she would speak hopefully upon the subject , not able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her , and anyhow if it6rhad to do with tanks she lacked technical knowledge , but comfortinghim and clearing his mind by the mere fact that her love was taking the trouble to try to understand .. . . He loved her very much , as did all her children and her grandchildren . It was easier to help him when he wrote a letter , not that he was a good letter writer , for he was not , but because he had at least got to say something when he took a pen in his hand , while when he stood by her on the hearthrug there was no necessity . She unfolded the letter she had taken from her bag and read it again attentively . Dear Mother , Hope you and Margaret are well . How 's the rheumatism ? Better , I hope . Though I do n't see how it can be in this weather . A lot of fog in town . Seems to get into one 's lungs . Filthy stuff , Town fog . Seems some while since I wrote . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you once a week . Do you remember ? And you still write to me once a week , and do n't you dare leave off , for I look for those letters . Have done , all my life . I 'm a rotten correspondent . Dead beat by the end of the day . Have n't been feeling too fit lately . Nothingto worry about but I 'm not as young as I was . Looking forward to the day when they put me out to grass . Never had much liking for office life , nor Town life either . No good at it . But Nadine likes it , so must keep on for the present . She 's well , though very tired . She 's very keen on this house . Of course it 's more home to her than it is to me , because she lived here when I was in India , and through part of the war too , when I was hardly ever home . She 's been repaintingit all , working out fresh color schemes , rearranging the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can see it 's artistic . David got the paint for her and brought along some of his fellows from the theater to help . They did most of the work in fact . We see a certain amount of David . Nadine likes him and they have a lot of friends in common , writers and so on , all far too highbrow for me . The children are all right but the house seems a bit full of them in the holidays , especially the twins . They need a garden . How 's the Damerosehay garden ? I 'd like to run down and take a look at it sometime , and perhaps sail a hit and have a spot of fishing . I 've a bit of leave owing . What the boys and I like about this house is that the river 's handy . Ca n't sail on it , of course , or fish in it , but you can smell it . Simply must get out of Town in the summer holidays . I 'd like to take the boys sailing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or anyone for that matter . And Ben has a bit of a cough . Nadine says it 's nothing , but I do n't like it . Put up at some riverside inn somewhere . Always had a liking for riverside inns . So have the boys . They 're mad on boats . They get that from me . Well , good-by , Mother . Take care of yourself . Love to Margaret . Your loving son , GEORGEIt was the longest and most revealing letter George had ever written to her , and the only one , so far as she could remember , that had ever contained even a hint of personal complaint . She read it again . He was feeling very tired , very ill . He was longingto leave the army . He hated London , and Nadine 's artistic house , where she had lived so long without him that it seemed to him her home but not his , with no place in it for him . And he did not approve of London for the children . And he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... He had never got on with David . He did not know , of course , that when Nadine had left him and come home to England , leaving him alone in India , she had fallen in love with David , and he with her , and had only been waiting for the divorce which George had promised her , to get married . Lucilla had succeeded in stopping the marriage , in reuniting Nadine and George , and had agreed with Nadine that George should never be told . That desperate , abortive love had remained , and always would remain , a secret between Nadine , Lucilla , Hilary , and David . But George must sense something . He obviously did not like David and Nadine being so much together .... Nor did Lucilla . . . . She did not know whether or not they were still in love , but even if they were not it was playing with fire to be together so much . Upon her very first reading of the letter Lucilla had known what she had to do .... Make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the whole family to the country .... The only difficulty was , where in the world to find a house for them ? And then she had seen Nadine 's advertisement for a nanny , and had gone over to see Jill at the Herb of Grace and discovered that the old riverside inn would soon be for sale ... . George and the boys loved boats and the water .. .. It was a beautiful old house and could easily be made into a very lovely63home . It was old-fashioned , of course , but then refrigerators and bathrooms and things were all quite modern fads , and in Lucilla 's young days they had all got along quite nicely withoutthem . " Give me your word , " she had said to Auntie Rose , " that you will not sell the house to anyone else until my son General Eliot has seen it . " And Auntie Rose had given her word . And then Nadine had rung up asking to come and stay , and she had begged that George should come too , but Nadine had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment , had made Lucilla see red . She was a good and affectionate mother-in-law , provided the women her sons had taken to wife did not attempt to manage them .... That was her prerogative . ... Still seeing red , she had written that letter to George imploringhim to take a little holiday and come down with the children . She had not seen the children for so long , she had said . She might not live much longer ( this , though perhaps an unfair argument , was an irresistible one , she had discovered ) . As an apparent afterthought , at the end of the letter she had mentioned casually that the Herb of Grace , an old inn on the river near the Hard , was for sale . She was not sure that George had ever seen it , and it was of great historic interest . Yet perhaps she ought not to have gone behind Nadine 's back like that . It was not really right to do evil that good might come , though so often , in dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellen would have had no compunction about it . Ellen would have said that at all costs Mr. George and the children must have their country home , and Mrs. George be separated from Master David and that house in Chelsea that reminded her at every turn of the days when she had been going to marry him . She could hear Ellen 's voice saying it . She lay back and rested for a little while , continuing her plans for ensuring that George and the children saw the Herb of Grace before Nadine did , and lost their hearts to it so completelythat Nadine , in complete ignorance of its lack of modern conveniences , would not be able to refuse them their hearts ' 64desire . That should be easy . She had begun all right by seeing to it that Nadine interviewed Jill here and not there . She dozed off for a moment or two , and then she got up and began the slow , laborious , painful business of washing her hands , changing into her black lace dress , and arranging her beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of diamondsthat protected her wedding ring , her emerald ring upon the other hand , her lorgnette upon a thin gold chain , and the little gold wrist watch that David had given her , she always wore , but she added a few extra touches tonight because Nadine was here . She put on her best , very ancient , satin petticoat , the one that rustled with that lovely rustle that no modern garment seemed able to achieve . She took out her loveliest lace handkerchief and scented it with eau de cologne , powdered her nose very carefully , and put a little posy of flowers into her waistband . The gong went just as she had finished her preparations , and she crossed slowly to the door , enjoying the rustle . The Bastard was waiting for her on the mat outside and followed her stately progress down the stairs , wheezing heavily and with great importance . Pooh-Bah was waiting for her on the mat at the foot of the stairs , and both dogs fell into line and paced behind her to the drawing-room door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for her in the drawing room , and to please her they had made a little effort . Nadine had knotted a light gauzy scarf about the shoulders of her black dress and looked superb , Margaret had changed her yellow jumper for a pink one and put on her pearls . The fact that she had not changed from her gardening shoes to her slippers was , Lucilla knew , a mere oversight , and she did not mention it . " Is dinner ready ? " she asked , smiling at them with loving approval . " Yes Mother , " said Margaret , and they passed in procession to the dining room . Nadine was very tired , and hysterical laughter rose suddenly within her as the three of them sat down to their Bengers and sardines . The massive silver on the table , the lighted candles and the flowers , the beautiful china , Grandmother 's toilet .... And Bengers and sardines .... Then she choked down her laugh-65ter . For Margaret had made a special effort tonight . She had grilled the sardines and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were so very withered that she had surely been hoarding them for a very long time as a special treat for an honored guest . And Grandmother , eating her Bengers very slowly so as to make it last out through the two courses her daughters were consuming , ate it with such an air that Nadine could almost see the ghost of the butler whom she had once had looming behind her chair , and looking down at her plate was suddenly astonished to see a sardine there instead of a wing of chicken . " They do say , " said Lucilla in her lovely musical old voice , " that now the mines have been swept away the fishing fleets will be able to get out again and we 'll have plenty of real fish . It would be nice , would n't it , to taste a Dover sole again ? " " You 're right , Grandmother , " said Nadine warmly , and with what Margaret thought unnecessary depth of conviction . But Lucilla knew , from the warm current of sympathy suddenly set flowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only to Dover soles . She was apologizing for that stifled mirth that had not gone unobserved by Lucilla , and she was saying that she recognized Lucilla 's efforts at preservation as what they were , not so much the salvage of useless trash from a lost past , but paving stones set upon the quagmire of these times , leading to a new dignity whose shape she could not guess at yet. 66Chapter IVNADINE slept that night as she had not slept for weeks . That was a gift that Damerosehay usually seemed able to give  --  sleep . That timelessness of the place loosened one 's hold upon the cares of today and the silence took them and hid them . Nadine 's small single room faced over the marshes to the Estuary , and after she had undressed she stood at the window watching the lights of cottages twinkling out on the marsh and the light of a great ship passing beyond in the darkness . Then she got into bed and lay for a little listening to the soft rustling of the reeds . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the half-dark and heard that muted orchestra of strange cries with which the sea birds welcomed the dawn . Then there was silence again , and she slept once more until she woke in a blaze of sunshine and found Margaret in a blue overall setting a breakfast tray beside her bed . " Mother has hers in bed nowadays , " said Margaret , " and I thought you 'd better too . It 'll rest you . George and the children will be here by lunch . " Their eyes met and they laughed . " And do n't you need rest before the invasion , Margaret ? " asked Nadine . " I 'm strong , you know , " said Margaret . " It 's a good thing , " she added as a plain statement of fact , with no sarcasm . " I 'm afraid it 's only just toast and marmalade and coffee . I 'm keeping the bacon and eggs for George and the children for lunch . Is raisin tart still the twins ' favorite pudding ? I 've one bottle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Nadine . " It 's extraordinary what children can digest . " " I 'll do a milk pudding too , " consoled Margaret . " Now do n't 67get up till you feel inclined . Have a good rest . My daily is coming up from the village this morning and she 'll get the bedroomsready . Have I forgotten anything on the tray ? " Nadine could see she had forgotten several things , including the marmalade spoon and the teaspoon , but she forbore to mention it , for where would they all be without Margaret ? " Has it made you happy , Margaret ? " she asked . " What ? " asked Margaret . " Slaving for the Eliot family . " " I 'm happy , " said Margaret . " Are n't you ? " " No , " said Nadine , pouring out her coffee . They looked at each other , separated by that intangible barrier of a whole world of experience that lies between a beautiful woman who has married and borne children and possessed every blessing that the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . " What is it that you have n't got , Nadine ? " asked Margaret bluntly . " Some saving grace , " said Nadine . " Something that you have and I have not . Some sort of astringency . I do n't know what it is .... You do make good coffee , Margaret . " Margaret flushed with pleasure and went away , and Nadine helped herself to marmalade with the blade of her knife and stirred her coffee with the handle and ruminated dreamily in the warm spring sunshine . An astringent grace . Not one of the flowing graces . Astringent , like an herb . Ilcrb of Grace . Why , that was the name of the inn . Jill 's inn . Jill 's herb . Oh , thank God for Jill ! I low wonderful it would be to have a nanny . She drank her coffee and ate her toast with glorious slowness , and had her bath and dressed in heavenly leisure . Her violets , that the children 's friend had sent her , were too faded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing astringent about violets , she thought ; and they were her favorite flower . That unknown girl had sent her a very suitable gift . She opened her door and went out into the passage . The room next to hers was the little room over the porch that David always used when he came here . She walked past the door , then turned back , opened it , and went in . Lucilla always kept this room exactly as David liked it , and never put anyone else to sleep here if she could68help it , so that it was always waiting for him . It was an austere little room , holding just a few treasures : some rare books , an exquisite Chinese model of a galloping horse in blue-green china , and a reproduction of Van Gogh 's painting of a lark tossing over a wind-blown cornfield . The galloping horse , the tossing lark , bathed now in early-morning sunshine , were the very incarnation of happy freedom . Nadine felt suddenly desperate . Freedom and happiness . And she and David had turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door ajar , and now , hearing a soft rustle behind her , she turned . Lucilla was standing in the doorway , her blue eyes full of pity and anxiety , but her sweet mouth very determined . But she uttered no reproach at finding Nadine on forbidden ground . " I 'm going out into the garden , dear , to stone the raisins for Tommy 's favorite cake . " " I 'll help you , " said Nadine . " I 'm putting Ben and Tommy in their usual room , " said Lu- cilia , as she slowly descended the stairs , Nadine following meekly after . " And would you mind , dear , if I had Caroline in my dressing room as I used to do when she was a little girl and lived with me ? " " Of course not , Grandmother , " said Nadine . " The twins shall sleep in the old nursery , George can have the blue room , and you shall stay where you are . A room to oneself is the best rest of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was married .... Does George snore , dear ? " " Yes , Grandmother . " " I guessed as much . He 's very like his father . Bring the garden chairs , dear . It 's so warm that I think we could sit under the ilex tree to do the raisins . " They sat together in the sweet spring sunshine with the dogs at their feet , the blackbirds singing over their heads , and the garden a blaze of glory before their eyes . Lucilla , chatting casually about this and that , was very sweet and loving to her daughter-in-law . But Nadine did not suppose that her trespass of the morning would be overlooked . Nor was it . " It was a great triumph to get these raisins , " said Lucilla . " I do so wish David would marry some nice girl . It would do 69him so much good . He has been through so much , poor boy , and a nice girl-wife to make him young again is what he needs . Do you like doing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you rather have this silver knife ? " Nadine 's heart missed a beat , but she kept her face expressionlessand her voice casual . " No , thank you , Grandmother . I belong to the finger and thumb school of thought . Have you anyone in mind ? " " No , dear . I see so few young people nowadays . I do n't even seem to see much of my dear David now ; he is so busy . You see him much more often than I do . Have you noticed him with any nice girls ? " " With hundreds , Grandmother , but I have n't noticed him falling for one more than another . " " It 's such a pity , " sighed Lucilla . " It 's as though something were holding him back . As though he needed to be set free in some way . " There was a little silence . " Set free ? " murmured Nadine . " Freedom and happiness are always on ahead , " said Lucilla . " Never behind . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never mind , we 'll soon pick them up again . What was I saying ? Oh , yes , David 's marriage . As you know , dear , the whole family decided that this house should be David 's at my death , partly because he loves it so , and partly because he is best able to keep it up as the family home for all of you . But I 've set my heart on his having it before my death . I want him to come here with his bride , and then Margaret and I can go and live at Big Village . " Nadine was speechless . Lucilla and Damerosehay were in her mind so inseparably one that she could not visualize Lucilla living anywhere else . " I 've planned it all , " said Lucilla . " You know that pretty little cottage near Ililary 's vicarage , Lavender Cottage , where Miss Marble lives ? Miss Marble is getting too old , now , to do for herself , and she wants to go and live with her niece at Bournemouth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I thought it would be nice for Margaret to have just a small place to look after , for she has worked much too hard for us all70in this great house . And Lavender Cottage has a lovely little garden for her . And then in my last illness she 'll have Hilary handy , only just across the road . And when I die she can either stay in the cottage or move across to Hilary , just as she fancies . " " But Grandmother , " gasped Nadine , " wo n't it break your heart to leave Damerosehay and all your treasures ? " " No , " said Lucilla . " It was for my children 's and my grandchildren'ssake  --  and especially for David 's sake  --  that I came to Damerosehay . For their sake I 've lived here happily and for their sake I 'll leave happily . I 'll take a few of my things with me to Lavender Cottage and the rest I 'll leave here for David and his wife . " " I only hope , Grandmother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden bitterness , " that this wife of David 's will appreciate Damerosehay and its treasures . You know , it 's all a bit out of date . " It was a cruel thing to say , and the moment she had said it Nadine could have bitten her tongue out . She dared not look at Lucilla 's face , but she saw her brace her shoulders and saw her fingers fumbling over the raisins . It was a comfort to have Margaret appear at this moment with the eleven o'clock cups of tea . When she went away again they talked of other things until the raisins were done , after which they went indoors to wash their hands and Nadine went up to her room. 2She stayed there writing letters until the sound of a car 's wheels crunching on the drive and then a wild commotion of barking dogs and shouting children told her that her family had arrived ; even then she lingered a little that Lucilla might have the joy of welcoming them without her ; that much reparationfor her cruelty she could make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downstairs . They were all with Lucilla and the dogs under the ilex tree : George , Ben , Tommy , Caroline , the twins , Jeremy and Josephine , and Mary the Pekinese , and they were all , George included , behaving as though this were the first day of the holidays and they were just home from school , with Lucilla the center of their joy .. . . And Lucilla looked utterly , radiantly happy ... 71But not too happy to see Nadine approaching and to yield to her instantly the place that was hers by right . " Look ! There 's Mother ! " said Lucilla , and put a twin off her knee and turned aside to pick up a fallen ball of wool . And Nadine , after twenty-four hours ' rest from her family , looked upon them with a sudden warming of the cockles of her heart as they surged about her . She put her hands on George 's shoulders and raised her face for his kiss with sudden pride in him . He was a good-looking man . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron-gray hair was still thick , with a crisp wave in it . Though his face was tired and lined there was no slackness about it , and his eyes as they smiled down at her were infinitely patient and kind . He was a good man , and she remembered that it was for his solid worth that she had originally married him , and not for the sensitiveness and intuitionthat she now so unreasonably demanded of him because she loved them in David . And Ben had them . Turning to her eldest son , seeing his sudden smile flash out like light over his thin dark face , she noticed for the first time the likeness to David that Sally had realized almost at the first glance , and for the first time it occurred to her that she might in the future find great comfort in her eldest son . And then the violence of one of Tommy 's bear hugs envelopedher and she forgot Ben . For Tommy was her favorite child . She adored his beauty , his vitality , and the love of adventurethat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was to her a restful quality , making it impossible for her to hurt him , as she so often hurt Ben and Caroline . And the simplicity of his self-seeking , not tangled up , as was hers , with a hampering sense of duty , also rested her . You knew where you were with Tommy . He meant what he said and did what he wanted to do and hid from you nothing whatever of his likes , dislikes , and distresses . Not that he had many of the latter . His health was of the rudest , and nothing except the thwarting of his will had any power to put him out . " Mother ? " whispered Caroline , and Nadine put Tommy forcibly from her and turned to kiss her plain , precise , anxious little daughter . How she had come to have such a child she never could imagine . Caroline was n't like her , and she was n't , in72looks , like George . She was n't like anybody in the family . She was a mixture of Queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nadine could never manage to feel for her anything more than the natural affection of a mother . Though she found her very useful . Her conscientiousness and motherliness made her invaluable in caring for the twins . The twins ! She felt tired again at the very sight of them , though a glow of maternal pride went through her as she looked . They were taking no notice of her . Jerry had climbed up into the ilex tree , where he was greening the seat of his new turquoise-bluepants and making the most earsplitting noises . Jose , set down from her grandmother 's knee , had betaken herself to the iris bed with Mary in her arms . " Jerry , " said George , " come down out of that tree and kiss your mother . " " I ca n't , " said Jerry . " I 'm an air-raid siren . " " Do as I tell you , Jerry , " thundered George , who expected military obedience from his children but seldom got it from his youngest . Jerry 's only reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear , " said Lucilla gently , " that you had better sound the all clear and come down . There 's raisin tart for lunch . " Jerry shrieked wildly upon one note and fell from the tree , hooking his white shirt on a branch and ripping it from top to bottom . Arrived upon the ground he did not kiss his mother but made a beeline for the dining room . " Jose ! " commanded the thwarted George . " Kiss your mother . " Jose raised her lovely little flower-like face above the spikes of the iris leaves and smiled at him tolerantly . " Just a minute , " she said . " Mary , stay there . You 're Moses . Lie down , Mary . Lie down . Mother , you 're Pharaoh 's daughter . Come and find Moses . " Nadine found Moses and was kissed . Jose was on the whole an easier child than Jerry . If you did what she wanted then she would do what you wanted , whereas Jerry , like Tommy , regarded the attainment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hungry and the food was good the luncheon73 hour was irradiated by the harmony that comes when every- body is doing what he wants to do . Lucilla waited until the children and George were well into their second helpings of pudding before making her next move for their good . " I think Nadine looks rested already , do n't you , George ? " she inquired . George wiped his mustache with his napkin and considered his wife , the kind lines crinkling round his eyes . " Breakfast in bed ? " he inquired . " Margaret always spoils me , " said Nadine . " I think , dear , that a rest on your bed would be nice for you this afternoon , " said Lucilla . "   rest too , and Margaret has a meeting , I believe . George will look after the children , wo n't you , George ? You might run them over in the car to the Hard , dear , and look at the old inn I told you about , the Herb of Grace . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it has great historic interest . " " Will tomorrow do as well ? " inquired George , who had been driving all the morning and was tired . " Looks as though it might turn to rain this afternoon . " " Oh , no , dear , the glass is quite high still , though rain is foretold for tomorrow . The children would enjoy it , I think . There 's not only the inn for them to see but dear Jill , who was so good to Ben and Tommy and Caroline when they were little . And then there 's the river ... . " At this there was a whoop from Tommy , and Ben 's face kin died with delight . " Very well , Mother , " said George . " I rather think I 'll come too , " said Nadine . " I should like to see Jill again . There are a few things I forgot to say . " " You could write her a little note , dear , " said Lucilla . " And George will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really does need the rest very badly . " " By all means , " said George . " I 'll take the elder children and any number of notes , but I do jib at taking the twins . They get underfoot in the car to an astonishing degree . Could n't they play in the garden ? " " They could , dear , " said Lucilla , " but I think it would be 74 paying a pretty attention to Jill to take them to see her , since she is to be their nanny . " " Put her off entirely , I should think . Better keep ' em out of sight till she 's committed to it . " " Oh , no , dear . Jill will love to see dear Jose and dear Jerry . " Lucilla 's hand trembled a little as she helped herself to toast . The way in which modern parents discussed their offspring in front of them chilled her to the bone , especially if the remarks were of a type to make the darlings think they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken their father 's remarks to heart . They were completely absorbed , Jerry in raisin tart , and Jose in spilling lemonade down her blue smock with what appeared to be deliberate intention . " I 'll take them , " said George resignedly . " You have a good rest , Nadine . I 'll manage . " Nadine did not fight it . The memory of the cruel thing she had said was with her still . She did not know why Lucilla was so bent upon keeping her from seeing the Herb of Grace , but it was not in her to hurt Lucilla any more that day . X31The twins had not taken their father 's remarks to heart for the very good reason that they never paid the slightest attention to anything that he said . They never paid any attention to anythinganybody said . Separated by a considerable gap of years from Ben , Tommy , and Caroline , they lived together in the bright world of their own imaginings as though inside a rainbowsoap bubble , and had only a casual glance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindly disposed towards the people and things outside , but nothing and nobody was very real to them until he , she , or it had been drawn inside their bubble and metamorphized by their imaginations into something that though the same was different , like the beast in " Beauty and the Beast " when he became a handsome prince . When they were drawing someone into their bubble in this way , as a spider draws a fly into his web , they would become suddenly most endearing , as though a little sugar were necessary for the enticing of the victim . And then the latter would think himself popular with the twins . .. . But he would be entirely mistaken . . . . All75the affection of which the twins were as yet capable was given only to each other . But though they never listened to anything he said they liked their father . Of all the people outside the bubble he was the one to whom they were most kindly disposed . Not only was his bulk useful to them , as being easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a gasoline pump , but it gave them a feeling of safety . He was the rock from whence they were hewn , and when some wind of the outside world caused the walls of their bubble to shiver and quake , presaging that dread day when the bubble would cave in altogether and stark reality be forever with them , they would seek shelter beside George like chickens beneath their mother 's wing . They did not feel this way about Nadine . To them she was still no more than that which she had been from the beginning , the source of nourishment . It was only at mealtimes that she was important . George unconsciously resented this on Nadine 's behalf and was always trying to make them pay a more courteous attention to their mother . But it was no good . The twins were at all times entirelyallergic to good influences . A good influence is no good at all as a protagonist in an imaginative drama . " I 'm going to sit by Daddy ! " yelled Jerry , as he came tearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had replaced the ruin of the blue knickers and white shirt of the morning . The car , seen beyond the open front door , had become for him in the moment of descent down the stairs a goods train . Father was the driver , himself the stoker , Jose the coal , and Ben and Tommy and Caroline the goods . " Me too ! " yelled Jose , knowing without being told that she was now coal , and making the kind of noise that coal does make falling down a chute . She also , now , was arrayed in sunshine yellow . She had spilled lemonade on the blue smock with deliberateintention . If Jerry made a mess of himself she always made a mess of herself too , because she could not endure to be dressed in colors different from what her twin was wearing . " Young toads ! You sat by Daddy coming down , " said Tommy bitterly , he having earmarked this post of honor for himself , because by watching George he was teaching himself to drive the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his76lovely living smile but the deprecating shadowy smile with which he confronted life 's minor disappointments .... One can see the country so much better from the front . Caroline said nothing , but slipped her hand into her father 's . She wanted to sit by him because she loved him more than anyone in the world . George pressed her hand and dropped a kiss on the top of her head . Her devotion touched him very deeply , and because of it she was his favorite child .... Though he would have been considerably astonished had he known that her love for him was less that of a daughter for her father than of a mother for her child .... Lucilla , sitting on the hall seat with Nadine to see them off , and watching the little drama , was well content . Caroline was unlikely to marry , too plain , poor child ; she would stay with George always and be the prop of his declining years . Lucilla felt that she could die happy , leavingGeorge in Caroline 's capable hands . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being his particular name for his eldest daughter . But at this the twins exploded into such a passion of grief and rage that the old house all but rocked with it . " Stop that noise at once ! " shouted George , unheard above the din . Nadine put her hands over her ears and hoped to goodness Jill would know what to do about these awful passions of the twins ; they were simply getting on her nerves . " In royal procession , " said Lucilla , who understood her grandchildren better than anyone , " the king and queen always sit in the back of the car with outriders to either side . Tommy and Ben would make splendid outriders . Sit to the left of them , Ben , and you 'll be the first to see the pond where the red and white water lilies grow , and then the turning to the Hard , and the river . Tommy , those woods to the right , opposite the pond , are still full of the shell cases they hid there in the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just like bones , rows and rows of vertebrae . You 're so fond of bones , dear . Caroline , my darling , give me a kiss before you go . " Somehow , in spite of the noise , her gentle voice reached the ears of all five of her grandchildren . The twins ' yells ceased as though a tap had been turned off , and in no time at all the family had settled themselves in the car in the positions she had indi-77cated .... Nadine dropped her hands thankfully to her lap , then picked up Mary , her Pekinese , and went upstairs to rest . Lying on her bed , with Mary stretched sweetly upon her chest , she fondled the little dog 's silky ears and thought how much easier dogs were than children , and wondered how on earth Lucilla did it , and if she 'd be any more efficient as a grandmother than she was as a mother , until she fell asleep . Chapter VEORGE , as the car slid down the drive through theoak wood , felt suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him night and day like toothache , the state of the world , his inability to be to his adored wife the husband that she wanted , and the unsatisfactory state of his own health that made him fear he might die and leave her to grapple singlehanded with all these children , found ease . The beauty of the spring flowers growing in the grass beneath the old oak trees , the scent of the gorse blowing in from the marshes , the warm sun , the sea wind , these things were not affected by the state of the world . Though apparently so fragile , their quality was more durable than the quality of anything that man could make , and encompassed by them George felt that he too would last out , at least until the children were well launched in life , if he could live always in this country air . The children ! The success of his paternity was very obvious to him at this moment , and comforted him for his failure as a husband . Here was his funny little Elf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hers whenever he looked her way , that smile that always made his protectiveness swell like a balloon inside his chest , and his two fine sons behind , still disgruntled because they had not been able to sit next to him . And the twins ! Though their roars had ceased there was still a backwash of sobs from them ( not grief-stricken now , merely automatic ) , and all because they had not been allowed to sit next to their father . George squared his shoulders as they swung into the road and hummed " Onward , Christian Soldiers " through his teeth , as was his habit when happy . The twins bowed to right and left with shattering dignity . Caroline kept an eye on her father 's driving , for she did not really consider him safe with a car if7978she were not there to look after him , and was always careful to warn him of anything approaching round the corner . Tommy , who had decided to be a surgeon when he reached man 's estate , was occupying himself making a sketch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time as they reached the shell cases in the wood . Only Ben was aware that this drive was not just another of the many drives they had with Father , but something that had a special significance . This was n't just a drive to see Jill and an old inn ; it was a drive to some important change in their lives . He did not know how this idea had come to him . Perhaps from Grandmother . Ever since the days when as small children he and Tommy and Caroline had lived at Damerosehay he and Grandmother had been very close to each other . . . . He often knew what she was thinking about .... This sense of expectation thrilled him , keyed him up , gave him that glorious feeling of being in the right relation to everything and everybody near him , so that the touch of the sun on his face , the pressure of Jose 's warm little body against his thigh were not just sensation , but a claiming of him that locked him into his place in the patternof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made his life a misery to him . Happy and excited he flung an arm round little Jose and smiled down at her . ... Outraged , Jose removed his arm , as though its presence about her were a sort of sacrilege , drew herself up stiff as a ramrod , and bowed to a rabbit scampering beneath the hedge . Beyond her , Jerry raised his hand to the salute as they passed a cow looking over a gate , and beyond Jerry , Tommy was gazing with knitted puzzled brows at the envelope held in his left hand , while with his right hand he violently prodded his chest as he tried to rememberexactly what happened at the junction of the stomach and the small intestine . . . . Ben decided , not for the first time , that all his family were quite mad , and turned his attention , as Grandmother had advised , to the view . It rewarded his observation , and in five minutes he had forgotten his family , the car , their destination , everything whateverexcept the ebb and flow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circling of clouds and birds ' wings , the flowinggreen curve of the meadows , and the deep-welling life8owithin him beating almost painfully against some closed door inside ; until the door yielded and he poured himself out , drawing again in exchange the color into his blood , the movementinto his muscles , the strength into his bones , and the quality of this spring world into his quality to be a part of him forever . When he got home again he would try to paint what he had seen , or write a poem about it , letting the color and movement and strength flow out of his blood and muscle and bone upon the paper . But he would not show his work to either his father or his mother .... He had learned not to .... For George , who wanted his eldest son to follow him into the army , would in spite of his astounded admiration for his son 's clevernessrub his ear and look ' worried , the fear that Ben was not developingaccording to plan showing only too clearly in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomatic service for Ben , would glance at the painting or poem with the same tolerant , amused inattentiveness that she bestowed upon the twins ' games , and he would feel , as usual , utterly and completely futile . He had sometimes shown his things to Grandmother , who did not understand art but understood Ben , and was incapable of a word or look that could wound him . And he very often showed them to David , whose intense interest was , he knew , unfeigned . David could not draw a line to save his life , but he knew all about drawing loveliness into your blood and bones and then pouring it out again , and between him and Ben would come that quick leaping up of sympathy that seemed to Ben a much closer brotherhood than the brotherhood of the flesh that linked him to Tommy . He would no more have dreamed of showing anything he had done to Tommy than to a boa constrictor . Though he got on well enough with Tommy . They were at one in their tolerant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , and for the rest they let each other alone and went their separate ways . There was no lovelier country in all the world than this , thought Ben , looking across the fields where the gulls were following the plow to the Island , which lay half hidden in rosy mist beyond the blue of the Estuary , its uplands just emerging from the mystery like the mountains in some Japa-81nese color print . Ben thought of the Island as a great brooding demon over the landscape . He always felt aware of the demon even when he could not see him , just as he was always aware , whether he saw it or not , of the old Cistercian abbey whose ruins were beyond the river and the Hard . .. . They had this countryside in their charge , these two patient presences .... Speeding past the plowed fields and the green meadows , and the little streams with their floating gardens of flowers , they passed the towering gray walls of a roofless , ruined chapel , and then the old and mighty barns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where once had been the monks ' ox farm and sheep farm , and that bore still the old names of the Bouvery and the Bargery . And then they were in the deep woods . The scent of the primroses and wood sorrel drifted to them , and George slowed down the car that they might feast their eyes upon the fresh spring green over their heads , and listen if they could hear a cuckoo calling , and watch for the flash of a jay 's wing or a sight of a squirrel 's cage high in a tall tree . Even Tommy ( until his attention was caught by the shell cases ) looked and listened , and the twins suddenly forgot the royal blood in their veins and were Rat and Mole in the woods . In London lately they had forgotten about Rat and Mole , but now they remembered the book that Grandmother had read to all her grandchildren in turn and that was now a classic in the Eliot family , and sudden ecstasy seized them . They did not need to tell each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much one for that , but as one child they brought their paws up over their snouts and began to make the most extraordinary noises . " Are those children going to be carsick ? " George asked Caroline . Caroline glanced anxiously back over her shoulder . " Scrape , scratch , scrabble , and scrooge , " said Jose . Caroline 's face cleared . " It 's all right , Daddy . They 're onlyplaying at The Wind in the Willows . " " Onion sauce ! Onion sauce ! " said Jerry . In their games he was Mole and Jose was Rat because shy had " a brown little face , a grave round little face , small neat ears , and thick silky hair . " Tommy was Toad because of his82boastful ways , and Ben was Badger because of his kindness to the younger brethren . " Mr. Badger , he 's a kindhearted gentleman , as everyone knows . " Caroline was the jailer 's daughter , " a pleasant wench and goodhearted . " Ben was watching eagerly now , as Grandmother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There it was , seen through the trunks of the trees , the lovely lake of Frieswater . In the summerit would hold a shield of red and white water lilies upon its breast , but they would not confront the sun with a greater splendor , Ben thought , than did the glinting surface of windrippledlight . David had said the light of the sun upon the wind-blown ripples seemed to him sometimes like the light of creative genius . " The wind bloweth where it listeth , " and sometimes at the touch of the mystery there is a flash of reflected light from the soul of a man , and a new life born from the flash , but sometimes the ripple passes lightless as the wind goes on no man knows where , even as no man knows from whence it came .... Something like that David had said . They drove slowly on until Ben cried , " Stop , Father ! The turning to the Hard . " George obediently stopped and they sat in silence looking at a scene that even Tommy loved intensely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made some of the greatest of England 's ships . Nelson 's Agamemnon had been built there , and many a glorious East Indiaman . Now there was nothing left of it but one enchanted fairy-tale street , a double row of old brick cottages with tumbled weatherworn red roofs facing a steep path bordered with green turf that sloped to the river . Once , this place had hummed with noise : the ring of hammer upon anvil , the rasping of the saws that hewed the oak logs into the great ships ' timbers , the clatter of the hammers and the whistling of the men at work upon a ship in the slips . Now there was silence , no sound but the whisper of the wind and the crying of the gulls that swooped and circled over the water . They could see the river down at the bottom of the little street , a wide tidal river sparkling and glinting in the sun . White swans rested upon it and small ships rocked at anchor . Beyond was a glorious stretch of green and tawny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were woods sweeping to the sky line . Not far away , unseen yet present to their thoughts , was the ruined abbey , whose bell in the old days had been heard by sailors far out to sea . The shadows of the clouds passed over this scene like the shadows of great wings and the peace of the place was indescribable . Tommy came to first , his eyes yearningly upon those small boats rocking at anchor . " Only darn fools live in London , " he said violently . Ben , who could quote whole chunks of The Wind in the Willows from memory , echoed the thought that he knew was in Tommy 's mind . " Believe mc , my young friend , there is nothing  --  absolutely nothing  --  half so much worth doing as simply messing about in boats . Simply messing  --  messingaboutin  --  boats  --  messing  --  ' " " That 'll do , " said George sharply , for he felt this sort of conversation to be somehow disloyal to Nadine . " Eyes right . Elf , where 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look at ? " Caroline , he knew , would have had the forethought to ask how to get there . Caroline was the only member of the Eliot family who ever had this kind of forethought . " You go through a gate between a barn and an oak tree , " said Caroline , " and then straight on along a lane . " The barn was facing them , and the old storm-twisted oak tree bent over the gate to lay its branches on the roof of the old barn . It was studded with new green leaves , coral-tipped , and they made a sort of canopy over the gate . Ben was out of the car in a flash and had opened it . " Always thought this gate led into a farmyard , " said George as he drove forward . " I did n't , " said Caroline softly . " I always had a feeling it led somewhere wonderful , but I was afraid to go and see , in case it didn't. " 21Ben had closed the gate again , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumped up onto the running board and swung there beside his father , lithe and graceful . His eyes met his father 's , and they were brimming with light . George glanced at Caro-84line and saw that her cheeks were bright pink with excitement . Behind him Tommy was giving his famous imitation of quackingducks faced with a lovely mess of really dirty weed , as was his habit in moments of happy anticipation , and the twins had ceased to be Rat and Mole and were giving their equally renownedinterpretation of an express train screaming with joy as it rushes headlong into a tunnel . But George , though the noise from behind smote with violence upon the back of his head , forbore to silence them . For really he did n't blame the kids . His own heart was beating rather faster than usual . The lane was narrow and winding , only just wide enough to take the car . It must have been of a great age , for it was very deeply sunken in the earth . Upon each side were grassy banks covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golden gorse above . Oak trees grew in the unseen field upon their right , and their wind-blown branches stretched right over their heads , turning the lane into that tunnel which had immediately changed the twins into the train . Looking up through the flame-tipped , burning young green leaves and the gray lichened twigs one could see the blue sky . Somewhere overhead a lark was singing madly . They went on a little farther and the lane turned off downhillto the left . It changed its character now . To their right above the steep bank of primroses was a most enchanting wood . " The Wild Wood ! The Wild Wood ! " cried Jose when she saw it . " The Wild Wood where Mr. Badger lived ! " To the left was an orchard of old gnarled apple trees with a gate leading into it . These trees , too , leaned over the lane and made a tunnel of it . Beyond the gate , in the lovely orchard , a rough track bordered with clumps of daffodils led away downhill . Down at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in a picture frame , was a blaze of sunlight and the river . Complete silence fell suddenly upon everyone , even the twins . The car slid down the lane , passed out into the sunlight , and stopped . And still no one spoke . In front of them the lane merged gradually into a beautiful fan-shaped little beach of smooth pebbles upon which the river lapped in gleaming ripples . To right and left of this beach a stout stone wall had been built , and it swept away to each side , 85taking the curve of the riverbank . A little rowing boat rocked upon the ripples , tied to a ring in the left-hand wall . Small stout ferns grew in the crevices of these walls and festoons of brambles hung over from above . To right and left flights of worn stone steps were built against the wall . The steps to the right led up to a small gate , painted green , that led into the wood , those to the left to another small gate , painted blue , leadinginto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the orchard upon the landward side , had old-fashioned box-bordered flower beds that were a tangled mass of scented red wallflowers growing round rosebushes , gooseberry bushes , rosemary bushes , and currant bushes , all incongruously but gloriously mixed together upon either side of the stone-paved path that led to the inn door . The inn itself was a fair-sized old house with bulging whitewashed , buttressed walls and a steep uneven roof of amber tiles patched with golden lichen . Windowslooked out of the white walls and the wavy roof at the most odd , unexpected levels . There did not seem to be a straight line anywhere , and yet the old place gave no impression of decay . On the contrary , it looked immensely strong , as strong as a fortress , glowing and safe , friendly and warm and most deeply alive . The front door was of very old oak , and looked as though it had once been a ship 's door . Over it a painted sign was fastened to the wall of the house . It was dim and weatherworn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see anything of it except a soft blur of blue and green . Yet they none of them seemed able to move . The beauty of this place had laid a spell upon them . It seemed too good to be true . They were afraid that if they moved it would all vanish . Tommy , as ever , recovered first . " I believe there 's a boathouseround there to the right , " he said . " I can see a bit of it . One would get to it through the wood . " " There does n't seem to be anybody about , " said Ben . " Let 's go and knock on the door , " said Caroline . Then they all tumbled out of the car and ran up the steps to the blue gate , and through it into the garden . They walked up the paved path to the old ship 's door , George coming last , holding Jerry and Jose firmly by the hand . Yet the twins were still astonishingly quiet . Accustomed as they were to being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairy tale that had suddenly encompassed them without any volition of their own slightly bewildering . They could n't imagine what was going to happen next and awaited it in breathless silence . The whole family stood in a group looking up at the signboard . It had upon it a delicate design of blue flowers and narrow green leaves . Above the flowers were the words " Herb of Grace o ' Sundays , " and down below , where the roots of the flowers were shown stretching down into the earth , in much smaller letters , " Maison Dieu . " " Gosh , but it 's old ! " ejaculated Ben . " Why , it 's a pilgrim inn ! " His relatives looked at him expectantly . It was always to Ben that the Eliots turned for enlightenment about odd , unexpectedthings . Tommy could always tell you all you wanted to know about internal combustion engines and the working of your own digestive organs , or how to put in a new fuse or mend a puncture , but Ben had the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the habits of birds and the derivationof names and the sources of legend . In London he spent a lot of time browsing in secondhand bookshops or among the books in David 's flat , for David had that kind of mind too . " H 'm ? " inquired George . " There were always hostels for pilgrims near the great abbeys and cathedrals , " said Ben . " They were called maisonsdieu . They 're the very oldest inns of all . Very few of them left now . " " And Herb of Grace o ' Sundays ? " asked Caroline . " It 's the narrow-leaved rue , " said Ben . " The country peopleused to grow it over the graves in the churchyards . " " Why ? " asked Tommy . But for once Ben was stumped , and chuckling at having caught him out , Tommy knocked loudly upon the door . A light step sounded inside and it swung open , revealing Jill standing on the threshold dressed in green overalls with a pattern of blue flowers , her eyes soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caroline flew into her arms . She had never forgotten Jill . It was Jill 's and Grandmother 's unfailing tender-871ness that had given to her rather insecure childhood a stability it would not have had without them . " Miss Caroline ! How you 've grown , dear , and Master Ben and Master Tommy , too , " said Jill , holding Caroline to her with her left arm and holding out her right hand to Ben . He gripped it warmly . He had n't forgotten her , either , or how the simplicity of her remarks had always comforted him , drawingattention as they always did to the eternal verities , like growth and the weather . Tommy grinned at her , remembering how she had never given him away when he ladled his porridgeinto the marmalade pot . " Good afternoon , sir , " said Jill to George . " It 's a lovely fine day , is n't it ? Warm for the time of year . " " Good afternoon , Jill , " said George , and the immense relief he felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years younger . " Here you are , " he added , and swung the twins forward , and Jill received them , a hand held out to each , as a fresh runner receives from a spent one a couple of valuable but fatiguingly heavy packages that must be carried along to the end of the way though the heavens fall . She braced her shoulders as she looked at the twins , and then smiled as though she felt herself equal to it . " Jerry and Jose , " she said softly , smiling at them . " And I 'm Jill . Three J 's . We 'll be happy . " And the twins , still most extraordinarily well behaved , smiled back at her . They liked the firm clasp of her hands , her even voice , her steady eyes . They knew instinctively that she would always be the same , not hugging them one moment and scolding them the next , and neither for any apparent reason , but reasonable and even-tempered and to be relied upon like the ground beneath their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir ? " invited Jill . " The kettle 's on the boil and I 've just baked some scones . " " We did n't mean to put you to any trouble , Jill , " said George . " We 've really come to bring a note from my wife and to ask your aunt if we may look at the inn . It 's of historical interest , I understand , and Lady Eliot thought we ought to take a look at it before it changes hands . " " Auntie Rose and I will be pleased to show you over , sir , " 88said Jill . " But you 'll have tea first , wo n't you ? It 's no trouble and the children will be hungry . " George , handing her Nadine 's note , liked the way she spoke to him , with no shyness or coquetry , respectfully , yet showing him firmly that she put the children 's hunger before his own desire for archaeological research . They all trooped in , the old ship 's door shut behind them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most royally and loudly welcomed , almost as though some generous , glowing personality had shouted aloud at the sight of them . They looked about them , but there was no one with them in the stone-flagged passage except Jill . To their right beautiful oak paneling reached from floor to ceiling , to their left an oak partition reached not quite elbow-high , and they looked over it between old oak posts , strangely carved with birds and beasts , into the bar . A few steps farther and the partition ended , giving entrance to the bar . It was the most attractive bar parlor George had ever set eyes upon . The bar itself , with a door behind it that evidently led through into the kitchen , was against the inner wall , facing the wide window set in the huge thickness of the outer wall , and looking out upon the garden . The ceiling was not so low as the ceilings of old houses so often are , and was whitewashed and crossed by strong oak beams . There was an open fireplace in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mantel , and two old settles with crimson cushions to either side of it . There were crimson curtains at the window and red rag rugs on the snowy stone floor . There were other treasures , too : a grandfather clock , very old brass spittoons , old sporting prints upon the walls , but George 's eye was caught away from them by the glory of the staircase that exactly faced the front door . It was of black oak and highly polished with age , each stair sagging in the middle like a bent bow . It sloped up between high paneled walls , then divided and curved away to right and left beneath an alcove in the paneling where there must once have been a cupboard , and that now held some strange little carved figure that he could not make out in the dim light . The sweep of this dividing staircase was most beautiful and gracious , and gave one a feeling of welcome like strong arms held out , the arms of that glow-89ing personality who had welcomed them in . And Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure of the staircase , with the arms held out beneath the upright panel , was like a cross . " We go this way , " said Jill , and lifted the latch of a door that was so a part of the paneling to the right of the passage that they had not seen it until she opened it . " It 's Auntie Rose 's parlor , " she said with pride , and stood back for them to enter . George exclaimed in delight . It was a lovely little room , paneled in green-painted wood . It had two windows , a small one looking over the garden through which they had come , and a large one looking out over another patch of garden , that was now a swaying mass of daffodils , and over the low wall to the river with the marshes and the woods beyond . The room was full of silvery light reflected upwards from the river . There was a floor of dark oak , and fine old candle sconces upon the walls . It was furnished according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suite " upholstered in puce velvet , lace curtains at the windows , a very ugly carpet , innumerable embroidered cushion covers and antimacassars , and pictures in gold frames of gentlemen in cocked hats bowing to ladies in crinolines , all of them with exactly the same face . The fireplace was truly terrible , a heavy overmantel trimmed with red velvet and a surround of imitation black marble , but George noticed that the basket grate was old and that the black marble was obviously a superimposedstructure .... Yet through these things the beauty of the room shone like the sun through mist . " What Mother could make of this ! " ejaculated George suddenly to Ben , and Ben nodded .... I le had already seen in his mind 's eye just what Mother would make of it . " This house is just like Damerosehay , " cried Caroline in delight . " It 's not in the least like it , " retorted Tommy a little contemptuously , and Caroline flushed painfully . Ben took her arm and pinched it comfortingly . " Exactly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old houses gave one the feeling of havingbeen built from inside as well as from outside , as though the men and women who had made them were not only the actual masons and carpenters , but those who had lived in them90too , and had put them forth bit by bit from their own souls and bodies like a squirrel building his cage in a tree , or a badger his holt in the ground . And the strength of their blood and bones still lived on in the wood and stone of each house , plain for all to see , and something of their spirits lived on in the two houses . The spirit , though so ancient , was not yet full-grown ; it waited on those who would come for the perfect flowering . It was like that at Damerosehay and it was like that here . " What aspect ? " asked George . " South , " said Jill . " The river takes a bend here , you see , sir , so that this room looks due south and gets all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sunsets are lovely behind the wood . This way , sir . Tea 's ready in the kitchen . " She opened a door in the east wall beside the fireplace , and they went through into a small square room paneled in dark oak that also looked towards the river . It was uncarpeted , and there was nothing in it except a few boxes and a sewing machine . " It 's just a passage room and we do n't seem to have much use for it , " said Jill apologetically . " A library and studio combined , " said Ben . " Lined with books . A table in the window . There 'd be a good light if one wanted to paint or write or anything like that . " " Good place to store fishing tackle , " said George . " Put up a partition , " said Tommy . " Make a passage out of this end . You could have a door with green bottle glass in it to give light in the passage . The bottom part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , and work at my anatomy at the table in the window . " George and Ben said no more about painting or fishing tackle . Tommy always had what he wanted . This room was now dedicated to books and bones . " There are two kitchens , " said Jill . " One behind the bar parlor , where we do all the work , and one through here where we live . " She opened a door opposite to the one by which they had entered and they went down two steps into the most glorious room of all , the living-kitchen . It was a large room , stonefloored , with whitewashed walls and great beams crossing a whitewashed ceiling , and with a fine old oil lamp hanging from91the central beam . There was a wide fireplace with a fire burning in it and a kettle singing on the hearth , and two wide windows , one looking south towards the river , the other east onto the stable yard . The room was furnished with old furniture : a splendid oak table , a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , high-backed rush-seated chairs , and a rocking chair . There were some fine bits of Bristol ware upon the mantelpiece , flowered chintz curtains at the windows , strips of plain matting upon the floor , and pots of geraniums upon the window sills . The table was laid for tea with a **29;3616;TOOLONG , willow-pattern china , a homemade cake , scones , and honey . The room was gracious , lived in , warm , glowing , and altogether glorious .... And extraordinarily familiar . . Standing there in the sunlight and firelight George and the children felt as though they had come home . They looked at each other , but they could not speak . " Auntie Rose did think of running the inn as a guesthouse at one time , " said Jill . " That was after they put on the busses to Radford and people started going there of an evening instead of coming here , so that as an inn it was n't a paying concern any more . But she did n't feel equal to it . It would have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , the green parlor , the lounge , and this kept private for the family . " " A lovely guesthouse for tired people , " said Caroline with shining eyes . " I could leave school and help Mother run it . " " One would be a fool not to keep this room exactly as it stands , " murmured George . " Jill , is the furniture as well as the house for sale ? " Jill looked doubtful . " Auntie Rose is very attached to all the things in the parlor , " she said . " The pictures were her wedding presents , and all the cushions and antimacassars she embroidered herself , and that lovely suite she and Uncle bought for their silver wedding . But I do n't think she sets much store by the things here . They 're old , and shabby , too , and belonged to her mother-in-law . Nor yet I do n't think she cares much for anything in the bar parlor . That 's all shabby old stuff too . " " I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her parlor , " George assured Jill . " It 's these things here  --  " " Auntie 's in the other kitchen , " said Jill . " We 'll ask her . " 92They went through into the farther kitchen , but Auntie Rose had disappeared . This kitchen , too , was delightful , with a north window looking out into the orchard and an east windowlooking out on the stable yard . It had the same white-washed walls and the same oak beams crossing a whitewashed ceiling , but here the wide hearth had a cooking range in it , the long table was of scrubbed deal , and the dresser of pitch pine . But there were brass pots and pans on the mantelpiece , bunches of herbs and another fine old oil lamp hanging from the ceiling , a cuckoo clock upon the wall , queer old bulging cupboards everywhere , and best of all in the children 's eyes , an open door in one corner showed the beginning of a stone-turret staircasewinding away into the darkness to one knew not what . " Auntie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened a door in the east wall that led into a porch like the one at Damerosehay , a porch as big as a little room , with seats upon either side . They went through into the stable yard , and George saw with satisfaction that the rough road leading from the lane through the orchard to the stable yard was wide enough for a good-sized car , and that some of the stable buildingswould be easily convertible into garages . This yard was beautiful , with its old rounded cobbles and green-painted pump . The stable buildings were of mellowed garnet-colored brick , roofed with those same amber tiles that roofed the inn . The place reminded George of an old London mews , for opposite the house a flight of steps built against the wall led up to what had obviously once been a coachman 's living quarters . There was a beautiful wrought-iron handrail protecting the stairs , with a small balcony above , upon which opened two windows , one on either side of a green door . " There 's a bit of vegetable garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onions . " And then Auntie Rose came towards them from the orchard with a little basket of bantam 's eggs . " For the children 's tea , " she murmured , in her soft yet brisk old voice . " They 'll be hungry , the dears . And in London , so they tell me , you 've but the one egg a month , and that addled as likely as not . " " This is Mrs. Spelman , my Auntie Rose , " said Jill to George . " The General 's taken a real fancy to the place , Auntie . " 93helped himself to his sixth scone . George , remembering the lunch they 'd had , was ashamed of them . " It 's all right , sir , " Jill , who was sitting beside him , said softly . " There 's plenty , and country food is good for children . Master Ben and Miss Caroline will soon put on weight when you 've settled here , and Master Ben will lose that nasty cough . " " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George looked at his two eldest . Yes , they were too thin and fine-drawn . And though Nadine said it was nothing , he had been worried about Ben 's cough for a long time now . They had taken their full share of family anxiety through the war . Carefreecountry holidays were exactly what they needed . " Messing about in boats ... simply messing about in boats . " They ate all there was to eat and then Auntie Rose took them up the turret staircase . Halfway up there was a small arched door in the stone wall . It was of very old oak studded with nails , and looked as though it might lead into a dungeon . " What 's in there ? " demanded the twins as one child . " Only my storeroom , ducks , " said Auntie Rose . " Let 's see , " commanded the twins . Obediently Auntie Rose fished a large key out of her capaciouspocket and unlocked the door . She had scarcely got it ajar when the twins were inside , squeaking with delight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Grace had enchanted them yet . George was at a loss to understand their pleasure . The little room was attractive in its strange , octagonal shape , and its narrow lancet windows were attractive too , but the stone floor was very worn , and the room was papered with a rather dirty , mustard-colored paper with chocolate-colored lozenges upon it . Slatted shelves , bulging and stained with age , were nailed round the walls , and supported a large assortment of black bottles and brown crocks , of all shapes and sizes , filled with Auntie Rose 's home-brewed wines , pickles , and preserves . " I keep it locked so that no one sha n't get at me wines , " explainedAuntie Rose . " All me own make  --  cowslip and elderberrywine and sloe gin . There 's a big cellar down below , sir , for the stout and cider and beer  --  what there is of it these days . The cellar door is behind the bar . " 95 " I 'm pleased to hear that , sir , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agent 's hands yet , or advertised it in any way . Lady Eliot , she wanted me to give you the first refusal . " " Lady Eliot  --  what did you say ? " asked George . " It was an honor to see her ladyship , " said Auntie Rose . " Came herself , she did , to see Jill and tell her to answer Mrs. Eliot 's advertisement . So anxious , she is , to have you living in the country near her . Yes , sir , I said you should have the first refusal . I was glad to oblige her ladyship . Is the kettle on , Jill ? " They were all going back into the house . George came last , moving like a sleepwalker . He took out his handkerchief and mopped his forehead . Auntie Rose presided very charmingly over the tea party . She was of the old school and respected what she still called " the gentry , " and because of her respect felt perfectly at home with them . Feeling no necessity for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be just herself , and was happy . And Auntie Rose 's self was delightful . She was a little roundabout woman with rosy cheeks and round blue eyes and white hair done up in a bun on the top of her head ; she was marvelously attired in a gray-brown tweed skirt , a purple satin blouse , and high button boots . Auntie Rose had not moved with the times , and was as restful as are all things and persons who seem impervious to change . She was about as restful as the I Icrb of Grace itself . " Mrs. Spelman , how can you endure to leave this beautiful place ? " asked George , drinking hot , strong , sweet tea poured out of a large brown earthenware teapot , and wondering why tea always tastes so much better when it is poured out of a brown teapot than out of any other kind . " I 'm gettin ' old , sir , and it 's a burden on me now . I 'm lookin ' forward to takin ' me ease with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've never let that trouble me . Jill , now , she 's the one for beauty , lettin ' a saucepan boil over while she looks at a rainbow , but then she 's had the time for it , while I 've had too much to do between dawn and sunset to waste me time lookin ' at ' em .... Another egg , dearie ? " Jerry graciously accepted another bantam 's egg and Tommy94 " What beautiful Easter eggs on the paper ! " cried Jose in ecstasy . " Wizard , " ejaculated Jerry . But no one else seemed to like the little room much except Ben , who lingered at the door a moment feeling in the room some indefinable attraction , almost as though there were buried treasure here . They went on up the staircase to see the rooms upstairs . There were eight of them altogether , with several large attics up above in the roof . Upstairs was an enchanting place , with odd corners , surprising little flights of steps , unexpected windows , and deep cupboards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ceilings ; there were the murmuring of birds beneath the eaves , the smell of lavender and furniture polish . The walls were papered with old-fashioned flowered wallpaper , bright and gay , and there was some priceless old furniture to which Auntie Rose seemed entirely indifferent , if not actively hostile . " It all belonged to me mother-in-law , " she said . " Barrin ' me lovely brass bedstead . " Casually she mentioned the price she had been advised to ask for the house and it was surprisingly reasonable . Provided she might have her precious suite and the hideous brass bedstead she was prepared to sell all the rest of the furniture . George began making frantic calculations upon the back of an envelope . They 'd get a good price for the Chelsea house . They could borrow from the bank . It could be done . Run as a guesthouse ( but he liked the old-world " inn " better ) the place was bound to pay . Nadine was a wonderful organizer , and abandoning himself to wishful thinking he assured himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more easily come by in the country than in the town and he 'd be there to help her . The words " there to help her " sang in his mind like a song . Together , working together , planning together , coming closer to each other than they had ever done in their difficult married life of constant separation , estrangement , difficult adjustment , and then separation again , and estrangement again , and bitterness and sorrow , and always in his soul that desperate longing to be loved by Nadine as he loved her , wholeheartedly . . He stumbled upon one of the unexpected steps , dropped96the envelope , and entirely forgot to ask Auntie Rose if there was a bathroom . " May we go down the front stairs , please ? " Ben was saying when he came back to awareness of his surroundings . " I want to look at the deer . " " What deer , me love ? " asked Auntie Rose . " The one in the alcove where the stairs branch , " said Ben . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little old stone goat ? " asked Auntie Rose . " It 's nothin ' to look at , dearie . Just some rubbishy old thing me husband dug up in the onion bed . Throw it in the river , Fred , ' I said , but he would put in there in that cupboard place . After he died I 'd meant to throw it out , and then I had n't the heart . Set store by it , Fred did . He 'd take queer fancies for all sorts of rubbish , Fred would . Odd chap , he was , though a good husband , and in the trade though he was , only took a glass too much once in a way as a matter of business . There it is , dearie . " They had come halfway down the lovely branching staircase and stood before the alcove in the paneling , looking at the little stone figure that Auntie Rose had thought was a goat . But Ben , even from below , had known better . He stood now looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cursory glance at what seemed to be a bit of carved stone of no particularattraction and nearly worn away by weather , looked at Ben , puzzled by his rapt attention . He stretched out a hand as though to touch the creature , then drew it back as though he felt his touch might be a profanation . " Pick it up , ducks , " said Auntie Rose with a touch of impatience . " It wo n't bite . Stone , it is . " Ben took the little image very gently into his hands . " It 's a deer all right , " he said . " Look at the curve of the neck , the antlers . " Suddenly he caught his breath . " Look at the way the antlers are carved , holding up a cross . " " H 'm ? " said George . " Yes , " insisted Ben . " Look . " His thin , sensitive fingers passed over the little figure like the fingers of a sculptor over the clay , and for a brief moment the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw : a beautiful white deer with a proud neck and a delicatepointed face beneath the spreading antlers that unmistakablybranched inwards to form a cross . Then the sudden flash died to a spark that lit his own vision only , and the others saw what they had seen before , just a worn stone image of some little animal with horns , only they saw now that it was possibly a deer , and that the horns were undoubtedly twisted in a rather unusual way . " Must be very old though , " said George with respect . " This was a pilgrim inn , " said Ben , putting the little deer gently back into his niche . " I expect , if we knew where to look , we 'd find frescoes of lives of the saints hidden under the wallpapers , and perhaps more holy images that tumbled off the roof into the garden . " Ile looked at Auntie Rose . " Was this the only one you ever found ? " " Fred found a few odd broken bits , diggin ' the garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did throw out when he was gone . Not one of them had a head to it even . He 'd only kept ' em because of some old wives ' tale his great-granny had told him when he had the scarlet fever as a lad . " " What tale ? " demanded Ben sharply . Auntie Rose rubbed her nose , trying to recollect it . " Somethin ' about some old monk from the Abbey who had a fancy for birds an ' beasts . He built a chapel in the woods , Fred 's great-granny told him , an ' he 'd feed the creatures there , an ' tend to ' em when they were sick . Just some tale the old greatgrannymade up to keep Fred quiet when he had the fever on him . But Fred , he believed it . He 'd swallow anythin ' , Fred would . An ' he got the notion that old monk had carved the animals that fell off the roof , an ' those birds an ' beasts there on the wooden pillars . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could get ' cm so lifelike . Loved animals , Fred did . Would n't never shoot anythin ' .... Soft he was . " Ben let out a sigh of exasperation . " Auntie Rose , you ought n't to have thrown away the other holy images , even though they had no heads . " " Is that a holy image ? " asked Jerry , gazing round-eyed at the deer . " Yes , " said Ben. 98 " What 's a holy image ? " asked Jose , also round-eyed . " Something someone makes for the love of God , " said Ben steadily . George and Tommy both shot up their left sleeves and looked at their wrist watches , the invariable custom of both of them when embarrassed . The twins and Ben were continually embarrassing them , the twins by the questions they asked , and Ben because he never evaded their questions but answered them with the truth as he saw it . " Then a house could be a holy image , " said Caroline . " Yes , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Yes , " said Ben . " Gosh , it 's late ! " interrupted Tommy firmly . " Better be getting along , " agreed George . " Mother will be getting anxious . Thank you more than I can say , Mrs. Spelman , for your kindness and patience , and the splendid tea you gave these children . " " A pleasure , sir , " said Auntie Rose as they went down the stairs . " And I 'll be hearin ' from you ? " " As soon as possible . But I must consult my wife , of course . " " Of course , sir . " They trooped out into the garden and saw the wood all lit up by the westering light as though a thousand candles had been lit upon the trees that stretched their shade deep beyond deep in the dark wood . The water was all aglint too , and the colors of the flowers burned pure and still . The sky was a deep blue-green overhead , and three wild swans were flying upriver to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world but the beat of the birds ' wings and the soft lapping of the water against the old stone walls . They stood for a moment at the gate at the top of the steps and the peace held them silent . Then Tommy clicked the gate open , Jill kissed the twins , and they went down the steps to the car. 3Driving home , the children kept up a perfect racket of excitedchatter , but George felt worse and worse . What or .. earth was Nadine going to say ? How on earth had it all come about ? 99What had he said , what had anybody said , to start them off on this wild idea of buying the Herb of Grace and turning it into an inn ? He could n't for the life of him remember . He was , of course , not committed to anything ; it was perfectly possible to back out .... But appalled though he felt , the prospect of back . ing out made him feel worse still .... How could he disappoint the children ? They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappoint himself ? Entering the Herb of Grace had been to him a home-coming ; just that . But it must be as Nadine wished . Everything , always , must be as Nadine wished ; that was the guiding principle of his life . But she would n't wish to live at the l lerb of Grace ; he felt dead certain of that . He wished to goodness the expression of her wishes were over . It was n't going to be pleasant , the first half hour after they reached home . He wished she 'd been with them this afternoon , or that she 'd seen the place before they did , for if she had they 'd never have got themselves into this mess .... Then a curious suspicion flashed into his mind . Had Lucilla , or had she not , seen to it that Nadine should not see the place before they did , should not accompany them this afternoon ? And what was this Lucilla had said to Auntie Rose about giving him the first refusal of the place ? ... Undoubtedly his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games here . Abruptly his wearied mind ceased from thought . He 'd say nothing when they got home . He 'd just let things take their course . They started to take them as soon as the car drew up at the front door of Damerosehay . Lucilla and Nadine and Margaret , coming out to welcome the travelers , were told by Jerry at the top of his voice , " There 's a lovely house with a wild wood and Daddy 's going to buy it and we 're all going to live there ! " " What nonsense you talk , darling , " said Nadine . " But it 's true , Mummy ! " yelled Jose , and then all four children began to talk at once , so that no one could hear a word . " That 'll do , darlings , " said Lucilla , somehow or other managing to quell the riot without even raising her voice , as was her miraculous habit . " Supper is ready . Wash your hands quickly and come along . " Hands were washed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , long past the twins ' bedtime , but asIoothey were much too excited for sleep Lucilla decreed that they should absorb their biscuits and milk with their elders , while those elders were attacking stewed rabbit , rhubarb , and cheese straws , an unusually magnificent repast to which Margaret had mounted , as though upon eagle 's wings , because George was present . The moment the pangs of hunger had been slightly allayed the children started talking again , and once more it was difficult to disentangle one thing from another . " Let Tommy tell us , " suggested Lucilla . Tommy 's jaws , champing upon rabbit , stilled for a moment in surprise . He was no raconteur , and it was generally Ben who was called upon for a coherent story . But he was subtly flatteredby his grandmother 's choice of himself , and pausing only to remove an obstruction from his mouth and identify it as a piece of the tibia , he plunged into enthusiastic narrative , his rosy face ablaze with excitement , his bright dark eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was .... Lucilla had known what she was doing when she directed the full battery of Tommy 's guns upon his mother 's heart , for the disappointingof Tommy was a thing of which Nadine had never yet found herself capable . " You 're taking things too much for granted , old boy , " George 's voice cut in upon Tommy 's enthusiastic description of the little room where he was going to keep his bones . " Mother has not seen the house yet . She may decide it 's not quite her cup of tea . " Tommy waved this interruption aside as unworthy of attention and plunged into a description of the boats they would have in the boathouse . " It all sounds lovely but wildly beyond our means , " said Nadine , when it was next possible to get a word in edgeways . She had gone rather white , and was crumbling her bread and not getting on with her rabbit . " That 's all right , Mother , " said Tommy . " Father 's going to leave the army and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll simply coin money . " " Will we ? " asked Nadine . " I suppose there was electric light laid on ? George ? " George wrinkled his brows , tried to rid himself of some IOIsort of vague vision of beautiful oil lamps hanging from equally beautiful old beams , but was saved from the necessity of answeringby Ben , who had been devouring rabbit at great speed while Tommy talked , but now laid his knife and fork down on his empty plate and with shining eyes began to tell them a few facts about inns that he had picked up from a book David had . " Ours is a pilgrim inn , Mother , a maison-dieu . All the rooms would have been called after different saints . The old inns all gave their rooms names , you know . The secular ones were named after flowers , mostly . I wonder who painted our sign . Great artists painted the inn signs sometimes , Mother : Hogarth , Moreland , David Cox . You know , Mother , the early plays were given in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the galleries than ran round the yard .... I tell you what , next Christmas we 'll act a play at the Herb of Grace ! Would n't it be a lark ! .. . When the guests come we wo n't allow tips , of course . They never had tips in the old days . The tip did n't come in till the thirteenth century . Mother , do you know the difference between an inn and a public house ? The inn is bound to give shelter , rest , and food to the wayfarerat any hour , but the public house is not . Mine Host always greeted the guest and gave him a complimentary glass of wine . Father 'll be good at that , and you 'll be a wonderful hostess , Mother . We 'll have to have a hall porter , a waiter , and a garage mechanic , but we 'll give them the old names : chamberlain , drawer , and ostler . " " You 'll be chamberlain , " interrupted Caroline suddenly , her cheeks as pink as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tommy ostler . " " You 're at home very little , " Nadine reminded them dryly . " We 're at home in the holidays , " Tommy told her , " and the holidays  --  Christmas , Easter , the summer  --  are just when visitors will come . We 'll do all the work , Mother ; Father and us . You wo n't have anything to do except look lovely . We 'll get a cook . " " Where from ? " asked Nadine . " And was there a bathroom ? " No one seemed to know , and there was a short silence , brokenby Jose . " There 's a river , " said Jose . " A river for Rat . " " And a Wild Wood , " said Jerry. 102 " And a Person with Horns in the Wild Wood , " said Jose . " It lives in the chapel in the woods that the man made who liked animals . " " What does she mean ? " demanded Caroline . " She 's mixing up the deer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , " said Ben . His eyes met his grandmother'sand she knew that sometime , when they were alone together , he would have something to tell her , some old legend , such as they both delighted in . Meantime supper was finished , and Lucilla , smiling at him , got up . " Well , children , " she said , " Mother will see about it in the morning . " Nadine , not committing herself , white-faced and tight-lipped , went upstairs to put the twins to bed . Margaret and Caroline went to the kitchen to do the washing up , and Lucilla to the drawing room with her son and grandsons . There she immediatelysuggested bridge , and George got no chance at all to ask her what on earth she had been up to .... Nadine did not return . ... They played for an hour , George continually forgetting what was out , and then he could stand it no longer , pleaded a headache , went upstairs , and knocked at Nadine 's door . " Come in , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in bed with a book in her hands , a frilly dressing jacket round her shoulders . In the light of her bedside candles she looked absurdly young and altogether lovely . The blood drummed in George 's already aching temples and he caught his breath . He went to the foot of the bed and gripped the old-fashioned brass rail at the bottom of it tightly in both hands . " Nadine ! " he whispered . " I do n't believe you 've even unpacked yet , darling , have you ? " she asked in a light , hard voice . " And I do n't believe Grandmother told you she 'd put us in separate rooms . " Her cruelty was like the lash of a whip in his face and he went white . An agony of pity and remorse seized her . That was the second detestably cruel thing she had said today . What was coming over her ? What was happening to her ? " George ! George ! I 'm sorry ! " she cried . " I did n't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darling . Come and sit on my bed and let 's talk . " He came slowly and sat beside her , and she chafed one of103his cold hands between her warm ones , murmuring endearments as she would have to the twins . But she could n't undo it . Once again , she had made it clear to him that his lifelong passion was to her nothing but a burden that she must bear .... And never by look or word had he let her guess what a lifelong burden to him must be her lack of response to his love .... In giving up David she had made for him an immense and splendid sacrifice , yet it seemed to her at this moment that she perpetuallyrendered it useless by her cruelty . What was the matter with her that the quality of that action seemed powerless to affect the stuff of her daily living ? Lucilla , whose early history had been so like her own , had made her unloved husband utterly happy , and had come in the end to love him . Lucilla had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , consciously or unconsciously , which she was not doing . As she had thought this morning , something was lacking in her  --  some herb of grace . " Nadine , " said George miserably , " about this damn inn . Mother has been up to something about it , but I give you my word I do n't know what . When I started off this afternoon I 'd no more idea of buying the place than of buying the Albert Memorial . But when I was there . .. I do n't know what happened ... the place gave us such a welcome .. . like a personal welcome .. . " " I believe you , " said Nadine . " I 've never known you get entangled in Grandmother 's schemes for our good other than unconsciously . You liked this house ? " " It felt like home , " said George wretchedly . " Then we 'll buy it , and if you 'd like to do that , run it as an inn . " He gazed at her in stupefaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Nadine . " All those furnishedhouses we 've lived in since we married , that detestable Indian bungalow where we quarreled so badly , they were none of them home . The Chelsea house was my home , but not yours . The Herb of Grace will be our home , yours and mine . Our first . " A ridiculous desire to weep kept George silent , but he crushed104her hands in his till she nearly screamed with the pain . " You have n't even seen the place , " he muttered at last . " We 'll go tomorrow . Just you and I. " " You may hate it . " " No . I do n't think I shall . I need it  --  the Herb of Grace .... " Then he began talking , as Tommy had done , as Ben had done , with shining eyes like Caroline 's , pouring out his plans for the boathouse , the house , the garden , and the orchard . She listened , smiling agreement , while her exhausted spirit cried out in terror within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so desperately tired . . And she 'd only just repainted her beloved Chelsea house ... . A little of her deadly fatigue must have showed in her face at last , for he jumped up full of contrition . " You 're dead beat , " he said , bending to kiss her . " Selfish beast that I am . Get a good sleep , darling , and we 'll go and see the old place in the morning . " And he went off jaunty as a schoolboy , and she blew out the candles and lay staring with desperation into the dark . Before he came to her she had been steeling herself for refusal , resolutely steeling herself against the passionate enthusiasm that she would never have allowed to develop had she been with them  --  and how well Grandmotherhad known that  --  steeling herself even to the point of disappointing her adored Tommy . And then she had said that cruel thing to George and her horror at herself had betrayed her . " Hoisted with my own petard , " she said . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruffling with its light whisper the deep calm peace of the night . Was she sorry ? Her body began weeping from sheer weariness , yet she felt her spirit move within her , and with eagerness , like someone going home . She sobbed herself to sleep , yet when she slept she smiled 105Chapter VINo , she was not sorry , she decided five months later , as she sat at her escritoire , set in the window of her upstairs sitting room , and worked at her housekeeping books . It was a lovely little room , and perhaps had once been a powdering closet . It had been a box room in Auntie Rose 's day , and had been papered with church almanacs . But through the almanacs Nadine 's quick eye had seen the ridge of paneling , and the first thing they had done in this house had been to strip off the almanacs and disclose it . Now the paneling had been painted cream color and the little room furnished with Nadine 's eighteenth-century escritoire , a Sheraton chair with a tapestry seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with glass doors holding some precious bits of china . That was all the furniture there was room for , but there was a white sheepskinrug on the polished oak floor , a little old mirror hung on the wall , and there was a vase of late autumn roses on the escritoire . Beside Nadine , in her basket with its powder-blue cushion , Mary , the white Pekinese , lay fast asleep . The powder-blue curtains framed a view that in the past five months had mysteriously become part of Nadine 's very soul , which was odd , for views had not hitherto meant much to her . But then , she said to herself , they had none of them been this view . She laid down her pen , propped her chin in her hands , and feasted upon it . Just below her the strip of garden that stretched from the house to the river wall was a blaze of color : purple and white Michaelmas daisies , scarlet dahlias , and early yellow chrysanthemums . They were enjoying an Indian summer , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michaelmas daisies , and two slim willow wrens darted from flower clump to river wall and back again , appear-'o6ing too happy to stay still . The river was blue , almost as still today as the tawny marshes , and beyond , the golden October woods swept to the blue of the sky . Through the open window there came no sound except the soft lap of the water against the wall , and the tap of a hammer from the boathouse where Ben was messing about with boats . At the sound of that busy hammer Nadine 's face softened with sudden tenderness and compunction . Ben had not been able to go back to school this term . Lucilla had insisted that his mother take him to see a doctor about his cough , and his lungs were not satisfactory . Nothing to worry about , the doctor had said ; a few months of laziness and fresh air would probably put things right . But there might have been something to worry about if Lucilla had not taken action , and Nadine was ashamed . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to herself now . " I 've got too tired to want to bother about anything . It was a good thing for Ben 's sake that we came here . And George 's too ; he 's a new man . " Yes , this move had justified itself , even though after the wild activity of the past few months she was , if possible , even more tired than she had been before . Yet it was chiefly her body that was tired now ; her mind , which had been so weary and fretted in London , had been wonderfully rested by this house that was now her home . Hardly knowing what she did , she stretched out a hand and laid it upon the paneled wall beside her ; it was warm in the sun , as though it were alive . Increasingly , as she lived here , Nadine had a feeling that this house had a personality of its own , some sort of great angel who grew with the growth of the house and was enriched , or otherwise , by those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angel was well disposed towards her . It was a genial sort of angel , and remarkably patient . When she first arrived , with everything to do and feeling herself without the strength to do it , she had bitterly hated its body , the house , and it had suffered her hatred with the gentleness of an old dog who knows he gives offense with his matted coat , yet can not unaided mend matters , though he would die to please you . But her hatred had not lasted long , for the response of the house to her onslaughtsupon it had been so swift that the bitterness had ebbed107away , and in its place had come the deep companionable love of those who strive together for the glory of God . That had been Ben 's phrase . " For the glory of God ! " he had cried as he stripped the almanacs from the paneling , and he had shouted it again at the top of his voice when he and Tommy had torn away the terrible overmantel and surround in the drawing room and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protested at this battle cry , but Ben had stuck to it . This house was maison-lieu , and the stripping away of all that was unworthy and the building up of new beauty was in the nature of a crusade . And the house had agreed and collaborated . Nadine had a supreme gift for furnishing and decorating , but never had she so enjoyed putting her gift to use as she had during these last few months . The angel had seemed to work with her , telling her what to do and how to do it , as though he too were an artist ... . And it had been the house itself that had attracted to her assistance Malony , Annie-Laurie , and Smith . Nadine suddenly began to laugh as she thought of these three , after Jill her chief prop and stay , and dreaming in the sun she went back in memory to the first weeks at the Herb of Grace and the blessed day of their arrival. 2After the first few days she had declared with bitter passion that she would not stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathroom and a lamp cleaner were put in , and the mice put out . She realized it would he impossible to install electric light for a long time to come , and she agreed with George that lamplightand candlelight were very beautiful , but she was not going to do the lamps herself . Nor was she going to live here without a bathroom . Nor with the mice . And if George did not wish her to leave him again he must see to it . Having deliveredherself of this ultimatum she took a headache to her room , lay on her bed with it , and cried . George meanwhile spent the morning touring the neighborhood in the car and interviewing every plumber he could find , only to be told by each firm that though it would be delighted to undertake the General 's order at some future period , baths at present wereI08unobtainable . George bought ten mousetraps , and came home very crestfallen to find Caroline helping Jill prepare lunch , while Ben and Tommy , as hungry as hunters after a morning 's hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hope that that would hurry things on . But Nadine still lay in her room . It was the beginning of the summer holidays so the children were at home , with the exception of the twins . They were staying at Damerosehay in the care of Lucilla and Margaretso as to set Jill free to help get the house in order , and ease all friction with the oil of her gentle common sense . " We 'll send Mrs. Eliot her lunch on a tray , " she said now to the miserable George . " You shall take it yourself , sir . Tired out , she is . What beautiful mousetraps , sir . I do n't know when I 've seen finer mousetraps than those . " She laid the tray swiftly and deftly with a special invalid lunch , setting a little vase of flowers upon it . George tramped up the stairs with it , carried it with heavy tread to Nadine , and set it upon the table beside her bed , upsetting the vase of flowers as he did so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , mopping up the water , and hating herself now for her tears and her temper ; in the old prewar days she had never cried . " Did you have any luck about the bath ? " " No , " said George , " but I bought ten mousetraps . " " How splendid , " said Nadine . " What are you going to bait them with ? We eat all our cheese ration . " Again she hated herself , but George was not hurt this time by her sarcasm , for his attention was distracted by the most extraordinary chugging noise that came drifting in through the open window . He turned and looked out . " What the dickens ! " he ejaculated . Nadine , eying the perfectly fried fillets with approval , and thanking heaven that Jill knew how to cook as well as how to look after small children , glanced indifferently at the strip of river framed by the window . Then her indifference changed to interest , and she slipped off her bed and went to stand by George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river . It looked as though it had originally been a coal barge , though it was now fitted with a motor engine109and carried instead of coal the most extraordinary assortment of oddments that Nadine had ever seen . In the center of the barge was a bathing machine , its little windows hung with gay flowered curtains . Behind the bathing machine was strung a washing line from which brightly colored female undergarmentsfluttered out over what was apparently a vegetable garden planted in the stern of the boat . The front of the boat was filled up with the most amazing assortment of machinery ; above towered a flagpost from which fluttered the Union Jack . At the top of the flagpost was a curious bunch of scintillating brightness that at this distance could not be identified as anything in particular . There appeared to be a crew of three , a male figure dimly discernible among the machinery , a female figure tangled up in the washing , and a cat cleaning its whiskers on top of the bathing machine . The boat had been traveling slowly down-river , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed and it appeared that the crew were shouting remarks to each other . Then with much noise they steered for the shore and came to anchor beneath the garden wall . The lower part of the craft was now hidden from the astonished gaze of Nadine and George , but they could still see the flagpost with its flag , and the brightness above that now revealed itself as a bunch of bells that chimed softly and sweetly as the boat rocked to stillness . There were visible also the tops of some flourishing tomato plants growing in the vegetable garden , and the cat on top of the bathing machine . The latter was an immense tabby with a white shirt front , and it now ceased washing itself and gazed at Nadine and George with speculative interest . The top of a ladder now appeared above the garden wall . " Must be a sort of circus , " said Nadine . " Great Scott ! " ejaculated George . " They 're coming ashore ! " The man came first , climbing off the ladder onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And he was like a monkey to look at . Ile had a brown , sad , puckered face , and dark hair cropped short . Ile was small in stature , thin and wiry , clothed in dark-blue dungarees and sweater , with a bright red scarf knotted about his throat . No less nimble was the girl who followed him , though much better-looking . She looked at this distance about eighteen years old , very thin , light , and gracefulII0in her movements , with a little sunburned face delicately pointed at the chin , and wonderful , shining gold hair twisted in plaits about her small head . She wore a diminutive jade-green skirt and a yellow jumper , and her thin brown legs were bare . When the two of them were upon the wall the cat passed a paw thoughtfullybehind its left ear , then took a flying leap and landed behind them . With the agility of tightrope walkers the three of them then marched in single file along the top of the wall and vanished in the direction of the front door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy tread of Tommy marching to open the door , and then voices . " Had n't you better go down , darling ? " queried Nadine . But George was gazing like a man mesmerized at the bunch of bells and the Union Jack and the tops of the tomato plants . There was a racket on the stairs and Tommy burst in . George swung round . " Do n't make such a damnable noise ! " he shouted loudly . " Do remember that your poor mother has the most frightful headache . " " Sorry , " shouted Tommy , equally loudly . " Come along down , Father . There 's a splendid chap here , a sort of tinker . Mends anything . We 've asked him to lunch . " " Asked him to lunch ? " ejaculated Nadine . " Of course , Mother . This is an inn , you know , not a pub . We 're bound to give shelter and refreshment at any hour . " " Did he ask for lunch ? " demanded George . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scissors and knives and sell us tomatoes . I had to tell him we had n't got the beer in yet but we were having cider and Spam for lunch , and he said he could make do with that . The girl 's jolly nice too . Awful pretty . " " Go down at once , George , " said Nadine , her hand to her head . " And get rid of them . " " You ca n't get rid of them , " said Tommy indignantly . " This is an inn , I keep telling you . " George went , followed by Tommy . Nadine carried her tray to the window , put it on the broad sill , sat down , and began to eat her fish . She felt much better after she had eaten a little ; in fact , almost well . It was delicious fish but it would have been improved by a baked tomato . Nadine was of the school ofIIIthought that considers fish and tomatoes as inseparable as bacon and eggs . She finished her fish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and then looked thoughtfully at the tops of the tomato plants showing above the garden wall . She 'd just slip down , she thought , and sec if the tomatoes were worth buying . As she went down the stairs she heard a great clatter of knives and forks and conversation coming from the kitchen . George , evidently , had not found it possible to overrule Tommy 's invitation to lunch . She went out through the old ship 's door and round into the garden . Standing by the wall she found herself looking straight at the bunch of little bells at the top of the flagpost . They were pretty bells and she could fancy she still heard that fairy chiming coming from them . Then she took a look at the rest of the boat . It was most attractive . The bathing machine , a large one , had been divided to make two tiny cabins and a kitchen-living room . The kitchen had a little oil cooking stove in it , a tiny dresser with pretty china and some bright pots and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the wall , and a shelf for books . In each cabin was a bunk that could be used as a seat in the daytime , and from the roof of each hung an oil lamp . Nadine noted that these lamps had been well polished and well cared for by someone who evidently understood their tricks and their manners very well indeed . Then she turned her attention to the vegetable garden in the stern . It had two beds , one planted with tomato plants bearing beautiful ripe red tomatoes , and the other with lettuces and radishes with a border of pansies round the edge . These beds had been made  --  Nadine gazed and gazed again  --  by filling two large baths with earth . Two large baths . Her headache vanished as though it had never been . She did not hesitate . She hastened to the kitchen and entered upon a scene of conviviality that would scarcely have met with her approval had there been room in her mind for anything except baths . George , her children , Jill , and the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devouring Spam and salad off the beautiful willow-pattern china as though they had known each other for years . The cat was under the table , also partaking of nourishment off a willow-pattern plate . George , I12it was true , looked a little self-conscious , but he seemed to be enjoying himself all the same . Everyone else was completely at their ease , with the exception of Mary the Pekinese , who was sitting on the window sill gazing at the cat , and frozen stiff with horror at finding herself in such plebeian company . There was a vacant place at one end of the table , opposite George , and as soon as she saw Nadine Jill got up and pulled the chair back . " We hoped you would feel well enough to join us , madam , " she said . " You had such a light lunch . Could you fancy toast and a cup of coffee ? It wo n't take a minute . " " Yes , I could , Jill . Thank you , " said Nadine , and took the empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been hoping she would join them , but Jill could always be relied on to say what would best help everyone over an awkward moment . " My wife , " said George , red-faced but courtly . No matter how flustered he was always a good host . " Mr.  --  er  --  " " Jim Malony , " said the monkey-faced man , and standing up courteously he bowed to Nadine with the most surprising grace , his bright yet sad dark eyes twinkling with friendliness . " And this is my daughter , Annie-Laurie . " Annie-Laurie turned her little brown face towards her hostess and smiled shyly . She had a queer crooked smile like that of a beseeching child , though at a second glance one saw that she was very far from being a child . Her beautiful bright blue eyes were deeply and maturely anxious , and though her crooked smile had a child 's appeal it died very abruptly , and her lips in repose had a woman 's hard control . It was a resolutely sealed-in face , yet the hidden wretchedness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a naturally maternal woman , yet she had borne children , and at sight of that face she felt a stab of pain at her heart . She glanced at Jill , heating coffee at the kitchen stove , and their eyes met pitifully .. . . There was undoubtedlysomething very wrong with this girl . . .. And yet at the same time there was something very right with her , a direct simplicity in her beseeching , a vitality that leaped like a pure flame . Nadine answered the smile , but for once found herself without words . The rather painful little pause was broken by Tommy , who indicated the region below the kitchen table with a gesture . I13 " The cat Smith , " he told his mother . " Enjoying the trimmings of your fillets . " Then the conversation flowed on again where Nadine 's entrancehad interrupted it , rich and racy , upon the subjects of fish , boats , rivers , and riverside inns . It was sustained chiefly by Tommy and Jim Malony , but George , Ben , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Annie-Laurie said little . She ate daintily , and every now and then she smiled at her father with the tenderness of a woman who has heard her man 's tales many times before , but is glad to see him happy in their repetition . Her attitude to him was much more wifely than daughterly . And indeed he seemed scarcely old enough to be her father , for in spite of his puckered face he was obviously a youngish man . Nor was she in the least like him ; she was very fair beneath her sunburn . His attitude to her was obvious in every glance he sent her ; it was lovingly anxious , protective , like that of an adoring old watchdog . He was a born raconteur . Jokes , vivid little anecdotes , shreds and scraps of information about all sorts of out-of-the-way subjects kept them enthralled . He talked in a husky croaking voice that was yet unusually articulate , and his Irish brogue seemed too rich and glorious to be true . And Nadine did not think for a single moment that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malony was an Irishman than she believed he was what Tommy had said he was , a tinker . She did not know what he was . She was utterly nonplused by the pair of them . They were not of the class that she was accustomed to describe as working people , nor were they exactly gentlefolk . What on earth were they ? " Troubadour .... " It was Ben who had spoken . He was sitting next to his mother , Annie-Laurie upon his other side , and now that she had finishedher Spam and salad he had turned to her and was shyly and kindly trying to talk to her . " Your father is like a sort of troubadour , " he said . " You know , one of those men who traveled from house to house in the old days , telling wonderful tales and cheering everyone up " 114 " He 's always cheerful , " said Annie-Laurie . Her voice was clear and charming , educated , without the trace of an Irish accent , and when she turned to smile her crooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheek . " It seems the right place for a troubadour , this old house . They were the ancestors of the strolling players , were n't they ? And the old players liked best to play at inns . " " They played in the inn galleries , " Ben agreed enthusiastically . " And stepped onto their stages out of the lovely old rooms with their flower names : fleur-de-lis and herb of grace . " As she spoke she turned to smile at her hostess , and Nadine marveled at her knowledge and her grace . " Do you like flowers , Annie-Laurie ? " she asked . " You have some lovely pansies growing in the garden on your houseboat . " " I like flowers , children , birds , and animals , " said AnnieLaurie . " Anything that needs looking after . My pansies are pretty , but you ca n't grow many flowers just in a bath . It was because your garden was so lovely that my father and I stopped and had a look , and then the old house looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe , too , like a fortress . We hoped it was an inn and we came round to the front to see . But I think perhaps you are only using it as a private house and that we ought not to have asked to come in ? " " That 's all right , Annie-Laurie , " Nadine assured her . " It is going to be an inn one day , when we have got things straight . We have only just moved in , and nowhere , simply nowhere , can I find a bath to put in the bathroom we want to make . " " Bath , is it ? " inquired Mr. Malony . " Glory be to God , ma'am , I 've two baths ! " " Mr. Malony , " said Nadine , " I will pay you any price within reason you like to mention for those baths , and if you are a sufficientlyskilled workman to help our local plumber put them in for me I will double it . " " Ten quid the pair ? " suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our food , now , and I do n't know but what Annie-Laurie and I wo n't stay here until you 've got the place to your liking . There 's nothing Annie-Laurie ca n't do115cook , clean lamps , wash , iron , sew  --  and , glory be to God , there 's no mouser to touch Smith in the whole of the United Kingdom . Done , ma'am ? " " Done , " said Nadine. 31And they were still here , sleeping in their houseboat that was anchored now beyond the boathouse at the edge of the wood , spending their evenings there , but having their meals at the Herb of Grace , and toiling there from morning till night . They were invaluable . Malony , with such tact and humor that he gave no offense in the process , had helped a local plumber to install two bathrooms , one for the guests and one for the family . Procuring the paint from no-one-knew-where , he had repainted the house from top to bottom quite superbly . He had worked in the garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garage into order , scrubbed floors , washed up , cleaned shoes , polished silver , carried luggage , done anything and everything that his quick eye saw needed doing . In spite of the sadness of his face he was always cheerful and good-humored . They had already had a few guests , friends who came to give them a good send-off , as well as casual droppers-in , men from the Hard coming for a pint when the day 's work was over , picnic parties and river folk , and Malony had known exactly how to deal with all of them . With a green baize apron tied round his middle he shared the duties of hall porter ( only the children insisted upon the old name of chamberlain ) with Ben , and attired in a white apron or a leather one he was Tommy 's better half as waiter or garage mechanic , though woe betide him if he forgot to refer to himself as drawer or ostler . And upon the very rare occasions when there was a little liveliness at the inn at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Jill was helping Nadine with the cooking ( for they had no cook as yet ) , he minded the twins with a skill that came little short of genius . Annie-Laurie was as valuable as Malony . She took over entire charge of the lamps , and all the duties of a chambermaid . She was very nearly as good with the twins as Jill and Malony , and she was deeply attached to Mary the Pekinese . But thoughI16she was friendly she was not very forthcoming . She replied courteously and sweetly when spoken to , but she never told anybody anything , and all of them except Nadine found her reserve a little difficult to live with . But Nadine liked it . She liked Annie-Laurie , and she believed that Annie-Laurie liked her . There was a deep unexpressed sympathy between them . As for Smith , he was an animal of parts . He was an excellent mouser , prompt and efficient in the execution of his duties , but not lingering over them in the painful manner of so many mousers . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually found his presence at the Herb of Grace an added amenity . Malony had himself given Nadine and George a short sketch of his history . He had begun life as plumber and house decorator , which was how he had come by the baths , but a bad bout of pneumonia had left his lungs weak , and strengthening sea air having been ordered by his doctor he had started a bathingmachinebusiness . He had owned twelve bathing machines and done very well out of them , which was how he had come by the bathing machine . But the bathing business palled on him . He had a longing to see the world . He also had a pal who was a bargeman , but who was sick of it and wanted to settle down . They did an exchange , the pal taking over six of the bathing machines and Malony the barge , which he made into an excellent houseboat with the help of one of the bathing machines and an engine which another pal gave him in exchange for the remaining five . Smith had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possession with the barge . Since then he and Annie-Laurie had just been seeing the world , picking up a living by doing odd jobs of work at riversidehouses . Annie-Laurie was his only child . Her mother had died at her birth . She was the living image of her sainted mother . She had had a very good position at a dressmaking establishment , but had thrown it up to look after her father in his illness . This tale , admirably and amusingly related , George swallowed in simple faith after adding a few grains of salt , but Nadine did not believe a word of it . But her unbelief had not prevented her from agreeing whole-I17heartedly with George 's proposal that they should turn their unused coachman 's quarters into a comfortable little flat , suitableas a winter home , and invite Malony and Annie-Laurie to stay with them for always . Whoever they were , she liked and trusted them , and last night she and George had made the proposal , and after one hurried strange glance at each other they had asked if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer as yet . Annie-Laurie had been very quiet all day and Malony had made his jokes with difficulty . Nadine looked at her watch . It was 3:3o . In another hour or so their first real guests would be arriving , for the personal friends who had hitherto stayed with them had hardly counted . But these two , John Adair and his daughter , were strangers . And important strangers too . The familiarity of the name John Adair , when she received his brief business note asking for accommodation for an unlimited period , had sent Nadine to her Who 's Who to find to her dismay that he was what she suspected , John Adair the painter , a wealthy and famous man who would require to be fed as such ; and she still had no cook . And the bath water still showed a tendency to come out of the tap a curious shade of yellow-brown , and not always as hot as might be wished . A crease of anxiety showed between Nadine 's eyebrows as she looked at her watch . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made to Malony and AnnieLauriehad upset them in some way , and that they might perhaps take themselves off just at the moment when they were most urgently wanted . There was a tap at the door . " Come in , " said Nadine . Annie-Laurie entered softly and came and stood by Nadine 's chair . She looked neat and fresh in her flowered overall , but her old-young face looked strained and weary . " Yes , Annie-Laurie ? " asked Nadine . " If you please , Mrs. Eliot , my father and I think it would be best if we were moving on now . " " But , Annie-Laurie , you surely wo n't leave me just when I have guests coming ? " " We 'll stay another week . " I18 " A week 's not long . Mr. and Miss Adair are coming here indefinitely . " " My father says  --  just another week . " " Then you have decided not to accept the General 's offer of staying with us permanently ? " " No . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face Nadine saw it desolate . She pulled forward the little armchair . " Sit down , Annie-Laurie , and let 's talk this over . " " It would be best for us not to stay , " said Annie-Laurie wretchedly , but she sat down . " Listen , Annie-Laurie , " said Nadine . " I am very fond of you . I  --  love you , I think . " She had not known she was going to say that . She was n't the sort of woman who said that sort of thing . She had not even known until she spoke that she did love Annie-Laurie . But it was true . Astonished , bewildered , she put out her hand as though for support against the sun-warmed paneling . And again she had that sensation of a warm and living personality , the personalitythat had prompted her to speak as she had . She looked at Annie-Laurie . The girl 's face was white , and wore again that sealed-in look that had struck Nadine so painfully on the day of her arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is you who have decided against it , " said Nadine . " How did you know that ? " whispered Annie-Laurie . " I felt it , somehow . Why , Annie-Laurie ? I know you are fond of me . " A curious pulsation passed over Annie-Laurie 's sealed face , as when the first breath from the south passes over a frozen world . It passed , but she could not regain the old stillness . She struggled , but Nadine 's warmth had pierced right through her defenses and beneath them the life was painfully quickened . But she did not cry . She pushed her thin hands up into her lovely gold hair and held them there as though she carried in her head a burden too hard to bear ; her eyes seemed dumbly beseechingNadine to deliver her from its weight . " You 'll have to try to tell me a little about yourself , Annie-I19Laurie , " said Nadine gently . " That tale your father told us , the plumbing business and the bathing machines and all that nonsense , I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Irish . Tell me the truth about him . " Annie-Laurie 's hands slipped to her lap . They were tremblingand she clasped them tightly . But Nadine had helped her over the first hurdle and she could speak now . " He was a comedian . He was on the halls , and in pantomime . We did acts together . He sang Irish songs and I sang Scotch ones , and we both danced , and he told funny stories . It got sort of second nature with him to talk Irish . He was an engineer before he went on the halls . 1 ie 's clever . There 's nothing he ca n't do , nothing he does n't seem to know . We made a lot of money at one time . We had  --  everything . " Music-hall artists . Nadine was surprised at herself that she had not guessed that before . Ben , with his usual intuition , had described Malony as a troubadour and had been wiser than she . Their bizarre appearance , vitality , adaptability , and imaginationwere explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odd . " What made your father go on the halls ? " she asked . " He could n't keep his engineering jobs . " " Why not ? " " They did n't satisfy him  --  and then he drinks sometimes , " said Annie-Laurie . Her hands had stopped trembling and her face now was quite expressionless . " But not now , " said Nadine . " Not since we 've been here , " said Annie-Laurie . " Something new , something that interests him , and he 's all right for a bit . But when he gets accustomed to anything  --  " " And that 's why you think you ought not to stay with me ? " asked Nadine gently . " You think he 'd disgrace the Herb of Grace ? " " Not only Jim  --  Father . I would . I 've been in prison . Whereverwe go , whatever we do , it comes out . " The desolation in her voice seemed to open a sort of pit at Nadine 's feet . She was shamed . Women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and yet they dared to find life hard ; they dared to pity themselves because the path they trod was120strewn with pink rose petals when their own choice would have been crimson . She hated herself . Her hatred choked her and she could not speak . " So you see why we must go , " said Annie- Laurie . Nadine took a quick decision . " There 's no need to go , Annie- Laurie , if you would like to stay . " Annie-Laurie stared at her incredulously . " Whatever it was that you did , that is in the past . It is what you are now that matters , and what you are now I trust . I trust you , Annie-Laurie , both you and your father . " Annie-Laurie took a deep breath . " He 's not my father . " Again Nadine put out her hand , as though for support , and again the old woodwork warm in the sun was like the clasp of a reassuring hand . Yet really , she told herself , she ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked . And Annie-Laurie , perhaps , much older . " How old are you , Annie-Laurie ? " she asked . " I do n't look it , but I 'm over thirty , " whispered Annie- Laurie . She was looking at her hands clasped in her lap , her head bent , and Nadine could not see her face . She too looked at Annie-Laurie 's hands . The knuckles were showing white through the sunburned skin . She stretched out her hand and put it over them . " I had to tell you , " said Annie-Laurie . " I had to  --  after you 'd said you trusted me  --  even though  --  " " It 's all right , " said Nadine . " You can still stay if you want to . You do want to , do n't you ? " " Yes , " said Annie-Laurie . " Why ? " asked Nadine . " Because of you . .. and the house . " She looked up at last , her adoration warm in her eyes , but her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak of it . " He stuck to me through it all , " she said . " You ca n't marry him ? " asked Nadine . " It 's not possible , " said Annie-Laurie . " But we 're not , really , doing anything wrong  --  I ca n't explain  --  " " Listen , Annie-Laurie , " said Nadine . " What you have told me is between us . I will not speak of it to anyone  --  not even to my husband . And I will not speak of it to you again , either , but if at any time you would like to tell me more about yourself , 121then I shall be glad to hear it . " She paused , but there was no answer , and Annie-Laurie was looking at her hands again . " For your own sake , not mine . " Annie-Laurie looked up speechlessly , and the light and warmth that had been in her face were gone . She was sealed in again . " Very well , " acquiesced Nadine . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Jim . We do n't want him to start drinking again . " Annie-Laurie stood up , her usual poised and steady self , and smoothed her overall . " I do n't think he will ... not here . " " Is here ' so different from other places ? " " Yes . You 're different . The General and the children and Jill . l le likes you all ... and the house . " " What is it about the house that attracts you so much ? " asked Nadine . " It 's so safe , " said Annie-Laurie . " Seeing it that day from the river  --  well  --  you know what it looks like from the river , towering up above that gray wall . I thought that morning  --  one could be safe there . " " You 're safe here , " said Nadine gently . Annie-Laurie folded her lips tightly and Nadine saw that she was about at the end of her tether . " Run along now , " she said lightly . " Those guests will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Annie-Laurie vanished and Nadine turned at once to her housekeeping books to stave off what she knew was coming . But it was no good . By the time she had added up the butcher 's account the reaction had set in . What on earth had she done ? Well , why ask that ? She knew perfectly well what she had done . She , the respectable wife of a distinguished husband , the mother of five young children , two of them boys at the most impressionable age , had of her own deliberate choice taken into her household a man who at any moment might start drinking , and a girl who had been in prison ; and the relationship between the two of them , though Annie-Laurie had assured her they were doing " nothing wrong , " was , to say the least of it , odd . She put the meat bills aside and tackled the fish , but the fish did n't make her feel any better . She felt cold all over , and was astonished , when she looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been mad , she told herself , stark staring mad . Well , it was too late now . The thing was done and she must abide by it . What on earth would Lucilla say if she knew ? She could not imagine what Lucilla would say ; she only knew that Lucilla must never know . No one must know . She was used to keeping secrets  --  there was David . But how she hated concealments ! They made one feel imprisoned , walled in . Poor Annie-Laurie ! What was walled in there ? The girl was obviously , mentally and nervously , in a bad state , and also afraid , or she would not have spoken as she had about the sense of safety that the house gave her . " Well , you 've done it , " said Nadine to the house . " You pulled them in here to yourself just as you pulled in George and the children . You 've got to defend us all now ... ' from all adversitieswhich may happen to the body , and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' " She realized that she was praying and was astonished at herself , for it was not her habit to pray , and far away , like an answer to her prayer , came the distant chiming of bells . This faint chiming was now one of the special sounds of this place , a part of it , like the slap of the ripples against the river wall , the crying of the gulls , and the beat of the swans ' wings overhead . It came from the bunch of bright bells that hung on the top of the mast on Malony 's boat . Sometimes the wind made them chime , and sometimes Malony tramping about and rocking the boat . The sound was extraordinarily beautiful , and to Nadine at this moment reassuring. 4That was not the last of Nadine 's shocks that afternoon . A mere half hour later there came the sound of a car , and then George 's genial voice raised in welcome . Mary , barking wildly , exploded into a white fountain of fur in her basket . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explode her like a match set to a fuse . " Be quiet , Mary ! " said Nadine , as Mary leaped from her basket , ricocheted across the room , and started bouncing herself back and forth against the door , but she spoke only automatically , for Mary , set off , was like one of those old-fashioned alarm clocks that can not be stoppedI23until they have finished . Nadine took her powder compact and her lipstick from her bag and attended carefully to her face before the mirror . She always refused to be hurried . Hurry was so aging . Then she opened her door , and with Mary bouncing about her passed with her loveliest grace and dignity down the gracious curve of the stairs to greet her guests . They were laughingand talking with George in the bar parlor , now called the hall , where he was shaking cocktails , for a free drink on the house upon arrival was a tradition that George delighted to keep up . The strangers looked up and saw her , and paid her beauty that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so used to that she hardly noticed it . " My wife , " said George , with his customary pride . Oddly enough , it was the girl whom Nadine saw first , and saw with a pang of utterly unreasonable fear , followed immediatelyby a pang of equally unreasonable dislike . For what could there be to fear in this child , or to dislike either ? She looked a thoroughly nice girl , Nadine decided on second thought , and though with her height , her big bones , and her haphazard features she could n't in her hostess ' opinion be called beautiful , her hair and her tawny eyes were lovely . And though she had no style she had her own charm , Nadine thought , as she shook hands with her . In her golden-brown tweeds and honey-combed jumper she looked like some loving , faithful sort of animal , a retriever or a lion cub who had been born without carnivorous propensities . " I hope you 'll be happy here , " she said to the shy , friendly Sally . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sort of  --  set apart . It 's like seeing a picture in an exhibition of some strange shining dream place and stepping over the sill of the frame and finding yourself safe inside it . " Safe . She too used the word safe . What a lovely deep voice she had , a singer 's voice , its charm increased by the Scotch lilt . Yes , she was attractive . " We 've met before , Mrs. Eliot , " said John Adair . Even while she was speaking to Sally she had known that , had been aware in all her quickened senses of his compelling124vitality . Now she turned to him . " In the train once , " she said . " What a coincidence ! " " I 'm no believer in coincidence , " he told her , holding her hand in a warm friendly grasp , his strong ugly face creased with amusement . " And I do n't leave things to chance . " So he had come here because of her . How in the world had he found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her youth she had been used to being the happy quarry of many cheerful huntsmen , and she had played the game of enticement , evasion , and withdrawal with a wicked glee , but the bitter pain of her break with David had left her no heart for love as a game , and her power of attraction had been weakened by her indifference . But now something of the old delight stirred in her again . Her answering laugh had in it the ring of genuine amusement , a ring that had been absent for so long that it positively startled George , and for a moment she looked a girl again . Recovering from the shock George smiled broadly . A little amiable flirtationwould do Nadine as much good as a bottle of tonic . He had no fear of this man . Though George was unaware of the subtleties of character or of situation he could sum up the general layout pretty shrewdly . He recognized in John Adair a man very happily possessed of an exceedingly successful career ; and a successful careerist in the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one purpose , had no use for the damaging emotions , only those that refresh and invigorate . Nadine might think the fellow had fallen for her .... Well , he obviously had , but probably only because he wanted to paint her . Nadine gently withdrew her hand and became the perfect hostess of a guesthouse . " Let 's sit down while we have our cocktails . Then I 'll show you your rooms . In there is the drawing room . Tea will be served presently . It 's so warm I believe you could have it in the garden . We put up tables among the Michaelmas daisies , by the river wall . You are our only guests for a couple of days , and then there are two men coming for a week 's fishing , and some week-end people . We never take more than six guests , though people come and go for meals and drinks . You have come for as long as the Herb of Grace gives satisfaction , have n't you ? " " You see before you two homeless vagabonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat fallen in . CouId n't find another . Furniture stored . " " What about your painting , sir ? " asked George . " I 've kept the studio . The owner of the flat did n't want it . I can go backwards and forwards to Town when I need to . But , as it happens , I 've finished my commissioned portraits and I 'm going to take a bit of a holiday . " " That does n't mean that he 's going to stop painting , " said Sally . " He ca n't . The back of the car is so full up with all his painting things that we could hardly bring any clothes or books . He means that he 's just going to paint what he wants to paint . " John Adair 's eyes went to Nadine 's face and he appeared to be pondering upon it . " And where is he going to paint ? " asked Nadine , with a suspicion of dryness , for his look now as he regarded her had become slightly impersonal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to arrange the goods to the best advantage . " Have you an attic with a north light ? " he asked . " Well , as a matter of fact , we have , " said Nadine , slightly outraged , " but  --  " " Never say but , ' " said John Adair with twinkling eyes . " It is not only one of the ugliest words in the language ; it is also a singularly depressing word , connoting irresolution , and heard upon the lips of those who are halfhearted in their undertakings , unhappy people who never go the whole hog , and with whom I should be most grieved to see you ally yourself .... This is an extremely good drink , General ; you 've gone all out with this cocktail .... Mrs. Eliot , have you an attic with a north light ? " " It 's yours , " laughed Nadine . " I 'd wanted it to store the apples in , but I ca n't have it . " " No , I 'm afraid not . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houseman , will sweep it out . " " Thank you very much . This evening ? I 'd like to settle in as soon as possible . " Yet though his words were brusque , his tone was courteous , and his twinkling eyes upon her were now once more so full 126of animation and delight that she did not resent being stampeded . When one is very tired , she thought , the masterful people who tell you what to do can be very restful . On their way upstairs she showed them the drawing room , which she had now made a place of tranquil beauty . Jt was very simple . She had been lucky enough to get hold of some old green brocade for the curtains , which she had lined with peach color . The armchairs were upholstered in pale green and Lucilla had given her a couple of Persian rugs from Damerosehayfor the floor . There was some old glass on the Adam mantelpiece , plenty of books in a tall glass-fronted bookcase , an old rosewood piano , and bowls of flowers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had not showed it to her , but she had found it in the little room next door where Ben painted when Tommy was not at home to litter it up with his bones , and to please him , for she was full of sorrow just then for her neglect of his cough , she had framed it and hung it in the drawingroom . It showed a herd of red deer racing through a village street at night under the light of the moon .... and leading the red deer was one white one . . . . He had drawn the street from the one at the Hard , and he had got very well the contrast between the peaceful old houses dreaming under the moon and the swift movement of the deer . The flying clouds overhead seemed no swifter in flight than the red deer , and the white one was like a fallen moonbeam ; indeed , the light in the picturecame from him rather than from the moon . But Nadine did not think it was very good ; the anatomy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just one delighted glance around the room John Adair was in front of it . " Who did that ? " he demanded . " Ben , my eldest boy , " said Nadine . " You know , in old days , it was a common occurrence for people in these parts to wake up in the night and hear the deer from the forest galloping down the village street . When he heard it , that captured Ben 's imagination . Also we 've got in the house a funny little stone image of a deer that was dug up in the garden , and that has captured his imagination too . But I 'm afraid the picture is not very good . " " It 's damn good , " said John Adair , almost with violence. 127 " But the drawing  --  " " Faulty , of course , he 's had no teaching . But he 's got it  --  the light . " " Yes , the moonlight is lovely , " said Nadine . John Adair snapped his fingers impatiently , for that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old is this boy ? " he asked . " Sixteen , " said Nadine . " At school , of course ? " " Actually he 's at home just now . He 's net too strong , I 'm afraid . The doctor said he must have a term or two off , and keep out in the air as much as possible . It 's so bad for him , missingschool like this . " " For this boy , probably the best thing possible , " said John Adair , tapping the picture with his finger . " I 'll soon correct the faulty drawing . " " You mean  --  ? " asked Nadine . " We 'll share my studio , your son and I. You , too , of course . I 'm going to paint you for next year 's Academy . " Nadine looked the picture of incredulity . " I 've no time for such nonsense , " she laughed . " You 'll find the time , " he assured her , " and you knew the moment you saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She did not deny it . What was the use ? No conventional insinceritieswould deceive this man . " How did you know where to find me ? " she asked . " That day in the train you dropped a letter headed The Herb of Grace . ' Then when Sally and I were searching for a roof to put over our heads she showed me the advertisement of your inn in some paper or other . I made a few inquiries and heard that General Eliot had an exceedingly beautiful wife . Then I put two and two together . And here I am . " Sally , at the window , had been gloating over the view . Now she gave an incredulous cry of delight . " It 's the twins ! " she cried . John Adair and Nadine joined her at the window and beheld the twins and Jill coming through the garden . " You 're the mother of my children , " she said , turning eagerly to Nadine . " Of the Chevalier , the Pirate , Kate Greenaway , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greengrocer 's shop at Chelsea . " 128 " Was it you who sent me the bunch of violets ? " askedNadine . " Yes , I did . " " Thank you , " said Nadine . " It 's odd , is n't it , that we should be together here ? That is a coincidence , if you like . " They looked at each other , and Nadine saw a tiny shadow of fear in Sally 's eyes . It was gone in a moment , but unmistakable . So Sally was a little bit afraid too , and was probably as unaware of the reason as she was herself . " I say again there 's no coincidence , " said John Adair behind them . " You stepped into a picture , Sally , so you said , when you came into this house . The great masters , no matter how densely populated their canvases , never get a single figure there withoutdeliberate intention . " 129couple of cherubs . They 'd have given a good imitation of anything to go to Knyghtwood . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though they went a good way , they never seemed to have time to go just quite far enough ; she always had to get home to do something or other . And Father and Mother never had time to explore more than just the fringe . And with Ben they never got far enough because he was making a picture of a part of the wood that he liked especially , and as soon as he got there he stuck . But Sally , they felt , being both leisured and inartistic , could be relied on to go right deep in ... right past Ben 's place to the place where the Fairy Person lived . Lessons finished , she took them upstairs to their lovely nursery and put on their stout little walking shoes and their Fair Isle cardigans . They could have done this for themselves , but she loved to do it . She liked the feel of their wriggling little feet in her hands , and the warmth of their bodies in her arms made her feel even gladder than usual that she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much the same feeling as pushing your fingers down into the earth when you were gardening , or having your horse nuzzle the palm of your hand for sugar . Quite suddenly you felt that your life was not an isolated thing , but existed in all other lives , as all other lives existed within yours . There was n't anything anywhere to which you could say , " We do n't need each other . " Taking her arms from around Jose she looked up and her eyes met those of Annie-Laurie , who was making the twins ' beds . In the older girl 's face there was a look of anguish , immediatelyand quickly sealed in again when she saw herself observed . And not only anguish , but something rather like hatred . Sally suddenly felt rather shaky at the knees . Nadine , she knew instinctively , did not really like her , and now it appeared that Annie-Laurie actually hated her . She was not surprisedat Nadine 's dislike , but the hatred did surprise her , and horrified her too , for that glimpse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then her shock , her horror , were forgotten in a surge of compassion . Did Annie-Laurie live in that darkness ? Annie-Laurie was answering her compassion now with a look that said , " I do n't need you . " But that was n't true . They were together in the picture. 131Chapter V I IJoITN ADAIR and Sally had been at the Herb of Grace for a fortnight , though it seemed longer , so much a part of its life had they become , and so quick was Sally at makingherself useful wherever she might happen to be . She liked being useful , especially when it meant minding the twins . This morning she had been aware of a slight atmosphere of strain in the house . The two fishermen were now in residence , and though they were quiet elderly men , absorbed in fish , they nevertheless ate a lot and seemed dissatisfied if fed only upon the fish they caught . And today a relative of General Eliot 's , who had been ill and was visiting Lady Eliot at Damerosehay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no cook .... Sally had already offered to cook for the period of her stay , but Nadine had received this offer a little brusquely ; her pride would not let her accept quite all that much help from a guest . Sally could understand that , and so this morning she had just offered to look after the twins while Nadine cooked and Jill did the children 's washing . Nadine 's pride permitted Sally the flowers , minding the twins , and exercising Mary , for these were holiday employments that took her out of doors . And she loved the twins . It was convenientfor a woman to be born as naturally selfless and maternalas was Sally , thought Nadine . She would make a good wife and mother with very little effort on her part . Sally gave the twins their morning lessons in the drawing room first . They did not like acquiring information and generallybehaved like demons in the process , but she promised them that if they were good they should take her afterwards a long way inside the wood , whose real name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they gave quite a good imitation of a130 " Annie-Laurie , will you show me your houseboat one day ? " she asked . " There 's nothing to see , " said Annie-Laurie curtly . " Please , " said Sally . " It 's our private little home , my father 's and mine . Not even Mrs. Eliot has seen it . " The rudeness of this hurt too much for Sally to be able to find any answer . She smiled , her face surprised yet humbly patient , like that of a child when it is hurt , collected the twins , and went downstairs to find Mary and her mackintosh and boots . The care of a snow white Pekinese in the country was , Nadine had discovered , no sinecure . She had become so tired of having to wash Mary every time she had been in Knyghtwoodthat she had now made her four little mackintosh top boots , and a curious mackintosh garment that protected her furry undercarriage and tied with bows on top of her back . Mary detested these garments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into them , her rumbles accompanied by a flash in the eye which led everyone to feel it was just as well that they could not understand what she said. 2The party of four set out . The cat Smith came a little way with them , treading with delicate precision and swinging a slow , rhythmical tail , but not too far , for he was urban-minded and not really at home in Knyghtwood . Sally had so far explored only the fringes of it and she was almost as excited as the children . " With Jill we 've been as far as the big oak , " said Jerry . " And with Ben we 've been as far as his special place , where the Person is who plays the pipes , but with you we 're going right deep into the Place Beyond where the Fairy Person with the Horns is . " Sally was interested . They had probably got Pan playing his pipes out of The Wind in the Willows ; Ben had made himself a little pipe and played it in the wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see and laugh at him , and they had perhaps heard his music , but where did the Place Beyond come from , and who was the Person with the Horns ? 132 " Who is this Fairy Person ? " she asked . " We saw his pointy face looking at us out of the wood that first day we came , " said Jose . " We could n't see more of him because he was hiding in a holly tree . Then he went away and we have n't seen him again . We want to . " " What 's the Place Beyond ? " asked Sally . " What the other places are n't , " said Jerry , a little impatient with her stupidity . " But how will you know it when you get there ? " persisted the obtuse Sally . " I mean , there are so many places that are n't what other places are . " The twins looked at her pityingly . " Because it is n't many places ; it 's one place . It 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her at the wood . It was , she thought , the loveliest wood she had ever seen , and full of deep peace . The woods across the river were beech woods , but this was chiefly birch and alder , with willows growing next the water , and brambles and crab apples , wild cherry and stunted oaks growing up the inland slope . The willow shoots were wands of gold , the birches and oaks silver , the brambles gemmed with bright leaves , the mosses and lichens saffron and coral and jade . The river to their left showed only as a suffusion of silver light , while overhead the patterning of branches against the sky cut from the immensity fragments and patches of blue that yet seemed each of them to hold something of the glory of the whole . There were small stirrings of unseen wild things going about their business in the undergrowth , and the rustle of wings , but the sound seemed only to intensify the deep stillness . Such autumn days have a holiness that spring lacks , thought Sally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has lost its terror . Jerry and Jose were now Rat and Mole . They ran along making little squeaking noises , and dropping now and then to all fours . Mary was the spirit of all her hunting ancestors fused into a white flash of speeding light ; she was here , there , and everywhere , hot upon exciting rabbit scents . Sally strode along with her hands deep in the pockets of her golden-brown tweed coat , her chestnut head gleaming , her face a little flushed with her joy . The hurt that Annie-Laurie had dealt her , together133with all things of darkness , she had left behind at the green gate . The air of this wood , clean and sweet though it was to breathe , was yet somehow resistant , woven of some sort of heavenly loveliness that could not be interpenetrated by anything that was contrary to its nature . The Herb of Grace gave one a sense of defense against all that might happen to the body , but here one felt defended from all evil thoughts which might assault and hurt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrase came to her . " The armor of the house of the forest . " That was what the early Christians had called it when they fled there to find safety from persecution . And yet , according to the twins , it was only the courtyard ; there was a Place Beyond . Mary suddenly swerved away uphill to the right , Rat and Mole after her . Sally took her hands out of her pockets and ran after them . At the top of a grassy bank there grew an oak tree , a splendid old giant to whom one must obviously pay one 's respects before one passed any further , for he dominated this bit of the wood in a very kingly way . Standing in a group together Sally and the twins and Mary did homage . Just as they were turning away again Sally 's eye was caught by some narrow green leaves growing at the foot of the oak . " Look ! " she said . " They 're like the leaves on the inn signboard . Is it the herb of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jose . " Ben said so . Rue . Herb of grace o ' Sundays . But it has n't any flowers . " " It 'll have them when the spring comes , " said Sally , and she touched the leaves gently with her finger tips . Then she picked a spray of leaves and put it in her buttonhole . They ran down the bank and went on , and the enchantment and silence of the wood was threaded through by the sound of running water . Presently they came to it , a stream that ran down through the woods towards the river . The water was amber in the sunlight , red-brown in the shade , tinged with iron , but crystal clear so that one could see all the pebbles on the bottom . The stream was a wide one and in the center of it was an island fringed with loosestrife and bog myrtle , with a clump of thorn trees and sloes in the center of it . It was reached by a bridge made from the fallen branch of a tree overgrown with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island , lighting up the grape-dark sloes , the tiny ruby berries on the thorns , drawing up the scent of the bog myrtle and wet ferns . " It 's Brockis Island , " said Jose . " Brockis means badger , Jill says . This is Ben 's special place . He 's painting it . He says Pan comes here . And one day we heard pipes , we did , really . " " Pan has horns too , " said Jerry . " But not such nice horns as the Fairy Person 's . " " Ben put the bridge there , " said Jose , " so that we should not get wet going to the island . We think no one knows about the island except us . " They crossed the stream , pushed their way through the bushes upon the further side , and found themselves facing a small natural archway made by two old thorn trees leaning towards each other . The archway was just the right size for children , and Sally had hard work to get through it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for inside was a small perfect green lawn so thickly surrounded by the trees that one could see nothing through them , and with the berry-jeweled branches arching overhead to make a roof . It was a sweet and secret place , a perfect little house for children . The sunlight striking through the roof overhead gave to every leaf and every blade of grass something of itself to treasure in a green loving cup , or hold triumphantly erect upon a spear point . Beautiful as it was now , shining and jeweled , Sally thought it would be even more so in the spring , when the primroses were out and the fruit blossom made a pink-and-white roof against the sky . " Look ! " said Jerry pointing . Between the roots of an old thorn tree , veiled by bracken fronds of palest gold , was the entrance to someone 's home . Mary , barking wildly , charged up to it as though she meant to leap down inside , but at the doorstep halted , spun around in a furry flurry , and subsided with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevated , well-braced legs , and trembling tail . Rat and Mole dropped to all fours and Sally sat back on her heels , looking with shining eyes at the badger 's holt . " He 's stripy , " said Jerry , " with whiskers. " 134 135 " Ben 's seen him , " said Jose . " Once when he was here by himself . " " Dear Ben , " said Sally . " Look ! The herb of grace is growinghere too ; just one root of it beside Badger 's front door . " Jose put her paws over her snout and squeaked . " Come out , Badger ! " she called . " Come out and play with us . " But Jerry dealt firmly with her . " Stop that , Jose ! If we play at Rat and Mole and Badger we 'll be here all the morning , and never get Beyond . " He seized a fallen bit of wood , flung a leg over it , galloped once around the green lawn , neighing loudly , and proceeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jose , quick as lightning , copied him , and Sally , dashing after them and seizing them by their disappearing tails , was only just in time to prevent their plunging into the stream on the other side of the island , where there was no bridge . " I 'm your horse , " she said . " A mighty war horse . You 'll cross this rushing river one by one upon my back . " This was a good idea . Sally , a hardy creature who never caught cold , took off her shoes and stockings and waded across with them , carrying Mary in her arms upon the second crossing . Then she sat down upon the further bank , dried her feet with her handkerchief , and put on her shoes and stockings again . When she looked up they had all three disappeared . Of course . They were knights on horseback now . They would go fast. 31The narrow path through the wood that they had followed had ended at Brockis Island . There was no track through this part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sally walked on , keeping the gleam of water upon her left . She did not feel anxious ; , she 'd be sure to come upon the twins sooner or later . And it as good to be alone for a little with this beauty . She saw some wonderful things as she walked : a stick jeweled with scarlet moss cups , a jay 's feather lying on a cushion of green moss , a cloud of goldfinches tossing above a clump of thistles . And as the shade deepened so did the mystery of this place , and the sense of holiness that was the autumn's136gift . Her heart beat a little quicker . ... Surely she was coming to somewhere . There was a brighter gleam of sunshine and she came to a clearing in the wood . She shut her eyes for a moment , dazzled , and opened them upon the landscape of a vision or a dream , the same landscape that she had remembered from some picture when she had first seen Ben . Only now it was not a vague elusive memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinct picture . A second , smaller stream ran through this clearing , seeping silently through a wide bed of smooth-rolled pebbles . The bog myrtle grew here too , robed in silver light , beautifully massed against the deep shade of the wood beyond . She saw the shapes of many birds all about her : swans upon the river to her left , a heron in flight , small birds singing in the branches ; and she saw the animals clearly too , a rabbit , a bear , deer , many dogs , one of them very old and bowing his head as though in reverence . And there upon his great white horse was the chevalier , the sunlight gleaming upon his huntinghorn and the rich colors of the silk and fur that clothed him , and he was gazing with a rapt face at something which he saw and she could not see . But his face was not Ben 's face this time ; it was a fair face with clear-cut features , the face of a much older man . The color , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any longer . Against her will her mortal eyes closed , and when she opened them again the scene was of this earth . Yet there were birds still ; she saw a swan upon the water and heard the cry of the sea gulls . And two dogs were still there : a funny old mongrel like a gray woolly hearthrug , and a majestic and incomparable chow . And the chevalier was still there , gazing with that deep absorption at something that was clear to him but hidden from her . But the great white horse , the hunting horn , the garments of silk and fur , had vanished . He was a man of this century on foot in the woods . But his face was the same , and she had always known it . Though she did not move he was aware of her and turned round . His eyes looked dazed for a moment , and then puzzled recognition dawned in them . " Have n't we seen each other beforesomewhere ? " he asked 137She came forward , her hands in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unself-conscious absorption of a trustful child . " Yes , at a party in London . I 'm Sally Adair . My father and I are staying at the Herb of Grace . I knew a relation was coming to lunch but I did n't know he was you . " " And I knew John Adair and his daughter were guests at the Herb of Grace , but I did n't know the daughter was Sally the shepherdess . . .. Why , the old Bastard likes you ! " The chow , gazing at her with imperial consideration , had not yet made up his mind about her , but the Bastard was leaninghis old head against her knee . She caressed his rough fur . " He 's the one who 's just the same , " she murmured . " The one who had bowed his head and was worshiping . " David looked puzzled , as well he might . " The sunlight got in my eyes and I saw a strange picture , " she explained . " A picture of all sorts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees the oddest things in woods , " agreed David . " What were you seeing ? " asked Sally . " Nothing out of the ordinary . Just a kingfisher . Though actually a kingfisher is a bit out of the ordinary , is n't he ? A heavenly bird . " " What we ought to be seeing , " said Sally , " are the twins and Mary . I brought them out for a walk and now I 've lost them . " " Those twins ! " said David with sympathy . " Many 's the time I 've lost them . If they turn into anything that gets a pace on , like a speedboat or a motor bike , it 's all up . " " They were knights on horseback , " said Sally . " Not so bad as a speedboat , " said David cheerfully . " I suggestthat if we tramp on to the edge of the wood , where I 've left my car , singing Gaily the Troubadour , ' they might think the time had come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Troubadour , ' by the way ? Grandmother brought us up on all those old songs , Clementine , ' and Wrap Me Up in My Tarpaulin Jacket , ' and the rest . " " Of course I know them , " said Sally . " My Scotch nanny sang them all to me when I was little . " And as they swung inland and began to climb up the slope of the wood , the two old dogs at their heels , her deep contralto voice rang out in the air of138 " The Troubadour . " David was silent for a moment , astonished at the loveliness of her untrained voice , and then he joined in . Another couple might have felt themselves ridiculous , singing the sentimental old ballad together at the tops of their voices , but neither Sally nor David suffered from self-consciousness . They tramped on singing through waist-high bracken , until the trees thinned and they came out into a narrow winding lane , high up on the brow of a hill , with a beautiful patchwork of pasture and shorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of the Estuary , with the Island opal-tinted and celestial beyond . David 's silvery gray car waited at the edge of the wood , but there was no sign of the twins . " You 'd have thought the row we made would have fetched them , would n't you ? " said David . " I suppose the Place Beyond was not that lovely hollow where we met each other , but beyond again , " said Sally , and she explained about the twins and the Fairy Person whom they expected to find in the place that is not what other places are because it is the one place , in the middle . " Like the hub of a wheel , " said David , opening the door of his car . " Sounds very deep . And I should n't like to intrude on the twins in the place  --  if they 've found it . We 'll sit and talk in the car and every now and then make a noise like an air-raid siren to let them know where we are . Jerry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my acquaintance who does . " " What is the wood like beyond the hollow ? " asked Sally , as they settled themselves in the front of the car with the two old dogs comfortably installed at the back . David laughed . " I ca n't tell you . I do n't know this wood . " Then he looked at her teasingly . " I believe you 're taking this mysterious place of the twins quite seriously . You 're disappointedbecause you did n't get there , are n't you ? " Sally flushed , but she did not deny the charge . " Yes , I am , " she said stoutly . " Though if I 'd got there I do n't suppose I 'd have seen whatever it is the twins are seeing . Children have vision . " " Imagination , " amended David . " It 's the same thing , " said Sally . " Not quite , I think . Imagination comes from yourself                 @ @ @ @
