For the Nazis , it was too easy . They dispensed with the usual excuses , and announced to the occupied Grand Duchy of Luxembourg that it was the first country to be honored with annexation to the Third Reich since the shooting started . Incidentally , they said , Luxembourg men would be drafted into the German Army . <P> In front of the blast furnaces at Schifflange , men paused to talk . Somebody turned off the blowers that forced the drafts into the fires . The strike was on . The German-controlled newspaper , Nationalblatt , called the strikers " enemy agents . " <P> The German Gauleiter , Gustav Simon , was quick to discipline the new citizens of the Reich . He declared a state of civil emergency , established military courts with powers to sentence strikers to immediate death . Luxembourgers should remember , he intimated , that workers in the New Order do not strike . <P> Luxembourgers remembered , instead , the years before the war , when personal savings bulged in the banks and in the farmhouse mattresses ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voted ; when Luxembourgers could call their souls their own . <P> While firing squads went to work , the furnace chimneys of southwest Luxembourg grew cold , the smoky " black country " grew bright again . Work stopped in steel mills . The strike spread countrywide . <P> Through the Nazi 's solid wall of censorship word seeped last week to London that the strike kept on . And there were stories of sabotage . Fine sand , mixed somehow into lubricating oil , was scarring the bearings of Luxembourg 's railroad engines . Railway signals misbehaved ; the transport system went awry . <P> This week **42;9259;TOOLONG of Walram , Grand Duchess of Luxembourg , said : " My heart breaks for them the strikers because I know hundreds will allow themselves to be shot rather than go back to work . " <P> Nobody knew whether or not the Nazis preferred discipline to industrial output , shooting strikers to running rivers of steel . Nobody knew whether the strikes would spread . If the puniest child could be so stubborn , what would the big brothers do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
