The Detroit Symphony Orchestra 's President Henry H. Reichhold had threatened his rebellious musicians with a good ' ' house cleaning , " if they did n't behave ( TIME , Feb. 14 ) . Last week , most of Detroit 's musicians were wondering if Reichhold had already gotten out his broom . <P> One thing was sure : all of the orchestra 's 90 players had been fired . But , said both Orchestra Personnel Manager Karl Chase and Union President Jack Ferentz , that was just a routine matter . Under their complicated agreement , as long as no master contract had been signed for next season , the orchestra was obliged to make all the musicians free agents . That gave the men a chance to find new jobs if they wanted to , and the orchestra a chance to make replacements . The joker : in the past , the musicians had been warned in advance that the firing was a mere formality . Last week , on this point , President Reichhold was silent .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
