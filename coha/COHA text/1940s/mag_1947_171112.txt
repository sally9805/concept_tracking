Never before had the French Communists appeared so defiant , so malicious , so isolated and so hell-bent for chaos . There was symptomatic violence in the Assembly chamber , and real violence , bloody , ugly and portentous , in the streets . <P> In the chamber , Communist Jacques Duclos reached new highs of invective . When he attacked U.S. aid to France , he was jeered and booed by voices from all the non-Communist benches . Comrade Duclos yelled that Premier Ramadier " wanted to obtain thanks from Washington by taking to your masters there the death certificate of French Communism . " <P> Ramadier , caught between Communist intransigence and the rising strength of Charles de Gaulle , asked for a vote of confidence . The opposition came mainly from the Communists and the far Right . The Socialists and Popular Republicans voted solidly for Ramadier , and a sprinkle of votes from other parties enabled him to squeak through , by 300-to-280 . He had gained a little time ; the darkening situation made it seem desperately little . <P> If there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an opening skirmish one night around the Place de 1'Etoile , in which stands the Arch of Triumph . At 9 p.m. in the Salle Wiagram an organization called " The League for the Rights of Peoples Oppressed by the Soviets " had scheduled a rally at which Polish , Rumanian , Hungarian , Bulgarian and Yugoslav refugees would tell what things were like under the Stalinist boot . That morning the Communist paper L'Humanit had summoned the faithful to break up the meeting . " Everyone to the Wagram tonight at 7 ! Silence to the insulters of the Soviet Union ! The way to prevent the meeting is to get there first . " <P> A Delicate Question . Forewarned of trouble . TIME Correspondent Andr Laguerre got there early . He cabled : <P> A swollen orange moon , hanging low in the sky like a Chinese lantern , peered fitfully through the clammy fog . It was a raw night , and Parisians pulled their coats tightly around them as they hurried back to unheated homes . Beside me , huddled in muffler and tattered topcoat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stool and hawked his roast chestnuts . <P> " Chauds , les Matrons , chauds ! " <P> After ignoring a police order to clear out before trouble started , Anatole and I discussed the affairs of France . He was pessimistic but philosophical . " The Communists are going to make trouble in France , " he said . " They are not all a bad lot , but they are not intelligent . Their leaders are dirty types . Well , if we are going ; to have a ' coup dur ' we can take it ; we have seen others . <P> " De Gaulle is a great Frenchman , but he means trouble . De Gaulle always means trouble for France . I do n't know if he makes trouble , or if he is just there when trouble comes . It is a delicate question . Tonight we shall have some trouble . But I am not going home until I have sold my chestnuts . " <P> At 6 o'clock the police began to arrive . Between 6 and 8 , trucks brought 3,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and khaki-clad Gardes Mobiles in steel helmets , carrying rifles . Nearby subway stations were closed and guarded by groups of cops from the Service d'Ordre , the dreaded riot squad of the Prefecture of Police ; under their capes they hid Tommy guns .
