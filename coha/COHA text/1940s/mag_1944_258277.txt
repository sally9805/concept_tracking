Home again after a second tour of the world 's battlefronts , Dr. Daniel A. Poling , president of the World 's Christian Endeavor Union and editor of the Christian Herald , wrote for TIME the following report on the state of religion as he found it among the armed forces : <P> War is not a prayer meeting , and global war gives men little time to sing hymns in front of an altar . But the praying pilot ; the nurse who lifted the cup of cold water to my burning lips ; the mail truck driver with a chest cough that sounded to me like pneumonia , who nevertheless drove twelve miles out of his way to get a lost kid from Georgia back to his outfit ; the girl from Oregon who was hanging curtains at a dust-smothered " basha " to make it look a bit like home to homesick boys ; and the wounded from the landing beaches of Italy who , after the general had decorated 22 of their comrades , sang God Bless America , will stand forever on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met . <P> The Real Peacemakers . If religious leaders on the home front are to make out of this war a new occasion for the Christian Church , they must be able to hear these deeper tones and to feel the pulse of character that beats beneath the surface . War is to American youths an unnatural , dirty , desperate business . The glory that artists once painted , and of which the poets once sang , is departed . War does things to the finer sensibilities . Let it be damned forever . But make no mistake : these men have the sense of mission and will return to help make a decent peace . They believe themselves to be right now the real peacemakers , as I believe they are . They fight to keep America free , and they know it-and to keep war forever away from their children . They want no part in any imperialism . But they are not isolationists . They are realists . They believe that since we could not stay out of the war we are fools if we try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that , to keep freedom and peace for ourselves , we must help make freedom and peace available to others . Yes , there is no glory in war any more , but there is a deathless glory in lives poured into causes as holy as these . Here is religion , the religion that I find at the front . <P> What of the Church ? But what does the serviceman think about the church at home , and about me , the churchman-that is the real question . <P> A young officer from New England looked at me ironically and asked : " What kind of a world do you preachers live in ? Not this world , " and he swung his hand toward the beds of an army hospital ward . " You talk about peace . Fine . Keep on talking , but why not talk a little about this war that a good many of us are fighting so that you can keep on talking ? Not a line from the churches have I read yet about the necessity of winning the war-first . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we live that we ca n't hear you . . . . "
