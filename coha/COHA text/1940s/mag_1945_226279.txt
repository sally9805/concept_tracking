For nearly two years the small ( circ. 230,000 ) city - slicker New Yorker and the mighty , midget-sized Reader 's Digest ( circ. 11,000,000 ) have been on the outs . In a frigidly phrased communiqu to his contributors in February 1944 , wire-haired Harold W. Ross , terrier-tempered editor of the New Yorker , served notice that his magazine was through being Digested . <P> The thing that had made irritable Editor Ross blow his top was the discovery that the Digest was no longer a digest , that many of its articles were home-grown in its own commodious nursery at Pleasantville , N.Y . and " planted " in other publications- for eventual transplanting back to the Digest . Said Ross : " This gives us the creeps . . . . " <P> Last week the New Yorker was deep in a lengthy , serial exploration of this creepy process . A composite " profile " of the Digest and tall , lean DeWitt Wallace , its editor and co-owner , had already run to three dart-throwing installments and 14,000 words . How much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Bainbridge , the 32-year-old author , said there was only a thin chance that it would break the six-installment record devoted to another Ross anathema , Walter Winchell . <P> Staffer Bainbridge had grubbed away for two years on the series , had traveled to Detroit , Washington , Chicago and St. Paul ( Wallace 's home town ) for background . About the only new , or little known , facts , the New Yorker has dredged up , to date : <P> DeWitt Wallace was born Nov. 12 , 1889 . ( Digest editors , who had wondered how old the boss was , were glad to have that settled . ) <P> The publisher of the anti-nicotine Digest " is a backslider who gets away with a couple of packs a day . " <P> His hired hands and contributors find him and his favor unpredictable . Once Wallace gave an elderly employee the silent treatment for months-and then , in a sudden change of mood , gave him a twelve-room house for Christmas . <P> From sales of the adless Digest Wallace " nets about 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . " He pays his favorites hugely : Executive Editor Kenneth W. Payne got $1 million over 10 years . <P> For reprint rights ( it now has contracts with " some 40 " periodicals ) , Reader 's Digest pays as little as $1,200 a year ( to the New Republic ) , as much as $50,000 ( to Crowell-Collier and Curtis Publishing Cos . ) . Authors who get reprinted are paid $150 per Digest page . <P> Three out of five articles now originate in the Digest 's offices and appear as originals or as reprints after " planting " elsewhere . Usually they are given away ; often they take a lot of peddling . <P> One such planted Digest " condensation " ran 468 words longer than the article ( in the Nation ) it condensed . <P> The New Yorker series had started out briskly enough ; by instalment No. 3 it seemed like a rambling candidate for the New Yorker 's own " Infatuation with Sound of Own Words Department . " It had not been as stiletto-sharp as many " profiles " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have preferred it condensed . But it was safe to assume that the Digest would not do it for them .
