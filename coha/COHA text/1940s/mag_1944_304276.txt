Finland 's craggy , 78-year-old Jean Sibelius was interviewed early this month , at his villa north of Helsinki , by LIFE Photographer Eliot Elisofon . His report : <P> " Age had emphasized every line and bump of his skull structure . He wore a double-breasted blue suit , black shoes , a starched shirt whose collar was easily three sizes too large , revealing a wrinkled neck . I counted six furrows between his eyebrows . <P> " The first thing I did was hand him two long Coronas , which I excavated in Helsinki . His eyes sparkled and he grabbed me with both arms , saying ' Cigars from America , cigars from America .

The glass never came . He said he had one bottle of whiskey left , but was saving it .

He walked in the woods and sat on a bench near a stone wall . <P> " Sibelius told me he listens frequently to the radio and so keeps in touch with current music . ' I heard the Leningrad Symphony and I feel Shostakovich has very great talent , ' he said . <P> " One subject he declined to discuss was his own recent work .

' <P> " He said , ' If I were only younger ! ' "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
