txt Channel Islands Interest Us Some of Our History Originated in the Occupied Territory To THE EDITOR OF TAN New Yong TIMES t With deep sorrow I read in THE TIMES that the tragedies of war have come to the Channel Islands . Those who , like myself , have lived in those islands , have ' firmly implanted in their memories a picture of a hard-working , intelligent people of simple tastes , desiring above all things to live at peace with the rest of mankind . During the last war the Channel Islanders voluntarily gave up their ancient right of exemption from military service to such an extent that few men of military age were not in active service . Their casualties were enormous , and the cost in money and resources staggering , but every man , woman and child did his duty gladly and proudly . It was Jersey 's protection of King Charles II while his country was in the throes of revolution which resulted in that monarch 's giving New Jersey to Sir George Carteret , the island Governor . A Guernseyman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island during Napoleonic times , came to America and with his followers founded Guernsey County , Ohio . But the United States has reason to feel obligated to the islands for a far more important reason . All the Guernsey and Jersey cattle in our country , now numbering millions , are descended from original stock brought over during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries , the Jerseys from the island of that name and the Guernseys from Guernsey , Alderney and Sark . The island herds , kept intact for nearly a thousands years , have been dispersed during the past two weeks . At a time when refugees from wartorn Europe are seeking refuge in our country , an especial welcome should be given to Channel Islanders , a sturdy , independent people who in their characteristics closely resemble the best of the early settlers in America . ALFRED S. CAMPBELL . Lambertville , N. J. , June 29 , 1940 . Appeal for Transportation To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I was very much moved by your editorial , in which you speak of the urgent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in France . It is true that to fail to act now would be entirely contrary to the American spirit . I believe the Spanish refugees and the international volunteers are in particularly serious danger , for the link between Hitler , Mussolini and Franco is known to be very close . Luckily some of the Latin American governments have offered asylum to these people . Our government should at the very least provide the necessary transportation and diplomatic protection . HELEN L. SIMON . New York , June 28. 1940 . Red Tape Untangled To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your readers have been made aware of the red tape involved in visas for British children who have been offered homes in this country . They will be pleased to know that all that red tape has been cut . It is only necessary for Americans now to cable to the American Embassy in London a brief statement accepting responsibility for the maintenance and custody of the child and guaranteeing that he or she will not become a public charge while in this country , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's financial condition . If these statements are found satisfactory and there are no other reasons for barring the child , the State Department asserts the visa will be issued . Prompt action by the department in solving this urgent problem will be greatly appreciated by those seeking children and by British parents of children who are now in danger . H. A. L. New York , June 29 , 1940 . Lack of Weapons Deplored Present Plight of Army Laid to Inertia in Administration Circles To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your editorial , " Military Fundamentals , " is full of sound sense , and sharpens the point of the official critique of the recent manoeuvres of the Regular Army . We have long been indifferent to the danger of having an army much too content to mark time on the smooth beaten path of old methods and much too old weapons . You point out the new and greater danger of putting new weapons into the hands of officers and men unfamiliar with their use and illprepared to turn to modern methods of warfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our military forces  --  for the few regular divisions which have received very recently their quota of new weapons and mechanized equipment . The National Guard is still waiting for its quotas ; and it is now apparent that most of the materiel needed to fill the shortages has still to be manufactured . These shortages were broadcast rather loudly by higher officers of the Army after the Plattsburg manoeuvres of 1939 , but no disclosure of the facts , no appeals , no reminders , have availed against the inertia of an administration absorbed in its resounding verbal protests against the course of a world catastrophe . In a letter to THE TIMES some weeks ago General Haskell itemized in a few brief lines the pathetic trickle of new equipment received by the New York National Guard since these shortages were made public ten months ago . At the present time , the New York National Guard has two tanks . It has not a single anti-tank weapon of any kind ; not a single .50-caliber machinegun ; no 81-mm. mortars ; no 60-mm. mortars although its infantry has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these particular and non-existent weapons . It has eighteen 3-inch anti-aircraft guns , but no 37-mm. guns , or .50-caliber machine-guns for use against strafing airplanes . All other National Guard divisions are in a corresponding state of disarmament : new materiel is doled out by the War Department pro rata , so that among them all the shortages are intpartially equal . Although the horse halo been eliminated in principle , the neces ? sary motorized equipment has not been provided . High mobility is the order of the day among European armies : the American way in military affairs is evidently to mean an unarmed body of troops made safe by total immobility . The President has already asked for authority to call the National Guard into service . If any emergency arises it will have to be called out at once  --  willr. nilly . The Regular Army alone can not provide for even the beginnings of hemisphere defense . The Guard divisions thus called out will lack nearly all the new types of arms and materiel neces sary today . They will be practically without tanks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons for defending itself against the attacks of enemy tanks or aircraft . There is no prospect , or possibility even , of these gaps being filled in the near future . Is " hemisphere defense , " to prove in reality , no more than another " bolonet dollar ? " T. H. THOMAS . Cambridge , Mass. , June 29 , 1940 . Banks Cool to Large Deposit New Deal Policies Blamed for Diffio culty in Placing Estate Funds To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMM ' Yesterday I went through purgatory under circumstances that will sound almost unbelievable . I was trying to deposit $15,000 in estate funds in New York City banks . I knew that the savings banks were restricting new accounts . I telephoned to twenty banks and trust companies and learned to my dismay that some of them would accept only new accounts amounting to $250 , some would accept $1,000 and others $2,000 . It took a whole day to finally deposit the $15,000 in several banking institutions . One trust company told me that they had forty million dollars of idle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accept any new deposits . Is it any wonder , then , that the depression continues through all these years and the rolls of the unemployed remain at a fixed level ? Billions of dollars are lying idle in the banks of this country and investors are afraid to enter into any new ventures and risk their money as long as the present Administration continues in Washington . This is the reason why many of our citizens are turning away with disgust from the New Deal . A new Administration in Washington , I feel , will bring about a great change , . The Republican party has a grand opportunity and all Republicans should forget their defeatist attitude and restore the party to its old-time dominance . Louis A. STONE . New York , June 29 , 1940 . Guilty Plea Held Cheaper To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK Timm ' In answering a summons in the traffic courts of New York , the way of the transgressor is easy , but the way of the innocent is hard . If you wish to plead guilty every consideration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - with money for a fine . The clerk calls your name , you pay the fine and get a receipt . Time consumed , one-half hour . Cost , $2 or $3 . If you are innocent , however , the way is long and weary . You go to court , wait three or four hours until your case is called . You plead not guilty . A trial date is set to permit the policeman who issued the summons to appear . Lawyers , witnesses , expense , . loss of time from business ensue . Only the very foolish plead not guilty . Once a summons has been issued , yon can not avoid the procedure , even though the precinct captain admits an error was made and that you are innocent , The Chief Magistrate claims to have no jurisdiction . If you find a summons tied to the door of your car . just par the fine , or you will be punished . HAROLD ARNOLD . New York . June 26 , 1940 . Congress Is Chided To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servants a bit of good , clean fun , and the spectacle of the thousand delegates solemnly assembled to debate the relative merits of citizens for office furnishes a comic Interlude for our overworked Congressmen . But these are not ordinary circumstances . Congress leaves us without a Secretary of the Navy until it can give Mr. Knox the third degree . It holds up the urgently needed supplies for Great Britain until it can pass on the matter . And it goes off to Philadelphia for the week . That is not a long time , but a great deal can happen in a week . A great deal did happen last week . It Is unbearable that the country should be left in this emergency with a President whose hands are tied . If Congress wants to be a responsible governing body , then . let it stay in session . If it wants to go on holidays , then let it stop trying to hamper the President . Voters have short memories and the courage of rabbits .

Business Assets Ignored To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Courtesy , politeness , consideration , thoughtfulness , respect for elders  --  what do today 's graduates know about those valuable assets for success ? Five aged gentlemen stood talking in the office of a Social Security Bureau for a half to three-quarters of an hour . They were standing because the few chairs in the waiting room were preempted by healthy young graduates waiting for their new cards . Standees also included a few elderly ladies , also undoubtedly weary . The elderly men contemplated retiring on pensions and so leaving openings for some of these same youngsters . The writer , an executive of over forty years ' experience , wonders if personnel managers could n't acquire some interesting viewpoints by visiting their local bureaus . H. CHAPELL . Weehawken , N.
