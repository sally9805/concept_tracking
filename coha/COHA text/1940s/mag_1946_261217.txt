On one day last week there were 40 strikes going on in New York City . One of them had New Yorkers jittery ; it threatened to take a major bite out of their food supplies and to cut off their newspapers , cigarets , soap , candy bars and hundreds of the items they purchase daily over store counters . Unless it ended soon , it would throw hundreds of thousands out of jobs . <P> The strikers were about 12,000 A.F.L. truck drivers who work for general hauling contractors . Out in sympathy were some 15,000 drivers in nearby New Jersey cities . The issue : a demand for a 30% pay increase ( present scale : $8.45 to $11.63 a day ) . <P> <P> The walkout immediately blocked some 5,000 long-distance trucks which daily rumble into the metropolitan area with much of the city 's food , manufacturing and mercantile supplies . Strike leaders promised to keep food and essential drug supplies moving , but in many cases drivers refused to haul food to chain stores , most of whose shelves were almost empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many industries , including the immense garment and printing trades , air-braked to a creep by lack of supplies and glutted by unmovable finished products , served notice of shutdowns if the tieup continued . Mayor William O'Dwyer stepped in with a settlement proposal- the magic 18-an-hour raise . But the drivers , against the urgings of their union leaders , tossed it back to him as unacceptable . <P> New Yorkers had suffered since V-J day from elevator tieups , two tugboat strikes that periled fuel and power supplies ( see above ) , a war of nerves over a subway standstill , and now this . They had learned two things:1 ) how easily one union can put the brakes on the Big Town ; 2 ) there was nothing they could do about it .
