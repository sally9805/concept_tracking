Last year a group of eminent scientists , most of whom would rather drink cocktails than tea , banded together to wrest the U. S. Drunkard from the hands of the temperance movement . Bolstered by grants from several learned societies , the Research Council on Problems of Alcohol , under the leadership of Dr. Winfred Overholser of Washington 's St. Elizabeth 's Hospital , set projects stirring in a half-dozen U. S. universities . Members tackled such problems as the Drunkard 's liver , stomach , love for his mother . <P> Last week the Council issued Volume I , No. 1 of the Quarterly Journal of Studies on Alcohol . A compendium of scientific fact and fancy , the Journal offered no clear-cut conclusions on the cause &; cure of alcoholism , left the lay reader with the sobering impression that a man staggering down the street is a dark scientific mystery . <P> High Proof . Yale 's Physiologist Yandell Henderson has his own ideas about alcoholism . Because drunkards thrive on hard liquor , always drink it straight , Dr. Henderson wants to dilute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on high-proof whiskey , * low taxes on low-proof . He even advocated that watered-down , 60 proof liquor be legalized . " Consumers of spirits , " said Dr. Henderson , would probably " support the experiment " by drinking such cheap liquor . Result : fewer drunkards . Such " as would be still produced would be addicted to 60 to 70 proof instead of 80 to 100 proof . And this would be a step distinctly in the right direction . " <P> Liver , Stomach , Kidneys . No one has ever proved the old contention that alcohol causes cirrhosis ( hardening ) of the liver . It is merely known to be very bad for those who already have cirrhosis . Although years of toping may cause chronic gastritis ( inflammation of the stomach lining ) and lead to cancer , most doctors still believe that small amounts of alcohol , like the old " stomachic bitters , " are fine for the digestion . <P> As for the kidneys , Dr. Maurice Bruger of Columbia claims that , contrary to popular opinion , alcohol does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arteries ) . In fact , since a " negligible amount " of alcohol is excreted by the kidneys , " experimental studies fail to reveal that the consumption of alcohol in moderate doses is harmful to the normal , or even to the diseased kidney . " <P> Flight v. Fun . Present medical fashion regards all alcoholics as neurotics and psychotics who drink to flee from harsh reality , overcome a feeling of inadequacy , or express homosexual tendencies kept under during sober periods . Doctors ' great problem , says Director Nolan Dan Carpentier Lewis of New York State Psychiatric Institute , is to uncover the mental disorders which drive men to drink .
