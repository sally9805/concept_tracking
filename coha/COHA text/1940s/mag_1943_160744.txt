THIRTY SECONDS OVER TOKYO-Ted W. Lawson-Random House ( $2 ) . <P> After Pearl Harbor , 24 Army Air Forces officers were called together in a hotel in Minneapolis . Volunteers were wanted for a " dangerous , important and interesting " mission . No other information was forthcoming . All 24 volunteered . <P> By roundabout routes , they flew to Eglin Field , Fla . Lieut , ( now Captain ) Ted Lawson picked up four men on the way . There was matter-of-fact Dean Davenport , co-pilot ( " I liked the way he flew " ) , Charles McClure , navigator , Bob Clever , bombardier , and David Thatcher , gunner-engineer . " Without realizing it , I had picked my crew . . . . " The crews , swelled to 140 men , crowded the Operations Office to hear Major James Doolittle : " If you men have any idea that this is n't the most dangerous thing you 've ever been on , do n't even start this training period . ... If you 've guessed where we 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Lieut . Lawson was so eager to get going that the intensive training ( " Our planes were in the air at 7 a.m. each morning and sometimes we 'd still be at it at 10 p.m. " ) did not bother him . He thought the B-25 ( North America 's medium-range Mitchell bomber , stripped of its radio , bottom gun-turret and Norden bombsight ) was a lively ship . <P> Shangri-La . One afternoon at the end of March , 16 B-25s were spaced trimly over the aircraft carrier Hornet 's flight deck . Off on either side steamed cruisers and destroyers . The next morning , Doolittle told them officially what the mission was , gave them choice of city : Tokyo , Yokohama , Osaka , Kobe , Magoya . They were to land at small Chinese airfields , refuel and meet at Chungking . It would be single-file , hit- &-run,; each crew on its own . " If we all get to Chungking , I 'll throw the biggest goddamn party you ever saw . " <P> The morning of April 18 was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cruiser let go a broadside . " A low-slung ship began to give off an ugly plume of black smoke . " U.S. gunnery had gotten a small Japanese ship within three minutes . But three minutes is time enough to flash a warning . It would no longer be a night attack at 400 miles , but a daylight raid at 800 . Lawson heard the shout : " God damn ! Let 's go ! " They went . <P> At 2 that afternoon , Lawson and his crew sighted the coast of Japan . Flying in at low level they saw fruit trees in bloom , neat farms fitting into each other , farmers at work . It took iron control to pass up " the biggest , fattest-looking aircraft carrier " the crew ever saw . Every inch of shoreline was wharf , crowded with yachts and heavy ships . They flew low over the roofs toward the first of their chain of four targets . Four times the red light on the instrument board blinked , as each bomb was released . Lawson looked back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls and then subside and dissolve in a black-and-red cloud . "
