With a deep sigh of relief , the U.S. <P> Maritime Commission got rid of its biggest white elephant-the Normandie . The once-proud liner had cost the French $60 million to build , had cost the U.S. Government another $11 million to salvage and maintain . Last week the Commission sold her for scrap . Price : $161,680 . <P> The buyer : Lipsett , Inc. , a Jamestown , N.Y . steel scrap firm . Lipsett intends to cut the Normandie down to the waterline , then raise the hull and break it up . Total cost of the operation : between $600,000 and $750,000 . <P> Lipsett expects the Normandie to yield about 40,000 tons of steel scrap ( worth some $15 a ton ) , which will just about cover scrapping costs . Any profit will depend upon how much brass , copper , lead , etc. ( worth up to $240 a ton ) he can salvage . Said company President Morris Lipsett : " It 's just like a crap game <P> You never know how these things pan out . "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
