To industrial Manchester 's sooty , red-brick Albert Hall went bouncing Supply Minister Lord Beaverbrook to address an audience of 2,000 , mostly leftist shop stewards .

' And Mr. Stalin said : ' The old war horse ! ' " * <P> After the speech Lord Beaverbrook broke a Cabinet precedent by listening to workers ' complaints . One questioner asked what the Beaver thought about the nationalization of industry . He replied diplomatically : " Not a bad idea . But we ca n't have any disturbance of that kind until after we get a store of munitions in hand big enough to give the Russians all the help they need . " <P> Then the Beaver took notes while a dozen workers climbed on the platform and poured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After five weeks I was given my card fired due to a shortage of supplies .
