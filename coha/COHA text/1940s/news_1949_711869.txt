txt WASHINGTON , Feb. ** House Appropriations Committee approved the first big money bill ' of the new Congress today , and recommended a total of $466,882,117 to carry on ' various Government activities ( during the rest of the fiscal year , ending June 30 . Among important items were : ( 1 ) $12,500,000 to continue through June the War Assets Administration , which the Eightieth Congress had ordered liquidated by Feb. 28. ( 2 ) $4,800,000 to extend the life of the Office of the Housing Expediter , which handles rent control , until May 31 . Rent controls were scheduled under present legislation to expire March 31. ( 3 ) $2,500,090 to start construction of a controversial steamgenerating plant for the Tennessee Valley Authority at New Johnsonville , Tenn . The TVA item , while comparatively small , is expected to provide one of the storm centers when ( House debate begins , probably tomorrow . The Eightieth Congress refused to approve the NeW Johnsonville project . A few weeks ago President Truman asked that the undertaking be again considered and requested $3,000,000 as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steam plant was needed if the Government was to " make full utilization of the natural resources and of its investment " in the Tennessee Valley Authority . But Representative John Taber of New York , ranking minority member of the Appropriations Committee , served warning that the controversy was not ended when , in a statement issued as the report was sent to the House , he described the steam plant project as " just another flagrant case of robbing Peter to pay Paul . " He contended that taxpayers everywhere were being made to pay for the TVA 's losses in selling electrical power below cost . " I am not speaking out ' against ' // the TVA , " declared Mr. Taber in his first attack of this session on appropriations , but , he continued , " it was never contemplated that TVA would become the means by which the Federal Government would embark into the business of producing electric power in competition with industry . " He said additional power facilities in the TVA area should be built by the municipalities needing them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem of securing more power for the TVA area without resorting to decadent socialism or taking these steps towards the nationalization of the power industry in the United States , " the New Yorker continued . He estimated that one-third of the TVA 's electric power was allocated to the large industries which had moved into the area " for the purpose of operating on cheap electricity . " Gordon Clapp , chairman of the TVA , recently told the committee , headed by Representative Clarence Cannon of Missouri , that the proposed plant would enable the agency to relieve a power shortage expected in 1951 and 1952 . Defending the plant , the committee explained in its report that the great variation in the flow of the rivers in the TVA system made it necessary to " firm up " the hydrogenerated power with power from steam facilities . The committee said it was reducing President Truman 's $3,000,000 request by $500,000 because it " was not convinced " that construction could be undertaken in time to ? use the full amount of the estimate . Representative Taber estimated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generating facilities , would cost $84 , - 000,000 . Explaining that it had reduced Mr. Truman 's request for the Housing Expediter by $2,650,000 , the committee said it thought the amount recommended would keep the agency going until more lasting . rent control legislation , now under consideration , had been enacted . The committee said it had , likewise , cut the President 's request for the War Assets Administration by $2,500,000 because " there is every reason to believe that greater progress can be made during the next few months than is now anticipated " by WAA officials . In another controversial move , the committee inserted a clause , in its provision for the Interior Department 's Bureau of Reclamation , ceiling for repeal of a 1948 ban on Michael Straus as head of the bureau , and Richard Boke as regional director in Sacramento , Calif . The last Congress directed that these two men be cut off the payroll on Feb. 1 , 1949 , because they lacked engineering experience . President Truman , requesting immediate removal of the ban , declared it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have vigorously enforced the reclamation laws and the public - power policy of the Government , and who in so doing have incurred the wrath of powerful special interests . " President Truman had sought a total of $480,884,577 in the bill , known as a deficiency appropriation measure because its purpose is to make up the difference between funds the agencies have available to them , and the larger amount they now expect to spend before the fiscal year ends . The committee cut $14,002,400 from Mr. Truman 's total request . The bill will probably be debated in the House through Wednesday . It will then go to the Senate .
