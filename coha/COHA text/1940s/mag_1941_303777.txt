In a homey , handsome dining room at the Treasury Department , with a cheery fire on the hearth , hospitable Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr . entertained guests at lunch : grey-haired Senator Walter F. George of Georgia , chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , and big , bald Representative Robert L. ( " Muley " ) Doughton of North Carolina , chairman of the House Ways &; Means Committee . They were talking taxes . <P> Last month , when Mr. Morgenthau asked Chairman George and Chairman Doughton to start work on a new tax bill for 1942 to raise another $4,800,000,0000 , both gentlemen balked . But that was before the U.S. found itself at war . George &; Doughton were ready to talk turkey . <P> Hearings on the tax bill are scheduled to start around Jan. 15 , said Chairman Doughton as , pleasantly stuffed with Mr. Morgenthau 's good food , he left the Treasury . The delay is to give the President time to submit a new budget . <P> The turkey that Mr. Morgenthau and his luncheon guests expect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a far meatier excess-profits tax , fatter taxes on corporation incomes , higher personal-income taxes . It might include the 15% withholding tax on salaries that Mr. Morgenthau wanted last month , increased Social Security taxes , compulsory joint returns for husbands &; wives . It will probably be at least $5 billion bigger than 1941 's bill . <P> Whatever the Treasury wants on next year 's war taxes , said Chairman George , the Treasury shall have , so long as it does not hinder wartime production . Mr. Morgenthau 's little lunch had been a very successful party .
