Hermann Nickel , who was four years old when Hitler came to power , is 18 now . Last week , he was bound for New York , on his way to little Union College at Schenectady , where he will study political science and learn about U.S. democracy . He will be the U.S. 's first post-Hitler German exchange student . His two sponsors : the Institute for International Education ( TIME , Nov. 4 ) and the Schenectady Rotary Club , which will pay for his room &; board . <P> Ever since V-E day , Hermann has had his sights set on the U.S. He read all the books he could find in Berlin by American authors ( Tom Paine , Walt Whitman , John Dos Passes , Thornton Wilder ) . Working on the staff of Die Neue Zeitung , American-edited newspaper , he learned to speak fairly fluent English . Finally an Institute official , serving with the American Military Government in Berlin , lined up the big chance for him to study in the U.S. <P> Though raised under Naziism , young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nazi . Explained Hermann solemnly : " The merit is not my own . I owe my understanding to my parents . If I had had Nazi parents , I would have been a Nazi . " <P> The son of a tobacco merchant , Hermann attended Pastor Niemller 's Evangelical Church , spent most of the war years in school . After being inducted into an antiaircraft unit with his teachers and entire class , he decided that he was " willing not to fight for Hitler " and soon deserted . Hermann , who thinks the trouble with his countrymen is that they have been educated in " servile obedience , " hopes to bring back some of the Schenectady spirit with him . <P> He is prepared for surprises and for a cool reception . Says he : " I ca n't imagine what it will be like in America . I 've never seen a real peace land . And the ideas Americans must have about German youth ! "                  @ @ @
