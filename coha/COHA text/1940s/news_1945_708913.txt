txt " Wanted : Permanent job with bright future for young man . No experience . $250 a month to start . " Those la words spell the hope of many , of the men now reconverting to civilian life by the tens of thousands . That goal is an average of their post-war aspirations . Some have set their sights higher . some are aiming lower . a few just don t care or " have n't thought much about it . " But most homecoming veterans are deadly serious about their job chances . That feeling shows up clearly in cross-section polls conducted by the services . It is confirmed by the agencies which advise servicemen and sift them into the civilian economyFor example , Army surveys show live nut of six soldiers have pretty definite , ideas about ? their post-War : sobs . Nearly two-thirds of them plan to work for someone ele. and most of those will go back to doing the things they did before they put on uniforms . But only about a third will work for the same employers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army men , according to the surveys . and a similar number want to buy farms-Nearly all , however , lack aufbeient capital and they universally underestimate the investment needed to start a business or buy a farm . Big Migration On the Nay If veterans ' job hopes are fulfilled . there will he a big-scale migration in the first few post-war years . Negroes intend to shift from the South to the Northeast in large numbers . Nearly half the white enlisted men hope to move to the Far West . This movement already is well started . Of a quarter million returned veterans absorbed by California industries up to now , more than a third lived out of the state before the war . In San Francisco  --  the funnel through which soldiers from the Pacific pass on their way home  --  front-line headquarters have been established by scores of veterans ' service agencies . Here the servicemen get help on readjusting themselves to civilian life , and employers all over the country are given a preview of what 's ahead . ' It is here , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into everyday events . For exampld , Urban Stewart , California director of the United States Employment Service veterans employment division , finds " about 55% of the veterans have had no previous ' work experience . " ' Young Men with Big Salary Ideas And , he says , many of these , particularly the younger men who have risen , high in aviation , are apt to have an exaggerated idea of the salaries they can pull down . " Mr. Stewart cites the case of Lieutenant " Z , " who enlisted in the Navy Air Corps in his second year of college . He wanted to go into the brokerage business and set $225 a month as his minimum salary , even though he had no experience . " It takes a pretty good man to start at that , " Mr. Stewart told him . " You could find that much money as a warehouseman , probably , but the overtime and even the job would fizzle out soon . Why not get into something permanent where there is a chance for advancement ? You 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an officer in the Navy , You can do the same thing in business . " So the young lieutenant took a job at $175 in a stockbroker 's office and enrolled in a night school , Not all job hunting veterans are unskilled , however . Thousands have learned how to do new things well during their stint in the Army . Russell A. Owen , assistant director of the . San Francisco Veterans Information and Service Bureau , estimates the number at 15% to 20 ' , 4 . Dr those who had n't gotten that far when they went into the Army . " Ca n't Afford to Skip School Counselors at the Bureau urge these young men to get more education . " You ca n't afford not to , " they are told . " The Government offers you $2,000 for four years at college plus living expenses . " Even the veteran who plans to start his own business is advised to go to night school ? to learn business administration , business tax procedures and laws which may affect his business . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They think four more years of schooling would put them out in the business world at an age when they would have a hard time competing with younger men , For these the San Francisco agencies have a program . Affiliated with the information and service center are 67 other agencies , including 33 unions . The unions propose to take in servicemen for apprenticeship training at wages ranging from 30 to 65 cents an hour . To this the Government adds $50 a month fora single man , $75 to one who is married . An illustration of how this works is Tom " .1 , " a 29-year-old high school graduate with four years ' service as an infantryman . He had never worked at a steady jbb before the war , but liked to tinker in his basement woodworking shop . The cabinet makers union put ' him on a job with top apprentice wages and after four years he will have a steady position . Help From Businessmen Businessmen , likewise , help young veterans find their footing . For example , Bill who had only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oregon felt he was too old to go back to school when he got his Army release a few months ago . He had no business interest , except that he had been outstanding in athletics in school and thought ne might like to sell sporting goods . An athletic equipment firm gave him a job and is teaching him now . Businessmen often go out of their way . , boo , to aid men who want to start their own stores . Dick " R. " a pre-war insurance sales-. man , had a cold storage warehouse assignment ' in the Army . He became interested in the business and decided to open his own place with the help of a Government loan . The service bureau sent him to several leading meat dealers , and on their advice he decided he needed some business experience and more training . He is working for one of the dealers now and studying a correspondence course on air-conditioning and refrigeration . Mr. Stewart , the U.S.E.S . veterans ' director , believes any ex-serviceman who wants to work can , regardless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a lifetime invalid because of a broken back . He is making $275 a month now with work he can do in bed . A taxicab company was persuaded to take one ' of its former drivers who had lost both legs . He is doing all right Ls a dispatcher , Mr. Stewart reports . " I just tell the employer he might as well give the veteran a job , " Mr. Stewart says , ' " because it he does n't that will be just one more pension to pay . " From Grocery Counter to Radar Former grocery clerks and insurance salesmen , for example , are coming home with skills as radar or radio operators  --  and they want to employ their new talents . Or they have learned to be auto mechanics and aircraft maintenance men . Two enlisted men back from four years ' duty on submarines are typical . One grew up on a Tennessee farm : he had never seen a tractor before the war . The other was a former truck driver . Both went through the Navy 's diesel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are competing for their services . Some climb high quickly on the basis of their service experience . A pre-war janitor who earned around $100 a month became a lieutenant colonel in the Army at the age of 29 . He has just landed a selling job at $325 a month . A lot fewer veterans here are planning to return to their old jobs than the over-all Army survey indicates . The number thus far is only about 20% , the agencies report . Many men come home completely confused about what they want to do , R. A. Harrison , director of the Information and Service Bureau , says . " The world looks like a high , blank wall and they are afraid to climb it . This is particularly true of high school boys .
