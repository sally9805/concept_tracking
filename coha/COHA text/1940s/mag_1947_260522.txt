" Quiet and inoffensive " was the way his commanding officer had described Corporal Frank Aldrich . Yet Aldrich stood last week before a U.S. Army court-martial charged with murdering two Chinese soldiers on his wedding eve . The story told in court began with a bachelor brawl . Aldrich and three pals wandered around Nanking in a jeep , chased a couple of Chinese girls , and then stopped on the Chungho Bridge . " Hello ! " said Aldrich thickly to some Chinese youths perched on the bridge rail . Chinese Air Force Corpsmen Wong Shou-pen and Ke Fating did not seem to understand the greeting . Suddenly Corporal Aldrich cried , " Ding ho ! " Seizing Wong and Ke by the legs , he dumped them backward into the deep and muddy stream below . The Americans laughed ; it did not occur to them that neither Chinese could swim . <P> Questions for the Sages . In the auditorium of Nanking 's Officers ' Moral Endeavor Association last week , Chinese witnesses and the dead men 's kin were doing their best to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chinese would be impressed with the fairness and exactness of American justice . But the Chinese frankly found the procedure somewhat opaque . <P> An onlooker marveled : " Everyone must raise his hand to swear that he is a child of God and wo n't tell lies ! " One witness thought he knew what was wanted ; he put hand to forehead and intoned : " Heaven is above and earth below . May my conscience be relied upon ! " Did a witness know the difference between truth and falsehood ? the court wanted to know . When phrased in literary Chinese , this seemed a question for Kant or Confucius . The witness said " No . " Did he know the difference between right and wrong ? " Oh , naturally , " said the relieved Chinese . <P> Answers for the Unbright . But most baffling to the witnesses was the Anglo-Saxon labyrinth for sifting evidence . Sometimes it seemed inscrutable , sometimes not quite bright . The defense counsel appeared to be bothered , for instance , when a fisherman said he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then admitted he had not known the deceased . " Then how did you know the body was Wong 's ? " Retorted the fisherman : " Wong 's parents told me . " Any Chinese could understand that , but it was " hearsay " in Anglo-U.S. law . <P> Most astonishing for many Chinese present , however , was the sight of one of the judges , a lean-jawed colonel who chewed and chomped a wad of gum every day . " Perhaps , " wrote one Chinese reporter , " this is typical of American judicial custom . " After four days of testimony and gum-chewing , the court postponed its decision . The Chinese had not quite reached a decision either .
