Six years had passed since Francisco Franco called Germany and Italy " dear nations who were the vanguard of our movement . " Last week he received the A.P . ' s slow-to-startle DeWitt MacKenzie and startled him with this interview : <P> MacKenzie : " Rightly or wrongly , the American public feels that Spain was in effect an ally of Germany and Italy and finds that hard to forgive . Did you subscribe to or support Nazi and Fascist policies ? " <P> Franco : " I did not . Spain was not influenced by Germany and Italy , but has been developing along its own lines . . . . The Jews were not persecuted here , nor was any other religion . " <P> MacKenzie : " Do you subscribe to the political views of Hitler and Mussolini ? " <P> Franco : " I would call your attention to the fact that the Cortes has been functioning for three years . The Government does n't make the laws . All the laws that the Government recommends go to the Cortes for consideration and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you are headed for absolute democracy , * that is , rule by the people ? " <P> Franco : " Yes . But we must proceed slowly , step by step , until the people are properly prepared . " <P> What Spain 's people thought of this was hard to learn . Madrid 's Ecclesia , new weekly organ of the influential Catholic Action , warned : " We believe that a good dose of prudence is worth-while in these matters ; prudence not to deduce from the silence of the proletarian masses-forbidden to strike and restrained from means of uprising-unequivocal indications of their complete contentment . " Ecclesia took Spain 's leaders to task for failing to note ecclesiastical protests against injustices " for example , of absentee landlordism , a deep and endemic wrong in Andalusia , where few landlords ever know or see their possessions and where laborers live as they can on hunger wages . " <P> Ecclesia said Franco 's social legislation had not gone far enough and was not always enforced : " . . . Legislation is one thing and economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for those who must live on wages disproportionate to the cost of living . " <P> <P> *The phrase " absolute democracy " was no doubt composed in haste. - ED.
