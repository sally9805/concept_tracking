The employee agrees . . . that he will not do or commit any act or thing that will tend to degrade him in society or bring him into public hatred , contempt , scorn or ridicule , or that will tend to shock , insult or offend the community . . . or prejudice the producer or the motion picture , theatrical or radio industry in general . <P> - Standard Hollywood " Morals Clause " <P> One of the ten writers , producers and directors dredged up last year by the congressional investigation of Communism in Hollywood was 44-year-old Screenwriter Lester Cole , a balding little man who earned up to $1,350 a week turning out such epics as The Romance of Rosy Ridge and Fiesta for MGM . Like the others , he had refused to say whether or not he was then or ever had been a member of the Communist Party . After he was cited for contempt of Congress , M-G-M suspended him from his job , giving as its reason the charge that he had violated the " morals clause " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his colleagues , struck back , filed suits for reinstatement and back pay . <P> Obviously the real question was the right of an employer to kick out anyone who is a Communist , acts like one , or refuses to say whether he is or is n't one . But when Cole 's suit came before a federal jury in Los Angeles last month , the trial turned into nothing more than a legal test of MGM 's morals clause . Judge Leon R. Yankwich , charged MGM , had made a cocktail-party observation that all of the accused should be rehired . Judge Yankwich denied it , refused to disqualify himself . In the trial he made it clear that , so far as he was concerned , Communism was not an issue in the case at all . <P> He instructed the jury to consider only four questions . Did Cole 's defiance of Congress bring him into " public hatred " ? Did he " offend " the public ? Did he " prejudice " his employers ? Did M-G-M forfeit the right to break his contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Said Yankwich : " If the studio knew , when Cole came back from Washington , what his conduct had been there and nevertheless continued to reimburse him , then I instruct you that M-G-M then waived its right to take action against him . " <P> After only four hours of deliberation the jury brought out its answers : no to the first three questions , yes to the last . Judge Yankwich ordered M-G-M to put Cole back on its payroll and fork over $74,250 in back salary . M-G-M lawyers , who argued that the judge 's instructions amounted to a directed verdict for Writer Cole , got ready to take the case to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals .
