The first major event to be televised from the Atlantic coast to the Mississippi River will probably be President Truman 's inauguration in Washington on Jan. 20 . <P> <P> * Cities serviced in the East will be New York , Washington , Philadelphia , Baltimore , Boston , Schenectady , Richmond and New Haven .
