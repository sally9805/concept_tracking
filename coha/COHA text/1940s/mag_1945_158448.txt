With week-by-week regularity , a baby-faced golfer and a sawed-off miler have made the other boys feel like giving up and going home . Last week , they took one last lick at winter pickings : <P> At Atlanta , Byron Nelson putted with mechanical magic up to 45 feet , chopped 13 strokes off par for a 72-hole total of 263 , never drew a deep breath as he won the last ( and his fourth straight ) tourney of the winter circuit . The victory upped his 1945 earnings to $17,857 , gave him an eight-to-six edge in tournaments won over capable but collapsible Sammy Snead . <P> At Rhode Island 's Camp Endicott , Jim ( " Iron Mike " ) Rafferty ended a perfect , ten-race season ( including three wins over Sweden 's Gunder Hagg ) by winning the three-quarter-mile special . He watched bespectacled Haakon Lidman jack up Sweden 's sagging track reputation by lowering the 15.8 world record for the 110-meter high hurdles by 1.4 seconds . <P> But the world 's swiftest sprint swimmer lost in the National A.A.U. Indoor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alan Ford ( TIME , Feb. 26 ) tried hard to shake off lean-jawed Specialist 2/C Wally Ris , onetime mechanical engineering student at the University of Illinois . He got no farther than a half-stroke ahead in three laps . Then they both flubbed the all-important last turn , squared away even for the final spurt . Whispered 21-year-old Wally to himself : " Beat him . . . beat him . " He did-by a touch , and in New York A.C. pool-record time ( 51.3 seconds ) . <P> Loose-shouldered Ensign Adolf Kiefer , who began breaking world backstroke records ten years ago , helped Wally Ris build up a top-heavy 46-point team total for the Bainbridge ( Md . ) Naval Training Center . With strokes to spare , Kiefer copped his pet 150-yd. backstroke event and the 300-yd. individual medley . Cracked 26-year-old Adolf Kiefer to himself when he banged his funny bone against the side of the pool on the last leg of the backstroke : " What am I doing in here anyway ? I 'm too old for this sort of thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and most star swimmers are in the Navy ) it looked like the last big meet of the war .
