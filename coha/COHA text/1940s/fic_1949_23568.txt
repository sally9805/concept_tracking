Master Misery A Story by Truman Capote H ER high heels , clacking across the marble foyer , made her think of ice cubes rattling in a glass , and the flowers , those autumn chrysanthemums in the urn at the entrance , if touched they would shatter , splinter , she was sure , into frozen dust ; yet the house was warm , even somewhat over-heated , but cold , and Sylvia shivered , but cold , like the snowy swollen wastes of the secretary 's face : Miss Mozart , who dressed all in white , as though she were a nurse . Perhaps she really was ; that , of course , could be the answer : Mr. Revercomb , you are mad , and this is your nurse : she thought about it for a moment : well , no . And now the butler brought her scarf . His beauty touched her : slender , so gentle , a Negro with freckled skin and reddish , unrefleeting eyes . As he opened the door , Miss Mozart appeared , her starched uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will return , " she said , and handed Sylvia a sealed envelope , " Mr. Revercomb was most particularly pleased . " 0 UTSIDE dusk was falling like blue flakes , and Sylvia walked crosstown along the November streets until she reached the lonely upper reaches of Fifth Avenue . It occurred to her then that she might walk home through the park : an act of defiance almost , for Henry and Estelle , always insistent of their city wisdom , had said over and again , Sylvia , you have no idea how dangerous it is , walking in the park after dark : look what happened to Myrtle Calisher . This is n't Easton , honey . That was the other thing they said . And said . God , she was sick of it . Still , and aside from a few of the other typists at SnugFare , an underwear company for which she worked , who else in New York did she know ? Oh it would be all right if only she did not have to live with them , if she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there in that chintz-cramped apartment she sometimes felt she would choke them both . And why had she come to New York ? For whatever reason , and it was indeed becoming vague , a principal cause of leaving Easton had been to rid herself of Henry and Estelle ; or rather , their counterparts , though in point of fact Estelle was actually from Easton , a town north of Cincinnati . She and Sylvia had grown up together . The real trouble with Henry and Estelle was that they were so excruciatingly married : nambypamby hootsytotsyl and everything had a name : the telephone was Tinkling Tillie , the sofa Our Nelle , the bed Big Bear ; yes , and what about those His-Her towels , those He-She pillows ? Enough to drive you loony . " Loony ! " she said aloud , the quiet park caressing her voice . It was lovely now , and she was right to have walked here , with wind moving through the leaves , and globe lamps , freshly aglow , kindling the chalk drawings of children , pink birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a pair of obscene words , there appeared on the path two boys : pimple-faced , grinning , they loomed in the dusk like menacing flames , and Sylvia , passing them , felt a burning all through her , quite as though she 'd brushed fire . They turned and followed her past a deserted playground , one of them bump-bumping a stick along an iron fence , the other whistling : these two sounds accumulated around her like the gathering roar of an oncoming engine , and when one of the boys , with a laugh , called Hey 1 , Vhatsa Hurry ? her mouth twisted for breath : do n't , she thought , thinking to throw down her purse and run . At that moment , however , a man walking a dog came up a side path , and she followed at his heels to the exit . Would n't they feel gratified , Henry and Estelle , would n't they we-told-you-so if she were to tell them ? and what-is-more , Estelle would write it home and the next thing you knew it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Central Park . She spent the rest of the way home despising New York : anonymity , its virtuous terror ; and the speaking drainpipe , all-night light , ceaseless footfall , subway corridor , numbered door ( 3C ) . " Sh-h , honey , " Estelle said , sidling out of the kitchen , " Bootsy 's doing his homework . " Sure enough , Henry , a law student at Columbia , was hunched over his books in the living-room , and Sylvia , at Estelle 's request , took off her shoes before tiptoeing through . Once inside her room , she threw herself on the bed and put her hands over her eyes . Had today really happened ? Miss Mozart and Mr. Revercomb , were they really there in the tall house on Seventy-eighth Street ? " So , honey , what happened today ? " Estelle had entered without knocking . Sylvia sat up on her elbow . " Nothing . Except that I typed ninety-seven letters . " " About what , honey ? " asked Estelle , using Sylvia 's hairbrush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SnugFare , the shorts that safely support our leaders of Science and Industry . " " Gee , honey , do n't sound so cross . I do n't know what 's wrong with you sometimes . You sound so cross . Ouch why do n't you get a new brush : this one 's just knotted with hair . . . " " Mostly yours . " " What did you say ? " " Skip it . " " Oh , I thought you said something . Anyway , like I was saying , I wish you did n't have to go to that office and come home every dayfeeling cross and out of sorts . Personally , and I said this to Bootsy just last night and he agreed with me one hundred per cent , I said Bootsy , I think Sylvia ought to get married : a girl high-strung like that needs her tensions relaxed . There 's no earthly reason why you should n't : I mean maybe you 're not pretty in the ordinary sense , but you have beautiful eyes , and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sort of girl any professional man would be lucky to get . And I should think you would want to . . . look what a different person I am since I married Henry : does n't it make you lonesome seeing how happy we are ? I 'm here to tell you honey that there is nothing like lying in bed at night with a man 's arms around you and . . . . " " Estelle ! For Christ 's sake ! " Sylvia sat bolt upright in bed , anger on her cheeks like rouge . But after a moment she bit her lip , and lowered her eyelids . " I 'm sorry , " she said , " I did n't mean to shout . Only I wish you woud n't talk like that . " " It 's all right , " said Estelle , smiling in a dutnb puzzled way . Then she went over and gave Sylvia a kiss . " I understand , honey . It 's just that you 're plain worn out . And I 'll bet you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the kitchen and I 'll scramble you some eggs . " When Estelle set the eggs before her , Sylvia felt quite ashamed ; after all , Estelle was trying to be nice ; and so then , as though to make it all up , she said : " Something did happen today . " JsTELLE sat down across from her with a cup of coffee , and Sylvia went on : " I do n't know how to tell about it , It 's so very odd . But . . . well , I had lunch at the Automat today , and I had to share the table with these three men . I might as well have been invisible because they talked about the most personal things . One of the men said his girl-friend was going to have a baby and he did n't know where he was going to get the money to do anything about it . So one of the other men asked him why did n't he sell something . He said he did n't have anything to sell . Whereupon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't look as if he belonged with the others ) said yes , there was something he could sell : dreams . Even I laughed , but the man shook his head and said very seriously : no , it was perfectly true , his wife 's aunt , Miss Mozart , worked for a rich man who bought dreams , regular nighttime dreams ... from anybody . And he wrote down the man 's name and address and gave it to his friend ; but the man simply left it lying on the table : it was too crazy for him , he said . " " Me , too , " Estelle put in a little righteously . " I do n't know , " said Sylvia , lighting a cigarette . " But I could n't get it out of my head . The name written on the paper was A. F. Revercomb and the address was on East Seventy-eighth Street . I only glanced at it for a moment , but it was .. . I do n't know , I could n't seem to forget it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I left the office early . . . " Slowly , and with emphasis , Estelle put down her coffee cup . " Honey , listen , you do n't mean you went to see him , this Revercomb nut ? " " I did n't mean to , " she said , immediately embarrassed . To try and tell about it she now realized was a mistake . Estelle had no imagination , she would never understand . So her eyes narrowed , the way they always did when she composed a lie . " And as a matter of fact I did n't , " she said flatly . " I started to ; but then I realized how silly it was , and went for a walk instead . " " That was sensible of you , " said Estelle as the began stacking dishes in the kitchen sink . " Imagine what might have happened . Buying dreams ! whoever heard ? Uh uh , honey , this sure is n't Easton . " Before retiring , Sylvia took a secconal , something she seldom did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not with her mind so nimble and somersaulting ; then , too , she felt a curious sadness , a sense of loss , as though she 'd been the victim of some real or even moral theft , as though , in fact , the boys encountered in the park had snatched ( abruptly she switched on the light ) her purse . The envelope Miss Mozart had handed her : it was in the purse , and until now she had forgotten it . She tore it open . Inside there was a blue note folded around a bill ; on the note there was written : In payment of one dream , $5 . And now she believed it ; it was true , and she had sold Mr. Revercomb a dream : could it be really so simple as that ? She laughed a little as she turned off the light again . If she were to sell a dream only twice a week , think of what she could do : a place somewhere all her own , she thought , deepening toward sleep ; ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment of twilit lantern slides , deeply deeper . His lips , his arms : telescoped , descending ; and distastefully she kicked away the blanket . Were these cold man-arms the arms Estelle had spoken of ? Mr. Revercomb 's lips brushed her ear as he leaned far into her sleep : tell me ? he whispered . I T WAS a week before she saw him again , a Sunday afternoon in early December . She 'd left the apartment intending to see a movie , but somehow , and as though it had happened without her knowledge , she found herself on Madison Avenue , two blocks from Mr. Revercomb 's . It was a cold silver-skied day with winds sharp and catching as hollyhock ; in store windows icicles of Christmas tinsel twinkled amid mounds of sequined snow : all to Sylvia 's distress , for she hated holidays , those times when one is most alone . In one window she saw a spectacle which made her stop still . It was a life-sized , mechanical Santa Claus ; slapping his stomach he rocked back arid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear beyond the thick glass his squeaky , uproarious laughter . The longer she watched the more evil he seemed until finally , with a shudder , she turned and made her way into the street of Mr. Revercomb 's house . It was , from the outside , an ordinary town house , perhaps a trifle less polished , less imposing than some others , but relatively grand all the same . Winter-withered ivy writhed about the leaded window-panes and trailed in octopus ropes over the door ; at the sides of the door were two small stone lions with blind chipped eyes . Sylvia took a breath , then rang the bell . Mr. Revercomb 's pale and charming Negro recognized her with a courteous smile . On the previous visit the parlor in which she had awaited her audience with Mr : Revercomb had been empty except for herself . This time there were others present , women of several appearances , and an excessively nervous , gnat-eyed young man : had this group been what it resembled , namely MASTER patients in a doctor 's ante-room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim of St. Vitus . Sylvia was seated next to him , and his fidgety eyes unbuttoned her rapidly : whatever he saw apparently interested him very little , and Sylvia was grateful when he went back to his twitchy preoccupations . Gradually , though , she became conscious of how interested in her the assemblage seemed ; in the dim , doubtful light of the plant-filled room their gazes were more rigid than the chairs upon which they sat ; one woman was particularly relentless . Ordinarily her face would have had a soft commonplace sweetness , but now , watching Sylvia , it was ugly with distrust , jealousy . As though trying to tame some creature which might suddenly spring full-fanged , she sat stroking a flea-bitten neck fur ; her stare continuing its assault until the earthquake footstep of Miss Mozart was heard in the hall : immediately , and like frightened students , the group , separating into their individual identities , came to attention . " You , Mr. Pocker , " accused Miss Mozart , " you 're next ! " And Mr. Pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after her . In the dusk-room the gathering settled again like sun-motes . It began then to rain ; melting window reflections quivered on the walls , and Mr. Revercomb 's young butler , seeping through the room , stirred a fire in the grate , set tea things upon a table . Sylvia , nearest the fire , felt drowsy with warmth and the noise of rain ; her head tilted sideways , she closed her eyes , neither asleep nor really awake . For a long while only the crystal swingings of a clock scratched the polished silence of Mr. Revercomb 's house . And then abruptly there was an enormous commotion in the hail , capsizing the room into a fury of sound : a bull-deep voice vulgar as red roared out : " Stop Orellly ? The ballet butler and who else ? " The owner of this voice , a tub-shaped , brick-colored little man , shoved his way to the parlor threshold , where he stood drunkenly see-sawing from foot to foot . " Well well well , " he said , his gin-hoarse ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before me ? But Oreilly is a gentleman , Oreilly waits his turn . " " Not here , he does n't , " said Miss Mozart , stealing up behind him and seizing him MISERY sternly by the collar . His face went even redder and his eyes bubbled out : " You 're choking me , " he gasped , but Miss Mozart , whose green-pale hands were as strong as oak roots , jerked his tie still tighter , and propelled him toward the door , which presently slammed with shattering effect : a tea cup tinkled , and dry dahlia leaves tumbled from their heights . The lady with the fur slipped an aspirin in her mouth : " Disgusting , " she said , and the others , all except Sylvia , laughed delicately , admiringly , as Miss Mozart strode past dusting her hands . I T WAS raining thick and darkly when Sylvia left Mr. Revercomb 's . She looked around the desolate street for a taxi ; there was nothing , however , and no one ; yes , someone , the drunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city child he was leaning against a parked car and bouncing a rubber ball up arid down . " Lookit , kid , " he said to Sylvia , " Iookit , I just found this ball . Do you suppose that means good luck ? " Sylvia smiled at him ; for all his bravado , she thought him rather harmless , and there was a quality in his face , some grinning sadness suggesting a clown minus make-up . Juggling his ball , he skipped along after her as she headed toward Madison Avenue . " I 'll bet I made a fool of myself in there , " he said . " When I do things like that I just want to sit down and cry . " Standing so long in the rain seemed to have sobered him considerably . " But she ought not to have choked me that way ; damn , she 's too rough . I 've known some rough women : my sister Berenice could brand the wildest bull ; but that other one , she 's the roughest of the lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end up in the electric chair , " he said , and smacked his lips . " They 've got no cause to treat me like that . It 's every bit his fault anyhow . I did n't have an awful lot to begin with , but then he took it every bit , and now I 've got niente , kid , niente . " " That 's too bad , " said Sylvia , though she did not know what she was being sympathetic about . " Are you a clown , Mr. Oreilly ? " " Was , " he said . By this time they had reached the avenue , but Sylvia did not even look for a taxi ; she wanted to walk on in the rain with the man who had been a clown . " When I was a little girl I only liked clown dolls , " she told him , " my room at home was like a circus . " " I 've been other things besides a clown . I have sold insurance also . " " Oh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do now ? " Oreilly chuckled and threw his ball especially high ; after the catch his head still remained tilted upward : " I watch the sky , " he said . " There I am with my suitcase traveling through the blue : it 's where you travel when you 've got no place else to go . But what do I do on this planet ? I have stolen , begged , and sold my dreams . . . all for purposes of whisky . A man can not travel in the blue without a bottle . Which brings us to a point : how 'd you take it , baby , if I asked for the loan of a dollar ? " " I 'd take it fine , " Sylvia replied , and paused , uncertain of what she 'd say next . They wandered along so slowly , the stiff rain enclosing them like an insulating pressure ; it was as though she were walking with a childhood doll , one grown miraculous and capable ; she reached and held his hand : dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't got a dollar . All I 've got is seventy cents . " " No hard feelings , " said Oreilly . " But honest , is that the kind of money he 's paying nowadays ? " Sylvia knew whom he meant . " No , no . . . as a matter of fact , I did n't sell him a dream . " She made no attempt to explain : she did n't understand it herself . Confronting the graying invisibility of Mr. Revercomb ( impeccable , exact as a scale , surrounded in a cologne of clinical odors ; flat gray eyes planted like seed in the anonymity of his face and sealed within steel-dull lenses ) she could not remember a dream , and so she told of two thieves who had chased her through the park and in and out among the swings of a playground . " Stop , he said for me to stop ; there are dreams and dreams , he said , but that is not a real one , that is one you are making up . Now how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him another dream ; it was about him , of how he held me in the night with balloons rising and moons falling all around . He said he was n't interested in dreams concerning himself . " Miss Mozart , who took the dreams in shorthand , was told to call the next person . " I do n't think I 'll go back there again , " she said . " You will , " said Oreilly . " Look at me , even I go back , and he has long since finished with me , Master Misery . " " Master Misery ? Why do you call him that ? " They had reached the corner where the maniacal Santa Claus rocked and bellowed : his laughter echoed in the rainy squeaking street , and a shadow of him swayed in the rainbow lights of the pavement . Oreilly , turning his back upon the Santa Claus , smiled and said : " I call him Master Misery on account of that 's who he is . Master Misery . Only maybe you call him something else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must 've known his : all mothers tell their kids about him : he lives in hollows of trees , he comes down chimneys late at night , he lurks in graveyards and you can hear his step in the attic : the son-of-a-bitch , he is a thief and a threat : he will take everything you have and end by leaving you nothing , not even a dream . Boo ! " he shouted , and laughed louder than Santa Claus . " Now do you know who he is ? " Sylvia nodded . " I know who he is . My family called him something else . But I ca n't remember what . It was so long ago . " " But you remember him ? " " Yes , I remember him . " " Then call him Master Misery , " he said and , bouncing his ball , walked away from her . " Master Misery , " his voice trailed to a mere moth of sound , " Mas-ter Mis-er-y PP I -r was hard to look at Estelle , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window was filled with windy sun , which hurt Sylvia 's eyes , and the glass rattled , which hurt her head . Also , Estelle was lecturing . Her nasal voice sounded as though her throat were a depositor for rusty razor blades . " I wish you could see yourself , " she was saying . Or was that something she 'd said a long while back ? Never mind . " I do n't know what 's happened to you : I 'll bet you do n't weigh a hundred pounds , I can see every bone and vein , and your hair ! you look like a poodle . " Sylvia passed a hand over her forehead . " What time is it , Estelle ? " " It 's four , " she said , interrupting herself long enough to look at her watch . " But where is your watch ? " " I sold it , " said Sylvia , too tired to lie . It did not matter . She had sold so many things , including her beaver coat and gold mesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give up , honey , I plain give up . And that was the watch your mother gave you for graduation . It 's a shame , " she said , and made an old-maid noise with her mouth , " a pity and a shame . I 'll never understand why you left us ; that is your business , I 'm sure ; only how could you have left us for this . . . this . . . . " " Dump , " supplied Sylvia , using the word advisedly . It was a furnished room in the East Sixties between Second and Third Avenues . Large enough for a day-bed and a splintery old bureau with a mirror like a cataracted eye , it had one window , which looked out on a vast vacant lot ( you could hear the tough afternoon voices of desperate running boys ) and in the distance , like an exclamation point for the skyline , there was the black smoke-stack of a factory . This smoke-stack occurred frequently in her dreams ; it never failed to arouse Miss Mozart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , glancing up from her shorthand . The floor of the room was a garbage pail of books begun but never finished , antique newspapers , even orange hulls , fruit cores , underwear , a spilled powder box . Estelle kicked her way through this trash , and sat down on the day-bed . " Honey , you do n't know , but I 've been worried crazy . I mean I 've got pride and all that and if you do n't like me , well okay ; but you 've got no right to stay away like this and not let me hear from you in over a month . So today I said to Bootsy , Bootsy I 've got a feeling something terrible has happened to Sylvia . You can imagine how I felt when I called your office and they told me you had n't worked there for the last four weeks . What happened , were you fired ? " " Yes , I was fired . " Sylvia began to sit up . " Please , Estelle .. I 've got to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be still . You 're not going anywhere till I know what 's wrong . The landlady downstairs told me you were found sleepwalking . . . . " " What do you mean talking to her ? Why are you spying on me ? " E sTELLE 's eyes puckered , as though she were going to cry . She put her hand over Sylvia 's and petted it gently . " Tell me , honey , is it because of a man ? " " It 's because of a man , yes , " said Sylvia , laughter at the edge of her voice . " You should have come to me before , " Estelle sighed . " I know about men . That is nothing for you to he ashamed of . A man can have a way with a woman that kind of makes her forget everything else . If Henry was n't the fine upstanding potential lawyer that he is , why , I would still love him , and do things for him that before I knew what it was like to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But honey , this fellow you 're mixed up with , he 's taking advantage of you . " " It 's not that kind of relationship , " said Sylvia , getting up and locating a pair of stockings in the furor of her bureau drawers . " It has n't got anything to do with love . Forget about it . In fact , go home and forget about me altogether . " Estelle looked at her narrowly . " You scare me , Sylvia ; you really scare me . " Sylvia laughed and went on getting dressed . " Do you remember a long time ago when I said you ought to get married ? " " Uh huh . And now you listen . " Sylvia turned around ; there was a row of hairpins spaced across her mouth ; she extracted them one at a time all the while she talked . " You talk about getting married as though it were the answer absolute ; very well , up to a point I agree : sure I want to be loved , who the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to compromise , where is the man I 'm going to marry ? Believe me , he must 've fallen down a manhole . I mean it seriously when I say there are no men in New York . . . and even if there were how do you meet them ? Every man I ever met here who seemed the slightest bit attractive was either married , too poor to get married . or queer . And anyway , this is no place to fall in love ; this is where you ought to come when you want to get over being in love . Sure , I suppose I could marry somebody ; but do I want that ? do I ? " Estelle shrugged . " Then what do you want ? " " More than is coming to me . " She poked the last hairpin into place , and smoothed her eyebrows before the mirror . " I have an appointment , Estelle , and it is time for you to go now . " " I ca n't leave you like this , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sylvia , you were my childhood friend . " That is just the point : we 're not children anymore , at least I 'm not . No , I want you to go home , and I do n't want you to come here again . I just want you to forget about me . Estelle fluttered at her eyes with a handkerchief , and by the time she reached the door she was weeping quite loudly . Sylvia could not afford remorse : having been mean there was nothing to be but meaner . " Go on , " she said , following Estelle into the hall , " and write home any damn nonsense about me you want to ! " Letting out a wail that brought other roomers to their doors , Estelle fled down the stairs . AFT ER this Sylvia went back into her room and sucked a piece of sugar to take the sour taste out of her mouth : it was her grandmother 's remedy for bad tempers . Then she got down on her knees and pulled from under the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened the box it played a homemade and somewhat dis- v version of " Oh How I Hate To Get Up In The Morning . " Her brother had made the music-box and given it to her on her fourteenth birthday . Eating the sugar she 'd thought of her grandmother , and hearing the tune she thought of her brother ; the rooms of the house where they had lived rotated before her , all dark and she like a light moving among them : up the stairs , down , out and through , spring sweet and lilac shadows in the air and the creaking of a porch-swing ; all gone , she thought , calling their names , and now I am absolutely alone . The music stopped . But it went on in her head ; she could hear it bugling above the child-cries of the vacant lot . And it interfered with her reading . She was reading a little diary-like hook she kept inside the box . In this book she wrote down the essentials of her dreams ; they were endless now , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell Mr. Revercomb about the three blind children : he would like that : the prices he paid varied , and she was sure this was at least a ten-dollar dream . The cigar-box anthem followed her down the stairs and through the streets and she longed for it to go away . In the store where the Santa Claus had been there was a new and equally unnerving exhibit . Even when she was late to Mr. Revercomb 's , as now , Sylvia was compelled to pause by the window . A plaster girl with intense glass eyes sat astride a bicycle pedaling at the maddest pace ; though its wheel-spokes spun hypnotically , the bicycle of course never budged : all that effort and the poor girl going nowhere . It was a pitifully human situation , and one that Sylvia could so exactly identify with her own that she always felt a real pang . The music-box rewound in her head : the tune , her brother , the house , a high-school dance , the house , the tune ! could n't Mr. Revercomb hear it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he seemed pleased with her dream , and when she left , Miss Mozart gave her an envelope containing ten dollars . " I had a ten-dollar dream , " she told Oreilly , and Oreilly , rubbing his hands together , said , " Fine ! Fine ! But that 's just my luck , baby . . . you should 've got here sooner cause I went and did a terrible thing : I walked into a liquor store up the street , snatched a quart and ran . " Sylvia did n't believe him until he produced from his pinned-together overcoat a bottle of bourbon , already half gone . " You 're going to get in trouble some day , " she said , " and then what would happen to me ? I do n't know what I would do without you . " Oreilly laughed and poured a shot of the whisky into a water glass . They were sitting in an all-night cafeteria , a great glaring food-depot alive with blue mirrors and raw murals . Although to Sylvia it seemed a sordid place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could have afforded it she did not know where else they could go , for together they presented a curious aspect : a young girl and a doddering drunken man . Even here people often stared at them ; if they stared long enough Oreilly would stiffen with dignity and say : " Hello , hot lips , I remember you from way back : still working in the men 's room ? " But usually they were left to them-MASTER selves , and sometimes they would sit talking until two and three in the morning . " It 's a good thing the rest of Master Misery 's crowd do n't know he gave you that ten bucks : one of them would say you stole the dream : I had that happen once . Eaten up , all of ' em , never saw such a bunch of sharks , worse than actors or clowns or business men . Crazy , if you think about it : you worry whether you 're going to go to sleep , if you 're going to have a dream , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round . So you get a couple of bucks , so you rush to the nearest liquor store . . . or the nearest sleeping pill machine . And first thing you know you 're roaming your way up outhouse alley . Why baby , you know what it 's like ? It 's just like life . " " No , Oreilly , that 's what it is n't like . It has n't anything to do with life . It has more to do with being dead . I feel as though everything were being taken from me , as though some thief were stealing me down to the bone : Oreilly . I tell von i have n't an ambition , and there used to he so much . I do n't understand it and I do n't know what to do , " He grinned . " And you say it is n't like life ? Who understands life and who knows what to do ?

" If only I knew what he wanted with those dreams , all typed and filed . What does he do with them ? You 're right when you say he is Master Misery . .. he ca n't be simply some silly quack , it ca n't be so meaningless as that . But why does he want dreams ? Help me , Oreilly , think , think : what does it mean ? " S QUINTING one eye , Oreilly poured himself another drink : the clown-like twist of his mouth hardened into a line of scholarly straightness. - That is a million-dollar question , kid . Why do n't you ask something easy , like how to cure the common cold ? Yes , kid , what does it mean ? I have thought about it a good deal . I have thought about it in the process of making love to a woman , and I have thought about it in the middle of a poker game . " He tossed the drink down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start a dream ; the noise of one car passing in the night can drop a hundred sleepers into the deep parts of themselves : It 's funny to think of that one car racing through the dark trailing so many dreams . Sex , a sudden change of light , a pickle , these are little keys that can open up our insides , too . But most dreams begin because there are furies inside of us that blow open all the doors . I do n't believe in Jesus Christ , but I do believe in people 's souls ; and I figure it this way , baby : dreams are the mind of the soul and the secret truth about us . Now Master Misery , maybe he has n't got a soul , so bit by bit he borrows yours , steals it like he would steal your dolls or the chicken-wing off your plate . Hundreds of souls have passed through him and gone into a filing case . " " Oreilly , be serious , " she said again , annoyed because she thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soup is ... " she stopped abruptly , startled by Oreilly 's peculiar expression . He was looking toward the entrance . Three men were there , two policemen and a civilian wearing a clerk 's cloth jacket . The clerk was pointing toward their table . Oreilly 's eyes circled the room with trapped despair ; lie sighed then , and leaned back in his seat , ostentatiously pouring himself another drink . " Good evening , gentlemen , " he said when the official party confronted him , " will you join us for a drink ? " " You ca n't arrest him , " cried Sylvia , " you ca n't arrest a clown ! " She threw her ten-dollar bill at them , but the policemen did not pay any attention , and she began to pound the table . All the customers in the place were staring , and the manager came running up , wringing his hands . The police said for Oreilly to get to his feet . " Certainly , " Oreilly said , " though I do think it shocking you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when everywhere there are master thieves afoot . For instance , this pretty child , " he stepped between the officers and pointed to Sylvia , " she is the recent victim of a major theft : poor baby , she has had her soul stolen . " III F OR two days following Oreilly 's arrest Sylvia did not leave her room : sun on the window , then dark . By the third day she had run out of cigarettes , so she ventured 46 H VAVA iiNE as far as the corner delicatessen . She bought a package of cup-cakes , a can of sardines , a newspaper , and cigarettes . In all this time she 'd not eaten and it was a light , delicious sharpening sensation ; but the climb back up the stairs , the relief of closing the door , these so exhausted her she could not quite make the day-bed : she slid down to the floor and did not move until it was day again : she thought afterward that she 'd been there about twenty minutes . Turning on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chair up to the window and opened the newspaper on her lap : Lana Denies , Russia Rejects , Miners Conciliate : of all things this was saddest , that life goes on : if one leaves one 's lover , life should stop for him , and if one disappears from the world , then the world should stop , too : and it never did . And that was the real reason for most people getting up in the morning : not because it would matter but because it would n't . But if Mr. Revercomb succeeded finally in collecting all the dreams out of every head perhaps the idea slipped , became entangled with radio and newspaper . Falling Temperatures . A snow storm moving across Colorado , across the West , falling upon all the small towns , yellowing every light , filling every footfall , falling now and here : but how quickly it had come , the snowstorm : the roofs , the vacant lot , the distance deep in white and deepening , like sleep . She looked at the paper and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snowing all day . It could not have just started . There was no sound of traffic ; in the swirling wastes of the vacant lot children circled a bonfire ; a car , buried at the curb , winked its headlights : help ! help ! silent , like the heart 's distress . She crumbled a cup-cake and sprinkled it on the windowsill : north-birds would come to keep her company . And she left the window open for them ; snow-wind scattered flakes that dissolved on the floor like April-fool jewels . Present Life Can Be Beautiful : turn down that radio ! the witch of the woods was tapping at her door : Yes , Mrs. Halloran , she said , and turned off the radio altogether . Snow-quiet , sleep-silent , only the fun-fire faraway songsinging of children ; and the room was blue with cold colder than the cold of fairy tales : lie down my heart among the igloo flowers of snow : Mr. Revercomb , why do you wait upon the threshold ? ah , do come inside , it is so cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm and held . The window was closed , and a man 's arms were around her . He was singing to her , his voice gentle but jaunty : cherry berry , money berry , happyberry pie , but the best old pie is a loveberry pie ? " Oreilly , is it ... is it really you ? " He squeezed her . " Baby 's awake now . And how does she feel ? " " I had thought I was dead , " she said , and happiness winged around inside her like a bird lamed but still ! flying . She tried to hug him and she was too weak . " I love you , Oreilly ; you are my only friend and 1 was so frightened : I thought I would never see you again . " She paused , remembering . " But why are n't you in jail ? " Oreiny 's face got all tickled and pink . " I was never in jail , " he said mysteriously . " Bur first , let 's have something to eat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She had a sudden feeling of floating . " How long have you been here ? " " Since yesterday , " he said , fussing around with bundles and paper plates . " You let me in yourself . " " That 's impossible . I do n't remember it at all . " " I know , " he said , leaving it at that . " Here , drink your milk like a good kid and I 'll tell you a real wicked story . Oh it 's wild , " he promised , slapping his sides gladly and looking more than ever like a clown . " Well , like I said , I never was in jail and this bit of fortune came to me because there I was being hustled down the street by those bindlestiffs when who should I see come swinging along but the gorilla woman : you guessed it , Miss Mozart . Hi , I says to her , off to the barber shop for a shave ? It 's about time you were put under arrest , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do your duty , officer . Oh , I says to her , I 'm not under arrest : me , I 'm just on my way to the station-house to give them the lowdown on you , you dirty communist . You can imagine what sort of holler she set up then ; she grabbed hold of me and the cops grabbed hold of her . .. ca n't say I did n't warn them : careful , boys . she 's got hair on her chest . And she sure did lay about her . So I just sort of walked off down the street . Never have believed in standing around MASTER watching fist-fights the way people do in this city . " Oreilly stayed with her in the room over the weekend . It was like the most beautiful party Sylvia could remember ; she 'd never laughed so much , for one thing , and no one , certainly no one in her family , had ever made her feel so loved . Oreilly was a fine cook , and he fixed delicious dishes on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windowsill and made sherbet favored with strawberry syrup : by Sunday she was strong enough to dance . They turned on the radio and she danced until she fell to her knees windless and laughing . " I 'll never he afraid again , " she said . " I hardly know what I was afraid of to begin with . " " The same things you 'll be afraid of the next time , " Oreilly told her quietly . - That is a quality of Master Misery : no one ever knows what he is . . . not even children , and they know mostly everything . " Sylvia went to the window ; an arctic whiteness lay over the city , but the snow had stopped , and the night sky was as clear as ice : there , riding above the river , she saw the first star of evening . " I see the first star , " she said , crossing her fingers . " And what do you wish when you see the first star ? " " I wish to see another star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I usually wish . " " But tonight ? " She sat down on the floor and leaned her head against his knee . " Tonight I wished that I could have back my dreams . " " Do n't we all ? " Oreilly said , stroking her hair . " But then what would you do ? I mean what would you do if you could have them back ? " Sylvia was silent a moment ; when she spoke her eyes were gravely distant . " I would go home , " she said slowly . " And that is a terrible decision , for it would mean giving up most of my other dreams . But if Mr. Revercomb would let me have them back , then I would go home tomorrow . " Saying nothing Oreilly went to the closet and brought back her coat . " But why ? " she asked as he helped her on with it . " Never mind , " he said , " just do what I tell you . We 're going to pay Mr. Revercomb a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you back your dreams . It 's a chance . " Sylvia balked at the door . " Please , Oreilly , do n't make me go ; I ca n't , please , I 'm afraid . " -I thought you said you 'd never be afraid again . " B UT once in the street he hurried her so quickly against the wind she did not have time to be frightened . It was Sunday , stores were closed and the traffic lights seem to wink only for them , for there were no moving cars along the snow-deep avenue . Sylvia even forgot where they were going , and chattered of trivial oddments : right here at this corner is where she 'd seen Garbo , and over there , that is where the old woman was run over . Presently , however , she stopped , out of breath and overwhelmed with sudden realization . " I ca n't , Oreilly , " she said , pulling back . " What can I say to him ? " " Make it like a business deal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want your dreams , and if he 'll give them to you you 'll pay back all the money : on the installment plan , naturally . It 's simple enough , kid : why the hell could n't he give them back ? They are all right there in a filing case . " This speech was somehow convincing and , stamping her frozen feet , Sylvia went ahead with a certain courage . " That 's the kid , " he said . They separated on Third Avenue , Oreilly being of the opinion that Mr. Revercomb 's immediate neighborhood was not for the moment precisely safe . He confined himself in a doorway , now and then lighting a match and singing aloud : but the best old pie is a whiskyberry pie ! Like a wolf a long thin dog come padding over the moon-slats under the elevated , and across the street there were the misty shapes of men ganged around a bar : the idea of maybe cadging a drink in there made him groggy . Just as he had decided on perhaps trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in his arms before he knew that it was really her . " It ca n't he so bad , sweetheart , " he said softly , holding her as best he could . " Do n't cry , baby ; it 's too cold to cry : you 'll chap your face . " As she strangled for words her crying evolved into a. tremulous , unnatural laugh : the air was filled with the smoke of her laughter . " Do you know what he said , " she gasped , " do you know what he said when I asked for my dreams ? " Her head fell back , and her laughter rose and carried over the street like an abandoned , wildly-colored kite : OrelIly had finally to shake her by the shoulders . " He said ... I could n't have them back because ... because he 'd used them all up . " She was silent then , her face smoothing into an expressionless cairn . She put her arm through Oreilly 's , and together they moved down the street ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . each waiting for the other 's train , and when they reached the corner he cleared his throat and said : " I guess I 'd better turn here . It 's as like a spot as any . " Sylvia held on to his sleeve . - But where will you go , Oreilly ? " " Traveling in the blue , " he said , trying a smile that did n't work out very well . She opened her purse . " A man can not travel in the blue without a bottle , " she said and , kissing him on the cheek , slipped five dollars in his pocket . " Bless you , baby . " It did not matter that it was the last of her money , that now she would have to walk home , and alone . The pilings of snow were like the white waves of a white sea , and she rode upon them , carried by winds and tides of the moon : I do not know what I want , and perhaps I shall never know , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star ; and truly I am not afraid , she thought . Two boys came out of a bar and stared at her ; in some park some long time ago she 'd seen two boys and they might be the same . Truly I am not afraid , she thought , hearing their snowy footsteps following after her : and anyway , there was nothing left to steal . Primavera SYLVIA STALLINGS r-F-1 HE rain arrived this morning I Furtively : she came coastwise On a sloop from Hatteras , past the snoring foghorns And the restless lightships . Nobody saw her come But a wakeful robin , and he made a song Inaudibly about it before day . But by seven o'clock The gutters hummed and woke me To a gelatine morning where light sluggishly Seeped in among chimneys and hardly earned its name . The rain was pleased with herself ; she thumped the tin Roof with elastic drops and lavished special Attention ( like a true hypocrite ) on a frost-bitten Jonquil . She was waiting for the wind And shortly after breakfast he came up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Nobody had told him That she was coming . For a while the world snapped like a firecracker , But I saw them go off together over the river An hour later , arm in arm , And quickly opened my window ; There stood the spring .
