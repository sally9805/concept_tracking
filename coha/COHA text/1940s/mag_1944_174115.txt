After five days of hot-potato passing between the Pentagon Building and the White House , the top football game of the year-Army v. Navy-was finally moved from the seclusion of Annapolis ' Thompson Stadium ( capacity 18,000 ) to Baltimore Stadium ( with temporary stands , 70,000 to 80,000 ) . Several hundred thousand more would like to see the two service teams slug it out on Dec. 2 . Last week in its final warmup , Navy played without its top running back , Bob Jenkins , made liberal use of reserves ( even used subs not listed on the program ) to breeze by Purdue , 32-to-0 . Army fumbled and bumbled , but had power to burn as it walloped Pennsylvania , 62-to-7.
