txt The Government is doling out spices and condiments with a cautious hand . but , before the war is over . Americans may have eaten themselves out of many favorite seasonings . Almost without exception , the seeds , roots and leaves used as food flavorings come from the exotic corners of the world , largely from Asia and Africa . Some important spice-producing lands are in the hands of the Japanese : some are not , but American ships now have more urgent errands . So war has left the spice trade , one of the oldest and most romantic forms of international commerce , a shadow of its former robust self . In many instances stocks accumulated before the war roust last for the duration . This , in time , may mean pretty lean spice rations War has not only broken up the spice trade routes but has increased the t emand . Traditionally , the white man in the tropics is a heavy condiment user : spices stimulate appetites jaded by the unbroken heat . As thousands and thousands of American troops move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condiments increases , Current Government spice quotas to retailers are a good index of relative scarcity . Black pepper  --  Far and away the most important in volume of consumption . it is being allotted each quarter on the basis of 90% of the 1941 period sales . This product comes chiefly from the East Indies . but , fortunately , there was a pre-war stock on hand equal to more than two years normal consumption . Some shipments have been coming through . Vr'hit.P pepper  --  The ' simply is smaller and the present quota is 75% . Nutmegs  --  These are imported mostly from the Celebes in the Dutch Indies but Grenada In the British West Indies can supply some . The allotment is 75% . Ginger  --  A 115% allotment There was a good supply of ginger in this country before the war and occasional shipments htive come through with India . British West Africa anti Jamaica . Cloves  --  Imported from Zanzibar and Madagascar . The quota is 100 , : , , of 1941 with the spice trade reporting shipments coming through with a fair degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 75% quota . Cinnamn.n  --  Second only to black pepper in importance , natural cinnamon is the scarcest of all important spices . It has a 50%. quota The spice trade thinks the supply may be exhausted by early summer . Mustard and red pepper  --  This country can grow its own supplies . Sage is normally imported in considerable quantities from Dalmatia : since the war it has been giown here in widely scattered areas . While the general spice supply may be eked out for some time by careful handling . housewives and industrial consumers face a steadily increasing shortage of many varieties In time this means that some of the flavor will depart from pickles . sausages , other prepared meats and many bakery products . Synthetic Cinnamon Successful Since the outbreak of war , the chemists have had a fling at duplicating the tropical spices . : n only one instance has the test tube product proved commercially successful . Synthetic cinnamon has been placed on the market and is row being sold well under the price of the natural spice . Just a year ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mighty scarce commodity , the D L Slade Co. of Boston . which has been grinding spices since 1837 , decided to look into the possibility of a synthetic substitute . The Germans , they knew , had carried on experiments in this line during the first World War . The Slade company got in touch with E. C Crocker. food expert of Arthur D. Little Co. of Cambridge . large independent research chemists . Out of then combined studies has come an artificial cinnamon that closely duplicates the natural product in odor and taste . The essential ingredient of cinnamon is cinnamic aldehyde. a chemical known to the trade for generations It is a thin yellow oil having the pungent , sweet odor and taste characteristic of cinnamon . This chemical is readily available in normal times , but as it has specific war uses . it is not generally available at this time . However , a small part of the supply can be used as a food ingredient . It was the objective of the Little company to find the other flavoring chemicals which would complete the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stabilizing agents . These things were done . The carrying agent is powdered pecan shells bought directly from the shellers . The stabiping agent , used to maintain the strength and character of the cinnamic aldehyde. is a trade secret . Thus far Slade 's synthetic cinnamon has found favor with the industrial and household consumers to whom it has been sold . At first it was sold only to one bakers ' supply house , Jos Middleby , Jr. , Inc. , but after three months it was sold in bulk to other wholesalers for distribution to smaller bakers . Now it is being sold at retail In some of the chain supermarkets in the Boston area and retail distribution will be extended . Shortly Slade will be selling as much synthetic as natural cinnamon : later it will sell more . At retail the new artificial item is being sold at the pre-war price of the natural product , 10 cents for a three-ounce package . At the outbreak of war the wholesale price of imported cinnamon or cassia soared from 20 cents to about 85 cents a pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " small box " price of ground cinnamon jumped from 35 cents to 51.10 per pound and then was fixed at that level by the O.P.A. At present the ' small boxwholesale price of artificial cinnamon is 30.5 cents a pound . Four other producers in addition to Slade are now offering synthetic cinnamon . These use a cereal rather than a pecan-shell carrier . The Slade company regards the synthetic development as purely a wartime expedient . It does not believe there will be any real interest In the artificial product when natural cinnamon and cassia are available in normal supply and at normal prices .
