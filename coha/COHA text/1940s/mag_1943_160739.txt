Trim , dark-eyed Anne Josephine Shofner gave a party last week in Portland . Ore . She fed baked beans to the city 's politicos , Navy brass hats and scores of grimy workers . On her guest of honor , decked out in roses , glutted with pigiron , she splattered champagne . After the party , the guest-a $70,000 Lectromelt furnace-went hotly to work turning out steel for Mrs. Shofner 's steel casting plant . <P> Mrs. Shofner , 43 , only steelwoman on the West Coast , has had little time for ordinary partygoing . Married in 1919 , she took over her husband 's railroad brake-shoe foundry at Linnton , Ore . when he died four years later . Mrs. Shofner did not like the cut of the brake shoe , patented a better one , sold her tidy little business for $200,000 in 1937 . She bought a first-class ticket to Europe , but soon found she was less interested in cathedrals and art galleries than in the sooty , sprawling plants of the Ruhr , of Milan . She fell in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a site for her steel plant , flew to Washington , successfully besieged Federal officials for defense contracts . White-haired , handsome Edward R. Stettinius Jr . ( then director of priorities for OPM ) chortled : " Say , she 's about three jumps ahead of us . " <P> She got her contracts , poured her first steel eleven days after Pearl Harbor . To meet Navy production schedules ( for valve fittings , aircraft-carrier arresting gear , submarine net cable-guides ) , Mrs. Shofner deliberately overloaded her melting furnaces a full 100% . This was dangerous , but she put her faith in a skilled crew and a silver medal ( the Virgin on one side , Christ on the other ) sealed in the foundation of the furnaces . Said she : " God 's on our side and anything that comes out of these furnaces fights our war . " <P> She has since enlarged her plant ( with a $187,000 Government loan ) , installed the new Lectromelt furnace , and expects to quintuple capacity . Now she plans to enlarge the tiny kitchenette in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late-working employes , and hopes to can some of the vegetables she grows in the big Victory garden behind the plant . But Mrs. Shofner is no housewife at heart . She says : " The most beautiful thing in the world is a red-hot steel casting in the making . "
