txt Disfranchised Red Cross Workers As a woman who served in the American Red Cross in France and Germany in World War I , I am interested in the legitimate gripe of A. H. S. 's daughter at not being able to vote because she is- not considered a member of the armed forces , although by going to Europe with the Red Cross she has risked her life at least as much as the Wacs there . The Red Crossers of this war ought to see to it that their rights are protected . We who do foreign service under the jurisdiction of the Army are truly veterans .. I fear that A. H. S. 's daughter wilt find that the service she gives , the friendships she makes , will be the only privileges she will get out of Red Cross service . P. M. K. Arlington , Mass. , Oct. 27 , 1944.
