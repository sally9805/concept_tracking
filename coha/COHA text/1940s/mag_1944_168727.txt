Christian Adolf Volf has studied the human ear for 25 years . A balding , Danish-born inventor and onetime Sonotone engineer , he calls himself an acoustical physicist . <P> Lecturing at Los Angeles ' John Tracy ear clinic ( named for Spencer Tracy 's deaf son ) , Volf propounded a revolutionary theory : physiologists have been all wrong in teaching that the ear 's semicircular canals are responsible for man 's equilibrium . Equilibrium , said Volf , is an acquired trait that man has to learn by becoming " attuned to rhythmic conformity with the rotation of the earth . " <P> Volf had observed that deaf people without semicircular canals seem to have no difficulty in balancing themselves , that many had become outstanding dancers . But his most startling " evidence " was his observation of the way certain people walk . A child , said Volf , always takes his first toddling steps toward the east . Why ? Because the earth 's rotation in that direction makes it easier . Suggested Volf : " Just try to call a child who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are west of the child , he will stop , sit down , turn around and crawl back on all fours . " <P> The same , said Volf , holds true for drunks . He declared that he had found from careful observation that helpless drunks always walk east , fall down when they try to walk west . A drunk , Volf noted further , will resist entering a car or patrol wagon when it faces west but climb aboard willingly if it faces east . And he is much easier to lift to his feet if he faces east . Another useful tip : some drunks only fight facing eastward . Volf advice : " The fight may be avoided if the opponent will cause the intoxicant to face westward . This impels the intoxicant to fall backward . "
