Letters to The Times Oil Royalty Held Excessive Rate of Return to Venezuela Laid to State Department Action To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : There appeared on your editorial page of Oct. 22 in an article dealing with the revolt in Venezuela the following statement : " Despite the renegotiated contracts under the oil law of 1943 , the average Venezuelan man-inthe-street never felt that his country was getting its fair share of the profits from the oil wells . A popular view was that tariffs and prices could be lowered if more revenue could be secured from the foreign oil concessionaires . " I hope that you did not intend to imply that the view you believe held by the Venezuelan man-in-the-street is justified . More important , however , is the source of your information as to what the average Venezuelan thinks of this question . Minority Groups Active You are surely not accepting the clamor of the radical minority groups present in every Latin-American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confiscation of American investments , being both anti-capital and anti-foreign . I very much question whether the representative Venezuelan citizen really believes that his country is not getting at least its full share from the development of its natural resources . I believe further that if you will investigate the sources of the oil law of 1943 you will find that the royalty rate of 16 2/8 per cent was regarded by certain Venezuelan authorities as ex ' cessive and it was only due to the insistence of our own State Department that the Venezuelan Government enacted , and the oil companies were compelled to accept , this stiff royalty rate . I say the State Department in spite of the fact that officially the State Department declined responsibility for its part in this bit of Latin-American diplomatic strategy . As a matter of fact , however , the record shows that our Under-Secretary of State in 1942 encouraged the Venezuelans to proceed against the " oil trusts " with a view to enlarging the Venezuelans ' share and a man bearing the title of petroleum adviser to the State Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was instrumental in bringing about the acceptance by the American companies . This was a Punch and Judy show , as the individual in question acted the part of Punch today and Judy tomorrow , in that while he held his title and operated from his office in the State Department , every official effort was made to have him regarded as an individual citizen with no official authority from the Washington Administration . Demands Held Excessive It would be very unfortunate for the oil companies in Venezuela , and more so for the Venezuelan people them ' selves , if the idea is permitted to spread that Venezuela is not getting a ' fair share from its petroleum reserves . The fact is that the demands placed upon the American oil companies at present are excessive and will redound to the detriment of Venezuela at such time as any real competition appears in world oil markets . It is sincerely to be hoped that the policy which prevailed during the Roosevelt Administration of encouraging foreign confiscation such as that in Mexico , which was really more disastrous for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will not prevail at this time .

Subway Clocks Scarce To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I have often wondered why there is an almost complete absence of clocks in subway stations , considering how essential a time factor is for the vast majority of people passing through these places . This was brought home to me with special force today when I was asked for the time by a cashier in a subway booth . This seems to me a very direct hint to the subway authorities that by providing clocks on the stations they would help not only the general public but also their own services . HUGO MARX . Forest Hills , L. I. , Oct. 30 , 1945 . Dublin Conference Aftermath To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : It was with concern that I read the statement of eighteen distinguished men and women headed by President Karl T. Compton of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Dr. William Emerson , taking exception to the findings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all its sessions I can speak with some authority on its deliberations . To begin with , the conference in its findings never suggested " scrapping " the United Nations Organization , as intimated by the eighteen . On the contrary , it was stated time and again that the most promising approach to world government for the prevention of war was through the present machinery of the United Nations Organization ; but that if this failed , efforts should be made to call a new World Constitutional Convention . At the same tteee , however , we wished to make it perfectly clear that in this new age of atomic energy the United Nations Organization , as now constituted , is a weak reed on which to lean , and that if the American people believe that it has in it a sufficiently stout staff it is laboring under a dangerous delusion . The eighteen in their statement said : " What the Dublin statement would accomplish , if accepted by a large number of people , would be to sow disillusionment and uncertainty in the minds of the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be wiser to face the facts , however disconcerting they may be ? CONRAD lioRBIL Boston , Oot. 29 , 1945 . British Wives Ask Ships Delay in Joining Husbands Here Ham Caused Grief and Hardship To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : We are writing to you on behalf of the thousands of British wives of American service men who are awaiting shipping to bring them to the United States to join their demobilized husbands . We fear that the majority of Americans do not appreciate the hardship caused to these , their own fighting men , among the first to be discharged because of their long overseas war service , by still having to wait indefinitely to set up the homes they have earned , and meantime having to maintain themselves in the United States and their wives and children in Britain out of one civilian wage . We are reluctant to believe that it is really the feeling of the American people that these men should wait until all the rest of the American soldiers are home before they can begin normal civilian lives . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Britain sought nothing at the expense of American service men . Having been all too close themselves to the rigors of war , they appreciate what these men have had to endure and seek only to give welt merited happiness to those who hon. ored them with marriage . They be-. lieve it is not beyond the powers of the responsible authorities to find a compromise whereby those men whose wives wait in America and those whose wives wait in Britain may be treated with equal fairness . We would point out that in countless cases here , as in America , wives have not seen their American husbands for one , two and even three years , and there are many children whose fathers ? now civilian again  --  have never seen them . Here in Britain are 20,000 children of Anglo-American marriages  --  Americans every one of them . Yet they must wait for their American heritage while ships sail daily from Britain and the Continent to American ports laden with now useless war equipment . May we add that to fit ourselves for our future as co-builders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can about American history , culture and habits . We have learned much , too , from the Americans who past : through Britain during the last three and a half years , with the result tha ' we already feel part of your country . CATHERINE DOWER , FRANCES RHODES . Manchester , England , Oct. 23 , 1945 . Misunderstanding Seems Apparent To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The article in the financial sectic of Oct. 28 , " The Fetish of Full Employment , " interested me greatly . Th. - writer , Henry Hazlitt , apparently not realize that severe unemploymen ' is the greatest danger to the economic system which " has been getting mor production with the same labor . " The ' system came too close to being de . stroyed in the unemployment of th 1930 's to make it comfortable for us to look back on that period . We woulo like to forget it if we could . Our unsolved problem is to COLI " : : * : - high production and high employmen : rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americar business men to rally to that till : rather than setting production ark employment off against each other Unless we do apply ourselves to the : task , we are preparing the defeat o ' the institutions to which we rends ; such fervid lip service . RALPH G. FLANDERS . Boston , Oct. 29 , 1945 . Mr. Hazlitt informs us that he 1-sorry Mr. Flanders managed to mi , understand his article so completel : He did not set off production and en employment against each other . He not say that we must choose betw : the two . He said that production is qv end , and employment merely the means He tried to say that full employmen must be subordinated to full produc tion , not vice versa , and that to rever .. , this relationship of means to ends lead us into a hundred absurdities al : a hundred nonsensical policies. ?
