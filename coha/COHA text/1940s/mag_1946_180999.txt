The West Coast last week quietly celebrated the marriage of the world 's biggest steel company to the nation 's largest surplus plant . And it had the blessing of Attorney General Tom C. Clark . U.S. Steel Corp . bought the $190 million Geneva Steel plant for $47,500,000 . Big Steel will sink another $25 million in expanding its western subsidiary , Columbia Steel , along with $18.6 million in Geneva itself . <P> In this way the Administration , which has posed as the foe of bigness in business , settled one of the hottest politico-economic questions of the year in favor of bigness . <P> The issue boiled down to this : Should Geneva go to a subsidy-free private operator , i.e. , Big Steel , with the overtones of monopoly this entailed , or to a small company dependent on some kind of Government subsidy ? Tom Clark held that , since U.S. Steel and Geneva together will produce only 32.7% of the nation 's steel capacity , the combination can not be called monopolistic . <P> But inside the Department of Justice there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bethlehem Steel will control about 45% of the nation 's capacity , 75% of the West Coast 's supply . They have the power to exclude and control West Coast competition if they wish . Their position is roughly the same as that of the Big Three of tobacco ( TIME , June 24 ) which the Supreme Court held were a monopoly . <P> In the far West itself , reaction was largely of the wait- &-see; variety . General Manager Louis Lundberg of the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce commented : " In the long run the West Coast will have more abundant steel and finally cheaper steel . " But Denver Post Editor E. Palmer Hoyt came closer to what was in the public mind . Said he : " . . . Westerners now should back the Attorney General with watchfulness against any attempt at monopolistic practices . " <P> In short , if the monopoly in theory becomes a monopoly in fact , and the West does not get cheaper steel , it will be Tom Clark 's fault .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
