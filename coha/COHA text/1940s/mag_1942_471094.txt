sr before I left France to try my luck across the Channel in London , an old French musician gave me some chilling advice . " Do n't be misled by the success young Mischa Elman had there . He was a ' prodigy ' ; but you wear long pants . London takes quickly to the very young or to the very old . You are neither ; you are merely a callow youth whose talent will be scrutinized with a kind of refrigerating tolerance . " His prediction was painfully true . At my first English concert , in November , 1906 , there was applause and there were encores , and in the crowded greenroom afterward there were even some extravagant compliments . But somehow I knew it had not quite clicked . Nor was I consoled the following morning by what my manager assured me was a " brilliant " press . There were plenty of usable lines ? excellent quotations for the box office , my manager said ; but even here there was a reticence , a qualification . The French musician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citadel to he carried by assault ? at least not by me . Nevertheless there were many side doors to success , modest but satisfying , which were generously opened to me , so I did not lack opportunities to he heard . Sometimes with fees , more often without , I played in the provinces and in drawingrooms , slowly making progress in the campaign . My most important engagement was with the London Symphony Orchestra for their regular series . The conductor was to be that renowned and almost legendary figure , Hans Richter . Hans Richter ! What a name to conjure with ! I felt myself suddenly linked with the illustrious past . Had he not been the friend of Brahms , the friend and apostle of Wagner ? Had not " Die Meistersinger " had its first hearing under his baton ? Richter asked me to play the SaintSatins concerto , which was , I thought , a very French work for so German a musician to choose . Later I was to discover that the choice of both violinist and concerto had been inspired by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French master , with whom I had played in Florence , had been as good as his word . " Rest assured , " he had told me , " that I shall not forget to spread good reports of your playing . " Though the concerto was of course well in my fingers , I nevertheless spent many hours recleaning , repolishing the work . Yesterday 's " good enough " would never do for to-morrow 's ordeal . That is always the way with a fresh test , a new challenge to endeavor . And as the morning of rehearsal approaches you are much more easily assailed by doubt than you are fortified by conviction . Conviction often returns by the evening concert but is invariably a truant at rehearsal . Richter was formidable-looking . He growled rather than spoke his " Good morning " in reply to my timid salutation . He had a head , I thought , somewhat like Socrates ' . But he could n't have had a Xanthippe for a wife else he 'd have had gentle manners . His reddish-brown hair and beard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to have been shoved into slovenly shape by very blunt instruments . It had the effect of unfinished masonry . It did not invite assurance . The opening of the concerto is dangerous : bold strokes of the bow ? a vigorous theme proclaimed dangerously in the high register of the G string . My bow arm felt shaky and my left hand seemed to have mislaid its security . I felt miserably and woefully inadequate . I fully expected Richter to condemn me harshly to oblivion . However , I kept on and after a few unsteady and unpromising phrases things were going better . By the time I had reached the sub-theme the violin was singing reassuringly , and as I successfully negotiated the flight to a high harmonic , there was an unmistakable grunt of approval to the left of me . From then on it was smooth sailing and at the end of the rehearsal Richter was actually jovial . The concert wcnt excellently and the well-filled Queen 's Hall audience was prodigal with its applause . The press too was quite extravagant with its praise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play with him in Manchester . He was at that time conducting the old orchestral society so long associated with Sir Charles Haile . But the Manchester concert was a frosty disappointment . The concerto went less brilliantly than in London , yet it had , I thought , its respectable points and was hardly deserving of the blast of condemnation that greeted it . The shades of Sarasate and Lady Half ( Norma Neruda ) were apparently at the elbows of all the scribes reporting the concert , reminding them just how I had failed in this or that phrase to approach their own unforgettable performances in this same concerto . Richter found me the following morning half hiding myself in a dark corner of the hotel lobby miserably reading and rereading the uncornforting news . It was a gloomy morning . Richter lost his temper with me . " So ! " he exclaimed , " so I find you wasting your time . The papers they are bad ? so you are unhappy . Another time they arc good ? so you are happy . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an artist . Perhaps you think newspaper print more important than my opinion ! " Somehow I found his irritation more stimulating than a tonic and managed to say so . He went on in a kindlier tone . " Do n't read notices ! Let your manager do that . That is part of his business . It is not part of the artist 's business . " I murmured something of my realization that I had played less well than in London . " Yes , " Richter agreed , " it was better in London . It is good that you know it . But it was not bad last night . A musician is not a machine , Gait sei Dank . If one were always sure of the same thing performance would lose life , lose interest . Those fools " ? pointing disdainfully to the mass of strewn papers ? " see only the things on the surface . They are superficial . Do n't read them . " " But , " I dared to point out , " you , Master , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a quick sidelong glance and I wondered if an explosion were coming . Then , with as near an approach to a smile as the old round head could make : " Yes , Esel that I am , I did read them . They spoiled my breakfast . Na Let us have a cup of coffee and forget it . It will be bad English coffee , but perhaps it will be hot . " Yes , decidedly old Richter was a comfort that morning . The coffee they brought us looked like treacle , thick and syrupy , and tasted worse . Richter philosophized on the unmusicality of those countries that had n't the proper appreciation of the coffee bean . Germany , Austria , Holland , the Scandinavian countries , Finland , even Russia ? all excellent lands for excellent coffee . Music flourishes . England , France , Italy , Spain , Belgium , miserable coffee . Music languishes . I longed to point out some notable exceptions , but forbore . We journeyed back together to London . He told me many anecdotes of Olympian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With a kind of Homeric simplicity he brought these Gods to earth , humanizing them . Little personal details , weaknesses even , rubbing shoulders with unapproachable exploits . " Do you play the Brahms concerto ? " he asked . I had studied it but never yet tried it publicly . " Do n't play it too soon , " he advised . " Above all when you do play it do n't be too impressed by its reputation of having been written gegen die Geige . It is written far , not against , the violin and one day ? perhaps I shall not live to see it ? will be as popular as the Mendelssohn . " I could hardly believe it , but was not disposed to question his prophecy . The ncxt evening he invited me to Covent Garden to hear his performance of " Meistersinger . " Compared to today 's smoother , more manicured exposition of this mighty score , there were many rough and uncouth deliveries . It certainly had not been sufficiently rehearsed to have elegance or perfection of detail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than was to prevail later . I was , however , profoundly moved by this great tapestry of sound . It still remains for me Wagner 's uniquely successful opera wherein the imperative and compelling action depicted in the music is not in almost constant conflict with the inertia of a paralytic stage ? that conflict between eye and ear that all but ruins my enjoyment of his other music dramas . I went backstage to see and thank Richter for the beautiful evening he had given me . " Na , " he said , and he was in a very bad humor , " it was not a good performance . The overture , yes ! The quintet , yes ! The rest , it was badvery bad . Yet , " he added with a kind of sardonic humor , " sec the critiques in the morning . They will be very fine . That is because I am old and have a beard . " He stroked my chin . " Grow a beard ! You will see what an easy way it is to eminence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raving honeyed phrases over what it found to be flawless perfection ! II The Gordons , whom I often visited during my stay in England , had for years made their home a rendezvous for musicians , writers , and painters . Henry Evans Gordon was about my father 's age , a blond , ruddy-skinned Englishman with a genuine enthusiasm for music . When very young he had married May Sartoris . Her mother was the lovely Adelaide Kemble whose fame on the operatic stage had threatened to rival and even outdistance her sister Fanny 's acclaim as an actress . The Gordons passed half their time in London , the other half in a lovely old country house hidden away in Kent . There I used often to be invited for a week-end . I was thoroughly unprepared for the rituals and protocols of my first visit to an English country house , unprepared to run the gauntlet of appraisal to which that highly evolved and snobbish Elite , British servants , subject one . It proved a sore test to my morale and confidence . There were ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling an intimacy that is absent from every other English meal . How had it gone with Richter ? I must tell them everything . I emphasized London ( of which they had heard ) and minimized Manchester ( those ghosts of northern disapproval seemed so out of key with this pleasant interior ) . Besides Mr. and Mrs. Gordon , three of their daughters , and myself , there were several young men , perhaps prospective suitors , and Vivien Scovel , a pretty cousin on the American side of the Sartoris family ( her mother had been Nellie Grant ) . Their conversation reflected a rich life ? literary , musical , political . Musically , the Gordons were pro-German ; politically , pro-French . The recent Entente initiated and promoted by the King had their enthusiastic sanction . Many in England disapproved of this reversal of timehonored traditions and shook their heads as if to say , " This could not have happened under the Queen ! " But such doubts had no place in the Gordon house . I was constantly to be reminded of their American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so proudly of them . Did I know their cousin Owen Wister ? I did n't , but was glad to say that I had read and liked his book The Virginian . Lloyd George was a junior politician one was then beginning to hear about . Once his name was introduced in conversation it was never uttered again ; subsequently he was referred to only as " that man . " He had , it seemed , been proposing unspeakable things , unheard-of changes , in the House of Commons ; he was not to be tolerated . I thought it all sounded very definite and convincing . Dinner transformed the household . The sober tweeds of the afternoon had been replaced by the resplendent satins and velvets of the opulent Edwardian age . Ostrich feathers abounded . They were worn round the neck ; they bordered the wide flounces of a skirt ; they towered in stately dignity above the already lofty pompadours then in vogue . The dining room was gay , decorative , cordial . But somehow the intimacy of the tea table had departed . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier , yet I felt we should all have to get acquainted again . " ' Ock hor claret , sir ? " asked an unfamiliar voice behind my shoulder . Not knowing for a moment what " ' ock " was , I asked for claret . It was clearly the wrong thing to do , for we had n't yet finished with fish . Mr. Gordon re-MAGAZINE paired the trouble . " Would n't you rather , Albert , " he said kindly , " have a bit of white wine first with your fish ? " I would , of course I would . But why offer a choice ? It seemed one of those unanswerable riddles that social usage is always presenting . After dinner , taking my courage in hand , I asked Mr. Gordon this very question . The tiny lines at the corner of his eyes contracted quizzically . " That , " he said , " is a mystery ? one of those mysteries no one must attempt to pierce . It is part of a game between masters and servants . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game . They can not lose . We can not win . It is hallowed by tradition . And it is such a consolation to them . Doubtless the next time you are asked you will not fall into the trap . Never mind . The butler will be intent on his next victim . " It was , I thought , not unlike a certain system of hazing . At breakfast the next morning Mr. Gordon had a pleasant surprise for me . He had just recently heard from Joachim . The venerable master was , it appeared , to be in Berlin during the time of my forthcoming visit there . " I had thought , " said Mr. Gordon , " to give you a letter of introduction to him . But I am tempted to go along with you for your concert in Berlin . Perhaps a personal introduction would be better . Should you like that ? " No need to answer . My delight was evident . " Very well then . It is settled . " III Joachim did not attend my Berlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was to play for him . It was an exciting moment . Mr. Gordon and I arrived punctually at the appointed hour . Joachim received us with great kindness . It was evident that he had a deep and devoted affection for Mr. Gordon . Joachim 's command of English was perfect , which was fortunate for me , as my German was lame and halting . " And what , " he asked , " will you play ? " I had a number of pieces for him to choose from ? the Bruch G minor concerto , the Bach Chaconne , the Devil 's Trill by Tartini . " In fact , an entire recital , " said Joachim , smiling . " Play them well and we shall listen to a recital . " Having previously seen him only on the stage , I was surprised to find how short he was . The stage has a deceptive way of adding stature to those who tread its boards . Joachim was short and stocky . A leonine head and shoulders seemed to have mislaid their proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totally inadequate one . It was , I thought , utterly wrong to be looking down , rather than up , to so much greatness . " You have just recently played with Richter , " he remarked ; " how did it go ? " I was happy to give him a glowing account of the London concert . " Did the old bear growl at you ? He generally does ! " " Only with the greatest kindness , " I hastened to reply . " That means he liked it , " pronounced Joachim . " Richter is not famed for kindness . Nor does he put any brakes on his displeasure . He lets it run down hill . Now play me some of the Bruch concerto . " I did . I played all of it . Joachim listened intently . He was pleased , but he was critical too . " The opening martial passage of the Finale ! It is too tame . There must be a quick full sweep of the bow arm for that tonic chord . The whole arm . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rush . Here ? give me your violin ! " Impetuously he attacked the passage . The result was not impeccable . Tired old limbs racked with rheumatism were rebels to his intention . The bow rushed in a bold sweep , but it slipped , and my Montagnana violin snarled in return . Joachim immediately repeated the same phrase , this time ? I noted ? with a little more deliberation and with thrilling effect . " Now , " he said , " you do it . " I did . I was never thereafter to do it otherwise . He had me play on and on , many other things ? in fact it was a full recital . He would not listen , however , to the Bach air which Wilhelmj had transcribed for the G string . Wilhelmj was , it was only too evident , one of his pet dislikes . " He has an immense tone , " said Joachim , " which he misuses with a disgusting effect . His violin playing amazes but tires me . It is never natural . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shout or to sob . One can bear to hear them only in a place as large as the Colosseum . " Joachim sent us on our way rejoicing with high praise . He was , however , deaf to my plea that I should study with him . " No , " he said , " the only way you could do that would be to enter the Hochschule in the regular way . I no longer give private instruction . If you entered the Hochschule I should of course have you in my class . But I do not advise it . Your course is already charted . Your career has begun . Stick to it . Above all , you have character in your playing . Your playing sounds likeyou ? and that is rare . I do not mean that you have not much to learn . But from this time on it is what you develop in yourself that will be of value . Please , please always keep that simplicity of approach . It is really the shortest cut from mind to mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was time for us to be going . Joa-chim bowed us out . He was standing close to the admirable portrait that Sargent had recently painted of him . The room was furnished with unbelievably garish French furniture , of the type that must have been dear to the heart of Frederick the Great . An incredible profusion of the most useless kind of bibelots littered every table and crowded every cabinet that flanked the walls ? such artificial surroundings for so direct and simple a soul . Only the realistic and lifelike portrait seemed to bear a relationship to the man standing beneath it . It was the last time I was to see Joachim , and the only time I was to meet him . His death was announced a few months later . Shortly after our return to London I was invited to appear as instrumental soloist at a concert to be given by the Royal Amateur Orchestra . This organization had been formed by one of Queen Victoria 's numerous sons , the Dukc of Edinburgh , who was himself a violinist of sorts and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was customary for the King to attend one of these concerts ( called smokers ) each year , and this year he was to attend the concert at which I was to play . The evening came . I was repeatedly and carefully coached as to how I was to bow , first to Royalty and then to the general audience . The Queen 's Hall had been quite transformed . The first few rows of orchestra stalls had been removed to allow a semi-circular line of gilt fauteuils to be installed . In the very center sat Edward VII . On one side of him sat the Prince of Wales , who was later to have the unique distinction of being the first monarch to make the name of George palatable to the British . ( It had been until then too gloomily associated with Hanoverian heaviness or a Regent 's profligacy . ) It was an impressive sight . The dazzling costumes of members of the diplomatic corps mingled with bright uniforms . To be in a plain dress suit , unadorned by decorations , seemed downright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole of it would have tried royal patience too far . It was not an impressive performance . The orchestral background was ragged and rough and many were the times when I speculated whether to press on with the strings or lag back with the wood-winds . Often there was a discrepancy of a beat or more between these two unneighborly groups which I tried unsuccessfully to bridge . The Adagio seemed to me of an interminable length . I was playing , I thought , not too badly , but the ensemble was lamentable . The King , sitting not ten paces away , bore up right regally . He was a sovereign figure . Resplendent in knee breeches of black satin , the bright ribbon of the Order of the Garter all but hiding his shirt front , he composedly endured such boredom as kings are heir to . Once or twice the heavy eyelids would raise themselves with an expectant hope . Did that last cadence promise the end ? It did n't , and the eyelids would settle again . It was a consolation to note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ennui . Next to him the Prince of Wales likewise fortified himself with a cigar ? less long , less regally handled . The sailor prince seemed to be a long way away from the style of kingship patterned by his father . The concerto finally ended . The last movement had gone with a considerable amount of zest and ragged brio and the applause was generous , the King and the Prince politely joining in . It must have been such a comfort to have it over . The group of violin solos with piano that was to come in the second half of the program promised by their titles to be engagingly brief . There was Schumann 's Melody in the Garden and a whimsical trifle by Francois ( not to be confused with Franz ) Schubert , called The Bee . This fleeting bit of fingerwork , which lasted but a minute , I had heard Fritz Kreisler recently play as encore with his customary bewitching effect . I used it on all dangerous occasions . It was never , however , to enjoy its real fame until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and canonized by recognition from the unique Jack Benny . I speak only of those more modest days when it was played by violinists . Anyway the two small pieces did their work with gratifying results , and the evening was finally over . It had I reflected , been a very dull one , but it was recorded in the morning papers in detail , and at a length denied to many better events . It even commanded the cables of the Associated Press . Clearly in the Edwardian age it was important to pass a dull evening in the company of a King . During these years my family spent the summers as usual at Monmouth Beach on the Jersey coast , and the end of June , 1908 , found us there again . The original little frame house of 1890 , two storeys high , had swelled to twice or three times its initial size . An extra floor , a tower here , an ell there , an extension on all sides had made of it an unrecognizable but still lovable monstrosity . The rooms inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's day . We were never anything less than a crowded household , yet there appeared to be no congestion . Mental and physical ventilation abounded . My brother Boardman had just graduated from Yale and was to enter the Harvard Law School in the autumn . He had fallen in love with a young lady , pretty as a spring flower . They were not engaged officially , but there was a subtle current of post-adolescent romanticism flowing fluidly between them . In August I had an invitation to visit Walter Damrosch in York Harbor . I had never met him , but my American debut the following November was to be with the New York Symphony Orchestra , of which he was the permanent conductor . Damrosch himself met me at the station . It was early morning and I was yet groggy with sleep , having allowed but a bare quarter of an hour for transition from sleeping berth to station platform . But the welcome was cordial , and soon I was happily at home with all the Damrosches ? Walter , Margaret , and four daughters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in his mellow forties , was remarkably handsome . He had the vigor and flexibility of youth coupled with an irresistible geniality of manner . Mrs. Damrosch , not less cordial , was , however , somewhat reserved at first . Not for nothing was she James G. Blaine 's daughter . She had a genius for hospitality , but close intimacy was a jealously guarded treasure not easily or immediately to be gained . We talked of my debut numbers . At the first concert I was to play the Saint-Saens B minor concerto , and two days later the Tschaikowsky . Damrosch had heard directly from SaintSaens concerning me . " A wonderful old man , " he commented , " a great wit , a caustic critic , an astute politician ( without portfolio , it 's true ) , an admirable organist , and an amazing pianist . His main job ? composing ? would almost be forgotten amid this catholic array of talents were it not that lie is so good at it . He has admirers and acquaintances all over the world , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Saint-Sa6-is does n't write enthusiastically unless he means it . " This was all very cheering , but I can remember glancing somewhat apprehensively out of the window at the grim Maine fog that was rising from the sea . That stealthy enemy to fiddle strings is as menacing to the violinist as an attack of laryngitis to the singer . It 's no use , I thought somewhat desperately ; he 's sure to ask me to play as soon as breakfast is over . Why did I come to-day ? Why did I come at all ? And above all ? why a fog ? Damrosch , however , had heart and understanding . He did not propose music ? bless him ! Instead , we all went for a drive in the newly acquired family car . The younger girls , Gretchen , Polly , and Anita ( then little more than a baby ) , crowed with delight . We were seven or eight in the car , but cars were built in those days for capacity . There were several miles of firmly packed sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the incredible rate of forty miles an hour . It was breathlessly exhilarating . The car was an open one , built long before the effeminate days of windshields , so that you met honestly , face on , the rush of wind seasoned with an occasional spray of sand and salt water . Back home again , Damrosch went to the piano . It was an upright and not too good a one at that , but the amazing man contrived to make it sound well . He had some scores in manuscript which had recently been sent him . I have always had an admiration mixed with awe for the musician who can read with facility from an orchestral score . With Damrosch it seemed to be second nature . I have rarely seen his power in this field duplicated . The fog lifted after an hour or so , and then he suggested that we play together . Apparently he was delighted with the way the Saint-Saens went , in spite of the fact that I had to use my fifty-dollar practice fiddle whose clear but rather blatant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mellow and seasoned voice of my Montagnana . During the next few days we played often . Sometimes a few friends came in to listen . It was a happy visit and was the beginning of a fast and faithful friendship . Damrosch did everything he could to set the stage for a triumphal New York debut . Although I did not know it until later , he busied himself writing letters for publication which contained the warmest praise of my playing . I was , he wrote , " the first great instrumentalist this country has produced , " and he was willing to stake his reputation on my fulfilling every high expectation . There was , however , to ensue a long period before there should be any general acceptance of this heart-warming accolade . Public favor , I was to find , does not in one 's homeland come running at the first bid for it . November 8th came . It was a Sunday afternoon . Carnegie Hall was filled . There was excitement mixed with skepticism running like a kind of electrical current throughout the audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was nervous ; more nervous perhaps than I had ever been previously or was again to be in the future . Under such circumstances no artist can be a correct judge of what his performance has been , but I shall venture the judgment that it had quality , marred here and there by outward blemishes . Itwas neither my best nor my worst performance . The dangerous opening of the concerto , punctuated by daring shifts of position on the G string , suffered from over-attack and doubtful intonation . After the first page or so things went better . My confidence returned . Results were no longer halting . The hazardous harmonics at the close of the second movement were successfully negotiated , and the finale went brilliantly . The main part of the audience , after preliminary hesitation , took heart at these latter proceedings and the spontaneous burst of applause that continued through a number of recalls would have satisfied any performer . My friends and well-wishers were elated . It was , they pronounced , a highly successful debut . Damrosch said : " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel far and wide ! " But he and the others had reckoned without considering what a damaging morning press could do . Few debuts evoking such enthusiastic applause can have elicited such withering blasts of scornful demolition as came from the pen of the dean of New York critics . His name was Krehbiel and he wrote for the Tribune . He had a powerful pen and he used it pungently on this occasion . Of all " rasping , raucous , snarling , unmusical sounds " which he had ever been subjected to , mine were apparently the worst . He recalled that another American violinist preceding me had recently sought to promote publicity by insinuating that he had been lost in the Alps ? only to be miraculously rescued shortly afterward . What connection this item had with me I am not sure , but I gathered that the authoritative arbiter of musical opinion was suggesting that my future be consigned to oblivion a per-manent , not temporary , disappearance in the Alps . I still have Krehbiel 's initial estimate of me . It is a unique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they felt to be genuine talent . And if some of them tempered admiration with qualifying criticism , all of them reflected , in some measure at least , the excited enthusiasm that had pervaded Carnegie Hall the day before . It became evident , however , that Krehbiel 's notice constituted news ? whereas the others did n't . His vituperations seemed to spread like poison gas , but with the speed of electricity . Indeed , one of my agent 's rivals made it his business to circulate throughout the country numerous copies of that particular issue of the New York Tribune , November 9 , 1908 . What he expected to gain by this questionable procedure I am to this day not sure . Perhaps he figured that if every contract under negotiation for Spalding were abandoned there would be chances for more dates for his own particular candidate . At all events the paradoxical result of the wide broadcasting of Krehbiel 's condemnation was to project me into the full glare of public notice . It gained me as many friends as it did opponents and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violently and exaggeratedly enthusiastic as my detractors were damning ; I found myself noted , perhaps in advance of being noteworthy . Damrosch called me on the telephone that depressing Monday morning . He wished to console me . Had I read Krehbiel 's notice ? I had n't , though I knew about it . " I am glad to hear it , " said Damrosch . " Do n't read it ? it 's vindictive , it 's vicious , and it 's untrue . I meant what I said yesterday . You are a ship in full sail ! Krehbiel , " he went on , " is an old friend of mine . He is an ardent lover and student of music . He writes well . And he is uncompromisingly sincere . But as far as you are concerned he is prejudiced , mistaken , and all-fired wrong . Keep on playing and you will prove him so . " My manager in those days was R. E. Johnston , a unique figure . Minus oneleg , bereft of teeth , and with a high cracked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely an attractive personality to meet . Moreover , his reputation was not altogether enviable . Irresponsibility , unreliability , unsound business practices ? all these things were charged against him . It was said , in fact shouted from the housetops , that he had only taken on my management because of immense sums of money paid him by my father . In justice to Johnston 's memory and , incidentally , to my father 's good sense , let me state that this was absolutely untrue . Johnston took me under his management on a regular commission basis . He undertook to get me profitable concerts , his share to be fifteen per cent of the gross fee of each concert ? no more , no less . Whether the more fantastic and doubtful procedure took place with other artists under his management I do not know . Johnston sincerely believed in my musical talent . He was a genuine music lover and many is the time , I believe , that he risked his shirt in a rnusical venture that had caught his fancy . His particular star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke of him there was such warmth in his cracked voice and such kindling enthusiasm in his tired eyes that he at once became lovable . Johnston had counted much on my first New York appearance . Perhaps he had overshot the mark in his preliminary advertising campaign of me . He was chagrined , disappointed , and bitterly resentful at the attack from Krehbiel . It had , you could see , shaken him , but he refused to be disheartened . He redoubled his efforts on my behalf , stoutly maintaining to those who contended that I had " not arrived " that I was on my way . " Not arrived , " he would croak , " o/ course he has n't arrived ! But that 's onlbecause he 's going so far that none r you 'll be able to see him . Pull up yot jeans and wait and see ! "
