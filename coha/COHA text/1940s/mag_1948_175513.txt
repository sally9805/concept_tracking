On March 21 , 1943 , Lieut . General Joseph W. Stilwell , Commander of the China-Burma-India Theater , Chief of Staff to Chiang Kaishek , wrote to his wife in Carmel , Calif . In the letter he enclosed the following verse : <P> Aromatic Chungking , where I welcomed the spring , <P> In a mixture of beauty and stenches , <P> Of flowers and birds , with a sprinkling <P> of - , <P> And of bowlegged Szechuan wenches . <P> <P> The contempt in those lines epitomizes the tragic failure of Vinegar Joe Stilwell , a brave soldier who broke his heart on a job a hundred times too big for him . The deeper tragedy was that Stilwell 's colossal failure contributed to the war-born misunderstanding between the U.S. and China ; a misunderstanding which has already brought a disaster to China and may have consequences for the U.S. as well . <P> Stilwell died a year and a half ago . Theodore H. White , a former TIME correspondent in Chungking , has assembled " Stilwell 's Story " from the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and random papers . The collection , edited and liberally annotated by White ( who shares Stilwell 's hatred of the Chinese government and his warm regard for the Chinese Communists ) , appeared this week in the current issue of the Ladies ' Home Journal . As if in answer , Major General Claire L. Chennault , who commanded the Fourteenth Air Force at Kunming under Stilwell , is writing his very different version of the tragic story for the Scripps-Howard newspapers . <P> More is involved than the warming over of an old feud between generals . Much of the present U.S. governmental and popular attitude toward China has been distilled out of Stilwell 's venom . <P> " I Let Them Rant . " In Washington 's confusion after Pearl Harbor , Stilwell almost got the assignment which would have developed into command of the North African expedition . If the acid of his insecure and suspicious personality had been poured over U.S.-British relations , calamity might have come more dramatically . Stilwell 's contempt was not confined to the Chinese government . In his diary and letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mountbatten and at Chennault , who had been in China four years before Stilwell got there . <P> Chennault says that Stilwell never once asked him to present an airman 's picture of the China war . Chennault believes that Stilwell 's initial defeat by the Japanese in Burma led to his obsession with the planning of a second Burma campaign which was to vindicate Stilwell 's military reputation . Chennault traces many of Stilwell 's mistakes in his relations with the Chinese to his preoccupation with the reopening of the Burma Road , which Chennault believes was a nearly valueless objective . Actually , the damage was done before the first Burma campaign . <P> For an American to operate effectively as Chiang Kai-shek 's Chief of Staff would have been a delicate operation at best . Stilwell in his diary quotes George Marshall as telling him , " Get the various factions together and grab command and in general give ' em the works . " Whether Marshall said that or not , that is the way Stilwell went about his task .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
