txt  | in fact , so wide that they might easily change the whole balance of power in the American system . They might change it , not merely as between the executive and the legislature , but within the elements of the executive itself . The failure to give the plan the consideration it deserves is not , I think , due to inertia , but rather , as Professor Cushman rightly suggests , 14 to " the vaguely uneasy feeling that the plan would unwisely upset the traditional and established relationship between the executive and legislative departments with consequences that can not be accurately foreseen and appraised . " Close analysis makes this at once apparent . If the cabinet is to sit in Congress , the president must choose its members from those who arc likely to be influential with it . This at once narrows his choice . It makes him think of the men who already have some standing in its eyes , and some direct knowledge of its complicated procedure . But this means putting a premium on the experienced members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the more successful they are upon the floor of Congress , the more independent they arc likely to be vis-a-vis the president . They will develop a status of their own as they become known as the men who are able to make Congress take their views about the bills they promote . They are likely , in fact , to become rivals of the president himself for influence with Congress . The problem , in this situation , of maintaining cabinet unity would necessarily become a difficult matter . Congress footnote 14 American National Government ( 1931 ) , p. 316.  | might easily tend to weaken the administration by playing off the cabinet , or some part of it , against the president and some other part . The loyalty of the cabinet officer would be divided . Is he , for example , to support the president on a scheme like the Court plan , and thereby to weaken his standing with Congress ; or is he discreetly to make known his dislike for the plan in the hope that he may thereby win approval for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's problem of changing his cabinet would , moreover , be immensely intensified . Is he to keep an officer about whose full loyalty he is dubious , but whose influence on Congress is clearly great ? Can he prevent such an officer 's so nearly rivaling his own authority as to make his own position exceptionally difficult ? Would not the position of a president like Lincoln , whose hold on his own colleagues was small when he assumed power , become virtually untenable if Congress were in a position to play them off against him ? Is there not , indeed , the danger of a powerful cabal of cabinet officers ' becoming the effective mediator between the president and Congress with a vital shift , as a consequence , in the present delicate balance of power ? Would it not , further , be likely that a tendency would rapidly develop for any cabinet officer who became outstandingly influential with Congress to become the rival of the president himself , and , where the latter was weak , in actual fact his master ? More than even this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tendency for the president to  | choose his cabinet from Congress in order to maximize his influence with it , and thus to transfer the leadership of his party there to a room , so to say , of which he only had the key . There would be a tendency for cabinet officers to use their relation with Congress as a platform from which to reach the presidency , with all the difficulties of colleagueship of this position , and more , that Polk emphasized . It is difficult , moreover , not to feel that , in these circumstances , the advice of the cabinet member upon questions of patronage would be given under conditions altogether different from and inferior to those upon which they now depend . The danger of trading posts for measures is already profound enough in the American system ; it is difficult not to feel that it would be greatly intensified if a cabinet officer were independent of the president in his power to influence Congress . The coherence that is now given to administrative action by the supremacy of the president might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheme suggested that cabinet members should have access to debates upon the floor of the I louse , . But in fact , the main business of Congress is performed in secret committees to which the public has no access . No cabinet officer could adequately look after his measures unless he penetrated the committee rooms also . But were he to do so , the control over him of the president would be still further diminished ; and the relation between him and Congress would rival in closeness that with the executive of which the president is the head . This seems scarcely  | desirable in a system where there is no collective cabinet responsibility , and where the unity of the executive structure is supplied by presidential control . In these circumstances , no cabinet member can be transformed into an automaton who merely reflects the presidential will . For first , in such a transformation as this innovation portends , he would have been chosen just precisely because he is not an automaton ; and second , to the degree that he seeks to act like one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are two further difficulties in the scheme , moreover , to which adequate attention has hardly been given in discussion of it . It raises most delicate and complicated questions of the relation between the cabinet officer , as a quasi-member of Congress , and the senator or congressman who is in charge of the bill in which he is interested . By whom is the concession to be made to a proposed amendment ? Flow will chairmanships be arranged so as to secure a proper harmony in congressional proceedings between the cabinet officer and the chairman of his committee ? On a bill , for example , like that of President Roosevelt 's Court plan , the position of the attorney-general would be well-nigh intolerable unless he were at one with the chairman of the Judiciary Committee . The fact is that , on the present system , where the chairmen of the important committees of both houses form a kind of quasi-executive within the two branches of the legislature , the position of cabinet officers would be impossible at every point where they disagreed with that quasi-executive . Either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inferiority for the sake of agreement , in which difficult questions of loyalty to the president would be involved ; or they would differ openly with the official chairmen of the legislative committees , in which case , they would greatly add , by that difference , to the burden the president had to carry . Nor is this all . The Pendleton scheme seems to assume that each cabinet officer is to sit in Congress merely in relation to his own department . But the categories of government are far from being as simple as this view would make them appear . The range of modern legislation makes the secretary of the treasury as ubiquitously relevant as the chancellor of the exchequer in relation to most government proposals . The interrelations of modern problems of defense make half the issues which arise matters of co-ordination to which the secretary of the treasury , the secretary of war , and the secretary of the navy are all relevant . On foreign affairs , every vital matter is at least a joint operation between the president and the secretary of state ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he affirmed that outlook for which he had prior approval from the president ; and in matters of supreme importance it is the president only whose attitude it is vital for Congress to know . There , as the Wilson administration makes clear , he supersedes the secretary of state far more emphatically than , in an analogous situation , the prime minister of England supersedes ( he rather supplements ) the foreign secretary . Similar difficulties  | arise as between the Departments of Commerce and Labor ; and the Department of Justice , especially in the context of prosecutions such as those under the Sherman Act , has a vital relation to many other departments . It is , in fact , difficult to see how any cabinet officer except the postmaster-general could be confined within any rigidly defined domain . In the result , most cabinet officers would ? whatever the system started as ? be bound to develop roving commissions of general relevance not very different from the part that a cabinet minister plays in the British I louse of Commons . It must , moreover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation does not lie , as with Great Britain , for effective purposes in the government only . No doubt a special pre-eminence attaches to bills which have , so to say , the imprimatur of the president . But the source of a good deal of important legislative action lies in the hands of individual senators and congressmen ; in this respect it is only necessary to remember how much has been done , often despite the administration , by men like the late Senator La Follette and by Senator Norris . It would be far from easy to adjust the delicate relations which would arise from this dual relationship , not least if i he president were in a minority in Congress . And if members of the cabinet were admitted only to the floor of both houses , they would , for the most part , miss the chance of participation in the pivotal consideration of bills ; while , if they were permitted their  | full share in the committee processes , the duality of leadership would create almost insoluble problems . The Pendleton scheme , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presidential system . The facts of American life have concentrated literally enormous power in the hands of the president ; and it is no doubt true that the exercise of this power produces , above all in a second term , grave congressional doubts of the wisdom of its extent . At some time in the tenure of a president with a majority , the accusation of autocracy is almost bound to arise . But the real outcome of the Pendleton scheme , or any variant upon it , would be , I think , to transfer the essential features of presidential leadership to the cabinet . Its operations in Congress would be bound , sooner or later , to become the axis upon which the authority of the administration turned . I believe , indeed , that properly to perform its function in Congress the cabinet would be bound to try and discover the terms upon which it could become a unity ; a unity , be it noted , not only against the Congress , but against the president also . The latter would be compelled to spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against colleagues who would have developed an interest and prestige at least parallel to his own , and , conceivably , different from it . None of them could fail to be aware that outstanding success in the handling of Congress was the highroad to the kind of reputation out of which a presidential nomination could be secured . Some of them , at least , would be bound to play for that nomination ; and the problem ,  | in those circumstances , of maintaining presidential supremacy would be at every point delicate and complicated . The real result , in a word , of the adoption of such a scheme as Senator Pendleton proposed would be very rapidly to transform the president into a person more akin to the president of the French Republic than to that of the United States . He could not avoid the certainty that his colleagues who became pivotal in Congress would soon become indispensable to him . He could hardly avoid the concentration of public attention upon their activities in Congress rather than upon his relations with it . He would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the sphere of influence that is at present his own . The man among them who became the congressional leader of the cabinet would soon become a figure akin in character and influence to the prime minister ; the president would be dependent upon him for every legislative move in the fulfilment of his program . Indeed , I think it not unlikely that the president would become rather the adviser than the master of the man to whom Congress looked for the formulation and defense of the presidential program ; he would be moved to second place . He would find it difficult to resist the pressure of a cabinet officer who was influential with Congress ; he might well jeopardize his own position if he asked for his resignation . A hostile ( : 0ingress might even play off the cabinet , or some sect ion of it , against him . On any showing , this is to say , the Pendleton  | scheme would wholly alter the balance of forces history has evolved in the American system of government . I do not say that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimate depends upon a comparison between the presidential and parliamentary systems that is here out of place . All I am concerned to argue is that latent in the scheme is a revolution in the historical conception of the presidency . As it now operates , the nation looks to the president for executive leadership , and , in the long run , circumstances make it difficult for that leadership to be found elsewhere . Such a scheme as Pendleton 's inherently threatens that authority . While it separates him from his cabinet , on the one hand , it builds a bridge between the cabinet and Congress , on the other ; and the president can not walk across that bridge . It gives the cabinet an interest against him , not only with the legislature , but also with the party . A generation which has seen the vice-president of the United States use his influence in Congress to intrigue against the president should have no difficulty in seeing what his position might become if to his influence were joined that of any considerable part of the cabinet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Congress are at odds , the former 's power of direct appeal to the nation makes the issue between them a clear one upon which public opinion can make up its mind . A cabinet that moved toward independence of him would make such a clarity of choice a difficult matter . It would , almost necessarily , divert a good deal of attention away from the case the president has to make . It would offer the  | possibility of great rewards to those about him who were prepared to risk the penalties of disloyalty to him . Anyone who reflects upon the position that might have arisen if Stanton had been able to utilize Congress as a platform against Andrew Johnson can see the potentialities that arc latent in this change . It may be , as I have said , that it should be attempted ; for it may well be that the burden which the present situation imposes upon the president is greater than any statesman , above all in a democratic community , should be asked to bear . But the change should not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the historic contours of the presidential system . It may not , in the first instance , transform it on the lines of the parliamentary system ; it is bound , I have argued , in the long run to move it toward those lines . It can not do so , on all experience , without two results . It must first depreciate the position of the man who can not directly influence the congressional process ; those , to use my earlier metaphor , are bound to be nearer to it who cross the bridge than those who stay on the other side . And if men are sought who can influence Congress , men are bound to be sought by whom Congress is prepared to be influenced . That does not only mean the device of a different kind of cabinet officer from those of the past . It means also , in the long run , men who realize that the way to influence a legislative assembly is to be responsive to its will ; and that is the first step toward responsibility to its wishes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American Constitution . It is to make  | it desirable to build a cabinet which can sway Congress . That makes the main lever of executive authority resident in the cabinet rather than in the president . While this may be a better scheme than the present one , its possible merits can not conceal the fact that it is a constitutional revolution of the first magnitude . It is to dig into the foundations of the state ; and that , as Edmund Burke insisted , is always a dangerous adventure .  | UNDER all normal circumstances , it is difficult not to feel that the president of the United States must envy the legislative position of a British prime minister . The latter is the head of an assured parliamentary majority ; unless he has made a grave blunder , it is nowadays the electorate , and not Parliament , which destroys his measures . He and his cabinet have the effective initiative in all legislation , above all in finance ; and they do not find it necessary , save on t he rarest occasions , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest he need consult in the making of , appointments ; there is unlikely to be serious question even about those of which there are grave doubts among his followers . He takes the fundamental part in the definition of all issues . While he remains prime minister , he is the unquestioned master of his party machine . He is , moreover , the master of the House of Commons through his power over its dissolution ; he decides when the moment is propitious for an election . He is unlikely to retire from the leadership of his party except at his own discretion ; footnote : n l t the fact that he will lead it to the polls means , nor-  | mally , the nearer the approach of a general election , the more complete will be his power over his party . No doubt , over a period , the condition of his hold is that he shall be successful ; but , granted that he can lead it to victory once in a decade , he has little reason to fear the emergence of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British practice has traced , there is a wide divergence from the presidential situation . The president is never the master of Congress , except in relatively brief intervals of emergency . He does not know that it will accept his principles of action ; as Polk insisted , ' and as Franklin Roosevelt has learned , even a great majority in both houses is no guarantee of his control . He may not even have a nominal majority , and , in that event , he can be sure that the main purpose of Congress will be to discredit his administration . Ile can not exercise over either house the threat of dissolution ; whether he will or no , its elections are determined by a time-table over which he has no say . I Ic may influence the choice of congressional leaders but he can not determine them ; all the prestige of Franklin Roosevelt only enabled Senator Barkley to succeed Senator Robinson by a single vote . There is no continuous power to secure disciplined voting ; and Mr. Coolidge found that a small number of recalcitrant legislators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cabinet directly participate in the work of Congress ; they are dependent upon legislators whose own view of the wise course 1 Cf. my Parliamentary Government in England ( 1938 ) , pp. 239-241. 2 Op. cit. , p. 186.  | to follow is not less important than theirs . He can , no doubt , exercise some discipline over rebels in his own party ; but the attempted " purge " of 1938 makes it clear that this authority reaches but a little way . He may initiate legislation ; and he can be sure that a respectful attention will be given to his proposals . But he will always find that there arc , in either house , perhaps half a dozen men with independent authority to promote legislation independently of him . I le can be sure , too , that whatever his convenience , either house , or both houses , will spend a considerable part of their energies investigating his administration ; and unlike the British prime minister , he will be largely unable to determine to his own advantage the composition of the investigating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party , and , while in office , the chief factor in the operation of its machine , the knowledge that in eight years at most he will have ceased to be president profoundly limits his power to determine the uses to which it shall be put . To grasp the difference between the two systems , it is essential to bear certain points in mind . The I louse of Commons is only formally a legislative assembly ; in this context its real business is to act as the cabinet 's organ of registration . It may secure minor amendments ; it may even , on rare occasions , secure the withdrawal of a proposal . But , fundamentally , legislation is shaped in Whitehall , and not in Westminster . With Congress , this is not the case . Legislation is the main business of both houses . They do not act under the instructions of the president ; they may  | co-operate with him if they feel so inclined . But they arc at every point , save in periods of grave crisis , equal partners with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than he , are likely to have their way . He has , of course , the right of veto ; but that is rather a reserve weapon of last instance than one of habitual use . It is , indeed , true to say that the influential members of Congress have , in their legislative capacity , more power than any private members of any other legislative assembly in the world . This is the case for a number of reasons . It is inherent , in the first place , in the division of powers ; the founders of the Constitution did not intend the president to have authority to do more than indicate a general direction ; particularity was assumed to be the proper business of a legislature . It is the case , secondly , because Congress is the legislature of a continent rather than of a country in the European sense of the word . A nlcanbcr of Congress is expected , by reason of the vast size of the United States , to think in terms of sectional not less than national interests . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be considered upon the character of the particular area for which he sits ; and what he believes ( sometimes wrongly ) to be its will , may not infrequently cut across the will of the administration . A member of the House of Representatives must be constantly aware that every two years he will be judged by his constituents ; and this makes him far more responsive to his judgment of what will please them than he is likely to be to what will satisfy the president . For him , normally , the local  | issue and its repercussions are likely to seem far more acute than the national , not least if the outcome of the next primary is at all seriously in dispute . A congressman , moreover , whose fate may depend upon the judgment of a local boss ( in his turn , perhaps , the creature of an important public utility corporation ) is likely to feel that the advice of the boss is far more relevant to his future than that of the president . The members of Congress from the silver-producing states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , in the national interest , they saw no alternative but to accept the views of Wall Street upon the gold standard ; and a president who sought to enforce stringent legislation against lynching would find that he encountered a definitely particularistic view from Southern congressmen and senators . There is a real sense in which all but a handful of especially eminent senators , whose return to the Senate has become almost a tradition , may be regarded as members of " special areas , " for whose interests they must press , and to whose peculiarities they must yield , whatever be the outlook of the president and the party . It is important , thirdly , that the Congress has an interest separate from that of the president . No doubt the common tie of party binds them together ; but it is vital to realize that it never binds them into a unity . From the first presidency of Washington onward , Congress has made its will to independence apparent ; and only war , or an emergency like that of March , t 9 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Partly , it is a matter of pride ; the Congress must show  | that it takes its orders from none but itself . Partly , it is the realization that the life of the administration does not depend on its having its own way . Partly , no doubt , the individual congressman feels that he is more genuinely a person by enforcing his right to assert himself . For there is always a real fear in Congress of being overshadowed by the president . To enforce alterations is to draw attention to itself , to secure understanding that he is not the unqualified master of the nation . There can be no doubt that , in its own eyes , Congress establishes its prestige when it either refuses to let the president have his own way , or compels him to compromise with it . Unlike the House of Commons with the prime minister , it can do so without penalty . So far as possible , therefore , it likes to make every measure submitted to it a little different from the form in which it is received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , on occasion , it enhances its stature in the eyes of the electorate . There is always a pleasure in informing the head of the nation that there are limits to his power . The system , I think , makes both for incoherency and irresponsibility , not least in the realm of finance . It makes for the first because , whatever the effort the president may make , the legislation of any given Congress is not unified ; it does not derive from a single mind . Some measures are directly presidential in principle ; though it will be rare for them to have the exact form the president may wish to give them . Others may come from the will of an important senator who can count on the backing of his colleagues ; others ,  | again , may derive from a sectional group , irrespective of party , who demand them as the price of supporting other measures . Particularly in finance , where the American system forbids any real unity of control either in ways and means or in appropriation , the outlook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the measures Congress will pass ; and to this the budgetary system introduced nearly twenty years ago has made little difference . It is perhaps an exaggeration to say that the opinion of the chairman of the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce will , on a big railroad question , count as much as the opinion of the president ; but it is not , I think , an exaggeration to say that , where they differ , the Senate will compel the president to make sufficient of a compromise with its chairman to show that the senator has not been defeated by the presidential will . There is certainly no appropriations act which does not spend literally millions of dollars upon objectives the president does not approve and is compelled to accept as the price for securing other objectives about which he feels keenly . The system makes also for irresponsibility . Because the influences which go to make legislation are so diverse , there can be no clear allocation of blame . Each house of Congress can proceed upon its own lines ; only too often , they evolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the legislation which the president intended . There are , too , measures of considerable importance , like that , for instance , relating to the soldiers ' bonus , which Congress will pass in defi-  | ance of the presidential veto simply because it dare not risk the unpopularity a powerful lobby like the American Legion may seek to organize against it . It will yield to sudden gusts of ignorant temper . The Reorganization Bill of 1938 , for example , ( which it passed in substantially similar form in 1939 ) was defeated largely as the result of indefensible propaganda which represented it , quite inaccurately , as a vast enlargement of presidential power . If it be true that the British member of Parliament obeys too rigidly the crack of his party whip , it is still more true that the member of Congress is prone to an anarchism about the substance of measures for which there is no defense . The " pork barrel " legislation of the last century is the measure of this anarchism . Without regard to the problems the president confronts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests for which , quite unjustifiably , the taxpayer has been called upon to pay . Much the same is true of pensions ; much the same is true of the tariff ; much the same is true of agricultural measures like the McNaryHaughen bill . The separation of powers erodes responsibility by dividing it ; and the result is not only an immense increase of the costs of government . It is also a temptation to a weak president to evade the responsibility of leadership . This was true , very notably , of men like Buchanan and Harding and Coolidge . They do not tackle the problems they ought to tackle ; they accept measures they think mistaken both in principle and in detail because they are afraid to have trouble with Congress . The system not only  | results in a prenatal control of legislation upon subjects either difficult or unpopular . It offers an opportunity to powerful lobbies to multiply the area in which prenatal control operates with a weak president by playing on his fears . No one can read the history of the attempts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case . No one , either , can read the painful effort of Edward Moseley to secure essential legislation for railroad safety " without seeing how a lobby as powerful as that of the railroads can persuade both president and Congress to neglect an obvious duty . Even a strong president , like Franklin Roosevelt , is driven to postpone issues which he believes to be urgent by the fact that one or other of the lobbies at Washington may dissipate party coherency through the local influences it can bring to bear . With a weak president , this leads to the making of concessions which he knows to be indefensible . And even if the pressure of public opinion , as with the trusts , compels Congress , under presidential impulse , to action , the positive execution of the measure concerned will halt . That has certainly been the case with the Sherman Act . Even a president as positive as Theodore Roosevelt engaged largely in shadow-boxing with the great corporations for fear of the influence they might bring to bear at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sectionalism . It is difficult , anyhow , to draw any clear line beSec the history of his achievement admirably related in James Morgan 's biography footnote of him .  | tween the major American parties ; and the degree to which they hold the field is shown by the fact that , with but five exceptions since 186o , the Republican and Democratic parties have polled , between them , over 90 per cent of the votes in presidential elections . It is , however , true to say that with the possible exception of some of the major measures since 1933 , there is no measure that has been put upon the statutebook by one party which could not have been put there by another . The parties gain their majorities by the appeal they make to sectional interests ; ' and individual members take leave to think in sectional rather than in party terms . There is , in fact , more in common between a Democrat like Senator Wheeler of Montana and a Republican like the late Senator Borah of Idaho , than there is between Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wheeler , or between Senator 1 lastings of Delaware , a conservative Republican , and a Senator Borah . The votes of each are determined by considerations which transcend party lines in a way hardly understood in Great Britain ; and the presidential problem of securing coherency is greatly aggravated as a consequence . In legislation regulating hours and wages in commodities of interstate commerce , for instance , a Democratic senator or congressman from Massachusetts is bound to think less of the party line than of the effect on his constituency of so voting as to offer the prospect of being criticized in Massachusetts because he has sacri- footnote ' See this well worked out by Professor A. N. Holcomb in E. B. Logan , The American Political Scene ( 1938 ) , pp. 1-52 , x89-304.  | ficed its industrial interests to the lower standard of life which prevails in the South . A progressive-minded Southerner like Mr. Maury Maverick of Texas is pretty certain to pay by defeat for insisting that southern industry ought not , in matters of industrial legislation , to be parasitic upon its low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large part of the field of social and economic action . All this is to say that it tempts the Congress to avoid unity of outlook except under ininiense pressure from the White House . It follows the presidential lead instinctively only when it would be fatal for it not to follow that lead . Fatality depends on three things . There may be external war , as in 1 898 and 1917 ; there may be grave internal emergency , as in 1933 ; or there may be a public opinion so widespread in favor of the presidential policy that the Congress finds it unwise to follow its own bent . But the result is the clear one ? the mechanism of which I shall discuss later ? that the means a president must use to secure the unity he requires are all quite different from anything the founders could have imagined . They built a weak executive , they divided the sources of legislative power , because at the time they did their work the mental climate of the time called for that attitude . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to some such period as the Civil War . Since then , and in increasing degree , it has been a hindrance , and not a help , to the proper performance of the president 's duties . And this conclusion is not vitiated by the fact that some presidents ? Mr.  | Coolidge , for example ? had rarely any idea in the situation they confronted of what those duties were . The situation is difficult enough when the president 's party is in a majority in both houses . Then , at least , the party interest in re-election enables him to use the pressures at his disposal to maintain some measure of effective power . But if he loses that majority , as was evident in the administration of Hayes and in the last years of Wilson 's presidency , he is in a hopeless position . In those circumstances the Congress naturally feels that it has nothing to gain by co-operating with him ; and its term is passed in a mutual evasion of responsibility which has rarely any point save playing for advantage at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even with a presidential majority , to which the president himself has the strongest possible objection ; and , if his veto is inoperative , he is compelled ? the supreme folly in administration ? to execute policies of which he disapproves . A good example of this habit was the decision of Congress in 1939 to discontinue the cultural experiments made under the Works Progress Administration . All observers of them who had any serious acquaintance with their achievement were aware that they represented an epoch in the history of the relation between government and the arts . They were sacrificed because the opposition to the president had determined to make " economy " an issue of the campaign of 1940 ; and , though the sum involved was small , his nominal supporters took the view that the enemy could not be allowed to put ? what they would  | in any case put ? the need for economy before the electorate as an issue . The cultural experiment was therefore abandoned , despite the pressure of the president . But he was still left with the important administrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who would be rendered unemployed by reason of their abandonment . This leads to one conclusion which is of great importance to the proper understanding of the relation between Congress and the president . Its own instinctive and inherent tendency is , under all circumstances , to be anti-presidential . It may respect him ; it may even fear him ; it may give him a general if spasmodic support . But it is always looking for occasions to differ from him , and it never feels so really comfortable as when it has found such an occasion for difference . In doing so , it has the sense that it is affirming its own essence . It is more truly itself because it is exalting its own prestige . Some members , no doubt , act in this way because to fight the president is the highroad to notoriety . Others , the late Senator Borah , for example , are constitutionally uncomfortable if they support any president while he is in office . In the Senate , especially , a good deal of truth lies in the remark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be president , and that , in any case , they know more than he does . In the Senate , again , something is due to the fact that the chairman of an important committee is likely to have been there for many years . He has be-  | come a specialist in his allotted field . He has seen presidents and cabinet officers come and go ; it is only human , perhaps , for him to think , first , that his own view of what should be done is better than their view , and , second , that to enhance his own prestige it is important for him to change any presidential measure sufficiently to leave his own mark upon it . Mark Hanna and Roscoe Conkling are perhaps extreme instances of men who sought to move their colleagues to take the view , in the one case privately , in the other by public dispute , that the credit of their institution depended upon keeping the president in its leading strings . The history of Congress , and especially of the Senate , might well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the president its creature ; of the Senate , in particular , because its relation to the appointing power and to foreign relations , in addition to the fact that the career of the average senator will normally out last that of several presidents , give it a special advantage in seeking to enforce its view . No one can read such documents as the diaries of John Quincy Adams , of Polk , of Gideon Mlles , or the autobiographies of senators like Blaine and Hoar of Massachusetts without seeing that this is the case . The administration of President Grant was , no doubt , a particularly flagrant example of a Congress without any real sense of obligation ; but it is notable that even from a senator with cabinet experience it evoked no blame . " The executive department of a republic like ours , " wrote John Sherman , " should be subordinate to the  | legislative department .

It assumed the right to supervise in itemized detail the conduct of every executive agency it had brought into being . It believed that it was its duty to investigate each executive action , and , as in the classic case of Cleveland 's nomination of Burnett to the office of district attorney in Alabama , to see all confidential papers in connection with the administrative process .

" 11 From Grant to the election of McKinley the center of effective power was in Congress , and save for an occasional revolt most of the presidents seemed , at least publicly , content that it should be so . The picture of what , in an eminent Republican 's eyes , they ought to seek to be , was drawn for Benjamin I Iarrison by John Sherman . " The president , " he wrote , ' " should have no policy distinct from that of his party , and this is better represented in Congress than in the executive . " Hayes and Cleveland may have had their moments of challenge , but even the fact that they were supported in them by public opinion did not lead them to attempt any continuity of leadership . It was not until McKinley arrived at the White House that the balance began to swing in the presidential direction .

It was not merely that he was the first president since Washington personally to place his program before Congress . Even before he took office he had revolted against the notion that he was the instrument of congressional purposes .

" The theory of Woodrow Wilson corresponded closely to his practice . In the first two years of his administration , Congress was driven to pass an important series of domestic measures of which he was himself the chief architect . With the coming of war , he assumed the headship of the nation to a degree , and with powers , beyond any that Lincoln received . It is significant that he refused to accept a cabinet of national concentration , and that he stopped the movement which sought to repeat the Lincolnian precedent by associating with him a committee of both houses of Congress to assist him in the conduct of the war . Until the eve of the armistice , he was the unquestioned master of the nation . " Senators of sovereign states and leaders of parties , " writes one comnmentator , ' " grovelled in their marble corridors , so terrified were they of public opinion . " But Wilson pushed public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea of the almost personal sovereignty he had exercised aroused discontent everywhere ; and his opponents won a majority in the Congress of 1918 . Thenceforward , he was impotent ; and until 1932 the pendulum swung back to a stage where the effective leadership was in Congress and not in the president . In part , at least , this was due to the presidents themselves . Both Harding and Coolidge footnote 21G . R. Brown , The Leadership of Congress ( 1922 ) , p. 187.  | were mediocrities . The first had pledged himself , before election , to a " revival of party government as distinguished from personal government , " by which he meant that he would follow Congress and not lead it ; and , indeed , his nomination was mainly due to the realization of the chiefs of the Republican party that he was the type of man who would accept guidance . The treatment of his first budget in Congress , of which he expressed the hope that Congress would make no substantial changes , is typical of the treatment he received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bureau of the Budget so minutely that the printed testimony of their examination occupies over twenty thousand pages of print ; and they reduced them by over three hundred million dollars.22 Mr. Coolidge was hardly in better case . There were , in fact , few subjects upon which he had any ideas , and his general approach to politics was built upon the assumption that there was , in any circumstances , too much legislation . He did not , therefore , try to give any lead . " I have never felt , " he wrote , 23 " that it was my duty to attempt to coerce senators or representatives , or to take reprisals . The people sent them to Washington . I felt I had discharged my duty when I had done the best I could with them . In this way I avoided almost entirely a personal opposition , which I think was of more value to the country than to attempt to prevail through arousing personal fear . " The period , in fact , from footnote " Congressional Record ( 67th Congress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1929 ) , p. 232.  | 192 I to 1929 was the era of conscious abdication from power on the part of the president . Neither really appealed to the country for support against Congress , because neither had any policy for which to appeal . Each was content to give his party a free run of power ; and each assumed that the idea of the free run for the party meant the almost unfettered dominance of Congress . Congress , of course , was content to accept this view . The problem of the Hoover administration was a different one . Harding and Coolidge were mediocre hack politicians whose main recommendation to their colleagues was their very mediocrity . Mr. Hoover , with little political experience , came to office as an expert administrator , more or less in specific contrast to his predecessors . He encountered an emergency hardly less great than the war itself ; yet he seemed entirely unable to assume the leadership of Congress in that emergency . What is the reason ? Partly , no doubt , it derives from his acceptance of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakening of the legislative arni , " he wrote in 1934 , 44 " leads to encroachment by the executive upon the legislative and judicial functions , and inevitably that encroachment is upon individual liberty . If we examine the fate of wrecked republics over the world we shall find first a weakening of the legislative arm . " Something of this affirmation is , of course , a direct criticism of the policy pursued by his successor , Franklin D. Roosevelt . But it is also explicit in his actual relations footnote 24The Challenge to Liberty ( 1934 ) , pp. 125-126.  | with Congress . Tariffs and farm relief , he said shortly after taking office , are matters for Congress to determine ; his duty was merely to draw attention to them.2i Though he cordially disapproved of the Hawley-Smoot tariff , he refused to use his influence against it , on the ground that he could not know enough of its details to recommend specific alterations of them . He was deeply unpopular in Washint ton ; and this seems to have bred a self-distrust iii him which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps , also , the depth of his attachment to a laissez faire philosophy inhibited him from recommending that positive action which would have meant government interference with matters he conceived as the concern of business men only . While he was in office , at any rate , it was in Congress and not in him that the direction of affairs was centralized . It is not , I think , unfair to suggest that it was the public consciousness of the fact that he did not lead in the face of the great depression which was largely responsible for his defeat in the election of 1932 . Though the last six years are still living events , it happens that , in the context of this discussion , we are better informed about them than about any of the three previous administrations . The publication by President Roosevelt of his papers27 makes available not only- his public addresses , but also his private conferences with the press , and his annotations upon the footnote Cf. the criticism in the New Republic , Vol. 58 , p. 184. 20 New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Addresses of Franklin D.

It is hardly too much to say that these give us an insight into the working of the presidency such as we have not had since the diaries of John Quincy Adams and of Polk . From our angle , what they represent is a revival and extension of the theory of the presidency of which Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson were the exponents . The drive to action comes from the White House . Franklin Roosevelt 's conception of his office is intensely positive . Whether in foreign policy or in domestic affairs , the material Congress is made to consider is material for which he demands consideration . I shall discuss later the methods by which he has enforced consideration . Here it is sufficient to say that he has throughout chosen to lead , and has compelled Congress to follow . But what is significant in the experience of Franklin Roosevelt is not merely the extent and the intensity of the lead he has given ; what is significant also is the growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

" It may be doubted whether , even during the World War , there had been so complete an acceptance of presidential leadership as in those hundred days . In the president 's first term , it is broadly rue to say that the fulness of his direction was maintained . There was a good deal of confusion ; there was muttering against his program ; in one or two cases , there was even the threat of open revolt . But they came to nothing . " The victory of the president , " wrote the most eminent of living American historians , 30 " was complete all along the line . . . . After the democratic processes of debate and confusion were given free rein , leadership emerged in the end . When results were surveyed at the end of the discussion and uproar , it could truly be said that seldom , if ever , in the long history of Congress had so many striking and vital measures been spread upon law books in a single session . " The public seemed to confirm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power in the election of 1936 . But a change developed rapidly in the second term . footnote " 0 Cf. E. P. Herring , American Political Science Review , Vol. 28 , p. 70. 30 Professor C. A. Beard in Current History , October , 1935 , p. 64.  | He was defeated over the Court plan . His first effort at administrative reorganization suffered a similar fate . In measures relating to relief and agriculture he was compelled to accept drastic changes . In the realm of foreign policy , at a vital juncture in international affairs , he was unable to secure acceptance of the proposals he made for changes in neutrality legislation which would have enlarged his discretionary powers . The Republicans gained heavily in the mid-term elections of 1938 , and it was clear that the divisions in the ranks of the Democratic party jeopardized the president 's control of it . Mr. Roosevelt could , indeed , at the adjournment of 1939 , well have repeated Polk 's complaint of ninety years before.31 He had a nominal majority in both houses , but that majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in the consideration of presidential policies . Complaints of presidential autocracy were loud even among members of the Democratic party ; and the latter were prepared to enforce against the president the implications of senatorial courtesy over a judicial appointment even in a case where it was admitted that the proposed nominee was in every way appropriate for the position . It had become clear , in short , that with the disappearance of the more immediate gravities of the depression Congress generally , and the Senate in particular , was resentful of presidential leadership and eager to reduce it so far as they judged public opinion would permit . Mr. Roosevelt was not so disastrously placed as Mr. Wilson was in 1918 ; and footnote 81 Op. cit. , p. 186.  | the brilliance of his maneuvers , combined with the depth of his personal hold on the electorate , combined to prevent Congress from going too far in its resentment . But there was nothing like the magical atmosphere of the first two years of his presidency . The desire of Congress to recover its authority was unmistakable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary issue of the political scene . In the absence of special circumstances , this is to say , the hostility of Congress to the president is a part of its inner essence . Before we discuss its meaning , however , it is important to discuss the methods at the disposal of the president for influencing Congress . How does he get his way ? What are the methods at his disposal for securing unity of outlook between the executive and the legislature ? One answer is to say at once that there is no general rule . Every president has his opportunities of influence ; the way he uses them depends partly on his own personality and partly on the situation that he confronts . A president in an emergency is , obviously , likely to be far more influential than a president who , like Coolidge , is held to be ruling in a period of profound prosperity . A president whose party is in the majority in Congress has opportunities far greater than one who is in a minority in the House or the Senate or both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is obviously more likely to be suc-  | cessful in his handling of Congress than one who , like Mr. Hoover , is largely unaccustomed to its peculiar mental climate , and , in any case , unskilled in dealing with men . A president like John Quincy Adams , who is by nature aloof from public contact , is less likely to be successful than one who , like Theodore Roosevelt , has a genuine and instinctive liking for people . There is no general rule which enables one to predict with confidence that the relation between Congress and the president will be harmonious . Rather is it natural , on the record , to say that even if the normal conditions of harmony are present , at some stage strain is pretty certain to occur . The first great element which makes for unity is the fact that the president and his party have a common interest in remaining in power . However great their differences , neither can do without the other . It is rarely enough for a man to be president ; the drive that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful president ; and this , in its turn , makes him seek to find the best terms of accommodation he can with his parry . Usually , too , he wants renomination at the end of his first term ; and this is always a strong ground for persuasion toward common ends . The party , too , needs the president . It lives by his record . To break with him in any thoroughgoing way is to risk the support of public opinion at the next election . Psychologically , the persistence of acute strain between the president and his party is always a major advantage to their opponents ; it leads to defections from the ranks , and these , in doubtful areas ,  | may be pivotal to the result . Senator Norris ' loss to the Republican party in 1932 , for example , undoubtedly brought many wavering voters to Mr. Roosevelt 's side . And unity between them is important , too , in a material sense . A party lives by the spoils it has to distribute . The successful use of these is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of harmony reigns between executive and legislature , there is always the danger that the advantages of office may be dissipated by their maldistribution . It is important to realize that , the case of Andrew Johnson apart , no president has so far been completely deserted by his party . There have been grim periods of strain , as notably during the presidency of Tyler ; but , in the end , some sort of outer harmony has been arranged . Deep , also , as the quarrel may be , it is rarely so deep , perhaps curiously , as between one party and another . I say curiously , because the line of cleavage between the parties is always more apparent than real ; there is far more agreement between a progressive Republican like Senator La Follette and President Franklin Roosevelt than , say , between the former and Senator Hastings of Delaware . But it would take something like a constitutional revolution for Senator La Follette to emerge as a Democratic candidate for the presidency . Few Democrats were so critical of the Republican presidents of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he never " bolted " the party , and each presidential election found him offering at least a pinch of incense on the Republican altar .  | A certain degree of harmony usually prevails in the first months of a presidential term . The incumbent is new to office ; he has to feel his way ; there is a general understanding , both in Congress and in public opinion , that he shall not be attacked until he is accustomed to his routine . This is not , indeed , always the case . Harding 's death had hardly elevated Calvin Coolidge to the White House before the Senate rejected his nominee for the post of attorney-general , an event unprecedented in fifty years . In the first year of his administration they passed the soldiers ' bonus over his veto . They refused to accept his view of Japanese immigration policy . They rejected his proposal of adherence to the World Court , and they mangled , despite a threatened veto , his super-tax proposals so that the body became a corpse . But this is comparatively rare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the condition is important ? can usually count on a " honeymoon period " in which what he asks for will , in large measure , have assurance of being granted . It is usually toward the close of his first congressional session that the buttons are taken off the foils . The patronage , moreover , is an immense and necessary clement in the making of this unity . Senators and congressmen want posts for their followers ; and they know how much of their own future depends upon their ability to get them . To quarrel with the president may mean the withholding of the post from a man whose re-election begins to loom ; it may even mean that a party rival in his own state or district be-  | comes influential , with the possible result of his loss of the nomination at the next primary . It is the disposal of the patronage that keeps the party machinery oiled ; and the loss of influence through opposition to the president may be a serious matter . President Cleveland used this weapon to force through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the support of Senator Tillman for his most distinguished nomination to the Supreme Court by a similar method . Democrats who had waited for twelve long and hungry years for the patronage were easily stimulated , in the presence of crisis , to avoid discussion by an apt reminder from the president that the distribution would be delayed until the necessary measures were on the statute-book.3 ' How vital an element in the retention of power the patronage may be is shown by the famous controversy between Garfield and Roscoe Conkling . Even a cabinet minister , as Polk has made plain , 33 may have " sleepless nights " because " the impression was becoming general . . . . that the patronage of the government here was being wielded against him . " The immense extension of government service under President Franklin Roosevelt has not only been a direct cause of his great hold on Congress ; its growth , also , has been a cause of Republican bitterness . It is natural to expect presidential influence to decline when the jobs have been distributed . But the Roosevelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large patronage almost footnote 82Earle Looker , The American Way ( 1933 ) , p. 67. 88 Op. cit. , p. 40.  | continuously through the administration of two terms . In these circumstances , exploitation of the differences between the president and his supporters in Congress has been a far more difficult matter than it usually is . The president has also the veto power , in its various forms , as a method of influence . No one now accepts the view of Washington that a bill should be vetoed only upon the ground of its probable unconstitutionality . " If anything has been established by actual practice , " wrote President Taft , " it is that the president , in signing a bill , or returning it unsigned , must consider the expediency and wisdom of the bill , as one engaged in legislation and responsible for it . The Constitution used the word approve , ' and it would be a narrow interpretation to contract this into a mere decision as to legal validity . " 34 This is the generally accepted view ; even Benjamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any president , vetoed seventeen measures . The president , he wrote , 3J " does not deal with bills submitted for his approval upon the principle that he should approve only such as he would have voted for if he had been a member of Congress . Much deference is due to the Congress , and vetoes have customarily been used only when the fault in the legislation was serious in itself or as a precedent . " On the whole , it can not be said that the power is a great one , or that it has been widely used ; and Congress can always overrule the 34 The Presidency ( 1916 ) , pp. 13-14 . S5 This Country of Ours ( 1901 ) , p. 133 . On the general subject the best treatment is still E. C. Mason , The Veto Power ( 189o ) .  | president by a two-thirds majority of the members who constitute a quorum in either house 3 " Eight presidents ( seven of them in office before the Civil War ) did not exercise their veto power at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Madison on six occasions , and Monroe once . Jackson vetoed twelve measures and Tyler nine . In the post-Civil War period , Grant vetoed forty-three bills , Roosevelt forty , and Woodrow Wilson twenty-six . Cleveland vetoed no less than 358 measures ; but the vast majority of them were private pension bills of an indefensible character . The passage of a bill over the president 's veto is infrequent . No such passage occurred in the first fifty years of the republic . When it has been so passed , as with the Immigration Act of 1917 ( which , in substantially the same form , had been vetoed successively by Cleveland , Taft , and Wilson ) , or the soldiers ' bonus acts , passed over the vetoes of Coolidge , Hoover , and Franklin Roosevelt , the reason usually lies in the pressure of an organized opinion outside so strong that the Congress is not willing to take the risk of leaving the presidential veto as final . The great defect in the veto power is the fact that it is total and not partial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole ; he can not , like the governors of several states , veto particular items and approve the rest . It is upon this fact that Congress has erected the gigantic structure of the " pork barrel " in general appropriation bills , and the device of footnote 34 Missouri Pac . Ry . Co. v. Kansas 248 U. S. 276 ( 1919 ) .  | the " rider " as an attachment thereto . Few presidents will have the courage to veto this type of legislation , objectionable though it be , simply because the failure to secure necessary financial legislation hampers so greatly the process of administration ; though both Taft and Wilson were brave enough to do so . " President Grant vainly requested Congress to pass an amendment giving him authority to veto parts of bills . No doubt the new Budget Act of 1921 has effected some improvement in the financial powers of Congress . But it is still true to say in this regard that few financial measures go to the president for signature without items in them representing a gift to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the most lax president must be desirous of expunging if he could . The veto power , in short , though real , reaches but a little way . It will rarely be exercised in that financial realm where it is most needed ; and , outside that realm , it mostly marks either constitutional doubts on the part of the president 's advisers , or a difference between him and Congress so acute that its exercise rather marks the degree of strain than enables hun to overcome it . The real source , the patronage apart , of presidential power lies , ultimately , in the appeal to public opinion . This power has a twofold source . On the one hand , it derives from the fact of the president 's position ; being the one element in the government footnote " In Wilson 's case the rider , abolishing daylight saving , was passed as a separate bill over his veto . The matter is now dealt with separately by each state .  | which derives from the nation as a whole , it is natural for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him for leadership . On the other , the public is naturally interested in the process of government ; and a president of dominant personality can utilize that interest to his advantage . Each of these sources deserves some detailed exploration . The position of the president in the national life is hardly to be understood by anyone who has not seen it both continuously and at first hand . For the nation , while he is in office , he is in a real sense its embodiment . It has made him president ; that act of creation gives him for it a reality and a respect quite different in character from any that a hereditary monarch possesses . Members of the nation may hate and fear him ; Franklin Roosevelt is , in some ways , the most hated and feared president since Andrew Johnson . They may even despise him , as Calvin Coolidge was frankly despised by a considerable number of those who had any intimate contact with him . But , fear or hate , or even contempt , there is inherent in his office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a part of the make-up of the American citizen . He can no more escape it than the Englishman can escape the sense that royalty is somehow different from ordinary clay . And because every American has that sense , he looks up to the president , listens to him , watches with attention his every action . The president , by historic tradition , is placed on an eminence which not even so distinguished a figure as the chief justice of the United States can rival . The  | citizen may gossip about , and , as the various " whispering " campaigns have made clear , even against , the president . There may grow up , as in the case of President Coolidge , a whole saga of anecdotes about his habits . But the degree to which the president maintains interest , while he is president , even in the citizen most indifferent to politics , is an astonishing thing to the outsider . The result is that he looks to the president for views . He expects leadership from him . He assumes that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Boy Scout movement in the national life to the problems of soil erosion . He expects consideration for those opinions . He expects his congressman or his senator to have opinions about those opinions . And because the president is not only the ceremonial head of the nation but also its executive head , he follows with some closeness what happens to presidential opinions upon matters of significant public import . Evcry president has an incomparable audience waiting for the pronouncement he may choose to make ; to whomever else the Americans may not listen ? and they are , in any case , a nation of listeners ? they will listen to him . In any crisis , in the discussion of any big problem , they expect him to speak ; in a very real sense , when he has spoken , they feel that the nation has spoken . To give a lead upon the issues of his time is not merely a constitutional function to be exercised in a formal way ; it is , it increasingly becomes , an essential part of the presidential office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greater the stature he assumes . He makes things intelligible , discussable almost , by speaking out . The people expect to be interested by their president ; that is one of the reasons why they have elected him . They want to see him in action , to hear him speak . The foreigner may hear amusement , even contempt , about members of Congress ; he will rarely hear anything but respect for the presidential office as such . This attitude provides a basis which makes an appeal from the president to public opinion a matter of enormous significance . The audience is there to be interested ; it is its president who speaks to it . No one else has the power that he has to mobilize public opinion ; no one else can reach it so profoundly ; no one else 's judgment is , so decisively , " front page " news . The president , therefore , when he is at variance with Congress , starts with the advantage that there is a wide public opinion on his side . He is pretty sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of view ; he is certain to command an interest with which no one else can compare . And a skilful president can , of course , maximize the opportunities at his disposal . His messages and speeches can prepare the ground . His press conferences are nothing so much as propaganda by which , through information and suggestion , he secures receptivity for his attitude . Phrases of his will become the current coin of conversation ; Franklin Roosevelt 's " horse and buggy " utterance has passed into the tradition of the nation . The effective use of the radio ? which gives him almost the whole nation as an audience ? offers him  | the certainty that his case will be heard and known as he wishes it heard and known . He has a means at his disposal for creating confidence in his point of view which far surpasses that at the disposal of any rival factor in the nation . He will be heard even if , as in the election of 1936 , the overwhelming bulk of the press is opposed to him . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can , in Professor Cushman 's phrase , 38 " usually find it possible to create a public sentiment . .. . which party leaders in and out of Congress dare not ignore .

He must have arguments on its behalf that are simple and direct and intelligible . He must avoid springing novelties upon the public which touch traditions which the record has ? like that of the Supreme Court ? made sacred . I lc must try to appear as the reasonable man battling against wilful obstinacy or vested interests . Ile must have , like Theodore Roosevelt , the power of accurate timing in his appeals , or , like Franklin Roosevelt , something akin to genius for making the complex appear simple and obvious . Even a dull president , like Rutherford Hayes , can arouse the nation if the fighting ground against him is badly chosen by Congress.33 A president with a dominating temper can always be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government ( 1931 ) , p. 303. 39 Cf.

Granted , indeed , that the president really believes in his cause , and has persistency , he can so educate the nation in his support that a difficult case will make its way to victory . There are many instances to prove this . The fight of Theodore Roosevelt for conservation is one example of it . The ability with which Woodrow Wilson took a united nation with him into the War of 1914 is another ; for brilliance of timing , indeed , it would be difficult to surpass that achievement when it is remembered that , only five months before , the slogan " he kept us out of war " was one main cause of Wilson 's re-election . Even Franklin Roosevelt 's unsuccessful campaign against the Supreme Court prepared public opinion to believe that it was a reactionary body the composition of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtually unanimous acceptance by the Senate of nominations which , but a short time before , would undoubtedly have been stoutly challenged . So , too , skilful use by the president of the congressional power of investigation may prepare the way , through the revelations it effects , for the acceptance of legislation which Congress itself is dubious about , and against which all the pressure of powerful " lobbies " is being exerted at the Capitol . The ruthless but salutary investigation of Wall Street at the hands of Judge Pecora undoubtedly made possible the drastic regulation of the New  | York Stock Exchange . " It prepared the public mind for the notion that a cleansing was necessary by turning , under presidential inspiration , the pitiless light of publicity upon the habits of men who had previously seemed beyond the reach of public criticism . The pathetic appearance , under examination , of men like Andrew Mellon , " the greatest secretary of the treasury since Hamilton , " broke the worship of idols whom it was necessary to break if the presidential policies were to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power is , there are limits to it . A president who offends certain deep traditions in the American mental climate will find that a recalcitrant Congress , if it is stubborn enough , can resist the pressures he can mobilize . A demand for innovation will , normally , force its way to acceptance in a crisis . But if habituation to the crisis develops , persistency in innovation may then break on the rock of older habituations the cultural lag of which has been staved , rather than broken , by the crisis . This , l suspect , has been in part the explanation of the adverse fortune of Franklin Roosevelt with Congress since 1936 . With the passage of the supreme emergency on the crest of whose wave he rode , certain normal American ideas , the divine right of the business man to be free from government interference , the idea of a balanced budget , the belief ( now wholly untrue ) that any energetic American can find a job if he really tries , that that government is best which spends least , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wall Street Under Oath ( 1939 )  | balanced annually ( an interesting fiscal superstition ) , have all resumed something of their wonted authority . The breakdown of business control gave the trade unions an immense opportunity , behind which the president put considerable pressure ; and the National Labor Relations Act was the result . But American conditions have not , historically , been favorable soil for a strong trade union movement , and the reaction against its gains has , despite the president , made considerable headway in Congress . The president , in a word , can compel attention for the things he desires ; but his chance of victory for those things is not one of which he can be certain . Almost always , his success depends upon the presence of a mental climate it is beyond his power to control . His authority , moreover , is limited for another reason . Not only Congress grows anxious under a president who too frequently cracks the whip . Beyond it , there is always a powerful current of opinion adverse to a strong president as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government may be excessively dominated by the executive ; that is un-American . It is pretty clear that some of the judges , of unquestionably liberal outlook , who shared in finding the National Industrial Recovery Act unconstitutional , were moved by fears that it conferred dangerously excessive powers of delegated legislation upon the president.41 And there is a widespread fear , especially prevalent among farmers and business men of " too much government " ; the tradition of laissez faire footnote 41 Schechter v. U. S. , 295 U. S. 495  | has still deep roots in the American consciousness . The period in which the realm of federal intervention was both narrow and expected to be narrow , is still near enough for such intervention to encounter the cross-current of suspicion that it is eroding that individual responsibility the anxiety for which is a legacy inherent in a civilization still hardly a generation distant from the traditions of the frontier . The president , moreover , must pick his issues carefully . They must be wide enough to be genuinely interesting . They must be of the type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem important . They must , if possible , transcend the inherent sectionalism of Congress . And the appeal to the public must not be made too frequently . Just as an excessive use of the radio would dull its influence by making it overfamiliar , so the president must not appear as a man who simply can not " get on " with Congress . His case must be of the kind upon which the electorate is likely to feel strongly ? strongly enough , at least , for them to feel that they must express themselves about it either in letters to the press or by personal communication with their senator or congressman . It must , too , be the kind of issue that is familiar enough in its general outline to have a historic basis upon which presidential sentiment can be built up . When Franklin Roosevelt pressed for the Securities and Exchange Act , he had behind him the memories , far from dim , of Theodore Roosevelt 's thunder against " malefactors of great wealth , " and Woodrow Wilson 's " new freedom " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Nazi rape of Czecho-Slovakia , he could rely , not only upon the still vivid memories of the war years , but upon the deep emotions of a large number of Czech-Americans to whom the rebirth of their native land in 1918 had been one of the two or three supreme public events in their lives . The success of the president , I have said , often depends upon factors outside his control . The immense complications of the neutrality tangle of 1938-39 are interesting evidence of this . The president is searching for a free hand . He confronts in Congress an opposition , largely reflected in the country at large. , which is compounded of a variety of factors . Some of it is the traditional demand for American isolation ; Washington 's warning against " permanent alliances " is still one of which every president must take account . Some of it is due to the revelations of congressional inquiries , of which that of Senator Nye into the armaments industry is perhaps outstanding , that have made many Americans ? not least those of liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in practice , conceal . Some of it , no doubt , is due to a suspicion that there is not so much to choose between Herr Hitler and Mr. Chamberlain ; the profound psychological impact of Munich upon American opinion is unquestionable , especially upon that liberal opinion so important to Mr. Roosevelt . A good deal of it is sheer maneuvering for position in the next presidential election ; the more the president can be discredited by defeat the less will he be a vital factor when that issue is determined .  | Yet none of these factors is a tithe so important as what may happen in Europe itself . The issue of American neutrality will be largely determined by the limits of the aggression attempted by the Fascist powers . To what conclusions does this argument lead ? First , I think , it should be noted that a distinction must be drawn between the " crisis " situation and the " normal " situation . In the first , the president 's position is so overwhelming that it is , broadly , imperative for Congress to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation requires action , and it looks to the president to define the kind of action that is required . It assumes the necessity , in crisis , for the conference upon him of wide powers ; it is impatient of doubt about , or hostility to , their conference . It may , indeed , almost be said that it is too impatient ; no one can analyze , for instance , the workings of the Espionage Act of 1917 without seeing that Congress then practically abdicated before the president.42 Much the sank is true of the " hundred days " of Franklin Roosevelt . It would have been literally impossible , in the face of public opinion , for Congress to have resisted the pressure to give the president what he chose to demand ; there are , indeed , careful observers who believe that if , at that moment , he had demanded even so drastic a measure as the nationalization of the banks , Congress would have had to accept it . In a footnote 42 Cf. Walter Nelles , Espionage Act Cases ( 1920 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .  | crisis , to put it shortly , public opinion compels the abrogation of the separation of powers . There is really only one will in effective operation , and that is the will of the president . He is as powerful , while the emergency has a psychological hold on the country , as the British prime minister at a moment of national emergency . But in a " normal " situation the position is very different . The American system , in its ultimate foundations , is built upon a belief in vveal : government . It must never be forgotten that the ( ; otst itution is the child of the eighteenth century ; that the influence of Locke and Montesquieu is written deeply into its clauses . Those who made it were , out of actual and inferred experience , above all afraid of arbitrary power . They constructed a system of checks and balances as a bulwark against its emergence . They did so because they believed , with Madison , that " the accumulation of powers in a single hand is the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective citizen whom they were above all considering was the bourgeois man of adequate property who needed protection , on the one hand against an ambitious executive , and on the other against a legislature unduly under the influence of the propertyless mob . Naturally enough , in their day , the good state seemed to be the negative state . They were not unduly enamored of democracy , even if few of them would have said openly with Alexander Hamilton that the people was " a great beast . " They believed profoundly in fundamental law ; and their interpretation of its  | substance , whether they were Federalists like John Marshall or Democrats like Thomas Jefferson , was that it guaranteed their conception of the rights of property against legislative invasion . The state they constructed was the negative state that a nation of small property owners required ; the state , be it noted , that under similar pressures , if in different form , was being simultaneously created in England and in France . The nineteenth century seemed , in large degree , to vindicate their notions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the disposal of the nation saved it from the deep social tensions of Europe for nearly a hundred years after 1787 . It was not until such a period as the Haymarket Riots that an observer could claim general acceptance for the view that there was no qualitative difference between the problems of America and those of Europe . The remarkable insights of men like Orestes Brownson43 fell upon cars largely deaf . I Ic was speaking of class conflict when little else could be perceived but that contest over slavery which , by its intensity , seemed to transcend all other forms of social difference . The idea of weak government fitted into the pattern of the first century of American development . It was aided by the facts , first , that the major parties were dominated by business men whom that idea suited ; and second , that until the turn of the century trade unions were not a serious force to be reckoned with footnote 43 There is now a good biography of this remarkable man by Arthur Schlesinger Jr. , Orestes Brownson ( 1939 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Science and Society , Spring , 1939.  | in American politics . Legislative experiments in a positive direction were hampered at every turn by the courts filled predominantly by judges whose ideas of constitutional validity were shaped by devotion to the ideal of the negative state . Until almost the time of Woodrow Wilson , it is not unfair to describe the Senate as a rich man 's club ; and the attitude of Theodore Roosevelt to what now appear to be the very moderate ideas of the elder La Follette makes it obvious that the difficulties against which positive ideas in social legislation had to struggle were very great . ' The power , moreover , of the business forces over the parties was immense ; the history both of the Bryan campaign and of the Progressive movement is evidence of that . Even if the farmers were , on occasion , tempted " to raise less corn and more hell , " they were uninterested in problems ? the hours of labor , for example ? which went beyond their narrow horizon . The disposition of forces in American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a government which did not disturb those conditions of confidence which business men approved . It was to the maintenance of those conditions that Congress largely directed its attention . On examination , it will be found that practically every major occasion in which there has been conflict between Congress and the president was , from Jackson onward , an occasion when the policy of the president seemed likely to disturb them . With Jackson , it was the bank ; with Andrew Johnson , it was the fulfilment of the footnote " Cf. Pringle , op. cit. , pp. 547-548.  | triumph of the industrial North against the agrarian South ; with Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson , it was a struggle against monopolies , with Franklin Roosevelt , it has been an effort to subdue the operations of business enterprise to a larger social purpose . In each case , also , the structure of the American Constitution , by dividing initiative in policy , through the legacy of a belief that weak government is desirable , has confused that initiative . The result has mainly been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in emergency , have secured what they sought ; few Congresses have been able to prevent all they have desired to prevent from being enacted . No plan of action has been legislated coherently , or administered coherently . No allocation of direct responsibility for failure on either head has been seriously possible . For once the need for a positive state began to be admitted ? as it was reluctantly admitted in the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt ? one outstanding principle was clear . It was the principle , long ago adumbrated by John Stuart Mill , that the formulation of legislative proposals is not a task for which a legislature is fitted . A legislature can criticize ; it can ventilate grievance ; its power to investigate through committees is invaluable ; and , not least , as it fulfils these tasks it provides a process of public education which is pivotal to democratic government . But a legislature like Congress is at once too big and too incoherent of itself to devise an organic and unified approach to the problems of the time . It is not effectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members are not compelled to think by their position in terms of the problems of the whole nation . Each house of Congress has a separate prestige ; their common prestige is , by their nature , inherently anti-presidential in character . To be something , Congress is forced to take a stand against the president ; it can not be anything if it merely follows his lead . And the weakness of the system is magnified by the fact that t hough it can seek its own elevation only by discrediting him , it can not destroy him . He is there , whet her it Will or no , for his term ; and his power to appeal against its decisions is but interstitial in character . The result of the system , normally , is therefore to dissipate strength rather than to integrate it . The president is usually less than he might be , because the stature of Congress is diminished the more fully he has his way ; and Congress is never all that it might become , because it is so organized as to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , true that the ties of party provide a barrier against the consequences of this dissipation of strength . The president and his supporters have always a common interest in getting something done because their record measures the chance of later success at the polls . Yet that common interest is tempered by a number of hindrances . It is hindered by the fact that the committee system makes a number of little presidents , as it were , in the congressional sphere ; there is a dual quasi-executive within the legislature , even though it does not enjoy executive power .  | It is hindered again by the fact that , as the president 's term draws to its close , the temptation to withdraw from him what allegiance the party system enforces is maximized . If the president , like Hayes , is not seeking re-election at the end of his first term , his power is likely to be small . " The very fact , " writes Professor Commager , 45 " that Hayes was not a candidate for reelection accentuated the question of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most bitter political conflicts in our history ? intraparty conflicts into which Hayes himself was drawn . " And it is notable that the second term of those presidents who have been re-elected has in each case been less creative than the first . The problem of the succession means far more to congressional politics than the fruits of the legislative process . No president is in a position to prevent this disintegration in normal times ; even Washington could not do so , for it was in his second term that the forces were aligned which ultimately became the Federalist and Republican parties . An American party is not a unity in the English sense ; it is a loose confederation of interests each of which is playing for power . It is therefore engaged , not merely in a fight against the opposing party , but also in a fight against factions within itself . No president can be sure that he will not have to pay the price for that factionalism . " I learned tonight , " wrote Polk , on the twenty-first of footnote 4 ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Three Terms , " New York Times Magazine , July 23 , 5939.  | April , 1846,4 " that the Senate , by the votes of Mr. Calhoun and his wing of the Democratic party , united with the whole Whig party , had rejected the nomination of Dr. Amos Nourse as collector . . . . This is , in addition to other evidence , a pretty clear indication that Mr. Calhoun intends to oppose my administration . He has embarrassed the administration on the Oregon question . He is playing a game to make himself president . . . . " On June 24 , 1846 , he is complaining of further rejections through the influence of certain senators . " The sooner , " he conuuents , 47 " such party men go into the ranks of the Whig party , the better . " " Democratic and Whig senators , " he writes on February 28 , 1848,48 " . . . . act solely with the view to the elevation of themselves or their favorites to the presidential office . . . . Senators act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take care of . " Many later presidents must have re-echoed these sentiments . In " normal " times , indeed , the relation between the president and Congress has a curious analogy with that between the French governments of the Third Republic and the Chamber of Deputies . No doubt , there is far greater executive stability in the American system ; the Constitution provides for that . But there is in both an incoherence and irresponsibility in the relations between executive and legislature which it is impossible not to remark ; in both , also , factionalism tends footnote 46 Op. cit. , p. 72. 47 Op. cit. , p. 117. 46 Op . Cit. , p. 313.  | greatly to destroy the prospect that any government may hope continuously to drive through an ample program of social change . In both , also , embarkation upon that program results in a withdrawal of business confidence ; and a reforming government is presented with the alternatives of recovery or reform . In both , too , the individual legislator is prone to take every opportunity to mark his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too often , has to be purchased by administrative favors . Both show , especially in the last generation , the striking phenomenon of " normal " governments being succeeded , every so often , by " crisis " governments , in which legislative irresponsibility compels the conference of wide powers upon the executive as a remedy for the irresponsibility . In both , also , a return to " normality " produces a return to the earlier characteristics . Neither shows any propensity to embark upon those fundamental reforms which the incoherence and instability suggest as imperative . It may , of course , be said that the present system in the United States has served it well enough for a century and a half ; that each crisis has demonstrated on the part of Congress a willingness to confer sufficient powers upon the president to cope with it . The answer to this view is , I think , twofold . It is , in the first place , clear that the basis of an institutional system framed for a negative state can not easily be adequately adapted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the latter type of organization needs an integration and a coherent continuity that it can not attain under the American system ; more , it requires standards of  | administrative performance and experience which can not be improvised every four or eight years . And in the second place , no democracy in the modern world can afford a scheme of government the basis of which is the inherent right of the legislature to paralyze the executive power . Presidential programs often suffer from grave inadequacies ; presidential leadership is often smaller than the problems it confronts . However inadequate , and however small , they are the only programs and leadership which are projected upon a national plane ; more , they alone are so operated in the open as to focus upon themselves the whole force of public opinion . The weakness of the relationship established between the president and Congress is that it gives the latter a constant interest in the diminution of his power . It is not merely that , so to say , he is on the way out as he is on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possesses are not continuous enough in their operation to make his leadership continuously effective except under conditions the avoidance of which is the purpose of every scheme of government . Whatever the weaknesses of the British system , it makes responsibility for action clear and direct and intelligible . An executive which can not command the confidence of the legislature may appeal beyond it to the electorate . So long as it controls the legislature , its authority is coherent and integrated . These are immense advantages . The authority may be abused ; but at least the responsibility for the abuse is always clearly indicated . The energy of the executive is not continually dissipated in patching up the majorities it requires for  | some degree of the program it has urged . The allegiance of its supporters is not constantly shifting on its axis . There is not a continuous interest in the legislature to develop a policy of its own at the cost of executive credit . No doubt a good deal in the American pattern is easily explicable in historical terms . But that still leaves open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present inadequacy . The modern state requires disciplined leadership ; the American system leaves no assurance of its continuous availability . It is , indeed , built upon foundations that are inherently suspicious of leadership as such . From the foundation of the republic , as we can see from the pages of Maclay 's Diary , the president has run in the leading strings of congressional control . This control has not presented a clear alternative to his leadership . Rather , for the most part , its result has been a confusion of the public mind . Ile may move in one direction ; that is almost an invitation to Congress to move in several other directions . The clash of opinion about the wisdom of the alternative he emphasizes does not lead back to the people from whom his authority emanates . Rather does it result in an interregnum of power while the forces in opposition arc maneuvering for an advantage they can only seize at stated intervals without chronological coincidence with national necessity . These are momentous difficulties which reach down into the foundations of the Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by any of the minor ex-  | pedients of reform that have so far been proposed . The central problem of representative government in a democracy is , I repeat , to make the source of responsibility for action unmistakable , and to reach at once that citizen-body whose verdict upon its exercise is alone decisive . That problem , I suggest , is not solved in the American system . lts very nature is to dissipate responsibility by substituting the politics of maneuver for the politics of policy . No doubt , as Adam Smith said , there is a great deal of ruin in a nation ; and emergency will always force a unity upon forces which the system is constructed to divide . But a government does not prove its adequacy because it can transcend its own principles in an emergency ; its adequacy is born of its ability to prevent the outbreak of emergency . That is the test by which the relationship between the president and Congress must be judged . At the least , there are grounds for grave doubt whether it can meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfactorily solved the problem of its control of foreign relations , it can at least be said that nowhere has a more careful effort been made toward that end than in the United States . The president may have immense powers in negotiation ; but in the ultimate disposition of its result he is the subject of the Senate before whose power of veto and amendment he must bow . Where the I louse of Commons is , in this realm , the virtual creature of any government that is not the author of overt disaster , the Senate of the United States is in a position at least to scrutinize every step of the executive , and , in large degree , to control its outcome . It can not be said , I think , that a satisfactory balance between the president and the Senate has so far been attained ; indeed it is in a real sense difficult to state their relations in any precise way . For , in the first place , ever since the administration of Washington a controversy has been proceeding between them as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise ; and , in the second , the relation changes as the international situation contributes a different emphasis to  | American history . Different presidents , moreover , have viewed their foreign problems quite differently , and this , also , has changed the emphasis . But whatever the international situation , and whoever has occupied the presidential office , it can , I think , be truly said that no legislative assembly in the world rivals the Senate of the United States in its influence in the international sphere . The provisions of the Const it ut ion hive but a partial index to the nature of the relationship . The president , it lays down , " shall have power , by and with the consent of the Senate , to make treaties , provided twothirds of the senators present concur . " ' Negotiation is the prerogative of the president ; but the treaty is binding upon the citizens of the United States only with the consent of the Senate . There is a sense , also , in which the relation of the House of Representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be raised to complete its implementation without the consent of that house . The declaration of war , moreover , is a joint act of both houses . The Senate , further , is directly concerned in foreign relations since it must confirm the appointment of all ambassadors and other diplomatic representatives . This is the formal framework of the structure as the founders of the Constitution defined it . I need not say that it supplies but a partial clue to the grasp of the whole network of relations that have been built upon it . It may fairly be said that two substantial principles emerge upon which the whole presidential relation to footnote 1 Art . II , Sec. 2 , clause 2.  | foreign affairs has been built . The first can not be better stated than in the classic words of Thomas Jefferson : " The transaction of business with foreign nations is executive altogether . " This , as a general rule , has come to be the accepted practice of the United States . Apart from that process of approval and consent of which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is the president who decides what degree of consultation shall precede the formal submission of the result of his negotiations . From this wide freedom there follows , I think logically , the second principle that Congress , and above all the Senate , shall not be prejudiced constitutionally in the exercise of its powers in its own sphere , by what the president has done in his . No doubt , in fact , there is continuous reciprocity of influence . But that is not held to deter either authority from independent action in its allotted field . This allocation of functions has , in fact , come to mean that the president has a decisive hand in the shaping of foreign affairs , even though the Congress , and especially , of course , the Senate , retains a negative voice . Ile is considerably dependent upon the secretary of state , whose department has grown from the four clerks , a French interpreter , and two messengers under Jefferson to some six hundred officials in Washington and some three thousand employed all over the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a specially close relation to , even supremacy over , the foreign secretary , so it has been the case , in general , for the president of the United States to  | take the main hand in shaping at least the large outlines of foreign policy . Some presidents , indeed , like Jefferson , Polk , Theodore Roosevelt , and Woodrow Wilson , have been. , to all intents and purposes , their own secretaries of state ; others , like 1 larding and Coolidge , have left a large discretion to the State Department . Woodrow Wilson seems to have allowed Mr. Bryan some elbowroom in the field of the latter 's special hobby of arbitration , while retaining a general oversight of his work ; and I suspect that this would not be an unfair description of the relations between Mr. Hull and President Franklin Roosevelt . Great men , no doubt , whose collaboration it has not been easy to subjugate , have presided over the State 1 ) cpartment ; five of them subsequently became presidents , two chief justices , while three others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures in American history . Nevertheless , one can not read the essential documents without the clear inference that the overmastering impulses in foreign affairs derive from the presidential mind . An occasional president may be content to play a secondary role ; but I do not think this can be said of more than four presidents , and , with all but Grant , foreign affairs played a comparatively minor part in his administration . Whatever the degree of consultation with his colleagues , in the cabinet or in Congress , the president remains the chief architect in this field . This can be seen if we consider briefly the range of his initiative . It is for him to choose , and to dismiss , his chief collaborators ; the secretary of state who does  | not agree with him must go . The ambassador with whom he is not satisfied may , like Mr. Page , remain in office ; but it is a sufficient commentary upon his influence that , after Mr. Wilson 's death , a great mass of Page 's letters to him were discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of new governments . How powerful that influence has been in the recent history of Mexico it is unnecessary to emphasize . But it has had , also , an immense influence in the history of Europe ; Franklin Roosevelt 's recognition of the Soviet government , for example , may well prove to have been a real turning point in its history , as may his refusal so far ' to recognize the Japanese conquest of Manchuria or the German absorption of Czecho-Slovakia . He has a wide and undefined authority to send special agents abroad ; the part played by Colonel I-Iouse in the European War of 1914 ? 18 1s only the supreme example of policies shaped and understandings secured by this means . He has an undefined power , further , to enter into compacts that are less t han treaties without the participation of the Senate ; the consequence of this power may be only slightly less than actual entrance into a treaty . I-1e has the exclusive and unchallengeable right to negotiate treaties up to the point of their acceptance by the Senate ; though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of the Treaty of Versailles , makes the lesson clear that in treaty-making full consultation with at least the vital figures in the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs is pivotal to the suc- footnote 2 August , 1939.  | cessful conclusion of any treaty which arouses serious debate . He has a wide initiative in the official formulation of the national foreign policy ; and though , no doubt , this is in some degree a hazardous political adventure , there is no field in which the president has so full an opportunity of giving a lead . No Furopean , certainly , of my own generation is likely to forget how Woodrow Wilson , between 191 7 and 1919 , voiced in his public utterances the aspirations of the common people all over the world . The president , moreover , is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces of the United States . In that aspect , he may legitimately take action , as the history of INlexico bears ample witness , which leaves Congress no alternative but to follow the lead he has chosen to give . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It must be understood that in each of its aspects , especially in a critical time , the whole world is watching with attention the direction a president may follow . There is no doubt , for example , that British policy in the Far East at the present moment is largely conditioned by the president 's attitude to Japanese aggression in China . There is little doubt , either , that the Fascist powers had , for a long time , been largely deterred from risking a European war by fear that Mr. Roosevelt might persuade America to place at least its boundless material resources at the service of the democracies . The leadership provided by the president in foreign affairs is , without any doubt , the pivotal influence in framing foreign policy . Whatever part the Constitution may assign to the legislative  | agency , the spirit of the presidential purpose , especially in a situation of gravity , is the overwhelming factor in forming the direction and the decision . It is , of course , inevitable that it should be so . Whatever may have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy and its negotiation can not be carried on by a numerous assembly . The interviews , the documentation , the understandings of personal intercourse all forbid it . Some degree of secrecy is inescapable in matters of international intercourse ; anyone , for instance , can see that negotiations like those for an Anglo-Soviet pact could not be carried on to the accompaniment of full public discussion at each of its stages ; a proposal of marriage must be made in private , even if the engagement is later discussed in public . That the balance of diplomatic power should , therefore , be in the president 's hands , arises almost from the nature of things . Et is , of course , a limited power . The Senate has very fully maintained its right to confirm treaties , to reject them , or to amend them before offering its concurrence . The I louse of Representatives has always insisted upon its right to refuse appropriations which become necessary under ratified and confirmed treaties ; though I believe it has never exercised that right . The Congress has insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its power to abrogate treaties . Acts of Congress may also limit the presidential initiative ; in 1939 , for example , the area within which the president might maneuver was clearly limited by the implications of the Neutrality Act of 1937 . In an ex-  | treme instance the fact that a declaration of war must be made by both houses of Congress is a safeguard against a supreme presidential indiscretion . Seward , for instance , was in favor of declaring war against France and Spain to cement the union ; had he persuaded Lincoln to accept his view , the result might have been grave indeed . Against misjudgment of that kind , the congressional power is a check , even if its limits are obvious . Taken as a whole , the record of American presidents in the making of foreign policy is a remarkable one . There have been , no doubt , the heavy sins of " dollar diplomacy " ; this is not , however , a realm iii which a European can afford to cast the first stone . There has been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the Oregon boundary , with Cleveland over Venezuela , with the quite indefensible actions of Theodore Roosevelt in the diplomatic prelude to the building of the Panama Canal . If , indeed , there is a general case to be made against presidential leadership in foreign affairs , it is less upon the grounds of policy than upon the grounds of the defective organization he has built for informing himself about the affairs of foreign nations . In the post-Civil War period , American diplomatic representation in at least the major states has been the reward for standing in the party , often financial standing only , rather than for expertise in foreign affairs . A rich newspaper proprietor , the owner of a large department store , the husband of a great heiress to a fortune made in patent foods , have , to take stray examples , been accounted adequate  | holders of posts which , in most other countries , go only to men who have proved their fitness by long political or diplomatic experience . An embassy , perhaps , is less important in the days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monroe and Charles Francis Adams made the place of the United States so formidable in diplomatic discussion by their skill and force . This may explain the increasing tendency of the president to rely for the information he requires upon the special envoy , often appointed outside the categories which require senatorial confirmation , on the ground that he enjoys in a peculiar degree the private confidence of the president . But , for reasons I have already suggested , I think the development an unfortunate one . Its tendency is necessarily toward the choice of men whose contacts are not only interstitial , but who arc almost bound , like Colonel I louse , to be " yes-men " for the president in order to retain their influence with him . They tend , therefore , as the ( louse Papers make evident , to see mainly what the president wants them to see ; and they lack that independence and responsibility which are the hallmarks of the expert diplomatist . The record of the presidents , I have said , is on the whole remarkably good in foreign policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been the case . With the earlier presidents , it is easy to understand . From Washington to Monroe , every president , by the experience through which he had passed , had received a severe schooling in the technique of diplomatic intercourse . That was true , also , of John Quincy  | Adams , whose claim to the authorship of the Monroe Doctrine is no small one . From Jackson to the Civil War , the main pressure of foreign policy is concerned with affairs within the American hemisphere ? Mexico , the Oregon boundary , and so on ; in each of these , either the power of the United States as against any possible opponent was overwhelming , or , as with the Oregon boundary question , it was dealing with an antagonist who was always eager for an honorable compromise . The Civil k7ar , indeed , presented questions to the president of great delicacy and magnitude ; and there is no more remarkable proof of the inherent and inescapable greatness of I.incoln than in the study of his alterations of Seward 's dispatches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with any close grip on foreign affairs ; Grant 's handling of the Santo Domingo problem is merely one of many proofs of his unfitness for the presidential office . But from Cleveland onward , it is , I think , true to say that only Harding and Coolidge showed an ignorance of and unfitness for the control of foreign affairs ; though in each case those defects were merely particular instances of a general incapacity . Theodore Roosevelt may have had , to excess , the Palmerstonian truculence , and in a less degree this is true of Cleveland also . But both Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt showed , in this realm , a capacity to speak in world-terms which has already given them a special place in history ; while footnote 8 Mr. Justice Holmes , who as a young officer in the Civil War knew Lincoln personally , was fond of telling how he first realized the greatness of Lincoln by the study of these dispatches .  | the limited opportunities Mr. I-Ioover had showed him , in this aspect , as a man capable of wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the processes in which it is involved , a thing far more complex to make effectively than is the case in Europe . The grasp , therefore , which presidents have held upon it is all the more striking . The reasons , I suggest , are complicated . In the first place , it is so because the president is not , as Lord Bryce thought , likely to be merely an " available " man . The capacities which make him president are likely , therefore , to be displayed in foreign affairs as in other realms . The remoteness , further , of America from Europe and the Far East gives him in relation to their problems a sense of poise which is less easily attainable by the statesmen of other powers . And it is important that in the United States , differently from in Europe , foreign affairs arc party problems in a high degree . The president , therefore , who seeks success in this rcalni has to rely far more on public opinion than is the case elsewhere ; and to rely upon it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process by which Woodrow Wilson brought a united nation into the war of 1914-18 , or who has scrutinized narrowly the effort of Franklin Roosevelt to persuade the American people into the acceptance of his views , will realize how large a part the factor of public opinion plays . It does so for another reason . America is an amalgam of the most diverse national strains . Each of them has not only its special views on foreign policy ; more important , each of them is likely to have a spokesman in  | Congress whose views will count . And what is true of national strains is true also , if in a lesser degree , of religious faiths . American policy to tsarist Russia was profoundly influenced by anti-Jewish pogroms there ; Franklin Roosevelt , in his attitude to the Spanish Civil War of 1936-39 was deeply influenced , perhaps overinfluenced , by the knowledge of an immense Roman Catholic population in the United States ; Protestant missionary zeal has had a considerable effect on policy in Turkey and China . The delicacy involved in handling these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in diplomatic technique ; and to this must be added the fact that a wise president learns from his dealings with Congress many of the qualities which are important in international intercourse . Yet in the postwar years , I think the source of presidential authority has lain in two different directions . There can be little doubt , despite his defeat over the Peace of Versailles , that the emergence during the war of Woodrow Wilson as a world-figure equaled only by Lenin has given the American people an interest in foreign politics which provides the president with an audience for his ideas upon them greater than at any previous time . No one who saw the almost painful intensity with which every move of the Czech crisis in September , 1938 , was followed throughout the United States can doubt that this is the case . And because there is this interest , the notion of the president as the leader of the nation has come to have a special relevance in foreign affairs . He is expected to play a big part there . The citizen looks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sense , as never before , that America is a world-power , and that his president must play his part in a manner proportionate to the influence of the United States in world affairs . This attitude is new in its intensity ; but its beginnings can be traced back to the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt . In the aftermath of the SpanishAmerican War , men began to realize that the part America was to play was different from anything that they had previously expected . They felt that a new epoch had arrived in their destiny . They had colonies ; they were exporting capital ; they had begun to have , as in China , spheres of special influence . There grew up in America even before the war the consciousness of a world-destiny ; and this consciousness has been profoundly reflected in the attitude of the presidents . I do not think this conclusion is vitiated by the fact that every president , in his endeavor , if he will , to play this world-part , is confronted by a profound isolationism which affects considerable areas of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Far West are uninterested iii I " ; uropean affairs ; and we are bidden to remember that no president , as he frames a worldpolicy , can neglect the immense influence of , for example , German , Italian , and Irish settlers . I do not think he can neglect them ; there is a real truth and significance in Henry Adams ' picture of Senator Lodge scouring round Washington to do favors for Irish and Greek constituents . ' But I think that their influence can easily be exaggerated . In the first place , footnote 4 The Education of Henry Adams ( 1918 ) , p. 419.  | the experience of Woodrow Wilson suggests very clearly that great leadership in a president can always transcend the power of these elements in a great emergency . In the second place , the interest of the West in Far Eastern issues is profound ; and these become daily more related , and are understood to be related , to European problems . The United States , moreover , is now , for good or ill , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamental ; and this plays a part in pushint , any president toward a leadership likely , I think , to grow more , and not less , significant . Nor must one forger that every national group which pushes hint to isolationism is usually counterbalanced by another national group which is pushing him against it . In the result , I think he is bound to choose a position which gives his people as a whole the sense , not only that the United States has something important to say on world-problems , but that it has power enough behind what it says to compel the world to listen . The president , in fact , shapes and voices the foreign policy of the United States to a degree that no other competing power can rival . The treaty-making power apart ? I shall discuss this later ? he is , subject to the influence of public opinion , incomparably the master of the field . His speeches have an influence that is supreme . His ambassadors act under his instructions . It is with him that foreign ministers must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must never forget that he is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces of the United States . What this  | means the experience of the Central and South American republics has made constantly manifest . What it means , also , was shown by the decision of Franklin Roosevelt , in the spring of 1939 , to concentrate the major American fleet in the Pacific ; that has had a palpable influence at least upon the Japanese attitude to American interests in the Far East and possibly beyond that sphere . His ability to make " understandings " short of treaties counts for a good deal , as witness Theodore Roosevelt 's relations with japan and Panama and Santo Domingo . There is an immense authority latent in his power of recognition . I do not for a moment say that he has unlimited power ; pretty clearly , he must keep in step with the predominant public opinion he encounters . But I do not think that anyone can survey the record of those presidents who have deliberately sought influence in foreign affairs , and deny that he has immense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was true of Polk ; it was true of Cleveland ; it was true of Theodore Roosevelt and of Voodrow Wilson . I think it has been true , also , of Franklin Roosevelt . For I do nVt think it would be easy to deny that , in the momentous years since 1933 , the president 's attitude to the dictator-powers has carried immense weight with his people . He has trained them to an expectancy that he will act ; and they have been led to look to him for action . It has , no doubt , been true that he has not been able , as the debate over neutrality legislation has made clear , to persuade them as far as he himself would probably have wished . But what I  | think the historian will observe in the record is the fact that each of his initiatives in these years has widened the gulf between the support he can elicit and that gained by those in opposition to him . He may lose , as it were , particular battles ; he retains , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the campaign . Partly , that is the outcome of his persistence . He is at the task every day ; the attention of his opponents is continually diverted by other interests . Partly , also , and very importantly , the play of the drama is on his side . I le can see , as his opponents can not see , several moves ahead iii the maneuver for position . He has the papers ; he engages t lie conversations ; he can strike at the moment when emotions grow hot . It is immensely important , as a psychological factor in the exercise of his potential power , that at each pivotal moment in the drama people ask : " What is the United States going to do ? " And that is , in effect , to ask what the president is going to do . So long as this remains the case , he is bound , almost , to give some sort of lead . The authority at his disposal is immense and elastic . He is in the position in which his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refusal to play a part was not merely his personal abdication but that of the United States also . So that , in effect , its prestige is embodied in him . He can loose , and he can be sure that he can loose , the immense forces behind that prestige . He may , indeed , later on pay the price for loosing them , as Woodrow Wilson did over the rejection of the Peace of Versailles . And I do not for a moment deny that he courts  | defeat by the risks he has to take . My point is the different one that he is compelled by his position to take the risks , and that , if in his judgment it is wise to take them , it is improbable that anyone can say him nay . " The transaction of business with foreign powers , " to repeat Jefferson 's phrase , " is executive altogether . " Because that is the case , all the fundamental relations in the building of foreign policy arc in his hands . It is a field in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts upon which it is difficult to go back . In no other part of American political life has the separation of powers counted for so little as in the definition of this part . This is a conclusion too rarely emphasized in the books . Attention , especially since the famous struggle over the Peace of Versailles , has been concentrated on the treaty-making power of the Senate ; and the heaviest artillery that academic research could concentrate has been trained on the exercise of that power .

Corwin , The President 's Control of Foreign Relations ( 1917 ) .  | Senate has interfered with the foreign policy of the executive , not only by outright rejection of treaties , but by its exercise of the right to amend them after long and complicated negotiations , not least in the case of multilateral instruments . There has been vociferous complaint of long , and often vexatious , delay .

Solllet iincs , Senate action has been traced to hitter and , it is argued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Wilson over the Versailles ' l'rcaty has been most often cited , itl recent years , as the worst example of such partisanship . Sometimes it is traced to the determination of the Senate to enhance its prestige in foreign affairs , at the expense of the executive , and whatever may be the consequences of its action . Sometimes the relation is blamed on the fact that the necessity of a two-thirds majority of those voting is necessary for " approval and consent " ; and it is argued that the result of this requirement is , in fact , to make a minority of the Senate the masters of the fate of a proposed treaty . It is urged that , not seldom , the senators are themselves far less well informed about the subject matter they decide than those whom they embarrass by their action ; and they yield , it is said , to all kinds of pressure from interests ? personal , national , economic ? in reaching a decision . The whole process is urged as unsatisfactory . It means that the president of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate with the certainty either  | that , even if it is reasonable , it will be ratified at all , or that it will emerge , if approved , with amendments that are likely to be approved by the other contracting party involved .

" " I have told you many times , " wrote John Hay , in 1898,7 " that I did not believe another important treaty would ever pass the Senate . " It is even argued that the present status of the treaty-making power is a handicap to the influence of the United States in foreign affairs , by reason of the uncertainties it creates , and that the operation of the present mechanism has deprived her of great opportunities that would otherwise have been available . The critics of the present system have , undoubtedly , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what truth it contains , it is important to sec that case in its proper perspective . The most careful estimate of the statistical aspect of the problem was made by the Department of State in 1935 . Of 969 treaties submitted between 1789 and 1934 , 682 have been accepted by the Senate ; 173 have been amended ; 15 have been rejected by it . ' But , as Professor Dangerfield has shown , 9 of those so amended , the amendments in nearly 59 per cent were insignificant , and in 23 per London Times , January 31 , 1920. footnote 7 W. R. Thayer , Life of John Hay ( 1912 ) , II , 170 . B llaynes , op. cit. , II , 603. 8 Dangerfield , op. cit. , p. 170.  | cent were only moderate in character ; vital amendments relate to 18 per cent of the treaties submitted for Senate approval . It is worth noting that , of the treaties submitted , fewer were rejected than the number ( 53 ) which , after unconditional approval by the Senate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the treaties submitted were ratified within three months , and over 92 per cent were ratified within seven months . Only forty treaties remained without action by the Senate for a period of over a year.11 Certain other considerations arc important . Many of the proposed extradition treaties , for example , have been amended by the Senate in the light of its persistent refusal to allow extradition to a foreign country for political offenses ; in the light of the history of the national composition of the United States , that is a wholly defensible outlook . The famous delay of twenty-one years in the approval of the well-known Isle of Pines Treaty was due to the strong opposition to it of thousands of American citizens who had , under dubious circumstances , been induced to buy land there in the belief that the island would remain under the American flag.12 Some delay is attributable to the fact that no member of the Senate was particularly interested in securing approval . There are important cases where the president was of one political complexion and the Senate of another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , p. 91. 11 Dangerficid , op. cit. , p. 94. 12 Dangerfield , op. cit. , Chap . V.  | important cases , the arbitration treaties , for example , where the subject matter was complex and the existence of widely divergent views about the wisdom of approval easily intelligible . There are cases where the maladroit handling by the secretary of state ? John Hay is a notable example of this maladroitness ? was pivotal in the Senate 's attitude . There are cases , further , in which the importance of the subject matter wholly justified either the most scrupulous examination , and therefore delay , and , because of genuine differences about the wisdom of the treaty in the form presented , rejection , or approval only after what Professor Dangerfield calls " vital " reservations . Nor can it be denied that , in many cases , consideration by the Senate has forced the president to further negotiations with the other contracting parties which have resulted in what , from an American angle , is a much more advantageous treaty . And it is at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept the general arbitration treaties which Mr. IIay had negotiated would have taken from the Senate a power of approval which , rightly or wrongly , was conferred upon it by the Constitution.13 It is not , I think , a very powerful argument against the Senate 's present power to say that it leaves foreign states in some uncertainty about the outcome of negotiations . It is the business of a foreign state to know the implications of the American Constitution ; that is , so to say , a condition precedent to any negotia- footnote 13 Cf. Haynes , op. cit. , p. 6r6 , and the important quotation from the report of the Committee on Foreign Relations in 1911.  | tion with the United States . The statistical evidence , moreover , shows that the overwhelming bulk of treaties emerged either wholly unscathed from the ordeal of senatorial examination , or only partially scathed . And it is notable that , Russia apart , " the Senate delays less on those treaties signed with countries with which our diplomatic intercourse is most frequent . ' ' " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan , the average is just under eight weeks ? not , I think , an excessive period for the detailed examination of the outcome of what is usually prolonged diplomatic interchange . I am not for a moment denying the force of certain criticisms I propose to consider later . Here I am concerned to note only that those who have attacked the Senate have rarely built their argument on all the facts involved . And account must be taken of the position occupied by the Senate in the constitutional structure of the United States . Rightly or wrongly , the founders associated the Senate with the process of treaty ratification . Whether , as Pierce Butler said , " it was their intention that the president should consult the Senate throughout the process of negotiation , it is no longer possible to say . History , in the first instance , and the size of the modern Senate in the second , have made that directness of relation impracticable ; it is certainly true that the modern president clings strongly to his prerogative of being the sole effective agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dangerficld , op. cit. , p. 102. 15 Cf. Dangerficld , op. cit. , p. 33.  | has proved satisfactory . Eleven presidents , for instance , have sought to safeguard themselves from rebuff by asking senatorial advice upon the desirability of entering upon a proposed negotiation.18 That has had general helpfulness ; but it still leaves open the fact that a proposal to negotiate upon a subject is very different from a judgment upon the result of a negotiation . Other presidents have tried to assist themselves either by the means of appointing the proposed agents of negotiation , or by influencing the Senate through appointing its own members as part of the negotiating commission . There is no doubt that this has helped , both to secure approval , and to abridge the delay in securing approval . But it has not solved the central problem . It has avoided the kind of difficulty created by the appointment of executive agents in treaty-making without senatorial consent ; 1 ? but it has not touched the real issue of the substance of the treaty made and the Senate 's duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in classic terms by Mr. Justice Davis . " In this country , " he said , 20 " a treaty is something more than a contract , for the Federal Constitution declares it to be the law of the land . I f so , before it can become a law , the Senate in whom rests the power to ratify it , must agree to it . But the Senate are not required to adopt or reject it as 18 Haynes , op. cit. , p. 590. 1 ? For a good discussion of these difficulties sec Professor H. M. Wriston 's admirable book , Executive Agents in American Foreign Relations ( 1929 ) , esp . pp. 237-258 , and 292-308. 20 Haver v. Maker ( 1869 ) 9 Wall . 32.  | a selected group of senators , especially with the members of the Foreign Relations Committee . He may appoint one or more senators as members of a negotiating commission . Ike has the means of associating Congress at an early stage with any policy of treatymaking upon which he proposes to embark ; as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a possible commission and thus obtains implicit approval for the line of action involved . But it is broadly true to say that , in the vast majority of instances , the actual process of negotiation is so wholly executive in character that the Senate is unaware of the results , except in a general way , until the treaty is actually in its hands for consideration . On any showing , the right of the Senate to examine fully and independently any treaty that comes before it is beyond question . It takes that function seriously ; and none of its critics , I presume , would wish this to be otherwise . The real problem lies in the cumbersome nature of the machinery involved , on the one hand ; and on the other , in the fact that the very idea of the separation of powers leads each party to the treaty-making process to seek to exalt its own role . This , I think , emerges most fully in the struggle between President Wilson and the Senate over the approval of the Peace of Versailles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the kind of party appeal he did for a Congress that would enable him to make his own kind of peace . It was at least unwise of him to refuse to associate any members of the Senate with the American delegation to the Peace Con-  | ference . It was still more unwise to boast that he had made the kind of treaty which made acceptance of American association with the League of Nations inevitable of Senate acceptance . In short , the whole tragic history of the Versailles Treaty was , in the context of the record of the treaty-making power , nothing so much as a wanton defiance of the Senate by the president which , in the light of the fact that he had lost his majority there , was certain to be met with equal defiance . ' That Senator lodge , the leader of the opposition to Mr. Wilson in the Senate , was moved by the meanest personal considerations in the excesses to which he allowed himself to go is , of course , made plain by the amazing letter to Mr. Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conference began to sit . 17 But , unjustifiable as was the partisanship he displayed , it is , I suggest , undeniable that there was bitter partisanship , also , on the president 's side . The truth is that the treaty-making power displays the whole American scheme of government at its worst . It multiplies all the difficulties that are inherent in the separation of powers . It provides a channel for institutional expression to every form of personal and political antagonism that has developed during the president 's term of office . It heightens the natural tendency of every legislature to expand its power at the expense of the executive . None of the expedients that have been suggested for mitigating its acerbities footnote 16 Cf. Holt , op. cit. , pp. 249-308. 17 Allan Nevins , Henry White ( 1930 ) , pp. 353-354.  | a whole , but may modify it or amend it . " There are certain clear advantages in the position .

It insures a full public discussion of any proposed treaty independently of those who have negotiated it . The very fact , moreover , of the need for the Senate 's approval compels the president , in every important instance , to elicit a public opinion upon the desirability of his policy ; from this angle , it may be said that the debates in the Senate over the Peace of Versailles probably had an enormous effect in awakening the people of the United States to their responsibilities as a worldpower .

This has been well put by Senator Lodge . " A British secretary of state for foreign affairs , " he wrote , " " . . . ought to realize that the Senate can only present its views to a foreign government by formulating them in the shape of amendments which a foreign government may accept , or reject , or meet with counter-propositions , but of which it has no more right to complain than it has to the offer of any germane proposition at any other stage of the negotiation .

Our present system leads to utter weakness , muddle and delay ; it forces both sides to play politics , and instead of meeting the issue squarely , to indulge in a vast controversy over the prerogatives of two co-ordinate branches of the government . The deadlock between the executive and the Senate every footnote 22A Fighting Frigate ( 1902 ) , p. 224. 23 Woodrow Wilson and the World Settlement ( 1922 ) , I , 316.  | time we face a really critical foreign problem is intolerable . It not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future world-crisis may ruin us . " These are strong words ; and it is worth while , I think , to examine them with some particularity . Mr. Baker , of course , was writing as the official exponent of Woodrow Wilson 's policy , and sonic allowance must be made for his natural indignation at its rejection by the Senate . Broadly , it can not seriously be said that , on most major nutters , the policy of the United States has lacked a sufficient power to make itself felt in the politics of world-power . It has applied the Monroe Doctrine with irresistible force in the American hemisphere . Its policy of the " open door " has been a dominating consideration in the politics of all other powers in the Far East . Its impact on Europe , as the War of 1914 and its aftermath made clear , has been continuously profound ; no small part , particularly , of British foreign policy has been motivated by the determination of successive prime ministers to keep in step with American purposes , and any failure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear , has led to bitter criticism from the opposition . Nor do I think that anyone who examines the record since Grover Cleveland can doubt that , in general , the United States has been able to make its purposes known both " promptly " and with no more undivided power than any country built upon a system of representative government . There is lacking , it is true , the swiftness and unity of the dictatorial powers ; but that is precisely because states built upon  | the principles of representative government must take account of the reactions of public opinion before their executives act . And Mr. Baker , I assume , would not have it otherwise . The real pith of his attack lies in his assertion that treaty-making as such invites a controversy between the executive and the legislature . There is substance in this contention , though it must be noted that the invitation is not confined to the treaty-making power only but extends over the whole area of American government . Mr. Baker 's argument is really a plea that the Senate should accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Upon this view there are two things to be said . First , that the Constitution deliberately provides for equality , and it would , therefore , require a constitutional amendment to attain that end , an amendment unlikely to be secured except after a formidable struggle ; and second , that it is asking too much of any legislature to abdicate voluntarily front the exercise of powers upon which a considerable part of its prest ige depends . It is worth remembering , moreover , that the Senate has not seldom been as right as the president in its interpretation of what public opinion demanded . Certainly its view of Grant 's proposal to take over Santo Domingo , its refusal to accept , in 1868 , the purchase of the Danish West Indies , and even its rejection of the Peace of Versailles , may be said to have been in public accord with the sentiment of the time . Mr. Baker can not argue that a treaty ought to be confirmed merely because the president has approved  | it ; presidents have themselves often decided to withdraw treaties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth noting that the power of making executive agreements not of treaty status ? of which the reciprocal agreements of 1882 and 1896 with 1lexico are examples24 ? gives any president a wide discretion of which full advantage has been taken . In a generation , for example , twenty agreements settling claims of American citizens for injuries to their propert v were made executively , without reference to the approval of the Senate.2J The Boxer Protocol of 1901 was so arranged ; as was the well-known exchange of notes between Mr. Root , as secretary of state , and Karon Takahira , in 1908 ; SO , despite the discussions it provoked , was the Lansing-Ishii agreement of 1917 . None of these was submitted to the Senate . Frequently , also , despite Senate hostility , the president has acted as though an agreement had been made , in matters of grave moment , which was likely to become a treaty . Theodore Roosevelt has given a remarkable account in his Autobiography of one instance of this attitude on the part of the president . Speaking of the proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dominican debts , foreign and domestic , " he describes how " I went ahead and administered the proposed treaty anyhow , considering it as a simple agreement on the part of the executive which would be converted into a treaty whenever the 2 footnote 4 Cf.

After a couple of years , the Senate did act , having previously made some utterly unimportant changes which I ratified and persuaded Santo Domingo to ratify . . . . The Constitution did not explicitly give me power to bring about the necessary agreement with Santo Domingo . But the Constitution did not forbid what I did .

" He can , in fact , whether by executive agreement or as commander-in-chief , virtually commit the United States to war ; and his power to influence congressional action in this regard may easily reduce it to the shadow of its intended substance . On the evidence , in short , it is ludicrous to represent the president as an embarrassed phantom in the realm of foreign affairs . Roughly , he may be said to be just as strong as the public opinion he is able to footnote " Autobiography ( 1919 ) , pp. 551-552. 27 Messages of the Presidents , IV , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , XL , 1423-1424.  | elicit for his policies . The complaints of the critics are , I suggest , largely misplaced , except upon the assumption that the treaty-making power is to be differently exercised than any other part of the Senate 's prerogatives . It is important , further , in any assessment of the exercise of this power to remember not only that foreign affairs are more complicated in the twentieth century than they were in the nineteenth , but that the need for popular control in foreign affairs was intended to be one of the features which distinguished the American from other constitutions . It has to be remembered that most of the really important treaties which have been either modified or defeated raised issues of great significance upon which real differences of opinion were , to say the least , permissible . On the arbitration treaties , for example , the Senate 's attitude has been shared by important interests in Great Britain ; it is notable that the Labor government of Great Britain , in adhering to the optional clause , only did so with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its value ; and this was true , also , of British adherence to the Kellogg-Briand pact . The real target of criticism has been the two-thirds rule . " The irreparable mistake of our Constitution , " wrote John Hay , 29 " puts it into the power of onethird + I of the Senate to meet with a categorical veto any treaty negotiated by the president , even though it may have the approval of nine-tenths of the people of the nation . " There is great weight in this footnote 29 Letter of August 18 , 1899 . Thayer , op. cit. , II , 219.  | view . It helps enormously any group of senators , even an individual , hostile to some treaty upon grounds quite irrelevant to its substance , to organize opposition to it with some hope that it may be successful . This senator is opposed to the treaty because he dislikes the state with which it is being made ; that senator hopes , by his opposition , to please a strong religious or national element in his constituency ; another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success being accredited to the president of the other party ; another , again , may be on bad terms with the president of his own party and use this means of expressing the fact . Yet even this criticism may be pushed too far . The subject matter of most treaties does not easily lead to popularity for the senator opposing it ; except upon the largest issues it is doubtful whether such opposition arouses any widespread interest at all . I doubt , for instance , whether there is any evidence that a senator 's attitude on the convention of 1883 ( which was rejected for lack of a twothirds majority ) with Mexico for the retrying of claims created any strong feeling about him among the people of the United States . And it has been shown that of all the treaties submitted to the Senate , none failed of approval because of the two-thirds vote before 186o , and only twelve between that date and 19 3 5 . " Of the twelve it is difficult , says Professor Fleming , to regard more than two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 30 Haynes , op. cit. , II , 659. footnote  | others " would have notably improved our relations with a foreign state ? ' The case against the two-thirds rule is , however , a substantial one on another ground . It is important because of what may be termed its prenatal effects . The knowledge that a little bloc of recalcitrant senators may hold up or modify a wise proposal has adverse effect both upon the prospect of embarking upon it and upon the process of negot iat ion itself . This has been well put by ilr . I ) e Witt ( : linton Poole , himself an American diplomat of lone experience . " The record , " he writes , ' " does not show from what wise measures the president or his secretary has been estopped by perhaps unfounded fear of what a few senators may do , nor is it demonstrable into what brusque and harmful actions the spectre on Capitol Hill has frightened them . In the light of my own reading and my own experience in Washington , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one , I think , can read the correspondence and diaries of presidents and secretaries of state without the sense that this is largely true . Anyone who reads , to take the supreme instance only , the detailed story of President Wilson 's negotiations at Versailles can hardly avoid the conclusion that at each stage of his activities the shadow of Senator Lodge dogged his footsteps like an evil fate , and was not without responsibility for many of Wilson 's blunders both before and after the treaty was made . footnote 31 The Treaty Veto of the American Senate , p. 304. 2 Haynes , op. cit. , p. 661.  | The case , therefore , for a revision of the two-thirds rule is , I think , a clear one . Before we consider possible alternatives , however , there is one general remark that it is worth while to make . No critic of the present form of the treaty-making power suggests its confinement to the hand of the executive alone . In the light both of American and of foreign experience I think this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance , or Polk , or Theodore Roosevelt , or Woodrow Wilson , might easily have taken the United States into dubious foreign adventures for which public opinion was unprepared , for which , also , there would have been little justification , had it not been for the knowledge that the Senate would ultimately review the results of their activities . " The spectre on Capitol Hill " may have frightened them into many " brusque and harmful actions " ; it is , I think , equally unquestionable that it has frightened them out of many they might otherwise have attempted . A president eager for imperialist adventure , or concerned to exercise influence in Europe in a particular direction , might easily , in the absence of Senate control , be a source of grave danger to the American people . And this view is , I suggest , reinforced by experience of systems like that of Great Britain where the control of foreign affairs is , in fact , " executive altogether . " For the only real control of the House of Commons is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabinet with a fait accompli , rejection of which involves the defeat of the government and a subsequent general election .  | There is no instance in modern times where the government has had an assured majority , upon which its supporters have been willing to take that risk . The result is that the executive in Great Britain has a primacy in foreign affairs so assured that , save where a leakage gives public opinion ? as in the I loare-Laval incident ? an unexpected knowledge of events , it has little reason to trouble itself about the impact of foreign affairs upon the I louse of ( ; onuuons . The only real limit to its powers is the decision exercised by the voters at a subsequent general elect ion ; and that decision , as in the case of the doctrine of nonintervention in Spain , or the sacrifice of Ciecho-Slovakia at Munich in 1938 , may come too late to affect the results of the government 's policy . What , therefore , is in dispute in the United States is not the desirability of legislative control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the critics ; it is the narrower question of the method by which that legislative control should be secured . Some suggest that a simple majority of the Senate should suffice for the confirmation of a treaty ; others suggest that the House of Representatives should be joined with the treaty-making power and that , as with a declaration of war , a majority in both houses should suffice for confirmation . This , it is interesting to note , was the method proposed by James Wilson in the constitutional convention , though only Pennsylvania voted for its adoption there ; and it has recently been approved by an eminent Democratic candidate for the presidency , who has also had ambassadorial experi-  | encc , Mr. John W. Davis . " It has been suggested that , for the purpose of confirmation , both houses might meet as a single assembly ; and Mr. S. W. McCall , at one time a well-known congressman , has urged that the treaty-making power should be transferred wholly to the House of Representatives on the ground that its frequency of re-election brings it nearer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public opinion is upon issues of foreign policy 34 Professor Dangerfield , at the close of his illuminating and elaborate examination of the treaty-making powers , will have none of these proposals . He suggests the creation of a special Foreign Relations Cabinet to consist of " the secretary of state , the under-secretary of state , a senior drafting officer , the chairman and the ranking minority members of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs . " " Such a cabinet , " he writes , " ) " would combine the experts of the Department , and the political leaders of both houses who deal with foreign affairs . " Of these proposals , the most logical is obviously the transference of the . treaty-making power to a majority of both houses of Congress . This homologates the peace-making control of foreign policy with that involved in the making of war ; and it has the further advantage , which is important , of associating with footnote " Haynes , op. cit. , p. 661 . Mr. W. J. Bryan and Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantic Monthly ( Sept. 1920 ) , p. 395 . I have been unable to find any other supporter of Mr. McCall 's proposal . 35 Dangerfield , op. cit. , p. 321 . Professor Dangerfield points out that this proposal was first made by Professor Quincy Wright in his Control of Foreign Relations , p. 371.  | treaty-making that branch of the legislature which has to implement any appropriations necessary for treaty fulfilment . I do not think it is a serious objection that the House is now a large body ; the Senate itself has never been small enough to act as a presidential council . It is , of course , a difficulty that the House may be of a different political complexion from that of the Senate , and that this may , in in ) portant instances , lead to a deadlock ; but since the same situation already exists as between the Senate and the president , I do not think this can be regarded as an insuperable objection . It may be , as Mr. 1 layden has noted , ' that the method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the treaty to amendment or reservation by both branches of Congress , with adjustments by compromise in conference committee . " But this , in any case , is an experience with which the president is familiar , and it raises no obstacle that is not inherent in the ordinary legislative process of the United States . It is a better proposal , I think , than that of simply abolishing the two-thirds rule in the Senate for several reasons . Both houses are concerned in foreign affairs ; it is therefore appropriate that both should have an equal relevance to them . And where a bicameral system based on popular election exists , it is illogical to exclude one chamber from direct concern with a fundamental branch of policy . The proximity , moreover , of the House of Representatives to election would render it valuably accessible to public footnote 86 Hayden , op. cit. , II , 661.  | opinion in those issues upon which ? they are rare ? a strong public opinion can be formed . I do not think there is much to be said for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility where it is least desirable to divide it ? at the place where initiative must be taken and the process of negotiation begun . It jeopardizes secrecy and dispatch , especially in those periods where Congress is not in session . It raises grave difficulties for the president in every instance where the Congress , or one house of it , happens not to be of his political complexion . It would make his own relations to his secretary of state no easy matter ; and it might easily divide the latter 's allegiance between the president and the two chairmen , as well as the ranking minority members , of the respective congressional committees . It is , no doubt , true that where the Congress members of such a cabinet supported the treaty , they would be able to recommend it in Congress with more expertise than at present ; Inn it is , on the other hand , also obvious that , vv1hcre they opposed it , the passage of the treaty would thereby be rendered more difficult . " llhe evidence Professor Dangerfield has himself so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate may be helpful in securing the rapid consideration of a treaty , it is very far from being decisive where confirmation is concerned . Most of the advantages urged by Professor Dangerfield for his proposal arc already  | open to the president in other ways ; and one who , like McKinley , has shown that he is skilful in handling the Senate , can obviously take full advantage of them . The dangers of the proposal seem to me to outweigh its advantages . It Multiplies the present prospect of legislative encroaelnu ? nt upon the president 's power , especially in the twilight zone of executive agreements and in that complicated area involved in his functions as coninlander-in-chief . It hampers his initiative , especiali where he is dealing with a Congress dominated by the opposition party . It offers , also , it is worth adding , manifold opportunities for the kind of action Senator I , odge thought fit to make in the prelude to the Peace Conference of Versailles . A foreigner may consider the alternatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide between them . I am satisfied to point out that , in my own judgment , the case against the Senate has been enormously overestimated . I do not for a moment deny that an inherent jealousy of the executive , purely partisan objections , and even personal spite , have entered into the senatorial exercise of its power . Weighing all these , I still think that , somewhere in the legislature of the United States , a power of this kind should , in the face of all its difficulties , be lodged . Despite its extent , the authority of the president in foreign affairs remains immense ; he is , on any showing , the motive-power of the whole system . It has one great result which is not attained in anything like a proportionate degree in other systems , and , most notably , not attained in  | the British system : it enforces upon the president the obligation to give reasons for what he is doing . He is compelled to educate public opinion ; he can not drive it . There is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case against what he is doing will not only be fully stated , but that , at each stage of his activities , he will be forced to take account of that case . Not seldom , in the conflicts that have arisen , the Senate has been perverse and mistaken ; but , not seldom also , the president has been perverse and mistaken too . The system leaves room , as room should be left , for wide presidential initiative ; but , very wisely I think , it makes the success of that initiative largely dependent upon the power of the president to maintain his hold upon public opinion . In a democracy , I think it is right that this should be the case . An Englishman , to take a concrete case , may well regret , in the light of its aftermath , the Senate 's rejection of the Peace of Versailles . But anyone who compares the process of its ratification in the Senate , on the one hand , and in the I louse of Commons , on the other , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there is to be democracy in foreign affairs , the principle which underlies the American system is by far superior to the principle which underlies the British . I can not , further , avoid the opinion that the large superiority in the reporting of foreign news in the American press , as compared with the British , is not unconnected with the fact that the basic principle of control is in the one case democratic , while in the other it is aristocratic . It is not insignificant , in the  | postwar years , that much discussion has been devoted in Great Britain to the problem of democratizing the control of foreign policy . I would not , for a moment , say that the problem has been solved in the United States . But it is , I think , beyond doubt that the American safeguards against executive unwisdom ? I use a neutral word ? arc an improvement of profound importance upon anything that Europe has so far evolved . I turn to a very different , if connected , aspect of the president 's relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nominating power . 1 Ic has the sole right to submit names for its approbation ; but the Senate is wholly free to confirm or to reject the choice he makes . The idea of the founders was , no doubt , to prevent the president from building up an unbreakable executive power . It was assumed that the merit of the proposed appointee would be the one issue with which the Senate would concern itself . " It could hardly happen , " wrote Alexander Hamilton , 37 " that the majority of the Senate would feel any other complacency towards the object of an appointment than such as the appearances of merit might inspire , and the proofs of the want of it destroy . " Rarely has the failure of a prophecy by a great man been more complete . From the beginning of Washington 's administration , the Senate 's share in the power of appointment has been , in its essence , exercised in footnote 37 The Federalist , No. 66.  | part for party purposes , and in part on personal grounds . The senatorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by the time , at any rate , of Andrew Jackson the system so gracefully called " senatorial courtesy " was well established . It has been happily defined by Professor Lindsay Rogers . " Senatorial courtesy , " he writes , 33 " is a kind of liberum veto , ' and means no more than this : that while the Senate will not suggest particular nominations , it expects that the president , in naming certain local office-holders ( e.g. , postmasters and collectors of the customs ) , will choose persons satisfactory to the senator or senators of the president 's political party from the state in which the offices arc located , or from which the appointees come . The strength of the pack is the wolf , and the strength of the wolf is the pack ' ; consequently , if senators are ignored , or if their objections arc flouted , the Senate in most cases will not approve the nominations . It is difficult to speak with decision about a scheme of appointment the range of which is constantly changing . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that , nowadays , the Senate has a contingent veto power over something like i 8,000 appointments . " Some of them it will usually accept without question . It is customary to agree to the president 's choice of his cabinet ; though this has not always been the case . Madison was compelled to withdraw the name of Gallatin for the post of secretary of state merely because Senator Smith had a brother for whom he footnote 38 Lindsay Rogers , The American Senate ( 1926 ) , p. 25.  | coveted the place ; 39 and I have already referred to the rejection of Mr. Coolidge 's nomination ? on quite intelligible grounds ? of Charles B. Warren as his attorney-general . But , as a rule , the Senate realizes that where cabinet posts are in question it is desirable for the president to have his own way ; after all , he knows best the team with which he can live . Much the same is true of ambassadors , though even here objection has been taken to appointments in an indefensible way ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia , of Van Buren , who resit*ned the secretaryship of state to go to London , of Norman Hapgood , who had been nominated to Denmark by President Wilson , are all cases of this kind . Yet , again , proportionately speaking the Senate has not been too ungenerous , perhaps on occasion even excessively gracious , to presidential nominations to diplomatic posts . It is in the other realms of appointment that the exercise of this power is seen at its worst . It has both a negative and a positive side . On the negative side , the worst type of rejection is that in which a senator bases his opposition merely on the ground that the proposed appointee is " personally obnoxious " to him . Senator Gallinger , of New Hampshire , after a struggle lasting over two years , prevented the nomination of a distinguished lawyer , Mr. George Rublee , to the Federal Trade Commission solely on this basis.4o Senator Hoar has given us an account of a nomination ssHenry Adams , The Life of Albert Gallatin ( 1879 ) , p. 391. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | by President Grant made under circumstances so dubious that it may well have been the cause of Grant 's failure to secure a third term 41 The famous struggle over the collectorship of the Port of New York between Garfield and Roscoe Conkling is well known . And we have been told by Polk of the amazing nonchalance with which senatorial recommendations are too often made to the president , which he has rarely any alternative but to accept . The power is exercised ruthlessly right up to nominations for the Supreme Court . Between 1789 and 1938 the Senate has been responsible for the withdrawal of 21 nominations out of 109 submitted to it ? practically 20 per cent . " It is impossible , of course , to doubt that there have been occasions when the power of veto has been wisely used . Bad presidential nominations are not , alas , rare ; and Senate debates like those on the appointment of Mr. IIughes as chief justice of the United States ? he was confirmed by 52 votes to 26 ? or that as a result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejected , serve a useful purpose in reminding the president of the importance of remembering the qualities for which he ought to look in an appointee to the bench . But , frankly , it is the exception rather than the rule for the Senate , even in the case of the Supreme Court , to make an impersonal assessment of qualifications . The important things are the purchase of support by the presi- footnote i1 Hoar , op. cit. , I , 212 . ' ? Warren , The Supreme Court in United States History ( 1922 ) , Vol . III , Appendix .  | dent from among his own party , and the effort of the senator to see that his relation to the distribution of patronage is effective in consolidating his own position in the political life of the state . The misery through which a president must pass in effecting that distribution must be seen to be believed . I Ic may , like Theodore Roosevelt , take high ground about the standards he proposes to maintain ; " experience of the actual operation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not myself think that the problem the issue presents is at all an easy one . There can be no sort of doubt but that the Senate , especially in relation to the practice of " courtesy " has gravely abused its power . But there can be little doubt that , left unimpeded by the prospect of a senatorial veto , the president 's abuse of his patronage would be equally grave . As the system stands at present , it is , I think , fair to say that public opinion will compel some real degree of judicial-mindedness in the case of appointments to the Supreme Court and certain commissions like that on interstate commerce and the tariff ; this is not necessarily the case , but there is at least a probability that it will be so because there is likely to be a special public interested in , and watchful of , the quality and fitness of the men who arc chosen to fill them . Once , however , we leave those posts on which the eyes of the nation are fixed , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corn-4 footnote 3 J. B. Bishop , Theodore Roosevelt ( 1920 ) , I , 157 , and cf. pp. 235 , 248 , 442.  | peting for the party and personal advantages that can be secured by its exercise . The obvious thing for an Englishman to say is that before the reforms of 1870 the patronage system in Great Britain was also mean and sordid ; that , with the coming of the merit system , a wholly different character has been given to political appointments , and that the United States can end this problem by the simple method of replacing the spoils system by the merit system . I do not think the problem is as simple as this suggests . Political parties are real and obstinate things which have to be kept alive . In Great Britain we have largely ? not wholly ? removed the virus of patronage from the world of the civil service . But we have replaced it , so far as rewarding political service is concerned , by an immense extension of the system of political " honors , " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace has become , in the overwhelming number of cases , a reward for party service . To some extent this is true , also , of appointments to the high Court ; ' ' and it obtains in relation to a small , but important , number of colonial governorships . And hardly a royal commission is nominated but some of the appointments to which are explicable only by the desire of the prime minister or his cabinet colleague to reward a political friend . With the growth , too , of public corporations like the British Broadcasting Corporation and the London Passenger Transport Board , there has been , in recent years , a significant increase in the paid patronage at the government 's dis- footnote 44 Cf. my Studies in Law and Politics ( 1932 ) , Chap . 7.  | posal ; and it is well known that directorships on the board of the Suez Canal Company ? as well paid a sinecure as there is in the disposal of the British government ? have always been used to reward the higher forms of political service . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open to the president by the fiat of the Constitution ; and a political party without this source of reward would find itself in a difficult position . There can be no doubt that much of the work which , in ( ; teat Britain , is held worthy of a peerage or a knighthood , is , iii the United States , rewarded with an ambassadorship or the lucrative collectorship of a great customs port . To abolish this system would be to dig deep into the foundations of party politics . The disturbance to the national and to local political machines would be immense , and it is by no means easy to predict the consequences that would follow . It is not enough , I think , merely to say that the patronage system must end . Is it to end on the senatorial side , or the presidential , or both ? For let us clearly recognize that it is an evil for which both sides are equally responsible . Since Jackson 's time , at any rate , no president has had any compunction in using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Congress , and at least since then there have been few senators who have failed to use the influence the power of confirmation brings with it to assure their position in their constituencies . To make the whole system of appointment one based , like the British system , wholly on merit , might easily have two dangerous consequences . On the one  | hand , it might easily jeopardize the president 's power to force through necessary or useful measures by depriving him of one of the most important sanctions of that power he now possesses . On the other , it might throw members of Congress , and especially members of the Senate , into a far greater dependence upon rich men and important interests , like the railroads and the public utilities , than is now the case . Neither , I think , would be a desirable result . Of one thing , certainly , I am sure . It would be a great mistake to abolish the power of the Senate over appointments , leaving the president the free hand he would then possess . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , above all in the hands of a weak man , that it would be certain to be indefensibly administered . You have only to remember the use to which Grant and Harding , even with the present safeguards , were prepared to put that power to see that this is the case . 1 do not suppose for a moment that it would citable anv president to build up an unbeatable machine of officeholders . But it would offer temptations of grave proportions to corrupt interests to secure the starling of the courts and the great commissions with men willing to exchange favors in return for appointments to place . Anyone who thinks , for example , of a Securities and Exchange Commission staffed by the creatures of Wall Street ; or of a National Labor Relations Board whose members shared the ideals of the National Association of Manufacturers ; or of an Interstate Commerce Commission incapable of detachment upon the thorny  | problems of railroad rates and railroad consolidations ; can at once see the dangerous vistas that are conjured up . The Senate has made its mistakes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , are manifold . But it has always contained a number of men , of whom the late Senator La Follette was outstanding in the last generation , and Senator Norris in our own , who have been the unpurchasable and relentless guardians of the public interest in appointments ; who have played , in short , the part that I Ianlilton assumed the Senate as a whole would play . It is a pity that there have not been more of such men . But , so long as such men are there , they act as watchdogs of the public in a way for which , granted the president 's power , nothing could compensate if it were abolished . I believe , therefore , that so long as the president 's unfettered power to nominate over the present wide range of personnel remains , so long also , with all its faults , the Senate 's power of approval must remain . I confess that I should like to see the range of the power limited to proportions more akin to British practice . I think the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gain and little to lose by removing as much as possible of its administrative personnel from the grip of the spoils system . But it must , on any realistic consideration , be admitted that this raises two grave problems . On the one hand , there is the issue of what compensating means the president is to have to retain his hold on Congress . On the other , there is the very difficult problem of how far precisely the limitation on his power to appoint is to go .  | The first problem goes down to the root of the American scheme of government . It is not enough to say that the president will still be able to appeal to public opinion , and that where he is right he will be victorious . This is to omit both the time factor and the power of propaganda in the modern world . Granted the separation of powers , I do not see that there can be any doubt that the less the president has to offer for the votes he receives , the less will be his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be the pressure of leadership he can exert . Let us remember that , at best , his leadership of the party is a fleeting phenomenon ; that he is dealing with innumerable local machines that are , at best , only partially responsive to his control ; that he has no such sanction at his disposal as the threat of dissolution ; that party discipline in the United States is , by reason of the separation of powers , much less rigid than it is in the European countries ; and it becomes clear that every serious deprivation of powers he may suffer is almost an invitation to Congress to move to usurpation in a sphere that should properly be his . My friend Professor Brogan , in his remarkable book , ' has urged at once the abolition of the senatorial power over appointment and the extension of the president 's authority . I agree that this would be achieved if the spoils system remained , and if the disposal of the system were to be solely a presidential prerogative . But if the spoils system , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against it is really unanswerable ? then the presi-4 footnote 5Government of the People ( 1933 ) , P. 382.  | dent 's position would be far weaker than it is today . For reasons I have already indicated , I do not believe the United States , at this period of its history , can afford weak presidents . " hlic dilemma thus presented is one that goes to the heart of the whole scheme of American institutions ; and I shall try to assess its significance at the end of this book . The second problem is , of course , a much narrower one ; but its importance can easily be overlooked . The British system of appointment has , in the last seventy years , succeeded in creating an administrative personnel of high duality and great influence . It has freed both the cabinet and members of Parliament from all the nauseating habits of a patronage system . But it has brought in its train serious problems of its own . It has , it is true , given the British people a civil service unsurpassed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent years particularly , raised the question whether the price that has been paid is not an absence of the spirit of invention , a want of imagination in seeing the need to open out new lines of state policy , which are of increasing importance . " It is one business to do what must be done , " wrote Sir Henry Taylor , 4e " another to devise what ought to be done . It is in the spirit of the British government , as hitherto existing , to transact only the former business . " I think that is still largely true . Where large-scale innovation has been attempted the impulse to it has usually been communicated from outside , and there have been too many occasions when its introduction has been , ably footnote 4a The Statesman ( ed. of 1924 ) , p. 113.  | and pertinaciously ? because civil servants at the top of their departments are able and pertinacious men ? resisted from within . The tradition of a civil service like that of Great Britain is to maximize the avoidance of blunders rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake , for which the future seems to call . In general , a British civil servant gets to a really influential position in his department after some twenty years ' service . By that time he has been habituated to a routine of thought which deprecates large-scale departure from the traditions to which he is accustomed . It requires a minister of very notable capacity to make headway against such an habituation . I suspect that the British civil service is very nearly the perfect instrument for the negative state . I think it has yet to be proved that it is , in its present form , adequate for the positive state , particularly for a positive state which requires immense administrative experimentalism if it is to adapt itself to a rapidly changing , perhaps to a revolutionary world.47 Something of this problem would inevitably confront an American president if his power over patronage were as largely abolished as that power has been abolished in Great Britain . Allowances would have to be made for its existence . A performing president would have to be sure not only that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but also of the necessary inventiveness and risk-taking . Is a stable civil service of the British kind compatible with these qualities ? My answer is that we do not yet footnote 47 Cf. my Parliamentary Government in England ( 1938 ) , Chap . 6.  | know ; and I think it worth while to record my own impression , based , I may venture to add , upon considerable investigation , that there has been more of these two vital qualities in Washington under Franklin Roosevelt than there has been in Whitehall for something like a generation . I do not deny that Whitehall produces these men ? Sir Robert Morant , for example ; 48 but when they emerge , they stand our like Mount Rainier amidst the surrounding range . I am satisfied to make it as clear as I can that any effort to deal with the ramifications of the civil service problem in the United States must at least bear these considerations in mind . On the one hand , to end the spoils system is to risk the pervasiveness of the president 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide him with a permanent civil service on the British model may well deprive him of the human instrumentalities he requires for large-scale change . The problem is of the proportions that call for the qualities of a Bentham . No one who speculates upon its implications can avoid seeing how they reach far into the foundations of the American commonwealth . It is in the degree that this is realized that it has the prospect of being met with prescience and imagination . The Senate has a clear power over appointments ; it has a less well-defined relation to removals from 48 Cf. B. Allen , Sir Robert Morant ( 1934 ) , and the last chapter of Sir George Newman 's A Century of Public Health ( 1939 ) ?  | office . That the consent of the Senate to removals would be necessary , Hamilton did not doubt ; 43 but Madison took a very different view . " If you say that a bad man in office , " he wrote , " " shall not be displaced but by and with the advice and consent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conduct of the officer ; all will depend upon the Senate . You hereby destroy a real responsibility without obtaining even the shadows . " From the outset of the republic grave fears have been expressed if the president were to have an uncontrolled power of removal ; though there was little in the record of the early presidents to justify such a fear and , in a considerable degree , as Professor Thach has pointed out , it is implicit in the general nature of executive power.51-The first great clash came under President Jackson ; and from that time onward , especially under President Johnson , the fires of controversy have waxed and waned . Cases like the removal of Duane , the secretary of the treasury , by Jackson , and the suspension of Stanton , the secretary of war , by Johnson , show the profundity of the authority claimed by the president ; while senatorial pressure to remove high officials , Gouverneur Morris , for instance , as minister to France , and Denby , as secretary of the navy under Coolidge , arc instances of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other side . A further problem arises as to the creation of offices . May Congress , in its wisdom , attach such conditions to footnote 49 The Federalist , No. 77. so Speech in the House of Representatives , May 19 , 1789. 51The Creation of the Presidency ( 1922 ) , p. 159.  | the creation of posts as to render a dismissal dependent upon its consent ? In Myers v. U. S. ' the Supreme Court , by a majority , held that the denial of an unrestricted power of removal to the president is unconstitutional ; though , on that occasion , both Mr. Justice Brandeis and Mr. Justice I lolines held that Congress was entitled to place what limitations on removal it pleased . But in Humphrey 's Executor v. U. S. " the Court seems to have narrowed t he area covered by the earlier decision and to have argued that where the post involved is not purely " cccutive , " and concerns a removal from an " independent agency " like the Interstate Connnercc Commission or the Federal Reserve Board , the Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president may act in removal , and that a removal outside these conditions would be illegal . There is a clear area of difficulty between the two cases ; and it can not yet be said , I think , that the legal position has been settled . My own view is that , so far as removals are concerned , there are two divisions of the problem to which different considerations apply . On the one hand , there are the ordinary executive agencies of the government . There , as I think , the president 's right to be unfettered in his discretion is unquestionable . His duty is the " faithful execution of the laws " ; he is entitled to the instruments he deems suitable to that execution . He may make mistakes ; he may act in a partisan way ; he may , as the Senate has so often feared , footnote 12 ( 1926 ) , 272 U. S. 52. sa ( 1935 ) , 295 U. S. 602.  | seek to use his authority to build up a personal machine . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this realm , really gain by an unwise exercise of his discretion . Wherever he dismisses an official , he has to make a new appointment ; and there is reason and to spare for supposing that the Senate will interpose its veto , as it did upon Roger Taney after the dismissal of Duane , whenever it thinks the presidential exercise has been unwarranted . So long as the official involved is carrying out a function for the proper exercise of which the president is ultimately responsible , I can not see that interference with that responsibility is desirable . In any political system , there is a point at which trust must be placed somewhere . It is of the essence of the American scheme that , for the executive process , trust should be placed in the president . It seems to me to follow from this that legislative interference with discretion in that trust is , if it reaches the point of prohibition , wholly undesirable . I do not mean , thereby , that Congress should be estopped front the expression of its opinion . Action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholly undesirable . " That is an expression of opinion upon which the president is free to act or to refrain from acting , as he pleases , though at his peril . In a way , a resolution such as was passed in the Denby case is like a vote of " no confidence " in a particular minister in the House of Commons . It does not , indeed , force the ministry out , as it would do in Great Britain . But footnote " For a good account of the Denby case see Haynes , op. cit. , II , 816 f.  | it serves the wholly admirable purpose of informing the president , and beyond him the people of the United States , that grave matters arc afoot , of which the legislature takes a serious view . I do not think such resolutions should be passed save in cases of exceptional momentousness . But the Denby case was such a one . Here , after all , was a cabinet minister at the least culpably negligent in an affair which led to the criminal prosecution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them . To argue , as Senator Borah did , that Congress has no right under the Constitution to pass such a resolut ion because the dismissal of a cabinet officer is not within its power ( save through the formal and unlikely process of impeachment ) is to take far too narrow a view of the legislative function . Criticism of the administration is inherent in that function , is , indeed , one of the most valuable services it can perform . To hinder its performance upon formal grounds is as harmful to the president himself as it may be to the interests it is his duty to serve . But the judges apart ( and they are separately provided for under the Constitution ) " it seems to me clear , also , that there is a type of governmental post in which , by its very nature , there ought to be safeguards against an unlimited presidential discretion to remove . There are posts , of which the Interstate Commerce Commission is the outstanding example , the holders of which are intended to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footnote 86 Art . III , Sec. i.  | that are not intended to be dealt with along the ordinary lines of the party battle . Here , I suggest , it is impossible to doubt that Congress both could and should prescribe the terms upon which removals from office may be made ; and of such a post as that of the comptroller-general of the United States , it seems to me obvious that accountability to Congress rather than to the president is desirable . " Sometimes the congressional desire to secure independence from the passing policy of the government of the day has been attempted by a deliberate demand for a bipartisan structure of the agency concerned . Where a president has sought to get round the statutory provision , as Mr. Coolidge did with Mr. D. J. Lewis , by asking for an " undated letter of resignation as the price for sending the reappointment to the Senate , " j7 his action seems to me wholly unjustifiable . A great deal of modern administration is of a quasi-judicial nature the quality of which depends upon public faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress should be entitled , in such cases , legislatively to safeguard as much of that impartiality as it can is , I think , beyond dispute . President Franklin Roosevelt , for example , wrote to Mr. Humphrey , of the Tariff Commission , requesting his resignation on the ground that " the aims and purposes of the Commission can be carried out most effectively with per- footnote 56 On posts of this character sec the admirable remarks of Professor Lindsay Rogers , op. cit. , pp. 45 f . His book contains also ( pp. 257-270 ) a valuable list of statutes restricting the power of the president to appoint or remove . 57 Rogers , op. cit. , p. 47.  | sonnel of my own selection " ; while , at the same time , he seems to have been wholly satisfied with the quality of Mr. Humphrey 's work . The statute creating the commission lays it down " that removals shall be for " inefficiency , neglect of duty , or malfeasance in office . " Since Mr. I luinphrey was charged with none of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could have been asked to resign . The case of Mr. 1 luniphrev is clearly distinguishable from that of I ) r . A. F. Illorgan , at the time of his removal the cltairnian of the board of the Tennessee Valley Authority. ? " 1 lore , there was definite evidence upon which the president was entitled to find that the attit ude of 1 ) r . Morgan to his colleagues made impossible the proper fulfilment of the authority 's function . The president held , personally , " hearings , " in which all the evidence necessary for a judgment was before him . His decision was , no doubt , an act of " discretion " ; but it was one which an average reasonable man was likely , in the circumstances , to find appropriate to the facts involved . This type of case , though it gave rise to a passionate debate in Congress , was clearly of a different order from that of Humphrey . In the latter 's case , there were no charges against the official . The president seems merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an administrative body composed of his own nominees . But since the very nature of the statute footnote 58 39 U. S. Stat. 795 . S. 700 . " For a full account of this case see the account of the president 's meetings with 1 ) r . Morgan , together with the opinion of the solicitorgeneral , in his message to Congress of March 23 , 1938 ?  | under which the commission operated was intended to prevent the president from having a discretion of this kind , I can not see any possible answer to the judgment of the Supreme Court ? unanimously affirmed ? that he did not possess it . For , in cases of the Humphrey type , the object of legislation is to offer the citizen a guarantee that the official is independent of the political executive in the view he forms upon its policies . It is as legitimate to safeguard that guarantee as it is to secure the tenure of a judge from executive interference . I agree that , where a vacancy occurs , the president is entitled , once he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to put forward men of his own way of thought rather than of that opposed to him . Such officials , like , indeed , members of the Supreme Court themselves , arc in that twilight area where the facts have to be seen from an angle that , so far as is humanly possible , transcends the individual limitations of judgment . just as a justice of the Supreme Court ought not- to find a statute unconstitutional just because he thinks it unwise , so a member of one of these quasi-independent agencies ought not to stand against a presidential policy because he dislikes it . The question , for him , is whether the presidential line of policy is likely to frustrate the purpose of the agency upon which he serves , and no more ; he ought , even , to lean toward that line if it has serious pretensions to " reasonableness . " For administration becomes an impossible task if , within the confines of the executive power , agencies exist the end of which  | is , if possible , to strike into impotence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task is essentially a legislative one ; and , within the safeguards I have suggested , the larger the leeway that is given to the president the better . I do not doubt that this freedom may be abused or badly handled . But the correction of such errors is a task which devolves upon Congress . The answer to a bad administrative policy is , its legality apart , not a matter during the president 's term of office for officials of his government ; the answer is in the legislature which is elected for precisely that end . And if the legislature is incapable of performing that task of correction , it is a function which devolves upon the people . Any other policy than this destroys , I am confident , the foundations of effective government .  | THE president of the United States is elected by a j  --  method which now bears no relation to the purpose it is intended to fulfil . A majority in the electoral college may defeat a majority in the nation . It did so in 1876 and in 1888 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From any angle the electoral college is an anachronism , and the choice by states is undesirable . It has a real effect on the choice of candidates . Because , in all normal circumstances , the attitude of a particular state is known , the tendency is encouraged in parties not merely to select the candidate from a doubtful state , but also to stake " deals " before the election with the machines of l ) artictilar states , with a view to securing the noniination and the victory of a particular candidate . The Democratic party is confident that it will win the South ; and it has tended , therefore , since the Civil War , to take its presidential candidate from the Eastern seaboard and particularly from New York . The Northeast is predominantly Republican ; but the Republicans can win an election only by carrying all the states of the Middle West , and those on the border between the North and South . They have , therefore ,  | sought for candidates in the middle western states in order to achieve this alliance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turner , ' " consists not only in representing the special interests of the leader 's own section , but in finding a formula that will bring the different regions together in a common policy . " It is easy to show how much of American politics has been bedeviled , in the context of the presidency , by the search for this formula . Jefferson and Jackson owed their victories to their success iii finding it , as Clay and Calhoun owed their defeats to a failure in the same pursuit . The failure of Negro suffrage in the South has been the graveyard of Republican representation there ; and both in the emphasis of issues , and in the choice of candidates , it is the inherent implication of sectionalism to which fundamental attention must be paid . I think , therefore , that once it is agreed that the transcendence of sectionalism is desirable , it follows at once that the president should be elected by a direct national vote . That would have the wholly desirable effect of emphasizing his national position . It would prevent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; 2 and it would diminish , as it is urgent to diminish , the excessive regard that is paid to the claims of the machines of both parties in doubtful states . The real truth is that , at present , the state as a unit of electoral refer- footnote 1The Significance of Sections in American History ( 1932 ) , p. 50. 2 Cf. Pringle , op. cit. , pp. 561 f.  | ence is wholly parasitic upon the party structure . To exalt its importance , as the present method of election does , is to give an entirely undue prominence to the type of man to whom " politics " is a profession in the worst sense of the word . It would do a good deal to eliminate candidates whose claims ought never to be considered seriously ; and it would do something , at any rate , to save the remainder from commitments , both as to places and measures , they ought never to be asked to make . Two further simple reforms are worth suggesting . I can not see any case for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finance . He must now accept or reject congressional measures as a whole . That means , despite the reforms of the budget , that he is still at the mercy of the " pork barrel " system with all its evil implications . I should like to see Congress adopt the kind of self-denying ordinance that has worked so admirably in the House of Commons ; I would deny any member the right ? the power of investigation apart ? to ask for an appropriation that is not sought under the direct authority of the president . This would not merely result in more rational finance ; it would also prevent the Appropriations Bill from being the plaything of perhaps a hundred members of Congress , whether in the House of Representatives or in the Senate , whose sole interest in finance is the local achievement in construction they can report back to their constituencies . This is a power already conferred upon the governors of many states ,  | and , wherever it has been tried , there is no doubt that its effect has been beneficial . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-denying ordinance . Except upon purely selfish grounds , I can see no reason for the existence of " senatorial courtesy . " It is rarely invoked except for narrow reasons ; and , where it is invoked , its utilization is equally rarely defensible . Its effect is simply to narrow the area of presidential choice for ends intended not for the maintenance of a standard of appointment , but for the personal power of a particular senator . For reasons I have already urged , I think that the continuance of senatorial approval for the major nominations of the president is desirable ; this approval would still remain . But it is wholly unfitting that a judgeship or a collectorship of a port should be dependent , as it now is , upon the effect it may have upon the balance of internecine interests within a section of the party in power . No one can seriously argue that " senatorial courtesy " is exercised to the end that bad nominations should be rejected ; the wellknown cases of Roscoe Conkling and Gallinger are evidence of that . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use his nominating power as to assist men of the type of Ben Butler to build up a machine . It may be true that the power of individual senators would be adversely affected by this change . But it would not touch the collective power of the Senate . It would leave it free , in every case in modern times footnote 3 Cf. F. A. Cleveland and A. C. Buck , The Budget and Responsible Government ( 1920 ) , and L. Lipson , The American Governor ( 1939 ) .  | in which its approval might reasonably be regarded as a matter of doubt , to resolve its doubts by debate . On the record , it is impossible not to feel that the dignity of American public life would be definitely increased if the Senate could be persuaded to accept this view . " The fundamental addition which is necessary to enable the president to defy the pressure of local interests incarnate in senators and representatives , " writes Professor Brogan , ' " is the right to appeal to the nation by referendum . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutional amendments proposed by Congress , until the country has decided between them , and the right to propose his own amendments , and his own direct legislation to the country , whether or no Congress approves . If it is possible to make national politics out of sectional politics , it can only be done through the presidency . " I agree with the end Professor Brogan has in view ; I can not help feeling that his means are ill chosen . It is not merely that most of the issues upon which there is a division between executive and legislature do not seem to me susceptible of effective discussion by popular vote , and that this has been demonstrated by the history of the referendum in the various states ; 5 it is also that the experience of the United States suggests strongly that the referendum is an instrument any frequent use of which would place excessive power in the hands of the most undesirable influences footnote 4Government of the People ( 1933 ) , p. 382. 6 Cf. my Grammar of Politics ( ed. of 1938 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confident , moreover , that many of the issues so referred , that of the Tennessee Valley Authority , for example ? one of the half-dozen most beneficent experiments in American history ? would be defeated by exactly that sectionalism that Professor Brogan is anxious to transcend . I doubt , further , whether this right could be given to the president without its conference upon the people also ; and so to extend that right would almost certainly in many undesirable instances ? the control of public utilities is an obvious example ? be to play directly into the hands of the money power . The press and the radio would be at the disposal of every evil influence which had anything to lose . Who is there who can not see the kind of power such an occasion would give to men like Mr. William Randolph Hearst or Father Coughlin ? And who is there who can not sec , also , that the more indirect their influence over the voters of the United States , the healthier and cleaner its politics are likely to be ? The referendum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be of real use to any president who is seeking an effective refreshment of power ; and there is no reason to suppose that an appeal to its power on the national plane could ever be effectively canalized . A president might thus be easily deprived of an authority he could exert in one field because , by a narrow majority , and through purely extraneous causes , he has suffered an accidental defeat in another . I am sure that Professor Brogan is right in his insistence that the transcendence of sectionalism is the  | most urgent need in American politics ; and I think he is probably right in arguing that the president is the instrument through which that transcendence may be most properly effected . The stronger the president , on the whole , the more likely it is not only that the attention of Congress will be directed to matters of general importance ; but the more likely it is , also , that the mind of the nation will force Congress consistently to take that attitude . But to appreciate that problem we must , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that has made the Congress so deeply a sectional body . It is not , I suspect , enough to say that it is so because American parties are inherently sectional . That only pushes the inquiry back to the further stage of what forces have made them inherently sectional . The answer to this complicated problem goes deep into the roots of American life . For anyone who looks at the spectacle it presents will , I think , be struck at once by certain obvious things . It is , in the first lace , clear not only that there is no " liberal " party in the United States , at least in the European meaning of that term , but also that so far no revolt from either of the major parties has had any real staying power . There have been many of those revolts ; the Populist movement , the Progressive revolt under Roosevelt , the third-party movement under the elder La Follette , are only the most notable . But none of them has had importance on a plane of continuity . Sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Theodore Roosevelt , to the older parties from which they came , or have become politi-  | cally impotent . It is notable , also , that except for brief periods , and in particular states , American labor has played no such part on the political stage as it has in European countries . It is striking that , so far , socialism has taken no hold at all of the American voter 's mind ; the economic crisis has deepened continuously since 1933 , but the peak of socialist strength in the United States was reached in 1920 , and even then it was , in proportion to the strength of the major parties , pitiably small . These major parties represent , to a European , a curious spectacle . " Though there have been moments when their differences upon particular issues were substantial , since the Civil War the dividing line between them has never been real . Grover Cleveland , for instance , might well have been a Republican president ; and I can not see any essential item in the program of President Hayes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to commend . The truth is , I think , that these major parties have been essentially the agents of the property interests of the United States , that , in a general way , they have served them in much the same fashion , and that where they have diverged from service to them , it has been because of a profound popular agitation failure to respond to which would have meant electoral disaster . But up to , at any rate , the New Deal of 1933 , the character of the response has always been within a very limited frame of reference which did not seriously disturb the conservative character of either of the parties . Within the limits permitted them by the  | Supreme Court , they have been the legislative agents of business men and , to a less degree , the farming interests of the United States . The assumption upon which they have rested ? the assumption , indeed , upon which the New Deal itself rests ? is the social adequacy of American capitalism . They reflect its suspicion of government action . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be free from interference . Where they have been driven to interfere , it was usually either in a realm of minor importance or because crisis demanded a positive policy to which , at least immediately , they were compelled to give attention . Anyone who considers the history of American parties until 1933 will , foreign policy apart , find a notable resemblance between their character and that of British parties before the advent of the British Labour party in 1906 . They held a general social philosophy in common ; they diverged from it only to make concessions to particular pressure groups whose demands would not brook denial . But they did not go beyond a fairly narrow frame of reference pricked out for them by the dominant property interests as sound . In a sense. , indeed , they did not deserve the respect which the prewar parties in Great Britain were able to secure . Behind the congressional facade , both of them were unduly dominated by the great corporations and their representatives ; it is still true of American politics as Woodrow Wilson quotes Dale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the United States " a class , including thousands and  | tens of thousands of the best men in the country , who think it possible to enjoy the fruits of good government without working for them . ' Whether the issue was the tariff or the trusts , railroads or electric power , taxation or the place of labor in the community , the parties were , subject to occasional revolts , in the hands of that " invisible governinentt " of which F , lihu Root spoke ; a government of which the " USA 's " were , as Lincoln Steffens so reinarl ; ahly showed , more the symptom than the cause . ' ! ' he Brit ish aristocracy had , with all its limitations , a real sense of public service .

In this atmosphere , it is important ceaselessly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essentially a continent ; the making of unity out of its various sections was bound , therefore , under any circumstances , to be a difficult adventure . Second , because it was , until the nineties of the last century , a civilization in which expansion was always internal and not external , the creation of safeguards against discontent was a relatively easy matter . Opportunity , at least in comparison with Europe , was boundless ; there was abundance of land , there was no residuary feudalism , almost any taxes produced a surplus in the treasury . Few members of the working class expected to remain there ; most of them enjoyed conditions far footnote 8 Congressional Government ( 1885 ) , p. 331.  | higher than anything the European peasant or industrial worker has ever known . The triumphs of the business man were , on any showing , immense ; in three generations he had built a civilization out of a wilderness . Up to the Civil War , there might have been doubts and hesitations about the future of American civilization ; there were none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presidency of Grant onward , the United States seemed , to most , to have made a permanent bargain with fate . The less positive the action of government , the greater seemed to be the tempo of its development . Parties , therefore , adjusted themselves to an atmosphere in which weak government seemed the very condition of prosperity ; and , since the weaker the government the greater was the leeway given to the power of the propertied interests , the more jealously the latter scrutinized any movement toward regulation . The real governors of the United States , that is , wanted a weak system of rule . They were content with an atmosphere in which , as Woodrow Wilson said , " authority is perplexingly subdivided and distributed , and responsibility has to be hunted down in out-of-the-way corners . " ' Every attempt at its concentration seemed unsound to the beneficiaries of the system . It was " un-American " ; it was an attack upon freedom ; it was contrary to the purpose of the founders . And , in a fundamental sense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of authority in American history has only been possible at mo- footnote ' Op. cit. , p. 331.  | ments of crisis . It has been accepted dubiously , and after the crisis has passed it has been discarded as rapidly as possible . The American people , trained in the tradition of negative government , have always been suspicious of it . That suspicion has been shared by Congress since the more strong the personality of the man in the - VVliite I louse , the more diminished has the authority of Congress itself become . From the foundation of the American system , the inference has been drawn that the stronger the president , the graver was the threat to public freedom . ' File men of 1787 could hardly help remembering , as they looked at the England they knew , that a legislature which could be dominated by the executive was the enemy of public freedom . They desired , therefore , " to erect a Congress which would not be subservient and an executive which would not be despotic. ' ' f hey did so by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of governmental paralysis . " It was to have . been expected that they should regard an absolute separation of these two great branches of the system ( the executive and the legislature ) as the only effectual means for the accomplishment of that great end . " For something over a century they had every reason to believe that they were right . The system , on occasion , creaked and trembled ; but , upon balance , within that period it resulted in a triumphant progress it is impossible not to admire . It was only after a century ,  | when the epoch of abnormal expansion had begun to draw to its close , that analysis could suggest how real was the resemblance between the ends they had secured and the ends they had sought to avoid . For , having distributed authority , they found that , to cope with discontent , they had to bring it together again in order to prevent its paralysis . And the method by which the co-operation was secured bore a curious resemblance to the methods by which George III had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patronage by the president to obtain the majority he required was not very different from the use by George III of places and pensions to secure a majority in the House of Commons . The relation of the great interests to Congress has not been so unlike the domination of the eighteenth-century Parliaments to the interests of the great landowners . The truth of Lord Bute 's well-known maxim that " the forms of a free and the ends of an arbitrary government are things not altogether incompatible , ' " has been proved again and again in American history . And its truth has been emphasized by the way in which , from John Marshall onward , the Supreme Court has acted as a third chamber of the American legislature concerned to keep a possible co-operation between president and Congress within due bounds . The spectacle of the separation of powers is , this is to say , the spectacle of the confusion of powers . A president may seek to give a lead ; there is no one else in a position in which a clear lead can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ op. cit. , p. 308.  | he can not hope successfully to give a clear lead unless he is on one of two roads .

Then , at least , the prospect of a threat to the foundations of society leads to a co-operas ion in which he sets the direction .

The American scheme of government is , in its inherent principles , not only a system for fair weather . It is also a system which , as it has translated itself into party terms , does not easily accept the categories of the positive state . And this is the more important because America has now entered the epoch where the requirements of the positive state can no longer be denied . That can be seen from many angles . It is obvious , in the first place , because the dramatic period of internal expansion is over ; the problems confronted by American capitalism are similar in character and intensity to those of Europe . It is obvious , in the second , because tech-  | nological and scientific development have made largely obsolete the division of powers between the center and the circumference contemplated in 1787 ; in the epoch of giant capitalism only the federal government can hope to confront the great industrial empires on terms of equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third place , because the major parties have ceased to present the electorate with rational alternatives about any of the main problems to be solved . " That is the more emphatically the case because neither can admit within its ranks an organized labor movement seeking the translation of its needs into statutes on any wholesale scale . It is in fact evident that the labor problem in the United States is already ? without its effective entrance into politics ? forcing something like a realignment of parties there . Conservative Democrats and conservative Republicans find ? as their attitude to revision of the Wagner Act made evident13 ? far more in common upon the basis of hostility to the claims of labor than they do in antagonism upon other issues . And what is true of their attitude to the labor problem is true , also , of their outlook upon most of the problems which the social policy of the " New Deal " has been called upon to solve . The result can be put quite simply by saying that , emergency always apart , no president who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within footnote 11 Cf. my " Obsolescence of Federalism " in the New Republic , May 3 , 1939 ' - 12 See this well put in Brogan , op. cit. , p. 383. 13 On the Wagner Act cf. the admirable work of R.

Something of what he may want he will get in the " honeymoon period " of his office ; something , also , he may be able to extract by means of the patronage . But the more relentlessly he pursues major objectives that arc positive in character , the more certain he is to find himself thwarted by the inherent nature of the party of which he is the nominal and temporary leader . If he gains a temporary respite with a view to renomination for a second term , he is likely to find increasing opposit ion as that second term draws to its close . As he disappears from the scene , he is likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can more comfortably deal on its own terms ; it is not accident that a strong president has usually been followed by a succession of weak presidents , for they suit much better the environment to which both the American scheme of government and the American party system are historically conditioned . America needs strong government ; it needs strong leadership to attain strong government ; only the president , granted its characteristics , can provide it with the leadership it requires . But against these needs must be set all the traditional impetus of the system . The Constitution makes against it partly by its separation of powers and partly by the way in which it has distributed functions between the states and the federation . It has now become of pivotal interest to the forces of privilege in the United States to maintain for  | their benefit both that separation and that distribution ; and it must be remembered that , constitutional amendment apart , the degree to which that distribution can be effectively transcended lives precariously by the accidental composition of the Supreme Court . The Constitution makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , does the party system on its present foundation , since , except for emergencies , it enthrones the conservative forces in permanent power . These forces live by their ability to maintain weak government , for strong government , in the sense of a government with a continuously positive direction , is necessarily hostile to their interests . That can , I suggest , be seen from the intensity of their antagonism to the New Deal ; they have greeted a body of legislation in general as mild as that of the Liberal government of 1906 in England as though it were inaugurating an epoch of red revolution . Since weak government is the source from which these forces draw their power in the state , their impact upon parties is always s a discouragement to leadership in a positive form . And this discouragement can take many shapes . It tuav appear as sectionalism . It may appear through the frustration of the executive by an encouragement of opposition to its policies in the legislature . It may appear as the exploitation of the traditional American fear of strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public lends a more ready ear than to that of dictatorship , and that even when the very foundations of the system paralyze , almost a priori , any prospect of its constitutional advent .  | I do not , therefore , believe that the strong leadership America requires will be available to it until the conflict between parties is on a rational basis ; and I believe that this will require a radical realignment of parties . For where the choice between policies that has to be made is real , effective party discipline will follow the fact of the reality of the choice ; and a president who is anxious to lead his party will then find that he has a party anxious to follow his lead . The problem , in fact , at least as l see it , is the adjustment of American parties to the disposition of social forces in the United States . At present , there is no such adjustment . Leadership on a big scale conics only because an emergency has to be surmounted . There is no provision for its continuity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system is against its continuity . For once it becomes continuous , all the interests are weakened which suffer from its strength . A great president is bound to weaken them by the fact that he is great . I do not think it is true to say that he dwarfs his followers in Congress by the fact that he gives a lead . I do say that , by giving it , he makes Congress a unity behind him , for purposes he defines , instead of an incoherent mass of unco-ordinated elements which find their unity in the degree that they can alter those purposes . In the present scheme , the more Congress is able to defeat the president , the bigger it appears in the life of the nation . It is thus given a vested interest in his defeat . It is tempted to it by its inevitable and natural inclination to exalt its own stature . The Senator Robinson who carries out the will of the presi-  | dent will never appear so big a man in the eyes of the nation as the Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present position , only human for most of those who go to Congress to have the ambition to be a Senator Borah rather than a Senator Robinson . But a legislature is not of itself capable of positive leadership unless it is organized for this function . The British system organizes the House of Commons for this end by making it accept or reject , at the peril of a general election , the policies submitted to it by the cabinet . It does not lead the cabinet . It is not a policymaking body . It is an organ of registration , an instrument of criticism , a sounding board through which the voice of the nation can make itself heard . No provision is made for this relation in the American scheme . The president may urge his policies ; he has no adequate sanctions to enforce them . And , once they are urged , he has no real certainty about what may become of them . There is no effective responsibility anywhere for their fate . An influential member of the legislature is , if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way as the president ; there are even spheres i-I which he is more likely to have his way . Congressional organization builds an executive within the legislature that is not truly charged with the executive function . Partly , it has the function of destroying the policy of the real executive ; partly , it has the function of providing an alternative to it , which is rarely a part of any coherent pattern of policy . And the composition of this executive within the legislature is continually changing . It is one set of men on one set of  | problems ; it is another set of men upon another . Whatever set of men it may be , one of their concerns must always be to establish and to emphasize their independence of the true executive power . But to establish that independence they must prevent his leadership from possessing that continuity of which I have spoken . They must , therefore , be a rampart against strong leadership . They must be a force to deny , not a force to co-operate in affirming . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must always be to make the presidency as weak as it- possibly can . This is not , I think , a situation that can be remedied by mechanical devices . I have already sought to show that it would not be cured by the introduction of a presidential right to a referendum . Nor do 1 believe , as has been suggested , that it can be cured by giving to the president a right to dissolve the Congress when they are at odds and seek , thereby , a refreshment of authority from the electorate . The implications of the right of dissolution are incompatible with the congressional system . They strike at the root of the separation of powers . The defeat of the president , at an election caused by its exercise , would obviously come very near to paralyzing his effectiveness during the remainder of his term ; it is , indeed , doubtful whether , after such a defeat , he could usefully remain in office . And this is to say , I think , that the counterpart of a presidential right of dissolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring into being . If he were conceded that power , it would  | not be possible to avoid a rapid development of the parliamentary system , in something like the British form , in the United States . The presidential system , in its historic contours , could hardly survive the conference upon him of so tremendous a power without the exaction of a comparable responsibility . I believe , therefore , that the changes required in the United States are likely to be produced less by direct constitutional innovation than by the repercussion upon the political framework of the immense social and economic changes that are going on before our eyes . This is not to say that I do not believe those constitutional innovations to be desirable . On the contrary , the case made , over seventy years ago , by Bagehot against the ultimate principles of the presidential system seems to me to have been strengthened , rather than weakened , by time.14 But I doubt whether anything short of actual revolution would cause direct changes of the kind necessary to be made . The power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be mobilized against them are too strong . One has only to consider the relative failure of most efforts at direct innovation in the separate states , whenever the basis of the Constitution has there been called into question , to see how incomparably more difficult it would be to deal directly with the heart of the federal scheme . Revolution apart , it is to the pressure of usage and habit , as these are shaped by innovation within the economic fabric of the United States , that one must look for the main sources of change . footnote 14 Cf. my essay in The Dangers of Obedience ( ' 930 ) , pp. 31 f.  | These innovations arc on an immense scale ; and they are likely to increase rather than to decrease in volume .

All this is bound , I believe , to niakc the ambit of federal regulation in the future wider than it has been in the past . The state will be forced into an attitude far more emphatically positive than anything for which , so far , the " New Deal " has been responsible . There will be exacted , if American democracy endures , a much higher price for the maintenance of privilege than any it has so far been asked to pay . It is worth while to insist , for a moment , upon the fact that there is nothing new or startling in this development . The critics of the " New Deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of revolutionary intensity .
