Nothing that the war had done to England was so important . Last week , with no more warning than a gliding buzz-bomb , the Conservative Government launched its " prosperity and happiness program , " Lord Woolton 's plan for cradle-to-grave social security . Famed Sir William Beveridge , stepfather of the plan , gave it his blessing , even thought it an improvement on his own . To most people it looked like " socialism in our time . " <P> The plan had come with that inevitability of gradualness which is woven into British history . It had taken five years of war to speed up an unhurried trend toward socialism . ( Characteristically , it was the Tories who achieved it . ) Once more Britain had quietly evolved a major change in its national life because enough Britons wanted it . <P> This time there was an added incentive : the Empire wanted it too . Already two Dominions-New Zealand and South Africa-were tackling social-security problems . In London a conference of Dominion Labor Parties resolved : " The conference looks forward to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> War on Poverty . Amiable , efficient Lord Woolton , Britain 's Conservative Reconstruction Minister , called the plan " a declaration of war against poverty . " Based on the Beveridge Plan , but costing slightly less ( approximately $2,600,000,000 for the first year against the Beveridge Plan 's $2,788,000,000 , it is the product of several ministries , many minds . It is all-embracing ( it provides for every man , woman &; child ) , and cooperative ( it is financed by compulsory contributions from all who are able to pay ) . Its benefits begin at birth with a maternity allowance , end at death with a grant . General benefits cover sickness , invalidism , unemployment , retirement , widows ' pensions , orphans ' allowances , industrial injuries , family allowances , maternity and death grants . <P> Sample benefits : maternity grants , 4 ( $16 ) plus benefits of 1 16s ( $7.20 ) weekly ; unemployment and sickness pay , 2 ( $8 ) weekly for a married couple , 1 45 ( $4.80 ) for a single person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things in kind " - school meals , milk-for each child after the first ; widows ' pensions , 1 16s ( $7.20 ) weekly for the first 13 weeks ; orphans ' allowances , 125 ( $2.40 ) weekly . <P> To pay for all this , the average worker will have to contribute about 43 ( 80 ) a week , his employer slightly less . Taxation will make up the balance . Not until 1975 will the plan become selfsupporting . <P> The plan will mean much more government in Britain . Before it becomes law-probably not before next summer , perhaps not before a general election-a Ministry of Social Insurance will have to be created . <P> Wonderful , Epoch-Making . Britons were delighted . The press greeted the plan with a roar of approval , pushed the war off the front pages to make room for it . The Times hailed it as " an epoch-making document , " the Daily Express as " a wonderful scheme .
