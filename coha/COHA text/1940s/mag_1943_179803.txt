U.S. merchant shipbuilders had good reason to feel proud last week-they were the one U.S. industry to reach the 1942 production goals set up by President Roosevelt right after Pearl Harbor . Aircraft production fell short by 12,000 planes or 20% . Tank and anti-aircraft gun programs were both revised by Washington and neither reached the original goals . But the shipbuilders splashed through with 746 ships totaling 8,090,800 tons , 90,800 tons over the President 's quota . <P> For this record U.S. shipbuilders can thank a terrific last-month production drive , plus plenty of ingenuity and management-labor cooperation throughout the year . In December alone U.S. shipyards shattered all world records by delivering 1,999,300 tons of sturdy ships , almost double production in all 1941 and 36% of the peak year in World War I. <P> This is good but shipbuilders must do still better ; the 1943 merchant ship goal is a 100% boost to 16,000,000 tons-less than the rate of production in hectic December but almost equal to Britain 's entire merchant marine at War 's beginning . Even so , most shipbuilders are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The means : 1 ) more prefabrication , 2 ) perfection of the assembly-line technique , 3 ) more welding and less riveting , 4 ) increased standardization of parts , gears and fittings . The chief danger now is shortage of materials .
