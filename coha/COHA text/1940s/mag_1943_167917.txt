Housewives hurried from store to store , hunting butter . Sometimes they got a quarter pound for Christmas . Oftener they got the grocer 's excuse : deliveries from his wholesaler had been cut a fourth or a half , and his small stocks had long ago been sold. * <P> Thus the housewives got an inkling of a bitter truth : they were face to face with the most serious butter shortage in the history of a country that once overflowed with milk . The huge stocks of butter in storage were almost gone , and just beginning was winter , when butter production normally sinks to the lowest levels of the year . <P> Of some of the reasons for the butter famine the homemakers were generally aware : labor shortages on farms ( TIME , Nov. 23 ) , transportation difficulties , mix-ups in the entire milk economy . The same thing had been true of sugar , meat , coffee , cheese ; the same would be true , they could be sure , of a coming succession of canned , frozen and processed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> But most important reason is bigger consumption : the Army &; Navy are now eating some 200 million lb. a year-and will need more as the armed forces grow . Huge amounts of butter are being delivered for Lend-Lease-a total of 8.5 million lb. between April 1941 and October 1942 , of which 5 million lb. were shipped in October alone . And U.S. civilian demand , said the Agriculture Department , could go up to 2,600 million lb. ( from 2,300 million in 1941 ) under current ceiling prices because of the nation 's increased buying power . <P> But in the face of these unusual demands , the estimated U.S. production for the year ending July 1943 is only 2,100 million lb. - 130 million lb. below the 1940-41 production . Hence , to equalize supplies , the Agriculture Department last week forecast direct consumer rationing of butter . Likely level : 17.5 lb. per person a year , compared to the 20.5 lb. the average citizen would like to get . <P> <P> *In Detroit , housewives bought butter at $1.25 a lb. from farmers exempt from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of produce the previous month .
