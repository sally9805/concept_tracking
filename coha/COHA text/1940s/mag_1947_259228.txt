He was born in Naples and brought up in Brooklyn . He was hot-tempered , dramatic , sentimental and tough ; a hairy , meaty youth with cold eyes and a brawler 's arms . An ugly scar disfigured his left cheek-the mark of a fiery little Sicilian who was the first and last man ever to cut him with a knife . He fought with either his fists or a pistol . By the time he was 19 , he was skilled in robbery , and was suspected of two murders . <P> Then he moved to Chicago . In Prohibition days , Chicago was easy pickings for a smart kid from Brooklyn . <P> He went to work for Johnny Torrio , a First Ward vice and bootleg racketeer , running a saloon and brothel ( at $75 a week ) on South Wabash Avenue . He did his work well . Soon he became Torrio 's field general and drill sergeant , and was cut in on a $100,000-a-year profit . Chicago began to hear the newcomer 's name . It was Al Capone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south and west across Chicago and into the saloons , gambling joints and dance halls of suburban Burnham , Stickney and Cicero . He built his own army . By 1924 he commanded 700 men , was making $100,000 a week and lusting for more . But Dion O'Banion , a murderous Irishman with a sweet smile and a passion for flowers , stood in his way . <P> Chicago had a war . It was a commercial war , waged with Tommy guns , grenades , sawed-off shotguns , pistols , and speeding automobiles . Its soldiers wore a unique uniform-black velvet-collared topcoat and pearl-grey hat . It was a war which enriched the language , inspired a dozen books , plays and motion pictures , and damned the Volstead Act . <P> <P> It was Big Al 's war . O'Banion was rubbed out . His mob half-killed Johnny Torrio with shotgun slugs , broke his nerve and drove him out of town . For a while , the O'Banions were as tough as Al 's mob . Its leaders were hard and ambitious-George ( " Bugs " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Earl ( Hymie ) Weiss , the rosary-fingering inventor of the one-way ride . One day seven automobile loads of O'Banion men parked in front of Al 's GHQ in Cicero and riddled it with Tommy guns . Al escaped . The O'Banions were not really broken until 1929 . That was the year that five Capone gunmen , three dressed like harmless policemen , carried out the St. Valentine 's Day Massacre , leaving seven men dead in a North Side garage . It was the Austerlitz of gang killings . <P> Capone never paused in his drive for power . He bought politicians wholesale and had complete immunity from the law-from 1923 to 1926 Chicago had 135 gang killings , six arrests , one conviction , no executions . He gained control of gambling , prostitution , dance halls , dog tracks and roadhouses as well as the enormous beer and liquor business . The U.S. called him Public Enemy No. 1 .
