When a team of U.S. and Mexican inspectors , vaccinating Mexican cattle against aftosa ( foot &; mouth disease ) , set out for the mountain country northwest of Mexico City , it was warned of possible trouble . A scout reported that villagers and farmers in the area were being told by the deeply Catholic , anti-government Sinarquistas : " He who cooperates with the anti-aftosa commission is a traitor . Do not cooperate . The anti-aftosa is a . Russian Communist plot to destroy your cattle . " <P> Stocky , brown-haired Robert Proctor , the 23-year-old team leader , was not the sort to walk away from trouble . Handy with his fists , fluent in Texmex Spanish , * he had been one of the most promising rodeo riders around Tucson , Ariz , before he went south to help stamp out aftosa . He had handled plenty of tough situations ; he figured he could handle this one too . <P> Just after noon one day last week , Roberto , as his teammates called him , rode his horse up the steep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ del Alto . Ten yards behind followed his Mexican assistant , Raul Sanchez . About 40 yards farther back rode three soldiers ( the only armed men in the party ) and a guide . Topping the rise , Roberto rode slowly up to the church on the sunbaked , cactus-hedged plaza . As he was about to dismount , he suddenly cried to Sanchez : " Get out quick , go back . " <P> From behind church and cactus rushed 600 screaming men &; women armed with clubs and stones . They surrounded the riders , grabbed the soldiers ' rifles . Sanchez was beaten into unconsciousness ; Proctor fought his way out and dashed towards a wooded area with a mob at his heels . The soldiers escaped to give the alarm . <P> Three hours later , Sanchez was carried into Toluca hospital . Government police fanned out over the hills looking for Proctor . Only after getting tough with the farmers were they led to a mountain grave . There they found the battered body of Roberto Proctor . He was the ninth official ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexican farmers fearful that anti-aftosa teams came to do them harm instead of good . <P> *The half English , half Spanish patois of the U.S.-Mexican border region .
