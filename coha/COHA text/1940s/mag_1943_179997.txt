At 1943 's beginning Pierre Laval promised 250,000 French workers to Germany . Reich Manpower Commissioner Fritz Sauckel demanded more . Laval 's police and German troopers have raided factories , cafes , theaters and other places for able-bodied men , then herded them into freight cars for shipment abroad . Last week Laval took the most extreme step yet : he drafted 21-year-old Frenchmen working on Nazi fortifications in France for jobs inside Germany . <P> The motive was plain : able-bodied Frenchmen in the Reich ( 1,250,000 war prisoners plus 1,150,000 Nazi-drafted laborers ) will not only toil for the New Order but they will be less likely to join the Allied army of liberation when the day of deliverance comes .
