THE PILGRIM HAWK A NOVEL IN TWO PARTS  --  PART TWO BY GLENWAY WESCOTT SyrroPsts OF PART I. In 1929 at Chancellet in France Alwyn Tower , who tells the story , is staying with his friend , an American girl named Alexandra Henry . The Cullen , an Irish couple , come for the afternoon . Madeleine Cullen bears on her wrist a falcon called Lucy ; and all afternoon she talks of falconry with passionate interest . Larry Cullen hates Lucy . Alwyn Tower hears of Mrs. Cullen 's extreme devotion to her husband , and of his drinking and his jealousy . Alexandra 's Italian manservant , Jean , and her maid , Eva , are great cooks ; and she asks the Culiens to stay for dinner . Their chauffeur , Ricketts , goes with Jean to buy squab ; and Mrs. Cullen feeds one to Lucy . Then she and Alexandra retire briefly , leaving Cullen and Tower together . I OFFERED Cullen a cocktail . He rose with enthusiasm and followed me to what I called the choir loft , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit to install a bar , in the fashion of the twenties : all chromium and copper with a fine hierarchy of glasses and remarkable liquors in odd bottles . My Irishman had never seen the like of it . There was a magnum of prc-war vodka ; and I suggested a kind of modified Alexander with that in it instead of gin . Missing a syllable , he thought it charming of me , and so American , to serve a drink named after our hostess . I tried to set him right on that point but he was too charmed to care . The drink itself also suited him and for a while he concentrated on it , without a word , The ladies did not return , so presently I mixed a second shakerful ; and Alex 's silver shaker was large . It was indiscreet , perhaps a little perverse , and in a way characteristic of me . As a rule I dislike being with people who have had too much to drink . It often brings on in me a kind of misanthropic fit : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they sometimes notice . But just because I am aware ofthe old-maidishness and even injustice of this , whenever the hospitality of the bottle is up to me I am inclined to overdo it . Cullen , in fact , had been a little tight all afternoon , and I had not realized it . Now as he got tighter I saw that it was the same thing . They had arrived at Chancellet about two-thirty ; so probably it had happened at luncheon , perhaps at breakfast . That explained his wife 's anxious and resentful air , and her rude motherly snubs to keep him in order . He must have been in misery the last few hours , while we failed to offer him anything thoughtlessness on my part , per-haps prudence or dislike on Alex 's . She of course knew him well and must have noticed . Perhaps the unnoticeable sort of heavy daytime drinker has the worst trouble ; certainly they are more troublesome to others than they think . And otherssobersides like myself  --  are often more unjust to them than to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they themselves are only half aware of any incapacity or lack of charm . Or perhaps they know , and they think that you do not , and you do , and of course it is not manners to tell them so . They make an effort , often a heroic effort ; and you feel that you have to respect and applaud that , whether or not it is fun for you . But the worst injustice must he when you scarcely know them and you judge them without reference to their habit , as in my case with Cullen that afternoon . He had simply seemed to me mediocre , old for his age , and weak for his size , dull , vain , and rather cross . No one had warned me that I was not seeing him at his best . It was his character , for all I knew , the nature of the creature  --  take it or leave it . That is to say , I had left it . So now I felt a slight embarrassment and grudging contrition . Perhaps at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal , his mind vigorous , his great physique fresh and energetic . That would explain the love his wife bore him . Suppose you have learned to like or to love such a man when he was sober , and you happen to dislike him when he is not , and he does n't know the difference or ca n't help it . The temptation to interfere , the fond hope of reformation , must be very great . Thus I began to think indulgently of Mrs. Cullen 's selfish nervousness and sharp tongue . Although , if what I had seen that afternoon was the worst of it , certainly she exaggerated and overemphasized the plight she was in with him . An ordinary boring , conceited , uneasy , childish man ! Yet out of his petty instability she seemed to expect something odious or dangerous to develop any minute  --  as if she felt the ground underfoot move a bit , like a landslide starting , and caught glimpses of little creeping sickening things close to the surface , coming up I Love itself is an exaggeration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first pouring of the second round suddenly Cullen began a long complaint of the merry chase she led him year in and year out : her Mediterranean cruises , her falcons , her Irish republicans . No home to speak of , no creature corn-forts ; nothing like the good time Alex and I had here in Chancellet , this pretty bar for example . Nothing but wild men , wild birds , and two silly maids to mop up after the birds instead of a good cook ; hotel food all the year round , never a Ieg of boar soaked in brandy nor squab with currants . At first , I think his outburst embarrassed him as well as me . For he explained that if I were an Englishman he would not be talking to me in this way ; nor , for that matter , if he were an Englishman ! But the Irish are like Americans in this respect . He had been in the States three or four years when he was a young fellow ; therefore he felt the likeness . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 're sly ; they simply rule and have their own way about everything . Britannia rules the waves and so on . You know , Tower , my wife 's English . . . . " These little distinctions of nationality were what reminded him of their winter in London with the Irish republicans . He not only disliked that type of Irish ; their political principles seemed suspect to him . " They 're not really republicans , that 's just talk . They 're anarchists . It was beastly for me . I 'm a fool , I 'd do anything in the world for my wife , and she does whatever strikes her fancy . She kept asking those patriots to the house . It cost me a pretty penny too , I can tell you . I had to pay for a lot of pamphlets , I had to support two widows , I had to hire halls for their meetings . Then , if you please , some of ' em said they needed some guns and bombs . Can you believe it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing happened . It would serve the English right if they did blow things up , you know . I suppose my wife 's little friends just pocketed the money , or they bought a poor make of bomb that would n't do . Nothing happened . " He also complained that they were comic little characters , not gentlemen . And all their women appeared half-crazed with loving them , weeping in the corridor , losing their tempers with each other : some of them occult , some religious , and all of course talking Ireland , Ireland . Not a class of women that a man of a sensual nature would look twice at , not if he had any self-respect ; nothing soft or sweet or tidy about them . " But I must say I enjoyed it for a while , " he admitted , " seeing how that class of people get on and hearing their stories . I could always shut them up when I felt like it , or chuck them all altogether , you understand , because I had the money . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but still his monologue amused me , especially the vulgar touches like this last . No doubt he was a quite good county aristocrat of that modest rank which as a rule is less mixed than any other . But not even aristocracy can be expected to give good examples of itself all the time . It seems rather to secrete commonness little by little , and to keep it in reserve , along with those odds and ends of mere human nature which aristocratic manners are intended to hide . And every generation or two it purges itself , in the form of some odd son or daughter , perfect little shopkeeper or predestined courtesan , upon whom manners wear thin . Cullen silently ruminated two or three minutes ; and when he began again it was in the middle of a new bit of subject matter . Probably it seemed to him that he had told me something which he had been saying to himself , something about his wife . " Make no mistake , Tower , I respect my wife . " And he went on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who doubted it or slighted her in the least was quite likely to be knocked down by him ; in fact he had done it once . She was like a swan in his opinion ; pure as snow , with never a harmful thought all her life . " Only she 's thoughtless , " he added . " She never thinks of anything except what she happens to want . She 's spoiled . When I met her she was the prettiest girl in Dublin . Lovely breasts for one thing . And ankles  --  you saw her ankles ! Her family was n't well offeither ; I took her without a penny and I 've spoiled her . " Aristocracy had nothing to do with it . It was my own fault ; the vodka and cream had done it . Alcohol is the great leveler . Given a stiff drink , the true descendant of princes boasts of it as if it were not true , the multimillionaire feels poor , and Tristan talks to you about lsolde like a pimp , I said to myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's folly . " I spoiled her myself , " he continued . " That 's why she 's so restless . Damn it , Tower , for years now she 's kept me on the go like a gypsy . We 've done everything . " He held up one large moist freckled hand and counted on its unsteady fingers the things they had done : salmon fishing and photography and pig-sticking and now hawking . They had also been everywhere , and he counted places too , with a boastful as well as pathetic intonation : Norway and America and Java and Morocco and Africa  --  to say nothing of that winter when she had insisted on Irish rebellion , the most expensive thing on earth . " I 've let her have all my money , " he said proudly . " She is n't as pretty as she was ; but you know , I let her go to London for all her dresses or Paris ; and she has two maids . Before I married her T had a man to look after me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ricketts , because we 're always on the go . I have to keep an cyc on him too , because he has an eye for a pretty woman . Funny thing , one day when we were shooting in Scotland with those Americans , I thought he  --  Ricketts  --  was insolent about Mrs. Cullen , and I 'd have killed him . But she said I imagined it . " Alcoholism in a nutshell , I foolishly mused ; and while he , poor man , counted his sports and his travels on his fingers I meanly ticked off the drunkard 's faults and pitfalls of drink as it were on my fingers  --  indiscretion and boastfulness and snobbism ; and sentimentality so nervous that it may switch any minute to the exact opposite ; and the sexual note and the sadistic note , undesirable desire , improbable murder . All of it of course a bit unreal and unrealizable in fact . . . . And what exaggeration I had drifted into ! Cullen really was not in very bad shape ; I have spent afternoons with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time , item by item as he talked along ; and I think he sensed it and played up to it : a fatalist and a play-actor . The presence of my fastidious Alex and his overwrought wife downstairs  --  my wishing they would hurry up and join us , and my dreading it at the same time  --  made his loose talk more exciting than it would have been in ordinary circumstances . I had been too happy all afternoon , thinking meanwhile of unhappiness ; which is a heady combination . Sometimes I am as sensitive as a woman to others ' temper or temperament ; and it is a kind of sensitivity which may turn , almost by chance , for them or against them . Perhaps at the end of our tete-N-tete I was not much soberer than my companion . I began to wonder whether , after all , he was not going to tell me the little tale of anxiety or jealousy that winter in London which Alex had half told me in the park . And then he did . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began , " had the insolence to fall in love with my wife . A brute of a young fellow named McVoy who was a poet . It got very sticky then . I made up my mind to show them the door , the lot of them . But the more I worried about it , the easier it was for my wife to get round me and have her own way . I did n't want to be unjust to her ; and if I 'd made a scene before I knew what was up , you see , I might never have known . Terrible , the power a woman has over a man of my nature . You see that side of it , do n't you ? " He told it tranquilly enough , though with some breathing between words . He reached out and grasped the cocktail shaker ; and having helped himself , kept a tight hold on it . Once or twice he slipped off the tall stool and took stepsup and down , carrying the shaker with him instead of his glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refill . I had not poured any of this second shakerful for myself ; it was almost empty . The whites of his eyes grew more and more untidy , the hazel pupils a harder color ; sense of humor and self-knowledge dying down in them . The strong though puffy fingers fixed on the large silver vessel , melting the frostiness off it in patches . I thought of wresting it away from him , emptying it slyly down the little chromium sink ; perhaps pretending to be getting drunk myself , and jollying and bullying him along downstairs . . . . Naturally I did nothing ; I looked and listened , I nodded . I wiped the copper top of the bar more than it needed , like a bartender . Probably even bartenders feel a little ignominious curiosity amid their professional boredom . . . . " One fine day there had to be an end of it , McVoy and all that . Especially one night . The police misunderstood something about him , and were waiting for him at his lodgings ; so we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't sleep a wink . I kept hearing him sneaking around in the dark after my wife , thought . All imagination ; I 've too much imagination anyway . My wife and I shared a bedroom  --  we always do ? and he 'd never have had the courage to come in there . " Then I had a disgusting dream . I woke up standing beside my wife 's bed . There was a moon , and I could see her and she was sleeping . But I could n't sleep . So about three o'clock / got up and took a knife from the butler 's pantry . I thought I 'd tackle McVoy with it . But my wife woke up and came and followed me , across the hall . When she saw the knife naturally it frightened her terribly . And the funny thing was , she frightened me too , there on the landing in her white nightgown . She made me give her the knife and go back to our bedroom . The wonder is we did n't wake McVoy . If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect . But he slept through it all . Or perhaps he was listening and hiding , scared , under his bed . " After that I think my wife saw my point of view about it , and was sorry for me . She wept , and it was n't like her to weep . In a way I was sorry for her too . Think of it , Tower ! Think of a common little fellow like that coming to your house , whinnying like a horse around a respectable married woman . He 'd have had only himself to blame if I had knifed him . After that Mrs. Cullen sent them all packing , believe me . All the rebels . " He picked up the shaker and shook it hopefully . Now there was only the clunk of small ice in diluted cream , to which I was deaf : a poor host at last , now that it was too late . My feeling about it all really was an absurd mixture . I felt a certain compassion ; all the world loves a lover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh aloud and to tease him . I also itched to tell him the miserable truth about himself , and rather vengefully than for the good it might do . There are a number of circumstances in which the truth does no good ; oh , this was one . I began to feel a mixture of sadness with my malice --  -- a fellow-feeling in spite of myself . Drunkenness does superimpose a certain peculiarity and opaqueness of its own  --  monotonous complexion , odd aroma , pitch of voice , and nervous twitch ? on the rest of a man 's humanity ; over the personality that you have known sober . But worse still is the transparency and the revelation , as it were sudden little windows uncurtained , or little holes cut , into common recesses of character . It is an anatomy lesson : behold the ducts and sinuses and bladders of the soul , common to every soul ever born ! Drunken tricks are nothing but basic human traits . Ordinary frame of mind is never altogether unlike this babble of morbid Irishman . I felt the sickish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me that only art has the right to make one feel that . I am inclined to detest anyone who makes me feel it , as you might say , socially . " God , Tower , it 's tragic , " my man sighed . " There 's always something . Now I have to keep an eye on our damned Ricketts . " He kept it on me for a while then , flashing it or rolling it ; sometimes as simply as Othello , sometimes with the imagination and abstraction of a eunuch . " You know , Tower , it 's very interesting . My wife and I are the ideal married couple , so to speak . It 's real love . Shc would n't look at another man . I 'm as good a man as ever in spite of my age ; it runs in the family , and I understand women . Oh , it 's not all roses ; it never was all roses . There were times when I thought I 'd leave her , after some of the mistreatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , and she might learn to treat me better . All it would need to summon her back would be a wink and a beckoning . She 'd do it ; she 'd stoop her proud neck , I tell you ; she 'd come on her hands and knees . But I 'd never humiliate her , Tower ; I never have . To me she 's still the proud ignorant girl as I married her , the prettiest in all Dublin . " The worst mistreatment I 've had to bear , you know , is this hawk . There are things only a common fellow could bear peaceably , and a hawk is one of ' em . Funny about hawks , you know , they ca n't learn to control themselves . They make their messes when they feel the need . Oh , well , you saw it with your own eyes ; I sympathized with you . It happens in the hotel , the maids mop up after it , and I ca n't tell you how ashamed I am . I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might make a joke of it . Madeleine has to tell him what we want ; I wo n't go near him . . . . Funny about women , is n't it ? They have n't the same natural shame about things that men have . Let 's face it that 's why the church has to keep them in their place , they ca n't help it . I suppose if they had finer feelings , we men would get left out in the cold , would n't we ? They 'd have none of our kisses . So there you are . " My wife 's a fine trainer of hawks ; her crooked old Hungarian admits it him-self . But that is one way she ca n't subdue ' em ; it 's their nature . She ca n't teach me much either . She 's got to get rid of that hawk , pretty quick ; I wo n't stand for it . You see , I love her , Tower ; that 's the trouble . Suppose I want to put my arm around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Can I ? No , Larry , no , dear , you 'll break a feather , a very important flight feather ! Day after day now on the way to Hungary I 'll have to sit there pushed over in the corner of the back seat out of Lucy 's way ; and I tell you , it makes me sick . " She 's been keeping it in our bedroom , because it does n't like the bathroom . She 's sorry for it . I lie awake all night hearing it stir on the perch , and I never forget it for a minute . When I 'm beginning to fall asleep I think it 's coming to attack me with its nasty beak . You ca n't imagine what it means to me . I dream of it . I dream sometimes it 's an obscene thing ; and that wakes me and I reach my arm over to my wife 's bed ; but she 's asleep and takes no notice of me . I tell you , it 's not healthy . I dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old uncle who saw ghosts , in a big house we had in Galway . I inherited that kind of feeling , you see , and Lucy brings it on . I 'll tell you another dream . When I was a boy my old nurse taught me to weave osier baskets ; and the other night I dreamed Lucy was a basket . Her feathers were n't right for it because they were sticky , but I wove her ; and I gave her to my wife . But this is the end ! No more Lucy ! " That was a lovely moment , to my way of thinking . My animosity toward this fool husband suddenly wafted away . It is a manner of self-revelation that I especially delight in : by means of loose imagery and dreams and careless connection of odd bits of memory as they come . Even as he spoke I hoped that I should be able to remember every word . For alcohol is a god , as the Greeks decided when it was first introduced from the East , although a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everyone is to blame . The soberest man or woman in the world at some time or another has helped the sad process along in some poor dear drinker 's case . For example , I think someone must have looked at Cullen in his youth when drunkenness became him , and so loved or admired him in it , that he began to regard that as the secret of love and admiration . There are men who master the trick of drink , and practically never take a drop without being made admirable by it . I have known one or two ; they were extraordinary men in other ways as well . But even for the average man , even in the poorest booze-fight  --  between the vanity of the beginning and the sickness at last  --  there is a fine moment . It is the mark of its Oriental origin and the proof of the Greek belief in it . The fumes seem suddenly mixed with more light and air than usual , and it is the right mixture . The silly self-consciousness clears up ; the chip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you are not or not much ; so naturally there is an undercurrent of quarrel between you ; now suddenly it ceases , peaceful . His tipsy mind is as it were sitting quiet , like an oracle on a tripod , under the influence not of alcohol simply , but of himself , his very nature , his fatality , his childhood . Whatever has been kept secret , damped in ashes , smothered and contemptible , begins to come out ; and for the average man there is no harm in it . The murderous man may murder then , the madman talk nonsense ; who cares ? For most of us the ashes are bad , the secrecy mistaken , the contempt and self-contempt contemptible  --  and the raking of the ashes is good . For a moment , drunk as a lord , instead of coarseness and looseness you have the intuition of a child or an old woman . . ? Of course it does not last long . Ordinarily when it has occurred , befuddlement and some bodily incompetence are in the offing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worst corn-pany in the world all one 's life . But certainly it is one of the main things in human nature , worth experiencing and worth watching . Cullen did not quite reach it that afternoon on vodka and cream in Alex 's silly de luxe bar . But I thought he was about to when we were interrupted . As I really did not like him anyway I did not care much . It was Alex who interrupted us , coming into the big room under the balcony and calling to me . She wanted me to visit Jean and Eva in the kitchen , and encourage them about the impromptu dinner and hurry them up . She had been hearing strange tones of voice out there ; and she was afraid that if she went herself Jean might make speeches and Eva might weep . It was a large , unmistakably French kitchen : the stove in a deep niche of brick ; dim walls and array of copper ; the open doorway and windows full of little landscape , with afternoon sunlight slanting across it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and somehow it seemed to inc dramatic as well as picturesque . Jean was the classic manservant , a type that you find more or less the same all round the Mediterranean : doubtless very good-looking and amorous as a boy ; forty now and the worse for wear , with a bald spot and dark jowls and several teeth missing ; a man broken to harness but still apt to show off his emotions , and still amorous . He had acquired Eva in Morocco , and she certainly had Moorish blood although she called herself Italian . She was half his age and lovely , although of an increasing billowy fatness ; pale in the way that seems sallow at times , silvery at other times . Ricketts was a fine cockney , bright-eyed and sharp-nosed . He sat at the table in the middle of the room in a spoiled young male attitude , with a bottle of wine half empty and half a plate of Eva 's little Moorish cakes . Dinner was flourishing ; that I could tell by the smell of it . Along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tart exhalation of the sod , a scent of some shrub that was like a dark candy . In spite of the open door , the stove going full tilt for the squabs and the strawberry tart made the room hot , which brought out the men 's untidy healthy body odor Eva had one of those cheap North African perfumes in a little cake like a rubber eraser , and had put that on to excess , which , alas , I fancied , was for the young Englishman 's benefit . And the mood of the room , the morality or psychology of the three together , was as confusing as this fragrant air in it . Eva stood and stared at Ricketts . Her great eyes were a little reddened ; probably she had been weeping ; at the moment she was smiling vaguely . Ricketts poured the sour red wine down his throat half a glass at a time ; and between throatfuls looked up at her with a becoming brightness . Jean pretended to be busy beside the stove with his back to them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glances over his shoulder , and replied to my questions about the tart and the cheese with a little more obscurity and more assurance than I liked . Then I happened to look outdoors . It pleased me to be able to see in a little interval between two shrubs the dreamy hawk hunched up on the rustic bench . And then , to my amazement , I saw Cullen on the left coming across the lawn . Very slowly , with a kind of noticeable alcoholic endeavor not to be noticed , on tiptoe , and as if the grass were a loud and slippery surface like a ballroom floor . . . Instantly I sensed that it was abnormal and scandalous . But I could not run out to sec what he was up to without making a little scandal myself . Jean and Eva and Ricketts would follow or at least watch . So there I stood , acting absent-minded , murmuring about the Camembert and the iced hock . Cullen vanished for a moment behind one of those two shrubs near Lucy 's perch . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his feet , and steadying himself with one hand , closer and closer to her . The grotesque furtive approach indi-cated , for one thing , that he had no rational plan , no serious intention . For Lucy was hooded as well as leashed ; she could not see him . He kept stretching out one hand , very tense ; but he could scarcely have reached her from that quadruped position . I began to think it funny . Alex and Mrs. Cullen from the bedroom window could have seen him as well as I : that was a pity . . . . Perhaps it occurred to him . He scrambled to his feet and somewhat assumed an attitude of knowing what he was about , and leaned over the bench with his back to me . Perhaps he was undoing the knot or knots of the leash . Evidently he was not alarming Lucy much ; she opened her wings a few inches , as if expecting to be picked up . But he drew back , and to my dismay , my disgust , thrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocketknife and opened it . Murder at last , I thought ; it was Lucy 's turn  --  no more Lucy ! Before I even got started to run out and stop him , he simply pushed her hard off the back of the bench , recoiling away from her at the same time . It was obvious how afraid of her he was . With a large indignant flutter she landed on the grass . He had cut the leash ; he had not cut her throat . Also he had unhoodcd her . On the grass for a moment she took a rapid confused look in every direction . Then with a great lift of her legs and two or three strokes of her wings , she climbed up on top of the air , and above the lawn , and across the pond . It was lovely . Her searching looks still , this way and that  --  to discover why she had been loosed , what quarry there was for her  --  made her appear to be shaking her head , saying no , no . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; again , when she rose beyond the scope of the kitchen window . Down she came then , with neck and wing and tail and legs all out in the shape of a six-pointed star , big and dim , collapsing . She rested her weight on the air again for an instant , and alighted on a post in the far corner of the garden . It was oneof two posts from which Eva hung Alex 's lit genie to dry early in the morning . The gesture of alighting was lovely : her rigid hands clutching the top of the post like a living victim . It might have been a little angel seizing a tall man by the hair . Then there she sat , still wondering what in the world  --  what , in terms of a hawk 's simple murderous instinct  --  this liberation meant . Meanwhile of course Cullen too had gazed up at her , gazed across the pond at her . Now like a ninny he waved good-by , good-by . Then he turned and ambled back through the bushes . Jean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorption , had not seen a thing . I was thankful for that . I also felt a childish optimism because of it . I waited a bit , to give Cullen time to get settled in the living room . Then I dashed out of the kitchen , and knocked at Alex 's bedroom door , and shouted through it to Mrs. Cullen . I simply said that Lucy was no longer on her perch . Then I hastened away to see what state of mind Cullen was in . There he sat in the living room , one leg over the arm of his easy chair , stoutly puffing , sorrowful and also smug , I thought , and somewhat sobered by his exploit ; that at least was a blessing . " The hawk has got loose . It 's not on the bench . I 've called Mrs. Cullen . She 's coming to look for it . It must have untied the knot in the leash itself . " I said this as emphatically as I could , to suggest to him the line he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked in an infuriating little tone . " I cut the leash myself , damn it all . " Whereupon I groaned or I cursed , I ca n't remember which . I did n't want him to confess ; I should have spoken to him before I called his wife ; now it was too late . She came rushing from the bedroom ; and it was as if the news had instantly disheveled her from head to foot . She shuffled with fine shoes half unlaced . Her perfect dress hung or clung round her one-sidedly . She was pulling on the blood-stained gauntlet ; and as she crossed the room she impatiently ran her other hand up through her hair , which fell down on that side over her cheek . She did not close her mouth between her voluble exclamations . " Damn , damn . Oh , I am so unhappy . I must get her back , I ca n't bear to lose her . " At the sight of her Cullen pulled himself up out of the easy chair and stood at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brave . She must have seen him ; she took no notice . I had a sense of her knowing what had happened , who had done it . She looked like the type of old Irishwoman who has second sight : old , countrified , frumpy , and frightened . And in spite of her outcries and panicky movements , it seemed to me that she had an air of experience and familiarity , familiarity with fright . " Oh , Mr. Tower , can you get me the other half of that pigeon ? " she begged . " The pigeon I fed her . She has n't , I hope she has n't , gone far away . " Upon which her husband behind us chimed in as usual , worse than usual : " Madeleine , Madeleine , surely they 've cooked it . That 's the dinner , you know , pigeons with white currants , " She took notice of that . She swung round and answered in a devilish voice , " Of course they have not cooked it " For one second I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wrinkled his nose and flung up his hands . I started toward the kitchen and she followed , explaining , " I 'll never catch her without a lure . Thank heaven it was a small pigeon , she 'll still be hungry . " She gave me a perhaps affectionate pat on the shoulder which amounted to a push . Then she ran back to the window , and there gave a wonderful small shriek . It should have been hawklike , I said to myself . What it really made me think of was a valkyrie , a very small valkyrie . For in spite of my admiration of Lucy and sympathy for the other two , I was enjoying all this . I met Alex at the kitchen door , and she had the half-pigeon . Mrs. Cullen called to us , " What in God 's name did I do with my bag ? My extra leash is in it . She must have broken hers . " Alex ran for the bag , handing me the pigeon . I dropped it , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , but they were too thrilled to do any mopping now . Then Mrs. Cullen lost one shoe and stumbled into an armchair ; and her husband knelt and tried to put it back on , fumbling round her silky ankle with those freckled fingers which could so easily have snapped it in two like a twig  --  until she lost patience and kicked the other shoe off , over his shoulder , and rose to go in her stocking feet . " Stay here , all of you , " she ordered . " Please , please , let me go alone . " She paused a moment on the threshold staring across the pond at heedless Lucy . She held her gloved fingers up to her mouth as you do when you blow a kiss . Then she swung round toward us , demanding , with a kind of loud lump in her throat , " Where in God 's name is her hood ? How wicked ! Who did it ? One of you , how wicked ! " It was poor Eva who answered , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , Madame , Madame , Jean and I never left the kitchen , " and began to cry . Alex told her to hush , which she did , more or less . As I watched our angry birdcatcher I still kept one eye on these other watchers , so assorted and attractive , there inside the house in a row close to the plate-glass window in the last murky sunshine . I thought that Alex glanced oddly back at me ; perhaps my eyewitnessing and slight complicity had given me an odd expression . Certainly she hated this disorder : obscure common blundering round her house , and general self-betrayal , with the servants goggle-eyed . On the other hand catching a great runaway bird was the sort of problem she loved . Her mild brown eyes lit up , and she breathed like a happy child . Ricketts came tiptoeing in and stood behind us as close to Eva as he dared . Whereupon Jean began whispering to her in Italian , prestissirno , until Alex hushed him too . Eva dabbed her eyes with the corner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood on it . As for Cullen , his face was quite mottled with his mixed emotions ; heavens knows what they were . As Mrs. Cullen left us , across the lawn , along the left side of the pond , I was struck by the change this emergency had made in her appearance and carriage . Perhaps it was chiefly her going in stocking feet . When she first descended from the Daimler , how delicately she had stumbled on the cobblestones , then foolishly tripped back and forth on the waxed parquet , and weakly strolled in the park ! That French or Italian footwear of hers with three-inch heels not only incapacitated her but flattered her , and disguised her . Now her breasts seemed lower on her torso , out of the way of her nervous arms . Her hips were wide and her back powerful , with that curve from the shoulder-blades to the head which you see in the nudes of Ingres . She walked with her legs well apart , one padding footfall after another , as impossible to trip up as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought an extra leash but no extra hood . She hurried back along the water and across to the rustic bench , where she picked up the one Cullen had removed and let fall ; then set out again , by the right bank , more slow and catlike as she approached her quarry . What followed took only a few moments . We heard the falconer 's cry : hai , hai , a desolate sound , which probably has not varied much in the three or four thousand years of falconry , for it is based on eternal acoustics , agreeable to the changeless ears of hawks . I loved to hear it . Lucy 's head stirred swiftly round in response to it . I wanted her to cry back , aik , which she did not . They were too far away for us to see much . We saw the swing of Mrs. Cullen 's arm as she tossed the piece ofthe pigeon over the hedge , toward the foot of the post ; and after a breathless instant , we saw Lucy 's descent upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large , dusky , finished flower off its stern . Instantly the birdcatcher bent over , lurked along the hedge , and squattingly slipped round behind it . Then we had to wait , wait  --  until she briskly stood up and started back toward us with Lucy hooded on her wrist , where she belonged . Before hooding her , I suppose , she let her have a few good beakfuls of the unscheduled pigeon so that even this mishap or misdemeanor should be a lesson to her , as it was to us all in a sense . Inside the house , before the great window , we were smiling from ear to ear , and murmuring or exclaiming each in his or her way . Only Cullen was deathly still , not even puffing . I moved far enough away from him to see his face , and found there , added to the bibulous pink , a pale light of wild relief , reprieve , even rapture , as if that horrid bird on his wife 's arm returning to haunt him again had been his heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing ; he was sober perhaps , but torrnentedly sentimental . I should not have trusted him au instant . Mrs. Cullen came down the Ieft side of the pond , the long way . The sun , muffled all afternoon , was setting brightly . Some of its beams turned back up from the water , broken into a sparkle , through which we could not see her well . There were vague irises and something else up to her ankles ; and branches of lilac occasionally hung between us and her . Her face looked to me calm , careless . Her hair still absurdly fell down one check ; now and then she blew it Out of her eyes . Dress disarranged and petticoat showing and stacking feet and all , she walked back proudly , taking her time -- -a springy walk that reminded me of Isadora Duncan . The five of us happy onlookers trooped out on the lawn to meet her . " Is n't it wonderful ? " she rejoiced . " You see , she 's perfectly manned . She under-stands . Otherwise I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in no time . Larry , go and find the other leash which I left on the bench . " And she decidedly emphasized the I. She too wished him not to admit what he had done . He went meekly for the leash . The servants returned to the kitchen . Mrs. Cullen asked permission to retire and put herself to rights , declining Alex 's offer of company and assistance . " No more weathering for you , my haggard Lucy , " I heard her mutter as she left us . I had not dared hope that Lucy  --  haggard that she was , with only two months of the least comfortable phase of captivity to look hack upon , and none of the pleasure of the chase so far , and one toe still sore from the trap  --  would allow herself to be caught . That had made the little spectacle of her capture or surrender the more exciting for me . On the other hand I had not wanted her to escape . I had not pictured her setting out lonelily over Normandy toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinctively choose . Given my sentimental imagination , it was an odd lapse . And it made me aware of my really not wanting Larry Cullen to escape from Mrs. Cullen either , or vice versa . Perhaps I do not believe in liberty , or I regard it as only episodic in life ; a circumstance that one must be able to bear and profit by when it occurs , a kind of necessary evil . When love itself is at stake , love of liberty as a rule is only fear of captivity . Alex thought a drink would help at that juncture and started to the balcony ; but with one glance in Cullen 's direction and another in mine , she returned and sat down . Cullen slumped in his armchair , gazing at apparently nothing , in that calm which is only the entire expenditure of energy , the coming down of a dull curtain upon the drama in head or heart . But probably it was only entr'acte . There was something turgid if not turbulent throughout his aging bulky frame ; his jaws stirred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept lighting up . Then we heard a persistent ringing of the bell in Alex 's room , and Alex went anxiously to see what it meant , and came back and informed us that Mrs. Cullen had decided to return to town at once , before dinner . She had a brother in Paris , and she had telephoned him ; something had gone wrong in Paris , and he needed her . I did not believe a word of this , and Alex 's expression confirmed my disbelief . Evidently it did not surprise Cullen . He sighed hard , which perhaps referred to pigeons aux groseilles ; but he said nothing even about that . Alex left it to me to inform Jean and Eva of the superfluity of their dinner . I could scarcely tell how Eva took it , not well in any case . She gaped at me and fled to her bedroom . Jean on the other hand chose to be superior and calm . Something always went wrong , he observed , when the English upper classes came to see poor Mademoiselle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little boys . In his opinion also the boy Ricketts had something to do with the escape of Madame Cullen 's eagle . At that moment the idiot was paying a visit to the bistro or bar at the corner . I let Jean go after him . The announcement of the Cullens ' change of plan might somewhat relieve his evident personal desire to put him out of the house . Meanwhile with a certain simplicity our unhappy guests gathered up their belongings here and there : severed leash and mislaid lipstick and cigarette case with a diamond button . As we waited in the hallway for the Daimler to be brought round Mrs. Cullen quietly asked . " Dear Alex , you do n't need a new chauffeur , do you ? " As it happened Alex did need one . " What luck ! I wish you 'd take Ricketts , " Mrs. Cullen quietly continued . " I 'll be giving him notice when we get to Budapest . And I know he hates Ireland and he speaks quite decent French . He 's very good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And she recommended him in other particulars as well , including semi-genteel birth . Cullen beside me was shuffling and loudly hemming , and at last could not hold his peace . " But Madeleine , really , my dear woman , you 're fantastic . We 've never had anybody as good as Ricketts . What in the world ? ! " Slightly embarrassed , Alex said that indeed they might have difficulty in finding a chauffeur in Hungary in summer ; it should not be decided in haste on her account . Perhaps she sensed what was coming ; I did . " Oh , I shall easily find another , " Mrs. Cullen said , " or I can do without . You see , Ricketts does n't like Lucy . He laughs at me up his sleeve . I doubtless am an old fool , but I can not have people around me who think so . " She said this in a great sad false way ; and it was unmistakably intended for her husband . Again I could not see Cullen 's banal but significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; we stood shoulder to shoulder facing our dear women . There was still some of that fine pre-bolshevik distillation on his somewhat accelerated and audible breath ; but its troublesome effects must have passed . We all kept silent for a moment . Mrs. Cullen was quite willing to look either of us in the eye , but her sparkle was all extinguished . It would have seemed healthier , more rational , if her eyes had looked angry ; they looked nothing at all , nullified . Lucy was hooded now ; under her mistress 's chin the frivolous topknot on the stitched leather nodded very slightly ; and Mrs. Cullen 's crooked Irish face as a whole was not much more expressive than that . Hcr serenity , her stoical wit , her obscurity were a sort of mental or moral craftsmanship  --  ornamentation . Inside all that , I suspected , her spirit was as blind as Lucy 's . The point of not allowing a hawk to see is to keep it from being frightened ; and I hoped that Mrs. Cullen 's grand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid it did not . Along the cobblestones under the plane trees I heard the Daimler come purring , not a moment too soon . By that time I also felt  --  as it seemed , aching in my bones and running in my veins and tempering my nerves  --  something like the mixture of hot and cold , good and bad , which troubled the difficult hearts of this odd couple . Unrequited passion , romance put asunder by circumstances or mistakes , sexuality pretending to be love  --  all that is a matter of little consequence , a mere voluntary temporary uneasiness , compared with the long course of true love , especially marriage . In marriage , insult arises again and again and again ; and pain has to be not only endured , but consented to ; and the amount of forgiveness that it necessitates is incredible and exhausting . When love has given satisfaction , then you discover how large a part of the rest of life is only payment for it , installment after installment . . . . That was the one definite lesson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in life I had learned it for myself well enough . It was on Alex 's account that I minded . To see the cost of love before one has felt what it is worth , is a pity ; one may never have the courage to begin . There stood the Daimler , and Cullen and I helped Mrs. Cullen and Lucy up into it , while Ricketts , cap in hand , held the door . 1 observed that in fact Ricketts was laughing , in a silent subaltern way ; but surely it was not at his mistress or her bird . Thin lips very red , rough eyelashes very shadowy ; the effect of a Moorish-Italian kiss behind the kitchen door , I fancied . Or perhaps  --  for cockneys are a malicious breed  --  the mere discomfiture of Jean amused him . He glanced over my shoulder , then up at a likely window , and so did I ; but I did not discover the Mediterranean couple peeping out anywhere . Neither the Cullens nor Alex and I had the heart for much repetition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned back to the house and shut the door before Ricketts could get the long car out on to the highway , amid ears coming toward him from Paris . There had been just time for us to reach the living room and sit down and light cigarettes , when we heard a fearful grinding of brakes , then several cars honking as in panic , and a Frenchman shouting the usual insults . A moment after , a car drove in under our plane trees . I got up and looked out a small window on that side ; it was the Daimler . Alex and I hastened back through the hall to see what had happened . There we heard Mrs. Cullen 's voice , very loud and exclamatory but incomprehensible ; and she was pushing the doorbell , rattling the doorknob , and calling , " Alex , Alex I " As I opened the door she stepped back , turning away from us , gesticulating and exclaiming , " No , Ricketts , stay where you are . Larry , please ! Now wait for me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool ! " She stumbled on the cobblestones ; Lucy was having a hard time . Then she returned to us and grasped Alex 's arm and motioned us back inside the house . " Do n't get out of the car , Larry , I 'll attend to it , " she cried , over her shoulder . " Alex , dear , I 'm sorry , I 've forgotten something . Poor silly fool , " she repeated . By the heartbroken tone of her voice I judged that the fool was not Ricketts . That young man was not laughing now nor smacking his lips upon any recollection of pleasure or rivalry . His lips were white ; he was badly frightened . The Daimler stood at a very odd angle between two trees ; he must have made a U-turn on the highway . A little farther along on the verge of a ditch stood an old Renault , with which , I supposed , they had narrowly escaped a collision . Its French driver stood beside it , still vehemently expressing himself , shaking his fist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even glanced in that Frenchman 's direction . Something else musthave happened ; just before , just after , or at the same time . Inside the Daimler , Cullen had his great hand pressed over his mouth as if he were gnawing it , and he too was pale : the worst pallor in the world , like cooked veal . During the little drama of recapturing Lucy he had ceased to be drunk , I thought . But now I was afraid that he was going to be sick . Alex and I followed Mrs. Cullen inside the house . She too was in a worse emotion and looked worse than before . Not only a portion of her lovely hair but her hat as well this time hung over one ear . There were beads of sweat on her brow and her upper lip . " Oh , Alex , do forgive us , " she kept saying , " I 'm so ashamed , so ashamed " ; and hurried past us into the living room . Shame , I must say , was one thing which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of waxed parquet toward the garden door she sped ahead of us  --  her too pretty feet on her too high heels wide apart , lest she skid and fall headlong  --  saying to Alex over her shoulder , " Excuse me . Please , dear . Do n't mind me . Let me go into the garden alone a minute . " On her wrist of course Lucy still perched , that is , rode , with some difficulty ; her green-gold feet also wide apart , ducking or dipping to keep her balance , with characteristic indignation of her shoulders and that nervous puffing of breast feather which , as Mrs. Cullen had informed us , is a good sign in a hunting hawk . Hawks are not really tree birds ; and if in a state of nature Lucy had ever found herself on a perch as agitated as this female arm , blown by any such passionate wind as this , whatever this was  --  she would have left it instantly and sought out a rock . It was absurd . Even her little blind headgear with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French hat which her mistress was wearing at so Irish an angle , except that it was provided with secure drawstrings . In spite of my bewilderment and alarm , I began to laugh . It struck me as a completion of the cycle of the afternoon , an end of the sequence of meanings I had been reading into everything , especially Lucy . The all-embracing symbolic bird , primitive image with iron wings and rusty tassels and enameled feet , airy murderess like an angel , predatory sanguinary de luxe hen  --  now she was funny ; she had not seemed funny before . Perhaps all pets , all domesticated animals , no matter how ancient or beautiful or strange , show a comic aspect sooner or later ; a part of the shame of our humanity that we gradually convey to them . Just then I saw what Mrs. Cullen had in her right hand , half concealed against her breast and behind Lucy 's wing : a large revolver . Alex must have seen it before I did . She was clinging to my elbow and whispering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't follow her . " I am not a judge of firearms , but this was a grim , important object , glimmering , apparently brand-new and in working order . " Shall I try to take it away from her ? " I asked Alex in a whisper . " Heavens , no . She 'll be all right . Do n't worry her . " Women , even some young girls , have this ability to guess at degrees of trouble , this equanimity of a trained nurse . And , with or without much affection , they sometimes suddenly know each other as if they were twins . There was more to it than that . Looking back on that moment , I have wondered just how her friend 's passion appeared to Alex . How could she tell , as the disheveled creature fled ahead of us into the garden , that she was not going to kill herself ? Then it occurred to me that in my friend 's character and way of life in those days there was a certain passivity ; at least abstention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about them might , she felt , be more awful than anything she could imagine . If others said things were unbearable , she could well believe it . If the Irishwoman 's life had reached that point , the point of suicide , perhaps she would not have cared to interfere or prevent it . Outside on the terrace Mrs. Cullen stopped ; and grasping the gun by the barrel , brought it back over her shoulder and hurled it high above the shrubs , far across the lawn , so that it splashed into the pond . This important gesture was too much for Lucy . Off the dear wrist she went , hung in a paroxysm once more . But this time it was not bating , not mystical dread or symbolical love of liberty ; it was just ordinary loss of balance . Symbol or no symbol , I said to myself , if I were busy getting rid of a suicidal or murderous weapon I should hate to have a heavy hysterical bird tied to me , yanking my wrist , flapping in my face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps because of her own hysteria  --  the real meaning of this episode pulling at her heartstrings and beating upon her intellect  --  she merely did the thing to do , as usual . . . Up went her embattled left arm over her head ; stock-still she stood , until terrible Lucy grew tired , and recovered her self-control , and resumed her domestication . From our point of view , behind her , seeing her through the sunset-streaked window , against the background of the old park and the shrubs and the gray pond with ripples unclosing away from the place where the gun had gone down , Mrs. Cullen was beautiful . Throughout her somewhat bulky body  --  motherly torso and panting breast and round neck ? there was wonderful strength ; and between her absurd high heels and her fist in the rough glove , there was exact perpendicularity : the yard-wide wings now settling back on top . And the fact that she looked a bit ridiculous , disheveled and second-rate and past her prime , made it all the finer , I thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were tears in her eyes , but she chuckled , or pretended to , or tried to . " Darling Alex , " she said hoarsely , " did you ever have guests who behaved so madly ? Do n't , please , do n't ever ask me what this was all about . " Then in her way , in a series of little dull , prosaic , but shameless statements , she told us what it was about . " You see , dear , why we ca n't live in Ireland . It 's such a bad example for my silly sons . " My presence did not make her shy . For a moment that flattered me ; upon second thought it seemed to me to have the opposite implication . Quite early in the afternoon , I suppose , she had perceived that Alex was not in love with me ; therefore , in her view of life , I did not count , I was a supernumerary . What harm could I do with her secrets ? Women are fantastic . Holding her left arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her right arm somewhat round Alex and kissed her . " Dear , dear friend , " she murmured . " You 're so clever , you 'll marry well when the time comes . Thank you so much for your patience with us . " Alex shrank a little , as she always did from female affection , but the odd compliment seemed to please her . " Larry 's been threatening to leave me for weeks , " Mrs. Cullen added . " Oh , I 'm so afraid he will one day I do n't know what would become of him by himself , the fool , the old darling . " Poor Larry , I sighed ; poor supernumerary me ! Women are no respecters of men . I also felt a little indignation on Lucy 's account . Trapped out of the real wind and rock , and perverted rather than domesticated , kept blind and childish , at the mercy of every human absurdity , vodka and automobiles , guns and kisses : poor Lucy ! She no doubt personified for Mrs. Cullen the deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large part of her life to her . Yet again and again , splendid falco 's position in fact , her proprietress 's handling of her was in the way of a handkerchief or a muff or a hat . Absorbed in her narration of what had just occurred on the highway in the Daimler , Mrs. Cullen forgot about her , and gestured a little with her left hand as well as her right . Lucy had to embrace the air desperately to stabilize herself ; her plumage all thickened up and homely , sick-looking . It afforded me an instant 's characteristic grim amusement to think how often the great issues which I had taken this bird to augur , come down in fact to undignified appearance , petty neurasthenic anecdote ; bring one in fact at last to a poor domestication like Lucy 's . It also reminded me of the absurd position of the artist in the midst of the disorders of those who honor and support him , but who can scarcely be expected to keep quiet round him for art 's sake . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting , " Mrs. Cullen said . " Wife or chauffeur or haggard . I dare say I never shall know , unless some day he does it . The minute you closed your door he began saying things at the top of his voice about Lucy and Ricketts . It upset Ricketts , and there was a car coming toward us , and for a moment I really thought we should crash . I told Ricketts to stop at the side of the road , and instead he turned back here , with two other cars speeding round the corner . That was what made the little Frenchman in the Renault angry . In the midst of which poor Larry began to threaten us with the revolver . It was in the side pocket of the car . I ca n't imagine when he put it there , or where he got it . You know , I think the Frenchman saw it . Lucky for us he did n't call the police . " She began to have an almost cheerful expression . If you have been lonelily excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no validation for your fear in fact , no excuse that others would understand  --  perhaps the trouble in question must always come as a slight relief . At least you know then that you have not morbidly made it all up out of whole cloth . " I 'll tell you an odd thing about myself , " she said , with her vaguest smile . " I happen to be a very good shot ; and d' you know , all the while I was trying to take that beastly gun away from Larry ? with Ricketts driving like a fool , and poor Lucy on my arm so awfully in the way  --  I kept calculating every instant just where the bullet would go if he pulled the trigger . The trajectory and all that . I suppose I 'm a born sportswoman ; it 's childish , is n't it ? At the last moment I simply ca n't take things quite seriously . I suppose that 's what made me good at lions in Kenya years ago . " She frowned and sighed then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now Ricketts of course is quite out of patience with Larry . I suppose I shall have to give him notice ; what a pity ! If Larry was n't quiet after I got out of the car I expect Ricketts knocked him out . He did once before . There 's nothing I can do ; Larry is as strong as an ox . But I 'd have gone mad , I 'd have killed Ricketts  --  if I had waited to see what happened . Ricketts is so damned English ; the instant he clenches his fist he makes a smug face , like a governess . But I dare say it 's time to go back now . I 've been cowardly long enough ; perhaps at this point I can be of some comfort to my man . " She intended to give Alex another kiss , but Alex avoided it . " Oh , Alex , I do , " she lamented , " do love that great fool desperately . Whatever shall I do with him ? Oh , well , we 'll sec . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was astonishing , you know , how well Larry hawked last summer in Hungary . I thought he 'd enjoy it so . " Then she laughed , and all afternoon I think she had not laughed ; rather a bad sound , two loud liquid feverish notes . " Ho , ho , perhaps this may have done him good . He has bated , do n't you know . " So she took her second departure . " Good-by , Mr. Tower . Good-by , Alex , dear child . I shall miss you . Larry will be ashamed to see you after all this , I 'm afraid . Do n't come out to the car ; it would embarrass them . " She slipped across the hall and out the door , opening it only a little and immediately slamming it . " Well ? " exclaimed Alex , as we returned to the living room , and her delivery of that syllable made me laugh : 000-eIl ; the soft bark of a very small dog . After so much disorder we thought it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wandered into the garden , sighing , tired . " I hope Jean and Eva did not see this last bit of melodrama , " Alex said . " It 's not the kind of idea I should like him to get into his head and develop . He 's no Cullen ; he 's an imitative Italian , and he might not muff it . " " That great comfortable , greedy , easy old boy , " I mumbled , meaning Cullen . " Did you dream he had murder in him ? Vodka or no vodka . " " But it was suicide surely , not murder , " said Alex . " Madeleine Cullen has no imagination . " " I wonder . It overlaps in any case , People do kill themselves just because they want to murder someone , " I replied in my quibbling way . " Someone they love . " Alex made a little face , expressive of skepticism of everything and practically universal disapproval . " But you know , he was n't really very drunk . " " Two shakerfuls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No matter . That 's not much for those immense Irishmen . I 've seen him drunk and it was n't anything like this at all . Or perhaps he pretended to be drunk for your benefit , and to have an excuse for what was happening anyway ; what was bound to happen . You 're such a sober creature , my dear ; you naturally overestimate other people 's intoxication . " Her saying that made me suddenly unhappy . I thought of the wicked way I had watched him as he drank , the grandiose theories of drunkenness I had spun for myself meanwhile ; and I blushed . Half the time , I am afraid , my opinion of people is just guessing ; cartooning . Again and again I give way to a kind of inexact and vengeful lyricism ; I can not tell what right I have to be avenged , and I am ashamed of it . Sometimes I entirely doubt my judgment in moral matters ; and so long as I propose to be a story-teller , that must be the whisper of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensed , as a good young woman should , my doubt and weak self-criticism ; and she smiled . " You must tell me what he said to you before you forget it . I gathered from your expression that he 'd been weeping on your shoulder . " Then Eva , with even Tess etiquette than usual , came out of the kitchen waving a napkin , huskily imploring us to hurry in to dinner , half-spoiled in any case , she thought . As if to point the moral of the changes of the day from a cook 's angle , Jean sent in to us eight pigeons , a veritable sheaf of asparagus , and two good-sized tarts . It was perfect ; and melodrama all afternoon evidently gave us appetite . Eva shed tears while she served , but mutely and prettily , with a wan smile whenever I looked at her , like a seventeenth-century Magdalen . Jean brought the tart himself and thanked us for our overeating as if it had been a special effort to console him . After he had served our coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen from the kitchen window . I was surprised to learn that she too had seen it , from her bedroom window , while Mrs. Cullen lay stretched on the bed with her eyes shut . But she had missed the jackknife . Then I tried to remember and report to her Cullen 's confession to me , man to man over our vodka , which entertained her , although I think it shocked her . Then she went to write a note and send a telegram , and she did not return for three-quarters of an hour . I sat there by myself , not even trying to read . I was still excited ; and I fell into a form of fatigued stupidity which , while it lasts , often seems to me an important intellectual effort . It was an effort to compress the excessive details of the afternoon into an abstraction or two , a formula or a moral ; in order to store that away in my head for future use , and yet leave room for something new , for the next thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . I also hoped to distinguish a little more clearly between what the Cullens meant to me and certain fine points of my own meaning to myself which had fascinated me in the midst of their afternoon 's performance . Of course it was not possible . I have Iearned  --  but again and again I forget  --  that abstraction is a bad thing , innumerable and infinitesimal and tiresome ; worse than any amount of petty fact . The emotion that comes blurring my retrospect is warmer and weaker than the excitement of whatever happened , good or bad . It is like a useless , fruitless vegetation , spreading and twining and fading and corrupting ; even the ego disappears under it . . . Therefore I scarcely noticed how long my dear friend stayed away in her bedroom ; therefore I was glad when she came back . For me , putting a stop to so-called thought is one of the functions of friendship . It was not writing or telegraphing which had kept her ; it was Eva weeping and denouncing Jean , laughing and worshiping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had gone to the village to get drunk . He would kill her , he had said , and sooner or later he might well , Eva thought ; certainly he would beat her the minute he returned . He was the most jealous man alive , in her opinion , and she worshiped him . In any case she was much to blame . She had a way of obviously reveling in the sense of her own beauty whenever a new man appeared in the kitchen ; a look of being at the mercy of circumstances , or perhaps at the man 's mercy . Neighbor or workman or tradesman would appear ; and casually Eva would come up , and stand close by , with a sleepy stare , letting her eyes drop sideways in their wide sockets amid African eyelashes , giving off her sweetness like a flower bed  --  while Jean watched her , admiring and suffering , until his storm broke . Alex had asked what made her behave so ; why she flirted with men like Ricketts if she loved Jean and wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained that , when she flirted it gave him a chance to come between her and the rival , which made her feel his love , and to that of course she promptly yielded ; and her yielding also gave him assurance that she loved him . " And if you please , the female beast ! " said Alex , " she laughed as she explained it , deep in her fat throat . " But she would not go on laughing . This time , she thinks , it has gone too far . He will beat her , and he may kill her , and tutti quanti . Therefore she began to cry again , and she wanted to tell me the story again from the beginning . I pretended to lose my temper and sent her to bed . " I shall have to dismiss them , you know , if they go on like this , " Alex added . " The lower classes have a way of making one ashamed of one 's sex . " She always had trouble with servants . The trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aroused at all , soon went too far . Shrinking from them , but pinned down by them at last , she gave a great deal of the warmth that lay in her .
