THE BATTLE OF FINNEY 'S FORD A Story JESSAMYN WEST F OR Josh Birdwell , no man of war , no man even , if it takes twenty-one years to make you that , the threat of war had each day been coming closer . On the morning of the 1 1 th that threat caught up with and enveloped him . Except for the name of Morgan the 11th had opened up like any other morning in July ; clear , with promise of heat to come . Overhead arched the great cloudless sky of summer , tranquil above the reports , the rumors , the whisperings , the fears . And above the true evidence : the evidence brought in by the eye witnesses ; by the boy who had hid himself and horse in the thicket while Morgan 's outriders galloped past ; by the girl who had waded along the branch and was not seen ; the stories of the burnings , the shootings , the looting . Morgan 's name had been heard in the southern counties before July , but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . Women stopped their dashers to listen , children stayed away from the wood lots , men worked quietly behind their horses foregoing all talk lest their words muffle the approach of Morgan 's scouts . But it was the young men who listened most intently , the skin tightening across their cheekbones . Not with apprehension or fear so much as with wonder . What would they do if the hoofbeats along thewoods ' trace were made by John Morgan 's men ? If the press-gang said , " Unhitch your horses , bub , bring out your hams and bacon , show us where the old man keeps his silver " ? Would they unhitch , the young men wondered , hand over Prince and Dolly , walk up through the fine dust of the field-path , lay the meat and silver on the outstretched hands ? Would they ? The young men did not know . They had no way of knowing . Josh had listened without a word as Ben Whitey talked . " I was there , " Ben finished . " I saw it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw old man Yardley shot . I 'll give myself two hours to rest , then head for Vernon . It 's my aim to join the Home Guard and fight John Morgan till he 's killed or pushed back across the Ohio . " Josh looked , not at his friend , but at his shadow which was long and still upon the dusty lane . Heat waves already rippled across the well-tasseled corn ; the Whiteys ' windmill turned round three or four times with considerable speed , then stopped as if forever . " I 'm going with thee , " Josh said . Ben Whitey lifted himself wearily from against the side of the house . " You 're a Quaker . Your folks 'll never let you . " Josh did n't argue with him . " I 'll meet thee at the Milford cut-off in two hours . " Ben Whitey turned toward the door . " 1 wo n't wait for you , " he warned . " I 'll go straight on if you 're not there . " " Thee wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Josh said , He turned homeward , running heavily through the early morning heat . REAKFAST was over when he stepped into the summer kitchen . He was astonished to see the nearly empty gravy bowl , the meat platter with its single egg , the plates crusted with jam and biscuit crumbs . It was a wonder to Josh that on such a morning people had been able to put gravy on biscuits , to spear slices of ham ; a morning on which their neighbors were being killed . He stopped behind the chair in which his brother , Little Jess , sat . He knew , in his self-conscious way , that his family was looking at him and he made a strong effort to control his feelings . He was particularly aware of his brother Labe 's cairn , cool gaze and he thought of it as being belittling ; that Labe , who was muscular , smooth-jointed , supple , considered him a scarecrow with his black hair like a wig , his high-burning cheekbones , his lopsided mouth which trembled when he was in earnest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , son ? " his father asked . " I was over at the Whiteys ' . " " Set , set . Josh , " his mother bade , bustling up from her place . " I 'll fry thee fresh eggs . " " I could n't swallow an egg , " Josh said . " What do they hear at the Whiteys ' ? " asked his father . " Morgan 's heading this way , he 's following the railroad up from Vienna . He 's making for Vernon . He 'll be there today or tomorrow . " " Vernon , " said his mother . She put the two eggs she had in her hand back in the egg crock . Vernon was home . Josh had as well said the south forty . " How do they know so much over at the Whiteys ' ? " his father asked . " Morgan did n't cross the Ohio till evening of fourth day . Morgan 's lost out there in the woods . . got guerrillas trained to stay out of sight . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where John Morgan is . Tell you whether he 's shaved yet this morning and where he 'll be this time tomorrow . " " People at breakfast tables , " Josh began angrily , then stopped . " Ben Whitey was in Harrison County when Morgan crossed over . He 's been riding ahead of him for three days . " " Did thee talk to Ben ? " " What 'd Ben have to say ? " " Nothing about whether Morgan 'd shaved or not this morning . " " Son , " said his father , " sit thyself down and tell us . " Josh , without intending to do so , sat suddenly in the chair which was pushed out for him , and also without conscious intent began to chew hurriedly on a cold biscuit . his mother made a gesture toward passing him butter and jam , but Jess shook his head and said , " Well , Josh ? " Josh spoke rapidly , his voice a little muffled by the dry biscuit crumbs . " Ben Whitey passed a dozen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blocher . Not morc'n twenty miles from Vernon . They 're following the railroad . They 'll raid Vernon . " " Raid Vernon , " said his mother . " What does that mean ? " It was a word whose meaning on the page of any book she knew perfectly well . But " Raid Vernon " ? the town where she sold her eggs , the church town , the county fair town , with its whitewashed brick houses , its quiet , dusty streets , its snowball bushes dangling their white blossoms over the unpainted picket fences whatdid that mean ? " Raid Vernon , " she said once again as if the words themselves might somehow suddenly focus , as a stereopticon glass did when given just the proper shove , to show a landscape , lifelike in its dimensions , distances  --  and ruin . Josh knew what the word meant . Ben Whitey had told him . " Raid means , " he told his mother , " burn , kill , take what you want . " " Are Morgan 's men killing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world his mother saw flickered before Josh 's eyes : a world of such loving companionableness that the word war had no other meaning for her than murder ; where deliberate killing was as unthinkable as though in her own household son should turn on son ; but it flickered for a second only , then disappeared leaving him angry again . " Does n't thee know there 's a war ? " Josh asked with intensity . " Does n't thee know what a war is ? " " Thy mother knows there 's a war , Josh , " his father reminded him , " but she do n't know what a war is . Let alone what a war in Vernon 'd be like . She 's more used to think of caring for people than killing them . " " John Morgan thinks of killing them , " Josh said . " He shot a boy through the legs who did n't run fast enough . He shot an old man in the back . I do n't know how many 's dead in Harrison County . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's burnings the whole way up . He said he did n't think there was a mill left standing in Harrison County . He said the country 's scoured of horses  --  and anything else in any house a trooper wanted and could carry across his saddle bow . " Eliza leaned across the table . " The earth , " she said , " and the fullness thereof , is the Lord 's . What 's Morgan 's men but a ruckus of boys with their pants in their boots ? Trying to get something they 've never had a taste of before ? We 've got morc'n we need here . High time we 're called on to share it with someone . If John Morgan 's men came here , " Eliza said  --  and Josh saw his mother 's eyes turn toward the door of the summer kitchen as if she saw there a dusty , slouch-hatted trooper , " I 'd offer them the best I had on hand . No man 's my enemy , " she said . Josh stood up , crumbling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Some men arc my enemies , " he said . " Any man 's my enemy who kills innocent men and makes slaves . They 're my mortal enemies . " Josh felt his sister Mattie 's hand , longfingered  --  and cold for so warm a morning  --  touch , then feel its way into his clenched fist , and he gave way to its insistent downward pressure and sat again . " I will share with my friends , " he said , " but if thee gives all thee 's got to a thief , thy friends will : have to go hungrythere 's not enough to go round . What 's good about that ? " he asked . " I 'd rather die . " There was a long silence about the breakfast table . Eliza reseated herself . Little Jess looked from face to face with nervousness . He was embarrassed when grownups showed emotion . Mattie , because she oscillated between two ways of seeing , suffered : when she was generous and peaceful as was her mother , she thought herself a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight ( she supposed ) she felt herself a renegade , an outcast from faith and scriptures . Only Labe sat quietly , his calm face touched neither by sorrow nor eagerness . Only one way opened before him , and except that he believed this to be a matter between his mother and brother , and presently his father , he would have spoken and said more convincing words , he thought , for loving all men than his mother had . TN THE long silence , while there was no IL talk , sounds of great clarity filled the room . All , except Little Jess , harkened to them as if they were omens  --  as if each , properly apprehended , might carry some kind of a revelation : the slow grating start of the windmill casing into rhythmic clicking as the wind freshened ; two distant notes as Old Bess , the bell-cow , reached forward toward uncropped grass ; the prolonged , sweet morning trill of a small bird which , undesired either by raiders or raided , flew , singing , near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his place at the head of the table , looked down toward his eldest son . He bent upon him a face of so much love and regard  --  and good humor , too , as if behind this talk of war there were still a few reasons to laugh  --  that Josh thought he might be unable to bear his father 's gaze , would have to lay his arms across the table and bury his face in them , and so hidden , say , " Yes , pa , " or " No , pa , " to whatever his father had to say . But as his father continued to gaze , quizzically and lovingly , Josh knew that he had left behind him forever the happy time of freedom from decision and sat very straight , back teeth clamped together . lins &ern.; bling , quietly waiting his father 's word . " Thee knows , Josh , " his father said , " dying 's only half of it . Any of us here , I hope , " ? and Jess included Little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is ready to die for what he believes . If it 's asked of us and can be turned to good account . I 'm not for dying , willy-nilly , thee understands , " Jess said , his big nose wrinkling at the bridge . " It 's an awful final thing , and more often than not nobody 's much discommoded by it , except thyself , but there are times when it 's the only answer a man can give to certain questions . Then I 'm for it . But thee 's not been asked such a question now , Josh . Thee can go out on the Pike , and if thee can find John Morgan , die there in front of him by his own hand if thee can manage it , and nothing ' 11 be decided . He 'll move right on and thee 'll be back there on the Pike just as dead and just as forgotten as if thee 'd tied a stone round thy neck and jumped off Clifty Falls . No , Josh , dying wo n't turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now  --  is kill . " The word hung in the air . A fly circled the table , loudly and slowly , and still the sound of the word was there . . ? louder than the ugly humming . It hung in the air like an open wound . Kill . In the Quaker household the word was bare and stark . Bare as in Cain and Abel 's time with none of the panoply of wars and regiments and campaigns to clothe it . Kill . Kill a man . - Kill thy brother . Josh regarded the word . He explored it , his hand tightening about the case knife in his hand . " I know that , " he said . " I am ready to fight " But that would n't do . He could not pretend that he was ready for the necessary act so long as he flinched away  --  from even the word . " I will kill these men if I have to . " " No , Josh , " Eliza said . Josh was glad to be relieved of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He turned to his mother . " Yes , " he said . " I will . I 'm going to meet Ben Whitey at eight . Soon as he 's had two hours of rest . The Governor 's made a proclamation . Every man 's to join the Home Guard and help defend his t. ; rri-bt Anun , tr , Vernon MAGAZINE and join . Morgan 'll be there anytime . I 'd ought to 've gone a week ago . " " Joshua , Joshua , " cried his mother . " Thy great great grandfather came here with William Penn to establish ways of peace . And he did , " Eliza declared passionately . " With savage Indians . Men of blood . Now thee proves thyself to be worse than the Indians . They kept the peace . " Josh felt better . The picture of himself as bloodier than a savage Indian was so fantastic it hid for the time such savagery and bloodthirstiness as he did possess  --  and hid too , what Josh felt to be perhaps even worse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Indians , " he said , " were n't dealing with John Morgan . " Jess spoke . " Josh , " he said , " those who take the sword shall perish by it . " They were back to dying : only a nicer word . " I am ready to perish , " said Josh . But Jess would n't let them stay there . " Thou shalt not kill , " said Jess . There it was . " But He said , render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar 's , " Josh said desperately . " I live here . . . in Jennings County . My town is Vernon . The governor said to defend it . My body is my country 's . " " Thy soul , son , is God 's . " " God wo n't want it , " Josh said , " if I do n't do what I think 's my duty . " He was standing again , half crying , a horrible way for a man to be starting to war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ca n't . I do n't want to die . . . and I do n't even know if I could kill anyone if I tried . But I got to try , " he said , " as long as people around me have to . I 'm no better'n they are . I ca n't be separated from them . " He left the table and ran toward the kitchen stairway . " I 'm going , " he said . " I 'm meeting Ben Whitey at eight . " As he went up the stairs he heard his father say , " No , Eliza , no . " A TOP his own horse , lumbering , unwarlike Old Snorty , Josh tried to carry himself like a Home Guardsman . He rode down the dusty road toward the Milford cut-off scanning the horizon for signs of Morgan and his raiders , keeping an eye THE BATTLE OF out for single horsemen . If outriders of Morgan 's had been only twenty miles away last night they might easily turn up at any crossroads now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a militiaman already , sworn to hunt down and stop or kill ? John Morgan , Josh could not accustom his mind to the idea of shooting a man . He tried to think how it would be : to come upon a man , emerging from the woods say , or around a sharp turn , and not speak , not pause to pass the time of day , but instantly with raised musket to fire and hope to blow the stranger 's head off . The idea made Josh sweat . My God , he thought , or prayed , he did n't know which , I hope it 's no boy , no old man . Then remembering that Morgan 's raiders were themselves handy with firearms he settled deeper in his saddle and listened more intently . Ben Whitey was early , waiting at the cut-off , impatient and fuming as Josh rode up . " 1 shouldn't 've waited , " he yelled . " I should 've gone on . " " We 'll make up for it now , " Josh told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking back down the Pike said , " Looks like your brother Labe on Rome Beauty . He joining too ? " " No , " Josh said , " Labe 's got convictions the other way . " " Well , you forgot something then , " Ben Whitey said with disgust , " and your ma 's sending it to you . " He rode on while Josh turned back to meet Labe . Labe came up at a long trot , the only kind Rome Beauty had , dismounted , and said , " Get on . Father said for thee to take Rome . Old Snorty 's no horse to go to war with . " Josh sat atop Old Snorty , unmoving , unbelieving . " Get down , " said Labe . " If thee 's going to fight Morgan , fight him . Do n't set there like a bump on a log . " " Father 's against my going , " said Josh . " He 's against it , but that did n't stop thee . Now get on . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quaker . From all he can tell , thee and Rome think about alike . Get on . " Josh got off Snorty , transferred his bed roll to Rome 's saddle , and stood in the dusty road beside his brother . He was taller than Labe but Labe 's shoulders and stance made him feel small . " Tell father , " he began , but Labe interrupted him . " Father said to tell thee most killing 's caused by fear . . . . Rome 's being under thee ought to help a little . He do n't send thee Rome because his mind 's changed about anything . " " Labe , " Josh asked , " thee do n't think about going ? " " No , " said Labe , " I do n't . " " I got to , " said Josh . " Otherwise I 'd always think maybe it was because . . . " " Get on , " said Labe , giving him no time to finish . Astride the big red horse Josh rode after Ben Whitey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I am afraid , " he said . " You got a fine mount now , " Ben Whitey told him when he drew alongside . " If you can just keep his nose headed the right direction you ought to make out . " " Never thee fear , " Josh began . . . but he shut his mouth at that point . " Thee do n't know , " he told himself . T HEY rode into Vernon together  --  a roan and a claybank , two rawboned farm boys : Ben Whitey , a born fighter , and Josh who was trying to do his duty . They entered Vernon and saw it the way a man who thinks he has been dreaming wakes and sees the landscape of his dream lying all about him ; the disaster real , hard , and unmelting as sunlight  --  and dreaming the only means of escape Deep in the country , on the farms , they had believed  --  and not believed . To come here with loaded guns had been an act of faith and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed ; he was killing and looting ; he would be here at any hour . There were tens of mouths to tell them . The town blazed under the July sun ; it throbbed with the heat of the season  --  and the heat of fear and excitement and wonder and resolution . At first Josh thought it was alive as he had seen it for an August fair , or Fourth of July celebration . And there was something of a holiday spirit in the plunging , headlong activity . As if after fifty years of watching . the rh6r  --  ri alternations of the seasons , Vernon had tired of its placid punkin-butter existence and had turned with relish to something with a sharper flavor . That was the surface : the movement , the shouts , the numbers of horses in the street , the vehicles , the laughter even ; a holiday roar and the excess movements of a celebration when steps reach higher and higher into the air , bows go lower and lower toward earth , and smiles strain at the limitations of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to regard the sights and sounds singly , he saw there was no holiday . There were spring wagons , gigs , democrats , buckboards , all filled with women , children , and valuables and headed for back country and the hills . There were men digging deep holes , preparing to bury silver , money , keepsakes , whatever they and their wives cherished and thought a raider might fancy . There were boys barricading doors , boarding up windows , reinforcing bolts . There was a man who had turned his house into a store and was now busy trying to make his store look like a house again . There was an old fellow atop the gable of his house , peering off to the south through a long spyglass . The voices , too , when Josh listened to them , were not celebrating anything : they rasped ; they started even , then broke ; a man began yelling , looked around , ended whispering . " Let 's get out of this , " Ben Whitey said . " Let 's find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man beckoned to them . " Want to mix in it ? " he asked . " That 's what we 're here for . Where 's the Home Guard ? " Ben Whitey asked . " Everywhere , " said the old man . He picked up the end of his long beard and used it to point with . " Spread thin , but mostly to the south . Morgan could circle us  --  but reports are he 's hitting us solid from the south . Coming up the railroad from Vienna . They got companies posted at every ford , road , and bridge south of town . " " Where you figger we could do the most good ? " " South Fork bridge . I been thinking about this for two days . I figger John Morgan , being the man he is , will come straight in , cross the South Fork bridge , and bust into town from there . If you want to get in some telling licks , that 's the place I 'd head for . " " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muscatatuck where the South Fork bridge crosses it flows between banks of considerable height . Here the Home Guard commander had massed as many men as could be spared from the other approaches to Vernon . Of these the majority , and among them the men Colonel Williams considered most steady and level headed , were stationed on the west bank of the stream ready to fall upon the raiders should the smaller force which was holding the approaches to the bridge be overpowered . The colonel hoped to stop , if possible by a show of force , if not , by force itself , any thrust the raiders might make before they reached the bridge . Failing this , the guard on the west bank would have a fine chance to pick off the raiders as they debouched from the bridge and headed toward town . That was the plan . The captain in command of the river could use as many men as he could get , and when Ben and Josh showed up , well mounted , he sent them at once to join the company beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loose but well planned alignment He put the two newcomers in the front line . It was his practice to keep untried men , of whom he knew nothing , away from rear lines where in the shock and excitement of a charge they might break and run . Up front , with veterans behind them and an enemy firing into them , they would have very little choice but to steady and fight . " They 're headed this way , " the captain told them . " Some of them , " he said , pointing , " are sitting right there on top of that hill . Them , we fooled . Our men marched across the cliff road and then out of sight of Morgan if he 's there  --  a half dozen times over . Musta looked like quite an army to him . But there 's likely others and they may be here soon . If we do n't stop them nothing will . Once they 're past us , it will be Maukport and Salem and Lexington all over again . THE BATTLE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses , but stay by them and keep them quiet . I 'm glad you 're here . I need you . " Overhead the July sun had weight as well as heat . It lay across Josh 's shoulders like a burning timber . Though Ben was on one side of him , and big Gum Anson , a beefy farmer , was on the other , still Josh felt bereft of shelter , unshielded and alone ? a naked target . For a long timc he scanned the road before him with rigid and unrelaxing vigilance . There was not much to be seen : the dusty road , the lush growth of summer ; dock , volunteer oats , some daisies , a small field of shoulder-high corn , and beyond these a thicket and the road curving out of sight around it . Above earth and river and the river 's rank growth were the heat waves , the massive clouds of noon skies , the burning sun . Josh , who felt as if the whole duty of seeing and apprising rested with him , inspected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air fluttered the leaves of the elders up the road and rasped through the corn he lifted his gun , then put it down shamefacedly . He could feel the sweat trickle down the sides of his chest , then drop to his middle and soak in around his belt . " Have some cherries , " said Gum . " You ca n't keep that up all afternoon . " He held out a big bag . The cherries were cool and firm and Josh took a handful . " When Nance brought these out this morning , " Gum said , " I 'd ' ye thrown ' em down except to please her . Gain ' off to fight Morgan with a bag of cherries tied to my saddle like a doggone picnicker . " He munched away and spat seeds . " Looks like they might be the handiest article I brought . " " Wait 'll Morgan gets here , Gum , " somebody yelled . " It 's gon na take more'n cherry stones to stop that old shite-poke . " " I got more'n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around him laughed . Josh looked about , amazed at the sound of laughter , amazed that men waiting to kill or be killed could laugh and joke . He scanned the faces of those who were laughing : old fellows , middle-aged farmers , boys younger than himself . Sweating , chewing tobacco , some dismounted , others lolling in their saddles . Some in uniform , most not . Mounted on farm plugs . Mounted on fast animals he 'd seen at county fairs . Every kind of firearms . One man with a bayonet , even . The sight of that lifted Josh up very straight . Did the raiders carry bayonets ? His sweating , which he had not noticed for a while , had started up once more . " Have some more cherries ? " asked Gum . Josh took another handful . " Thanks , " he said . " I was awful dry . And hungry , too . I ca n't remember when I had anything to eat last . " " Go kinda slow on them cherries , then . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They 're setting good on mine , " Josh said , chewing and spitting , but keeping his eyes up-road . " Take it easy , " advised Gum again looking at Josh . " You 'll be petered out before Johnny gets here . They 's scouts up ahead . They 'll let us know if anything 's twitchin ' . " Josh felt a fool not to have thought of that before : rearing up till his backbone was petrified , and staring till his eyes popped , acting as if he were scout , trooper , captain , everything . He noticed that the other men were relaxed , guns dangling , or laid across their bed roils , some smoking ; a man behind him was having a nip of something that did n't smell like switchel . " Old Morgan'El never come this way , " one bearded farmer was saying . " That boy 's shiftier than a creased buck . He ai n't never goin ' to fight his way in the front door when the back door 's open . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might think . " " Open or shut what 's it to Morgan ? With five thousand men you go in where it pleasures you and do n't wait for the welcome mat to be put out . " " Five thousand or ten thousand , " said a quiet voice , " I 'm going to stay right here . I 'm going to give Morgan the butt-end of my mind , if nothing else , before he busts over this bridge and into my store , " MITE afternoon wore on . To the funky .11. smell of the river and the lush river growth was added that of sweating men and horses . Horses and men were growing restless . Josh eased Rome 's girth and hoisted his blankets so that a little air could flow under them . Back in the saddle he felt light-headed and detached . Gum had been right about the cherries ; they were n't setting right . He felt kind of sick but happy . He 'd got here , he was all right , he was where he belonged . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it flowed in shallow ripples across a sandbar , then darkened as the channel deepened near the bridge . It was three or four o'clock . The sun went through the water and on to the sandbar , then flashed , pulsing with the movement of the ripples , back into his eyes . He could feel the movement in his temples . He could see the silvery glint of the little minnows , like bullets ; a dragon fly ran its darning needle in-and-out  --  inand-out  --  of the flowing water . It was July . . . a summer afternoon . . . the cool water . the hot sun . . the darting .. . the silver bullets . Josh 's neck stiffened , his head snapped up , his hand closed round the stock of his gun . A horseman was pounding up the road . " It 's one of our scouts , " said Ben Whitey . The rider , a little fellow in uniform on a lathered black , pulled up beside the captain . josh could n't hear what he was saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , his voice quiet but with an edge to it , that let them know that this was it , the time had come . " Boys , " he said , " they 're closing in . They 're up the road a couple of miles . Less of ' em than we figured . I expect them to charge . There 's just two things to remember : first , stand steady . Second , do n't fire till I give the word . " He stood in his stirrups and pounded the words home . " Do n't fire till I give the word . If you fire before you can make your shots good , it 's all over . They 'll ride you down . Hold it . Your guns carry just as far as theirs , and you 're better shots . Those men 've been in the saddle for weeks now , and it 's telling on them . Shoot low so 's MAGAZINE if you miss a man you get a horse . But do n't miss . " The scout went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the black 's hooves ring on the bridge planking , then quiet as he hit the dust of the road on the west bank where the men in hiding were awaiting the news . The captain himself wheeled round to wait the attack with his men . Josh reached for his gun . Waves of something  --  he did n't know what  --  were hitting his chest . " It 's like riding through the woods and being hit by branches that leave thee in the saddle , but so belabored thy chest aches , " he thought . Other waves or perhaps the same ones ? pounded against his ears , broke in deafening crashes as if he were deep under water . Then , in the midst of the pain and crashing , Josh thought , " It 's thy heart beating . Nothing but thy heart . " Gum said , " Fix those lines , boy . " And again , " Get those reins fixed . If your horse jerks his head he 'll spoil your aim . " Josh saw that Gum was right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it along Rome 's neck . " Good boy , " he said . " Good old Rome . Thee 'll be all right . " He knew he was encouraging himself . Rome did n't need cheering . . . he stood solid as a meeting house , only his big head moving up and down a little . They were all waiting . Ben Whitey was cussing , a long line of words as if he was dreaming  --  or singing  --  in a kind of funny way . But they were mostly quiet  --  listening . Something came down , or perhaps it came up , out of the earth itself , something very thin and , fine , like a spun web , and held them all together . Josh could feel it . Anybody could break away from it if he liked , but while they were headed the same way , and awaited the same thing , it held them . You could lean against it like steel . Josh felt its support . . the waves beat against him , but he leaned against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him until he heard the first sounds : a rebel yell from up the road beyond the elder thicket , then another . Josh never knew a man could make a sound like that , It was a screech such as THE BATTLE OF an animal might make , only it was a man 's voice , a voice that could say , " Farewell , " or " Rain tomorrow , " and that made it worse . It sounded crazy .. . it sounded as if the tongue that gave it could lap blood . It broke the web that held them together , it left Josh alone . He could hear far away the thud of hooves , and the waves that had beat against his ears before began now to say words : Rome 's fast . Rome 's mighty fast . Run for it , run for it . The minute they turn the curve , run for it . He looked around , he picked out the likely path . " Sure wish I had a cherry stone to suck on , " said Gum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words drowned out the others . The hoofbeats came nearer . " What 's the worst can happen to thee ? " Josh asked himself . " Get a bullet in thy gizzard . Get killed . Nothing else . " It was all right . He settled down to wait . " Hold it , hold it , " the captain was calling . " Wait for the word . Hold it , hold it . " From around the bend , very slowly , came a single man carrying a white flag . A few paces behind him were perhaps twenty or thirty other mounted men . " It 's a trick , it 's a trick , " the Home Guardsmen were yelling . " Watch it , captain . It 's funny business . " " Do n't shoot , " shouted the colonel , who had ridden up . " Do n't fire on a white flag . But watch ' em . Keep ' em covered . " He rode forward a couple of paces . " Are you surrendering ? " he called . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . No surrender . We want to parley . " " Come on in , " said the colonel . " You , " he yelled . " You with the white flag . The rest of you stay back . " " Trying to get up inside our range and ride us down , " said Gum . The flag-bearer came up alongside the Home Guard colonel and saluted . " Keep your guns on those men , " the colonel called back , then lowered his own . Josh could n't hear his words , but could see that the raider was talking fast and earnestly . " Could be your brother , " said Gum . It was so . The rebel doing the talking was tow-haired and young , a gaunt brown-faced boy , very broad-shouldered and supple in the saddle . Josh 's gun , which had been leveled on him , wavered , but he brought it to bear once again . The Guardsmen grew restless . " Tell him to make up his mind . Surrender and talk  --  or shut his mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Preachin ' ? " " ' Lectioneering for Jeff Davis . " " Shut him up , Colonel . Shut him up . " " We 'll make him talk outa the other corner of his mouth . " " You the one shot old man Yardell ? " The colonel turned his back on the raiders and rode up to his own men . " Do n't take your guns off them , " he told them . " He says we 're surrounded . He says they 've cut around in back of us  --  that they 've got five thousand men circled around Vernon and it 's suicide to resist . He says every bridge and ford can be rushed . He says surrender and save bloodshed . He says if we surrender nobody 'll be harmed . Provisions and fresh mounts taken only . What do you say ? " The storekeeper who had wanted to give Morgan the butt-end of his mind rose now in his stirrups and delivered a piece of it . " He 's lying . Men do n't start talking until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five thousand men they 'd be in Vernon now . Bloodshed , so long 's it 's your blood , ai n't nothin ' to a reb . " " Horses and provisions , eh ? Who appointed us quartermaster corps to the Confederate Army ? " Ben Whitey gave the final answer . He yelled . His yell was n't practiced like the rebel screech ; it had n't the long falsetto midnight quaver which could raise the hackles and slide between the bones like cold steel , but it was very strong and it lifted toward the end with a raw , unsheathed resonance of its own . It seemed what they had waited for , it seemed the only answer to give . It drained away the uncertainty , the distrust , the fear that had accumulated during the long wait . Above the quiet river it rose in great volume and flowed in a roiled and mounting current across the summer fields . Josh 's musket quivered with the violence of his own shouting . The colonel regarded his men quizzically , then shrugged his shoulders as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do with such fire-eaters ? " and rode back to the rebel leader . There was another conference , shorter than the first one , after which the raiders turned , cantered back down the road up which they had just ridden . " They give us two hours , " the colonel said , " to get our women and children out of town . After which , they attack . " A r EIGHT that evening they were still waiting , drawn up , ready . The new moon had set and the night was very dark and warm , filled with soft summer stars which seemed to escape from set star shapes and let light shimmer fluidly  --  and , it almost seemed , moistly  --  across the sky . Some time later the captain with a militiaman by his side came up to the group Josh was in . " Count off here , " he said . " I 'm sending twenty of you men to Finney 's Ford . The rebs could come through there as well as here if they know the crick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use having any if you do n't have enough . " He turned to the militiaman . " Let some of your men sleep , " he said , " but keep a heavy guard posted . " Josh rode with the twenty men slowly and quietly through the night , back across the bridge and to the north side of the river where any party attempting to use the ford could be fired on while in the water . He rode among strangers . Gum and Ben Whitey had been left behind , and he thought , as he had been thinking all day , " Now it begins . " In the darkness the company at the ford seemed very large the men dismounted , speaking in muffled voices , their horses tethered and resting behind them . " The crick takes a turn here , " the new men were told . " Twenty feet down to the bottom here , so keep your eyes peeled . I 'm going to let you men have a couple of hours ' sleep , then you can relieve some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest  --  but do n't rest so hard you ca n't hear a raider crossin ' that branch . " Josh dismounted and felt his way along the bank in the layered darkness . Hefelt rather than saw the stream below him , smelled it really , he believed , though he could hear the occasional lap of a little eddy against a stone , and see here and there a prick of light reflected from a star . He ate some cold biscuit that he had picked up when he left home , gave Rome a biscuit , then stretched out on his blankets , somewhat withdrawn from the main body of the militia and near the bank of the stream . Rome stood behind him snuffing at the scent of the strange men and horses , mouthing the already cropped over grass in search of a neglected tuft . War , Josh thought , seemed a hard thing to come at . The dying and killing he had declared himself ready for at the breakfast table , and which he had imagined he would meet face to face as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seemed always to lurk round another corner . He had fortified himself for so many encounters  --  with either or both  --  that there were now almost no further breastworks he could fling up , or armaments he could assemble . His supply of anticipation was about used up . War appeared to consist not of dramatic and immediate sacrifice , as he had foreseen it at the breakfast table , but of an infinite series of waitings and postponements . This is it , he had said , and it was only Ben Whitey waiting at the cut-off . This is it , and it was Vernon as much like Fourth of July as war . This surely is it , he had said , and it was the wind in the elder clump . This , this a man with a white flag . And now in the dark night to defend the ford  --  and this was not it either  --  but simply lying at ease on his blankets , his cherry addled stomach settled with biscuit , Rome munching by his side , and the milky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under his hand it could be any summer night , lying outside for a time to cool off before bedtime . And if John Morgan himself should bend over him , prod him with his toe and say , " This is it , bub , " he did n't know whether he 'd believe him or not . Getting ready for war might be a short horse and soon curried , but war itself was a horse liable to stretch  --  so far as he could see  --  from July to eternity . . . head at Maple Grove and hocks in Beulah Land . Josh closed his eyes to sleep ; but beneath his lids there flowed not only the remembered sights of the day , the faces , attitudes , gestures he had seen and noted , but the multitudinous sights that there had been in daylight no time to name , or space within the crowded mind to delineate . Now in darkness , behind shut lids , they lived again . He saw the L-shapcd rip in the pants of the raider who had carried the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the controlled drop of a spider  --  delicately spinning , from the spire of an unhlooming head of goldenrod to the yellowed grass beneath it . He heard a voice  --  the storekeeper 's , he thought say , " I 'm a man of peace  --  but there ai n't any peace when your neighbors are being killed . And if its a question of good blood ? or bad  --  on my hands , by God , I choose bad . " At last he slept  --  and continued to see and hear . . . a raider was trying to take his mother 's starling . . . he had ridden his horse inside the summer kitchen , and overturned the table , trampled the crockery and was snatching at Ebony in his cage and Ebony , above the sounds of confusion , was screaming , " Wake up , wake up ! , Josh woke up . He found himself in the center of a great bubbling cauldron of noise : men shouting , screaming advice , cursing ; horses neighing ; and in the creek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ford . There was a spattering of shots . Someone was calling over and over , " Mount , mount , mount . " Josh stepped cautiously , felt for Rome in the dark , said his name , doubled his hands hoping to feel them close upon horseflesh , harkened to the billowing roll of sound . Then suddenly the sound fanned out , burst inside his head , roared against the hones of his skull and , breaking through bone and tissue , trickled out by way of mouth and nose ; it fluttered a few last times against his ear drums , then left him in quiet . WAS daylight before he was sure what 2. had happened : he had gone over the cliff , through the branches of a willow which grew almost parallel with the stream , and now lay within hand 's reachof the creek itself . At first he had tried to call out , but the sound of his own voice had detonated like gunfire inside his head and he was afraid that his skull , which he reckoned was broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-conscious , and wholly sick , but between bouts of retching he thought : " This is it . I 've come to it at last . This is war . It 's falling over a cliff , cracking thy skull , and puking . " It was just after sun-up when Labe found him . He had about given up when be heard sounds from beneath the willow . " Josh , " he cried , " thee 's all right . " " No , I 'm not , " said Josh morosely . " Oh Josh , " Labe said again , and knelt beside him , " thee 's all right . " " I wish thee 'd stop saying that , " Josh told him . " It makes me feel sicker . I 'm not all right . My head 's split , I think . " Labe looked at it . " It does kind of look that way , " he said , " but if thee 's not died yet , I reckon thee 's not going to . " Josh moaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some help ? " Labe asked . " At first , " josh said , " because I did n't know anything . Then when I did , if I even opened my mouth to whisper , my whole head like to fell off . Then I got so 's I could talk , but if I did , I puked . I still do , " he said , and did . " I wish thee 'd go away , " he told Labe finally , " and leave me alone . I was beginning to get a little easy . " He lay still for a time . After awhile he asked , " How 'd thee come to find me ? " " Rome came home without thee . " " I 'd just as lief stay here , " Josh whispered bitterly . " Go to war and fall off a cliff . " " Thee need n't let that fash thee , " Labe said . " More did than did n't . " Then as if he 'd just remembered why he was lying on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , josh asked , " Where 's Morgan ? Did we get him ? " " He did n't come this way . " Josh lifted himself painfully up on one elbow . " Did n't come this way ? " he said . " I heard him . I heard him cross the crick last night . " " That was n't Morgan , " Labe told him . " That was some cottonheaded farmers over'n the south bank who took a freak to drive their stock across to where your company was , to save them from the rebs . " " I was fooled , " said Josh . " I thought it was Morgan . " " Thee had plenty of company . They was all fooled . " " Where 's Morgan now ? " Josh asked . " Dupont , they say . He gave Vernon the go-by . " Josh lay back . The happiness he felt hurt his head so that for a minute he could n't speak . They had stood off Johnny Morgan  --  they had kept him out of Vernon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying at the edge of the crick , he had thought he would hate admitting he 'd been hurt , not by gun or saber , but by falling over a bank onto his head . Now it did n't seem to matter . Yesterday morning and his talk of dying and killing seemed almost a lifetime away ; the past twenty-four hours , a prolonged campaign from which he had emerged a veteran , with mind much cleared as to what mattered and what did not . Next time . . . he would n't talk so big about fighting and dying . But that did n't MAGAZINE matter either , now . What mattered was that he had stood there . . . he had been afraid , but he had stood at the bridge . He had thought of running but he had n't done it . . he had stood in the front line not knowing but that Morgan himself might bear down upon them . . he had stood at the crick 's edge in the darkness and confusion and had been hunting gun and horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned . . talk beforehand is no good . . . in the darkness on a twenty-foot cliff it is best not to hurry . . . death when you move toward it , seems to retreat ; it is only when you turn and run , that it pursues . " Labe , " he whispered , " we stood them off . We saved Vernon . " There was nothing Labe could say to this . Presently he asked , " If I got some help does thee think thee could move , Josh ? They 're worried about thee at home . Pa did n't take off his clothes all night He 's on his way here now . " Josh felt his mouth begin to tremble and put his arm across his face as if to keep the sun out . " If thee 'd help me , " he said , " I think I could . I 'd like to meet pa half way .
