txt American initiative in the Southwest Pacific faced a supreme test today as the Japanese hurled a combined sea and air force into an attempt to regain control of the southeastern Solomon Islands . With first reports indicating that the great battle is going favorably to the United States , it is believed here that the Japanese must win this fight or see the initiative pass firmly into Allied hands . While an American defeat would force the Allies back upon Australia , New Zealand , and New Caledonia and once more expose those spots to a Japanese invasion attempt , an enemy setback would open the way for important Allied advances against the Japanese to the north and the northeast , it is felt . Although the Japanese attack apparently is being made in considerable strength ? at least two aircraft carriers and a battleship being included  --  American ' forces are striking at the foe with a vigor which indicates that reinforcements , particularly aircraft , have reached the Solomons during the past week or so . Counterattack Expected It can be stated on the basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States been expecting a heavy Japanese counterattack , but Washington has been hoping for one as an opportunity to strike a new blow against an enemy whose sea power was mauled badly in the Battles of Macassar Straits , Coral Sea , and Mid-Way . The American Naval Command was deeply disappointed when the enemy flotilla , which made a weak effort to prevent the Marines from landing in the southwest Solomons , turned tail and ran before the American forces could trap and annihilate it . The presence of Flying Fortresses , possibly operating from airports on Guadalcanal Islend , is on element of great strength for the defenders since it enables them to deliver telling blows against enemy warships and transports while the latter are still hundreds of miles from shore . Meanwhile , enemy aircraft apparently are having a rough time of it , since the Navy communiqu ? announces that 21 planes , an exceptionally large number for this part of the world , were lost in what appears to have been a futile attempt to destroy American installations on Guadalcanal Island . Attack From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese attack is coming from the northeast . This would indicate either that the enemy expedition was assembled in the Gilbert Islands or in some of the Japanese-mandated islands to the north , or that it had been assembled at New Britain and had been forced to take the long way around , not daring to run the gantlet of American planes based on both Australia and the Solomons . It is recognized , however , that both speed and efficiency were necessary on the enemy 's part to assemble a major attacking force in such a short time , particularly when distances are so great and his forces were distributed over such a wide area . Since the action started at least two days ago , it is apparent that the Americans were not caught by surprise , as were the Japanese by the American attack upon the Solomons , and that the United States forces have been able to get in telling blows before the enemy even got within sight of land .                 @ @ @ @
