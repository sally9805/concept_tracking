At this season of the year , great quantities of the little Christmas luxuries shipped by the little people of the world used to arrive in New York harbor . <P> <P> Moore-MacCormick ships used to dock with hams from Gdynia , cheese and tinned fish from Norway , fancy breads from Sweden . American Export freighters brought snails from Casablanca , almonds and wines from Marseille , chestnuts and anchovies from Genoa and Naples , figs from Smyrna and Piraeus , Balkan herbs . Along Manhattan 's South and Washington Streets , around 200 brokers large and small were having their Christmas rush , their warehouses full of sugar and spice . <P> In October three or four vessels used to lie off Basra port in the Persian Gulf , waiting for the packers to send out the first full cargoes of dates . Within a few hours of each other they would get away in the annual race for New York . Usually a British Strick and a German Hansa liner vied for the lead ; first one in with his 5,000 tons of dates got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brothers , biggest U.S. date importer ( Dromedary ) , gave a handsome loving cup to the winning captain . <P> Not this year .
