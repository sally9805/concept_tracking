HORSES IN THE SKY JAMES BOYD T HE ex-Cavalry Colonel stood with the other officers at the edge of the pine wood and looked at the blackboard . " This , gentlemen , " a staff major was saying , waving his piece of chalk in one hand and his pointer in the other , " represents the wood where we now stand . This is the small sandy field in front of us with its farther border of pine woods . We will assume . . . " The ex-Cavalry Colonel looked away across the faint pattern of old furrows under the broom straw and the tumbleweed to the dark dense wall of pines and then up to the North Carolina sky . He was tall and slim and the gray hair of his head fitted him like a close furry cap as he held his hat under his arm and stood quiet and straight . He had not wanted to come here to observe a demonstration of air-borne tactics , even though it brought him back to his own state . He had been a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prestige , and though now he had become G2 of a large new impressive cantonment he was without enthusiasm for modern warfare . Why had the ancient profession of arms had to pick his particular lifetime in which to turn mechanical ? Why , of all people , had he been sent to see this show ? Cavalry was what he knew . As the Colonel thought about this the Staff Major continued to talk in a precise , military way . The observers were to assume , it seemed , that the fields were in rear of the enemy lines and near an enemy airfield and subsidiary base . They were to assume that the various elements to be employed represented larger elements ; that , as employed , they were not to be considered as a normal tactical force . There would be a simulated attack on the assumed enemy base . " Assumed , " the Colonel thought , " simulated . " He mastered a yawn. p RESENTLY the Staff Major had van- ished and also the blackboard . Nothing stood between the group of observers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the darkness of the pines beyond and the brightness of the sky and the small round clouds . Overhead , then , a light hum seemed to come and go and soon to fill the sky . The Colonel made out a flight of heavy-shouldered transport planes , group after group , in triangular formation , making long columns in the sky . The drumming rose to bursting as the formation seemed to hang almost motionless ; then came in front of a cloud and was seen to be moving . As the Colonel looked it passed two more clouds ; the leading elements dove down with a wheeling motion , leveled off , and burst into simultaneous bloom . Like blossoms the parachutes showered down in a dense white cloud ; a second cloud followed and a third , all white except for here and there a canopy of red nr blue . The canopies and the swinging dots of men below them sank behind the trees . Through gaps he saw men strike the ground and stumble or run or roll while their luminous chutes tugged at them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dots were free , were running together into the woods and firing , except for one or two who lay still on the ground . Signal Corps men were dragging their wires and strange devices around close to the Colonel 's legs , and soon there was a radio loudspeaker quacking forth another modern young officer 's dry voice . " Gentlemen , " it said , " you have just seen the paratroops go into action on what is marked Drop Zone A on Photographic Aerial Mosaic Map II . Similar attacks , but in less strength , are being made on Drop Zones B and C. The attack which you are witnessing is being made by a brigade plus the following elements : two batteries of paratroop artillery , one company of engineers , one signal company , one medical detachment , one ordnance detachment , one military police detail . . . . " While he spoke they began to hear the faint popping of carbines coming to them on the light breeze . There were mysterious sounds in the loudspeaker and then the young officer 's voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please do not intrude on the edge of the field . Please do not circulate . The glider troops are about to arrive in support . The first tows have cut loose at 2:34 ; they should be here in three and a quarter minutes . " The Cavalry Colonel waited , standing withdrawn . Suddenly a shadow fell on him : enormous . Over his shoulder , brushing the treetops , a great silent shape skimmed down ; its wheels touched in a flurry of sand ; its tail came up like a fighting tarantula and there was a slight hollow rumbling in its belly as it rolled over the broken ground . It lurched to a stop . Instantly , little men  --  Looking little , at least , under the wingspread  --  were running out of it , their helmets strapped down , their wicked-looking carbines in their hands . Behind them there was another shadow , another hollow rumble : another glider pulled up , gently rocking . The scene then lost cohesion . The gliders were coming in from everywhere now , at all angles to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front , behind , right , left ; great glassy-headed dragonflies that ran high-tailed or stopped with grinding brakes . One spewed out a small white parachute from its tail to check its speed ; others , having cast their wheels , came in on their long ski-like skids and coasted down the field in fountains of dust . All the while , more close-helmeted men with carbines were running into the woods . In the middle of this almost silent violence , the Colonel heard the thump of .75 pack-howitzers and saw , across the field , a drift of light blue smoke . Men with long gun barrels and tripods were running out of the holds of the gliders that were slipping in , and soon there was the crack of anti-tank guns . Still the gliders came into the little field . One drew his bead too fine and ripped the tip off his neighbor 's wing . There was a crackle as a small pine was mowed down by another . In the open space still left , still another set down . Two men of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rabbit from its burrow a jeep popped out and scuttled toward the firing in the woods . The Colonel laughed . By now the incoming gliders were crowding the field like a parking lot . Engineers were unloading small bulldozers , and signalmen had broken out a reel of wire and ran it forward toward the firing in the trees . Two last gliders came in and settled , rocking slowly , in the last open space . " Well , well , " thought the Colonel , " this is quite a circus . Quite a show . " cc OITTING ducks . " A hard voice was in his ear . " Duck soup , Colonel . Just when they come in . One machine gun could get a dozen of ' em . " He was a young pilot , a chunky , ruddy , black-haired captain with wrinkled hat and leather jacket , and he was as familiar in his manner to the Cavalry Colonel as he would have been to an Air Force colonel . " Are you an observer , Captain ? " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir . I just flew some of those generals down from Washington . I 'm a pilot . " " And know all the answers , I suppose , " the Colonel said . " Well , sir , " the pilot answered promptly but judicially , " most of the answers in the air . And in the air , those kites are sitting ducks . " The Colonel turned away . He was disposed to watch the maneuvers of these curious people from the sky who by now , among other amenities of warfare , had set up a dressing station and an ordnance repair shop complete with power tools . The ordnance men spun their air compressor a couple of times to show that it worked , then waited disconsolately to be of service . Meanwhile litter-bearers began to appear with simulated casualties . Great was the dressing station 's zest when a white-faced private was brought in with an actual broken leg . The loudspeaker was quacking again . " Attention please , gentlemen . This concludes the afternoon 's tactical performance . Your transportation will arrive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to occupy the vehicle assigned to him . " HAT night after II supper it was dark not totally , but the darkness of a starlight night without a moon . In a long line of jeeps they bumped over old furrows to another field , smaller than the one they had watched that afternoon . Soon after their lights were put out they heard the towplanes overhead and saw their small red lights and the small white lights of the gliders that rode astern . These disappeared and they were left again in the silence and in darkness broken only by two hooded lights in the little field beside them , lights too faint to be seen on the ground at two hundred feet . Gradually they resumed talking until cut off by the loudspeaker 's voice : " No matches , gentlemen ; no cigarettes from now on , and also silence , please . " They searched the sky then , but never saw a sign . At last , however , they heard a faint whisper not far off the ground and then the faint hollow rumbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  no more . But at its end they were conscious that right before them , not thirty feet away , a great shape had come to rest . Another followed shortly , landing close beside it . Then there was quite a pause ; it was only when they heard the bump of a canteen against a carrier door that they realized that a third glider had come in and that the troops were leaving it . Two more followed , much like the first , and the Colonel and the other observers had given up trying to see them , either on the ground or in the sky , when far above they heard celestial music ; at least it was coming from heaven and was faint and high and unearthly . What it actually played , up there in the sky , was " They Cut Down the Old Pine Tree . " A few supposed that it was some trick of radio , but the music kept moving through the heavens and they realized that there was a sixth glider and that in that glider a band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Coming In on a Wing and a Prayer " and the music swung great circles under the stars and finally came to rest in the little field beside the other gliders . For the first time , there was a comment from an observer : " Great day , " a flat Western voice said , " ai n't that Americans for you ? Who else , " it explained plaintively , " would think of a fool thing like that ? " HERE was applause then and the lights I came on and the ten-piece band marched up and so did the glider pilots and the air-borne infantry , and all the visiting officers closed around them and asked them questions . Flight lieutenants and even privates were being closely listened to by persons of rank . The ex-Cavalry Colonel overlooked one circle and cocked an ear . " The lights on the field are infra-red , " a pilot was saying to the ring around him . " And we have infra-red goggles . So we see them for miles up there . No , sir , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; oh , sometimes you kind of think you see it . But what you do , " he said patiently , " is to feel for it with your wheels . " He stopped as though that ended it . " Well , " a general asked , " and then what do you do ? " " Then you come forward with your stick , " the pilot said , " but of course you want to be quick . " There was a thoughtful pause . " Do you mean to say , " the General said , " that you can do this anywhere ? " " Oh yes , " the glider pilot said tonelessly , " wherever we have two lights . On any field . Or by moonlight without lights , " he added . " On any field . " " All right , you 're down , " the General said ; " then what do you do ? " " Unless the CG is to be picked up again , we go into action with the men . " " General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our glider pilots about the most all-round fighting men in the world today . " An Official ringer pointed at the glider pilot . " He is trained to fly powered ships , " said the Voice , " then to fly gliders ; he receives full infantry combat training ; he flies his men to the fighting front and leads them into action when he gets there . " Thus exhibited , the glider pilot hung his head and , seeing that the General was momentarily distracted by the Official Voice , he seized the opportunity to back crabwise out of the circle . The old Cavalry Colonel smiled to himself . Nice boy , he thought . He looked at the men again , at the pilots in their flying helmets , at the infantry in their close steel hats . The faces , impassive , showed up sharp in the beams from the jeep headlights or were half hidden in the shadows between . These were the world 's newest foot soldiers . The newest version of the oldest arm . The paratroopers with their pants tucked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had a right to . But here were men who with no extra pay , no different uniform , had simply been assigned by authority to sail fantastically through the skies . The paratroopers broke legs and sometimes spines , but when these men had trouble it was apt to he final  --  when something happened , as it did now and then , to a glider , there was no way out . Having just arrived , at some risk , out of the void , the men stood around now patiently waiting for orders . The eternal infantry : the sort of men who had formed the Army of Northern Virginia , and also , for that matter , the Army of the Potomac . The Colonel 's heart warmed to these men : he knew them of old and understood them . But mostly , as he stood there , it was cavalry that he was thinking about . He sought out the pilot who had called these air-borne troops duck soup . III it r WAS late and empty in the officers ' mess when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down and rapped on the table . The barman , walking in his sleep , came round the corner , of the bar . The Colonel turned back to the pilot and drew in his long , thin legs . " Sit down , my boy , " he said . The pilot sat down , very upright and chunky , and looked at the Colonel with bright black eyes . The barman was standing muffled in sleep like a cold hen . " What will you take ? " the Colonel said . " Oh , anything , " the pilot said , " anything at all . " " Then , " the Colonel said , " I think we will have some bourbon . " " Sir , " the barman said , " we got nothing but beer . " There was a long silence . " Very well , " the Colonel said quietly , " beer . " He turned to the pilot . " Well , what did you think of it this evening ? " The pilot shot back a half-grin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's been all gags , Colonel . Tonight , trick stuff with hooded lights ; this afternoon , the gliders and the paratroops coming down  --  like Christmas tree ornaments . " " They are not , I am told , " the Colonel said , " so easy to hit as they seem . Like Canada geese . " " Give me an MI , " the pilot said . " And I 'm not even supposed to know how to shoot . " " But from five hundred feet , " the Colonel said , " the carriers come in hedgehopping ; suddenly they jump , the canopies open , and they 're on the ground and out of their harness in seconds . " " Shucks , Colonel , " the pilot said , " I 'd get them . " goose chase . While this army was lost , Hood , who had opposed Sherman , moved up against Schofield in Tennessee and drove him out of Franklin . If he could also defeat Thomas at Nashville he could free all of Kentucky and Tennessee and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grant 's siege of Richmond . It would at the least prolong the war indefinitely and the North was about getting ready to quit . There was talk of a compromise peace . " The Colonel rapped on the table absent-mindedly . " Two bourbons , " he called out . " No ice , plain water . " The barman with his shoulders hunched and his eyes on nothing came out from the bar and halted by the Colonel . " Sir , " he mumbled uneasily , " we got none . We got nothing like that . " " Beer , then , " the Colonel said with restrained exasperation . " So Hood shut Thomas in Nashville just as Grant had shut General Lee up in Richmond and the North waited to see what would happen . So did we . " The Colonel paused . " Well , sir , what did happen ? " the pilot said . " Nothing , " the Colonel said . " Finally , the North could not stand it . They began telling Thomas he must fight . Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his cavalry . " The barman arrived with the two glasses on a Coca-Cola tray . " The North never trusted Thomas , " the Colonel said . " because he was a Virginian . Absurd , of course . " He looked severely at the barman , who stood waiting as patiently as a horse . " Finally , as weeks passed without action , everybody up there lost their nerve . Grant himself started for Nashville with orders relieving Thomas . On the train he got word that the battle had been fought . The Battle of Nashville . " The Colonel dropped two dimes on the barman 's tray . The barman woke up with a start and moved away . " Hood was a good general , " the Colonel said . " I suppose no first-class general has ever taken such a whipping . He went into the fight with 63,000 men and came out with 15,000 . Lost his trains , his guns , everything . He never had an army again . What had happened ? " " Colonel , " the pilot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " Wilson , " the Colonel said . " James H. Wilson . He was Thomas 's cavalry commander and Thomas let him carry out his ideas of how to use cavalry . " Now , Wilson 's first step was this : he got nine thousand cavalry together and kept them together . That was what he and Thomas had been waiting for : to build up that enormous supply of horses . The next step was firepower . He armed the men with Spencer repeating carbines : the newest , fastest-shooting thing . But above all , he taught them to fight on foot . So " ? the Colonel leaned forward ? " the morning the action started , Wilson 's nine thousand cavalry rode round Hood 's left flank  --  and remember the position was thoroughly fortified  --  dismounted and , before Hood could reinforce , rolled it up with an infantry attack . Then " ? the Colonel tapped the table sharply for emphasis ? " they were back on their horses and in pursuit . Every time Hood tried to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rains had not flooded a river or two Hood could have lost every man he had . ? D iD it ever occur to you to ask " ? the Colonel tapped the table again ? " why Sherman 's march should have knocked the whole Confederacy out of the war ? He ran off the stock and burned the crops on a forty-mile strip , then he was gone . Why should doing that paralyze a country as big as Europe ? " " I do n't know , Colonel , " the pilot said . " I 've heard about Sherman , but I never thought much about him . " " No one has thought about him to any purpose , " the Colonel said . " Otherwise they might have wondered why the South 's defense collapsed because Sherman had stolen some Southern ladies ' tableware . The fact is that while Sherman was marauding , the South was being finished by this Wilson . It was Wilson who snuffed out any attempt to reorganize forces in the South . And what , " the Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilot did not answer . He waited , expectantly . " To use the horse as transportation for firepower . " " He was a smart guy , " the pilot said . " It is because you do n't know the past , " the Colonel said , " that you can not see the future . But I see it . This new horse of yours , the plane , follows the tracks of the old horse . First he was used for scouting , then for raiding , and now you boast of your massed charges across the sky . But these people here " ? he waved at the blank window ? " are using your horses to put the fighting men where they are wanted ; and in warfare , to the end of time , the place where the fighting man is wanted is on the ground . That , " the Colonel said , " is where war is decided ; everything else is a preparation for it . " So what you have is a horse that can put the fighting man on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anywhere , faster than ever before . The enemy must guard every open space , every field , every depot and base . And guard them pretty heavily because he will have no time to move troops up after the attack starts . Hood 's infantry could move at two and a half miles an hour , Wilson 's cavalry at five . Only twice as fast . And look what he accomplished . But these sky divisions move at a hundred miles an hour . Forty times as fast . " ! " But what about panzer divisions ? " the pilot said . " Air-borne do n't move forty times as fast as panzers . " " Panzers are always limited in numbers and by roads and terrain , " the Colonel said , " but in any case their best speed is twenty miles an hour . So that even if all the enemy 's troops were motorized , we would still have an advantage of five to one . He will need reserves close to all important forward points in order to meet the threat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " the new horse is here . But whether we know what to do with him depends on two things . On two men rather . We must have a Wilson to forge the tool . And we must have a Thomas in the high command who will let him forge it and let him use it . " The Colonel reached for his glass . " I propose a toast to the James H. Wilson of this war . " " Weil , Colonel , " the pilot said , " I declare I never expected to hear you propose a toast to a Yankee general . " The Colonel looked on the pilot sternly . " General Wilson may not be a Yankee this time , " he said . " Any more than General Thomas was a Yankee last time . "
