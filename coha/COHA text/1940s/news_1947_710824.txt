txt WASHINGTON , Oct. 22 ? Communist infiltratibn is done through the mind , and never openly until the mind has been conditioned by carefully slanted propaganda to receive it in its real character . To accelerate that mental condition in the United States has long been the deliberate effort of a group in Hollywood which*in various ways influences the output of the motion-picture studios . That is what the House Committee on Un - 1. merican Activities is now seeking to establish by plain proofs ( and that is and should be the extent of a valuable public service . The exciked proposals that a Communist party in ' this country shall be outlawed , even though it does not advocate the violent overthrow of pur form of government , and that the industry should be placed under Federal censorship are the products of emotions that will pass . These always appear after such revelations as Hollywood witnesses before the committee are now making of Communist andProCommunist activities . But , though persons in interest and some sincerely alarmed liberals ? as in this instance ? are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bill of Rights , some ? as also in this instance  --  have- just the reverse effect . The dramatic medium is the easiest vehicle with which to convey masked propaganda to the public mind . Interwoven with the skillful and popular entertainment for which American movies have acquired a world-wide audience , implications to generate a public attitude have for years been discernible to those trained to look for them . And the pro-Soviet slant in certain pictures as well as plays , made Welcome in the days when this was United States public policy , has been more difficult to excise because for a time it was deliberately put there . But before it could be boldly inserted , a number of successf'il writers , organized studio workers and some directors were moving as far in that direction as they could . Recalling the lavish financial rewards for their work in a capitalistic industry , stimulated by a capitalist economy , it was always a matter of wonder why these Hollywood perknis had become captivated by the Soviet system . But captivated they were , and anyone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched closely for the " liberal message " they invariably put in their productions if they could , was reasonably certain of their identities . At least one director is Russian-born , which makes his bias more comprehensible , although he appears greatly to enjoy capitalistic luxuries . Some of the writers have visited Moscow , and much was , made of them during the usual tour of carefully selected areas . Others are merely star-gazers by nature , to whom anything called a " people 's revolution " has an irresistible appeal . At any rate , as the testimony before the House committee is developing , they did in concert what they could to propagandize the Soviet system through the movies and to put obstacles in the way of studio products that mirrored the other side of the shield . It is typical , though paradoxical , that some of these Hollywood folk who are now asserting that Congress is threatening the screen 's " freedom of expression " helped in various ways to enable certain radical labor unions to turn that threat into a reality . But these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line . When the administration at Washington was permitting Communists and fellow-travelers to enter marry units of the government , whether through indifference or for another reason , it was thought by some competent observers of the ? Hollywood ' product that the group which the House committee is now investigating were revealing , very definite influence with the producers . Later , when Soviet Russia was the ally of the United States in war , this trend , though it seemed more definite , was condoned as public policy . But now , as proof multiplies that among the fixed Soviet objectives is the downfall of the American system , and what Mr. Baruch calls the " cold war " is raging , this influence becomes part of an open danger . The best way to minimize it is to identify it , and that is what the House committee , apparently to the great satisfaction of many members of the harassed industry , is seeking to do . The prospect is that no revelation will be . fore the committee ill bring any nearer to accomplishment the proposal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States . And the further prospect is that the dramatic form of expression in this country , including that primarily designed for entertainment , will be in no more danger of political censorship after the committee hearings are ended than it was when they started . But those Hollywood producers who have been coerced into putting masked Soviet propaganda on the screen , or who have been beguiled into what they mistakenly thought was a " liberal " policy , will be encouraged to give straight goods to the public . And the actors and other . ' studio-workers who have been badgered and abused for opposing the self-styled liberals will ' have informed public opinion on their side at last . If the Chicago poll quoted at Lake Success yesterday by Senor Cohen of Chile is correct , and 30 per cent of the American people still do n't know what the function of the United Nations is , then obviously the entrances of their minds require protections such as the House committee- , is trying to provide .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
