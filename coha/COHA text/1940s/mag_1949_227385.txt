Fight on , my men . . . <P> A little I mehurt , but yett not slaine ; <P> He but lye downe and bleede awhile , <P> And then He rise and fight againe . <P> - Percy 's Reliques <P> The President , unhorsed in the Senate battle over civil rights , came a cropper again , this time in the fight in the House to overthrow the Taft-Hartley Act . Harried from every side , his congressional forces were trapped between a softened version of the Taft-Hartley Act and the Administration 's moderately toughened version of the Wagner Act . <P> As the debate rolled into its second week , Speaker Sam Rayburn made one last effort to break the impasse . Knowing that the Administration 's bill was a lost cause , he and his aides had cooked up five compromises which they hoped would attract votes . The provisions , with a few minor changes , were lifted from the Taft-Hartley Act itself . The most important of them was the one giving the President authority to use the weapon of injunction in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not think much of such a proposition . But the House strategy was up to Sam , Harry Truman added . Labor leaders also gagged at the idea of accepting the hated injunction . Nevertheless , they quietly passed the word to their friends in Congress to support Sam 's substitute . They were even ready to accept the injunction if they could get rid of most of the Taft-Hartley Act . That is , the majority of them were . John Lewis , who had had to pay through the nose for defying injunctions , was dead set against any compromise at all . <P> Speaker Rayburn had relinquished the chair and was prowling around the House , perching here &; there , nervous and anxious . Minority Leader Joe Martin took the floor to defend the softened version of the Taft-Hartley Act ( the Wood bill ) , which was backed by the Republican-Southern coalition . Then Rayburn 's compromise package was introduced . Sam himself stepped out on the floor . Eloquently , somewhat defensively , he appealed for votes for his measure : " Let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . believe that we would press down upon their brow a crown of thorns . " <P> Veteran Rayburn could tell from the dutiful applause that he had lost . In obedience to John Lewis ' orders , some Democrats from Lewis ' coal-mining districts slid over to the Republican side ; Sam 's proposition went down by a 211-to-183 vote . Then the House took a roll-call vote on the Wood bill . The coalition measure won its preliminary test by 217 to 203 . <P> Help from the South . It might have been all over then &; there if New York City 's Vito Marcantonio had not popped up with a demand that a final , printed version of the bill be read . The maneuver put off the final vote until next day . <P> That night Rayburn &; aides went to work on Southern Democrats , pleading for votes against the Wood bill so that the **25;11260;TOOLONG House Labor Committee would at least have a chance to frame a new law . They pointed out that passage of the Wood bill would be a complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next day , ten who had voted for the Wood bill somersaulted and voted against it . It was breathtakingly close . Down went the Wood bill by a hairline vote of 212 to 209.
