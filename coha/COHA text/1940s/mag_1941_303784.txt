The sudden fact of war caught Hollywood with its make-up off . Before the first blackout of Los Angeles , the citadel of cinemadom camouflaged its feelings with a vigorous regurgitation of gags . The blackout somehow changed things ; everybody wanted to do something to help . <P> Some results : <P> &gt; Studios were besieged with requests from top executives , $50-a-week writers , et al , for contract releases permitting them to enlist or enroll as civilian volunteers . <P> &gt; Beating the rest of the movie colony to the punch , Actors Gary Grant and Edward G. Robinson each forked out $100,0000 for war charities . <P> &gt; Paramount pressagents put out the story that one of their up- &-coming; stock girls , Manhattan Model Blanche Grady , had formed a club : The Knit Wits . <P> &gt; Flamboyant Victor McLaglen galloped his gaudy light-horse troop to a Los Angeles jail to sign up for something . <P> &gt; Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was faced with a title change for its forthcoming musical , I 'll Take Manila . <P> &gt; 20th Century-Fox stopped production on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instant production . <P> &gt; Studios abandoned outdoor night shots , went on a rigid 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. shooting schedule to get people home before blackout time . <P> &gt; Republic , home of the Western picture , began rewriting Westerns in production to eliminate all possible-gunfire . Reason : civilian authorities wanted the studio 's Wild West arsenal . Future Westerns will be made with prop armament . <P> &gt; A U.S. Army searchlight battery set up living quarters in the animation building of Walt Disney 's studio ( adjoining the Lockheed Aircraft plant ) , flirted with pretty girls from the inking &; painting division at lunchtime . <P> &gt; While Hollywood parents pondered shipping youngsters &; oldsters to the interior , a wag volunteered : " I understand they 're starting a California Society in Iowa . " <P> &gt; The Hollywood Reporter , trade organ , turned up with a Page 1 item : " First American victory over Japanese was won by the Paramount baseball team Sunday when it defeated the LA Nippons , all-Jap team , 6-to-3 . No one was aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men allowed the game to finish ... then rounded up Jap contingent ... "
