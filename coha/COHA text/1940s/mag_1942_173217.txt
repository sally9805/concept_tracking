On one corner Demetrios P. Diakandru ran the 79th Street Restaurant . On the other Tom Petropulos ran the Old Transfer Restaurant . <P> For 22 years each stared across the street at his rival 's window signs , his rival 's customers , the cash-register figures . Finally they decided they hated each other . On the sly , cunning Mr. Petropulos leased Mr. Diakandru 's building . On the quiet , crafty Mr. Diakandru bought Mr. Petropulos ' building . Grinning slyly , Mr. Petropulos served an eviction notice . Grinning right back , Mr. Diakandru gave his foe an eviction notice , too . <P> The case went to Cleveland Municipal Court nine times , to the Court of Appeals five times , even got to the Ohio Supreme Court . Last week the rivals emerged with a draw . Thereupon Mr. Petropulos promptly evicted Mr. Diakandru . In jig-time , Mr. Diakandru evicted Mr. Petropulos . All afternoon they trudged heavily across the street , toting pots &; pans , stoves , stools , counters , ice cream , beer bottles . Suddenly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all off ; the rivals must move right back into their own cafs . <P> Across the street again , to status quo , went the pots &; pans , the stoves and the beer . Said dizzy Mr. Diakandru : " What happened you would n't have expected . This is awful . . . . " For once , Mr. Petropulos was silent . He could n't think of a thing to do .
