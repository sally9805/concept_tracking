The eyes of Canada were on Ontario 's clamorous Legislature . The government seemed headed for defeat . If that happened , there would be a provincial election-of national importance . <P> Finally , every legislator had said his say on a CCF motion criticizing the Tory administration . Then up rose big , slick Premier George Alexander Drew . Said he : he would accept an adverse vote on the motion as evidence of lack of confidence . It took just two minutes for him to get his answer : no confidence-51-to-36 . <P> Despite appearances , George Drew 's government did not really fall ; it was pushed . In power 19 months , its 37 members had managed to control the 90-seat House by grace of the Legislature 's 16 Liberals . Then bumptious Liberal Leader Mitchell Frederick Hepburn had upset the applecart by teaming with teacherish Edward Bigelow ( " Ted " ) Jolliffe and his 32 socialist CCFers . <P> The Tory defeat , strangely enough , was annoying instead of pleasing to Ted Jolliffe . His party had just been shellacked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 ) ; the CCF wanted no election now . Mitch Hepburn , who engineered the business , could grin at the defeat of one rival and the discomfiture of another , but there was little chance of the Liberals picking up many new seats . The man who beamed was George Drew . Now he could go to the people , contend that his opponents had sabotaged him , ask for a clear majority . <P> Outside the province , Ontario 's upsy-daisy was important because the election it necessitates-probably to be held in May or early June-will be a straw-in-the-wind prelude to the Dominion-wide election due this summer . Certainly all parties will shoot the works in Ontario , aware that provincial victory will boost national chances .
