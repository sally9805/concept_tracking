ONE of the weapons most frequently employed in Wendell Willkie 's somewhat inadequate rhetorical arsenal is his assertion that , under the New Deal , the economic system of this country has been brought to a state of collapse . In recent speeches he has declared : The New Deal tactics have made it impossible for business to expand. ? Minneapolis , October 19 . The key to war as well as the key to peace is American production . . . . Our agencies of production were abused , attacked , smothered under a wave of political propaganda. ? St. Louis , October 17 . No Administration in the history of America has ever understood less about the problems and necessity of production than this one. ? St. Louis , October 17 . The Republican candidate 's devotion to this theme is not very flattering to his audiences . It suggests that they never bother to read the newspapers or to inform themselves about the business situation . Yet after learning from the headlines on page one that Willkie says the New Deal has ruined industry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read about rapidly expanding production and steeply rising profits . The Federal Reserve Board Index of Production , we find , stood at 125 in September , or 131/2 per cent above the 1929 average . The automobile industry has scheduled a record output for October and now expects actual achievement to exceed the estimate . The profits of 400 leading corporations , according to a compilation made by the National City Bank , were 58.6 per cent greater in the first six months of this year than in the first half of 1939 , representing an annual rate of return of 10 9 per cent as compared with one of 7 per cent . Are these the marks of economic decadence ? As C. F. Hughes , the well-known financial writer , says in the New York Times , " Dreams of business ' flat on its back ' must come from smoking campaign cigars , or else the speakers are talking about some other country . " When Mr. Willkie paints his highly imaginative pictures of the state of the nation under the New Deal , we sometimes wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1932 . He never refers to that last dreadful year of Republican government , and we do n't blame him if he wants to forget it But we may be sure that most of the voters have longer memories . They may , with reason , feel that the WPA is an inadequate solution for unemployment , but they wo n't forget that in 1931 and 1932 the one expanding industry was apple-selling . During those last two years of Republican rule industry really was down and out . Let us , look at the record . In 1932 the physical volume of industrial production , as measured by the Federal Reserve Board index , was The NATION 58 . After the election of Mr. Roosevelt it rose every year except in 1938 , when it dropped to 88 . Last year it was 108 , and the average for the first six months of 1940 is 115 . In 1932 national income dropped to $40 , - 089 million ; in 1939 it was $69,400 million . For the current year the Nation 's Business estimates that it will exceed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its purchasing power will be greater than that of the record national income of 1929 . It is also worth recalling that since Mr. Roosevelt first took office , farm income has almost doubled . In 1932 hogs brought from $2.75 to $4 per hundred pounds ; in 1940 prices have ranged between $4.90 and $6.40 . Corn at one time in 1932 was as low as 29 cents a bushel ; today it is around 60 cents . Wheat averaged 42 cents in 1932 ; now , despite the loss of foreign markets due to the war and other causes beyond the government 's control , it is around 85 cents . Of course , Mr. Willkie may claim that it is unfair to compare conditions in the worst Republican year with those in the best Roosevelt year , when industry is receiving an artificial stimulus from the defense program . Let us then contrast the seven complete years of the New Deal-1933 to 1939 inclusive  --  with the last seven years of Republicanism , the years 1926 to 1932 , which saw the Coolidge boom as well as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of industrial production averaged 89 ; for the seven Roosevelt years it averaged 92 ( Federal Reserve Index . Average of 1935-39 equals 100 ) . This refutes completely the assiduously circulated suggestion that after seven fat Republican years the country has suffered seven lean years under the New Deal . We note also that while Mr. Roosevelt has been grinding business into the dust , commercial failures , as recorded by the Department of Commerce , have averaged 1,042 monthly . In the glorious Coolidge-Hoover days the monthly average was 1,784 . Since the vast majority of business units in this country are small in size , these figures are obviously a reflection of the state of health of small business . As such they make a very illuminating comment on Mr. Willkie 's contention that it is the little man who has been particularly injured by the New Deal . It should be clear enough by now , however , that both Mr. Willkie and his fellow-representatives of big business have attempted to sell the country a fraudulent bill of goods on the economic consequences of the New Deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate ought to have some statistical information , has shown a consistent record of expansion during the years when Mr. Roosevelt has supposedly been killing it . In 1932 its average monthly output was 6,865 million kilowatt hours ; in 1939 this had risen to 10,857 millions . Monthly output for the seven years October 26 , 1940 ending 1932 averaged 7,182 millions ; for the seven years ending 1939 , 8,987 millions . If this be the kind of ruin the New Deal has brought on the country , we shall not be surprised if on November 5 the electorate chooses another helping of the same in preference to Mr. Willkie 's warmed-over version of the famous Hoover chicken . An Unappreciated Orator C OLONEL PHILIP B. FLEMING , in his administration of the Fair Labor Standards Act , has tried to win the good-will of both capital and labor . He has sought to please labor by his speeches and capital by his rulings . The speeches have eloquently resisted , the rulings have effectively furthered , the campaign to weaken the wage-hour law . " Do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last July , " it will be time enough to talk about longer hours after industry has absorbed the unemployed ? " " It used to be fashionable in cynical circles , " he asserted in an address last September , " to say that , of course , when we get bang up against the problem of girding the nation for defense , social legislation would all go up the chimney . . . . That talk is just nonsense . It is based on the false premise that our social and labor laws are mere candy sticks to keep the nation 's workers from whimpering . " " The necessity of preserving social gains , " he explained to a business men 's convention on October 10 , is " not merely for humanitarian reasons but actually in the interest of maximum production . " Were Colonel Fleming 's duties confined to oratory , he would be one of labor 's heroes . When Colonel Fleming took over enforcement of the wage-hour law , it was rumored that it would be his task to do by interpretation what Congressional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendment . Earlier this year , to an American Newspaper Guild delegation protesting against proposed regulations affecting white-collar workers , Colonel Fleming denied he had any such intentions . The proposed regulations , to which the Newspaper Guild objected , have now been promulgated . They are but the latest of the steps Colonel Fleming has taken to weaken the act . He has redefined executive , administrative , and professional employees and outside salesmen in such a way as to bar several hundred thousand more workers from overtime pay . A man making as little as $30 a week may now be an " executive . " Almost any white-collar worker may be regarded as an " administrative " employee . Newspapermen become " professional , " an honor for which they must pay , for executives and persons in the second and third categories making more than $200 a month are exempt from the overtime provisions of the act . Colonel Fleming ingenuously explained that he made these new381 regulations because he did not think Congress intended the act to cover people like Hollywood stars or big business executives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David Sarnoff to the police reporter making $50 a week . The labor movement , though it may be united on little else , is agreed on Colonel Fleming . The October issue of the Federattonist , organ of the A. F. of L. , criticizes his administration of the wage-hour law . Labor , organ of the Railroad Brotherhoods , regards him with suspicion . The C. I. 0 . News charges that his division has been hasty and inefficient in investigating wage-hour complaints made by the United Shoe Workers and the Amalgamated Clothing Workers . Labor 's Non-Partisan League has launched a campaign against him . Attacks have been made upon his record by two of labor 's best friends in the House , Coffee on October 7 and Connery on October 14 . Two facts cited by the former make it easy to understand labor 's alarm . More than a year ago the joint pressure of the A. F. of L , , the C. I. 0. , and the Brotherhoods obtained a $2,000,000 deficiency appropriation for the Wage-Hour Division at a time when anti-labor forces had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its funds . On July 1 , although the division is appallingly undermanned , Colonel Fleming returned an unexpended balance of $387,000 to the Treasury , enough to pay for 180 additional inspectors a year . Representative Coffee also called attention to the novel procedure followed by the Wage-Hour Division in handling complaints . The employer is asked to fill out a form on which he states whether or not he is violating the law . In at least one case the acting regional director for New England declined to act upon a complaint because " the employers state they have not violated the law " Labor regards this introduction of the honor system into employer-employee relations as premature . Morale Is Not Enough J UST because Britain continues to ward off invasion and because its morale is standing up magnificently under continuous air attacks , we should not give way to easy optimism . Winston Churchill said in the House of Commons recently that Britain is fighting primarily to survive , and that is the stark truth . What he did not say is that the chances of survival are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , would admit for an instant that there is a danger of ultimate defeat , and their unshakable belief in final victory is one of their greatest sources of strength . Yet however important the moral factor may be , we must not forget that material factors remain decisive Hence we must not be easily content with the economic aid we are now making accessible to Britain but must exert ourselves to multiply it . Whether or not Germany launches a winter campaign 382 against British positions in the Near East , we can be sure that the Nazi General Staff is making careful preparations for an offensive next spring which will be backed not only by the reserves of the Reich itself but by those of all the conquered countries of Europe . Economically these reserves are far more important than is generally recognized . Under the armistice terms France alone must pay a daily levy of 20 million marks and pay at an artificial exchange rate of 20 francs to one mark , which makes the mark almost equal to 50 cents . This adds up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars , to $300 million a month . For many months the Nazis have been draining France to that tune , draining it of food , raw materials , finished goods , and even of machinery . It is interesting to compare this sum with American exports of war materials to Britain , which during the first eight months of this year have averaged under $50 million a month . And in the first year of the war our exports of all kinds to all British countries were at a rate of little over $200 million a month . It has been estimated by Standard Statistics that in the present fiscal year the total outlay of the United States for defense purposes will aggregate $41/2 billion , or $375 million a month . In other words , our efforts to achieve military preparedness , considerable as they are , will only add up to $75 million more per month than Hitler is extracting from conquered France . And if the economic proceeds of pressure on Poland , Denmark , Norway , Holland , and Belgium are taken into account , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , when added to its internal production , make available a war potential far outweighing anything we are yet ready even to contemplate . The extent to which Germany is , in fact , mobilizing the economies of the countries it has overrun may be judged from a recent article in the Deutsche Volkswirt sternly warning the defeated peoples to cooperate actively with their conquerors or face the consequences . When the propertied classes in these countries tit says draw up an honest balance sheet , they will realize that if they wish to salvage anything they must employ their remaining assets instead of guarding them carefully . . . . That means , above all , that they must endeavor day and night to incorporate their regional economy into the given conditions of the new Europe . . . . Above and beyond this the German authorities must expect that they will receive all and any support required to end this war as rapidly as possible . There is , of course , a limit to the amount that the Nazis can squeeze out of their victims . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only take current production , and owing to disorganization of transport , shortage of raw materials , and lack of fuel , that is bound to remain at a low level . Indeed , it seems impossible that France , for instance , will be The NATION physically capable of paying the ' required levy in the form of goods for many months longer . But even so , the loot which Germany has been able to collect has enabled it to recoup its economic strength and will probably leave it with a wide margin over Britain when the spring comes . In view of these facts , we must ask ourselves whether the scale both of our own defense preparations and of our assistance to Britain is at all adequate . When Hitler gets ready to undertake a final offensive against the British Isles he will have available , despite the blockade , an accumulation of the materials of destruction such as no army in history has ever before commanded . Hence , if his attack is to be hurled back and a counter-offensive undertaken , an even greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies . The deciding factor in the war will almost certainly be economic . Potentially the democracies are superior in this field to the dictators , but they have still to learn how to mobilize fully their productive capacities .
