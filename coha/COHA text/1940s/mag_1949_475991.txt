IF YOU are near a river this summer , look sharp . Unless you are careful , the Corps of Engineers or the Bureau of Reclamation , in their zeal to commit a dam or a levee , are likely to run you down . The two agencies are working a little frenziedly these days , because their continued independent existence is threatened . The threat comes from Herbert Hoover 's Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government , which has recommended that the Corps and the Bureau be combined into a single , integrated Water Development and Use Service in the Department of the Interior . This is notably a threat to the Department of the Army 's brassbound baby , the Corps of Engineers , which considers itself immune to reorganization or even to orders from the President of the United States , who is presumably its boss . The Corps of Engineers will do everything in its power and the power of its numerous friends to see that the reorganization plan iskilled , and the Hoover Commission was well aware that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the civil functions of the Corps of Engineers to another agency is found in the intense opposition with which any such proposal is Tikely to be met , " it said . And even before the recommendations were made public , the Corps of Engineers was lobbying against reorganization in a campaign so flagrant that Mr. Hoover himself denounced it . In the severe criticism leveled by the Commission , both the Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation came off badly . But the Commission , after an elaborate investigation , was especially unable to justify the activity of the Army Engineers in the field of navigation , power generation , and flood control . Here the Engineers ' presence is an anomaly ? expensive , dangerous to our water resources , and rich with administrative con fusion . If the Hoover Commission 's recommendations for the administration of the country 's water resources are ignored , the consequences will he costly and tragic . At present , the nation is faced with the paradox of two powerful agencies spending enormous sums of money without a basic plan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the President and his executive office . In its forty-seven years of existence , the Bureau of . Reclamation has spent $1,530,000,000 . In the same period the Corps of Engineers has spent over $5,000,000 , 000 , and it will spend $3,200,000,000 more to complete projects now under way . By any standard , this is a considerable water bill , even for a country as prosperous as the United States . And , in a sense , it is only a beginning . The Bureau and the Corps and other agencies concerned with the country 's water resources have spent , or will spend within the predictable future , $40,000,000 , 000 . The issue is not whether the money should have been spent , but whether it has been spent well ? and whether the amount still to be spent is to be paid out wisely or squandered on a variety of high-cost , pork-barrel works for which the nation pays and from which , in some cases , only a few individuals benefit . The Corps of Engineers was the object of the Hoover Commission 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gance , and independence is perhaps unequaled in the history of an executive division . Almost without exception , the Corps has disregarded the orders of its Presidents . It has set itself above its commander-in-chief . It calls itself " the consulting engineer to and contractor for " the Congress , and it considers itself on arm of the legislative branch . Franklin D. Roosevelt , generally regarded as a strong President , lost every round he fought with the Corps . Although The Champ swung angrily and often , he never laid a glove on the Army Engineers . The reason is clear : the old Rivers and Harbors bills and the current Army Civil Functions appropriations bills are the juiciest pork available to hungry congressmen . Last May , when Senator Paul H. Douglas of Illinois merely intimated this fact , he was angrily attacked for playing politics with something sacred.1-1E , Corps of Engineers has a long ano glorious history . It was organized in 1779 by the Continental Congress , disbanded , and then reconstituted in 1802 when West Point was established as the country 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in fact , a good engineer was almost by definition an army officer . Until 1866 the Corps itself ran the Military Academy and was thought to be the elite of the military service . The tradition that the Engineers get the top-ranking members of a West Point graduating class ? who can choose their own branch of service ? still counted for something as late as the recent war . The Corps had continued to attract top-ranking officers because it continued to offer the most active and interesting career in peacetime . Within the Army it is unique in this respect , for since 1820 it has increasingly involved itself in internal improvements in the national geography ? primarily navigation work on rivers and harbors . It was these " civilian " activities of the Corps with which the Hoover Commission concerned itself . And there is no purely military question involved , any more than criticism of the Corps today should imply disregard for the past achievements of its combat battalions , who put more bridges across the Rhine in fifteen days than had ever been there before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the condition of American rivers is a matter of military consequence , - and so it is . But so also is the condition of the nation 's roads and railroads , and under the same argument the Engineers could take them over tomorrow . It might be preferable , in fact , to have the Engineers run the railroads rather than the rivers ; for a river consists of water , and many more persons are interested in water than the engineers who deepen and dam it . Water , besides being a national resource and the property of the people , is a mobile commodity that can be used for more than one purpose . The same river can provide irrigation , supply a constant flow for navigation , cause floods , generate electrical energy , provide a habitat For fish and wildlife , and at the same time absorb the pollution of factories and mines . The idea of multiple-purpose development of the rivers , to use the water in as many ways as possible , began to get under way in the 1920 's , and it soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government . In 1902 , the Bureau of Reclamation had been established to promote irrigation in the semi-arid states west of the 98th meridian . Since then it had grown and flourished , and by the time the principle of multiple-purpose development was put into general law the Bureau and the Corps were both into the rivers up to their necks . The Flood Control Act of 1936 stated the intention of Congress to authorize multiple-purpose river developments over the entire nation , wherever flood control was one purpose involved . This confused and confusing piece of legislation made flood protection , in addition to navigation , a function of the Corps of Engineers . Irrigation was retained by the Bureau of Reclamation . Furthermore , the Department of Agriculture was charged with protecting against floods by retarding the run-off into the upper reaches of streams , and the Federal Power Commission 's function of surveying river basins for hydroelectric potential was re-emphasized . Said the Hoover Commission of this law : As the Corps ' original responsibility for navigational improvements was expanded to cover flood control and other purposes incidental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility for irrigation was expanded to include other potential by-products of irrigation , the one agency working upstream met the other coming down . Now we are witnessing the spectacle of both agencies contending for the authorization , construction , and operation of projects in the same river basins , for example , in the Central Valley , Columbia , and Missouri Basins . Competition over the same river leads to costly duplication of effort . In California 's Central Valley , both the Army Engineers and the Bureau have simultaneously made sur : veys and plans for a dozen streams . Each agency spent approximately $250,000 on studies for the Hell 's Canyon Project in Idaho . Both the Bureau and the Corps have surveyed and re-surveyed the streams of the Columbia Basin and the Missouri Basin . The physical confusion resulting from the warring agencies ' presence on the same rivers is compounded by the fact that they work under different laws that stem from different philosophies . Reclamation law provides forthe repayment by the water-users of a large part of the government investment ; it prohibits speculation on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single user can take from a public project ; it specifies that publicly generated power shall be sold at the lowest practical price , with preference to public agencies . Just how well Reclamation projects have paid out is controversial . Almost from the beginning , the time allowed for repayment has been repeatedly extended . Now most projects are on a forty-year repayment sched-ule . But some new projects will cost so much repayment period the Corps operates safeguards for the public 's funds . In many cases , local groups benefiting from Army navigation and flood control pay nothing for their benefits . The Corps has been slow enough to recognize the necessity for generating cheap power , but even when power has been generated , the Corps has persistently advocated sale of the power at the source , where only the large private utilities can purchase it . Whereas the Bureau maintains at least partial control over government structures , the Army turns many of its facilities over to local administration . II I N ADDITION to these giant water boys . the Department of Agriculture , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Public Health Service , and a dozen other administrative units have an interest in the rivers and their uses . With so many fingers in the water , it is stirred and muddy to behold . Normally , differences between executive agencies can be co-ordinated , compromised , or eliminated in the President 's office . This has not been possible with the water agencies , principally because of the arrogance of the Corps of Engineers . The Engineers have torpedoed every effort at coordination . The Hoover Commission re-ported : There is simply no escaping the fact that so long as the present overlapping of functions exists with respect to the Corps of Engineers , the Bureau of Reclamation , and the Federal Power Commission , costly duplication , confusion , and competition are bound to result . It has been demonstrated time and again that neither by voluntary co-operation nor by executve co-ordination can the major conflicts be ironed out . The seven-year fight over Pine Flat Darn on the Kings River in California is a case in point . Funds for this clam , which President Roosevelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both by the Bureau ? which was already committed to the basin-wide Central Valley Project ? and the Corps . The trouble started straight away when local authorities asked both the Corps and the Bureau to study their needs . This is a common gambit ? two surveys and two estimates , to allow the local moguls to choose the better deal . Roosevelt ordered that both reports be kept confidential until they could be reconciled by the National Resources Planning Board . The Army 's report , however , was sent directly to the President . by-passing the NRPB ; and , through a clerical error , it was dispatched directly to Congress by the White House . Subsequently the NRPB sent the Bureau report to Congress . The physical plans were almost identical . Emphasis on function , however , differed . The Bureau of Reclamation contended that irrigation benefits would total $1,255,000 annually ; flood control , $1,185,000 : and power , $683 , 000 . The Corps found that irrigation benefits amounted to only $995,000 and flood control , $1,185.000 ; it planned no power installation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the dominant function ; in the Bureau 's eyes , however , Pine Flat was an irrigation project . Later there was a significant change in the Corps ' figures . President Roosevelt , in a series of letters to the Secretary of War , to Congressional committee heads , and to the Secretary of the Interior , made it clear that his Administration considered the work an irrigation project . He wanted it constructed by the Bureau . But the Corps continued to submit the project to Congress as a flood-control project , one of its own civil functions . This bickering and insubordination to the President went on throughout the war . Finally , the President dispatched a blunt note to Secretary of War Stimson : Memorandum for The Secretary of War I want the Kings and Kern River Projects to be built by the Bureau of Reclamation and not by the Army Engineers . I also want the power generated at the projects built by the Army Engineers to be disposed of by the Secretary of Interior . I hope you will see that the Rivers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these . F.D.R. It was a strong note . And it had no effect whatsoever on the Corps . The Army Engineers forwarded the memorandum to Congress , in a routine way , but they did not mention either it or the President 's position when Congress subsequently asked them to testify . The Kings River Project is now under construction by the Corps of Engineers ? an isolated unit in the Central Valley Project which is designed as an integrated basin program of prime importance to California . Incidentally , in the Army plan , no power will be generated . Meanwhile , after the project was under way , a new estimate of benefits was produced . This time the Corps showed benefits from irrigation of $3,382,000 and from flood control , $2,126,000 . In other words , the Army 's own figures showed the project to be predominantly an irrigation project ? which should have been built by the Bureau of Reclamation in the first place . Further , local contributions are lower than they would be under Bureau administration , and the country as a whole ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precedent may have been set in the Central Valley , where the Army seeks authorization for many other works that are in conflict with the Bureau 's basin plan . T HE President 's policy of having the irrigation water and power produced at Army dams distributed by the Secretary of the interior was subsequently adopted by Congress . The Corps has been in public opposition to these provisions , however , and has sought their repeal . From the start , the Corps of Engineers gunned for the National Resources Planning Board set up by Roosevelt in 1934 with instructions to prepare a report on the nation 's water resources . The Corps took part in the work of the Board 's water committee but refused to approve its report . " I am not prepared to approve it in its entirety nor to discuss in detail at this time some of the items which appear to me to be of questionable merit , " the Secretary of War said . The Corps kept the NRPB under constant attack , and when President Roosevelt sought to make the Board permanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Secretary of War ? the only cabinet member who failed to support Roosevelt 's views in this matter before Congress . In 1941 the NRPB made a final attempt to develop a national water policy . Once again the Corps was un-co-operative , and the Chief of Engineers refused to sign the final report . The report has been made in a worthy cause , " he wrote , " and the necessity of withholding my concurrence is regretted . " When the NRPB was killed in 1943 ( with the Corps ' blessing ) , the President 's Bureau of the Budget , central co-ordinating agency of the executive office , proposed to take over certain resource co-ordination functions . This move was blocked when the Corps set up its own Inter-Agency River Basin Committee . This committee has no status , no money , and no staff ; it has solved no inter-agency dispute . But its creation convinced Congress there was no need for the new Budget Bureau activity . Today the Bureau of the Budget attempts to co-ordinate public works activities in the entire federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O NE of the Corps ' coolest and most sensational floutings of Presidential decree may yet cost the country several billion dollars . In 1941 , President Roosevelt ordered all construction agencies to submit their reports to the executive office for clearance . There they were to be reviewed by the NRPB , and later by the Bureau of the Budget . From January 1941 through August 1948 , the Corps submitted 426 reports . Of these , 360 were cleared ; 44 were held not in accord with the President 's program ; 32 were held up because special circumstances made them unacceptable . Once again , the Corps was unruffled ; it submitted the 76 unapproved reports to Congress without change and with the recommendation that they he authorized for construction . These 76 projects included thelargest and most important river developments in the nation . The total cost for these 76 projects ? which the President 's office found unacceptable because of , in many cases , insufficient study ? is estimated at $2,500,000,000 . Many of the projects , the President 's office said , were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were worth . Nevertheless , they were submitted to Congress ? and 62 of them were authorized . The projects include $200,000,000 for bank stabilization and for a twelve-foot channel in the Mississippi ? which has serious repercussions for the Missouri and Ohio Rivers ? $42,000,000 for the Red River ; $10,300,000 for flood control in Illinois ; $120,000,000 worth of multiple-purpose dams in the Central Valley , which have caused serious conflict with the Bureau of Reclamation projects . How do they get away with it ? The answer is simple . Congress loves the Corps of Engineers and the Corps loves Congress . The Corps has the whole-hearted support of the so-called " Rivers and Harbors Bloc , " led largely by men from the lower Mississippi area . These men , given permanent seating by our Democracy , have high seniority on the committees dealing with navigation and flood control on the Father of Waters . One of them , Senator John J. McClellan , was a member of the Hoover Commission and entered an impassioned minority defense of the Corps . Staunchly behind the Rivers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an organization dedicated to the principle that no stream is too small for a federal handout , no levee tall enough , no channel deep enough , no harbor improved enough . It is a comprehensive lobby group , an involuted sort of affair which includes among its membership representatives and senators ? the lobbied ? as well as the contractors , and state and local officials ? the lobby . At the top , of course , are the officers of the Corps of Engineers , who are ex-officio members of the Rivers and Harbors Congress . The president today is Senator John J. McClellan , the very same . Relations among the congress and the Congress and the Corps are very cozy . Regularly the congress resolves in favor of the Corps of Engineers . " We reaffirm our faith and confidence in the Corps of Engineers , whose devotion to this nation and loyalty to the Chief Executive have made possible the orderly and efficient development of the greatest waterway and flood control projects on earth , " said a recent resolution . " I feel that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Engineer . III MAJOR weakness in the Corps ' position in light of national policy but not from the point of view of local beneficiaries ? is its failure to collect enough return from the largesse it bestows . The federal government bears the entire cost of most flood control structures ? the long miles of levees on the Mississippi and the new concrete dams everywhere . The federal government generally bears the entire cost of navigation works as well ? with the proviso that local interests pay nominal right-of-way , terminal , and dock costs . And the federal government , as represented by the Corps , is liberal . Before 1935 , the Corps had developed and maintained an outer harbor at Buffalo , New York . Costs for an inner harbor had been borne by the city . But in 1935 the city asked the Corps to take over maintenance of the inner harbor simply because the city said it was short of cash ; it did not want to pay if it did not have to . The district engineer , the man representing the Corps on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Engineers , however , recommended that the federal government pay half the costs of the inner harbor , thereby relieving the city of this burden . Congress voted this proposal into law . In a single bill , seventeen projects which the executive office of the President declared did not have a high enough degree of local participation were , nevertheless , passed on to Congress ? which , on the recommendation of the Corps of Engineers , obligingly approved . Among these seventeen was a $322,000 channel project from Boston Harbor to Commercial Point . Although the district engineer declared that oil interests on Commercial Point should pay $100,000 toward the cost , the Chief of Engineers said that no local contribution was necessary . Another project which was disapproved by the President but passed by Congress was a $160,000 Tacoma Harbor project . The NRPB found that bencfits would go largely to two lumber companies . It was found also that timber resources in the area were nearing exhaustion ? which would end the usefulness of the project anyway . Congress , however , approved the Corps recommendation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? is the improvement of the Warrior-Tombigbee river system to permit barges traveling downstream on the Mississippi to return upstream via the Mobile , Warrior-Tombigbee , and Tennessee Rivers to the Ohio . This proposed route would have the advantage of being a slack-water route , while the Mississippi River improvements have so increased the speed of its current that upstream travel is difficult and expensive . The project was rejected by Congress in 1944 , but it was resurveyed and reintroduced . The cost was estimated at $117,000,000 plus an annual maintenance charge of $811,000 . However , said the Engineers , the savings for Mississippi River shippers who would use the new upstream route would be $1.200.000 annually . In addition , the Corps listed some benefits to local traffic . Congress agreed , and the project was authorized . The point is this : had the Corps of Engineers been required to prove that its Mississippi River navigation projects were paying off , it surely could not have recommended the Warrior-Tombigbee project . It would have needed to keep the up-river traffic on the Mississippi as a justification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or even of proper accounting , however , the Corps felt itself justified in taking on the new and extremely expensive program . Ironically enough , it is the increased speed of the Mississippi ? brought about by the Corps ' own diking and channelization ? which makes the second project economically attractive in the Corps ' eyes . The reluctance of the Corps to charge tolls against those who use its waterways makes it very popular wherever navigation works exist . Many people , however , strongly believe that the federal government should charge for its services . User-charges would have two effects : they would help pay for the out-of-hand costs of construction and maintenance ; more important , they would serve as a test of benefit estimates . Without tolls , or any other measuring device , no one can prove whether a benefit lias actually materialized . The Corps can make , within limits , almost any estimate necessary to win Congressional approval . No one checks up to see whether any advantages have been gained . After the federal money has been spent , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is concerned , President Roosevelt said in 1940 : " I have always believed that many facilities made available to our citizens by the government should be paid for , at least in part , by those who use them . " He mentioned " the $50,000,000 that the government spends annually on the Maintenance of dredged channels , buoys , lighthouses , life-saving stations , and so forth . It would seem reasonable that some portion of these annual expenditures should come back in the form of small fees . . . . " The Corps always has opposed tolls , however . One of the main incentives behind plans for waterways is a desire on the part of local business interests , who in turn influence Congress , to force down railway rates by competition from toll-free waterways . The Corps is shrewd enough to realize that if shippers were forced to pay tolls , the differential between water and rail freight rates would tend to disappear ? along with the justification for the waterway . It is true that the present system does sometimes bring down the rail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? as a countermeasure , frequently the railroads raise the rates on other products and the average citizen benefits not at all . The Corps has been notoriously lax in evaluating its proposed waterways as part of the national transportation complex . Not once have the Army Engineers made a systematic study of waterways as a component of a system that includes water , rail , trucks , and pipelines . Only once was a Corps project ? the Lake Erie ? Ohio River canal ? evaluated by the Interstate Commerce Commission ; the ICC found it undesirable and Congress refused to vote funds . IV T HE relationship between water and rail rates is particularly important in considering the Pick-Sloan Plan , now under construction in the Missouri Valley . The Pick-Sloan Plan reveals all the elements of confusion and competition between the Bu-reau of Reclamation and the Corps of Engineers . It alone is enough to show the need for responsible administration of a national water policy . A rough idea of the confusion that exists can be gained from this : neither the Bureau of Reclamation nor the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water there is in the Missouri . It is almost certainly true that there is not enough water to maintain in dry years the Army 's proposed nine-foot navigation channel from Sioux City to the mouth . There is grave doubt there will ever be enough water ? even in wet years ? for the Bureau 's ambitious irrigation plans , plus navigation . There is grave doubt that irrigation is even desirable in the area . There is still graver doubt that the expensive navigation installations are worth the money . What is certain is this : the Corps and the Bureau have rushed the nation into a billion-dollar undertaking without sufficient planning or investigation . And they have busted up a river that should have been developed as a whole . Competition between the agencies is to blame for this piecemeal attack on the Missouri . Major General Lewis A. Pick , now Chief of Engineers , came up originally with a plan for twenty-two dams ; W. G. Sloan of the Bureau of Reclamation came up with ninety dams ; Pick called for 1,500 miles of levees ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pick said he would generate some power ; Sloan said lie would generate 758,500 kilowatts . On this basis , the Corps and the Bureau were slugging it out on the river and in Congress for funds . Then the Corps and the Bureau were driven into each other 's arms by a common threat : the proposal of a Missouri Valley Authority , modeled after the formidably successful Tennessee Valley Authority . To forestall such a creation , the Corps and the Bureau reached a " compromise . " Earlier , the Bureau had attacked the Pick plan in several instances as wasteful and unnecessary ; the Corps had returned the compliment sneer for sneer . But when the MVA was proposed , they hastily came to terms . " Every project in both plans was incorporated into the joint venture except the Army 's Oak Creek Dam , " said Rufus Terral of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch , " and it would have been included too if its site were not to be submerged by another dam . One way or another , the two agencies had agreed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than $150,000,000 of the people 's money . " Said the Hoover Commission : " The ' compromise ' consisted For the most part in a division of projects , each agency agreeing to forego the privilege of criticizing projects assigned by the agreement to the other . The result is in no sense an integrated development plan for the Basin . . . . Agreement between the two agencies may be more costly to the public than disagreement . . . " The nine-foot channel for the Missouri has been approved . It was recommended on the ground that the present six-foot channel ? which cost approximately $70,000,000 ? is inadequate ; barge operators must change equipment between the Missouri and the Mississippi because of the Mississippi 's nine-foot channel . Given a nine-foot channel in the Missouri , the argument ran , there will be complete interchangeability of equipment between the two rivers . Now , without knowing whether there is enough water available , the nine-foot channel is being constructed in the Missouri . Simultaneously , the project for increasing the depth of the Mississippi channel to twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed , interchangeability of equipment will be as impossible as ever . Behind that cloud of confusion around the nine-foot channel in the Missouri is again the lure to the local interests of a chance to force down railroad rates . The project will cost many , many millions , and there is actually no guarantee that rail rates will he forced down . At present , in the expensive six-foot channel , about all that moves on the river are barge-loads of sand and gravel ? most of which are used to build levees by the Corps of Engineers . In their hurry to get authorization and money , the Corps and the Bureau almost overlooked the river itself . Scant recognition was given to the problem of fish and wildlife . This colloquy between Charles E. Jackson , assistant director of the Fish and Wildlife Service , and Major General Thomas M. Robins , of the Corps , is illustrative : Mr. Jackson was arguing that fish and wildlife must be considered in any river development : MAGAZINE JACKSON : I do n't know what plans you have for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have n't seen it yet . You see , some progress is made before we have had the opportunity to know what is contemplated on the Missouri . . . . Roansrs : I did n't know there was any fish problem on the Missouri River . JACKSON : That is exactly why we want to be consulted before any project is undertaken . V N 0 SENSIBLE effort has been made to evaluate all the soil and water conservation needs of the Missouri Valley , or in any other way to combine estimates and consider the valley as a single watershed . The Department of Agrculture has only recently submitted a hastily prepared plan for the expenditure of several billion dollars for soil conservation on the same watershed . The Federal Power Commission estimates that it would need $250,000 to survey adequately the power potential and market in the valley . The Bureau 's plan for the Missouri provided for the production of 758,500 kilowatts of power . The Corps , reluctant to build power facilities , merely said it would develop power ; it did not say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a recurring strand in the conflict between the Bureau and the Army Engineers . The Bureau is committed to produce power : power revenues help pay off the investment for irrigation works . It operates under a law which gives public agencies first chance at its power at low rates . It advocates construction of transmission lines to load centers where the public power can be picked up by small cooperatives and municipal distribution systems . The Corps opposes construction of transmission lines . It would sell its power at the bus bar ? i.e. , at the generators . This is precisely what the private utilities want ; the Army is supported in its program by these utilities . By 1960 , the Hoover Commission estimates , federal plants will be producing 15 to 20 per cent of the power supply of the country . If all the power plants now listed as possibilities are ever built , the federal plant will ultimately he producing as much electric energy as the whole country produced in 1947 . It is obvious that a power policy , as a corollary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Corps of Engineers has also entered another large field of public endeavor which promises to be costly to the taxpayers . In the 1944 Flood Control Act ? the latest of the major laws in the field ? " major drainage projects " were made a part of flood control . No one seems to know where these three words came from or how they got into the Act , except that it is almost certain that a congressman from the lower Mississippi was the author . Two major drainage projects have been authorized so far ? on the lower Mississippi , of course . These major works will be one hundred per cent federal gifts ; the local interests must only clear the land and construct minor works . There is no anti-speculation provision in the law . If you own a swamp and are lucky enough to get the Corps of Engineers to drain it for you , you can sell it at any price you can get ; the people of the United States will gladly pay the bill . There may be federal responsibility for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility should go further than the giving of reimbursable aid . Here again , various uses of water should be carefully examined . Some drainage operations have produced inferior agricultural land . And swamp land is not necessarily waste land . It is important as a nesting ground for wild fowl and as spawning grounds for fish . Drainage operations arc expensive . So is maintenance of a drainage project . The fact that drainage was slipped into a bill enlarging the functions of the Army Engineers , without adequate local participation or anti-speculation provisions , would seem to he a mistake . The Hoover Commission , with its task force on natural resources , looked at alI the facts . It recommended the transfer of the civil functions of the Corps of Engineers to a Water Development and Use Service in the Department of the Interior . The functions of the Bureau of Reclamation would also be transferred to this Water Service . Such a consolidation would give the country what it needs : a single agency charged with the responsibility for administering our water resources . The Commission also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board of Impartial Analysis which would review and co-ordinate all construction plans for the President before submission to Congress . Thus Congress could act on a co-ordinated program rather than struggle through competitive plans and counter-plans . Senator John J. McClellan and Carter Manasco , former Congressman from Alabama , bitterly attacked the plan to cut the Corps down to size . " This is a critical period in world history , " they wrote , as minority members of the Commission . " The uncertainties of the peace and the possibilities of another world war , it seems to us , should preclude any thought of weakening our military potentialities by turning from tried , tested , and proven policies and programs to an experimentation in something that has little hope of success . " Their argument , a favorite with supporters of the Corps , that the peacetime functions of the Engineers ? building dams and levees ? train soldiers for war was knocked in the head by the majority report : " The argument that river and harbor work can be directed only by the Army Engineers becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than two hundred Army Engineers are involved and that the remainder of the personnel under their control . . . are civilians who supply most of the detailed knowledge and continuing direction . . . . There is no reason why the same and even better results can not be obtained by assigning them Engineer officers and corresponding officers of the Navy and Air Forces . . . to a central consolidated works department . " With the two hundred officers out of the way , the report said , civilians might have the chance for promotion they deserve . Senator McClellan and Mr. Manasco , recalling the heroic folklore figure of the district engineer holding back the flood while the convicts work the levee , tried another barrel ? we need these brave officers in time of emergency : " A most recent example is the unprecedented blizzards that swept the West . Could the Bureau of Reclamation have been of comparable service to that performed by the Corps of Engineers in meeting the exigencies of this great peacetime emergency ? " Most significantly , the late James Forrestal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McClellan and Mr. Manasco in their dissent , although he was head of the Department which included the Corps . He did , however , abstain from joining the majority recommendation on the consolidation of the Corps ' civilian functions . Senator McClellan feels strongly about pruning the civil works of the Corps . And he is in a position to do something about it . He is chairman of the Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Departments , the corn/flitter dealing with the Hoover recommendations . It is notable that when the hearings this spring were recorded in 230 printed pages , more than half the talk was an effort to exempt the Corps from any reorganization plan . An effective reorganization , on the other hand , as recommended by the Hoover Commission , would put responsibility for our water resources up to one agency ? and demand results .
