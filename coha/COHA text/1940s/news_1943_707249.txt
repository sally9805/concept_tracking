txt Secretary Morgenthau 's announcement that the goal for the September War Loan Drive has been set at $15 , - 000,000,000 , largest single financial undertaking in the history of this or any other nation , does not come as a surprise . The remarkable showings of the first drive last December , and the second in April , set the stage . But what is breath-taking is that it is planned to raise all of the money from investors other than commercial banks . The volunteer sales force that will assume this tremendous task throughout the nation will be numbered in the tens of thousands . And , as usual , New York State will spearhead the drive . In the December drive $9,000,000,000 was the original goal . Midway in the campaign it was lifted to $11,000,000 , - 000 . The amount actually raised was $12,300,000,000 , of which the New York Federal Reserve District accounted for $5,865,000,000 , or more than 47 per cent . Of the national total sold to nonbanking investors , New York accounted for 65 per cent . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached $18,533,000,000 , of which $12 , - 550,000,000 was taken by non-bank investors . This time the New York district accounted for 39 per cent of the national total and 43 per cent of the national sales to non-bank purchasers . Prior to these drives the record piece of financing was the Fourth Liberty Loan Drive in 1918 , when $6,965,000 , - 000 was raised . To raise $15,000,000,000 from nonbanking institutions , corporations , estates , trust funds , fraternal and religious organizations and foundations , and individuals , it will be necessary for the nation-wide sales force to cover every community from the metropolis to the crossroads hamlet . Unlike the two previous drives , the campaign in September will be handled by War Finance Committees set up on State lines . In the previous drives the war bond part was handled by State War Savings Staffs in cooperation with Victory Loans Committees in each of the twelve Federal Reserve Districts . This time , Secretary Morgenthau has indicated ' that the Treasury prefers that subscriptions entered by corporations and firms be paid for through the banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , if the actual business of a corporation is located on the West Coast and the funds kept in New York City , then credit for the subscriptions would go to the New York State organization , which should aid the showing here . Heretofore , much needless bookkeeping has been necessary when a corporation chose to enter its subscriptions elsewhere and pay for them here . Profiting by past experience , the Treasury has wisely chosen to offer in September the same general " basket " of securities used to such good advantage in April , ranging from shortterm obligations to long-term bonds calculated to fill every investment need . Though the banks are left out this time , they will be offered new issues of securities both before and after the public drive in September . In the meanwhile plans for making the September drive a success can not be limited to the War Finance Committees . Every corporation , firm , organization and individual must begin now to figure out what purchases each can make . The War Finance groups will need subscriptions , not heartiest good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history .
