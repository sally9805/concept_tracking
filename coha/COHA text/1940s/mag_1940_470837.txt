So MANY things are happening in the world to-day , events are moving with such dizzy speed , that to try to think ahead for more than a week or two might seem a useless undertaking . I do not know as I write these words what may have come to pass by the time they appear in print . Possibly we may be by then on the point of going to war , or even already at war . We have begun to arm ourselves on a scale that a little while ago would have seemed to us fantastic ; but it will take us years to complete the job , and in the meanwhile we do not know for sure that the dictators will allow us the time to finish it . We arc now in the position of having to be mentally and emotionally ready to fight several wars simultaneously before we are physically prepared for one . And yet , out of the welter of uncertainties that beset us there are some things that stand out as inescapably certain : We must go through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a nation we shall have to pay the great cost of it as we go , irrespective of the budget of our government ? simply because we shall have available to consume and use during the period of the emergency only what we can produce during that period . And finally , whether we are given time in a military sense or not , we shall be allowed but little leeway in the matter of our ailing economic system . We must hurry up and finish the task already started , of curing it and improving it , to the point where the doctrines we hate and fear can not undermine it . Above all we must take measures to forestall its collapse when the armaments program is over . Although as a nation we shall pay as we go , our government will have to spend money in colossal amounts . Must this money be borrowed , or will there be another way to get it ? Can we make our financial arrangements fit the fact that we are paying as we go , or must we add greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the latter , in an effort to shift the burden to posterity , we should be fooling ourselves . We should be postponing only the distribution of the burden , not the hearing of it . We should indeed be preparing a sorry mess for posterity , but it would not be the problem of paying for our armaments program . It would be the problem of making the descendants of most of us pay to the descendants of a few of us the enormous sums resulting from our national bookkeeping . These are matters we have got to think about ? now , rather than in future years . For unless we are resigned to the prospect of drifting into a situation that only a totalitarian dictatorship could cope with we must formulate the main elements of our financial program within the next few months . Most of us are unable by training and experience to deal with the larger aspects of planning the armaments program itself ; that is a job for experts . But most of us can grasp the essentials of the fiscal plan , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To comprehend the situation that confronts us , we must look at realities : at things and organizations and human attitudes . But unfortunately , if we would avoid tearing down the structure of our democratic society we shall be obliged also to give thought to the symbols , such as money and accounting systems . Let us begin by reviewing some of the important facts behind the realities . When the depression started eleven years ago it was nearly world-wide . But somehow the democracies , which then included Germany , seemed to suffer much more than did the totalitarian states . Presently Germany , with plenty of other troubles arising mostly out of the aftermath of the first World War , submitted to the dictatorship of a megalomaniac . This extraordinary man promised a minimum of economic security for everybody , along with a position for Germany as the world 's most powerful nation ? all these benefits in exchange for a freedom that to many of the people had come to seem but an empty word . And by and large , however worthless his pledges to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own people thus far he has kept his promises . He has done so by dealing in realities . He began by ignoring or sweeping aside all customary business and financial rules that threatened to interfere with maximum production . He demanded and obtained the fullest possible use of the energy and skill of every man , woman , and child in the country capable of making an effort . Unemployment was ended as a matter of course . He focused his own terrific emotional energies and those of the German people on the production , first , of what was indispensable for maintaining their health and strength , and then of everything that would be required for waging war . To his Minister of Finance he said in effect : " Make your system fit my plans . Use whatever technical means you find necessary ; but do not let lack of moneyor fear of debt ever for a moment slow down production . " Meanwhile Great Britain and France , as well as the United Slates and all other countries , were put on notice as to the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her fabulous success in rearmament and her plans for world conquest . But what with the depression , with failure to adjust traditional economic systems to the requirements of modern industrialism , and a sort of incredulity mixed with apathy that now seems hard to understand , nobody did anything much about getting ready for the shock that was coming . In France a vigorous effort was indeed begun in 1936 to cope with the economic situation , along lines somewhat similar to the program started in 1933 in America . But in France the reactionary elements were able shortly to overthrow the progressive government . The group gaining power , later discovered to be strongly imbued with fascist sympathies , began to nullify the reforms and social advances so promisingly inaugurated . Along with this , Nazi agents were busy fostering unrest and organizing potential traitors . By the time war broke out the masses of the French people were already disillusioned and doubtful as to what kind of economic regime they were expected to fight for . When under the pretext of military necessity they were subjected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was soon complete . The results are known to everybody . We in America have been watching the tragic spectacle in Europe with growing consternation . And now with the destruction of democratic France and the threatened conquest of Great Britain ? which would entail the loss to us of the co-operation of the British Navy for protection of the Western Hemisphere -- we have no choice but to make ourselves so powerful that if need be we could stand off the rest of the world . But in order to do so we shall have to meet and solve problems , social and economic and financial , unprecedented in our history . Potentially we are much stronger than the Germans . Our resources , both human and material , are far greater . In almost every phase of the modern industrial procedures that make for fighting power we are superior . But our economic system , particularly as regards distribution , has not recovered from the depression . We are still unable to provide jobs for nearly a quarter of our potential workers and for at least an equivalent amount of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devise a scheme whereby , without sacrificing our freedom of individual enterprise , we can distribute the output , and thus utilize the productive capacity , of all our capital and all our labor . If Hitler said , " Do not let lack of money or fear of debt ever for a moment slow down production , " we might well say to our own government , " Do not let anything but the preservation of our basic American liberties ever for a moment interfere with the maximum possible enjoyment and use of our rich heritage ? use of it exclusively for peace if we are let alone , but use of it for war too if this horror is thrust upon us . " But there 's the rub . The most cherished precept of our way of life is individual freedom ? of thought , of speech , of action . And since action of an economic character makes up the bulk of the occupation of nearly all of us , further impairment of such freedom as we still have in this respect is something we dread to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow the example of Nazi Germany , making all citizens the slaves of the state ? instead of considering , as we do , that the state exists only for the sake of its individual citizens ? we could soon make ourselves so much more formidable than the Germans that they would not dare to molest us . But we do not intend to abandon our freedom , certainly no more of it than must be sacrificed for our self-preservation ; for we believe that in the long run freedom will make for greater efficiency even in matters of physical production than will the mural and spiritual regimentation of the Germans . We realize nevertheless that we are faced with the loss of what we hold most dear unless we improve both the immediate efficiency and the long-run stability of our economic system . We can not afford to have a large part of our productive capacity idle now , nor do we dare run the risk of future depressions such as the one that still afflicts us . What would be the use of fighting to prevent the Nazis from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning round and embracing that way of life because otherwise our own economic system could not be made to function properly ? How to divide up the cost of making ourselves physically strong is just now one of our most urgent problems . In common with other nations , we have heretofore followed in emergencies the curious custom of borrowing from ourselves ; that is , the government has borrowed from the citizens . ( As will appear presently , modern governments also borrow from banks , which create the money by setting up credits in their books . ) We have justified the practice by the fact that some people arc always more competent and energetic than others , and we have considered it only fair that those working harder and more skillfully for the national welfare in a time of crisis should receive compensation from the nation as a whole when the emergency was over . But to resort to wholesale borrowing of this kind now would be hazardous , not to say foolhardy . Already we have greatly increased our internal debt , both to feed our unemployed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our defective system of distribution . But it remains true as always that some of us will now have to toil harder and more skillfully than others . And as usual the energetic and competent ones will expect to receive compensation later on . Will they have to be promised it in a form that will add to the internal debt and thus create embarrassment for the future ? Or will they be content to give of their best out of loyalty to the nation and for the sake of the opportunities they will have when the emergency is over ? III Our review of the facts poses the question . Or is it perhaps a dilemma ? Can we divert enough of our national income to armaments to make sure that our preparation will be adequate for any war we may have to wage without destroying the mechanisms and violating the principles of our democracy ? If we look at the problem theoretically , the solution is easy . Only a few well-known figures need be cited to show how easy . Our net national income in 1929 was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an authority as the Brookings Institution has estimated that , without any substantial improvement of our faulty methods of distribution , our productive capacity was such that the national income could have been raised to about $100,000,000,000 . Since 1929 the number of our potential workers has increased by something like 10% . At the same time the efficiency of our productive equipment , as well as that of our organization for production , is known to have been improved to a still greater degree . The output per man-hour in industry , for example , has increased by about 25% . Consequently the goal of a national income of $110 , - 000,000,000 a year , even at to-day 's lower price level , seems reasonable . As a matter of fact , we do not even begin to know what our productive capacity would be if we exerted our full powers . We have seen a hint of our potentialities in the performance of Nazi Germany , a country with probably less than half of our advantages . What we might do if we really tried ? not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all our people such an abundance of material welfare as only a few Utopians have dared to dream of ? fairly staggers the imagination . Let us use , however , the seemingly modest figure of $110,000,000,000 ( forgetting for the moment how difficult its achievement may prove to be in practice ) . We could take of it $10,000,000 , - 000 a year for armaments , or even $15,000,000,000 , and still permit the masses of our people to enjoy a standard of living higher than they have ever enjoyed before . During our participation in the war of 1914-18 we did in fact approximate something of the kind , for all our talk about tightening our belts . ( Do you remember how some of us were shocked at the spectacle of workers arriving at the job in tin lizzies and silk shirts ? ) But if we care about the future , we must avoid the pitfalls of financing that have caused trouble for our national economy ever since . Then we borrowed most of the extra money required , largely from our banks , through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were apparently unable or unwilling , either during the emergency or in the years following , to make our over-all fiscal transactions fit the fact that as a nation we were paying as we went . And yet , if we would preserve the mechanisms of democracy ? and those mechanisms are the very essence of democracy itself ? we must either again resort to borrowing or we must cover our increased expenditures for armaments in the only other possible way : through taxation on a scale we have never known before . Let us examine first the case for borrowing . There is an unanswerable argument for it as regards the immediate present . In no other way can we obtain maximum employment and production . Taxes in the required amounts would be so heavy a burden on private enterprise that even our present low levels of employment and production would be further lowered . Whatever the risks of starting off with borrowing , therefore , we must deliberately take them lest worse befall . And in point of fact the risks need not be very great . Through forethought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the national income up and keep it up . That is the really vital problem just now , and there can be no doubt that heavy government borrowing at this juncture ? especially since it will probably be mostly from banks ? will greatly increase the effective purchasing power in the country and thus augment the demand for goods and services . The danger of an internal debt even double the size of our present $45,000,000,000 would be insignificant in comparison with the danger of failing to make full use of our men and materials . Nevertheless , the piling up of such a debt would be dangerous , especially from a psychological point of view . There are still large numbers of otherwise well-informed people who continue to think of a government debt as being precisely the same as an ordinary business obligation , and probably such people still wield enough influence to throw the country into a panic when they themselves become badly frightened . Moreover the dangers are not merely psychological when the borrowing process gets out of hand . Then they become very real indeed ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not take measures to forestall them . There will be only one way to escape these dangers : to draw up and adopt a financial plan for the period of the emergency as a whole , so that by the time ( or shortly after ) our expenditures have leveled off to what appears to be normal we shall have paid off the debt incurred at the start . But before attempting to think through such planning , let us take a realistic look at the consequences of indefinitely continued borrowing . When a country 's internal debt becomes unbearably large , one of three things is bound to happen . First and most J repudiation . Third and least likely to likely is some form of inflation ; second is happen is a scientific scaling down of the debt , either through a capital levy or by a forced reduction in the interest rate coupled with postponement of payment of the principal . It is too well known to require comment that every country engaged in the war of 1914-18 was forced into some kind , or degree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application of the device , wiped out her internal debt ? and , through the hardships thus inflicted on her middle classes , contributed to the creation of the conditions that later resulted in Hiticrism . France went nearly as far , stopping only at the destruction of from three-fourths to four-fifths of her debt . * In Great Britain and the United States , inflation occurred , though in a lesser degree and in somewhat different forms . Without attempting to go into the technicalities of what happened then , here is what might happen now if we went on indefinitely increasing our internal debt : The government , theoretically , would sell its bonds to people who had savings . So long as this happened we could feel confident that there would be little or no danger of real inflation , bearing in mind that real inflation occurs only when there is a general and sustained rise in prices . But as a practical matter , greater and greater quantities of the bonds would be sold to banks ( or as in the first World War , people would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks would pay for them , not with money already in existence , but by entries in books crediting the government with the price of them , and these credits would at once became effective purchasing power . So long as the total amount of such credits did not exceed the amount of idle savings in the country ( the ineffective purchasing power ) it would still be possible to avoid real inflation , because the total amount of effective purchasing power would not have outstripped the total amount of goods and services offered for sale . But , if the borrowing went on indefinitely , at some stage of the process the state of balance would be upset : the amount of effective purchasing power ( being in- * This proportion would vary considerably with the date of the computation . " Three-fourths to four-fifths " is based on the price levels and the revalnation of 1926-27. creased by the credits to the government set up in the banks to pay for the bonds ) would become greater than the total amount of goods and services for sale at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise . Costs of everything , all over the place , would go up . The government would have to issue greater and greater amounts of bonds to pay for its purchases , and the spiral of inflation would be in full operation . Prices would rise higher and ever higher . People with fixed income would become progressively poorer and poorer . When an American incarnation of Hitler came along and offered such people ( whose number would be increasing ) a minimum of security in exchange for a freedom that had come to be meaningless , more and more of them would accept his offer . The cynic knew whereof he spoke when he said that men will die for freedom but will not starve for it . The vicious spiral of inflation of this kind can be stopped , short of wiping out the internal debt and with it the fortunes of everybody dependent on savings , only by the imposition of taxes high enough to cover more than the full expenditures of the government ? more , because the sinister thing can be arrested only when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrowing process will be reversed . The only other hope of checking it , theoretical rather than real , is that the banks might refuse to buy the government 's bonds . But try to imagine this ! Is there a banking system anywhere in the world that would dare to defy its government ? Of course there is not , and in the very nature of things there can not be . As to the other two possible methods of coping with a runaway debt ? repudiation and scientific scaling down ? we need only observe that the one would be likely to result in so severe a shock as to provoke revolution and the other would require a greater degree of courage and foresight on the part of the people 's representatives than would a prearranged program of adequate taxation , For the whole of the period of the emergency , therefore , we absolutely must make our budgetary operations conform to the fact that as a nation we are paying as we go . Can we do so without destroying our incentives to produce ? The answer will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display in drawing up our financial plan and the readiness of each of us to shoulder the nation 's burden in proportion to our strength rather than in accordance with preconceived notions of fairness or justice . When the town is burning down the citizens can not stop to bargain about the rewards each shall eventually receive for their exertions in putting out the fire . IV Apparently no government has ever succeeded in budgeting its revenues and expenditures over a period of several years . Emergencies have usually been met by borrowing , with only a hope ( unfulfilled in practice ) that afterwards revenues would be sufficient to liquidate the debts . But there is no reason why a democracy should not set a new example to the world , without sacrifice of the essentials of individual freedom , if its people will face up to their responsibilities as citizens . We do not know how long our efforts to meet the present emergency will last or how great our expenditures will have to be . Nor do we know what our normal outlays will be when we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , to consider a hypothetical long-term budget , say for ten years . We may be confident , however , that the National Defense Commission , aided by the War and Navy Departments , will be able shortly to provide the appropriate committees of Congress with estimates based on better knowledge of anticipated facts . And meanwhile our hypothetical ten-year budget will illustrate the principle involved , and perhaps it will provide an idea of the order of magnitude of the individual contributions called for . Let us assume that it will take seven years to arm ourselves to the point where we can feel reasonably secure in the kind of world it now seems likely we shall have to live in ; that the average cost of our extra effort will be $8,000,000,000 a year ( added to expenditures for all other purposes ) ; that at the end of the seven-year period we shall level off with an expenditure for everything of $12,000,000,000 a year . If these figures make your hair stand on end , just remember that they may turn out to be too small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as I know , nobody in authority in Washington has mentioned any so large . At any rate , go ahead and substitute your . own estimates . And if you think Hitler will not allow us the seven years , then add to your estimate of expenditures the cost of intervening , both with armed force and with financial aid , all over Latin America ? and , if you like , in Europe and the Far East . Our normal outlays will certainly increase on account of our enlarged military establishment . The cost of unemployment relief , however , should be reduced to negligible proportions -- otherwise , why go to the trouble to resist a social and economic philosophy that would have to be adopted sooner or later anyway ? A normal budget of $12,000 , - 000,000 a year after the emergency would seem to be a reasonable expectation ? maybe higher than we shall actually have to endure . We shall probably need from two to four years to step up our economic activity to the point of maximum employment and production . During this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in diminishing amounts . And needless to say , the interest rates should remain low . " No more 5% Liberty Bonds " might well be our watchword . It is not certain that the amounts to be borrowed will diminish because it may be that our expenditures for armaments will go up fastcr than our over-all level of economic activity . At any rate , it appears likely that our internal debt will have to be increased by at least $8,000 , - 000,000 or $10,000,000,000 and maybe more , before we reach a stage where revenues from taxation can be made to equal current expenditures . That stage of course will come when we have attained to something approximating maximum employment and production . It should be reached well within a period of four years , else our situation will be little short of desperate . For purposes of the present analysis , let us assume that our methods of distribution remain substantially unchanged and that we may therefore use the figure of $110,000,000,000 referred to a while ago , for the national income we may hope to attain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and services of all kinds , including armaments , is represented by an aggregate of effective purchasing power in the country equal to it . The rise in effective purchasing power may be expected to result from the increased outlays of the government and from the increased expenditures of private enterprise , whether for plant expansion or for the production and marketing of goods and services both for general consumption and for war preparation . If the great reservoirs of idle savings in the country were promptly invested in plant expansion or otherwise spent , they would of course become effective purchasing power ; and consequently the government 's expenditures of borrowed money could be proportionately reduced . Nobody knows to what extent this will happen ; but whatever the outcome , the borrowings of the government should compensate for at least the amount of savings remaining idle . So long as these borrowings actually are from savings that would otherwise be idle , or so long as they are represented by book credits set up in banks to pay for bonds in an aggregate amount not in excess of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not yet reached maximum employment and production . Likewise there need be no fear of inflation in the sense of a great rise in the general price level . Manifestly it would never do to allow production and consumption of goods and services in general , as distinct from armaments , to remain at present low levels . This would be disastrous so long as our output did not approach a maximum . If before that time we were misguided enough to stop expenditures for relief of the unemployed or try to limitgoal is reached they will he in excess of current expenditures . Thereafter , for as long as we can maintain approximately this maximum ? or a higher one ? and until the excess of revenues over expenditures has reduced the internal debt to the level decided upon in advance , revenues should continue to exceed expenditures by the required amounts . general consumption ( except of such key products as might be scarce ) , we should prevent the national income from rising to a point where we could take enough of it in taxes to accomplish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preach tightening of belts immediately would be plain economic insanity . While we are climbing up to maximum employment and production , however , our revenues from taxation should be progressively increased , so that when the All these elements can be estimated and calculated at the start of the program . They can be embodied in a law ; and , what is more important , the whole sequence of events can be made subject to automatic procedure , so that Congress need delegate none of its powers . That is to say , the level of federal taxes due and payable from year to year ( perhaps in the case of excise taxes for shorter periods ) can be made to rise along with , but at a faster rate than , the rise of the productive activity of the country , as measured by a number of reliable indexes such as those of the Federal Reserve Board and the Bureau of Labor Statistics . The sliding scale of the rates of all the various kinds of taxes estimated to produce the revenues required , together with the precise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occur , would be written into the law . Then from time to time the Bureau of Internal Revenue would make the prescribed computations and announce the rates to be applied thereafter until a new computation was made . Thus the chance of arbitrary action by executive agencies would be virtually eliminated and the Congress would be in effect exercising to the full its prerogative as the sole taxing authority of the federal government . The accompanying chart will show what might happen over a ten-year period ? using figures that may be altered at the pleasure of the reader who prefers to make his own guess . Among the indications of when we shall be approaching maximum employment and production will be the behavior of the general price level and the index of the cost of living . If a pronounced rise occurs , and at the same time the other indexes show there is little or no involuntary unemployment , it will mean that real inflation is commencing . It will be the signal that the time has come to stop increasing the effective purchasing power in the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply a brake to consumption . If we do not do these things we shall be inviting the dangerous spiral of inflation . But if the Congress has the courage to make a long-term budget based on the estimated requirements of the armaments program , and to abide rigorously by it , we shall have at least a fighting chance to liquidate the borrowings resorted to at the start . Can we have any absolute assurance that our productive activity will in fact rise in accordance with the foregoing assumptions ? No . It will depend in large measure on the spirit of nationalunity we are able to achieve . Another element in the situation , about which we can only hope for the best , is the extent to which bottlenecks in key industries may interfere with both the armaments program and the step-up of employment and production . But the nature of the long-term tax program itself will be of great importance . If it is to serve a constructive rather than an obstructive purpose , it must be so devised as to distribute the burden with publicly recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by those who will have to carry the bulk of the load . V Space would not allow me to outline here a fully developed tax program , even if I were competent to do so . The subject is tediously technical and intensely boring to most people . There are , however , a few treatises that deal with it in terms easily understood by almost anybody . The best book I have come across of this kind is the Twentieth Century Fund 's publication of 1937 , Facing the Tax Problem . * Clearly our tax system needs overhauling from top to bottom , with proper integration worked out for Federal , State and local taxes ; but consideration of this would go far beyond the scope of the present discussion . Here , as promised at the beginning , I shall deal on broad lines only with the essentials of the Federal problem . The crude and obvious way to meet the situation would be to impose at once a general sales tax high enough to raise the money . It would require payment to the Treasury of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the persons and organizations in the country . This method would be out of the question , however , for a number of reasons . Apart from its brutal suddenness , the result of its application would be that the low-income families , comprising well over half of our total population , would * The specific recommendations included in this book of course would not now be applicable . have their effective purchasing power and therefore their standard of living drastically cut at a time when already they are either at the point where further reduction would cause acute privation or they are on the ragged edge of starvation ; and meanwhile the well-to-do would hardly notice the increased burden . We can not , however , solve the problem by taxing only the rich , or even only the well-to-do . If for no other reason , there are not enough of them and the total of their incomes would be hardly sufficient . Some figures from the income tax returns of recent years will make this clear . From 1937 incomes , for example , if we had taxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained additional revenue of only $232,000,000 . Even for 1929 the corresponding figures would have been only $3,256,000,000 . Lowering the limit to take in everybody who could be considered well-to-do , say all persons with over $10,000 a year , if we had confiscated all in excess of this amount the additional revenue from 1937 incomes would have been $2,312,000,000 and from 1929 incomes $7,486,000,000 . Although we do not know precisely what the additional expenditures caused by the armaments program will be , it is evident that the revenues obtainable by such drastic measures as the foregoing would be hardly adequate , even when we reach and surpass the income levels of 1929 . And only a little thought is needed to make it clear that taxation on this scale would be impracticable . Merely to remember the family establishments employing a considerable number of persons directly and providing a great deal of employment indirectly by their expenditures for goods and services , is enough to permit us to visualize what the results would be . ( Of course the Socialists will have a ready answer . But inasmuch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them not to write and tell me about it , unless they are prepared to explain where we should get the large group of officials competent and willing to administer their theoretically admirable system so as to avoid revolution and chaos and the probability of ending up with some degenerate form of fascism . ) If we wanted to risk abandoning our democratic principles ( hoping that it would be only temporarily ) , we might of course follow the example of Nazi Germany . In that case we should compel every person and every organization in the country , under threat of death , to work and produce up to maximum ability . We should fix by fiat all wages , all prices , all profits ; we should rigorously control all imports and exports and the foreign exchange transactions arising out of them ; we should limit the amount of money that every individual or organization could retain ; and then we should seize the remainder of the national income for the Treasury . Thus , no doubt , we could balance the budget and the government could begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have become in effect a totalitarian dictatorship , no matter what we called ourselves . Since we prefer not to resort to any such solution , the backbone of our revenue program will have to be the graduated personal income tax , supplemented by estate ( inheritance ) and gift taxes , corporation income taxes , excess profits taxes , and certain carefully considered taxes directly affecting consumption . The persona ! income tax will have to be graduated in the sense that the percentages taken will go higher and higher with the greater amount of the income , only because a family with a large income can endure giving up a higher percentage of it than can a family with a small income . For example , if a family with a total income of $1,000 a year had to give up 10% of it , somebody would go without shoes or dental or medical service , if not without adequate food . But a family with $10,000 a year could give up 10% and still have $9,000 left . They could give up 25% and still have $7,500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50% they would still have $5,000 a year to maintain a decent standard of living . Our present income taxes , to be sure , are based on this principle . But the exemptions have been so wide and the rates so low , except for the very high incomes , that most of us have felt them either not at all or very lightly . We shall therefore ? those of us who have been accustomed to buying anything we wanted without thinking much about it ? have to brace ourselves for some genuine sacrifices . The lowest-income families need not suffer , indeed , their situation may very well be substantially improved , just as it was during the first World War ; but the rest of us will have to tighten our somewhat ample belts . VI Nearly half of the total income of the federal government in recent years has been obtained from taxes directly affecting consumption . The bulk of the sums thus collected has come from taxes on tobacco , liquor , gasoline , and imports of all kinds ( customs duties , usually referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue derived from consumption has been obtained by taxes on miscellaneous items for which people spend money , such as theater and movie tickets , automobile parts and accessories , furs , toilet preparations , and a long list of goods and services that Congress apparently has deemed to be luxuries or semi-luxuries . Although no doubt considered unavoidable , this is a deplorable way to raise revenue in time of depression , since the heaviest burden of it falls on the masses of the people . The principal kinds of taxes that are less likely to affect consumption are the personal income tax , the estate and gift taxes , the corporation income tax , and the excess profits tax . These are likely , especially in the higher brackets , to be paid with money that would otherwise be saved . In the aggregate , since 1933 , the yield of such taxes has varied from less than 50% to a little over 60% of the total federal receipts exclusive of the Social Security taxes . Social Security taxes are in a special category . About half of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus reduce the purchasing power available to workers . They should be given close scrutiny , to see if perhaps they are not causing too heavy a burden on the numerous poor at a time when , in order to raise the general level of production and consumption , the largest element of our population ought to have more , not less , money to spend . If substantially all the net income of corporations and other business concerns were currently distributed to stockholders or owners , both the corporation income tax and the excess profits tax might well be either abolished or substantially reduced . The graduated personal income tax would then do a better and fairer job . But unfortunately such is not the case . These taxes therefore have to be levied , on some sort of compromise basis . They can not be steeply graduated , like the personal income tax , because the actual income from all sources of the persons who are stockholders or owners , even of very large businesses , may vary widely ? from small to quite large amounts , although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very poor . The compromise is usually arrived at by taking some percentage which is believed to be endurable by all stockholders or owners , even those entirely dependent on income from the businesses in question . Unfortunately this arrangement leaves loopholes . Under it stockholders or owners whose income would be very large and thus subject to high personal taxes if all of it were turned over to them , can let a large part remain undistributed in order to escape a substantial portion of the taxes otherwise payable on it . The undistributed profits tax of recent memory was an attempt to plug this particular loophole ; but for a number of reasons Congress has repealed it . Another device , hitherto untried and of a somewhat advanced nature , deserves careful consideration now . It would require all corporations or other businesses to report the precise amount of undistributed net income accruing to each stockholder or owner , whereupon this amount would be added to the taxable income ( from dividends and all other sources ) already computed for each , and the total thus resulting would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , for the big incomes ) . If this plan were adopted and could be properly administered , it is clear that the corporation income tax and the excess profits tax ( both of which also involve knotty problems of administration ) could go . Another troublesome problem encountered in taxing business profits , whether considered normal or excessive , is the allowable depreciation or amortization of the investment of the stockholders or owners . It has been especially vexatious in recent months in connection with the excess profits tax on plants built to produce war materials . How important it is , from the standpoint of the Treasury as well as from that of the taxpayer , may be seen by considering a simple case . Suppose the factory is to cost $1,000,000 , but the prospective owners of it believe that five years hence it will be useless and therefore worth nothing . Its annual profits over the next five years , before depreciation , are estimated to average 30% on the original investment . If the owners are to recover their investment by the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be reduced by a depreciation charge of 20% , leaving a net of only 10% . But somebody else ( the Treasury or the Congress perhaps ) might believe with equal sincerity that the factory will be needed for at least ten years . In this event the net profits of the owners might figure out at 20% and thus be subject to stiff taxes . There are still other difficult problems , particularly as regards administration , that must be solved or compromised in connection with the taxes collectible from those with relatively high incomes . The estate and gift taxes are examples , as are also the taxes on capital gains andthe allowable deductions for capital losses . Neither discussion nor proposals for solution of these problems can be included here . But when bitter disputes arise over them we should do well to be careful about jumping to conclusions about either the greediness of one side or the red radicalism of the other . The differences of opinion may very well be honest , with neither side entirely devoid of patriotic feelings . With all its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the inestimable advantage of ethical fairness and economic soundness . It apportions the burden in accordance with ability to bear , and it tends to keep the potential purchasing power of the country effective ; for it weighs least heavily on those who must spend at once the bulk of their incomes for necessities . It is so far superior to all other forms of taxation that , whatever compromises may be necessary in its practical application , we must make it now as never before the cornerstone of our fiscal structure . VII As the main source of federal revenue , the personal income tax should begin at about $1,500 per family and $800 per single person , with an additional exemption of $300 for each dependent . There should be written into the law three or four schedules of rates , more and more steeply graduated as higher levels of employment and production are reached . These should be worked out in connection with the estimates forming the basis of the long-tetrn budget . For the low incomes however ( e.g. those under $2,500 a year ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition to enacting the appropriate schedules and prescribing the other elements of the long-term budget , Congress should stop the loopholes that now permit many persons to escape substantial amounts of income tax . The one having to do with undistributed profits has already been described . If the somewhat advanced method suggested were employed to stop it , the loss from discontinuing or reducing the corporation income tax and the excess profits tax would be more than made up by the increased yield of the personal income tax Other loopholes , for which the remedy is more or less obvious , are : The privilege of husband and wife to file separate returns , abolition of which alone would probably produce additional revenue of over $1,000,000,000 a year when the national income approaches $110,000,000,000 . Imperfections in the estate and gift taxes ( for which , unfortunately , the remedy is not obvious ) . Continued issue by the Federal as well as the State and local governments of tax-exempt securities . Taxes on consumption ( except of scarce key products ) should not be increased lation . Schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at $85,000,000,000 ; Schedule B at $100 , - 000,000,000 ; and Schedule C at $110 , - 000,000,000 . Thus a married couple without dependents , having $1,500 a year of net income , would not pay anything until a national income of $85,000,000,000 was reached , whereupon they would pay $7.50 , then $15 , and finally $30 as the national income rose to $110,000,000,000 . Payment should not be required at all unless taxes on consumption are reduced at once , and then only for moral effect and in order to begin applying a brake to consumption later on , rather than for the revenue obtainable . The same couple with $5,000 a year , however , would begin to feel the effects rather seriously . Unover present rates until the national income approaches a maximum . Indeed we ought to consider at once lowering such taxes and raising the rates On personal incomes in the brackets of $5,000 to $100,000 enough to compensate for the resulting loss of revenue . In the hypothetical budget above this is assumed to have been done , to the extent that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national income is assumed to be increasing . To attempt to work out and include here samples of the kind of schedules used by the Bureau of Internal Revenue would be a needless complication . Some notion of the burden on individual taxpayers of various incomes may be obtained , however , from this tabuder the 1940 Act ( disregarding credit for earned income ) they are required to pay $160 , but under these schedules they would have to contribute $300 , then $400 , and finally $500 a year . If this couple had $10,000 a year their taxes would commence to bear down hard . Instead of the $680 payable now , they would have to pay $1,400 , then $2,200 , and finally $3,000 a year . The yield to the federal government of these schedules would be difficult to estimate with high accuracy , chiefly because we can not know what the numbers of persons failing in the different income brackets will be . Consequently the figures given above are based on some very rough computations . We may feel confident , however , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce approximately the revenues required . Based on the foregoing , let us now construct for purposes of illustration a hypothetical and highly condensed ten-year budget ( excluding the Social Security receipts and expenditures ) , bearing in mind that the taxes on consumption should be flexible-to be raised or lowered to correct inflation or deflation . Can we achieve such a budget in practice , ending the ten-year period with an accumulated surplus of $4,000,000,000nomic and financial activities fit this fact , so that when we have completed the transformation in our world outlook that Hitler has forced upon us , we shall still be able to preserve the essentials of our democracy by having spared it the danger of a disrupted fiscal system . The heart and center of our problem is production : the full use of our magnificent productive equipment , our plentiful natural resources , and our abundant man power . If too many of us do not hold back too long to drive hard bargains with the rest of us , we can do the job . to be used for reduction of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the required income-tax schedules themselves . We need not bother to compare them with the enormously higher schedules that the people of England are now enduring ( starting at 4234% as opposed to from 2 to 3% for comparable real incomes with us ) to appreciate how easy , in the hard world we inhabit , our material burdens may be . We must , however , fully realize the necessity to bear them , remembering first that as a nation we shall in fact , unavoidably , pay as we go . Then we shall have to make our complicated eco-VIII And after we have completed our armaments program , what then ? What will happen when we reduce the effective purchasing power that the government will have been pouring into the hands of millions of people ? Unless we take thought beforehand and carry out bold and farsighted measures , we shall face the worst depression we have ever had . It would make the decade of the thirties seem like prosperity by comparison . To prevent it we shall have to maintain something like the high level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may find it desirable to reduce hours of labor and thus have more leisure and less goods and services than would be obtainable through maximum work by everybody . We can maintain the level desired only if the reduction in effective purchasing power up to then being distributed by the government is compensated . Compensation can be brought about by the prompt return to circulation of all savings , either through investment of them or otherwise . But the proportion of the national income saved can be drastically lowered through a widespread increase in consumption , which could result in the highest standard of living in history . How these things are to be done is not the principal subject of this article . A few specific measures , however , may be mentioned . As already suggested , taxes on consumption should be reduced to the vanishing point . And inasmuch as the heaviest tax burdens on consumers are those of the State and local governments , every effort should be made to get these lowered too . One possible way to do it would be to have the Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the income tax , for their abolition of sales taxes and other levies on consumption . Reduction of taxes on consumption would be like removing the pressure from a powerful spring ; consumption of goods and services would immediately increase . All possible encouragement , short of impairing the freedom of opportunity we are committed to maintain for everybody alike , should be given to private enterprise to invest promptly all the savings that are in fact made . The production of good low-cost housing , particularly for those who prefer to rent rather than own their dwellings , could provide a very important field for such investment . In this connection we should attack the fundamentals of the problem of attracting savings into actual ownership ofrental housing rather than into mortgages on it . If this could be done on a scale adequate to meet the country 's housing needs , a large proportion of the funds accumulated in such institutions as life insurance companies , savings banks , and building and loan associations could be readily absorbed . If also we could devise a plan for complete rehabilitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable period hope to find outlets for all the savings actually accumulated . But for keeping in circulation such amounts as are not used by private enterprise the government will have to accept responsibility . A plan whereby this responsibility could be met , with a minimum of interference with private enterprise , was outlined in an article of mine in Harper 's for December , 1939 , calling for a governmental Department of Investments to take up the slack . Some such scheme should be organized and held ready for application the moment that our emergency expenditures begin to diminish . We are facing a period of uncertainty and danger . We have faced such periods in the past and emerged from them stronger than ever . By taking thought and by acting with determination and courage we can do so again . But now we must have teamwork of a sort that has never been necessary before . Hitler and his spokesmen say with contempt that we can not get it and retain democracy ; that the strong and competent will not work for and with the weak and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the present and for the future . If they withhold the full measure of their energy and skill now or Later , our American dream will be over . With armies and navies we can doubtless stop Hitler , but not Hiderism ; for in the long run there will be only one way to give him and his henchmen the lie : by making our democracy fulfill its promises of freedom and plenty for all .
