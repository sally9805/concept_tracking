IS MUNCIE STILL MIDDLETOWN ? JOHN BARTLOW MARTIN As a reporter in Indianapolis , Mr. Martin used to cover Muncie for his paper and the AP . More recently he has made two fact-finding trips to Muncie ? one in 1939 and another this spring . wAS in Muncie , Indiana , last April when Willkie withdrew as a candidate for the Republican nomination . There was a lot of talk about him ? on street corners , at mealtime , and in the press ? but almost nobody mentioned isolation-ism , internationalism , or any other issue of the campaign . Those who liked him did so , apparently , because he was practically a home-town boy . His international views did n't seem to make any difference one way or the other . This focus on home-town concerns set me to wondering . " Muncie ? the typical American city " runs the legend on place mats in the Town Room , or coffee shop , of the Hotel Roberts in Muncie , Indiana , and the same proud slogan adorns the stationery of the Muncie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon Muncie 's having been chosen as " Middletown , U.S.A. , " by two sociologists for their 1925 and 1935 studies in mid-American culture . It raises the question whether today Muncie at war is , in little , America at war . On the walls of the hotel 's coffee shop there are murals depicting a factory and a worker , an executive making a phone call , a bridge table , a farm building , a pig , a workman pouring molten glass , and ? prominently ? two glass jars , symbols of the continuing might of the Ball brothers , the millionaires who once ruled Muncie completely . The Town Room , the dining room , the lobby , and the cocktail lounge of the Roberts are modern , but upstairs the rooms are high-ceilinged , the shower in the bathroom looks as if it were superimposed on older plumbing , the bathroom walls are streaked with grime and soot . Keeping curtains clean in a Muncie house is difficult . This is a factory town ; it is a dirty town . From the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt good . The only lighted places were the saloons . " There is a boomtown flavor in Muncie now , " the newspaperman said . " A doctor told me the other day that people who used to pay their bills with township orders now are paying them with twenty-dollar bills . And they 'll be on the township again . Right now they 've got more money than they know what to do with . There is n't a vacant house or apartment in town . The saloons are crowded . The factories are working three shifts . But only one new plant of any size has come to town ? Goodyear . It 's just that the factories that 've been here since before the war are all busier than they 've ever been . " He had been a newspaperman here most of his life . Once he passed up a chance to leave Muncie as a well-paid public relations man . " I 'll always stay here now , I guess . Been here too long . " Sure , he said , better-paying jobs were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what ? " Just about everybody here thinks there 's going to be a bust-up after the war , " he added . " They 're all scared of it . But they do n't do anything about it because they are n't capable of thinking about the future . " Postwar international affairs ? " I never hear any talk about that . People here do n't care about other countries . They 're strong isolationists . A few people think we 'll have to fight Russia some day . You hear a lot of anti-British talk . People think that every time Churchill and Roosevelt get together , Churchill steals something else from him . " r ) Y NOW it was a little past /1 P.M.and o the cocktail lounge in the hotel and nearly all the other saloons had closed . Liquor is getting scarce ; early closing is a form of voluntary rationing . To buy beer to take out you need empty bottles ; to buy whisky you need a friend . Nevertheless some saloons remain open past eleven , notably those catering to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pig Stand on South Walnut Street , not far from the railroad tracks and diagonally across Walnut from CIO headquarters . ( The CIO and UAWA offices , boldly marked by electric signs , are , oddly , only four doors south of the Ball department store . The fight to unionize the Ball glass works has been long . ) The Pig Stand was jammed . True , Muncie savings accounts and checking accounts have risen since 1941 , and safe deposit boxes are not to be had , and debts are being paid off fast ; and more than ten million dollars ' worth of small investors ' war bonds have been sold and are being cashed only at the rate of 7 per cent ( below the national average ) ; but not all the workers are putting their inflated earnings into the sock . Some , that night in April , were bellying up three-deep to the Pig Stand bar . The floor was covered with what appeared to be sawdust but turned out to be tip-book tabs that had n't paid off . The juke box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one red leather booth to another . A great many of the men in the crowd were young men ; nobody remarked them ; in this industrial city it is assumed that a young man in mufti is either 4F or an essential industry worker . Watching the shifting crowd at the bar , the young CIO leader , Ed Crago , answered my questions . " What are they thinking about ? About their job ; about the war . They are not thinking about the future . " He told me about the service flags hanging in the headquarters of the CIO locals , bearing silver stars , blue stars , gold stars , so many stars that they crowded the flags , and a committee was appointed to investigate the feasibility of adopting a one-star flag carrying numerals which could be changed . " Some of our best leadership is in the service , " Crago said . " The boys in the service come back to see us . Last Saturday night we threw a dance at the hall and there were a lot of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the Aleutians twenty-six months . I asked him what he did with his spare time . He said , ' We sit around and discuss unions . ' " At the time of my visit , about 10 per cent of Muncie 's total population-5,000 out of 52,000 ? had gone into the armed forces . Similarly , Delaware County , of which Muncie is the seat , had sent about 7,500 men out of a total population of 75,000 . About 60 had been killed . Crago once coached " a ball club , " that is , a basketball team , at his plant . ( In Indiana they say : " First you put up two peach baskets on posts ; then you build your high school around them . " ) " Two years ago the world 's champion pro team only beat us by ten points . And we led them at half time . Well , one of my best ballplayers , he could shoot either right-or left-handed ? his Dad works at Chevrolet too ; he 's one of the oldest employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I 've seen him even now stand and bend down and touch his toes with his fingers . Anyway , his boy was drafted . His last furlough home , the boy got married . Then they sent him to England . He ca n't have made many flights there . It seemed like he was home today and tomorrow he was reported missing over Germany . It like to broke the old man 's heart . He used to kid with the girls at the factory . Not any more . He went up and saw the boy 's wife and told her . We asked him over at headquarters how she took it . He said , ' She did n't say anything at all . ' I guess she did n't know the old man real well . Since then he got a letter from somebody supposed to be in the boy 's squadron , and they claim they saw him land safely . So the old man thinks maybe the boy 's a prisoner . The old man 's hopes have come up pretty much since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action . Usually the Union officials send a letter to the man 's family . Crago said , " Once ? the first time ? we sent flowers . We found out later it was the worst thing we could do . Another thing , flowers , you ca n't keep them . But a letter you can . " Outside the rain began again . It washed down the dark , dingy walls of the Hotel Roberts . The lobby was empty when I went in . The elevator operator , an old man , was dozing on a stool . Upstairs , from my fifth-floor window , you could see the railroad tracks glistening beneath a single street light . On the south side of the tracks , invisible tonight from the hotel , were the homes of the workers . On the north side of town the rain fell on the homes of the business people . Up the tracks a way the graveyard shift was making munitions in the bright-lit factories , islands of light in the night . Except for the factories the city on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees on the courthouse lawn the morning sun lit up the huge white billboard on which were lettered the names of local men in the armed forces . In front of the billboard was a tablet-andboulder dedicated to the memory of the eleven Revolutionary War soldiers buried in Delaware County . Inside the courthouse , on the first floor , was the county agent , Myron Cromer , a small , spare , dry man with a deliberate , orotund way of speaking . Like most people in Muncie , Mr. Cromer arrives at his office before 8 A.M. When I saw it , it was cluttered with scientific agriculture leaflets . Purdue University 's influence has been great in Indiana , especially in the rich farmland in the northern part of the state . Although Delaware County lies outside the famous black-dirt region of Indiana , its soil is rich , its crops diversified . But corn and hogs ? that is the base . The farms average perhaps ninety acres , though many are much larger . Nearly all look prosperous , with painted barns and mended fences . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleavage from its hinterland is sharp ; but the farms impinge on Muncie , for it is also a marketing center , and many Muncie people , including industrial workers , originally came from the farms . " The farmers , " said Cromer , sitting on the edge of his chair , " are much exercised over not being able to get any help . " It is the old conflict of farm against city , dramatized in wartime by soaring industrial wages , increased farm production quotas , broken irreplaceable farm machinery , the empty room where the hired hand slept before he went off to war . A hired hand who is married ? " and Selective Service has got all the single ones " ? is paid about $100 a month , " plus keep , " compared to $40 a few years ago . There are few takers . Today a farm hand must get a release from the county agent before he can leave the farm . But by the time this measure came the farmers were mad at the city and the government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Muncie boys ) were being taught to milk , to manure , to feed the hogs , to clean out the chicken house , and so to release the farmer for the fields . During summer vacation most of them would work in groups . A few would go individu ally as " live-in " boys , junior hired hands . Some might run tractors , though care must be exercised here : mechanical replacements were scarce . But these boys , only thirteen or fourteen , could not do such heavy work as making hay . So the farmers were planning to help one another . In 1944 the late , wet spring produced a seeding bottleneck . As soon as one man 's land became ready to work , you would see his neighbors moving in to help him , just as , later , he in his turn would help them . " It 's the only way out . " Co-operation is nothing new here : its history goes back to pioneer days , and on this firm groundwork rest the thriving producers ' creamery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which , organized in 1930 , supplied about 1,800 of the county 's 2,800 farmers in 1944 . I was told that dairying was in a mess . Production quotas were up , help was scarce , milking machines were scarce , and the draft took the milk companies ' truck drivers , the strong young men needed to heft the ten-gallon cans . So the farmers were mad at the draft boards . They were mad at Washington because it cried aloud for more eggs ( when feed came high ) , then let the price drop and implored people to eat eggs ; because it screamed for hogs , then could n't handle the carcasses at the packing houses ; because it wanted mountains of tomatoes for the armed forces , but took away the labor needed for this high-labor crop . The farmers are making more money than they have made for many years . Farm land values have been rising at the rate of about 1 per cent per month for the last couple of years , said Cromer , and land is worth anywhere from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the older farmers , remembering the last wartime boom , are cautious ( and their sons are in the Army ) . They feel that prices will continue high for only two or three years after the war , so they are paying off their mortgages and bracing themselves for the smashup . " Postwar world affairs ? " said Cromer . " I have not heard anybody mention world affairs for weeks or months . The farmer is too busy to worry about things like that . " O N A WALL in the office of the Muncie Chamber of Commerce hangs a slick air map of the world . But on another wall hangs a map of Muncie , much larger and showing evidence of much more use . And Lester C. Bush , the Chamber manager , told me , " We want to avoid foreign entanglements . Of course we ca n't stand for somebody who 's a rabid isolationist ? that 's foolishness , like being an ostrich . But we 've got to watch the other nations or they 'll get the big end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war but we do n't want to stick our neck out so far that they 'll be telling us what to do . We 've gone pretty far already . We do n't want to be called Uncle Shylock again . I doubt whether we 'll get a nickel of our money back . I 've heard that Russia is paying for Lend-Lease ; if it 's true , they 're gentlemen . " Bush thought that Stalin was " the world 's greatest leader today . " He suggested that , if Stalin was less than frank with the United States and England , " maybe it 's because he do n't think so much of our leaders . " He said he " hated " communism " as much as anybody " but he thought the Communists had abandoned their efforts to proselytize the world and that we could " get along with Russia after the war , " provided , of course , that the Russians " leave us alone . Any people ought to be entitled to any form of government they want . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1944 the United States Chamber of Commerce sent to its members a ballot containing seven propositions which tended to commit the United States to a leading position in postwar world affairs . Bush thought the members of the Muncie Chamber exhibited a lively interest . But another man said , " They talked about the world awhile , then they got bored and said , ' Let 's approve it . ' It was easier than arguing . " In voting " yes , " the Muncie Chamber appended a note : " We do not want superimposed upon us , by any centralized world authority , any central state that will direct . . . our . . . affairs . In our international dealings we should always be motivated by what is good for America . " Bush , a friendly man who calls strangers by their first names when he meets them , said he was beginning to think that Churchill " is just a big bag of wind . He has served his time and purpose . And so 's the boy down in the White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peter out like Wilson . I do n't think we 're being told the truth about his physical condition . And what if Wallace got in ? " This same man in May of 1939 had written in a letter : " I do not think there will be a war in Europe for some time to come , unless the United States is again foolish enough to stick its nose into other people 's Europe 's business . " We lost thousands of men , maimed other thousands and lost , up to date , 12 billions of dollars plus interest , for no good purpose at all . . . . I am not interested in wars between Germany and Russia . . . nor am I interested in any possible wars between England and Germany or France and Germany . If they want to go to war , it 's their affair . " In his large office Bush was always calling in his secretary and asking her to bring him statistics or publicity handouts , and he was surrounded by ringing telephones and plans for " drives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chair behind his big shiny desk , and suddenly his guard came down and he said , " I will tell you the truth . We are all scared to death . " The war , Russia , events in that outside world beyond Muncie ? all these have shaken somewhat the confidence he felt in 1939 . " But I hate to hear people talking about going back to the good old days . When were the good old days ? MAGAZINE In the late twenties there Were men walking the streets of Muncie out of work . Not today . We want to keep everybody at work , like they are now . We want to be ready for that evil day . " " You think there 's going to be a bust-up after the war ? " " Do n't you ? " When Bush turned from world affairs to speak of Muncie , he spoke with more confidence and enthusiasm . The city had simply expanded its old factories . Many of them were producing nearly the same products as in peacetime ? auto transmissions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shock of reconversion should be light . " We wanted it that way , " Bush said complacently . " We did n't want a lot of fly-by-night war plants and a big new floating population that might be out of work when the war ended . " But other business men have said that Muncie scrambled like most other cities to get new war plants but failed . Bush said that Muncie was slow to start on war work but " Today there is n't a single square foot of idle factory floor-space in town . " Bush said that , to take up the unemployment slack during the brief postwar retooling period , a committee was planning a tri-city airport ( six airlines have applied to the Civil Aeronautics Board for permission to fly to Muncie ) , a construction program for streets , schools , county buildings , a sewage system , houses , and apartments . " But where is the money coming from ? Nobody knows . " Maybe the federal government will help . But what about the federal debt ? In Muncie there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employing more than three thousand workers are Warner Gear , Durham Manufacturing , Chevrolet and Delco-Remy divisions of General Motors , and the Bali Brothers Company . It has been claimed that " The Balls own Muncie . " One informed man said recently , " The town is getting away from them ; it is getting too big for them . They never did mess around in politics any more than they had to . " They got in on the ground floor of Muncie 's first and only big boom . In the 1890 's , after natural gas was discovered in northeastern Indiana , numerous cities boomed overnight . The cheap fuel was peculiarly adapted to glass-making . The Ball brothers made millions out of jars for home canning . They moved to power : banks , railroads , real estate , retail stores , manufacturing plants , national Republican politics , newspapers , a brewery , oil in Texas , and oil pipe in Pennsylvania . They became pillars of the church , the Chamber of Commerce , the Y.M.C.A. , the local college ( through their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College ) . They were the solid rock to which Muncie clung during the depression of the 1930 's . Their plant was , in 1944 , one of the three last large plants in town to be without a CIO contract . Union men have said the Balls pay the lowest wages in town and fight the union the hardest . Business men referred to Frank C. Ball , the eldest of the five brothers , who died last year at eighty-five , simply as " Mr. F. C. " George A. Ball was the only one of the original five brothers still living in April of 1944. qN is signed page-one column in the Evening Press , Wilbur Sutton , the editor , wrote , " Talked to a Muncie young fellow who is going away to the wars and who has two kids . . . . He said ' I do n't give a nickel for Russia , Great Britain , China , nor any other nation except us . If anybody thinks I am fighting for any other nation , he 's crazy . ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation , leaning back in his chair , " if you 're not for America first , what are you for ? " Sutton is a graying man , feet on the ground , shrewd , with a quick , broad awareness . Perhaps a disillusioned liberal , he said he himself was convinced that some sort of international organization would be needed after the war , but he doubted if many people in Muncie agreed . He said he rarely heard any talk about postwar world organization , and what talk he did hear was unfavorable . " They 're in favor of preparedness . They want to defend the American hemisphere . But to hell with everybody else . People want to get the Philippines back because they were attacked ? that part of the war is a crusade . But once they get ' em back they 'd turn ' em over to the Filipinos or anybody else who was friendly . " Another newspaperman said , " Underneath , a surprising number of people do n't think we need to be in the European war . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . But Germany did n't attack us . " Sutton said that , nevertheless , " The war is uppermost in people 's minds . It 's bound to be ; it 's affected nearly every family in the county directly . They do n't like gasoline and food rationing , but they do n't kick much . They just want to get the war over with in a hurry . They 'd make any sacrifice to do that . When will the war end ? One prominent bartender said last summer it would end by Armistice Day of 1943 . People have stopped guessing now . " Sutton had been a Wink man , and he thought Willkie 's chances for election had been good . ( Although this is Willkie 's home district , he lost Delaware County in 1940 , though he carried Indiana by a narrow margin . ) Sutton said that people in Muncie backed Willkie " just because he is so goddam honest . ' Another man said it was simply " a matter of home-town pride . " As for his speeches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any attention to what Wendell said . Wendell always did do a lot of talking , but nobody listened to him much . " Sutton believed that anybody who ran against Roosevelt would draw support from all farmers , most business men , and at least half of labor . The farmers were especially bitter , he said . They liked Bricker , considered Dewey a New Yorker . Sutton noted among the professional politicians ? but not among the people ? surprising support for Hoover . " But in the same breath they say Hoover would n't have a chance . " Many of the editorials in both Muncie newspapers deal with corn kings , traffic accidents , and similar matters . When they touch on international affairs they frequently are mere resumes of news . But the Press of September 25 , 1943 , said editorially that Roosevelt was interested in " putting over upon the American people the belief that his continued presidency is necessary for the success of the war effort . . . he will become , under whatever name it may be disguised , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan and do n't fool yourself about it . " The editorial suggested that postwar world reorganization should await victory . The Morning Star , in which one of the Balls held an interest , said editorially , just after Pearl Harbor , " The attack answers all the arguments that have been advanced by the isolationists , the appeasers . . . . " A few days later : " No division of politics or of class remains . " A year later : " The sugar , gasoline , and fuel oil rationing was imposed by methods more reminiscent of Gestapo edicts than the American system . . . . The entire population is wholeheartedly behind the war effort but it is still sick at heart to see how needed efficiency is retarded by retention of the same old New Deal theorists and starry-eyed dreamers . " A few days later : " There must be an end to bureaucracy and a return to the fundamental principles . . . . " One newspaperman said , " They try to make the editorials follow public opinion ? not lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and especially for the middle class , he said that the people never talked about international affairs in ordinary social conversation , that they thought " Roosevelt got us into the war , " that they were anti-Churchill and anti-Roosevelt , that they were tired of the war and wanted to get it over with and get the best out of a bad deal . He said he thought Willkie 's withdrawal would not change the 1944 political decision : any Republican would get a big anti-Roosevelt vote . Muncie normally is Republican . But of course Muncie also is normally conservative , and today Muncie is afraid , and this might produce a strong don't-change-horses vote . Above all , Muncie is interested only in Muncie . MHE taxi left the shopping district and headed out a broad street lined with trees whose branches interlaced to form a canopy overhead . Fine homes stood be-hind the trees , but only five minutes farther on we crossed the tracks and there was the factory , one of the biggest in Muncie , a long , low , glass-and-brick building . Near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and motorcycles were parked , but now , as the shift changed at 3:30 P.M. , it became plain that most of the workers still drove automobiles : men and women streamed out of the plant and their cars clogged the streets for blocks around . Inside , at a desk in his cramped office , with light coming eerily through the glass-brick walls , an official of the company said , " Muncie is for America first and the reason is that we are ninety-eight per cent American born and foreign troubles are n't real to us . We did n't want the war . When France fell , France was a long way off . So was England . They still are . We did n't want to make weapons of destruction but we had to . We will be glad in Muncie when we can go back to making things for peace , useful things . Postwar does not mean international problems at all . Postwar means getting a job or a contract in Muncie . " This man was active in the task of re-employing veterans of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty such men . All but one found jobs without much difficulty . This company official felt that the CIO contract provided adequately for veterans . Under it a man drafted retains his seniority at the factory during his service in the armed forces . Returning , he is to be given preference . " Of course , if there is nothing open at his seniority level he will get no consideration . " TN THE window of the Polly Parrot Res-it taurant I saw a " waitress wanted " sign , a common sight all over town . Housemaids , formerly to be had for $3 or $4 a week , are virtually unprocurable at $25 . Rents are frozen ? $35 for a bedroom apartment in an excellent part of town ? but there are no vacancies . One man had hunted a house unsuccessfully for a year and a half . Even attics are scarce . People who had " doubled up " during the depression now can afford homes of their own . Muncie 's population has grown by only about 2,500 since the prewar defense boom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25,000 . The explanation : war took up the unemployed slack ; women went into factories . In January , 1943 , Muncie officially had a labor surplus . A little over a year later it was a Class I critical area and the local office of the U. S. Employment Service was one of the busiest places in town . Virtually all industrial hiring was done there . In the beginning , workingmen resented having to go to the U.S.E.S . o ffice ? " I never needed no help from anybody to get a job . " The U.S.E.S . office is long and narrow . Behind the counter at the front are rows of desks ; here the interviewers work . Back of them are the desks of the personnel men from the larger factories . One of these , a big red-faced man with small but friendly eyes , said to me , " I have a pretty easy time selling men on the idea of coming to work for us because my plant will be in a good position for postwar reconversion . A man that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're strictly a war plant , and what his seniority 'll be after the war . " ( Another man interested in personnel work corroborated this but added , " They 'll still throw over their seniority for higher pay . They figure the war is going to last at least another year and a half , and that extra ten cents an hour looks good to them . " ) " Internationalism ? No ; all they 're interested in is a job here after the war . Oh , you hear some of them say things are going to be different when the boys come home , but I do n't know what they mean and I doubt if they do either , " and he smiled indulgently . " Some of them think the soldiers will resent the strikes that have been going on some places . But then others say that the war 's being fought for the workingman so they 'd better get all they can now , while the getting 's good . You hear some of them ? just a few , mind you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the election 's over . They think they 've been taken for a ride by the Administration . " His colleague thought , that most workingmen in Muncie were still in the Roosevelt column , " although both Roosevelt and John L. Lewis lost prestige by fighting between themselves . " A little man sat down beside the desk . He lived at Newcastle , twenty miles away . He wanted one of those hundred-dollar-aweek jobs he 'd heard about . The personnel man said he did n't have one for him " right now " but offered him eighty-three cents an hour and urged , " We 've got a good bunch of fellows out there to work with ; I 'm sure you 'll enjoy working out there . " The man asked if he could get transferred to a higher-paying job later on . The personnel man told him , " It 's possible , but I do n't like to make any promises to a man even if I lose him . " He continued , " We teach a man not to be just part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read blueprints , grind tools . Two years ' experience with us is worth six or seven most places . We use the point system , too a modified Bedaux system . " He also offered to help arrange transportation from Newcastle . The man finally accepted the job . The labor shortage forced this plant to hire women for the first time , but " Women arc a liability in some ways . At least half of them quit . We 've asked the men to take the heavy jobs and leave the lighter ones to the women . We give preference to war widows of former employees . A lot of women are taking their husbands ' jobs after their husbands have gone into the Army ; they expect to go back to housekeeping after the war . " Absenteeism recently had been attacked by a Chamber of Commerce publicity campaign . " I doubt if the campaign did any good . What most people do n't realize is that all absenteeism is n't willful . Oh , sure , there 's always the same few that get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot more that do n't come to work because of wartime strains . The war is starting to come home to them .

He was their only boy ; they 'd lost two other children ; he was always a home boy , did n't run around much nights . After he was drafted his dad tried to go on working but he got so he could n't work nights or days either ; he just kind of went crazy . Finally he quit . You ca n't run a campaign against that . " . PAYNE 'S Restaurant at noon was jammed ; the hostess seated me at a table already occupied by two young business men . Their talk was of personal matters , of the late spring , of gasoline restrictions ( " I would n't kick if I thought rationing really was necessary " ) , but not of politics or world affairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tracks where the workingmen ate . Crops , the shop , victory gardens , the family , the house ( " Thank God they froze the rent on us " ) , a boy they knew who now was in the Army ? those were the things they talked about at the crowded tables . Late in the afternoon the workers on the day shift came into the Pig Stand . Ed Crago sat in a little booth and talked about the history of labor in Muncie . He is president of the Delaware County Industrial Union Council , which includes thirty-two locals , most of them ? but not all ? auto and steel workers ' unions . Crago , a soft-spoken educated young labor leader who works for Chevrolet , claimed 16,000 members for the CIO in Delaware County , not including men in the armed forces , Muncie for years had a bad reputation among labor men . " This was a scab town until the CIO came in , " one labor man recalled . " Now it 's almost 100 per cent organized . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant , labor men claimed , Pinkerton operatives had been hired by management to pose as regular employees and find out who was active in the union . At the Chevrolet plant , after an involved controversy , the company union struck and the CIO broke the strike in a bloody riot in the spring of 1938 . " It was brutal . When it was over the company union was through and we were in . " The CIO grew rapidly . " Now we get along with everybody in town . Take the American Legion . The last three post commanders have been CIO men . We co-operate on the war finance committee and all other civic enterprises . There 's hardly a prominent man in the city that I have n't had dealings with in the past six months . I found out thatsome of them are n't as reactionary as I 'd thought . The CIO is accepted everywhere . " But a man who moves among business men and hears them talk said , " The CIO is not accepted in Muncie . It is tolerated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and management knows it . " Confronted with this , Crago said , " We know there are some reactionaries /eft . " And a hard-bitten old-time union organizer said , " Sure we 're accepted ? now . Wait until after the war , wait till hard times come again . They 'll throw us out in the gutter ? if they can . But they ca n't . " Crago finished his beer and the waitress brought two more . Only two brands were available . Crago spoke to a workingman who came in , then said , " The average workingman in Muncie today is probably making sixty or sixty-five a week . At Warner Gear , with incentive pay , the average might be seventy to a hundred . " Whenever he mentioned a figure Crago wrote it down on a piece of paper that he laid beside the beer bottle . Doodling . " The workingman has a lot of expenses nowadays most people do n't realize , " and he ticked them off on his fingers : " Red Cross , taxes , bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ( The dues of most locals are a dollar a month . ) Unlike a number of business men , Crago did n't think increased taxes had turned workingmen against the Administration . " You hear them say , ' In Iots of countries the workingman do n't make enough to pay taxes . ' Oh , sometimes they get a little sore about things . Take the fellow up at the Board ? he 's supposed to make the decision but you tell him about your work and he does n't know what you 're talking about . But , by and large , you ask will they vote for Roosevelt ? Sure they will . Personally , " he added , " I 'm sure we 've got to have some kind of international organization . We need the world markets . " He smiled . " But in the locker rooms and the washrooms you never hear the men talking about things like that . They just plain are n't interested . " The woman in the black dress who sold tip-books strolled past the booth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Postwar re-employment can be worked out very smoothly if there 's a plan . I think most of our contracts are adequate . But all the contracts specify that a man ' in good health ' is to get preference . What about a handicapped man , a man that was wounded ? That 's where the reactionaries are going to get in their licks . " Men will have it over these women who 've taken their jobs . The plants do n't like women . One plant took what it thought was the lesser of two evils ? Negroes , not women . But that wo n't make any problem after the war ? most white men wo n't take the jobs that Negroes have . The poor guys , those Negroes have got some pretty lousy jobs . " Muncie 's race problem seemed dangerous . In early April a Negro was accused of raping a white woman . That night in the saloons there was no lynch talk but there was what might be called pre-lynch talk . You heard that " at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raping a white woman in Muncie " ( an exaggeration ) ; that " a while back things got so tight that Chevrolet had to let its white workers out by one door and its niggers out by another " ( untrue ) ; " a fifth of the total population 's nigger " ( one-twentieth would appear more accurate ) . The newspapers , recognizing danger in the situation , kept rape stories off page one . One Negro who had lived in Muncie forty years said , " There would n't be any trouble but for a few bad colored people and a few bad white folks from Tennessee . " Race prejudice is nothing new in Indiana . The Klan grew fat on it in the early 1920 's . Muncie was a Klan hotbed . This Negro said the Klan was dead now but " it still has lots of sympathizers . " The wartime labor shortage gave new opportunities to many Negroes . " But they 'll spend all their bonds and then they wo n't have anything . Then the war ends and the depression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . C RAGO said , " I do n't want any more beer . I ca n't drink much beer . Come on up to headquarters and talk to some of the boys . " Limping from theeffects of an accident several years ago , he led the way out of the Pig Stand and across Walnut Street , and up a flight of wooden stairs in a business block . Nearly all the second floor was occupied by union headquarters . " Fresh paint " signs hung on the wet yellow walls . Out in the corridors a dozen or so workingmen were standing around and talking . They were waiting for a meeting to begin . One of them , a young fellow , was being kidded because though he had passed his armed forces pre-induction physical he had not yet been inducted . Somebody asked Crago when he was going into the Army and he said , " My number 's coming up in June . " Later he explained , " I do n't intend to ask for an occupational deferment . I 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( This was a fairly common attitude ; some workers refused to tell the boss what board they were registered with , thus preventing him from getting them deferred . ) The men talked about friends , families , jobs , plans for the CIO softball team . Asked if he heard much talk about postwar international organization , one man said , " Of course not . " Another said , " If I do it goes in one ear and out the other . " Not one displayed any interest in such matters . All said , grinning , that they intended to vote for Roosevelt . But they disavowed any deep interest in political matters . " We 'll vote for Roosevelt because we 're interested in our jobs . " In the headquarters office was a member of the CIO Political Action Committee , an intellectual , a professional labor politician , tall , thin , vocal . " As Murray says , why shoot mosquitoes when there are elephants to shoot ? To hell with the county officers ? Congress is what matters . Roosevelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years and what 've we got ? The Smith-Connally bill is still on the statute books . The greatest liberal in the world is n't any good if Congress is against him . " He sat in an overstuffed chair beside a desk , his long legs dangling over one arm of the chair . On a couch opposite sat a chunky young woman in a red dress , a worker at Ball 's . In the doorway stood Crago and an older man , president of one of the locals , an old-time labor man who had grown up in Muncie . The Political Action man lit a cigarette and blew smoke carefully at the ceiling . " We 've got our battlegrounds narrowed for the election this year and we 're going to make a real showing . We may not win but we 're going to scare hell out of a lot of people . " Crago grinned . " In 1940 we rang doorbells and took ' em to the polls . What time you want to go to the polls , lady ? ' We worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a four-thousand Democratic majority . We can do it again . We 've got to . " AFTER the meeting , the old-time labor man and the girl in the red dress went across the street through the dark and rain to the Pig Stand . The windows were steamed over ; the place was crowded . The grizzled labor man , broad-shouldered , gentle of speech , humble but determined , seemed out of place in the Pig Stand , with its young workingmen , its juke box , its red-leather-upholstered booths . He hunched his shoulders and put his elbows on the table and said , " I can remember the streetcar strike here in 1900 . There was n't any union . They were just men getting twelve and a half cents an hour and they got fed up and struck . They got beat up and they lost the strike . That broke labor in Muncie until the CIO came in . I can remember when I worked for Ball for a five-dollar gold piece and four silver dollars a week . Fifty-four hours a week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my girl friend to the show at the Columbia ? it 's tore down now for fifteen cents . " He ordered a beer for himself and a whisky and coke for the girl in red . She listened to him with respect . He was gray-haired . He clasped his gnarled hands on the table . " I was up at East Chicago making a speech when Little Steel happened , and I was in the Guide Lamp trouble at Anderson , and I was at Richmond too . Richmond was the worst . You know , after a while we find out we 've got to fight for everything we get . If we wanta tell the boss we do n't like the way things are going , how can we , unlesswe fight for it ? That 's not communism , " he said earnestly , " or socialism or anything else . I voted for Hoover and for Landon just like everybody else in Muncie before I finally got some sense in my head and voted for Roosevelt in 1940 . It took me all those years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard the fella say two chickens in every pot and two cars in every garage but I never seen it . It took me a long time to see which side my bread was buttered on . I 've got to see it , because there 's too many people that do n't know the other side just do n't butter bread . " His brown suit seemed too small for him ; he moved uneasily while he spoke , and his voice had become intense . " Take it easy , " the girl said , kindly . " Show him that telegram , " the man told her . " Oh , that . That do n't amount to much . " " Show it to him anyway . " From her purse she drew a folded telegram . In it the CIO urged Indiana legislators , then assembled in special session , to approve a bill permitting soldiers to use the short federal ballot . ( The Republican majority subsequently defeated the bill . ) The old labor man said , " You see ? We watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard that fellow say , we may not win but we 're going to scare hell out of a lot of people . The soldiers have got a right to vote . What are they going to come home to ? Listen . I was in the last war . I got home January 21 , 1919 , and I got my first job January 3 , 1920 . Almost a year . They would n't even talk to me . Some guy had got my job while I was in the Army . " The girl said she wanted another drink . He apologized for neglecting her and called the waitress . The juke box was quiet for a minute , and when he spoke again he spoke too loudly and was embarrassed . " Well , what are the boys coming home to this time ? I 'll tell you . Our contracts , the CIO contracts , have got to take care of them . Because the boss never will . We 're the only ones will give them a break . " The girl in the red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look at the mess I 'm in . " , She was sore because she was frozen to her job at Ball 's , where , she claimed , she made only 48% cents , and could not take a job at Warner , where she would start at 85 . " And an appeal takes longer than the sixty-day waiting period . " The man was silent a moment . Then : " What about the average workingman , the men up there at the bar ? are they thinking like you are about world affairs , about the political future ? " He looked at them , at their backs as they stood three-deep . He laughed . He said , " Five years ago they could buy a hog 's head and five pounds of beans and that 's all . Now they can eat a dollar-and-a-quarter steak . A man can make a hundred and fifteen dollars a week and so can his wife . What the hell do you expect them to think about ? They think about spending it . " He said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them with us anyway . ' . ; IT WAS almost train time . Outside , the .11. rain was coming down hard . As I walked from the Roberts to the depot behind the bellhop carrying the luggage , it was easy to remember 1939 , when Muncie had been strongly isolationist except for a few labor leaders . The Lynds , the sociologists , in 1935 had noted an inward-turning which , present in Muncie ten years earlier , seemed to have been intensified by the depression . The war appears to have built the fences even higher . In 1939 , some of the workers had developed a hate-Hitler feeling . By 1944 most of that had disappeared . Perhaps some business men were less isolationist than in 1939 , but not many . Labor leaders talked international affairs in 1944 but the rank and file did not . Fear of the future was almost the single common denominator . " To get the war over with and to get back to Muncie " ? that seemed a fair summary . Isolationism , internationalism ? those were labels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muncie was a fact . Therefore it appealed strongly to Hoosiers , who consider themselves shrewd , hard-headed realists . It always has been hard to hang labels on maverick Hoosiers . In the spring of 1944 they seemed headed toward postwar isolationism . But they were not thinking about it much and so perhaps they could be led in some other direction . ( For example one could see also fertile ground ? made fertile by intense nationalism ? for imperialism . ) Domestic politics ? The lines seemed drawn already . There was a strong anti-Roosevelt vote among business men which would go to any Republican . The workers , pulled alike by their progressive leaders and their own instinctive conservatism , seemed safe for Roosevelt providing that the war continued into November of 1944 . The CIO might well hold the balance of power . Governor Henry Schricker , the only state Democrat elected in the 1940 Republican sweep in Indiana , will run for the Senate ; his personal following is tremendous ( but every vote for Schricker may not be a vote for Roosevelt : scratch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the railroad station a crowd was waiting for the train . A man and woman sat uncomfortable with their son in Army uniform between them . Obviously they were seeing him off to those wars outside of Muncie . They were all dressed up . None of the three talked much , and the others waiting for the train avoided looking at them , as people avoid staring at a cripple . Far away in the rainy night the train whistled , long and lonely . At the station people picked up their suitcases and satchels and brown-wrapped parcels and went out onto the platform . The train came from Cleveland , from the East , a long way off . It was headed for Indianapolis and for St. Louis , but it was a local and it would stop at several other Indiana small towns . The train came alongside the station and the conductor and Pullman porters got off and stood waiting . Almost all the Muncie passengers got into the coaches . Nobody but the soldier was going far .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
