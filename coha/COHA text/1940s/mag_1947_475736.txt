IT SHOULD be time once again for the young men who write to wash their hands of America , to begin hopping cattle boats or any outbound tramp steamer that will take them away from this land of ignorance , unculture , and aesthetic starvation . Once again they should be flocking to Europe , staking out claims in Paris and the south of France , piling saucers on the tops of cafe tables , going to the bull fights in Spain ; or , if Europe is still too badly wrecked to offer them a haven , flocking to the Big Sur , to Taos , or to Province town , there to detach themselves with almost equal completeness from American life and to write good books about sick America . The critics , reviewers , scholars , and other weathermen of letters are keeping an expectant eye on the heavens and awaiting just this sort of change in the literary climate . They know that only the appearance of better books can break the present drought , and they believe , logically enough , that only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some artistic Holy Land , can these better books be written . They know the circumstances which contributed to the violentliterary upheaval and fecundity of the twenties ; and as they look about them they are able to find enough similarity between those circumstances and present ones to make the end they desire seem inevitable . The country has again come through a major world war and is again experiencing the profoundly disturbing aftereffects of war . The times are again right for a reexamination of values , and if need be , for a revolt from old values . Once more there is business prosperity , and as luxury products reappear on the market it may reach proportions far exceeding the prosperity of the twenties . The young men should have , on an average , more money today ? enough , with saving , to finance a trip . Since the war it has been easier to break into print than it has been for the past decade . In consequence , the books that the young men might write will have less chance of lying neglected in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps , hundreds of thousands of men along with their families have been uprooted from home grounds and scattered all over the country and the world . The opportunities for absorbing foreign cultures , for finding stimulation in foreign intellectual movements have never been greater . The young men have once again the rare and invaluable advantage of a foreign perspective , of a point of reference from which to examine the civilization of their own country . If we read the critical histories and eyewitness accounts of the twenties , we find much the same factors listed as the major causes of the " lostness " of its literary gencration , and of their admirable creative productivity . Those earlier young men were also disassociated from place , uprooted from native grounds , brought into contact with foreign ( specifically European ) ideas , . forced to exchange peacetime values for the more profligate values of war , and creatively and emotionally awakened by danger and the nearness of death . Would it not be correct to assume then that , given such a similarity of experience , the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I , as one member of the new generation , believe not ; and the factor which seems to me to outweigh all the similarities is inherent in a basic difference of attitude and response . mosr of the writers who began moving into Montparnasse in the early twenties had been through the war . In one capacity or another , whether with the American Ambulance Services serving with the French , with the Red Cross Ambulance Sections on the Italian front , or in the various branches of the combat army after America entered the war , they had nearly all undergone the same experiences , had similar emotional responses , arrived at about the same conclusions . Their military careers , like their lives , followed a surprisingly identical pattern . Like most young men of their generation , they were deeply and sentimentally affected by the patriotic slogans and catchwords that are so much the vogue of wartime , and they left college and jobs to find , in what seemed a glorious adventure , relief from boredom and a cause worthy of belief . Behind them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York and Boston , they left conventional boyhoods in small towns and cities , conventional training in high schools and preparatory schools where they were equipped with the same attitudes , ignorances , and prejudices , and conventional furbishings in colleges and universities where they were allowed the same privileges , endowed with the same snobberies , exposed to the same English verse . Ahead of them lay Europe with its promises of love , excitement , freedom ; the Europe they knew for its women , its paintings , its books , its Paris ; the Europe they knew only from steamship folders , novels , and picture postcards . What the war should have taught these young men it somehow failed to teach them . Although it took away their illusions , it did not destroy their capacity to enjoy disillusion . They fought in it and some of their friends died in it ; yet they were still somehow capable of being thrilled by danger and the prospect of giving blood for their country , stricken to a fierce exaltation by the simple poignancy of death among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ruins of a French chateau . A fair explanation for their enjoyment of disillusion may perhaps be found in the nature of the war service of many of these men . Working as they did with units attached to foreign armies , they were able to retain their status of American gentlemen volunteers and with it most of their civilian privileges . As strangers among strangers , they were treated with respect . They were outside the petty restrictions imposed upon the officers and men of a regular military organization , and owing to the nature of their work and a relaxed , almost nonexistent , discipline , they were able to mix in comparative freedom with the civilian population . Out of such war experience grew what Malcolm Cowley , one of the most honest observers of the time , has called " the spectatorial attitude . " In his book , Exile 's Return , he tells how , while watching a column of men belonging to many Allied nationalities moving through a French village , he and other members of his ambulance unit felt that they " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parade of races was a spectacle which it was our privilege to survey , a special circus like the exhibition of Moroccan horsemen given for our benefit on the Fourth of July . " To such observers the war was something apart , a spectacle it was their " privilege to survey . " In the words of a Dos Passos character , it was n't a war , it was " a goddam Cook 's tour . " It was an exhibition in violence and destruction , a gigantic bullfight one was privileged to view from the stands . And when it became a bit too rough or too bloody or just too dull , there were always new and exciting places to go , new and exciting drinks to sample , new and exciting girls to fall in love with . This " spectatorial attitude " was contagious ; and while it proved to be excellent equipment for young writers , it served to sever more completely the ties that held them to the war and to their country . It served to carry toward completion the long process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the standardization of their customs and beliefs , and continued through their college years when each took on the stamp of pseudoculture which made him indistinguishable from all the rest . Now in the middle of a war of which they were guests by courtesy of the management , infected with irresponsibility , danger , held to a pitch of excitement that made their old lives seem impossibly dull and tiresome , they were indeed " lost , " lost from home , sanity , and themselves . F Rom this sense of isolation , of thrilled but detached observance , it was easy for the young men to take the next logical step ? active , conscious revolt and self-exile from a country which was neither gay enough nor cultured enough to deserve their presence . Conveniently , a formal philosophical structure for such sentiments had been shaping itself both before and during the war years in the writings of certain prominent social-literary critics of American life , among them H. L. Mencken and Van Wyck Brooks . For a number of years , these men had been expressing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a machine-made , standardized society . It seemed to them that life in America was tawdry , cheap , colorless , and given over to the exclusive warship of wealth and machinery ; that for a young writer to do his best work in such a society was impossible . In 1921 , Harold Stearns ' symposium , Civilization m the United Slates , gave these attitudes detailed and scholarly expansion . The thirty intellectuals whom Stearns had gathered together examined in essay form as many phases of American life and came up with the same conclusions : life in America for the individual with creative talent is not worth living . If the young artist is to escape with his talent unimpaired , he must leave the country . He must , as Stearns urged in his essay , go to Europe where the creative life is still possible . To show that he meant it , Stearns left for France soon after his book was delivered to the publisher , and whether because of his example or not , the young men followed . Most of us know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was complete . The young men came to Paris . With their wives and children , cats and typewriters , they settled in flats and studios along the Left Bank and in the Latin Quarter . They took jobs as foreign correspondents for American newspapers , sent back social gossip and racing news ; wrote book reviews , magazine articles , and stories ; bet on horses , gambled , borrowed , and begged ; did anything to keep alive and to prolong the show . If we can believe the stories , they were drunk much of the time , traveled considerably , and had very many love affairs . They also managed to get an impressive amount of good writing done . The early work of Fitzgerald , Dos Passos , Hemingway , Cummings , and others bears witness to the fact . Between times , when they were not drinking at the cafes , partying , writing , or making love , they talked a lot and did a certain amount of thinking . At about this time , some of them discovered Gertrude Stein , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her guidance . It was she , perhaps more than any other , who taught them how to make the most of their " lostness , " how to develop , along with Sherwood Anderson , an idiom that would be true of their time and truly their own . Then , as the new writing began to appear , new little magazines began springing up to accommodate it . Their titles , Broom , transition , This Quarter , Secession , were indicative of their editorial policies . Everywhere the accent was on the new and different , the departure from old forms and techniques , the rebellion . The machinery of art was grinding away at full speed , turning out new morals and literary mannerisms as conventionalized , ironically enough , as those which they were intended to supplant . Then something in the mechanism snapped , and the machine began running down . Back home in Wall Street , among the debris of ticker tape and ruined fortunes , lay the remnants of a broken promise , the promise everybody had made to everybody else ? that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the roaring business boom of the twenties came the end of the roaring exile of its artists . The small private incomes from securities , the monthly checks from the folks , the publisher 's advances toward the writing of the next book , were abruptly sliced in half ; then , gradually , they ceased coming altogether . Job contracts ran out and somehow failed to be renewed . For the first time the actors , escape-artists , clowns , and special guests whose sole function it was to be slightly amused were faced with the choice of stopping the show or starving . Actually , there was no choice ; it had already been made for them . They began quietly packing their bags and drifting toward Marseilles and Cherbourg . A few chose to remain , the ones whose investments in Paradise had grown too large to abandon . Harold Stearns grimly stuck it out and was making the rounds of the cafes in search of his missing friends years after the friends had gone home . He took to wearing borrowed clothes and making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for long periods was painfully and lonesomely blind . His story in his autobiography , Streets I Know , is the story of the end of an era and of one man 's realization , too late , of his own folly . When compared with his bitter indictment of America in Civilization in the United States it becomes sad , embarrassing reading . One wishes that a better , more dignified end might have come to a man who felt so deeply and who wrote so well , and to a time which promised so much , gave only a little less than it promised , and made so much difference in our lives . Yet it would be a mistake to assume that the expatriate era died solely because of the collapse of the economic system upon which it was based . It died as well because its ideals were fully and elaborately exploited and found wanting . The Lost Generation learned the hard way that the extremes of art and life lead only to spiritual bankruptcy and physical suicide . The exile which had begun as an escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a self-styled grace period for young American talent ended in another and greater sterility and in a blind alley for that talent . The ways of adventure , dream , and calculated futility that promised escape from middle-class mediocrity led instead to fanaticism , creative impotence , and anarchy . The extreme of art led to the negation of art , and the extreme of life led to death . The attitudes toward American life which had helped to form the Lost Generation could not long remain tenable after its members were forced to abandon their exile and , for better or worse , to find themselves . The country to which they returned might be colorless , materialistic , and stupid , but they had to make the best of it . There was nowhere else to go . III I HAVE said that the main difference between the Lost Generation and the present generation is a difference of attitude and response , that while the physical circumstances of their experience are similar , the effects upon them of that experience differ radically . Perhaps there is still another difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did made it impossible for this generation Ours is a more knowledgeable time , certainly , and in many ways a more cynical one . Young men today are terribly aware , and in comparison with those who set out , with the eagerness of innocent boys , to save the world for democracy they seem terribly old . The illusions they might have had about war were blessedly lost for them twenty years before . They had no need far glorious adventure nor relief from boredom . Their lives , as far back as they could remember , had been spent in a world continually at war with itself , in an economic order that fluctuated from dizzy prosperity to the most abject depression . They could remember nothing but domestic unrest , fumblings at peace conferences , Asiatic invasions , and South American revolutions . They came to consciousness in the midst of breadlines , strikes , and milk riots . The generation before them found itself lost in a world it had never made . They could never be lost because the world had never been theirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did not go cynically as they very well might have , but with determination . They went believing that the world was a mess and that war was a terrible means of doing something about it . They went because they had no choice but to go and because whatever hope there might be for a future depended upon their going . T HOSE who went to Europe found exactly what they expected to find . The travel folders had been outdated before they finished high school . The novels all concerned a Europe that might as well have never been . They found themselves in a place stripped of gaiety and romance . The picturesque little villages were in ruins ; the girls were not lovely nor very eager ; the wine was gone . Whatever hopes some of them might have had of seeing the country , mixing with the civilian population , browsing in libraries and art galleries were stifled in a tightly-organized military system where no allowances were made for individual preferences and no one was treated as a gentleman . Most of them saw Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tank , and they remember it as a momentary relief from the stiff enemy resistance they had been encountering , perhaps as a dejected and slightly threadbare city where they stopped just long enough for a shot of cognac . The rest of the time , it was cold and miserable . The young men were tired and dirty . They were afraid very often and pushed beyond the limits of fatigue . The spectacle of death was not touchingly poignant nor exciting . Nobody looked on , nobody was faintly amused . The war was close and too real to be analyzed or thought about . It was a nightmare that might some day end , that might somehow be lived through . With luck , someone might get home , and if he did , he was going to tell the truth . For the first time in history , Americans were close to the truth of war , and they saw it with the clearest , most matter-offact powers of observation any generation ever had . And because they began to see the truth of war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that the earlier generation gave up so much of its youth , talent , and sanity to keep from learning . They learned that not only does war solve nothing but that it contributes to and aggravates the sickness of the world ; that its values , either as values of art or of life , are not true or honest ; and , most important of all , that there is no escape from oneself nor from the defects of one 's country . They saw that there is but one choice ? to live in the world and accept the world ? and that the religion of art , the expatriate movement , or any ideology that seeks to force a separation of art and life is not only intellectually untenable but physically impossible . They learned that art must always supplement life and draw its materials from life , and that life , whether in Europe or America , is worth living ; indeed , must be lived if it is to produce a healthy and vital art . The literature of the twenties had the vitality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed , for without it the literature of this generation would be obliged to do its job . But it was a literature written for the most part in the spirit of exile , and it has all the defects and limitations of that spirit . Today many of the most important books of the twenties seem dated , oddly limited , and often childish . They do have important lessons to teach , however , lessons in form and technique and in the realistic presentation of experience , and they must be read , studied , and understood by the young writers who hope to improve on them . Their defects are equally important , and should be carefully examined if we are to profit by them . IT Is difficult and a little embarrassing to reread Hemingway today . One wonders how the terse language , the clear descriptive passages , and the explosive dialogue that once ? not so long ago ? seemed so impressively right and so distressingly infectious , can have become so suddenly stale , can be to us now , who once were so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have discovered what Hemingway and his generation somehow failed to discover : that there is more to the world than can be expressed in monosyllables , that people do not spit their words out between clenched teeth , nor beat their environments into submission with their fists , nor live by an ethical code that admits only the emotions of brute courage , masculine assertiveness , and lust ? Perhaps . It is certainly partly that . It is also partly because we realize now that Hemingway 's is a severely limited world in which the motives of men are reduced to a simplicity our own perceptions will not allow us to approve . It is a world bound in the sensations of war . Its people exist by a jungle law and deify a pagan god . Only the fittest among them survive . They survive by virtue of their capacity for numbness and insensibility . The Robert Cohns and the other weak arc destroyed , go down disgracefully because they dare to admit their feelings . The Lady Bretts , the Jake Barneses , and the Lieutenant Henrys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hear nothing , know nothing , to insulate themselves with a good stiff drink , dope themselves with sex , relieve their emotions at bullfights , in wars , wherever blood is spilled . And the rest ? the Harry Morgans , the Robert Jordans , and the Catherine Barkleys ? are the luckiest of all . They die fighting . They are spared Jake Barnes ' life of impotence , Lady Brett 's boredom with sex , Lieutenant Henry 's penalty for desertion . They go down swinging for a cause . Yet they are people who do not like to live and die this way . They wouldlike to be different , but they lack the will power to make the attempt . Their creator would like us to believe that beneath their hard exterior shells they are soft and yielding , that if things were better they would do more thinking . But the condition of their nervous systems makes thinking fatal , he seems to say . They are victims of a lousy deal and ca n't take any responsibility for what happens to them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never quite grew up , whose growth was arrested by the war , and whose emotions could not function except under the stimulus of war . But speculations as to the kind of writer he might have become , what he might have said , fade before the fact that he is a good writer , one of the best of his generation . What the young writers have learned from him they will make their own . But his characters and their talk , their conduct , and their ethics are no longer suitable models . They are not true of our time . T HE novels of Dos Passos are not likely to embarrass us today ; they are more apt to be simply dull , a trifle tiresome . So much of what he had to say after Three Soldiers reads like case history , straight journalistic reporting of lives governed by an apathetic genie who beckons them to destruction . In his immense chronicle of the American scene , U. S. A. , Dos Passos manages to fashion a net of circumstantial evidence condemning enough to convict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that devil , no matter what disguise it may seem to wear , is nearly always ( as in Hemingway ) inability to win mastery over self , and through self , over environment . The women in U. S. A. spend a lifetime in bed and are destroyed by having to take the consequences . The men begin life as grotesques , as caricatures of men , scramble after happiness for a time , and disappear finally into the maw of a world where endeavor is futile and happiness a bad dream . They arc all people without dignity , and , in consequence , without passion or tragedy . Their metallic little lives are pointless and their mentalities childish . If we are to believe that Dos Passos intended their experience to be taken as a serious commentary on the futility of human life , then we have a right to demand that his characters be endowed with sufficient substance for our sympathy and sufficient dignity for our despair . It is more likely , however , that they were meant to stand as human beings artistically derived from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Dos Passos himself who becomes the pawn of the times he attempted to depict ; for what he gives us is , like the work of so many of his generation , not a true picture of an era but a picture cut down and distorted to fit the current attitudes of his time ? that life in America is not worth living , that all experience in which Americans have a part is tawdry , pointless , and dull . At present it would seem safe to say that , while he remains a writer of excellence and a predecessor worthy of study , Dos Passos speaks out of an era long dead and from attitudes we can not make compatible with our senses . A NOTHER writer who has been a major influence upon the younger generation is Scott Fitzgerald . Unlike Hemingway and Dos Passos , he has gained steadily in reputation , and today his best books are being reread by young writers as models of good prose and novel form . Although much of his work now seems thin and sentimental , even synthetic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and distinction . Fitzgerald 's people , however trivial their motives may be , have depth and meaning . Their futility does not lie in their lack of moral strength but rather in a misdirection of their energies and ambition , in the pursuance of some end ? wealth , perhaps , or social position , or Gatsby 's romantic dream ? which is really not worth the trouble . Their experience does not disgust us ; it touches us to pity . We are sympathetic because their world gave them no better ideals to strive for , and we are struck by their inability to realize the emptiness of the ones they have . They are important because they do struggle and because they will not admit failure when they fail . Fitzgerald has been able to give them dignity and purpose , even if unworthy purpose , and a reason for being . While his criticism of American ideals of success and of the spiritual vacuity of the wealthy country-club set is sharply penetrating , he is willing to stick to his facts and able to avoid false notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Last Tycoon , his final book , Fitzgerald was very close to a solution of our most pressing artistic problem : how , in a world without heroes , it is possible to give meaning to life and the stature of tragedy to man 's misery . It is unfortunate that he did not live to finish it . He might have taught us a valuable lesson in presenting superficiality , civilized barbarism , and the modern struggle after false gods so that they seem genuinely significant aspects of today 's dilemma . T HOMAS WOLFE , although younger and certainly not technically a member of the Lost Generation , was formed by many of the same circumstances . Traces of his influence , like Hemingway 's , can still be found in the work of younger writers , and his effect upon their perception of the world , particularly upon their perception of youth in relation to the modern world , has been immense . Perhaps more than any other writer , Wolfe has helped to make " lostness " fashionable . Products of his gigantic autobiographical novels are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in search of " the lost lane-end into heaven . " Others are still beating their fists bloody against the walls of furnished bedrooms . Now that individual loneliness is once more a modern occupational disease , the ranks of his followers are growing daily . It is difficult to estimate Wolfe , to separate from our estimation of him the feeling he inspired in us when we were younger . Yet it is that feeling which becomes our surest means of estimating him , for it indicates the extent of his limitation as a writer . Wolfe spoke to the adolescent in us all . When we look today at his wild outpourings of language , his animal cries of joy and despair , and his uncontrolled assertions of life , we find that the spell is gone , that we are no longer touched . We now know why . We have outgrown our childhoods and Wolfe did not outgrow his . His rantings , now that we are more detached , seem petulant , and his poetry strikes us as unbearably nostalgic and sentimental . We are able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even a great artist , but the balance of reason is missing . We learn from him that emotion must be objectified , protest subtilized , and energy compressed by rigid exertion of the will if literature is to be made . We learn , and with the learning we give up a youthful admiration , that like so many of his contemporaries Wolfe did not grow up , and that when he died , at thirty-eight , he had only just begun to reveal a promise of maturity . J AMES JOYCE is , in many respects , the greatest literary figure to come out of the Lost Generation . His profoundly original experimentation in fiction has deeply affected our literature ; in fact it would be safe to say that he , more than any other writer , has been re-responsible for shaping a novel form unique to this century . Yet it is in Joyce 's work that the attitudes of the artistic twenties receive the fullest , most elaborate expansion . His Ulysses is constructed upon the themes of exile and despair ; it is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of art . Its principal characters , Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom , typify respectively all the pallid , arrogant esthetes who ever lived and all the mediocre , frustrated men of business who were believed by Joyce and his younger colleagues to populate the modern earth . The book seems a massive , pedantic experiment in futility , a catalogue of the most decadent philosophies of its day . Its obscurity seems intentional and selfconscious , testifying to the immense conceit of a man who felt above explaining himself , who sought , as a gesture of supreme artistic contempt , to shut out all but the most astute reader from a full realization of his meaning . It is only because we recognize in Joyce the unmistakable mark of genius that we are willing to excuse such an attitude . But we realize the danger of its influence upon his imitators and upon an entire artistic credo . Ulysses represents the extreme of the artfor-art's-sake doctrine , and it has encouraged and justified the antics of the perennial cults of that faith . Their members , lacking Joyce 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that the modern world is entirely too coarse for their sensibilities , too stunned by material considerations to appreciate their art . They believe that comprehensibility in a work of art is a sure symptom of a mediocre talent and a superficial mind , and that the incomprehensible connotes the new and profound . Armed with such a view , they are able to foist upon their disciples work whose obscurity is taken for profundity , whose formlessness is taken for new form , and whose lack of subtlety is hidden effectively under a cloak of confusion . They , like Joyce , are too deep for the readers of books . And they are resigned to being misunderstood or even overlooked , and take comfort from the knowledge that such has always been the lot of the truly great . That Joyce , because of his integrity and detachment , was able to find in Stephen Dedalus ? that partial self-portrait of the artist caught in the trap of his own intellectual crossword puzzle ? a fit object for his cosmic sneer seems to have escaped his followers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's last book , Finnegan Wake , carries past absurdity the effects partially achieved in Ulysses . Here language is no longer sufficient for what Joyce has to say , and so he proceeds to destroy it in order that he will have to say nothing . While we busy ourselves with the Key to Finnegan Wake and the elaborate explanatory material which may afford us some understanding of the book , we are overwhelmed by feelings of pity and disgust . The spectacle of this man laboring heroically for eighteen years to warp language to the uses of his private confusion is the spectacle of a whole creative age short-circuiting itself to ruin . Joyce speaks out of sterility and death . Most often he speaks brilliantly and well , but as with the others , we are forced always to remind ourselves of what he might have said if he had been willing to take upon himself the responsibility for making his great vision understandable . NOT very long ago it seemed to most of the young writers of today that the novelists of the twenties were presenting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture not only of the past but of the present era as well . We grew up reading Hemingway , Dos Passos , Wolfe , and the others , and we absorbed what these men had to say about life before we were old enough or wise enough to check their statements against our own experience . We learned that nymphomania was the common sexual condition of modern woman ; that love was at best merely sexual and a't worst merely automatic ; that drugs , drinks , lust , and violence afforded the only possible excitement and means of escape in a sterile , mechanical world ; and that those who were not artists and writers , those who were business men , farmers , family men , and uneducated men , were stupid and inclined to be either viciously bigoted or mildly absurd . It was only after we had matured a little more , lived for awhile , gone to war , and come to have more faith in our own powers of observation that we began to suspect these assumptions and to substitute others more truly our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still in their twenties . We have not yet had time to develop fully nor to get more than a good start on the work we intend to do . All of us are still learning the fundamentals of living and writing . There are , however , certain views and responses we share in common , that have grown out of our common experience of life in this country and in this era . We know , for one thing , that hysteria and despair will not be the dominant moods of our work , just as they are not the dominant moods of our age . Although we have all , in one way or another , been psychologically shaken by the experience of war , we have not been destroyed nor permanently deranged . We are aware of greater resources within us than the Lost Generation apparently possessed . We seem tougher and less likely to be hurt . This is not insensitivity ; it derives , rather , from a more mature , detached understanding of the forces which haveshaped us and from a deeper understanding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy of disillusion is dead . Exile is a blind alley . Sex , drink , and violence and the other opiates have been assimilated into life . They are no longer good for brave gestures in defiance of convention . Now there is no fixed standard to rebel against . Morals have become , in our time , strictly a private affair . Besides , the road from birth to death is , for us , strewn with far more than discarded contraceptives , gin bottles , and perpetually rumpled beds . Sex is a means of closer union , both physical and spiritual , in a confused and lonely world . Drink is no longer an end in itself , but a part of recreation . Violence angers us , makes us wish for greater human sanity . Most often we are apt to feel trapped and numb , as if our emotions could no longer fully respond to our experience . One of our greatest problems seems to be individual loneliness , the difficulty of communicating with others ? a problem akin to that with which Wolfe concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with destruction , we seem to ask ? more maturely than Wolfe , I trust ? for closer human relations and spiritual harmony . FEW of the books written , thus far , by members of our generation touch upon this problem . Like most early books , they are content to examine small segments of experience and single phases of American life . But within their limits , they explore the delicate intangibles of human feeling and response , and they reflect this time of deep inner unrest and its vague yearnings for a better , freer place . Gore Vidal 's In a Yellow Wood is in many ways representative . It is the account of a single day in the life of a young man who has experienced too much , given too much of himself to conventionality , and who realizes too late that revolt , even for love , is impossible . The cocoons of our identities have been wound too tightly . We can not penetrate them nor break free of them . Sex , for Vidal 's young man , is not automatic nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great beauty , and perhaps it is the truest means of escape from the prison of the self into union with another in love . Although John Horne Burns can not be classed among the youngest of the new writers , his first novel , The Gallery , belongs to their world , the only world they have been able to call their own . The people of The Gallery are those who saw the truth of war . Unlike the very young of Vidal 's book , they were rooted and shaped in the time of peace , an age as worthlessly remote to them as the Paleolithic ; and when they are hurled to live or die into the war world of Africa and Italy , they can not bear what they see . Louella , the Red Cross worker with a mission in life , is the victim of her smug and silly Girl Scoutism because the facts of her existence demand a kind of courage her ideals do not provide . Hal , zhe neurotic lieutenant , seeks an answer to the meaning of a war which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a psychiatric ward believing himself Jesus Christ . Moe , the infantry platoon leader , goes out to die , seeing no meaning in his life or death , knowing that dying will make no difference whatever to him or the world . All either cling to identities which are no longer equal to their experience or lose themselves altogether . The people they.were last week are no longer adequate to the people they must be today . Nothing in their lives prepared them for the chaos they are obliged to face and endure . Burns sees truth with a ferocity of insight any age before ours would have found impossible to bear . But he sees hope also . With the destruction of our most cherished ideals our belief in American honor , kindness , and nobility of purpose ? we must return to the values of human dignity and love . With Vidal , he sees that love is the single unshakable truth left to us , the only condition in which beauty and decency have a chance of survival . And for a world bent upon suicide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books show a new MAGAZINE awareness of man 's dignity . They are both certain that he will continually struggle toward complete self-realization and equally certain that he will continually fail . They present the tragedy of his defeat but not despairingly . They do not urge him to escape from a world too harsh . They ask , rather , that he meet his world and try to better his condition in it . As observers of the truth of their time , they know that there is no help for him , no place else for him to go . Whatever is done , he will have to do for himself . T O RE SURE , we have not yet written anything to compare with the best books of the Lost Generatidn . Neither In a Yellow Wood nor The Gallery gives more than an intimation of the issues which must ultimately concern us . Nor do the others ? Calder Willingham 's End As a Man , Robert Lowry 's Casualty , Thomas Heggen 's Mr. Roberts . But there is reason to believe that the better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Today literature is still in the muddle of war . It would seem that the events of the war years have hardened the creative arteries of some of our best older writers . Too many have lapsed into complete silence . The others of the literary infirm ? the neurotic , aged , ostrich-minded , spiritually peeved , the sweet and the glad ? are apparently still grinding out stuff to fill up the current fiction lists . Those who care for quality in books have just cause for worry . But the young men who write have not . They are neither frightened nor discouraged . They are trying to face reality and to write about it as well as they are able . If they succeed , they will help matters . If they do not , they will not blame our lack of culture nor our crude materialism . They will blame themselves . They know they can write as well here as anywhere . They know that the values they must have to be writers , they will find here or not at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better or worse , are home to stay .
