txt In his statement on the results of the Paris conference , President Truman hailed the still incomplete agreement on Austria as " genuine progress , " promising that country a peace settlement which will free it from the occupation regime and preserve its vital interests . The Austrians themselves are jubilant because they appear to have escaped further dismemberment and because they see fulfillment of their prayer to be " liberated from their liberators : " Thia barbed prayer applies to all occupation forces which have ruled the country for four years by martial law . But it is mainly directed against Soviet Russia , which has sabotaged all earlier efforts at agreement and made Austria a testing ground for its colonial imperialism and a sorry example of the fate of countries within its grip . . As Mr. Truman pointed out , the Moscow agreement of 1943 , which was the first wartime agreement among the Big Powers following the Atlantic Charter , declared that Austria was the first free country to fall victim to Ilitlerite aggression ; that for this reason it was to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , and that it was to be re-established as a free and independent nation . The principles of the Atlantic Charter were explicitly reaffirmed at the Yalta conference as valid for all liberated Europe , ' and the Potsdam conference specifically agreed that reparations should not be exacted from Austria . Despite all this , Russia proceeded to impose on Austria the same terror and the same policy of exploitation which it has imposed on all countries under its domination . It did not succeed in making the Austrian Government a puppet regime because of the presence of other Allied troops  --  a fact which assured free elections in at least part of the country . But in its own zone , which is the main industrial area of Austria , the Soviets at once began to seize everything they could lay hands on . They took 20 per cent of the arable land , most of Austria 's substantial oil production , shipping lines , a good part of the industry , railroad equipment and even homes , post bffices and roads , the combined value of which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a poor country , the size of Maine , with six and a half million population . What is more , Russia removed these assets from Austrian economy for the benefit of its own economy and began to terrorize both the Austrian Government and the population by kidnapping all persons , suspected of possible opposition . In addition , Russia long supported the claims of Yugoslavia for Austrian Carinthia and $150,000,000 in reparations ; and though its exorbitant claims for occupation costs were finally reduced under American pressure , the total cost of all occupation forces still amounts to $500,000,000 , in addition to which Austria has been compelled to care for some 500,000 displaced persons . This explains why the Austrians long for liberation . Indeed , they have survived thus far only because Austria was included in the European Recovery Program , under which the Powers denounced by Russia as imperialists not only supplied 60 per cent of all Austrian food but also renounced all claims on Austria and made good a part of their occupation costs , The price of Austria 's freedom has now been fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which , cynically enough , from the Russian point of view , reaffirms that Austria shall pay " no reparations . " Indeed , Russia has dropped support of the Yugoslav claims , with the result that the now heretical Marshal Tito must content himself with the Austrian assets in his own country , estimated at $4,000,000 . But under a clause in the Potsdam agreement allotting to Russia " German assets " in eastern Austria  --  a clause smuggled into the Potsdam agreement at the last moment in the days when , in Mr. Acheson 's phrase , " men were innocent " ? Russia is still to receive $150,000,000 in cash , most of the Austrian oil interests , the assets of the Danubian Shipping Company , which is the life line of Austria ; many other properties whose value must still be determined , and presumably a guar-. antee for taking out its profits . In return the Soviets graciously consent to restore some of the seized properties to Austria . But the properties they retain are not only vital to Austrian survival but are likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia with both a continued foothold in Austria and an excuse to establish its own " factory guards . " Such " factory guards " provided the armed force for the Communist coup in Czechoslovakia ; they can , if the Western Powers do not remain on guard , serve a like purpose in Austria .
