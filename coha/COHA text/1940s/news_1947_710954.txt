txt On July 30 , 1941 , more than Sour months before the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor , Abraham Livingston Gump , internationally known dealer in.oriental-art , called the atten , tion of President Roosevelt by ; letter to the probability that ' the Japanese might try a sneak attack . Gump 's letter , based on his contacts in Japan and on a half century of business dealings with Orientals , received only a routine acknowledgment from the state department 's division of far eastern affairs on Aug. 30 , 1941 . Gump died last Aug. 29 at ' the age of 77 , heart broken to : the last with the knowledge ' that his warning had not been heeded and that because it was not heeded thousands'of American lives were sacrificed at Pearl harbor on Dec. 7 , 1941 . The letter and the reply were ? disclosed to THE TRIBUNE today by Richard Benjamin Gump , who has sucmeded his father as head of the famed Gump store here . Exchanged Letters Richard Gump , in making the , correspondence public for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been on . terms of direct letter writing with Roosevelt for more than 20-years . Altho the elder Gump never met the President personally , the latter , from ? the time he was governor of New York , had been purchasing ship models from Gump ; Roosevelt himself always had written Gump on those matters , but the President did not reply personally to the momentous letter of July 30 , 1941 . Here is what Abraham Gump wrote to " My Dear Mr. Presi , dent " on that day : " Having done business with the Orient for the last 50 years , I am familiar with many of their idiosyncrasies and . know any gesture of kindness or appeasement is misinterpreted by the Japanese as significant of fear . Urges Surprise , " If at any time it comes to pass that a firing war should open between this country and Japan , may I suggest that we do not fail to take full advantage of the element of surprise . " Turning back the pages of ' history , you no doubt will remember that Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the first : naval engagement . Russia , . from a naval point of view , never fully recovered from this initial blow . Of these . circumstances I am sure you . are familiar . " I have a great feeling for . you , my dear Mr. President , in these heart breaking , stirring times and I know of no one who would measure up to this superhuman endeavor in a more enlightened way than my'President . Most earnestly , A. Livingston Gump . " Reply from U.S. And here is the reply a. month later on state department stationery : " My dear Mr. Gump : Your letter of July 30 , 1941 , ad , dressed to the President in regard to the situation in the far east has been referred to ' this department . " You may be assured that the contents of your letter have . been carefully noted and that the spirit which prompted you It ; bring your views to the government ' s attention is appreciated . Your kind personal tribute to the President is also appreciated . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adams , assistant chief , divi-. sion of far eastern . affairs . " Richard Gump recalled that on Dec : 7 , 1941 , his father set by the radio , heard the news of the attack on Pearl Harbor , then wept and said brokenly : " My prediction was correct . " Then the elder Gump 's sorrow turned to anger . He never wrote the President again . HO did , however , carry about a copy of his letter and the state department reply and , after we were in the war , showed these documents to several admirals and generals . The admirals and generals just shrugged , Richard Gump said . Gump said he and his brother , Robert , tried to enlist in the navy late in 1940 , but Robert was turned down because of poor vision and Gump because of a ' leg ailment . Richard said he offered to go on an espionage mission to Japan , but the government would n't let him do that , either . Robert got into the eirmy later , rising from a private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Red Cross .
