Submarines of Britain 's Royal Navy have sunk more than 1,250,000 tons of Axis shipping in the Mediterranean alone since war began . As commander of His Majesty 's Submarine Safari , and other submarines , handsome , whimsical , young ( 29 ) Lieut . Richard Barklie Lakin , D.S.O. , D.S.C. , R.N. , has had his share of kills . In his words , this is part of his story as he told it in New York City last week : <P> I chose submarine service because I was lazy . Submariners got more pay , and had more time in port . That appealed to me . I was navigating officer on H.M.S. Ursula real name , use permitted by the British Admiralty , out five days on a patrol in the Helgoland Bight when war began . <P> " White Christmas . " In 1941 I went as first lieutenant of H.M.S. Utmost . It was after the very first attack on a convoy that I was depth-bombed for the first time . None of us knew what to expect from a depth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , holding onto the brass ladder as these things went off . With the first few bangs there was a shower of the white cork which lines the hull to absorb moisture . We called the downfall a " white Christmas . " <P> Our man on the ASDIC could hear the destroyer coming , coming , and he reported : " Destroyer closing , destroyer closing , " and you knew sooner or later it would be over the top . Then you hear the sort of faint splash-splash of the propeller getting faster and faster . This is the most frightening time . You hear this thing going over and you wonder , " Has he dropped it now ? " I forget how many depth charges were dropped , 40 or 50 . I remember saying to myself : " This is hell , and I am not going to stay in submarines any more . I just ca n't take it . " I looked around . The men were not very happy , and were wetting their lips a bit . Well , when we got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had sunk five ships of 20,000 total tonnage . We had a hell of a blind and plenty of hooch . After that , I was ready for the next patrol . <P> " A Very Nice Bang . " I went back to my old submarine , the Ursula , in 1942 but this time as captain . Our first patrol was to cover one of the convoys to Russia . It was badly beaten up . The submarines were along to cover in case the Tirpitz and the Scheer came out . They did . A friend of mine in another submarine made a radio signal to say they were out , but those two great disappearers went right back in and we did n't see them again . <P> Submarines were chosen to act as beacons in the North African landing . We took position about ten miles from Oran to shine lights and guide the invasion fleet . It was a very easy job . Then we pushed north , off the Balearic Islands . One afternoon , creeping toward " Gib , " my officer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrier . On a closer look it turned out to be a submarine . My orders were like everyone else 's : if you see a German U-boat , fire everything you have got . We had six torpedoes ; we fired all and held our breath . There was a very nice bang at the end of the right time . Through the periscope I saw he had been hit just behind the conning tower and sank very quickly . It was quite fun ; it gives you quite a kick . His stern sank lower and lower , and his bow came up out of the water , right straight up , and woof !
