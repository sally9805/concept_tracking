you would have been a show girl in George White 's Scandals of 1926 . Your name was Portland Hoffa . It was your real name , but nobody believed it . You were born in Portland , Oregon . You have a sister named after Lebanon , Pennsylvania . Another called Lastone . You 'd say this fast ? Last'n . Your Broadway life was duller than any stenographer 's . You " went steady " for five years . He was an actor who wrote acts for other fellows . You thought him clever . The girls in the show thought you were wasting your time . He never took you anywhere , not to a night club , not even to a speakeasy . Finally they said , " It must be love . " It was . In the spring of 1927 you asked the Scandals press agent please to send out the announcement of your wedding . The press agent said , " Never marry an actor . " But the announcement was sent ? to fourteen papers . Only three printed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notices . You still have them , because you are still beautifully sentimental . It 's been fifteen years now . That press agent must be eating his words . For your life runs simply , smoothly , like this : You live in a four-room and twobath apartment in a big , solid , oldfashioned house in New York City . You chose it because the walls are thick and your husband can work in peace . He has been a top radio star for ten years . He writes all his own programs . So you seldom go out together ? usually on Monday nights , for dinner , then to the theatre or a movie . You rarely wear a formal dress . Except for a diamond wrist watch , you sport no jewelry . You have two fur coats ? a three-quarter-length Persian lamb and a beaver . You love tailored suits and buy good ones , wearing them several seasons . In the winter you wear flannel nightgowns . You do n't wear opentoed slippers or crazy hats , " because Fred does n't like them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've let your hair grow gray . You walk a lot . You eat two meals a day . You 've kept that Scandals figure . Your maid ( she sleeps out ) serves breakfast around eleven . Then you help her with the beds . Three afternoons a week , while Fred goes to the gym , you go shopping or have your hair done . Except for Last'n , who does Fred 's typing , you do n't have company for dinner , because , starting Tuesday night , he begins the grind . Shut away in his study , he works every night , sometimes until three in the morning . When Last'n is n't there , you type , and you always read proof on each show . While Fred works , you sit in the bedroom . The furniture is maple , the rugs rag , the bedspreads chenille ? the kind made to flop on . Here you read , crochet , knit , listen to radio thriller serials , and keep telephone calls away from Fred . One night a week you take your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By Thursday the script is finished . Friday you rehearse . Friday evening you have dinner in a restaurant and , if there 's no rewriting to be done , trot along with Fred to the fights . Saturday you worry about Sunday 's show . You go to bed early Saturday night , because Sunday morning you go to church , then rehearse again . Sunday afternoon you take a nap . After the show , Sunday night , you sit around while Fred has a conference with his idea men . Monday it begins all over again . You rarely use the living room . You go for the dinette and kitchen . You make a wow of a salmon loaf , because Fred hates fish unless it 's disguised .  | " It seems appropriate today , Robbie Teach it to your pupils . Teach the ! beauty , and they will know how to fad ugliness . Teach them life , and they wit smile at death .

" Miss Robbin finished writing the poet on the blackboard . There it was , spread out for the eleventh graders to see ? foul stanzas . At the beginning the title , " TN ! Dying Patriot . " Underneath , the author% name , James Elroy Flecker ( 1884-1915 ) 4 She surveyed her work a moment , the ! laid the chalk in place , dusted off het fingers , and sat down at her desk . picked up Peter 's letter . Above to " Dear Robbie " she saw what she had dreaded and feared all those weeks to see , the place and date : " Pearl Harbcr , December 7 , 1941 .

No bones broken and no black eyes . Hope yea have n't worried . Love , Peter . " The eleventh graders , writing away . saw before them a blackboard covered with words that they must learn . They saw a teacher sitting at her desk , folding a letter and putting it back in the envelope . They did not observe the smile on her face , the radiance in her eyes . They did not know that Miss Robbin was thinking at that moment that a school bus had just drawn up in front d Hearthstone . That a tousled red head had poked through one of the windows , that a shrill , triumphant , beloved voice had called out gaily , " Hi , there , Miss Robbie '  |
