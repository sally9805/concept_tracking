/11HREE is a magic number , and a bay 1 is in the upper bracket of wonders of the world . If you are in a lake in a boat , you can not get anywhere else ; if on an island , you are completely isolated . But a bay permits access to all the seven seas , and at the same time affords a safe haven from dangers , within the kindly outstretched arms of Mother Earth . Along the great curving sweep of the Pacific from Mexico to Panama there are forty-odd bays , and into every one we nosed the Zaca . It was the Thirty-eighth Expedition made by the Department of Tropical Research of the New York Zoological Society , and for the second time Templeton Crocker had put his splendid two-masted yacht at our disposal in our search for rare creatures of sea and land . We found each bay to be a little world in itself , bounded on one side by great smashing breakers of the open sea , and on the other by range upon range of lofty sierras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by insulation , preserved the ancient charm and simplicity of the native inhabitants . The twoscore bays were as individual as people ; some were good for our purposes , others quite barren of life . But always the great breakers of the Pacific boomed on rock or sand , the surging tides reaching up hungrily and impartially toward cactus or orchid ; always the life of tide pools and shallows , and the unbelievable creatures of the cold black depths , held us breathless . An exploring scientist 366 I cheats life at every step , for minute by minute he is able to extract more of fun and sheer joy than any other human being . Tangola-Tangola may be taken as typical of the bays of southwestern Mexico , a sort of no man 's land as to north and south . From the first day we saw it on the chart it appeared promising , with its sheltered anchorage and varied types of bottom for dredging . Furthermore , we liked its name , with its stuttering suggestion of a South Sea island . Back from the crescent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low hills covered thickly with scrubby cactus growth and small trees , partly dry , partly green , with here and there masses of white frangipani , or scattered blossoms of bright yellow . The only radical departure from this type of foliage was the low stretches of intense green mangroves , marking the contours of lagoons of various sizes , just behind the sand dunes . Landing through breakers is always exciting . When there were several of us , the danger , even from an unexpected undertow , was reduced to minimum , yet we were always worried about guns , cameras , and glasses until we were safe ashore . Curiously enough , the greatest risk in this respect , until we learned how to cope with it , was after the boat had stranded in barely six inches of water . With our precious instruments clutched tight , we sat braced on the seats , facing shoreward , while our Samoan manoeuvred so that we should start on the summit of one of the lesser swells and ride it swiftly , with the next , perhaps a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any explanation , and it is probably an endless series of coincidences , but time after time the waves seemed to come in threes ? three ordinary ones , then a whale of a fourth . Up and down we would float , high aloft and down into the trough of swell after swell . Then Pe 's muscles would ripple ; quick powerful strokes gave us impetus , so that we remained on the crest , rushing along with it faster and faster , yet holding back to the shoulder of the green-curving breaker ; then a final rush through the seething white smother . The froth came past , far higher than our gunwale , but water at such a moment has no time to turn and pour sideways , and it and we must hurtle shorewards . With a final pull Fe shouted to us to leap , and , even as we obeyed , the sand had stopped the boiling flood and turned it back . Now was the critical moment , and we had learned to look at the boat or at the shore , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this last , the optical illusion would be our undoing . Time after time , until I had learned better , I stepped out of an absolutely stationary boat , solidly grounded in the sand , and pitched forward headlong on my face . The stop had occurred without a jolt , but the return wave rushing past us out to sea gave the impression that we were surging swiftly ahead . All our instinctive sense of balance came into play to counteract this movement , and before our feet could undeceive us , could tell that there was no motion whatever , we would crash to our knees in the sandy rush . It was the old story of another train slowly passing our stationary one , only this was deception carried to the nth power . The best way of all was to shut one 's eyes and jump . Just as we started swell-riding in Tangola-Tangola , a terrific tug on my trolling line nearly upset me , and some great fish splashed astern . Simultaneously , a magnificent male man-o ' - war bird swooped on narrow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pouch half inflated , and looked at my catch . I had only a net and the line in my hand , and when we stranded I was over like a flash . All I had learned about not looking at the passing wave was forgotten in the excitement , and , although we were motionless in three inches of water , I soot forward in a beautiful somersault . My wrist was cut deep by the taut line before I could get up , stop the fish , avoid the next wave , and haul in a lovely lilac and bronze jack-crevalle , fighting to the last , and drawing several others of his kind up to the curving , transparent mirror of the second line of swells . II At one side of the bay of Tangola , squared , were steep cliffs , and here giant limpets were everywhere , especially on the outermost promontories . They were really big chaps , measuring about four by six inches , sloping up at a slow , comfortable angle to a blunt summit . At almost low tide , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crawling about . Above water they were scattered quite regularly as to general abundance , but with no regularity as to orientation of head , rear , or side , and averaging about two limpet lengths from each other . This made it difficult for any individual to move in a straight line without touching or climbing over the shell of a neighbor . Long before the tide covered them , the limpets began to stand on tiptoe , which is to say about a half inch from the rock , to get under way and to graze . Each was surrounded by an aura of short greenish alga : . I selected one limpet , named him Breathless , and watched him . He protruded his head and began creeping slowly forward . As he moved , he ex- deleted material rock dries they are back on their old stand , tight clamped , brooding on whatever limpets know to brood upon . Once settled down , they are impervious to any ordinary attack by any reasonable enemy . More than a century ago Walter Scott wrote , ' He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is the limpet 's quality of qualities . Give him warning , and even the tip of a knife can not be inserted beneath his person . Whether by the judicious seepage of some weak acid or by sheer attrition , these big fellows are just sufficiently counter-sunk into the rock to make their socket impregnable . Other kinds of limpets have an oblong hole at the summit of their shelly wigwams ? they are known as keyhole limpets . But the great limpets of Tangola-Tangola ? Patella mexicana , conchologists call them ? lived in solid , massive , concrete tents ; the lock was spiked , the key thrown away , and the combination wholly lost in a passive resistance which should confine their Enemy Number One to old age . As I sat and watched my special limpet city , my mind went back to a time three decades ago on the opposite side of the world , when I sat in my Chinese houseboat and looked at one of the strangest of cities . It too had quaint roofs , it was built on mighty rocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was on the Yangtze River , at the entrance of the great gorges , and its name was Ichang . So before I left my Tangola-Tangola city of limpets I printed the word ICHANG very blackly , and erected it in a cleft stick . I felt it was appropriate because in Chinese it means Fitting Prosperity , ' and I thought the limpets would like that . At times even a scientist likes to be foolish . III The Bay of Corinto is small , in the heart of a wilderness of mangroves , grotesque trees standing everywhere on spindly stilt ; of roots in glistening mud , or wading knee-deep at high tide . We looked eastward from the deck of the Zaca as she swung at her Corinto anchorage , and the horizon was a level stretch of green . This was the outer , pioneer growth of the mangrove wilderness , and was worthily named Isla Encantada ? the Enchanted Island . In a launch we went up the main tidal waterway , locally called rio , and on for miles into smaller and smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on marshy land , where we caught glimpses of apparently amphibious cattle . There was no need to blaze our way , although every mangrove looked exactly like every other millionth one , and although , en route , we boxed nine tenths of the compass . In order to retrace our steps we simply drifted with the ebbing tide , and always chose larger and larger openings . Patient herons were everywhere , motionless as Japanese screens ? waiting for low tide ; gaudy crabs scuttled around the arching roots , which in turn were braided with sleeping snails and frilled with oysters . As we paddled along the tortuous channels , unexpected things happened : as when something fell from an overhead branch into the water near by and drenched us with spray . The only person who happened to be watching said it was a very short and thick snake , but I had seen an iguana in the air before , and knew that the closely folded legs in the dive would make a half glimpse fit this description . This water dive gains interest when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread-eagles to fullest extent to help break its fall onto scrub , and incidentally to make us wonder if such a performance was not part of the beginning of flight in birds . At low tide a seining party went into the mangroves and tried to land on an exposed mud bank . The first two men sank slowly , but with apparent prospect of complete ultimate submergence into the black , sticky mass . They were ex- deleted material the sleeping tens of thousands of little breathing forms . Scores of mangroves had their foliage doubled , as innumerable pairs of parrakeets huddled close together on the branches , and apart from all other pairs . Without our man-made , high-power binoculars we should never have known what they were . But the scientist in me was still far from satisfied . There are more than a dozen species of parrots and parrakeets in this general region , and how could I make certain of the exact species of this somnolent army ? I offered a reward , then a larger one , a third more munificent . All to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mangroves at night : cases ? things ' ? floated there in the moonlight which it were ill to gaze upon . As so often happens to me , proof came in a roundabout way . We were drinking most excellent beer amid the tarnished magnificence of Christie 's bar in Corinto when I was hailed by a stout , jolly person who recalled to me that in years past I used to buy birds from him , at the time I was building up the collection in the Zoological Society 's Zoo . In the back yard of the bar were hundreds of parrots and small sad-faced monkeys , which he was taking to New York . He had none of my parrakeets , but knew of a boy who had caught one . The bird had fallen into the water , after a fight with one of its kind , from a large passing flock . The boy was summoned and the bird changed hands for fifty centavos , or about twelve cents . It was perfectly tame and climbed about our persons , making contented little sounds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant personality , clothed in greens of various pleasing shades , from grass to apple . As we approached the Zaca I was externally merely the possessor of a new pet ; within I felt the unpleasant symptoms of a Judas . On board , Perico immediately held court and happily received the approval of everyone . Only the cats watched the newcomer with unexpressive agate eyes , but a slight movement of the lips . What I had to do I had to do quickly , so while everyone was drinking cocktails I excused myself with some mumbled lie and went below . When I came up I had an extra-quick one and probably exhibited futile enthusiasms about nothing in particular . One of my staff has a keen nose for chloroform , and soon after dinner my crime was discovered . I became an outcast and a thing abhorred and was reminded none too gently that even to the lowest savages the life of a guest is sacred . I protested something about the cats , and that Perico had passed away painlessly with a smile on her beak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fulfilled a destiny of sorts and we now knew that the mangrove multitudes were Aratinga holochlora strenna , the Nicaraguan Ivory-billed Green Parrakeet . At which my unsympathetic Carcinologist remarked , ' So what ? ' III We were blown out of Nicaragua and into Costa Rica by a lusty Papagayo . For some unknown reason this word , which in German means ' parrot , ' here signified an eternal continental draft , a pain in the neck of our researches , blowing through the open window in the wall of the mighty Sierra Mountains . It is a whole winter affair , from November to April , so if you are a native you either get used to it or go crazy . For once I appreciated the old-fashioned maps which had personified cherubs and devils blowing , with distended cheeks , the good and the evil winds . The first notch in the coast of Costa Rica is the bay of Santa Elena , and we headed for a baylet in its side with the title of El Canelo , or Cinnamon Bay . After the hours of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Spice . In fact it proved to be one of the loveliest places of earth , bounded by mountains which mitigated the source of the wind , roughly circular , about a mile across , with heavy jungle on the nearer slopes . The higher ranges to the north rose to grass and rocky heights , the trees dying out in straggling pioneers . There may be more diversified regions , but for its size I have never seen its equal in this respect . The greatest drawback was the overlapping of distinct areas ? the three-ringed circus of interest of the wild life of sea , shore , and jungle . This is a bay where I should like to spend a full year through all the seasons , watching the shift and change under water , along the shore , in mangroves , palm and thorn forest , and upland grass meadows . One of our first trips took us through lush mangroves , the tide carrying us along through ever-narrowing channels until we pushed our way by hand along ultimate water paths , flushing curlews , bitterns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we climbed up into an enchanted forest , or rather park , of lofty trees where bands of spider monkeys swung by their tails , apparently exchanging pointed remarks on how queer human beings looked upside down . One lot of three females were all carrying babies , and in all the pram method was identical . The baby had its tail tightly wrapped around the base of its mother 's tail , as it lay on her back , with its little arms around her mid-body , gripping the hair on the lower sides . The hind legs lay straight out behind , with the black soles up , dangling close to the haunch of the mother . In this way the limbs and tail of the parent were quite free , and the baby safe from any sudden danger of being crushed when the mother dropped from one branch or tree to another , with widespread limbs . When the parents sat down and looked at us , the little chaps would pull themselves up , and their black faces would peer at us alongside that of their mummy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that all the mem bars of the band followed one another , and took exactly the same path through the trees . Each took hold of the identical part of the same branch as the one ahead , leaped free at the same spot , and used the hands at the same place . Arboreal safari for spider monkeys is as fixed as a well-worn trail through thick undergrowth . Until I was allowed to possess a gun I was botanist a nd entomologist of sorts ; then I became ornithologist for the greater part of my life , and in the last decade I have turned ichthyologist . These are all lip-services , however , for the underlying urge is to glimpse some small , clear gleam of the workings of evolution in some sub-sub-division of an insignificant bypath of animal life and development . So it was that in the intervals between actually straining every effort to solve fish problems of this bay , I was conscious of the wild life in general . My two assistants had left me alone on East Beach , one on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimate life of the fiddler crabs among the mud-flats farther along the shore . I settled down between two giant black mangrove trees , one of which was hollow , wind- and age-worn . I made camp by opening my dispatch case of glasses , note-books , and vials , scooped two holes in the sand for my heels , and sat down on a life-preserver filched from the boat . This precaution was out of respect for the ! Ate rouge , those infinitesimal mites which seem to be among the most successful of living creatures , sustained by the ultimate nth-power hope of being able to feast upon a human being before they die . I have found them equally enthusiastic on the tennis courts of Virginia and in the tropical jungles of British Guiana , and here on the shores of the Pacific they teemed from the grass of the upland meadows to the very jetsam of high tide line . As my job today was static , I allowed myself the luxury of two pairs of glasses , my smallest Number Threes for near-by use and quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for distance . In addition to my two giant mangroves was a third , a whitened , dead tree . Hardly had I taken my seat when a sonorous swish of wings drew my eyes , and out flew a great blue heron , whose spindly frame and immobility had up to this moment made him one with the tree . As I looked , two black hawks flew into the same tree , the common white-banded black species . They were handsome birds and peered at me fearlessly , uttering pleasantly quavering hawk notes . An interesting thing about birds of prey is the possibility of prophesying the diet of a species from its psychological reaction to human beings . At one end are the vultures which are almost completely fearless . At the other are the fierce falcons and eagles , who pursue and kill their prey , diving after the strongest and swiftest creatures they can manage . These black hawks have the noble facies of gerfalcons , but their all-too-tameness hints that gastronomically they are among the ignoble Raptores , satisfied at the most with small lizards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even dead fish . There is nothing vulturine in their mien , but their ease in the presence of mankind is a certain proof that no black hawk ever struck down a flying duck , or any bird near its own weight . By the same token bald eagles are far less wild than are golden eagles . Two blurred objects on the shore , near two stranded logs , came into focus with a twist of the binocular thread . They were a pair of spotted sandpipers , one with a primary feather reversed and standing straight up from the wing , waving in the breeze . I watched them idly as they passed on , when suddenly there took place within the small circle of the lens a happening that brought me to breathless attention . The little chap with the half-molted feather was abruptly knocked off his feet into a flutter- ing heap . Discarding the glass , I saw the whole tragedy clearly . The second log , the one somewhat farther away , had come suddenly to life , shifting from dead vegetable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sideways flick had knocked the sandpiper over . As I looked , a head turned , jaws opened , and a four-foot crocodile sank from sight with the pitiful fluff of feathers . I watched the rising stream of bubbles , I listened to the agonizing peeeep-peeeepl of the other bird and the shrieking cackles of two oyster-catchers until all were lost in the distance . The only remaining proof of what my eyes had seen was that there remained just one log instead of two . I immediately focused on the second to make certain it was what it appeared to be . During the past two days I had watched small crocodiles floating past , but the movement plus the two bulging eyes identified them at once . This stranded individual had completely fooled two sandpipers and myself . A medley of voices arose soon after the sandpiper tragedy , and as it did not die down , I walked quietly along the inland trail . Just beyond the uprooted base of a giant tree , I saw the flock of birds and simultaneously felt a sharp bite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of march of army ants , and as instantly I stepped out again . The reason for the flock now became apparent ; they were the camp-following vanguard feeding on the insects which crept , ran , hopped , or flew to escape their dreaded enemy . I found a convenient dead branch and as quietly as possible drew it back and forth across the trail of the ants . I knew that this would so infuriate them that they would deploy in search of the creature which dared disturb them , and this would keep them , and consequently the birds , in the same place for some time . I sought safety and settled to watch . There were four kinds of antbirds and a surprising lot of orioles . Three troupials fluttered about after deleted material specific or only individual significance . The snake was twenty Feet above me , on a dead branch which would not sustain my weight for a moment . I cut a long , forked stick and began to jiggle him , which made him only grip the tighter . He began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good purchase with a recurved crook , and swinging on it , broke the whole branch , and down came a rain of rotten wood , debris , dust , and more than seven feet of snake . Fearing it would escape if it touched the ground , I blindly clutched at it in mid-air , and no lifelong-trained juggler could have done it better , for my fingers closed firmly around the neck just behind the head . Like all his kind , he gaped widely , uttering hiss after hiss , showing every needle tooth and an enormous expanse of dead white gullet , all the time trying with every muscle to coil and twist free . Then he gave up and , as boas are real gentlemen , he shrugged whatever passes for serpentine shoulders and resigned himself to what might come . From this moment on , there was no visible resentment or active attempt at escape . The coils came slowly up and around my hand and arm , and when I had cleared the dirt from my eyes , I did not have to shift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found there was no string or bag or container , so that I had to shift my hold to my left hand and continue my notes with my right . My foot rested gently on his tail on the sand , because with all his folds in a double lock on my wrist he was able to stop the blood supply , and the hand ached too much to keep a tight grip . As it was , I had to stop writing every ten minutes , shift hands , and exercise to restore circulation . As the lowering sun struck his armor , he was one of the most beautiful things in the world , each scale giving off blue and green fire-opal reflections . Like the jumbled mass of leaf patterns and leaf shadows scattered along his body , his very eyes , lidless and unwinliing , were also mottled with gray and brown , while the vertical slit of visual connection with the outside world was almost invisible . During one of the hand-to-hand shifts I happened to look out over the bay , and saw floating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the awkward embrace of chelonian affection . I focused my glasses and perceived that it was a most active amorous episode , for not only were they excitedly clambering over and around one another , but both were revolving as they drifted past . First one arched back would emerge decorated with clusters of barnacles , and then the other , gay with waving strands of emerald seaweed . Which sex flaunted the weed and which had acquired the barnacle insignia will never be known . This afternoon was rapidly becoming dominantly a reptilian one . When I withdrew my eyes from the binoculars , I found that I was quite securely handcuffed by two loops of boa , one of which was a figure eight . I saw the boatmen approaching , and did not untwine the snake until they had had full benefit of what to them was an incredibly terrible situation . They were strong , brave , able seamen , but I think if it came to a choice of unwinding the coils with their own hands they would have left me marooned forever on the beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boa overnight on the yacht , and next day set him free on the exact spot on which he would have fallen from the tree . He gathered himself together , watched me calmly , and finally , with exploratory flickering of his tongue , slowly and with dignity made his way into a tangle of underbrush . From the opposite side I watched him glide smoothly away . Long before he had passed from my actual field of vision , he vanished suddenly from my inability to disentangle him from his surroundings . The boa constrictor of East Beach had entered and had left my life ; he none the worse , and I with added knowledge and respect for him and for his race .
