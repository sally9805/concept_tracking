When he went back to his home town in 1915 to practice medicine , young Dr. William Lowry Pressly worked under a small handicap . It was embarrassing to be remembered , and hailed , as " Buck . " But before long he was " Dr. Buck . " After 33 years he is still Dr. Buck to most of the 2,250 people in Due West , * S.C . But in other ways , times have changed . <P> In wintertime , when the roads were too bad even for a model T , Dr. Buck used to make his calls in a horse &; buggy . He traded in his model Ts every four months , and wore out 22 . Last week the American Medical Association , meeting in St. Louis , picked Dr. Buck , 61 , from three nominees offered by the board of trustees , as the general practitioner of the year . <P> The gold medal and certificate given to him , Dr. Pressly says , mark the approaching end of the old country doctor who worked alone . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past six years , Dr. Pressly has had two doctors working for him on salary . He has a hard time keeping them because they prefer the " easier life " of the big-city specialist . He has two nurses , a maid and bookkeeper . His brick-veneer , well-equipped clinic building , which started out with seven rooms , now has 13 . <P> If country doctors work together in a clinic , says Pressly , both doctors and patients are better off . The doctors can take time off for vacations or for refresher courses ; the patients get more thorough care . A general practitioner , he thinks , can take care of 85% of the people who are sick ; only about 15% need specialists . In his early days , 90% of his practice was home calls , 10% office . Now the percentage is nearly reversed . Says he : " People realize they get more for their money in a clinic or a doctor 's office .
