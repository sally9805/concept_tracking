Who would control the new Senate ? Republicans , in the minority for 13 years , needed a net gain of ten seats to take over. * To many a practiced politico , this had seemed like an insuperable obstacle . But by last week , what with the Wallace fracas and the meat shortage , some had begun to change their minds . <P> Almost everybody , Democrats and Republicans alike , conceded that Pennsylvania 's earnest , able Governor Edward Martin would sweep out New Dealing Joe Guffey and that John Bricker would have an easy time in Ohio knocking off Democratic Senator James W. Huffman . Dopesters were also pretty sure that the Democrats would pick up a seat in Kentucky , which now has a Republican Senator only because of an interim appointment by its Republican Governor . <P> That left nine seats for the G.O.P. to pick up . They would have to do it in 14 states . <P> New York . The Broadway betting boys put it this way : 6-to-5 either way on Republican Irving Ives or Democrat Herbert Lehman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would give Jim Mead a beating in the Governor race . The odds told the story : if Tom Dewey gave Jim Mead a terrific enough thumping , Irving Ives could ride in on the Dewey coattails . <P> Massachusetts . The campaign had not begun-there was no point trying to interest the voters until Boston got over its World Series ( see SPORT ) . But the key to the election is Boston and its agile Mayor Jim Curley , who dislikes old ( 73 ) Senator David Ignatius Walsh almost as much as he does 44-year-old Republican Henry Cabot Lodge Jr . If Jim Curley does not line up Boston 's machine and heavy Catholic vote for jowly Dave Walsh , a Republican trend among independents could easily put Lodge over . In any event , Lodge has a good chance to return to the Senate seat he resigned to go to war . <P> West Virginia . Last week , John Lewis ' United Mine Workers , a potent factor in all West Virginia elections , withheld endorsement of either Democratic Senator Harley Martin Kilgore ( who expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sweeney of Wheeling . Harley Kilgore was worried not so much by absence of the miners ' blessing as by absence of miners ' meat . Smart , energetic Tom Sweeney figured that his chances had risen from 50-to-50 to 52-to-48 . The prospect : a hard-run race . <P> Missouri . A Republican swell is running - for many Missourians are not proud of their native son in the White House . Harry Truman 's appointed successor , hamhanded Senator Frank Briggs , will probably lose to neat , conservative , colorless James P. Kem , unless the Pendergast machine in Kansas City and the P.A.C . in St. Louis can roll up an overwhelming Democratic vote . Briggs 's theme : loyalty to Truman . Kem 's strategy : wham away at controls , left-wingers , Pendergastery.
