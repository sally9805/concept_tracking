Buzby 's Petrified Woman Loren C Eiseley I THINK the sound of the wind in that country never stopped . I think everyone there was a little mad because of it . In the end I suppose I was like all the rest . It was a country of topsy-turvy , where great dunes of sand blew slowly over ranch houses and swallowed them , and where , after the sand had all blown away from under your feet , the beautiful arrowheads of ice-age hunters lay mingled with old whisky bottles that the sun had worked upon . I suppose , now that I stop to think about it , that if there is any place in the world where a man might fall in love with a petrified woman , that may be the place . In the proper books , you understand , there is no such thing as a petrified woman , and I insist that when 1 first came to that place I would have said the same . It all happened because bone hunters are listeners . They have to be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made queries in a hundred towns , and tramped as many canyons . The institution for which we worked had received a total of one Oligocene turtle and a bag of rhinoceros bones . A rag picker could have done better . The luck had to change . Somewhere there had to be fossils . I was cogitating on the problem under a coating of lather in a barbershop with an 1890 chair when I became aware of a voice . You can hear a lot of odd conversation in barbershops , particularly in the back country , and particularly if your trade makes you a listener , as mine does . But what caught my ear at first'was something about stone . Stone and bone are pretty close in my language and I was n't missing any bets . There was always a chance that there might be a bone in it somewhere for me . The voice went off into a grumbling rural complaint in the back corner of the shop , and then it rose higher . " It 's petrified ! It 's petrified ! " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up through the lather . " I 'm a-tellin ' ya , " the man boomed , " a petrified woman , right out in that canyon . But he wo n't show it , not to nobody . ' Tai n't fair , I tell ya . " " Mister , " I said , speaking warily between the barber 's razor and his thumb , " I 'm reckoned a kind of specialist in these matters . Where is this woman , and how do you know she 's petrified ? " I knew perfectly well she was n't , of course . Flesh does n't petrify like wood or bone , but there are plenty of people who : think so . In the course of my life I 've been offered objects purporting to be everything from petrified butterflies to a gentleman 's top hat . Just the same I was still interested in this " This narrative , " writes Professor Eiseley , head of the department of anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania , " is founded on an actual incident , but somehow has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . " woman . You can never tell what will turn up in the back country . Once , for example , I had a mammoth vertebra handed to me with the explanation that it was a petrified griddle cake . Mentally , now , I was trying to shape that woman 's figure into the likeness of a mastadon 's femur . This is a hard thing to do when you are young and far from the cities . Nevertheless , I managed it . I held that shining bony vision in my head and asked directions of my friend in the barbershop . Yes , he told me , the woman was petrified all right . Old Man Buzby was n't a feller to say it if it ' twere n't so . And it were n't no part of a woman . It was a whole woman . Buzby had said that , too . But Buzby was a queer one . An old bachelor , you know . And when the boys had wanted to see it , ' count of it hein ' a sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had clammed up on where it was . A-keepin ' it all to hisself , he was . But seem ' as I was interested in these things and a stranger , he might talk to me and no harm done . It was the trail to the right and out and up to the overhang of the hills . A little tar-papered shack there . I ASKED Mack to go up there with me . He was silent company but one of the best bone hunters we had , Whether it was a rodent the size of a bee or an elephant the size of a house , he 'd find it and he 'd get it out even if it meant carrying a five-hundred-pound plaster cast on foot over a mountain range . In a day we reached it . When I got out of the car I knew the wind had been blowing there since time began . There was a rusty pump in the yard and rusty wire and rusty machines nestled in the lea of a wind-carved butte . Everything was leaching and blowing away by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the door came Buzby . He was not blowing away , I thought at first . His farm might be , but he was n't . There was an air of faded dignity about him . Now in that country there is a sort of etiquette . You do n't drive out to a man 's place , a bachelor 's , and you a stranger , and come up to his door and say : " I heard in town you got a petrified woman here , and brother , I sure would like to see it . " You 've got to use tact , same as anyWhere else . You get out slowly while the starved hounds look you over and get their barking done . You fumble for your pipe and explain casually you 're doin ' a little lookin ' around in the hills . About that time they get a glimpse of the equipment you 're carrying and most of them jump to the conclusion that you 're scouting for oil . You can see the hope flame up in their eyes and sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of them do n't believe you after that . It 's a hard thing to murder a poor man 's dream . But Buzby was n't the type . I do n't think he even thought of the oil . He was small and neat and wore -- -C swear it  --  pincc-nez glasses . I could see at a glance he was a city man dropped , like a seed , by the wind . He had been there a long time , certainly . He knew the corn talk and the heat talk , but he would never learn how to come forward in that secure , heavy-shouldered country way , to lean on a car door and talk to strangers while the horizon stayed in his eyes . He invited us , instead , to see his collection of arrowheads . It looked like a good start . We dusted ourselves and followed him in . It was a two-room shack , and about as comfortable as a monk 's cell . It was neat , though , so neat you knew the man lived , rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual back-country bachelor 's quarters . He was precise about his Indian relics as he was precise about everything , but I sensed after a while , a touch of pathos in it  --  the pathos of a man clinging to order in a world where the wind changed the landscape before morning , and not even a dog could help you contain the loneliness of your days . " Someone told me in town you might have a wonderful fossil up here , " I finally ventured , poking in his box of arrowheads , and watching the shy , tense face behind the glasses . " That would be Ned Burner , " he said . " He talks too much . " " I 'd like to see it , " I said , carefully avoiding the word woman , " It might be something of great value to science . " He flushed angrily . In the pause I could hear the wind beating at the tar-paper . " I do n't want any of ' em hereabouts to see it , " he cried passionately . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 'll be gone like  --  like everything . " He stopped , uncertainly aware of his own violence , his dark eyes widening with pain . " We are scientists , Mr. Buzby , " I urged gently . " We 're not here to break anything . We do n't have to tell Ned Burner what we see . " He seemed a little mollified at this , then a doubt struck him . " But you 'd want to take her away , put her in a museum . " I noticed the pronoun , but ignored it . " Mr. Buzby , " I said , " we would very much like to see your discovery . It may be we can tell you more about it that you 'd like to know . It might be that a museum would help you save it from vandals . I 'll leave it to you . if you say no , we wo n't touch it , and we wo n't talk about it in the town , either . That 's fair enough , is n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain that he wanted to show us , but the prospect was half frightening . Oddly enough , I had the feeling his fright revolved around his discovery , more than fear of the townspeople . As he talked on , I began to see what he wanted . He intended to show it to us in the hope we would confirm his belief that it was a petrified woman . The whole thing seemed to have taken on a tremendous importance in his mind . At that point , I could n't fathom his reasons . Anyhow , he had something . At the back of the house we found the skull of a big , long-horned , extinct bison hung up under the eaves . It was a nice find , and we coveted it . " It needs a dose of alavar for preservation , " I said . " The Museum would be the place for a fine specimen like this . It will just go slowly to pieces here . " Buzby was not unattentive . " Maybe , Doctor , maybe . But I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? In the morning --  " " Yes ? " 1 said , trying to keep the eagerness out of my voice . " You think we might --  ? " " No ! Well , yes , all right . But the condi-tions ? They 're like you said ? " " Certainly , " I answered . " It 's very kind of you . " He hardly heard inc . That glaze of pain passed over his face once more . He turned and went into the house without speaking . We did not see him again until morning . The wind goes down into those canyons also . It starts on the flats and rises through them with weird noises , flaking and blasting at every loose stone or leaning pinnacle . It scrapes the sand away from pipy concretions MAGAZINE till they stand out like strange distorted sculptures . It leaves great stones teetering on wine glass stems . I began to suspect what we would find , the moment I came there . Buzby hurried on ahead now , eager and panting . Once he had given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frenzy of haste . Well , it was the usual thing . Up . Down . Up . Over boulders and splintered dead falls of timber . Higher and higher into the back country . Toward the last he outran us , and could n't hear what he was saying . The wind whipped it away . But there he stood , finally , at a niche under the canyon wall . He had his hat off and , for a moment was oblivious to us . He might almost have been praying . Anyhow I stood back and waited for Mack to catch up . " This must be it , " I said to him . " Watch yourself . " Then we stepped forward . I T WAS a concretion , of course , just as I had figured after seeing the wind at work in those miles of canyon . It was n't a bad job , at that . There were sonic bumps in the right places , and a few marks that might be the face , if your imagination was strong . Mine was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a petrified woman into a mastodon femur , and now that was no good either , so 1 just stood and looked . But after the first glance it was Buzby 1 watched . The unskilled eye can build marvels of form where the educated see nothing . I thought of that bison skull under his eaves , and how badly we needed it . He did n't wait for me to speak . He blurted with a terrible intensity that embarrassed me , " She  --  she 's beautiful , is n't she ? " " It 's remarkable , " I said . " Quite remarkable . " And then I just stood there not knowing what to do . He seized on my words with such painful hope that Mack backed off and started looking for fossils in places where he knew perfectly well there were n't any . I did n't catch it all ; I could n't possibly . The words came out in a long , aching torrent , the torrent dammed up for years in the heart of a man not meant for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows , nor the empty bed , nor the neighbors twenty miles away . You 're tough at first . He must have been to stick there . And then suddenly you 're old . You 're old and you 're beaten , and there must be something to talk to and to love . And if you have n't got it you 'll make it in your head , or out of a stone in a canyon wall . He had found her , and he had a myth of how she came there , and now he came up and talked to her in the long afternoon heat while the dust devils danced in his failing corn . It was progressive . I saw the symptoms . In another year , she would be talking to him . " It 's true , is n't it , Doctor ? " he asked me , looking up with that rapt face , after kneeling beside the niche . You can see it 's her . You can see it plain as day . " For the life of me I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brain of a living man who must have loved somebody once , beyond words and reason . " Now Mr. Buzby , " I started to say then , and Mack came up and looked at me . This , in general , is when you launch into a careful explanation of how concretions are made so that the layman will not make the same mistake again . Mack just stood there looking at me in that stolid way of his . I could n't go on with it . I could n't even say it . But I saw where this was going to end . I saw it suddenly and too late . I opened my mouth while little Mr. Buzby held his hands and tried to regain his composure . I opened any mouth and I lied in a way to damn me forever in the halls of science . I LIED , looking across at Mack , and I could feel myself getting redder every moment . It was a stupendous , a colossal lie . " Mr. Buzby . " I said , " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a remarkable case of preservation . We must have it for the Museum . " The light . in his face was beautiful . He believed me now . He believed himself . He came up to the niche again , and touched her lovingly . " It 's okay , " I whispered to Mack . " We wo n't have to pack the thing out . He 'll never give her up . " That 's where I was a fool . He came up to me. his eyes troubled and unsure , but very patient . think you 're right , Doctor , " he said . " It 's selfish of me . She 'll be safer with yon . If site stays here somebody will smash her . I 'm not well . " He sat down on a rock and wiped his forehead . " I 'm sure I 'm not well . I 'm sure she 'll he safer with you . Only I do n't want her in a glass case where people can stare at her . If you can promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , meeting Mack 's eyes across Buzby 's shoulder . " And if I come there I can see her ? " I knew I would never meet him again in this life . " Yes , " I said , " you can see her there . " waited , and then I said , " We 'll get the picks and plaster ready . Now that bison skull at your house . . . " It was two days later , in the truck that Mack spoke to me . " Doc . " " Yeah . " " You know what the Old Man is going to say about shipping that concretion . It 's heavy . Must be three hundred pounds with the plaster . " " Yes , I know . " Mack was pulling up slow along the abutment of a bridge . It was the canyon of the big Piney , a hundred miles away . He got out and went to the rear of the truck . I did n't say anything , but I followed him back . " Doc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I took one end , and we heaved together . It 's a long drop in the big Piney . I did n't look , but I heard it break on the stones . " I wish I had n't done that , " I said . " It was only a concretion , " Mack answered . " The old geezer wo n't know . " " I do n't like it , " I said . " Another week in that wind and I 'd have believed in her myself . Get me the hell out of here  --  maybe I do , anyhow . I tell you I do n't like it . I do n't like it at all . " " It 's a hundred more to Valentine , " Mack said . He put the map in the car pocket and slid over and gave me the wheel .
