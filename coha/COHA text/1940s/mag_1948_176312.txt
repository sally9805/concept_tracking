The five-year-old Lasker Awards are among the world 's top medical honors . As prizes go , their value is small : the biggest single prize , given with a gold reproduction of Winged Victory , ' is $2,500 . Lasker Awards impress scientists because they are " working prizes . " They usually skip the obvious , heavily laureled choices and reward men or groups who have done jobs that the public does n't know much about . <P> Last week the award committees were polishing up the citations for next month 's announcement of the 1948 winners . Nobody was telling , yet , who had won-and medical men were busily speculating . One who knows for sure who the winners will be is Mrs. Mary Lasker , vice president and dynamo behind the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation . Mrs. Lasker puts up the cash , but the winners are picked by three organizations : the American Public Health Association , the National Committee for Mental Hygiene , the Planned Parenthood Federation . <P> Mrs. Lasker , a chic 48 , got interested many years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An old friend once asked for a $500 loan to send her mother to a hospital for treatment of cancer . Mrs. Lasker gave her the money , but it was too late . When the money had to be used for the mother 's funeral , " that did it . " <P> Mary Lasker has long been used to handling money ; she started a dress pattern business ( Hollywood Patterns ) which boomed for 17 years . She was also a successful art dealer ( she divorced her first husband , Art Dealer Paul Reinhardt , in 1934 ) . In 1940 she married Albert D. Lasker ; two years later he liquidated his rich advertising firm , Lord &; Thomas , to busy himself with good works in science and medicine . Both the Laskers are interested in " finding out what is wrong , then helping people who try to clean up the mess . " <P> The Lasker Foundation , formed in 1942 , reflects the varied Lasker interests : fellowships for graduate students working with Sir Howard Florey , co-discoverer of penicillin ( he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the University of Chicago 's Dr. Charles B. Huggins ( his projects ) ; research in hardening of the arteries , headed by Dr. Forrest Kendall at Manhattan 's Goldwater Hospital . <P> Mrs. Lasker 's house on Manhattan 's stylish Beekman Place is decorated with paintings ( by Dali , Picasso , Matisse ) from her art-dealer days . But her real interest now is the foundation and the awards . Says she : " One human being on fire can do so much and nobody was paying much attention to the fire that came from these men . " The awards , she thinks , may fan the fire a bit .
