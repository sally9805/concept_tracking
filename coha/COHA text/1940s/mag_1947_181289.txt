Gloomily the delegates trooped down the green and yellow carpet of Dublin 's Leinster House and into the dimly lit Dail Chamber . " Like mourners , " cracked a newsman , " heavy with the wake 's hangover , for the funeral of Kathleen ni Houlihan . " Throughout the war stubborn , belligerently neutral Eire had feasted while the rest of the world fought . But last week the feast was over and the grim specter of famine lowered over Eire . Newspaper headlines were black with pessimism , as Eire 's editors recalled the great Famine of 1847 , when a blight had turned Ireland 's young potato plants to withered stalks , leaving a million Irish dead of starvation , and sending a million-odd more to the green fields of America. * In that grim year , reported the official Census of Ireland , " starving people lived on the carcasses of diseased cattle , dogs and dead horses . " Was this year , Irishmen asked one another , to be another " Black ' 47 " ? <P> The Government had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sun-spots , " snapped mystic mathematician Premier Eamon de Valera at his critics . And while Dev doodled oversize hieroglyphics , at his side nervous , lanky Agriculture Minister Patrick Smith could only assure the Dail that " with the help of God " the weather would mend . " I have faith in the mercy of God , " piously echoed an Opposition frontbencher . Like the Government , the Opposition had no further ideas . <P> Already Eire 's farmers were six weeks behind in their plowing . Only a tenth of the usual winter wheat crop had been planted , and there were no potatoes and little spring wheat yet in the ground . <P> Since January , blizzard after blizzard had struck Eire , until three-quarters of the land was covered with a two-foot layer of granite-hard ice . There is a tradition that on March 17 Saint Patrick turns " the stone warm side up " to make the soft , drying west wind blow over Ireland . Two days before the Saint 's day , a thaw came , but with it a ten-hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in swollen anger , flooding the lush valleys in Meath , Carlow , Athlone , Cork and Wexford . In Kilkenny town the floods were the worst in living memory. * <P> While " cot-fishing crews " ( four men with two flat-bottomed boats known as currachs or cots ) rescued householders from upper-story windows , watchers on the hills knelt in the downpour and recited the Rosary . Confessionals and prayer-stools floated out of church doors . On the Galtee slopes above Tipperary , sheep , terrified by the mountain torrents , fled to the valley , leaving their lambs to perish . It had never happened before . <P> " Everybody who has a bit of ground in which he can sow wheat must do it , " clarioned Dev . But Eire 's farmers knew that , with all the good intentions in the world , they could do nothing until the rains stopped and the drying winds began to blow . " We did n't need Patrick Smith to tell us we depended on God , " they said .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
