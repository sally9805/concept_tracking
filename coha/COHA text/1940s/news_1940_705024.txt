Fairless , president of U S. Steel , detended the past policy of the corporation in not scrapping so-called obsolete productive equipment in recent years .

Mr. Fairless said criticism by certain governmental agencies that the steel industry had too much capacity now had shifted to current criticism that the industry does not have enough capacity . Mr. Fairless pointed out that the corporation still had a considerable amount of unused bessemer steel capacity and that he thought this type of steel would be in greater demand soon .
