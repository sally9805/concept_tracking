p glossy pillow reposes , and a trailing shrub has softly rested a rich , crimson flower against it . Well mayst thou seek that pillow , thou odoriferous flower , thought Pierre ; not an hour ago , her own cheek must have rested there . " Lucy ! " " Pierre ! " As heart rings to heart those voices rang , and for a moment , in the bright hush of the morning , the two stood silently but ardently eying each other , beholding mutual reflections of a boundless admiration and love . " Nothing but Pierre , " laughed the youth , at last ; " thou hast forgotten to bid me good morning . " " That would be little . Good mornings , good evenings , good days , weeks , months , and years to thee , Pierre ; ? bright Pierre ! ? Pierre ! " Truly , thought the youth , with a still gaze of inexpressible fondness ; truly the skies do ope , and this invoking angel looks down . " I would return thee thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thou hadst lived through a night ; and by heaven , thou belong st to the regions of an infinite day ! " " Fie , now , Pierre ; why should ye youths always swear when ye love ? " " Because in us love is profane , since it mortally reaches toward the heaven in ye ! " " There thou fly'st again , Pierre ; thou art always circumventing me so . Tell me , why should ye youths ever show so sweet an expertness in turning all trifles of ours into trophies of yours ? " " I know not how that is , but ever was it our fashion to do . " And shaking the casement shrub , he dislodged the flower , and conspicuously fastened it in his bosom . " I must away now , Lucy ; see ! under these colors I march . " " Bravissimo ! oh , my only recruit ! " Pierre was the only son of an affluent , and haughty widow ; a lady who externally furnished a singular example of the preservative and beautifying influences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined to a fine mind of medium culture , un-  | cankered by any inconsolable grief , and never worn by sordid cares . In mature age , the rose still miraculously clung to her cheek ; litheness had not yet completely uncoiled itself from her waist , nor smoothness unscrolled itself from her brow , nor diamondness departed from her eyes . So that when lit up and bediademed by ball-room lights , Mrs. Glendinning still eclipsed far younger charms , and had she chosen to encourage them , would have been followed by a train of infatuated suitors , little less young than her own son Pierre . But a reverential and devoted son seemed lover enough for this widow Bloom ; and besides all this , Pierre when namelessly annoyed , and sometimes even jealously transported by the too i ardent admiration of the handsome youths , who now and then , caught in unintended snares , seemed to entertain some insane hopes of wedding this unattainable being ; Pierre had more than once , with a playful malice , openly sworn , that the mangray-beard , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , that man would by some peremptory unrevealed agency immediately disappear from the earth . This romantic filial love of Pierre seemed fully returned by the triumphant maternal pride of the widow , who in the clearcut lineaments and noble air of the son , saw her own graces strangely translated into the opposite sex . There was a striking personal resemblance between them ; and as the mother seemed to have long stood still in her beauty , heedless of the passing years ; so Pierre seemed to meet her half-way , and by a splendid precocity of form and feature , almost advanced himself to that mature stand-point in Time , where his pedestaled mother so long had stood . In the playfulness of their unclouded love , and with that strange licence which a perfect confidence and mutual understanding at all points , had long bred between them , they were wont to call each other brother and sister . Both in public and private this was their usage ; nor when thrown among strangers , was this mode of address ever suspected for a sportful assumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youthful pretension. ? Thus freely and lightsomely for mother and son flowed on the pure joined current of life . But as yet the fair river had not borne its waves to  | those sideways repelling rocks , where it was thenceforth destined to be forever divided into two unmixing streams . An excellent English author of these times enumerating the prime advantages of his natal lot , cites foremost , that he first saw the rural light . So with Pierre . It had been his choice fate to have been born and nurtured in the country , surrounded by scenery whose uncommon loveliness was the perfect mold of a delicate and poetic mind ; while the popular names of its finest features appealed to the proudest patriotic and family associations of the historic line of Glendinning . On the meadows which sloped away from the shaded rear of the manorial mansion , far to the winding river , an Indian battle had been fought , in the earlier days of the colony , and in that battle the paternal greatgrandfather of Pierre , mortally wounded , had sat unhorsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , still cheering his men in the fray . This was Saddle Meadows , a name likewise extended to the mansion and the village . Far beyond these plains , a day 's walk for Pierre , rose the storied heights , where in the Revolutionary War his grandfather had for several months defended a rude but all-important stockaded fort , against the reheated combined assaults of Indians , Tories , and Regulars . From before that fort , the gentlemanly , but murderous half-breed , Brant , had fled , but had survived to dine with General Glendinning , in the amicable times which followed that vindictive war . All the associations of Saddle Meadows were full of pride to Pierre . The Glendinning deeds by which their estate had so long been held , bore the ciphers of three Indian kings , the aboriginal and only conveyancers of those noble woods and plains . Thus loftily , in the days of his circumscribed youth , did Pierre glance along the background of his race ; little reeking of that maturer and larger interior development , which should forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his soul . But the breeding of Pierre would have been unwisely contracted , had his youth been unintermittingly passed in these rural scenes . At a very early period he had begun to accompany his father and mother  --  and afterwards his mother alone  --  in their annual visits to the city ; where naturally mingling in a  | large and polished society , Pierre had insensibly formed himself in the airier graces of life , without enfeebling the vigor derived from a martial race , and fostered in the country 's clarion air . Nor while thus liberally developed in person and manners , was Pierre deficient in a still better and finer culture . Not in vain had he spent long summer afternoons in the deep recesses of his father 's fastidiously picked and decorous library ; where the Spenserian nymphs had early led him into many a maze of allbewildering beauty . Thus , with a graceful glow on his limbs , and soft , imaginative flames in his heart , did this Pierre glide toward maturity , thoughtless of that period of remorseless insight , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he should madly demand more ardent fires . Nor had that pride and love which had so bountifully provided for the youthful nurture of Pierre , neglected his culture in the deepest element of all . It had been a maxim with the father of Pierre , that all gentlemanhood was vain ; all claims to it preposterous and absurd , unless the primeval gentleness and golden humanities of religion had been so thoroughly wrought into the complete texture of the character , that he who pronounced himself gentleman , could also rightfully assume the meek , but kingly style of Christian . At the age of sixteen , Pierre partook with his mother of the Holy Sacraments . It were needless , and more difficult , perhaps , to trace out precisely the absolute motives which prompted these youthful vows . Enough , that as to Pierre had descended the numerous other noble qualities of his ancestors ; and as he now stood heir to their forests and farms ; so by the same insensible sliding process , he seemed to have inherited their docile homage to a venerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from beneath the shadow of an English minster . Thus in Pierre was the complete polished steel of the gentleman , girded with Religion 's silken sash ; and his great-grandfather 's soldierly fate had taught him that the generous sash should , in the last bitter trial , furnish its wearer with Glory 's shroud ; so that what through life had been worn for Grace 's sake , in death might  | safely hold the man . But while thus all alive to the beauty and poesy of his father 's faith , Pierre little foresaw that this world hath a secret deeper than beauty , and Life some burdens heavier than death . So perfect to Pierre had long seemed the illuminated scroll of his life thus far , that only one hiatus was discoverable by him in that sweetly-writ manuscript . A sister had been omitted from the text . He mourned that so delicious a feeling as fraternal love had been denied him . Nor could the fictitious title , which he so often lavished upon his mother , at all supply the absent reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause and reason of it even Pierre did not at that time entirely appreciate . For surely a gentle sister is the second best gift to a man ; and it is first in point of occurrence ; for the wife comes after . He who is sisterless , is as a bachelor before his time . For much that goes to make up the deliciousness of a wife , already lies in the sister . " Oh , had my father but had a daughter ! " cried Pierre ; " some one whom I might love , and protect , and fight for , if need be . It must be a glorious thing to engage in a mortal quarrel on a sweet sister 's behalf ! Now , of all things , would to heaven , I had a sister ! " Thus , ere entranced in the gentler bonds of a lover ; thus often would Pierre invoke heaven for a sister ; but Pierre did not then know , that if there be any thing a man might well pray against , that thing is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth . It may have been that this strange yearning of Pierre for a sister , had part of its origin in that still stranger feeling of loneliness he sometimes experienced , as not only the solitary head of his family , but the only surnamed male Glendinning extant . A powerful and populous family had by degrees run off into the female branches ; so that Pierre found himself surrounded by numerous kinsmen and kinswomen , yet companioned by no surnamed male Glendinning , but the duplicate one reflected to him in the mirror . But in his more wonted natural mood , this thought was not wholly sad to him . Nay , sometimes it mounted into an exultant swell . For in the ruddiness , and flushfulness ,  | and vain-gloriousness of his youthful soul , he fondly hoped to have a monopoly of glory in capping the fame-column , whose tall shaft had been erected by his noble sires . In all this , how unadmonished was our Pierre by that foreboding and prophetic lesson taught , not less by Palmyra 's quarries , than by Palmyra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncompleted shaft , and some leagues off , ages ago left in the quarry , is the crumbling corresponding capital , also incomplete . These Time seized and spoiled ; these Time crushed in the egg ; and the proud stone that should have stood among the clouds , Time left abased beneath the soil . Oh , what quenchless feud is this , that Time bath with the sons of Men ! It has been said that the beautiful country round about Pierre appealed to very proud memories . But not only through the mere chances of things , had that fine country become ennobled by the deeds of his sires , but in Pierre 's eyes , all its hills and swales seemed as sanctified through their very long uninterrupted possession by his race . That fond ideality which , in the eyes of affection , hallows the least trinket once familiar to the person of a departed love ; with Pierre that talisman touched the whole earthly landscape about him ; for remembering that on those hills his own fine fathers had gazed ; through those woods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tangled paths , many a grand-dame of his had merrily strolled when a girl ; vividly recalling these things , Pierre deemed all that part of the earth a love-token ; so that his very horizon was to him as a memorial ring . The monarchical world very generally imagines , that in demagoguical America the sacred Past hath no fixed statues erected to it , but all things irreverently seethe and boil in the vulgar caldron of an everlasting uncrystalizing Present . This conceit would seem peculiarly applicable to the social condition . With no chartered aristocracy , and no law of entail , how can any family in America imposingly perpetuate itself ? Certainly that common saying among us , which declares , that be a family conspicuous as it may , a single half-century shall see it abased ;  | that maxim undoubtedly holds true with the commonalty . In our cities families rise and burst like bubbles in a vat . For indeed the democratic element operates as a subtile acid among us ; forever producing new things by corroding the old ; as in the south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of green paint , is produced by grape-vinegar poured upon copper plates . Now in general nothing can be more significant of decay than the idea of corrosion ; yet on the other hand , nothing can more vividly suggest luxuriance of life , than the idea of green as a color ; for green is the peculiar signet of all-fertile Nature herself . Herein by apt analogy we behold the marked anomalousness of America ; whose character abroad , we need not be surprised , is misconceived , when we consider how strangely she contradicts all prior notions of human things ; and how wonderfully to her , Death itself becomes transmuted into Life . So that political institutions , which in other lands seem above all things intensely artificial , with America seem to possess the divine virtue of a natural law ; for the most mighty of nature 's laws is this , that out of Death she brings Life . Still , are there things in the visible world , over which evershifting Nature hath not so unbounded a sway . The grass is annually changed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term of years , defy that annual decree . And if in America the vast mass of families be as the blades of grass , yet some few there are that stand as the oak ; which , instead of decaying , annually puts forth new branches ; whereby Time , instead of subtracting , is made to capitulate into a multiple virtue . In this matter we will  --  not superciliously , but in fair spirit ? compare pedigrees with England , and strange as it may seem at the first blush , not without some claim to equality . I dare say , that in this thing the Peerage Book is a good statistical standard whereby to judge her ; since the compilers of that work can not be entirely insensible on whose patronage they most rely ; and the common intelligence of our own people shall suffice to judge us . But the magnificence of names must not mislead us as to the humility of things . For as the breath in all our lungs is hereditary , and my present breath at this moment , is further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | the Jews , so far as he can assuredly trace it ; so mere names , which are also but air , do likewise revel in this endless descendedness . But if Richmond , and St. Albans , and Grafton , and Portland , and Buccleuch , be names almost old as England herself , the present Dukes of those names stop in their own genuine pedigrees at Charles n. , and there find no very fine fountain ; since what we would deem the least glorious parentage under the sun , is precisely the parentage of a Buccleuch , for example ; whose ancestress could not well avoid being a mother , it is true , but had accidentally omitted the preliminary rite . Yet a king was the sire . Then only so much the worse ; for if it be small insult to be struck by a pauper , but mortal offense to receive a blow from a gentleman , then of all things , the bye-blows of kings must be signally unflattering . In England the Peerage is kept alive by incessant restorations and creations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-two peers . An earldom , in abeyance for five centuries , has suddenly been assumed by some commoner , to whom it had not so much descended , as through the art of the lawyers been made flexibly to bend in that direction . For not Thames is so sinuous in his natural course , not the Bridgewater Canal more artificially conducted , than blood in the veins of that winding or manufactured nobility . Perishable as stubble , and fungous as the fungi , those grafted families successively live and die on the eternal soil of a name . In England this day , twenty-five hundred peerages are extinct ; but the names survive . So that the empty air of a name is more endurable than a man , or than dynasties of men ; the air fills man 's lungs and puts life into a man , but man fills not the air , nor puts life into that . All honor to the names then , and all courtesy to the men ; but if St. Albans tell me he is all-honorable and all-eternal , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles ii . very few indeed  --  hardly worthy of note ? are the present titled English families which can trace any thing like a direct unvitiated blood-descent from the thief knights of the Norman . Beyond Charles ii . their direct genealogies seem vain as though some Jew clothesman , with a tea-canister on his head , turned over the first chapter of St. Matthew to  | make out his unmingled participation in the blood of King Saul , who had long died ere the career of the Caesar began . Now , not preliminarily to enlarge upon the fact that , while in England an immense mass of state-masonry is brought to bear as a buttress in upholding the hereditary existence of certain houses , while with us nothing of that kind can possibly be admitted ; and to omit all mention of the hundreds of unobtrusive families in New England who , nevertheless , might easily trace their uninterrupted English lineage to a time before Charles the Blade : not to speak of the old and oriental-like English planter families of Virginia and the South ; the Randolphs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James ' time , married Pocahontas the Indian Princess , and in whose blood therefore an underived aboriginal royalty was flowing over two hundred years ago ; consider those most ancient and magnificent Dutch manors at the North , whose perches are miles  --  whose meadows overspread adjacent counties  --  and whose haughty rent-deeds are held by their thousand farmer-tenants , so long as grass grows and water runs ; which hints of a surprising eternity for a deed , and seems to make lawyer 's ink unobliterable as the sea . Some of those manors are two centuries old ; and their present patroons or lords will show you stakes and stones on their estates put there  --  the stones at least  --  before Nell Cwynne the Duke-mother was born , and genealogies which , like their own river , Hudson , flow somewhat farther and straighter than the Serpentine brooklet in Hyde Park . These far-descended Dutch meadows lie steeped in a Hindooish haze ; an eastern patriarchalness sways its mild crook over pastures , whose tenant flocks shall there feed , long as their own grass grows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to defy Time 's tooth , and by conditions which take hold of the indestructible earth seem to cotemporize their fee-simples with eternity . Unimaginable audacity of a worm that but crawls through the soil he so imperially claims ! In midland counties of England they boast of old oaken dining-halls where three hundred men-at-arms could exercise of a rainy afternoon , in the reign of the Plantagenets . But our lords , the patroons , appeal not to the past , but they point to the pres-  | ent . One will show you that the public census of a county , is but part of the roll of his tenants . Ranges of mountains , high as Ben Nevis or Snowdon , are their walls ; and regular armies , with staffs of officers , crossing rivers with artillery , and marching through primeval woods , and threading vast rocky defiles , have been sent out to distrain upon three thousand farmer-tenants of one landlord , at a blow . A fact most suggestive two ways ; both whereof shall be nameless here . But whatever one may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart of a republic , and however we may wonder at their thus surviving , like Indian mounds , the Revolutionary flood ; yet survive and exist they do , and are now owned by their present proprietors , by as good nominal title as any peasant owns his father 's old hat , or any duke his great-uncle 's old coronet . For all this , then , we shall not err very widely if we humbly conceive , that  --  should she choose to glorify herself in that inconsiderable way  --  our America will make out a good general case with England in this short little matter of large estates , and long pedigrees  --  pedigrees I mean , wherein is no flaw . In general terms we have been thus decided in asserting the great genealogical and real-estate dignity of some families in America , because in so doing we poetically establish the richly aristocratic condition of Master Pierre Glendinning , for whom we have before claimed some special family distinction . And to the observant reader the sequel will not fail to show , how important is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character and most singular life-career of our hero . Nor will any man dream that the last chapter was merely intended for a foolish bravado , and not with a solid purpose in view . Now Pierre stands on this noble pedestal ; we shall see if he keeps that fine footing ; we shall see if Fate bath not just a little bit of a small word or two to say in this world . But it is not laid down here that the Glendinnings dated back beyond Pharaoh , or the deeds of Saddle Meadows to the Three Magi in the Gos-  | pels . Nevertheless , those deeds , as before hinted , did indeed date back to three kings  --  Indian kings  --  only so much the finer for that . But if Pierre did not date back to the Pharaohs , and if the English farmer Hampdens were somewhat the seniors of even the oldest Glendinning ; and if some American manors boasted a few additional years and square miles over his , yet think you that it is at all possible , that a youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing  --  strew his ancestral kitchen hearthstone with wheat in the stalk , and there standing in the chimney thresh out that grain with a flail , whose aerial evolutions had free play among all that masonry ; were it not impossible for such a flailer so to thresh wheat in his own ancestral kitchen chimney without feeling just a little twinge or two of what one might call family pride ? I should say not . Or how think you it would be with this youthful Pierre , if every day descending to breakfast , he caught sight of an old tattered British banner or two , hanging over an arched window in his hall ; and those banners captured by his grandfather , the general , in fair fight ? Or how think you it would be if every time he heard the band of the military company of the village , he should distinctly recognize the peculiar tap of a British kettledrum also captured by his grandfather in fair fight , and afterwards suitably inscribed on the brass and bestowed upon the Saddle Meadows Artillery Corps ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a mild meditative Fourth of July morning in the country , he carried out with him into the garden by way of ceremonial cane , a long , majestic , silver-tipped staff , a MajorGeneral 's baton , once wielded on the plume-nodding and musket-flashing review by the same grandfather several times herein-before mentioned ? I should say that considering Pierre was quite young and very unphilosophical as yet , and withal rather high-blooded ; and sometimes read the History of the Revolutionary War , and possessed a mother who very frequently made remote social allusions to the epaulettes of the Major-General his grandfather ; ? I should say that upon all of these occasions , the way it must have been with him , was a very proud , elated sort of way . And if this seem but too fond and foolish in Pierre ;  | and if you tell me that this sort of thing in him showed him no sterling Democrat , and that a truly noble man should never brag of any arm but his own ; then I beg you to consider again that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe me you will pronounce Pierre a thorough-going Democrat in time ; perhaps a little too Radical altogether to your fancy . In conclusion , do not blame me if I here make repetition , and do verbally quote my own words in saying that it had been the choice fate of Pierre to have been born and bred in the country . For to a noble American youth this indeed  --  more than in any other land  --  this indeed is a most rare and choice lot . For it is to be observed , that while in other countries , the finest families boast of the country as their home ; the more prominent among us , proudly cite the city as their seat . Too often the American that himself makes his fortune , builds him a great metropolitan house , in the most metropolitan street of the most metropolitan town . Whereas a European of the same sort would thereupon migrate into the country . That herein the European hath the better of it , no poet , no philosopher , and no aristocrat will deny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophical , but it is the most aristocratic part of this earth , for it is the most venerable , and numerous bards have ennobled it by many fine titles . Whereas the town is the more plebeian portion : which , besides many other things , is plainly evinced by the dirty unwashed face perpetually worn by the town ; but the country , like any Queen , is ever attended by scrupulous lady 's maids in the guise of the seasons , and the town bath but one dress of brick turned up with stone ; but the country bath a brave dress for every week in the year ; sometimes she changes her dress twenty-four times in the twenty-four hours ; and the country weareth her sun by day as a diamond on a Queen 's brow ; and the stars by night as necklaces of gold beads ; whereas the town 's sun is smoky paste , and no diamond , and the town 's stars are pinchbeck and not gold . In the country then Nature planted our Pierre ; because Nature intended a rare and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved ambiguous to him in the end ; never-  | theless , in the beginning she did bravely . She blew her windclarion from the blue hills , and Pierre neighed out lyrical thoughts , as at the trumpet-blast , a war-horse paws himself into a lyric of foam . She whispered through her deep groves at eve , and gentle whispers of humanness , and sweet whispers of love , ran through Pierre 's thought-veins , musical as water over pebbles . She lifted her spangled crest of a thickly-starred night , and forth at that glimpse of their divine Captain and Lord , ten thousand mailed thoughts of heroicness started up in Pierre 's soul , and glared round for some insulted good cause to defend . So the country was a glorious benediction to young Pierre ; we shall see if that blessing pass from him as did the di , vine blessing from the Hebrews ; we shall yet see again , I say , whether Fate bath not just a little bit of a word or two to say in this world ; we shall see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far out of the way  --  Nemo contra Deum nisi Deus ipse . " Sister Mary , " said Pierre , returned from his sunrise stroll , and tapping at his mother 's chamber door : ? " do you know , sister Mary , that the trees which have been up all night , are all abroad again this morning before you ? ? Do you not smell something like coffee , my sister ? " A light step moved from within toward the door ; which opened , showing Mrs. Glendinning , in a resplendently cheerful morning robe , and holding a gay wide ribbon in her hand . " Good morning , Madam , " said Pierre , slowly , and with a bow , whose genuine and spontaneous reverence amusingly contrasted with the sportive manner that had preceded it . For thus sweetly and religiously was the familiarity of his affections bottomed on the profoundest filial respect . " Good afternoon to you , Pierre , for I suppose it is afternoon . But come , you shall finish my toilet ; ? here , brother " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ? and seating herself away from the glass , she awaited the good offices of Pierre . " First Lady in waiting to the Dowager Duchess Glendinning , "  | laughed Pierre , as bowing over before his mother , he gracefully passed the ribbon round her neck , simply crossing the ends in front . " Well , what is to hold it there , Pierre ? " " I am going to try and tack it with a kiss , sister , ? there ! ? oh , what a pity that sort of fastening wo n't always hold ! ? where 's the cameo with the fawns , I gave you last night ? ? Ah ! on the slab  --  you were going to wear it then ? ? Thank you , my considerate and most politic sister  --  there ! ? but stop  --  here 's a ringlet gone romping  --  so now , dear sister , give that Assyrian toss to your head . " The haughtily happy mother rose to her feet , and as she stood before the mirror to criticize her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her slipper , knelt down and secured it . " And now for the urn , " he cried , " Madam ! " and with a humorous gallantry , offering his arm to his mother , the pair descended to breakfast . With Mrs. Glendinning it was one of those spontaneous maxims , which women sometimes act upon without ever thinking of , never to appear in the presence of her son in any dishabille that was not eminently becoming . Her own independent observation of things , had revealed to her many very common maxims , which often become operatively lifeless from a vicarious reception of them . She was vividly aware how immense was that influence , which , even in the closest ties of the heart , the merest appearances make upon the mind . And as in the admiring love and graceful devotion of Pierre lay now her highest joy in life ; so she omitted no slightest trifle which could possibly contribute to the preservation of so sweet and flattering a thing . Besides all this , Mary Glendinning was a woman , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanity it can be called  --  which in a life of nearly fifty years had never betrayed her into a single published impropriety , or caused her one known pang at the heart . Moreover , she had never yearned for admiration ; because that was her birthright by the eternal privilege of beauty ; she had always possessed it ; she had not to turn her head for it , since spontaneously it always encompassed her . Vanity , which in so many women approaches to a spiritual vice ,  | and therefore to a visible blemish ; in her peculiar case  --  and though possessed in a transcendent degree  --  was still the token of the highest health ; inasmuch as never knowing what it was to yearn for its gratification , she was almost entirely unconscious of possessing it at all . Many women carry this light of their lives flaming on their foreheads ; but Mary Glendinning unknowingly bore hers within . Through all the infinite traceries of feminine art , she evenly glowed like a vase which , internally illuminated , gives no outward sign of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very virtue of the exquisite marble itself . But that bluff corporeal admiration , with which some ball-room women are content , was no admiration to the mother of Pierre . Not the general homage of men , but the selected homage of the noblest men , was what she felt to be her appropriate right . And as her own maternal partialities were added to , and glorified the rare and absolute merits of Pierre ; she considered the voluntary allegiance of his affectionate soul , the representative fealty of the choicest guild of his race . Thus , though replenished through all her veins with the subtlest vanity , with the homage of Pierre alone she was content . But as to a woman of sense and spirit , the admiration of even the noblest and most gifted man , is esteemed as nothing , so long as she remains conscious of possessing no directly influencing and practical sorcery over his soul ; and as notwithstanding all his intellectual superiority to his mother , Pierre , through the unavoidable weakness of inexperienced and unexpanded youth , was strangely docile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus far had any ways interested or affected him ; therefore it was , that to Mary Glendinning this reverence of Pierre was invested with all the proudest delights and witcheries of self-complacency , which it is possible for the most conquering virgin to feel . Still more . That nameless and infinitely delicate aroma of inexpressible tenderness and attentiveness which , in every refined and honorable attachment , is cotemporary with the courtship , and precedes the final banns and the rite ; but which , like the bouquet of the costliest German wines , too often evaporates upon pouring love out to drink , in the disenchanting glasses of the matrimonial days and nights ; this highest and  | airiest thing in the whole compass of the experience of our mortal life ; this heavenly evanescence  --  still further etherealized in the filial breast  --  was for Mary Glendinning , now not very far from her grand climacteric , miraculously revived in the courteous lover-like adoration of Pierre . Altogether having its origin in a wonderful but purely fortuitous combination of the happiest and rarest accidents of earth ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is so fatal to ordinary love ; this softened spell which still wheeled the mother and son in one orbit of joy , seemed a glimpse of the glorious possibility , that the divinest of those emotions , which are incident to the sweetest season of love , is capable of an indefinite translation into many of the less signal relations of our many chequered life . In a detached and individual way , it seemed almost to realize here below the sweet dreams of those religious enthusiasts , who paint to us a Paradise to come , when etherealized from all drosses and stains , the holiest passion of man shall unite all kindreds and climes in one circle of pure and unimpairable delight . There was one little uncelestial trait , which , in the opinion of some , may mar the romantic merits of the gentlemanly Pierre Glendinning . He always had an excellent appetite , and especially for his breakfast . But when we consider that though Pierre 's hands were small , and his ruffles white , yet his arm was by no means dainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he generally rose with the sun , and could not sleep without riding his twenty , or walking his twelve miles a day , or felling a fair-sized hemlock in the forest , or boxing , or fencing , or boating , or performing some other gymnastical feat ; when we consider these athletic habitudes of Pierre , and the great fullness of brawn and muscle they built round about him ; all of which manly brawn and muscle , three times a day loudly clamored for attention ; we shall very soon perceive that to have a bountiful appetite , was not only no vulgar reproach , but a right royal grace and honor to Pierre ; attesting him a man and a gen-  | tleman ; for a thoroughly developed gentleman is always robust and healthy ; and Robustness and Health are great trenchermen . So when Pierre and his mother descended to breakfast , and Pierre had scrupulously seen her supplied with whatever little things were convenient to her ; and had twice or thrice ordered the respectable and immemorial Dates , the servitor , to adjust and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air should take undue liberties with his mother 's neck ; after seeing to all this , but in a very quiet and inconspicuous way ; and also after directing the unruffled Dates , to swing out , horizontally into a particular light , a fine joyous painting , in the goodfellow , Flemish style ( which painting was so attached to the wall as to be capable of that mode of adjusting ) , and furthermore after darting from where he sat a few invigorating glances over the river-meadows to the blue mountains beyond ; Pierre made a masonic sort of mysterious motion to the excellent Dates , who in automaton obedience thereto , brought from a certain agreeable little side-stand , a very prominent-looking cold pasty ; which , on careful inspection with the knife , proved to be the embossed savory nest of a few uncommonly tender pigeons of Pierre 's own shooting . " Sister Mary , " said he , lifting on his silver trident one of the choicest of the many fine pigeon morsels ; " sister Mary , " said he , " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down one in such a manner that the breast is entirely unmarred . It was intended for you ! and here it is . Now Sergeant Dates , help hither your mistress ' plate . No ? ? nothing but the crumbs of French rolls , and a few peeps into a coffee-cup  --  is that a breakfast for the daughter of yonder bold General ? " ? pointing to a full-length of his gold-laced grandfather on the opposite wall . " Well , pitiable is my case when I have to breakfast for two . Dates ! " " Sir . " " Remove that toast-rack , Dates ; and this plate of tongue , and bring the rolls nearer , and wheel the stand farther off , good Dates . "  | Having thus made generous room for himself , Pierre commenced operations , interrupting his mouthfuls by many sallies of mirthfulness . " You seem to be in prodigious fine spirits this morning , brother Pierre , " said his mother . " Yes , very tolerable ; at least I ca n't say , that I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine fellow , bring me three bowls of milk . " " One bowl , sir , you mean , " said Dates , gravely and imperturbably . As the servitor left the room , Mrs. Glendinning spoke . " My dear Pierre , how often have I begged you never to permit your hilariousness to betray you into overstepping the exact line of propriety in your intercourse with servants . Dates ' look was a respectful reproof to you just now . You must not call Dates , My fine fellow . He is a fine fellow , a very fine fellow , indeed ; but there is no need of telling him so at my table . It is very easy to be entirely kind and pleasant to servants , without the least touch of any shade of transient good-fellowship with them . " " Well , sister , no doubt you are altogether right ; after this I shall drop the fine , and call Dates nothing but fellow ; ? Fellow , come here ! ? how will that answer ? " " Not at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so for the present I pass over your nonsense . " " Romeo ! oh , no . I am far from being Romeo ? " sighed Pierre . " I laugh , but he cried ; poor Romeo ! alas Romeo ! woe is me , Romeo ! he came to a very deplorable end , did Romeo , sister Mary . " " It was his own fault though . " " Poor Romeo ! " " He was disobedient to his parents . " " Alas Romeo ! " " He married against their particular wishes . " " Woe is me , Romeo ! " " But you , Pierre , are going to be married before long , I trust , not to a Capulet , but to one of our own Montagues ; and so Romeo 's evil fortune will hardly be yours . You will be happy . " " The more miserable Romeo ! "  | " Do n't be so ridiculous , brother Pierre ; so you are going to take Lucy that long ride among the hills this morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl . " " " Yes , that is rather my opinion , sister Mary. ? By heavens , mother , the five zones hold not such another ! She is  --  yes ? though I say it  --  Dates ! ? he 's a precious long time getting that milk ! " " Let him stay. ? Do n't be a milk-sop , Pierre ! " " Ha ! my sister is a little satirical this morning . I comprehend . " " Never rave , Pierre ; and never rant . Your father never did either ; nor is it written of Socrates ; and both were very wise men . Your father was profoundly in love  --  that I know to my certain knowledge  --  but I never heard him rant about it . He was always exceedingly gentlemanly : and gentlemen never rant . Milk-sops and Muggletonians rant , but gentlemen never . " " Thank you , sister. ? There , put it down , Dates ; are the horses ready ? " " Just driving round , sir , I believe . " " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the window , " arc you going to Santa Fe 1 ) e Bogota with that enormous old phaeton ; ? what do you take that Juggernaut out for ? " " Humor , sister , humor ; I like it because it 's old-fashioned , and because the seat is such a wide sofa of a seat , and finally because a young lady by the name of Lucy Tartan cherishes a high regard for it . She vows she would like to be married in it " " Well , Pierre , all I have to say , is , be sure that Christopher puts the coach-hammer and nails , and plenty of cords and screws into the box . And you had better let him follow you in one of the farm-wagons , with a spare axle and some boards . " " No fear , sister ; no fear ; ? I shall take the best of care of the old phaeton . The quaint old arms on the panel , always remind me who it was that first rode in it " " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And who it was that next rode in it . " " Bless you ! ? God bless you , my dear son ! ? always think of him and you can never err ; yes , always think of your dear perfect father , Pierre . " " Well , kiss me now , dear sister , for I must go . "  | " There ; this is my cheek , and the other is Lucy 's ; though now that I look at them both , I think that hers is getting to be the most blooming ; sweeter dews fall on that one , I suppose . " Pierre laughed , and ran out of the room , for old Christopher was getting impatient . His mother went to the window and stood there . " A noble boy , and docile " ? she murmured ? " he has all the frolicsomeness of youth , with little of its giddiness . And he does not grow vain-glorious in sophomorean wisdom . I thank heaven ' I sent him not to college . A noble boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , docile , vigorous boy . Pray God , he never becomes otherwise to me . His little wife , that is to be , will not estrange him from me ; for she too is docile , ? beautiful , and reverential , and most docile . Seldom yet have I known such blue eyes as hers , that were not docile , and would not follow a bold black one , as two meek blue-ribboned ewes follow their martial leader . How glad am I that Pierre loves her so , and not some dark-eyed haughtiness , with whom I could never live in peace ; but who would be ever setting her young married state before my elderly widowed one , and claiming all the homage of my dear boy ? the fine , proud , loving , docile , vigorous boy ! ? the lofty-minded , well-born , noble boy ; and with such sweet docilities ! See his hair ! He does in truth illustrate that fine saying of his father 's , that as the noblest colts , in three points  --  abundant hair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine woman , so should a noble youth . Well , good-bye , Pierre , and a merry morning to ye ! " So saying she crossed the room , and  --  resting in a corner  --  her glad proud eye met the old General 's baton , which the day before in one of his frolic moods Pierre had taken from its accustomed place in the pictured-bannered hall . She lifted it , and musingly swayed it to and fro ; then paused , and staff-wise rested with it in her hand . Her stately beauty had ever somewhat martial in it ; and now she looked the daughter of a General , as she was ; for Pierre 's was a double revolutionary descent . On both sides he sprung from heroes . " This is his inheritance  --  this symbol of command ! and I swell out to think it . Yet but just now I fondled the conceit that  | Pierre was so sweetly docile ! Here sure is a most strange inconsistency ! For is sweet docility a general 's badge ? and is this baton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong . Now I almost wish him otherwise than sweet and docile to me , seeing that it must be hard for man to be an uncompromising hero and a commander among his race , and yet never ruffle any domestic brow . Pray heaven he show his heroicness in some smooth way of favoring fortune , not be called out to be a hero of some dark hope forlorn ; ? of some dark hope forlorn , whose cruelness makes a savage of a man . Give him , 0 God , regardful gales ! Fan him with unwavering prosperitiesl So shall he remain all docility to me , and yet prove a haughty hero to the world ! " '  | ON THE previous evening , Pierre had arranged with Lucy the plan of a long winding ride , among the hills which stretched around to the southward from the wide plains of Saddle Meadows . Though the vehicle was a sexagenarian , the animals that drew it , were but six-year colts . The old phaeton had outlasted several generations of its drawers . Pierre rolled beneath the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the white cottage door . Flinging his reins upon the ground he entered the house . The two colts were his particular and confidential friends ; born on the same land with him , and fed with the same corn , which , in the form of Indian-cakes , Pierre himself was often wont to eat for breakfast . The same fountain that by one branch supplied the stables with water , by another supplied Pierre 's pitcher . They were a sort of family cousins to Pierre , those horses ; and they were splendid young cousins ; very showy in their redundant manes and mighty paces , but not at all vain or arrogant . They acknowledged Pierre as the undoubted head of the house of Glendinning . They well knew that they were but au inferior and subordinate branch of the Glendinnings , bound in perpetual feudal fealty to its headmost representative . ThereI ore , these young cousins never permitted themselves to run from Pierre ; they were impatient in their paces , but very patient  | in the halt . They were full of good-humor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how can you let them stand all alone that way , Pierre , " cried Lucy , as she and Pierre stepped forth from the cottage door , Pierre laden with shawls , parasol , reticule , and a small hamper . " Wait a bit , " cried Pierre , dropping his load ; " I will show you what my colts are . " So saying , he spoke to them mildly , and went close up to them , and patted them . The colts neighed ; the nigh colt neighing a little jealously , as if Pierre had not patted impartially . Then , with a low , long , almost inaudible whistle , Pierre got between the colts , among the harness . Whereat Lucy started , and uttered a faint cry , but Pierre told her to keep perfectly quiet , for there was not the least danger in the world . And Lucy did keep quiet ; for somehow , though she always started when Pierre seemed in the slightest jeopardy , yet at bottom she rather cherished a notion that Pierre bore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die from her , or experience any harm , when she was within a thousand leagues . Pierre , still between the horses , now stepped upon the pole of the phaeton ; then stepping down , indefinitely disappeared , or became partially obscured among the living colonnade of the horses ' eight slender and glossy legs . He entered the colonnade one way , and after a variety of meanderings , came out another way ; during all of which equestrian performance , the two colts kept gayly neighing , and good-humoredly moving their heads perpendicularly up and down ; and sometimes turning them sideways toward Lucy ; as much as to say  --  We understand young master ; we understand him , Miss ; never fear , pretty lady : why , bless your delicious little heart , we played with Pierre before you ever did . " Are you afraid of their running away now , Lucy ? " said Pierre , returning to her . " Not much , Pierre ; the superb fellows ! Why , Pierre , they have made an officer of you  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoulders . " Bravissimo again ! I called you  | my recruit , when you left my window this morning , and here you are promoted . " " Very prettily conceited , Lucy . But see , you do n't admire their coats ; they wear nothing but the finest Genoa velvet , Lucy . See ! did you ever see such well-groomed horses ? " " Never ! " " Then what say you to have them for my groomsmen , Lucy ? GIorious groomsmen they would make , I declare . They should have a hundred ells of white favors all over their manes and tails ; and when they drew us to church , they would be still all the time scattering white favors from their mouths , just as they did here on me . Upon my soul , they shall be my groomsmen , Lucy . Stately stags ! playful dogs ! heroes , Lucy . We shall have la ) marriage bells ; they shall neigh for us , Lucy ; we shall be wedded to the martial sound of Job 's trumpeters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of it . " " Neighing at your lyrics , Pierre . Come , let us be off . Here , the shawl , the parasol , the basket : what are you looking at them so for ? " " I was thinking , Lucy , of the sad state I am in . Not six months ago , I saw a poor affianced fellow , an old comrade of mine , trudging along with his Lucy Tartan , a hillock of bundles under either arm ; and I said to myself  --  There goes a sumpter , now ; poor devil , he 's a lover . And now look at me ! Well , life 's a burden , they say ; why not be burdened cheerily ? But look ye , Lucy , I am going to enter a formal declaration and protest before matters go further with us . When we are married , I am not to carry any bundles , unless in cases of real need ; and what is more , when there are any of your young lady acquaintances in sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back up , and load for their particular edification . " " Now I am really vexed with you , Pierre ; that is the first illnatured innuendo I ever heard from you . Are there any of my young lady acquaintances in sight now , I should like to know ? " " Six of them , right over the way , " said Pierre ; " but they keep behind the curtains . I never trust your solitary village streets , Lucy . Sharp-shooters behind every clap-board , Lucy . " " Pray , then , dear Pierre , do let us be off ! "  | While Pierre and Lucy are now rolling along under the elms , let it be said who Lucy Tartan was . It is needless to say that she was a beauty ; because chestnut-haired , bright-cheeked youths like Pierre Glendinning , seldom fall in love with any but a beauty . And in the times to come , there must be  --  as in the present times , and in the times gone by  --  some splendid men , and some transcendent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always , throughout all time , here and there , a handsome youth weds with a handsome maid ? But though owing to the above-named provisions of dame Nature , there always will be beautiful women in the world ; yet the world will never see another Lucy Tartan . Her cheeks were tinted with the most delicate white and red , the white predominating . Her eyes some god brought down from heaven ; her hair was Danae 's , spangled with Jove 's shower ; her teeth were dived for in the Persian Sea . If long wont to fix his glance on those who , trudging through the humbler walks of life , and whom unequal toil and poverty deform ; if that man shall haply view some fair and gracious daughter of the gods , who , from unknown climes of loveliness and affluence , comes floating into sight , all symmetry and radiance ; how shall he be transported , that in a world so full of vice and misery as ours , there should yet shine forth this visible semblance of the heavens . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her own sex regard her not as such . A crowd of women eye a transcendent beauty entering a room , much as though a bird from Arabia had lighted on the window-sill . Say what you will , their jealousy  --  if any  --  is but an afterbirth to their open admiration . Do men envy the gods ? And shall women envy the goddesses ? A beautiful woman is born Queen of men and women both , as Mary Stuart was born Queen of Scots , whether men or women . All mankind are her Scots ; her leal clans are numbered by the nations . A true gentleman in Kentucky would cheerfully die for a beautiful woman in Hindostan , though he never saw her . Yea , count down his heart in death-drops for her ; and go to Pluto , that she might go to Paradise . He would  | turn Turk before he would disown an allegiance hereditary to all gentlemen , from the hour their Grand Master , Adam , first knelt to Eve . A plain-faced Queen of Spain dwells not in half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break heads , but her Highness can not crack a heart ; and the beautiful milliner might string hearts for necklaces . Undoubtedly , Beauty made the first Queen . If ever again the succession to the German Empire should be contested , and one poor lame lawyer should present the claims of the first excellingly beautiful woman he chanced to see  --  she would thereupon be unanimously elected Empress of the Holy Roman German Empire ; ? that is to say , if all the Germans were true , free-hearted and magnanimous gentlemen , at all capable of appreciating so immense an honor . It is nonsense to talk of France as the seat of all civility . Did not those French heathen have a Salique Law ? Three of the most bewitching creatures , ? immortal flowers of the line of Valois  --  were excluded from the French throne by that infamous provision . France , indeed ! whose Catholic millions still worship Mary Queen of Heaven ; and for ten generations refused cap and knee to many angel Maries , rightful Queens of France . Here is cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as men , assume and wear unchallenged the choicest titles , however without merit . The Americans , and not the French , are the-% world 's models of chivalry . Our Salique Law provides that universal homage shall be paid all beautiful women . No man 's most solid rights shall weigh against her airiest whims . If you buy the best seat in the coach , to go and consult a doctor on a matter of life and death , you shall cheerfully abdicate that best seat , and limp away on foot , if a pretty woman , traveling , shake one feather from the stage-house door . Now , since we began by talking of a certain young lady that went out riding with a certain youth ; and yet find ourselves , after leading such a merry dance , fast by a stage-house window ; ? this may seem rather irregular sort of writing . But whither indeed should Lucy Tartan conduct us , but among mighty Queens , and all other creatures of high degree ; and finally set us roaming , to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder . By immemorial usage , am I not bound to celebrate this Lucy Tartan ? Who shall stay me ? Is she not my hero 's own affianced ? What can be gainsaid ? Where underneath the tester of the night sleeps such another ? Yet , how would Lucy Tartan shrink from all this noise and clatter ! She is bragged of , but not brags . Thus far she hath floated as stilly through this life , as thistle-down floats over meadows . Noiseless , she , except with Pierre ; and even with him she lives through many a panting hush . Oh , those love-pauses that they know  --  how ominous of their future ; for pauses precede the earthquake , and every other terrible commotion ! But blue be their sky awhile , and lightsome all their chat , and frolicsome their humors . Never shall I get down the vile inventory ! How , if with paper and with pencil I went out into the starry night to inventorize the heavens ? Who shall tell stars as teaspoons ? Who shall put down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest ; her parentage , what fortune she would possess , how many dresses in her wardrobe , and how many rings upon her fingers ; cheerfully would I let the genealogists , taxgatherers , and upholsterers attend to that . My proper province is with the angelical part of Lucy . But as in some quarters , there prevails a sort of prejudice against angels , who are merely angels and nothing more ; therefore I shall martyrize myself , by letting such gentlemen and ladies into some details of Lucy Tartan 's history . She was the daughter of an early and most cherished friend of Pierre 's father . But that father was now dead , and she resided an only daughter with her mother , in a very fine house in the city . But though her home was in the city , her heart was twice a year in the country . She did not at-all love the city and its empty , heartless , ceremonial ways . It was very strange , but most eloquently significant of her own natural angelhood that , though born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pined for unbaked earth and inland grass . So the sweet linnet , though born inside of wires in a lady 's chamber on the ocean coast , and ignorant all its life of any other spot ; yet , when spring-time comes , it is seized with flutterings and vague impatiences ; it  | can not eat or drink for these wild longings . Though unlearned by any experience , still the inspired linnet divinely knows that the inland migrating time has come . And just so with Lucy in her first longings for the verdure . Every spring those wild flutterings shook her ; every spring , this sweet linnet girl did migrate inland . Oh God grant that those other and long after nameless flutterings of her inmost soul , when all life was become weary to her  --  God grant , that those deeper flutterings in her were equally significant of her final heavenly migration from this heavy earth . It was fortunate for Lucy that her Aunt Llanyllyn  --  a pensive , childless , white-turbaned widow  --  possessed and occupied a pretty cottage in the village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this excellent old aunt was very partial to her , and always felt a quiet delight in having Lucy near her . So Aunt Llanyllyn 's cottage , in effect , was Lucy 's . And now , for some years past , she had annually spent several months at Saddle Meadows ; and it was among the pure and soft incitements of the country that Pierre first had felt toward Lucy the dear passion which now made him wholly hers . Lucy had two brothers ; one her senior , by three years , and the other her junior by two . But these young men were officers in the navy ; and so they did not permanently live with Lucy and her mother . Mrs. Tartan was mistress of an ample fortune . She was , moreover , perfectly aware that such was the fact , and was somewhat inclined to force it upon the notice of other people , nowise interested in the matter . In other words , Mrs. Tartan , instead of being daughter-proud , for which she had infinite reason , was a little inclined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightest reason ; seeing that the Great Mogul probably possessed a larger fortune than she , not to speak of the Shah of Persia and Baron Rothschild , and a thousand other millionaires ; whereas , the Grand Turk , and all their other majesties of Europe , Asia , and Africa to boot , could not , in all their joint dominions , boast so sweet a girl as Lucy . Nevertheless , Mrs. Tartan was an excellent sort of lady , as this lady-like world goes . She subscribed to charities , and owned five pews in as many churches , and went  | about trying to promote the general felicity of the world , by making all the handsome young people of her acquaintance marry one another . In other words , she was a match-makernot a Lucifer match-maker  --  though , to tell the truth , she may have kindled the matrimonial blues in certain dissatisfied gentlemen 's breasts , who had been wedded under her particular auspices , and by her particular advice . Rumor said  --  but rumor is always fibbing  --  that there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the pains of privately circulating handbills among all unmarried young strangers , warning them against the insidious approaches of Mrs. Tartan ; and , for reference , named themselves in cipher . But this could not have been true ; for , flushed with a thousand matches  --  burning blue or bright , it made little matter  --  Mrs. Tartan sailed the seas of fashion , causing all topsails to lower to her ; and towing flotillas of young ladies , for all of whom she was bound to find the finest husband harbors in the world . But does not match-making , like charity , begin at home ? Why is her own daughter Lucy without a mate ? But not so fast ; Mrs. Tartan years ago laid out that sweet programme concerning k . Pierre and Lucy ; but in this case , her programme happened to coincide , in some degree , with a previous one in heaven , and only for that cause did it come to pass , that Pierre Glendinning was the proud elect of Lucy Tartan . Besides , this being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the most part , been rather circumspect and cautious in all her manoeuvrings with Pierre and Lucy . Moreover , the thing demanded no manoeuvring at all . The two Platonic particles , after roaming in quest of each other , from the time of Saturn and Ops till now ; they came together before Mrs. Tartan 's own eyes ; and what more could Mrs. Tartan do toward making them forever one and indivisible ? Once , and only once , had a dim suspicion passed through Pierre 's mind , that Mrs. Tartan was a lady thimble-rigger , and slyly rolled the pea . In their less mature acquaintance , he was breakfasting with Lucy and her mother in the city , and the first cup of coffee had been poured out by Mrs. Tartan , when she declared she smelt matches burning somewhere in the house , and she must see them  |p3I  extinguished . So banning all pursuit , she rose to seek for the burning matches , leaving the pair alone to interchange the civilities of the coffee ; and finally sent word to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something else , had given her a headache , and begged Lucy to send her up some toast and tea , for she would breakfast in her own chamber that morning . Upon this , Pierre looked from Lucy to his boots , and as he lifted his eyes again , saw Anacreon on the sofa on one side of him , and Moore 's Melodies on the other , and some honey on the table , and a bit of white satin on the floor , and a sort of bride 's veil on the chandelier . Never mind though  --  thought Pierre , fixing his gaze on Lucy ? I 'm entirely willing to be caught , when the bait is set in Paradise , and the bait is such an angel . Again he glanced at Lucy , and saw a look of infinite subdued vexation , and some unwonted pallor on her cheek . Then willingly he would have kissed the delicious bait , that so gently hated to be tasted in the trap . But glancing round again , and seeing that the music , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had been adjusting upon the piano ; seeing that this music was now in a vertical pile against the wall , with ? " Love was once a little boy , " for the outermost and only visible sheet ; and thinking this to be a remarkable coincidence under the circumstances ; Pierre could not refrain from a humorous smile , though it was a very gentle one , and immediately repented of , especially as Lucy seeing and interpreting it , immediately arose , with an unaccountable , indignant , angelical , adorable , and all-persuasive " Mr. Glendinning ? " utterly confounded in him the slightest germ of suspicion as to Lucy 's collusion in her mother 's imagined artifices . Indeed , Mrs. Tartan 's having any thing whatever to do , or hint , or finesse in this matter of the loves of Pierre and Lucy , was nothing less than immensely gratuitous and sacrilegious . Would Mrs. Tartan doctor lilies when they blow ? Would Mrs. Tartan set about match-making between the steel and magnet ? Preposterous Mrs. Tartan ! But this whole world is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; chief among whom was Mrs. Tartan , match-maker to the nation .  | This conduct of Mrs. Tartan , was the more absurd , seeing that she could not but know that Mrs. Glendinning desired the thing . And was not Lucy wealthy ? ? going to be , that is , very wealthy when her mother died ; ? ( sad thought that for Mrs. Tartan ) ? and was not her husband 's family of the best ; and had not Lucy 's father been a bosom friend of Pierre 's father ? And though Lucy might be matched to some one man , where among women was the match for Lucy ? Exceedingly preposterous Mrs. Tartan ! But when a lady like Mrs. Tartan has nothing positive and useful to do , then she will do just such preposterous things as Mrs. Tartan did . Well , time went on ; and Pierre loved Lucy , and Lucy , Pierre ; till at last the two young naval gentlemen , her brothers , happened to arrive in Mrs. Tartan 's drawing-room , from their first cruise  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather stared at Pierre , finding him on the sofa , and Lucy not very remote . " Pray , be seated , gentlemen , " said Pierre . " Plenty of room . " " My darling brothers ! " cried Lucy , embracing them . " My darling brothers and sister ! " cried Pierre , folding them together . " Pray , hold off , sir , " said the elder brother , who had served as a passed midshipman for the last two weeks . The younger brother retreated a little , and clapped his hand upon his dirk , saying , " Sir , we are from the Mediterranean . Sir , permit me to say , this is decidedly improper ! Who may you be , sir ? " " I ca n't explain for joy , " cried Pierre , hilariously embracing them all again . " Most extraordinary ! " cried the elder brother , extricating his shirt-collar from the embrace , and pulling it up vehemently . " Draw ! " cried the younger , intrepidly . " Peace , foolish fellows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playfellow , Pierre Glendinning . " " Pierre ? why , Pierre ? " cried the lads ? " a hug all round again ! You 've grown a fathom ! ? who would have known you ? But , then  --  Lucy ? I say , Lucy ? ? what business have you here in this ? eh ? eh ? ? hugging-match , I should call it ? "  | " Oh ! Lucy do n't mean any thing , " cried Pierre ? " come , one more all round . " So they all embraced again ; and that evening it was publicly known that Pierre was to wed with Lucy . Whereupon , the young officers took it upon themselves to think  --  though they by no means presumed to breathe it  --  that they had authoritatively , though indirectly , accelerated a before ambiguous and highly incommendable state of affairs between the now affianced lovers , In the fine old robust times of Pierre 's grandfather , an American gentleman of substantial person and fortune spent his time in a somewhat different style from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pierre measured six feet four inches in height ; during a fire in the old manorial mansion , with one dash of his foot , he had smitten down an oaken door , to admit the buckets of his negro slaves ; Pierre had often tried on his military vest , which still remained an heirloom at Saddle Meadows , and found the pockets below his knees , and plenty additional room for a fair-sized quarter-cask within its buttoned girth ; in a night-scuffle in the wilderness before the Revolutionary War , he had annihilated two Indian savages by making reciprocal bludgeons of their heads . And all this was done by the mildest hearted , and most blue-eyed gentleman in the world , who , according to the patriarchal fashion of those days , was a gentle , white-haired worshiper of all the household gods ; the gentlest husband , and the gentlest father ; the kindest of masters to his slaves ; of the most wonderful unruflledness of temper ; a serene smoker of his after-dinner pipe ; a forgiver of many injuries ; a sweet-hearted , charitable Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blue-eyed , divine old man ; in whose meek , majestic soul , the lion and the Iamb embraced  --  fit image of his God . Never could Pierre look upon his fine military portrait without an infinite and mournful longing to meet his living aspect in actual life . The majestic sweetness of this portrait was truly wonderful in its effects upon any sensitive and generous-minded  | young observer . For such , that portrait possessed the heavenly persuasiveness of angelic speech ; a glorious gospel framed and hung upon the wall , and declaring to all people , as from the Mount , that man is a noble , god-like being , full of choicest juices ; made up of strength and beauty . Now , this grand old Pierre Glendinning was a great lover of horses ; but not in the modern sense , for he was no jockey ; one of his most intimate friends of the masculine gender was a huge , proud , gray horse , of a surprising reserve of manner , his saddle-beast ; he had his horses ' mangers carved like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key of the corn-bin hung in his library ; and no one grained his steeds , but himself ; unless his absence from home promoted Moyar , an incorruptible and most punctual old black , to that honorable office . He said that no man loved his horses , unless his own hands grained them . Every Christmas he gave them brimming measures . " I keep Christmas with my horses , " said grand old Pierre . This grand old Pierre always rose at sunrise ; washed his face and chest in the open air ; and then , returning to his closet , and being completely arrayed at last , stepped forth to make a ceremonious call at his stables , to bid his very honorable friends there a very good and joyful morning . Woe to Cranz , Kit , Douw , or any other of his stable slaves , if grand old Pierre found one horse unblanketed , or one weed among the hay that filled their rack . Not that he ever had Cranz , Kit , Douw , or any of them flogged  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would refuse to say his wonted pleasant word to them ; and that was very bitter to them , for Cranz , Kit , Douw , and all of them , loved grand old Pierre , as his shepherds loved old Abraham . What decorous , lordly , gray-haired steed is this ? What old Chaldean rides abroad ? ? ' T is grand old Pierre ; who , every morning before he eats , goes out promenading with his saddlebeast ; nor mounts him , without first asking leave . But time glides on , and grand old Pierre grows old : his life 's glorious grape now swells with fatness ; he has not the conscience to saddle his majestic beast with such a mighty load of manliness . Besides , the noble beast himself is growing old , and has a touching look of meditativeness in his large , attentive eyes . Leg of  | man , swears grand old Pierre , shall never more bestride my steed ; no more shall harness touch him ! Then every spring he sowed a field with clover for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the choicest hay to winter him ; and had his destined grain threshed out with a flail , whose handle had once borne a flag in a brisk battle , into which this same old steed had pranced with grand old Pierre ; one waving mane , one waving sword ! Now needs must grand old Pierre take a morning drive ; he rides no more with the old gray steed . He has a phaeton built , fit for a vast General , in whose sash three common men might hide . Doubled , trebled are the huge S-shaped leather springs ; the wheels seem stolen from some mill ; the canopied seat is like a testered bed . From beneath the old archway , not one horse , but two , every morning now draw forth old Pierre , as the Chinese draw their fat god Joss , once every year from out his fane . But time glides on , and a morning comes , when the phaeton emerges not ; but all the yards and courts are full ; helmets line the ways ; sword-points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the stairs ; and mournful martial melodies are heard in all the halls . Grand old Pierre is dead ; and like a hero of old battles , he dies on the eve of another war ; ere wheeling to fire on the foe , his platoons fire over their old commander 's grave ; in A.D. 1812 , died grand old Pierre . The drum that beat in brass his funeral march , was a British kettle-drum , that had once helped beat the vain-glorious march , for the thirty thousand predestined prisoners , led into sure captivity by that bragging boy , Burgoyne . Next day the old gray steed turned from his grain ; turned round , and vainly whinnied in his stall . By gracious Moyar 's hand , he refuses to be patted now ; plain as horse can speak , the old gray steed says ? " I smell not the wonted hand ; where is grand old Pierre ? Grain me not , and groom me not ; ? where is grand old Pierre ? " He sleeps not far from his master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly lain him down ; and long ere this , grand old Pierre and steed have passed through that grass to glory . But his phaeton , like his plumed hearse , outlives the noble 36 PIERRE LOVE , DELIGHT , AND ALARM 37  | load it bore . And the dark bay steeds that drew grand old Pierre alive , and by his testament drew him dead , and , followed the lordly lead of the led gray horse ; those dark bay steeds are still extant ; not in themselves or in their issue ; but in the two descendants of stallions of their own breed . For on the lands of Saddle Meadows , man and horse are both hereditary ; and this bright morning Pierre Glendinning , grandson of grand old Pierre , now drives forth with Lucy Tartan , seated where his own ancestor had sat , and reining steeds , whose **29;530;TOOLONG grand old Pierre had reined before . How proud felt Pierre : in fancy 's eye , he saw the horse-ghosts a-tandem in the van . " These are but wheelers " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But Love has more to do with his own possible and probable posterities , than with the once living but now impossible ancestries in the past . Su Pierre 's glow of family pride quickly gave place to a deeper hue , when late ) , bade love 's banner blush out from his check . That morning was the choicest drop that Time had in his vase . Ineffable distillations of a soft delight were wafted from the fields and hills . Fatal morning that , to all lovers unbetrothed ; " Come to your confessional , " it cried . " Behold our airy loves , " the birds chirped from the trees ; far out at sea , no more the sailors tied their bowline-knots ; their hands had lost their cunning will they , till they , Love tied love-knots on every spangled spar . Oh , praised be the beauty of this earth , the beauty , and the bloom , and the mirthfulness thereof ! The first worlds made were winter worlds ; the second made , were vernal worlds ; the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world of ours . In the cold and nether spheres , preachers preach of earth , as we of Paradise above . Oh , there , my friends , they say , they have a season , in their language known as summer . Then their fields spin themselves green carpets ; snow and ice are not in all the land ; then a million strange , bright , fragrant things powder that sward with perfumes ; and high , majestic beings , dumb and  | grand , stand up with outstretched arms , and hold their green canopies over merry angels  --  men and women  --  who love and wed , and sleep and dream , beneath the approving glances of their- visible god and goddess , glad-hearted sun , and pensive moon ! Oh , praised be the beauty of this earth , the beauty , and the bloom , and the mirthfulness thereof ! We lived before , and shall live again ; and as we hope for a fairer world than this to come ; so we came from one less fine . From each successive world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is the accursed clog from chaos , and thither , by every new translation , we drive him further and further back again . Hosannahs to this world ! so beautiful itself , and the vestibule to more . Out of some past Egypt , we have come to this new Canaan ; and from this new Canaan , we press on to some Circassia . Though still the villains , Want and Woe , followed us out of Egypt , and now beg in Canaan 's streets : yet Circassia 's gates shall not admit them ; they , with their sire , the demon Principle , must back to chaos , whence they came . Love was first begot by Mirth and Peace , in Eden , when the world was young . The man oppressed with cares , he can not love ; the man of gloom finds not the god . So , as youth , for the most part , has no cares , and knows no gloom , therefore , ever since time did begin , youth belongs to love . Love may end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all other modes of human mournfulness ; but love begins in joy . Love 's first sigh is never breathed , till after Love hath laughed . Love laughs first , and then sighs after . Love has not hands , but cymbals ; Love 's mouth is chambered like a bugle , and the instinctive breathings of his life breathe jubilee notes of joy ! That morning , two bay horses drew two Laughs along the road that led to the hills from Saddle Meadows . Apt time they kept ; Pierre Glendinning 's young , manly tenor , to Lucy Tartan 's girlish treble . Wondrous fair of face , blue-eyed , and golden-haired , the bright blonde , Lucy , was arrayed in colors harmonious with the heavens . Light blue be thy perpetual color , Lucy ; light blue becomes thee best  --  such the repeated azure counsel of  | Lucy Tartan 's mother . On both sides , from the hedges , came to Pierre the clover bloom of Saddle Meadows , and from Lucy 's mouth and cheek came the fresh fragrance of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or thee ? " cried Pierre . " See I lakes , or eyes ? " cried Lucy , her own gazing down into his soul , as two stars gaze down into a tarn . No Cornwall miner ever sunk so deep a shaft beneath the sea , as Love will sink beneath the floatings of the eyes . Love sees ten million fathoms down , till dazzled by the floor of pearls . The eye is Love 's own magic glass , where all things that are not of earth , glide in supernatural light . There are not so many fishes in the sea , as there are sweet images in lovers ' eyes . In those miraculous translucencies swim the strange eye-fish with wings , that sometimes leap out , instinct with joy ; moist fish-wings wet the lover 's cheek . Love 's eyes are holy things ; therein the mysteries of life are lodged ; looking in each other 's eyes , lovers see the ultimate secret of the worlds ; and with thrills eternally untranslatable , feel that Love is god of all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked deep down into their own lover 's eyes , they know not the sweetest and the loftiest religion of this earth . Love is both Creator 's and Saviour 's gospel to mankind ; a volume bound in rose-leaves , clasped with violets , and by the beaks of humming-birds printed with peach-juice on the leaves of lilies . Endless is the account of Love . Time and space can not contain Love 's story . All things that are sweet to see , or taste , or feel , or hear , all these things were made by Love ; and none other things were made by Love . Love made not the Arctic zones , but Love is ever reclaiming them . Say , are not the fierce things of this earth daily , hourly going out ? Where now are your wolves of Britain ? Where in Virginia now , find you the panther and the pard ? Oh , Love is busy everywhere . Everywhere Love hath Moravian missionaries . No Propagandist like to Love . The south wind woos the barbarous north ; on many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east . All this Earth is Love 's affianced ; vainly the demon Principle howls to stay the banns . Why round her middle wears this  | world so rich a zone of torrid verdure , if she be not dressing for the final rites ? And why provides she orange blossoms and lilies of the valley , if she would not that all men and maids should love and marry ? For every wedding where true lovers wed , helps on the march of universal Love . Who are brides here shall be Love 's bridesmaids in the marriage world to come . So on all sides Love allures ; can contain himself what youth who views the wonders of the beauteous woman-world ? Where a beautiful woman is , there is all Asia and her Bazars . Italy hath not a sight before the beauty of a Yankee girl ; nor heaven a blessing beyond her earthly love . Did not the angelical Lotharios come down to earth , that they might taste of mortal woman 's Love and Beauty ? even while her own silly brothers were pining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envying angels did come down ; did emigrate ; and who emigrates except to be better off ? Love is this world 's great redeemer and reformer ; and as all beautiful women are her selectest emissaries , so bath Love gifted them with a magnetical persuasiveness , that no youth can possibly repel . The own heart 's choice of every youth seems ever as an inscrutable witch to him ; and by ten thousand concentric spells and circling incantations , glides round and round him , as he turns : murmuring meanings of unearthly import ; and summoning up to him all the subterranean sprites and gnomes ; and unpeopling all the sea for naiads to swim round him ; so that mysteries are evoked as in exhalations by this Love ; ? what wonder then that Love was aye a mystic ? V. And this self-same morning Pierre was very mystical ; not continually , though ; but most mystical one moment , and overflowing with mad , unbridled merriment , the next . He seemed a youthful Magian , and almost a mountebank together . Chaldaic improvisations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heel of humorous retort and repartee . More especially , the bright glance of Lucy was transporting to him . Now , reckless of his horses , with both arms holding Lucy in his embrace , like a Sicilian diver he dives deep down in the Adriatic of her eyes , and  | brings up some king's-cup of joy . All the waves in Lucy 's eyes seemed waves of infinite glee to him . And as if , like veritable seas , they did indeed catch the reflected irradiations of that pellucid azure morning ; in Lucy 's eyes , there seemed to shine all the blue glory of the general day , and all the sweet inscrutableness of the sky . And certainly , the blue eye of woman , like the sea , is not uninfluenced by the atmosphere . Only in the open air of some divinest , summer day , will you see its ultramarine , ? its fluid lapis lazuli . Then would Pierre burst forth in some screaming shout of joy ; and the striped tigers of his chestnut eyes leaped in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in extreme love ; for the extremest top of love , is Fear and Wonder . Soon the swift horses drew this fair god and goddess nigh the wooded hills , whose distant blue , now changed into a variously-shaded green , stood before them like old Babylonian walls , overgrown with verdure ; while here and there , at regular intervals , the scattered peaks seemed mural towers ; and the clumped pines surmounting them , as lofty archers , and vast , out-looking watchers of the glorious Babylonian City of the Day . Catching that hilly air , the prancing horses neighed ; laughed on the ground with gleeful feet . Felt they the gay delightsome spurrings of the day ; for the day was mad with excessive joy ; and high in heaven you heard the neighing of the horses of the sun ; and down dropped their nostrils ' froth in many a fleecy vapor from the hills . From the plains , the mists rose slowly ; reluctant yet to quit so fair a mead . At those green slopings , Pierre reined in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank , gazing far , and far away ; over many a grove and lake ; corn-crested uplands , and herd's-grass lowlands ; and long-stretching swales of vividest green , betokening where the greenest bounty of this earth seeks its winding channels ; as ever , the most heavenly bounteousness most seeks the lowly places ; making green and glad many a humble mortal 's breast , and leaving to his own lonely aridness , many a hill-top prince 's state . But Grief , not Joy , is a moralizer ; and small moralizing wisdom caught Pierre from that scene . With Lucy 's hand in his ,  | and feeling , softly feeling of its soft tinglingness ; he seemed as one placed in linked correspondence with the summer lightnings ; and by sweet shock on shock , receiving intimating foretastes of the etherealest delights of earth . Now , prone on the grass he falls , with his attentive upward glance fixed on Lucy 's eyes . " Thou art my heaven , Lucy ; and here I lie thy shepherd-king , watching for new eye-stars to rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ; lo ! a new planet there ; ? and behind all , an infinite starry nebulousness , as if thy being were backgrounded by some spangled veil of mystery . " Is Lucy deaf to all these ravings of his lyric love ? Why looks she down , and vibrates so ; and why now from her over-charged lids , drops such warm drops as these ? No joy now in Lucy 's eyes , and seeming tremor on her lips . " Ah ! thou too ardent and impetuous Pierre ! " " Nay , thou too moist and changeful April ! know'st thou not , that the moist and changeful April is followed by the glad , assured , and showerless joy of June ? And this , Lucy , this day should be thy June , even as it is the earth 's ! " " Ah , Pierre ! not June to me . But say , are not the sweets of June made sweet by the April tears ? " " Ay , love ! but here fall more drops , ? more and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April , and pertain not to the June . " " June ! June ! ? thou bride 's month of the summer , following the spring 's sweet courtship of the earth , ? my June , my June is yet to come ! " " Oh ! yet to come , but fixedly decreed ; ? good as come , and better . " " Then no flower that , in the bud , the April showers have nurtured ; no such flower may untimely perish , ere the June unfolds it ? Ye will not swear that , Pierre ? " " The audacious immortalities of divinest love are in me ; and I now swear to thee all the immutable eternities of joyfulness , that ever woman dreamed of , in this dream-house of the earth . A god decrees to thee unchangeable felicity ; and to me , the un-  | challenged possession of thee and them , for my inalienable fief . ? Do I rave ? Look on me , Lucy ; think on me , girl . " " Thou art young , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invests thee , Pierre ; and thy intrepid heart never yet felt the touch of fear ; but " But what ? " " Ah , my best Pierre ! " " With kisses I will suck thy secret from thy cheek ! ? but what ? " " Let us hie homeward , Pierre . Some nameless sadness , faintness , strangely comes to mc . Foretaste I feel of endless dreariness . Tell me once more the story of that face , Pierre , ? that mysterious , haunting face , which thou once told'st me , thou ' didst thrice vainly try to shun . Blue is the sky , oh , bland the air , Pierre ; ? but  --  tell Inc the story of the face , ? the dark-eyed , lustrous , imploring , mournful face , that so mystically paled , and shrunk at thine . Ali , Pierre , sometimes I have thought , ? never will I wed with mny best Pierre , until the riddle of that face be known . Tell me , tell me , Pierre ; ? as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mournfulness , that face this instant fastens me . " " Bewitched ! bewitched ! ? Cursed be the hour I acted on the thought , that Love bath no reserves . Never should I have told thee the story of that face , Lucy . I have bared myself too much to thee . Oh , never should Love know all ! " " Knows not all , then loves not all , Pierre . Never shalt thou so say again ; ? and Pierre , listen to me . Now , ? now , in this inexplicable trepidation that I feel , I do conjure thee , that thou wilt ever continue to do as thou hast done ; so that I may ever continue to know all that agitatest thee , the airiest and most transient thought , that ever shall sweep into thee from the wide atmosphere of all things that hem mortality . Did I doubt thee here ; ? could I ever think , that thy heart bath yet one private nook or corner from me ; ? fatal disenchanting day for me , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pierre  --  and ' t is Love 's own self that now speaks through me  --  only in unbounded confidence and interchangings of all subtlest secrets , can Love possibly endure .  | Love 's self is a secret , and so feeds on secrets , Pierre . Did I only know of thee , what the whole common world may know ? what then were Pierre to me ? ? Thou must be wholly a disclosed secret to me ; Love is vain and proud ; and when I walk the streets , and meet thy friends , I must still be laughing and hugging to myself the thought , ? They know him not ; ? I only know my Pierre ; ? none else beneath the circuit of yon sun . Then , swear to me , dear Pierre , that thou wilt never keep a secret from me  --  no , never , never ; ? swear ! " " Something seizes me . Thy inexplicable tears , falling , falling on my heart , have now turned it to a stone . I feel icy cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pierre ! Pierre ! " " God help thee , and God help me , Lucy . I can not think , that in this most mild and dulcet air , the invisible agencies are plotting treasons against our loves . Oh ! if ye be now nigh us , ye things I have no name for ; then by a name that should be efficacious  --  by Christ 's holy name , I warn ye back from her and me . Touch her not , ye airy devils ; hence to your appointed hell ! why come ye prowling in these heavenly purlieus ? Can not the chains of Love omnipotent bind ye , fiends ? " " Is this Pierre ? His eyes glare fearfully ; now I see layer on layer deeper in him ; he turns round and menaces the air and talks to it , as if defied by the air . Woe is me , that fairy love should raise this evil spell ! ? Pierre ? " " But now I was infinite distances from thee , oh my Lucy , wandering baffled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though I have wandered to the Boreal realm , Lucy . Here I sit down by thee ; I catch a soothing from thee . " " My own , own Pierre ! Pierre , into ten trillion pieces I could now be torn for thee ; in my bosom would yet hide thee , and there keep thee warm , though I sat down on Arctic ice-floes , frozen to a corpse . My own , best , blessed Pierre ! Now , could I plant some poniard in me , that my silly ailings should have power to move thee thus , and pain thee thus . Forgive me , Pierre ; thy changed face hath chased the other from me ; the fright of thee exceeds all other frights . It does not so haunt me now . Press hard my hand ; look hard on me , my love , that its  | last trace may pass away . Now I feel almost whole again ; now , ' t is gone . Up , my Pierre ; let us up , and fly these hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meets us . Fly we to the plain . See , thy steeds neigh for thee  --  they call thee  --  see , the clouds fly down toward the plain  --  lo , these hills now seem all desolate to me , and the vale all verdure . Thank thee , Pierre. ? See , now , I quit the hills , dry-checked ; and leave all tears behind to be sucked in by these evergreens , meet emblems of the unchanging love , my own sadness nourishes in me . Hard fate , that Love 's best verdure should feed so on tears ! " Now they rolled swiftly down the slopes ; nor tempted the upper hills ; but sped fast for the plain . Now the cloud hath passed from Lucy 's eye ; no more the lurid slanting light forks upward from her lover 's brow . In the plain they find peace , and love , and joy again . " It was the merest , idling , wanton vapor , Lucy ! " " An empty echo , Pierre , of a sad sound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The great Cod wrap thee ever , Lucy . So , now , we are home . " After seeing Lucy into her aunt 's most cheerful parlor , and seating her by the honey-suckle that half clambered into the window there ; and near to which was her easel for crayonsketching , upon part of whose frame Lucy had cunningly trained two slender vines , into whose earth-filled pots two of the three legs of the easel were inserted ; and sitting down himself by her , and by his pleasant , lightsome chat , striving to chase the last trace of sadness from her ; and not till his object seemed fully gained ; Pierre rose to call her good aunt to her , and so take his leave till evening , when Lucy called him back , begging him first to bring her the blue portfolio from her chamber , for she wished to kill her last lingering melancholy  --  if any indeed did linger now  --  by diverting her thoughts , in a little pencil sketch , to scenes widely different from those of Saddle Meadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paused on the threshold of the open door . He never had entered that chamber but with feel-  | ings of a wonderful reverentialness . The carpet seemed as holy ground . Every chair seemed sanctified by some departed saint , there once seated long ago . Here his book of Love was all a rubric , and said  --  Bow now , Pierre , bow . But this extreme loyalty to the piety of love , called from him by such glimpses of its most secret inner shrine , was not unrelieved betimes by such quickenings of all his pulses , that in fantasy he pressed the wide beauty of the world in his embracing arms ; for all his world resolved itself into his heart 's best love for Lucy . Now , crossing the magic silence of the empty chamber , he caught the snow-white bed reflected in the toilet-glass . This rooted him . For one swift instant , he seemed to see in that one glance the two separate beds  --  the real one and the reflected one  --  and an unbidden , most miserable presentiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came and went . So he advanced , and with a fond and gentle joyfulness , his eye now fell upon the spotless bed itself , and fastened on a snow-white roll that lay beside the pillow . Now he started ; Lucy seemed coming in upon him ; but no ? ' t is only the foot of one of her little slippers , just peeping into view from under the narrow nether curtains of the bed . Then again his glance fixed itself upon the slender , snow-white , ruffled roll ; and he stood as one enchanted . Never precious parchment of the Greek was half so precious in his eyes . Never trembling scholar longed more to unroll the mystic vellum , than Pierre longed to unroll the sacred secrets of that snow-white , ruffled thing . But his hands touched not any object in that chamber , except the one he had gone thither for . " Here is the blue portfolio , Lucy . See , the key hangs to its silver lock ; ? were you not fearful I would open it ? ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Open it ! " said Lucy ? " why , yes , Pierre , yes ; what secret thing keep I from thee ? Read me through and through . I am entirely thine . See ! " and tossing open the portfolio , all manner of rosy things came floating from it , and a most delicate perfume of some invisible essence . " Ah ! thou holy angel , Lucy ! "  | " Why , Pierre , thou art transfigured ; thou now lookest as one who  --  why , Pierre ? " " As one who had just peeped in at paradise , Lucy ; and " " Again wandering in thy mind , Pierre ; no more. ? Come , you must leave me , now . I am quite rested again . Quick , call my aunt , and leave me . Stay , this evening we are to look over the book of plates from the city , you know . Be early ; ? go now , Pierre . " " Well , good-bye , till evening , thou height of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beneath the vertical shadows of the noon-day trees , the sweet chamber scene abandoned him , and the mystical face recurred to him , and kept with him . At last , arrived at home , he found his mother absent ; so passing straight through the wide middle hall of the mansion , he descended the piazza on the other side , and wandered away in reveries down to the river hank . Here one primeval pine-tree had been luckily left standing by the otherwise unsparing woodmen , who long ago had cleared that meadow . It was once crossing to this noble pine , from a clump of hemlocks far across the river , that Pierre had first noticed the significant fact , that while the hemlock and the pine are trees of equal growth and stature , and are so similar in their general aspect , that people unused to woods sometimes confound them ; and while both trees are proverbially trees of sadness , yet the dark hemlock hath no music in its thoughtful boughs ; but the gentle pine-tree drops melodious mournfulness . At its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked the mighty bulk and far out-reaching length of one particular root , which , straying down the bank , the storms and rains had years ago exposed . " How wide , how strong these roots must spread ! Sure , this pine-tree takes powerful hold of this fair earth ! Yon bright flower hath not so deep a root . This tree hath outlived a century of that gay flower 's generations , and will outlive a century of them yet to come . This is most sad . Hark , now I hear the pyra-  | midical and numberless , flame-like complainings of this Eolean line ; ? the wind breathes now upon it : ? the wind , ? that is God 's breath ! Is He so sad ? Oh , tree ! so mighty thou , so lofty , yet so mournful ! This is most strange ! Hark ! as I look up into thy high secrecies , oh , tree , the face , the face , peeps down on me ! ? ' Art thou Pierre ? Come to me ' ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pendant thou , to that other countenance of sweet Lucy , which also hangs , and first did hang within my heart ! Is grief a pendant then to pleasantness ? Is grief a self-willed guest that will come in ? Yet I have never known thee , Grief ; ? thou art a legend to me . I have known some fiery broils of glorious frenzy ; I have oft tasted of revery ; whence comes pensiveness ; whence comes sadness ; whence all delicious poetic presentiments ; ? but thou , Grief ! art still a ghost-story to me . I know thee not , ? do half disbelieve in thee . Not that I would be without my too little cherished fits of sadness now and then ; but God keep me from thee , thou other shape of far profounder gloom ! I shudder at thee ! The face ! ? the face ! ? forth again from thy high secrecies , oh tree ! the face steals down upon me . Mysterious girl ! who art thou ? by what right snatchest thou thus my deepest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am affianced , and not to thee . Leave me ! ? what share hast thou in me ? Surely , thou lovest not me ? ? that were most miserable for thee , and me , and Lucy . It can not be . What , who art thou ? Oh ! wretched vagueness  --  too familiar to me , yet inexplicable , ? unknown , utterly unknown ! I seem to founder in this perplexity . Thou seemest to know somewhat of me , that I know not of myself , ? what is it then ? If thou hast a secret in thy eyes of mournful mystery , out with it ; Pierre demands it ; what is that thou hast veiled in thee so imperfectly , that I seem to see its motion , but not its form ? It visibly rustles behind the concealing screen . Now , never into the soul of Pierre , stole there before , a muffledness like this ! If aught really lurks in it , ye sovereign powers that claim all my leal worshipings , I conjure ye to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . Tread I on a mine , warn me ; advance I on a precipice , hold me back ; but abandon me to an unknown misery , that it shall suddenly seize me , and possess me , wholly , that ye will never do ; else , Pierre 's fond faith in  | ye  --  now clean , untouched  --  may clean depart ; and give me up to be a railing atheist . Ah , now the face departs . Pray heaven it hath not only stolen back , and hidden again in thy high secrecies , oh , tree ! But ' t is gone  --  gone  --  entirely gone ; and I thank God , and I feel joy again ; joy , which I also feel to be my right as man ; deprived of joy , I feel I should find cause for deadly feuds with things invisible . Ha ! a coat of iron-mail seems to grow round , and husk me now ; and I have heard , that the bitterest winters are foretold by a thicker husk upon the Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t is a dark similitude . Quit thy analogies ; sweet in the orator 's mouth , bitter in the thinker 's belly . Now , then , I 'll up with my own joyful will ; and with my joy 's face scare away all phantoms : ? so , they go ; and Pierre is Joy 's , and Life 's again . Thou pine-tree ! ? henceforth I will resist thy too treacherous persuasiveness . Thou'lt not so often woo me to thy airy tent , to ponder on the gloomy rooted stakes that bind it . Hence now I go ; and peace be with thee , pine ! That blessed sereneness which lurks ever at the heart of sadness ? mere sadness  --  and remains when all the rest has gone ; ? that sweet feeling is now mine , and cheaply mine . I am not sorry I was sad , I feel so blessed now . Dearest Lucy ! ? well , well ; ?

Methinks now the face  --  the face  --  minds me a little of pensive , sweet Francesca 's face  --  or , rather , as it had been Francesca 's daughter 's face  --  wafted on the sad dark wind , toward observant Virgil and the blistered Florentine . No , we will not open Flaxman 's Dante . Francesca 's mournful face is now ideal to me . Flaxman might evoke it wholly , ? make it present in lines of misery  --  bewitching power . No ! I will not open Flaxman 's Dante ! Damned be the hour I read in Dante ! more damned than that wherein Paolo and Francesca read in fatal Launcelot !

Encircled by bandelets of light , it had still beamed upon him ; vaguely historic and prophetic ; backward , hinting of some irrevocable sin ; forward , pointing to some inevitable ill . One of those faces , which now and then appear to man , and without one word of speech , still reveal glimpses of some fearful gospel . In natural guise , but lit by supernatural light ; palpable to the senses , but inscrutable to the soul ; in their perfectest impression on us , ever hovering between Tartarean misery and Paradisaic beauty ; such faces , compounded so of hell and heaven , overthrow in us all foregone persuasions , and make us wondering children in this world again . The face had accosted Pierre some weeks previous to his ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before her arrival for the summer at the village ; moreover it had accosted him in a very common and homely scene ; but this enhanced the wonder . 49 50 PIERRE PRESENTIMENT AND VERIFICATION 51  | On some distant business , with a farmer-tenant , he had been absent from the mansion during the best part of the day , and had but just come home , early of a pleasant moonlight evening , when Dates delivered a message to him from his mother , begging him to come for her about half-past seven that night to Mrs. Llanyllyn 's cottage , in order to accompany her thence to that of the two Miss Pennies . At the mention of that last name , Pierre well knew what he must anticipate . Those elderly and truly pious spinsters , gifted with the most benevolent hearts in the world , and at mid-age deprived by envious nature of their hearing , seemed to have made it a maxim of their charitable lives , that since God had not given them any more the power to hear Christ 's gospel preached , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Wherefore , as a matter of no possible interest to them now , they abstained from church ; and while with prayer-hooks in their hands the Rev. Mr. Falsgrave 's congregation were engaged in worshiping their God , according to the divine behest ; the two Miss Pennies , with thread and needle , were hard at work in serving him ; making up shirts and gowns for the poor people of the parish . Pierre had heard that they had recently brill at the trouble of organizing a regular society , among the neighboring farmers ' wives and daughters , to meet twice a month at their own house ( the Miss Pennies ' ) for the purpose of sewing in concert for the benefit of various settlements of necessitous emigrants , who had lately pitched their populous shanties further up the river . But though this enterprise had not been started without previously acquainting Mrs. Glendinning of it , ? for indeed she was much loved and honored by the pious spinsters , ? and their promise of solid assistance from that gracious manorial lady ; yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invited to preside , or be at all present at the semi-monthly meetings ; though he supposed , that far from having any scruples against so doing , she would be very glad to associate that way , with the good people of the village . " Now , brother Pierre " ? said Mrs. Glendinning , rising from Mrs. Llanyllyn 's huge cushioned chair ? " throw my shawl  | around me ; and good evening to Lucy 's aunt. ? There , we shall be late . " As they walked along , she added ? " Now , Pierre , I know you are apt to be a little impatient sometimes , of these sewing scenes ; but courage ; I merely want to peep in on them ; so as to get some inkling of what they would indeed be at ; and then my promised benefactions can be better selected by me . Besides , Pierre , I could have had Dates escort me , but I preferred you ; because I want you to know who they are you live among ; how many really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day be lord of the manor of . I anticipate a rare display of rural red and white . " Cheered by such pleasant promises , Pierre soon found himself leading his mother into a room full of faces . The instant they appeared , a gratuitous old body , seated with her knitting near the door , squeaked out shrilly ? " Ah ! dames , dames , ? Madam Glendinning ! ? Master Pierre Glendinning ! " Almost immediately following this sound , there came a sudden , long-drawn , unearthly , girlish shriek , from the further corner of the long , double room . Never had human voice so affected Pierre before . Though he saw not the person from whom it came , and though the voice was wholly strange to him , yet the sudden shriek seemed to split its way clean through his heart , and leave a yawning gap there . For an instant , he stood bewildered ; but started at his mother 's voice ; her arm being still in his . " Why do you clutch my arm so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fainted , ? nothing more . " Instantly Pierre recovered himself , and affecting to mock at his own trepidation , hurried across the room to offer his services , if such were needed . But dames and maidens had been all beforehand with him ; the lights were wildly flickering in the aircurrent made by the flinging open of the casement , near to where the shriek had come . But the climax of the tumult was soon past ; and presently , upon closing the casement , it subsided almost wholly . The elder of the spinster Pennies , advancing to Mrs. Glendinning , now gave her to understand , that one of the further crowd of industrious girls present , had been attacked by a sudden , but fleeting fit , vaguely imputable to some  | constitutional disorder or other . She was now quite well again . And so the company , one and all , seemingly acting upon their natural good-breeding , which in any one at bottom , is but delicacy and charity , refrained from all further curiosity ; reminded not the girl of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all needles stitched away as before . Leaving his mother to speak with whom she pleased , and attend alone to her own affairs with the society ; Pierre , oblivious now in such a lively crowd , of any past unpleasantness , after some courtly words to the Miss Pennies , ? insinuated into their understandings through a long coiled trumpet , which , when not in use , the spinsters wore , hanging like a powder-horn from their girdles : ? and likewise , after manifesting the profoundest and most intelligent interest in the mystic mechanism of a huge woolen sock , in course of completion by a spectacled old lady of his more particular acxluaintance ; after all this had been gone through , and something more too tedious to detail , but which occupied him for nearly half an hour , Pierre , with a slightly blushing , and imperfectly balanced assurance , advanced toward the further crowd of maidens ; where , by the light of many a well-snuffed candle , they clubbed all their bright contrasting cheeks , like a dense bed of garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marthas , Susans , Betties , Jennies , Nellies ; and forty more fair nymphs , who skimmed the cream , and made the butter of the fat farms of Saddle Meadows . Assurance is in presence of the assured . Where embarrassments prevail , they affect the most disembarrassed . What wonder , then , that gazing on such a thick array of wreathing , roguish , half-averted , blushing faces  --  still audacious in their very embarrassment  --  Pierre , too , should flush a bit , and stammer in his attitudes a little ? Youthful love and graciousness were in his heart ; kindest words upon his tongue ; but there he stood , target for the transfixing glances of those ambushed archers of the eye . But his abashments last too long ; his cheek hath changed from blush to pallor ; what strange thing does Pierre Glendenning see ? Behind the first close , busy breastwork of young girls , are several very little stands , or circular tables , where sit small  | groups of twos and threes , sewing in small comparative solitudes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less notable of the rural company ; or else , for some cause , they have voluntarily retired into their humble banishment . Upon one of these persons engaged at the furthermost and least conspicuous of these little stands , and close by a casement , Pierre 's glance is palely fixed . The girl sits steadily sewing ; neither she nor her two companions speak . Her eyes are mostly upon her work ; but now and then a very close observer would notice that she furtively lifts them , and moves them sideways and timidly toward Pierre ; and then , still more furtively and timidly toward his lady mother , further off . All the while , her preternatural calmness sometimes seems only made to cover the intensest struggle in her bosom . Her unadorned and modest dress is black ; fitting close up to her neck , and clasping it with a plain , velvet border . To a nice perception , that velvet shows elastically ; contracting and expanding , as though some choked , violent thing were risen up there within from the teeming region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is without a blush , or sign of any disquietude . So far as this girl lies upon the common surface , ineffable composure steeps her . But still , she sideways steals the furtive , timid glance . Anon , as yielding to the irresistible climax of her concealed emotion , whatever that may be , she lifts her whole marvelous countenance into the radiant candlelight , and for one swift instant , that face of supernaturalness unreservedly meets Pierre 's . Now , wonderful loveliness , and a still more wonderful loneliness , have with inexplicable implorings , looked up to him from that henceforth immemorial face . There , too , he seemed to see the fair ground where Anguish had contended with Beauty , and neither being conqueror , both had lain down on the field . Recovering at length from his all too obvious emotion , Pierre turned away still farther , to regain the consciods possession of himself . A wild , bewildering , and incomprehensible curiosity had seized him , to know something definite of that face . To this curiosity , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to combat it , or reason with it in the slightest way . So soon as he felt his outward composure returned to him ,  | he purposed to chat his way behind the breastwork of bright eyes and cheeks , and on some parlor pretense or other , hear , if possible , an audible syllable from one whose mere silent aspect had so potentially moved him . But at length , as with this object in mind , he was crossing the room again , he heard his mother 's voice , gayly calling him away ; and turning , saw her shawled and bonneted . He could now make no plausible stay , and smothering the agitation in him , he bowed a general and hurried adieu to the company , and went forth with his mother . They had gone some way homeward , in perfect silence , when his mother spoke . " Well , Pierre , what can it possibly be ? " " My God , mother , did you see her then ? " " My son ! " cried Mrs. Glendinniug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Pierre , " what  --  what under heaven ails you ? This is most strange ! I but playfully asked , what you were so steadfastly thinking of ; and here you answer me by the strangest question , in a voice that seems to come from under your great-grandfather 's tomb ! What , . in heaven 's name , does this mean , Pierre ? Why were you so silent , and why now are you so ill-timed in speaking ? Answer me ; ? explain all this ; ? she  --  she  --  what she should you be thinking of but Lucy Tartan ? ? Pierre , beware , beware ! I had thought you firmer in your lady 's faith , than such strange behavior as this would seem to hint . Answer me , Pierre , what may this mean ? Come , I hate a mystery ; speak , my son . " Fortunately , this prolonged verbalized wonder in his mother afforded Pierre time to rally from his double and aggravated astonishment , brought about by first suspecting that his mother also had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then , having that suspicion so violently beaten back upon him , by her apparently unaffected alarm at finding him in some region of thought wholly unshared by herself at the time . " It is nothing  --  nothing , sister Mary ; just nothing at all in the world . I believe I was dreaming  --  sleep-walking , or something of that sort . They were vastly pretty girls there this evening , sister Mary , were they not ? Come , let us walk on  --  do , sister mine . " " Pierre , Pierre ! ? but I will take your arm again ; ? and have  | you really nothing more to say ? were you really wandering , Pierre ? " " I swear to you , my dearest mother , that never before in my whole existence , have I so completely gone wandering in my soul , as at that very moment . But it is all over now . " Then in a less earnest and somewhat playful tone , he added : " And sister mine , if you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be aware , that the only treatment for such a case of harmless temporary aberration , is for all persons to ignore it in the subject . So no more of this foolishness . Talking about it only makes me feel very unpleasantly silly , and there is no knowing that it may not bring it back upon me . " " Then by all means , my dear boy , not another word about it . But it 's passing strange  --  very , very strange indeed . Well , about that morning business ; how fared you ? Tell me about it . " So Pierre , gladly plunging into this welcome current of talk , was enabled to attend his mother home without furnishing further cause for her concern or wonderment . But not by any means so readily could he allay his own concern and wonderment . Too really true in itself , however evasive in its effect at the time , was that earnest answer to his mother , declaring that never in his whole existence had he been so profoundly stirred . The face haunted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal Madonna 's haunts the morbidly longing and enthusiastic , but ever-baffled artist . And ever , as the mystic face thus rose before his fancy 's sight , another sense was touched in him ; the long-drawn , unearthly , girlish shriek pealed through and through his soul ; for now he knew the shriek came from the face  --  such Delphic shriek could only come from such a source . And wherefore that shriek ? thought Pierre . Bodes it ill to the face , or me , or both ? How am I changed , that my appearance on any scene should have power to work such woe ? But it was mostly the face  --  the face , that wrought upon him . The shriek seemed as incidentally embodied there . The emotions he experienced seemed to have taken hold of  | the deepest roots and subtlest fibers of his being . And so much the more that it was so subterranean in him , so much the more did he feel its weird inscrutableness . What was one unknown , sad-eyed , shrieking girl to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this was only one of them . And what was the most beautiful sad-eyed girl to him ? Sadness might be beautiful , as well as mirth  --  he lost himself trying to follow out this tangle . " I will no more of this infatuation , " he would cry ; but forth from regions of irradiated air , the divine beauty and imploring sufferings of the face , stole into his view . Hitherto I have ever held but lightly , thought Pierre , all stories of ghostly mysticalness in man ; my creed of this world leads me to believe in visible , beautiful flesh , and audible breath , however sweet and scented ; but only in visible flesh , and audible breath , have I hitherto believed . But now ! ? now ! ? and again he would lose himself in the most surprising and preternatural ponderings , which baffled all the introspective cunning of his mind . Himself was too much for himself . He felt that what he had always before considered the solid land of veritable reality , was now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , disembarking in his soul , as from flotillas of specter-boats . The terrors of the face were not those of Gorgon ; not by repelling hideousness did it smite him so ; but bewilderingly allured him , by its nameless beauty , and its long-suffering , hopeless anguish . But he was sensible that this general effect upon him , was also special ; the face somehow mystically appealing to his own private and individual affections ; and by a silent and tyrannic call , challenging him in his deepest moral being , and summoning Truth , Love , Pity , Conscience , to the stand . Apex of all wonders ! thought Pierre ; this indeed almost unmans me with its wonderfulness . Escape the face he could not . Muffling his own in his bed-clothes  --  that did not hide it . Flying from it by sunlight down the meadows , was as vain . Most miraculous of all to Pierre was the vague impression , that somewhere he had seen traits of the likeness of that face before . But where , he could not say ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , imagine . He was not unaware  --  for in one or two instances , he had experienced the fact  --  that sometimes a man may see a passing countenance in the street , which shall irresistibly and magnetically affect him , for a moment , as wholly unkliown to him , and yet strangely reminiscent of some vague face has previously encountered , in some fancied time , too , of extreme interest to his life . But not so was it now with Pierre . The face had not perplexed him for a few speculative minutes , and then glided from him , to return no more . It stayed close by him ; only  --  and not invariably  --  could he repel it , by the exertion of all his resolution and self-will . Besides , what of general enchantment lurked in his strange sensations , seemed concent i ingly condensed , and pointed to a spear-head , that pierced his heart with an inexplicable pang , whenever the specializing emotion  --  to call it so  --  seized the possession of his thoughts , and waved into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many an old legendary family scene , which he had heard related by his elderly relations , some of them now dead . Disguising his wild reveries as best he might from the notice of his mother , and all other persons of her household , for two days Pierre wrestled with his own haunted spirit ; and at last , so effectually purged it of all weirdnesses , and so effectually regained the general mastery of himself , that for a time , life went with him , as though he had never been stirred so strangely . Once more , the sweet unconditional thought of Lucy slid wholly into his soul , dislodging thence all such phantom occupants . Once more he rode , he walked , he swam , he vaulted ; and with new zest threw himself into the glowing practice of all those manly exercises , he so dearly loved . It almost seemed in him , that ere promising forever to protect , as well as eternally to love , his Lucy , he must first completely invigorate and embrawn himself into the possession of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucy against the whole physical world . Still  --  even before the occasional reappearance of the face to him  --  Pierre , for all his willful ardor in his gymnasticals and other diversions , whether in-doors or out , or whether by book or foil ; still , Pierre could not but be secretly annoyed , and not  | a little perplexed , as to the motive , which , for the first time in his recollection , had impelled him , not merely to conceal from his mother a singular circumstance in his life ( for that , he felt would have been but venial ; and besides , as will eventually be seen , he could find one particular precedent for it , in his past experience ) but likewise , and superaddedly , to parry , nay , to evade , and , in effect , to return something alarmingly like a fib , to an explicit question put to him by his mother ; ? such being the guise , in which part of the conversation they had had that eventful night , now appeared to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer had not pantheistically burst from him in a momentary interregnum of self-command . No ; his mother had made quite a lengthy speech to him ; during which he well remembered , he had been carefully , though with trepidation , turning over in his mind , how best he might recall her from her unwished-for and untimely scent . Why had this been so ? Was this his wont ? What inscrutable thing was it , that so suddenly had seized him , and made him a falsifyer  --  ay , a falsifyer and nothing less  --  to his own dearly-beloved , and confiding Iuother ? here , indeed , was something strange for him ; here was stuff for his utmost ethical meditations . But , nevertheless , on strict introspection , he felt , that he would not willingly have it otherwise ; not willingly would he now undissemble himself in this matter to his mother . Why was this , too ? Was this his wont ? Here , again , was food for mysticism . Here , in imperfect inklings , tinglings , presentiments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are Magians , sooner or later know , and more or less assuredly  --  that not always in our actions , are we our own factors . But this conceit was very dim in Pierre ; and dimness is ever suspicious and repugnant to us ; and so , Pierre shrank abhorringly from the infernal catacombs of thought , down into which this feetal fancy beckoned him . Only this , though in secret , did he cherish ; only this , he felt persuaded of ; namely , that not for both worlds would he have his mother made a partner to his sometime mystic mood . But with this nameless fascination of the face upon him , during those two days that it had first and fully possessed him for its own , did perplexed Pierre refrain from that apparently most  | natural of all resources , ? boldly seeking out , and returning to the palpable cause , and questioning her , by look or voice , or loath together  --  the mysterious girl herself ? No ; not entirely did Pierre here refrain . But his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may seem  --  did not so much appear to be embodied in the ' mournful person of the olive girl , as by some radiations from her , embodied in the vague conceits which agitated his own soul . There , lurked the subtler secret : that , Pierre had striven to tear away . From without , no wonderful ( ' Ifect is wrought within ourselves , unless some interior , responding wonder meets it . That the starry vault shall surcharge the heart with all rapturous marvelings , is only because we ourselves are greater miracles , and superber trophies than all the stars in universal space . Wonder interlocks with wonder ; and then the confounding feeling comes . No cause have we to fancy , that a horse , a dog , a fowl , ever stand transfixed beneath yon skyey load of majesty . But our soul 's arches underfit into its ; and so , prevent the upper arch from falling on us with unsustainable inscrutableness . " Explain ye my deeper mystery , " said the shepherd Chaldean king , smiting his breast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then , I will bestow all my wonderings upon ye , ye stately stars ! " So , in some sort , with Pierre . Explain thou this strange integral feeling in me myself , he thought ? turning upon the fancied face  --  and I will then renounce all other wonders , to gaze wonderingly at thee . But thou hast evoked in me profounder spells than the evoking one , thou face ! For me , thou bast uncovered one infinite , dumb , beseeching countenance of mystery , underlying all the surfaces of visible time and space . But during those two days of his first wild vassalage to his original sensations , Pierre had not been unvisited by less mysterious impulses . Two or three very plain and practical plantings of desirable procedures in reference to some possible homely explication of all this nonsense  --  so he would momentarily denominate it  --  now and then flittingly intermitted his pervading mood of semi-madness . Once he had seized his hat , careless of his accustomed gloves and cane , and found himself in the street , walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . But whither now ? he disenchantingly interrogated himself . Where would you go ? A million to one , those deaf old spinsters can tell you nothing you burn to know . Deaf old spinsters are not used to be the depositaries of such mystical secrecies . But then , they may reveal her name  --  where she dwells , and something , however fragmentary and unsatisfactory , of who she is , and whence . Ay ; but then , in ten minutes after your leaving them , all the houses in Saddle Meadows would be humming with the gossip of Pierre Glendinning engaged to marry Lucy Tartan , and yet running about the country , in ambiguous pursuit of strange young women . That will never do . You remember , do you not , often seeing the Miss Pennies , hatless and without a shawl , hurrying through the village , like two postmen intent on dropping some tit-bit of precious gossip ? What a morsel for them , Pierre , have you , if you now call upon them . Verily , their trumpets are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Miss Pennies are by no means dumb . They blazon very wide . " Now be sure , and say that it was the Miss Pennies , who left the news  --  be sure  --  we  --  the Miss Pennies  --  remember  --  say to Mrs. Glendinning it was we . " Such was the message that now half-humorously occurred to Pierre , as having been once confided to him by the sister spinsters , one evening when they called with a choice present of some very recherche chit-chat for his mother ; but found the manorial lady out ; and so charged her son with it ; hurrying away to all the inferior houses , so as not to be anywhere forestalled in their disclosure . Now , I wish it had been any other house than the Miss Pennies ' ; any other house but theirs , and on my soul I believe I should have gone . But not to them  --  no , that I can not do . It would be sure to reach my mother , and then she would put this and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and farewell forever to all her majestic notions of my immaculate integrity . Patience , Pierre , the population of this region is not so immense . No dense mobs of Nineveh confound all personal identities in Saddle Meadows . Patience ; thou shalt see it soon again ; catch it passing thee in some green lane , sacred to thy evening reveries . She that bears it can not dwell remote . Patience , Pierre .  | Ever are such mysteries best and soonest unraveled by the eventual unraveling of themselves . Or , if you will , go back and get your gloves , and more especially your cane , and begin your own secret voyage of discovery after it . Your cane , I say ; because it will probably be a very long and weary walk . True , just now hinted , that she that bears it can not dwell very remote ; but then her nearness may not be at all conspicuous . So , homeward , and put off thy hat , and let thy cane stay still , good Pierre . Seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ever and anon during those sad two days of deepest sufferance , Pierre would stand reasoning and expostulating with himself ; and by such meditative treatment , reassure his own spontaneous impulses . Doubtless , it was wise and right that so he did ; doubtless : but in a world so full of all dubieties as this , one can never be entirely certain whether another person , however carefully and cautiously conscientious , has acted in all respects conceivable for the very best . But when the two days were gone by , and Pierre began to recognize his former self , as restored to him from its mystic exile , then the thoughts of personally and pointedly seeking out the unknown , either preliminarily by a call upon the sister spinsters , or generally by performing the observant lynx-eyed circuit of the country on foot , and as a crafty inquisitor , dissembling his cause of inquisition ; these and all similar intentions completely abandoned Pierre . He was now diligently striving , with all his mental might , forever to drive the phantom from him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain condition of his being , which was most painful , and every way uncongenial to his natural , wonted self . It had a touch of he knew not what sort of unhealthiness in it , so to speak ; for , in his then ignorance , he could find no better term ; it seemed to have in it a germ of somewhat which , if not quickly extirpated , might insidiously poison and embitter his whole life  --  that choice , delicious life which he had vowed to Lucy for his one pure and comprehensive offering  --  at once a sacrifice and a delight . Nor in these endeavorings did he entirely fail . For the most part , he felt now that he had a power over the comings and the  | goings of the face ; but not on all occasions . Sometimes the old , original mystic tyranny would steal upon him ; the long , dark locks of mournful hair would fall upon his soul , and trail their wonderful melancholy along with them ; the two full , steady , overbrimming eyes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he felt them kindling he could not tell what mysterious fires in the heart at which they aimed . When once this feeling had him fully , then was the perilous time for Pierre . For supernatural as the feeling was , and appealing to all things ultramontane to his soul ; yet was it a delicious sadness to him . Some hazy fairy swam above him in the heavenly ether , and showered down upon him the sweetest pearls of pensiveness . Then he would be seized with a singular impulse to reveal the secret to some one other individual in the world . Only one , not more ; he could not hold all this strange fullness in himself . It must be shared . In such an hour it was , that chancing to encounter Lucy ( her , whom above all others , he did confidingly adore ) , she heard the story of the face ; nor slept at all that night ; nor for a long time freed her pillow completely from wild , Beethoven sounds of distant , waltzing melodie. ; , as of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward and goes backward , as occasion calls . Nimble center , circumference elastic you must have . Now we return to Pierre , wending homeward from his reveries beneath the pine-tree . His burst of impatience against the sublime Italian , Dante , arising from that poet being the one who , in a former time , had first opened to his shuddering eyes the infinite cliffs and gulfs of human mystery and misery ; ? though still more in the way of experimental vision , than of sensational presentiment or experience ( for as yet he had not seen so far and deep as Dante , and therefore was entirely incompetent to meet the grim bard fairly on his peculiar ground ) , this ignorant burst of his young impatience , ? also arising from that half-contemptuous dislike , and sometimes selfish loathing , with which , either naturally feeble or undeveloped minds , regard those dark ravings of the PRESENTIMENT AND VERIFICATION 63  | loftier poets , which are in eternal opposition to their own finespun , shallow dreams of rapturous or prudential Youth ; ? this rash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have carried off with it , all the other forms of his melancholy ? of melancholy it had been  --  and left him now serene again , and ready for any tranquil pleasantness the gods might have in store . For his , indeed , was true Youth 's temperament , ? summary with sadness , swift to joyfulness , and long protracting , and detaining with that joyfulness , when once it came fully nigh to him . As he entered the dining-hall , he saw Dates retiring from another door with his tray . Alone and meditative , by the bared half of the polished table , sat his mother at her dessert ; fruitbaskets and a decanter were before her . On the other leaf of the same table , still lay the cloth , folded back upon itself , and set out with one plate and its usual accompaniments . " Sit down , Pierre ; when I came home ; I was surprised to hear that the phaeton had returned so early , and here I waited dinner for you , until I could wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and get what Dates has but just put away for you there . Heigh-ho ! too plainly I foresee it  --  no more regular dinner-hours , or tea-hours , or supper-hours , in Saddle Meadows , till its young lord is wedded . And that puts me in mind of something , Pierre ; but I 'll defer it till you have eaten a little . Do you know , Pierre , that if you continue these irregular meals of yours , and deprive me so entirely almost of your company , that I shall run fearful risk of getting to be a terrible wine-bibber ; ? yes , could you unalarmed see me sitting all alone here with this decanter , like any old nurse , Pierre ; some solitary , forlorn old nurse , Pierre , deserted by her last friend , and therefore forced to embrace her flask ? " " No , I did not feel any great alarm , sister , " said Pierre , smiling , " since I could not but perceive that the decanter was still full to the stopple . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pierre ; " then changing her voice suddenly ? " but mark me , Mr. Pierre Glen-dinning ! " " Well , Mrs. Mary Glendinning ! "  | " Do you know , sir , that you are very shortly to be married , ? that indeed the day is all but fixed ? " " How ! " cried Pierre , in real joyful astonishment , both at the nature of the tidings , and the earnest tones in which they were conveyed ? " dear , dear mother , you have strangely changed your mind then , my dear mother . " " It is even so , dear brother ; ? before this day month I hope to have a little sister Tartan . " " You talk very strangely , mother , " rejoined Pierre , quickly . " I suppose , then , I have next to nothing to say in the matter ? " " Next to nothing , Pierre ! What indeed could you say to the purpose ? what at all have you to do with it , I should like to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , that men ever have the marrying of themselves ? Juxtaposition marries men . There is but one match-maker in the world , Pierre , and that is Mrs. Juxtaposition , a most notorious lady ! " " Very peculiar , disenchanting sort of talk , this , under the circumstances , sister Mary , " laying down his fork . " Mrs. Juxtaposition , all ! And iii your opinion , mother , does this fine glorious passion only amount to that ? " " Only to that , Pierre ; but mark you : according to my creed ? though this part of it is a little hazy  --  Mrs. Juxtaposition moves her pawns only as she herself is moved to so doing by the spirit . " " Ah ! that sets it all right again , " said Pierre , resuming his fork ? " my appetite returns . But what was that about my being married so soon ? " he added , vainly striving to assume an air of incredulity and unconcern ; " you were joking , I suppose ; it seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just now wandering in the mind a little , on that subject . Are you really thinking of any such thing ? and have you really vanquished your sagacious scruples by yourself , after I had so long and ineffectually sought to do it for you ? Well , I am a million times delighted ; tell me quick ! " " I will , Pierre . You very well know , that from the first hour you apprised me  --  or rather , from a period prior to that  --  from the moment that I , by my own insight , became aware of your love for Lucy , I have always approved it . Lucy is a delicious  | girl ; of honorable descent , a fortune , well-bred , and the very pattern of all that I think amiable and attractive in a girl of seventeen . " " Well , well , well , " cried Pierre rapidly and impetuously ; " we both knew that before . " " Well , well , well , Pierre , " retorted his mother , mockingly . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ill , ill , to torture me so , mother ; go on , do ! " " But notwithstanding my admiring approval of your choice , Pierre ; yet , as you know , I have resisted your entreaties for my consent to your speedy marriage , because I thought that a girl of scarcely seventeen , and a boy scarcely twenty , should not be in such a hurry ; ? there was plenty of time , I thought , which could be profitably employed by both . " " Permit me here to interrupt you , mother . Whatever you may have seen in me ; she , ? 1 mean Lucy , has never been in the slightest hurry to be married ; ? that 's all . But I shall regard it as a lapstts-lingua in you . " " Undoubtedly , a lapsus . But listen to me . I have been carefully observing both you and Lucy of late ; and that has made me think further of the matter . Now , Pierre , if you were in any profession , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a farmer 's wife , and you my child , working in my fields ; why , then , you and Lucy should still wait awhile . But as you have nothing to do but to think of Lucy by day , and dream of her by night , and as she is in the same predicament , I suppose , with respect to you ; and as the consequence of all this begins to be discernible in a certain , just perceptible , and quite harmless thinness , so to speak , of the cheek ; but a very conspicuous and dangerous febrileness of the eye ; therefore , I choose the lesser of two evils ; and now you have my permission to be married , as soon as the thing can be done with propriety . I dare say you have no objection to have the wedding take place before Christmas , the present month being the first of summer . " Pierre said nothing ; but leaping to his feet , threw his two arms around his mother , and kissed her repeatedly . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down  | again . I desire now to say a little concerning less attractive , but quite necessary things connected with this affair . You know , that by your father 's will , these lands and ? " " Miss Lucy , my mistress , " said Dates , throwing open the door . Pierre sprang to his feet ; but as if suddenly mindful of his mother 's presence , composed himself again , though he still approached the door . Lucy entered , carrying a little basket of strawberries . " Why , how do you do , my dear , " said Mrs. Glendinning affectionately . " This is an unexpected pleasure . " " Yes ; and I suppose that Pierre here is a little surprised too ; seeing that he was to call upon me this evening , and not I upon him before sundown . But I took a sudden fancy for a solitary stroll , ? the afternoon was such a delicious one ; and chancing ? it was only chancing  --  to pass through the Locust Lane leading hither , I met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . Yes , buy them , miss ' ? said he . And how do you know I want to buy them ? ' returned I. I do n't want to buy them : ? Yes , you do , miss ; they ought to be twenty-six cents , but I 'll take thirteen cents , that being my shilling . I always want the odd half cent , I do . Come , I ca n't wait , I have been expecting you long enough . " A very sagacious little imp , " laughed Mrs. Glendinning . " Impertinent little rascal , " cried Pierre . " And am I not now the silliest of all silly girls , to be telling you my adventures so very frankly , " smiled Lucy . " No ; but the most celestial of all innocents , " cried Pierre , in a rhapsody of delight . " Frankly open is the flower , that hath nothing but purity to show . " " Now , my dear little Lucy , " said Mrs. Glendinning , " let Pierre take off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us . Pierre has put back the dinner so , the tea-hour will come now very soon . " " Thank you ; but I can not stay this time . Look , I have forgotten my own errand ; I brought these strawberries for you , Mrs. Glendinning , and for Pierre ; Pierre is so wonderfully fond of them . "  | " I was audacious enough to think as much , " cried Pierre ; " for you and me , you see , mother ; for you and me , you understand that , I hope . " " Perfectly , my dear brother . " Lucy blushed . " How warm it is , Mrs. Glendinning . " " Very warm , Lucy . So you wo n't stay to tea ? " " No , I must go now ; just a little stroll , that 's all ; good-bye ! Now do n't be following me , Pierre . Mrs. Glendinning , will you keep Pierre back ? I know you want him ; you were talking over some private affair when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And you were not very far from right , Lucy , " said Mrs. Glendinning , making no sign to stay her departure . " Yes , business of the highest importance , " said Pierre , fixing his eyes upon Lucy significantly . At this moment , Lucy just upon the point of her departure , was hovering near the door ; the setting sun , streaming through the window , bathed her whole form in golden loveliness and light ; that wonderful , and most vivid transparency of her clear Welsh complexion , now fairly glowed like rosy snow . Her flowing , white , blue-ribboned dress , fleecily invested her . Pierre almost thought that she could only depart the house by floating out of the open window , instead of actually stepping from the door . All her aspect to him , was that moment touched with an indescribable gayety , buoyancy , fragility , and an unearthly evanescence . Youth is no philosopher . Not into young Pierre 's heart did there then come the thought , that as the glory of the rose endures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girlish airiness and bewitchingness , passes from the earth almost as soon ; as jealously absorbed by those frugal elements , which again incorporate that translated girlish bloom , into the first expanding flowerbud . Not into young Pierre , did there then steal that thought of utmost sadness ; pondering on the inevitable evanescence of all earthly loveliness ; which makes the sweetest things of life only food for ever-devouring and omnivorous melancholy . Pierre 's thought was different from this , and yet somehow akin to it .  | This to be my wife ? I that but the other day weighed an hundred and fifty pounds of solid avoirdupois ; ? 1 to wed this heavenly fleece ? Methinks one husbandly embrace would break her airy zone , and she exhale upward to that heaven whence she hath hither come , condensed to mortal sight . It can not be ; I am of heavy earth , and she of airy light . By heaven , but marriage is an impious thing ! Meanwhile , as these things ran through his soul , Mrs. Glendinning also had thinkings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she cried , at last , artistically turning her gay head a little sideways ? " very beautiful , indeed ; this , I suppose , is all premeditated for my entertainment . Orpheus finding his Eurydice ; or Pluto stealing Proserpine . Admirable ! It might almost stand for either . " " No , " said Pierre , gravely ; " it is the last . Now , first I see a meaning there . " Yes , he added to himself inwardly , I am Pluto stealing Proserpine ; and every accepted lover is . " And you would be very stupid , brother Pierre , if you did not see something there , " said his mother , still that way pursuing her own different train of thought . " The meaning thereof is this : Lucy has commanded me to stay you ; but in reality she wants you to go along with her . Well , you may go as far as the porch ; but then , you must return , for we have not concluded our little affair , you know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight degree of affectionate patronizing in the manner of the resplendent , full-blown Mrs. Glendinning , toward the delicate and shrinking girlhood of young Lucy . She treated her very much as she might have treated some surpassingly beautiful and precocious child ; and this was precisely what Lucy was . Looking beyond the present period , Mrs. Glendinning could not but perceive , that even in Lucy 's womanly maturity , Lucy would still be a child to her ; because , she , elated , felt , that in a certain intellectual vigor , so to speak , she was the essential opposite of Lucy , whose sympathetic mind and person had both been cast in one mold of wondrous delicacy . But here Mrs. Glendinning was both right and wrong . So far as she here saw a difference between herself and Lucy Tartan , she did not err ; but so far  --  and that was very far  --  as she thought she saw  | her innate superiority to her in the absolute scale of being , here she very widely and immeasurably erred . For what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essence compatible with created being ; and angelicalness hath no vulgar vigor in it . And that thing which very often prompts to the display of any vigor  --  which thing , in man or woman , is at bottom nothing but ambition  --  this quality is purely earthly , and not angelical . It is false , that any angels fell by reason of ambition . Angels never fall ; and never feel ambition . Therefore , benevolently , and affectionately , and all-sincerely , as thy heart , oh , Mrs. Glendinning ! now standest affected toward the fleecy Lucy ; still , lady , thou dost very sadly mistake it , when the proud , double-arches of the bright breastplate of thy bosom , expand with secret triumph over one , whom thou so sweetly , but still so patronizingly stylest , The Little Lucy . But ignorant of these further insights , that very superb-looking lady , now waiting Pierre 's return from the portico door , sat in a very matronly revery ; her eyes fixed upon the decanter of amber-hued wine before her . Whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between that remarkably slender , and gracefully cut little pint-decanter , brimfull of light , golden wine , or not , there is no absolute telling now . But really , the peculiarly , and reminiscently , and forecastingly complacent expression of her beaming and benevolent countenance , seemed a tell-tale of some conceit very much like the following : ? Yes , she 's a very pretty little pint-decanter of a girl : a very pretty little Pale Sherry pint-decanter of a girl ; and I  --  I 'm a quartdecanter of  --  of  --  Port  --  potent Port ! Now , Sherry for boys , and Port for men  --  so I 've heard men say ; and Pierre is but a boy ; but when his father wedded me , ? why , his father was turned of five-and-thirty years . After a little further waiting for him , Mrs. Glendinning heard Pierre 's voice ? " Yes , before eight o'clock at least , Lucy ? no fear " ; and then the hall door banged , and Pierre returned to her . But now she found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business capacity in her mercurial son ;  | fairly capsizing him again into , there was no telling what sea of pleasant pensiveness . " Dear me ! some other time , sister Mary . " " Not this time ; that is very certain , Pierre . Upon my word I shall have to get Lucy kidnapped , and temporarily taken out of the country , and you handcuffed to the table , else there will be no having a preliminary understanding with you , previous to calling in the lawyers . Well , I shall yet manage you , one way or other . Good-bye , Pierre ; I see you do n't want me now . I suppose I sha n't see you till to-morrow morning . Luckily , I have a very interesting book to read . Adieu ! " But Pierre remained in his chair ; his gaze fixed upon the stilly sunset beyond the meadows , and far away to the now golden hills . A glorious , softly glorious , and most gracious evening , which seemed plainly a tongue to all humanity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy ; Love reigns throughout all worlds that sunsets visit ; it is a foolish ghost-story ; there is no such thing as misery . Would 1.0v e , which is omnipotent , have misery in his domain ? Would the god of sunlight decree gloom ? It is a flawless , speekless , fleckless , beautiful world throughout ; joy now , and joy forever ! Then the face , which before had seemed mournfully and reproachfully looking out upon him from the effulgent sunset 's heart ; the face slid from him ; and left alone there with his soul 's joy , thinking that that very night he would utter the magic word of marriage to his Lucy ; not a happier youth than Pierre Glendinning sat watching that day 's sun go down . IV . After this morning of gayety , this noon of tragedy , and this evening so full of chequered pensiveness ; Pierre now possessed his soul in joyful mildness and steadfastness ; feeling none of that wild anguish of anticipative rapture , which , in weaker minds , too often dislodges Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was warm , but dark  --  for the moon was not risen yet  --  and as Pierre passed on beneath the pendulous canopies of the long arms of the weeping elms of the village , an  | almost impenetrable blackness surrounded him , but entered not the gently illuminated halls of his heart . He had not gone very far , when in the distance beyond , he noticed a light moving along the opposite side of the road , and slowly approaching . As it was the custom for some of the more elderly , and perhaps timid inhabitants of the village , to carry a lantern when going abroad of so dark a night , this object conveyed no impression of novelty to Pierre ; still , as it silently drew nearer and nearer , the one only distinguishable thing before him , he somehow felt a nameless presentiment that the light must be seeking him . He had nearly gained the cottage door , when the lantern crossed over toward him ; and as his nimble hand was laid at last upon the little wicket-gate , which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a heavy hand was laid upon himself , and at the same moment , the lantern was lifted toward his face , by a hooded and obscure-looking figure , whose half-averted countenance he could but indistinctly discern . But Pierre 's own open aspect seemed to have been quickly scrutinized by the other . " I have a letter for Pierre Glendinning , " said the stranger , " and I believe this is he " At the same moment , a letter was drawn forth , and sought his hand . " For me ! " exclaimed Pierre , faintly , starting at the strangeness of the encounter ; ? " methinks this is an odd time and place to deliver your mail ; ? who are you ? ? Stay ! " But without waiting an answer , the messenger had already turned about , and was re-crossing the road . In the first impulse of the moment , Pierre stepped forward , and would have pursued him ; but smiling at his own causeless curiosity and trepidation , paused again ; and softly turned over the letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought he , circularly moving his thumb upon the seal ; no one writes me but from abroad ; and their letters come through the office ; and as for Lucy  --  pooh ! ? when she herself is within , she would hardly have her notes delivered at her own gate . Strange ! but I 'll in , and read it ; ? no , not that ; ? I come to read again in her own sweet heart  --  that dear missive to me from heaven , ? and this impertinent letter would preoccupy me . I 'll wait till I go home . He entered the gate , and laid his hand upon the cottage  | knocker . Its sudden coolness caused a slight , and , at any other time , an unaccountable sympathetic sensation in his hand . To his unwonted mood , the knocker seemed to say ? " Enter not ! ? Begone , and first read thy note . " Yielding now , half alarmed , and half bantering with himself , to these shadowy interior monitions , he half-unconsciously quitted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retracing his homeward path . He equivocated with himself no more ; the gloom of the air had now burst into his heart , and extinguished its light ; then , first in all his life , Pierre felt the irresistible admonitions and intuitions of Fate . He entered the hall unnoticed , passed up to his chamber , and hurriedly locking the door iii the dark , lit his lamp . As the summoned flame illuminated the room , Pierre , standing before the round center-table , where the lamp was placed , with his hand yet on the brass circle which regulated the wick , started at a figure in the opposite mirror . It bore the outline of Pierre , but now strangely filled with features transformed , and unfamiliar to him ; feverish eagerness , fear , and nameless forebodings of ill ! Ile threw himself into a chair , and for a time vainly struggled with the incomprehensible power that possessed him . Then , as he avertedly drew the letter from his bosom , he whispered to himself  --  Out on thee , Pierre ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will turn out to be an invitation to a supper to-morrow night ; quick , fool , and write the stereotyped reply : Mr. Pierre Glendinning will be very happy to accept Miss So-and-So 's polite invitation . Still for the moment he held the letter averted . The messenger had so hurriedly accosted him , and delivered his duty , that Pierre had not yet so much as gained one glance at the superscription of the note . And now the wild thought passed through his mind of what would be the result , should he deliberately destroy the note , without so much as looking at the hand that had addressed it . Hardly had this half-crazy conceit fully made itself legible in his soul , when he was conscious of his two hands meeting in the middle of the sundered note ! He leapt from his chair  --  By heaven ! he murmured , unspeakably shocked at the  | intensity of that mood which had caused him unwittingly as it were , to do for the first time in his whole life , an act of which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him was none of his own willful seeking ; yet now he swiftly felt conscious that he had perhaps a little encouraged it , through that certain strange infatuation of fondness , which the human mind , however vigorous , sometimes feels for any emotion at once novel and mystical . Not willingly , at such times  --  never mind how fearful we may be  --  do we try to dissolve the spell which seems , for the time , to admit us , all astonished , into the vague vestibule of the spiritual worlds . Pierre now seemed distinctly to feel two antagonistic agencies within him ; one of which was just struggling into his consciousness , and each of which was striving for the mastery ; and between whose respective final ascendencies , he thought he could perceive , though but shadowly , that he himself was to be the only umpire . One bade him finish the selfish destruction of the note ; for in some dark way the reading of it would irretrievably entangle his fate . The other bade him dismiss all misgivings ; not because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dismiss them was the manlier part , never mind what might betide . This good angel seemed mildly to say  --  Read , Pierre , though by reading thou may'st entangle thyself , yet may'st thou thereby disentangle others . Read , and feel that best blessedness which , with the sense of all duties discharged , holds happiness indifferent . The bad angel insinuatingly breathed  --  Read it not , dearest Pierre ; but destroy it , and be happy . Then , at the blast of his noble heart , the bad angel shrunk up into nothingness ; and the good one defined itself clearer and more clear , and came nigher and more nigh to him , smiling sadly but benignantly ; while forth from the infinite distances wonderful harmonies stole into his heart ; so that every vein in him pulsed to some heavenly swell . " The name at the end of this letter will be wholly strange to thee . Hitherto my existence has been utterly unknown to thee . This letter will touch thee and pain thee . Willingly would  | I spare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me witness , that did I think that the suffering these lines would give thee , would , in the faintest degree , compare with what mine has been , I would forever withhold them .

Dearest Pierre , my brother , my own father 's child ! art thou an angel , that thou canst overleap all the heartless usages and fashions of a banded world , that will call thee fool , fool , fool ! and curse thee , if thou yieldest to that heavenly impulse which alone can lead thee to respond to the long tvrannizing , and now at last unquenchable yearnings of my bursting heart ?

He hung half-lifeless in his chair ; his hand , clutching the letter , was pressed against his heart , as if some assassin had stabbed him and fled ; and Pierre was now holding the dagger in the wound , to stanch the outgushing of the blood .

And as the mariner , shipwrecked and cast on the beach , has much ado to escape the recoil of the wave that hurled him there ; so Pierre long struggled , and struggled , to escape the recoil of that anguish , which had dashed him out of itself , upon the beach of his swoon .

Thou movest before me , in rainbows spun of thy tears !

" He could not stay in his chamber : the house contracted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; bare-headed he rushed from the place , and only in the infinite air , found scope for that boundless expansion of his life .  | IN THEM precise tracings-out and subtile causations , the strongest and fieriest emotions of life defy all analytical insight . We see the cloud , and feel its bolt ; but meteorology only idly essays a critical scrutiny as to how that cloud became charged , and how this bolt so stuns . The metaphysical writers confess , that the most impressive , sudden , and overwhelming event , as well as the minutest , is but the product of an infinite series of infinitely involved and untraceable foregoing occurrences . just so with every motion of the heart . Why this cheek kindles with a noble enthusiasm ; why that lip curls in scorn ; these are things not wholly imputable to the immediate apparent cause , which is only one link in the chain ; but to a long line of dependencies whose further part is lost in the mid-regions of the impalpable air . Idle then would it be to attempt by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and memory , and inmost life , and nature of Pierre , as to show why it was that a piece of intelligence which , in the natural course of things , many amiable gentlemen , both young and old , have been known to receive with a momentary feeling of surprise , and then a little curiosity to know more , and at last an entire unconcern ; idle would it be , to attempt to show how to Pierre it rolled down on his soul like melted lava , and left so deep a deposit of desolation , that all his subsequent endeavors never restored the original temples to the soil , nor all his culture completely revived its buried bloom . But some random hints may suffice to deprive a little of its 78  | strangeness , that tumultuous mood , into which so small a note had thrown him . There had long stood a shrine in the fresh-foliaged heart of Pierre , up to which he ascended by many tableted steps of remembrance ; and around which annually he had hung fresh wreaths of a sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last , by such successive votive offerings of his being ; this shrine seemed , and was indeed , a place for the celebration of a chastened joy , rather than for any melancholy rites . But though thus mantled , and tangled with garlands , this shrine was of marble  --  a niched pillar , deemed solid and eternal , and from whose top radiated all those innumerable sculptured scrolls and branches , which supported the entire one-pillared temple of his moral life ; as in some beautiful Gothic oratories , one central pillar , trunk-like , upholds the roof . In this shrine , in this niche of this pillar , stood the perfect marble form of his departed father ; without blemish , unclouded , snow-white , and serene ; Pierre 's fond personification of perfect human goodness and virtue . Before this shrine , Pierre poured out the fullness of all young life 's most reverential thoughts and beliefs . Not to God had Pierre ever gone in his heart , unless by ascending the steps of that shrine , and so making it the vestibule of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond Prince Mausolus is that mortal sire , who , after an honorable , pure course of life , dies , and is buried , as in a choice fountain , in the filial breast of a tender-hearted and intellectually appreciative child . For at that period , the Solomonic insights have not poured their turbid tributaries into the pure-flowing well of the childish life . Bare preservative virtue , too , have those heavenly waters . Thrown into that fountain , all sweet recollections become marbleized ; so that things which in themselves were evanescent , thus became unchangeable and eternal . So , some rare waters in I ) crbyshire will petrify birds ' - nests . But if fate preserves the father to a later time , too often the filial obsequies are less profound ; the canonization less ethereal . The eye-expanded boy perceives , or vaguely thinks he perceives , slight specks and flaws in the character he once so wholly reverenced.  | When Pierre was twelve years old , his father had died , leaving behind him , in the general voice of the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the heart of his wife , a green memory of many healthy days of unclouded and joyful wedded life , and in the inmost soul of Pierre , the impression of a bodily form of rare manly beauty and benignity , only rivaled by the supposed perfect mold in which his virtuous heart had been cast . Of pensive evenings , by the wide winter fire , or in summer , in the southern piazza , when that mystical night-silence so peculiar to the country would summon up in the minds of Pierre and his mother , long trains of the images of the past ; leading all that spiritual procession , majestically and holily walked the venerated form of the departed husband and father . Then their talk would be reminiscent and serious , but sweet ; and again , and again , still deep and deeper , was stamped in Pierre 's soul the cherished conceit , that his virtuous father , so beautiful on earth , was now uncorruptibly sainted in heaven . So choicely , and in some degree , secludedly nurtured , Pierre though now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become so thoroughly initiated into that darker , though truer aspect of things , which an entire residence in the city from the earliest period of life , almost inevitably engraves upon the mind of any keenly observant and reflective youth of Pierre 's present years . So that up to this period , in his breast , all remained as it had been ; and to Pierre , his father 's shrine seemed spotless , and still new as the marble of the tomb of him of Arimathea . Judge , then , how all-desolating and withering the blast , that for Pierre , in one night , stripped his holiest shrine of all overlaid bloom , and buried the mild statue of the saint beneath the prostrated ruins of the soul 's temple itself , As the vine flourishes , and the grape empurples close up to the very walls and muzzles of cannoned Ehrenbreitstein ; so do the sweetest joys of life grow in the very jaws of its perils .

Pierre ! thou art foolish ; rebuild  --  no , not that , for thy shrine still stands ; it stands , Pierre , firmly stands ; smellest thou not its yet undeparted , embowering bloom ?

Oh ! mock not the poniarded heart . The stabbed man knows the steel ; prate not to him that it is only a tickling feather . Feels he not the interior gash ? What does this blood on my vesture ? and what does this pang in my soul ? And here again , not unreasonably , might invocations go up to those Three Weird Ones , that tend Life 's loom . Again we might ask them , What threads were those , oh , ye Weird Ones , that ye wove in the years foregone ; that now to Pierre , they so unerringly conduct electric presentiments , that his woe is woe , his father no more a saint , and Isabel a sister indeed ? Ah , fathers and mothers ! all the world round , be heedful , ? give heed ! Thy little one may not now comprehend the meaning of those words and those signs , by which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinister thing ye would hint . Not now he knows ; not very much even of the externals he consciously remarks ; but if , in after-life , Fate puts the chemic key of the cipher into his hands ; then how swiftly and how wonderfully , he reads all the obscurest and most obliterate inscriptions he finds in his memory ; yea , and rummages himself all over , for still hidden writings to read . Oh , darkest lessons of Life have thus been read ; all faith in Virtue been murdered , and youth gives itself up to an infidel scorn .  | But not thus , altogether , was it now with Pierre ; yet so like , in some points , that the above true warning may not misplacedly stand . His father had died of a fever ; and , as is not uncommon in such maladies , toward his end , he at intervals lowly wandered in his mind . At such times , by unobserved , but subtle arts , the devoted family attendants had restrained his wife from being present at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love drew him ever to that bed ; they heeded not innocent little Pierre , when his father was delirious ; and so , one evening , when the shadows intermingled with the curtains ; and all the chamber was hushed ; and Pierre but dimly saw his father 's face ; and the fire on the hearth lay in a broken temple of wonderful coals ; then a strange , plaintive , infinitely pitiable , low voice , stole forth from the testered bed ; and Pierre heard , ? " My daughter ! my daughter ! " " He wanders again , " said the nurse . " Dear , dear father ! " sobbed the child ? " thou bast not a daughter , but here is thy own little Pierre . " But again the unregardful voice iii the bed was heard ; and now in a sudden , pealing wail , ? " My daughter ! ? God ! God ! ? my daughter ! " The child snatched the dying man 's hand ; it faintly grew to his grasp ; but on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emptily lifted itself , and emptily caught , as if at some other childish fingers . Then both hands dropped on the sheet ; and in the twinkling shadows of the evening little Pierre seemed to see , that while the hand which he held wore a faint , feverish flush , the other empty one was ashy white as a leper 's . " It is past , " whispered the nurse , " he will wander so no more now till midnight , ? that is his wont " And then , in her heart , she wondered how it was , that so excellent a gentleman , and so thoroughly good a man , should wander so ambiguously in his mind ; and trembled to think of that mysterious thing in the soul , which seems to acknowledge no human jurisdiction , but in spite of the individual 's own innocent self , will still dream horrid dreams , and mutter unmentionable thoughts ; and into Pierre 's awe-stricken , childish soul , there entered a kindred , though  | still more nebulous conceit . But it belonged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child soon threw other and sweeter remembrances over it , and covered it up ; and at last , it was blended with all other dim things , and imaginings of dimness ; and so , seemed to survive to no real life in Pierre . But though through many long years the henbane showed no leaves in his soul ; yet the sunken seed was there : and the first glimpse of Isabel 's letter caused it to spring forth , as by magic . Then , again , the long-hushed , plaintive and infinitely pitiable voice was heard , ? " My daughter ! my daughter ! " followed by the compunctious " God ! God ! " And to Pierre , once again the empty hand lifted itself , and once again the ashy hand fell . In the cold courts of justice the dull head demands oaths , and holy writ proofs ; but in the warm halls of the heart one single , untestified memory 's spark shall suffice to enkindle such a blaze of evidence , that all the corners of conviction are as suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which on every side whirls its reddened brands . In a locked , round-windowed closet connecting with the chamber of Pierre , and whither he had always been wont to go , in those sweetly awful hours , when the spirit crieth to the spirit , Come into solitude with me , twin-brother ; come away : a secret have I ; let me whisper it to thee aside ; in this closet , sacred to the Tadmor privacies and repose of the sometimes solitary Pierre , there hung , by long cords from the cornice , a small portrait in oil , before which Pierre had many a time trancedly stood . Had this painting hung in any annual public exhibition , and in its turn been described in print by the casual glancing critics , they would probably have described it thus , and truthfully : " An impromptu portrait of a fine-looking , gay-hearted , youthful gentleman . He is lightly , and , as it were , airily and but grazingly seated in , or rather fittingly tenanting an old-fashioned chair of Malacca . One arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of the chair , while the fingers of the other hand play with his gold watch-seal and key . The free-templed head is sideways turned , with a peculiarly bright ,  | and care-free , morning expression . He seems as if just dropped in for a visit upon some familiar acquaintance . Altogether , the painting is exceedingly clever and cheerful ; with a fine , offhanded expression about it . Undoubtedly a portrait , and no fancy-piece ; and , to hazard a vague conjecture , by an amateur . " So bright , and so cheerful then ; so trim , and so young ; so singularly healthful , and handsome ; what subtile element could so steep this whole portrait , that , to the wife of the original , it was namelessly unpleasant and repelling ? The mother of Pierre could never abide this picture which she had always asserted did signally belie her husband . Her fond memories of the departed refused to hang one single wreath around it . It is not he , she would emphatically and almost indignantly exclaim , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dissent from the opinion of nearly all the other connections and relatives of the deceased . But the portrait which she held to do justice to her husband , correctly to convey his features in detail , and more especially their truest , and finest , and noblest combined expression ; this portrait was a much larger one , and in the great drawing-room below occupied the most conspicuous and honorable place on the wall . Even to Pierre these two paintings had always seemed strangely dissimilar . And as the larger one had been painted many years after the other , and therefore brought the original pretty nearly within his own childish recollections ; therefore , he himself could not but deem it by far the more truthful and lifelike presentation of his father . So that the mere preference of his mother , however strong , was not at all surprising to him , but rather coincided with his own conceit . Yet not for this , must the other portrait be so decidedly rejected . Because , in the first place , there was a difference in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the wide difference of the styles of the respective artists , and the wide difference of those respective , semi-reflected , ideal faces , which , even in the presence of the original , a spiritual artist will rather choose to draw from than from the fleshy face , however brilliant and fine . Moreover , while the larger portrait was that of a middle-aged , married man , and seemed to possess all the nameless and slightly portly  | tranquillities , incident to that condition when a felicitous one ; the smaller portrait painted a brisk , unentangled , young bachelor , gayly ranging up and down in the world ; light-hearted , and a very little bladish perhaps ; and charged to the lips with the first uncloying morning fullness and freshness of life . Here , certainly , large allowance was to be made in any careful , candid estimation of these portraits . To Pierre this conclusion had become well-nigh irresistible , when he placed side by side two portraits of himself ; one taken in his early childhood , a frocked and belted boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown youth of sixteen . Except an indestructible , all-surviving something in the eyes and on the temples , Pierre could hardly recognize the loud-laughing boy in the tall , and pensively smiling youth . If a few years , then , can have in me made all . this difference , why not in my father ? thought Pierre . Besides all this , Pierre considered the history , and , so to speak , the family legend of the smaller painting . In his fifteenth year , it was made a present to him by an old maiden aunt , who resided in the city , and who cherished the memory of Pierre 's father , with all that wonderful amaranthine devotion which an advanced maiden sister ever feels for the idea of a beloved younger brother , now dead and irrevocably gone . As the only child of that brother , Pierre was an object of the warmest and most extravagant attachment on the part of this lonely aunt , who seemed to see , transformed into youth once again , the likeness , and very soul of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pierre . Though the portrait we speak of was inordinately prized by her , yet at length the strict canon of her romantic and imaginative love asserted the portrait to be Pierre 's  --  for Pierre was not only his father 's only child , but his namesake  --  so soon as Pierre should be old enough to value aright so holy and inestimable a treasure . She had accordingly sent it to him , trebly boxed , and finally covered with a water-proof cloth ; and it was delivered at Saddle Meadows , by an express , confidential messenger , an old gentleman of leisure , once her forlorn , because rejected gallant , but now her contented , and chatty neighbor. 1lenceforth , before a gold-framed and gold-lidded ivory miniatiere , -a fraternal gift  --  Aunt Dorothea now offered up her  | morning and her evening rites , to the memory of the noblest and handsomest of brothers . Yet an annual visit to the far closet of Pierre  --  no slight undertaking now for one so stricken in years , and every way infirm  --  attested the earnestness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of self , which had induced her voluntarily to part with the precious memorial . " Tell me , aunt , " the child Pierre had early said to her , long before the portrait became his ? " tell me , aunt , how this chairportrait , as you call it , was painted ; ? who painted it ? ? whose chair was this ? ? have you the chair now ? ? I do n't see it in your room here ; ? what is papa looking at so strangely ? ? I should like to know now , what papa was thinking of , then . Do , now , dear aunt , tell me all about this picture , so that when it is mine , as you promise me , I shall know its whole history . " " Sit down , then , and be very still and attentive , my dear child , " said Aunt Dorothea ; while she a little averted her head , and tremulously and inaccurately sought her pocket , till little Pierre cried ? " Why , aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little book , is it , that you are going to take out and read to me ? " " My handkerchief , my child . " " Why , aunt , here it is , at your elbow ; here , on the table ; here , aunt ; take it , do . Oh , do n't tell me any thing about the picture , now ; I wo n't hear it . " " Be still , my darling Pierre , " said his aunt , taking the handkerchief , " draw the curtain a little , dearest ; the light hurts my eyes . Now , go into the closet , and bring me my dark shawl ; ? take your time. ? There ; thank you , Pierre ; now sit down again , and I will begin. ? The picture was painted long ago , my child ; you were not born then . " " Not born ? " cried little Pierre . " Not born , " said his aunt . " Well , go on , aunt ; but do n't tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little Pierre at all , and yet my father was alive . Go on , aunt , ? do , do ! " " Why , how nervous you are getting , my child ; ? be patient ; I am very old , Pierre ; and old people never like to be hurried . "  | " Now , my own dear Aunt Dorothea , do forgive me this once , and go on with your story . " " When your poor father was quite a young man , my child , and was on one of his long autumnal visits to his friends in this city , he was rather intimate at times with a cousin of his , Ralph Winwood , who was about his own age , ? a fine youth he was , too , Pierre . " " I never saw him , aunt ; pray , where is he now ? " interrupted Pierre ; ? does he live in the country , now , as mother and I do ? " " Yes , my child ; but a far-away , beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I trust . " " Dead , " sighed little Pierre ? " go on , aunt . " " Now , cousin Ralph had a great love for painting , my child ; and he spent many hours in a room , hung all round with pictures and portraits ; and there he had his easel and brushes ; and much liked to paint his friends , and hang their faces on his walls ; so that when all alone by himself , he yet had plenty of company , who always wore their best expressions to him , and never once ruffled him , by ever getting cross or ill-natured , little Pierre . Often , he had besought your father to sit to him ; saying , that his silent circle of friends would never be complete , till your father consented to join them . But in those days , my child , your father was always in motion . It was hard for me to get him to stand still , while I tied his cravat ; for he never came to any one hut me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and putting off cousin Ralph . Some other time , cousin ; not to-day ; ? to-morrow , perhaps ; ? or next week ; ' ? and so , at last cousin Ralph began to despair . But I 'll catch him yet , cried sly cousin Ralph . So now he said nothing more to your father about the matter of painting him ; but every pleasant morning kept his easel and brushes and every thing in readiness ; so as to be ready the first moment your lather should chance to drop in upon him from his long strolls ; for it was now and then your father 's wont to pay flying little visits to cousin Ralph in his painting-room. ? But , my child , you may draw back the curtain now  --  it 's getting very dim here , seems to me . " " Well , I thought so all along , aunt , " said little Pierre , obeying ; ' hi It did n't you say the light hurt your eyes ? "  | " But it does not now , little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , go on , aunt ; you ca n't think how interested I am , " said little Pierre , drawing his stool close up to the quilted satin hem of his good Aunt Dorothea 's dress . " I will , my child . But first let me tell you , that about this time there arrived in the port , a cabin-full of French emigrants of quality ; ? poor people , Pierre , who were forced to fly from their native land , because of the cruel , blood-shedding times there . But you have read all that in the little history I gave you , a good while ago . " " I know all about it ; ? the French Revolution , " said little Pierre . " What a famous little scholar you are , my dear child , " ? said Aunt Dorothea , faintly smiling ? " among those poor , but noble emigrants , there was a beautiful young girl , whose sad fate afterward made a great noise in the city , and made many eyes to weep , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " How ? how ? aunt ; ? I do n't understand ; ? did she disappear then , aunt ? " " I was a little before my story , child . Yes , she did disappear , and never was heard of again ; but that was afterward , some time afterward , my child . I am very sure it was ; I could take my oath of that , Pierre . " " Why , dear aunt , " said little Pierre , " how earnestly you talk ? after what ? your voice is getting very strange ; do now ; ? do n't talk that way ; you frighten me so , aunt . " " Perhaps it is this bad cold I have to-day ; it makes my voice a little hoarse , I fear , Pierre . But I will try and not talk so hoarsely again . Well , my child , some time before this beautiful young lady disappeared , indeed it was only shortly after the poor emigrants landed , your father made her acquaintance ; and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wants of the strangers , for they were very poor indeed , having been stripped of every thing , save a little trifling jewelry , which could not go very far . At last , the friends of your father endeavored to dissuade him from visiting these people so much ; they were fearful that as the young lady was so very beautiful , and a little inclined to be intriguing  --  so some said  --  your father  | might be tempted to many her ; which would not have been a wise thing in him ; for though the young lady might have been very beautiful , and good-hearted , yet no one on this side the water certainly knew her history ; and she was a foreigner ; and would not have made so suitable and excellent a match for your father as your dear mother afterward did , my child . But , for myself , I  --  who always knew your father very well in all his intentions , and he was very confidential with me , too  --  I , for my part , never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry the strange young lady . At any rate , he at last discontinued his visits to the emigrants ; and it was after this that the young lady disappeared . Some said that she must have voluntarily but secretly returned into her own country ; and others declared that she must have been kidnapped by French emissaries ; for , after her disappearance , rumor began to hint that she was of the noblest birth , and some ways allied muttered of drownings , and other dark things ; which one always hears hinted when people disappear , and no one can find them . But though your father and many other gentlemen moved heaven and earth to find trace of her , yet , as I said before , my child , she never reappeared . " " The poor French lady ! " sighed little Pierre . " Aunt , I 'm afraid she was murdered . " " Poor lady , there is no telling , " said his aunt . " But listen , for I am coming to the picture again . Now , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my child , cousin Ralph was one of those who a little fancied that your father was courting her ; but cousin Ralph being a quiet young man , and a scholar , not well acquainted with what is wise , or what is foolish in the great world ; cousin Ralph would not have been at all mortified had your father really wedded with the refugee young lady . So vainly thinking , as I told you , that your father was courting her , he fancied it would be a very fine thing if he could paint your father as her wooer ; that is , paint him just after his coming from his daily visits to the emigrants . So he watched his chance ; every thing being ready in his painting-room , as I told you before ; and one morning , sure enough , in dropped your father  | from his walk . But before he came into the room , cousin Ralph had spied him from the window ; and when your father entered , cousin Ralph had the sitting-chair ready drawn out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and pretended to be very busy painting . He said to your father ? ' Glad to see you , cousin Pierre ; I am just about something here ; sit right down there now , and tell me the news ; and I 'll sally out with you presently . And tell us something of the emigrants , cousin Pierre , ' he slyly added ? wishing , you see , to get your father 's thoughts running that supposed wooing way , so that he might catch some sort of corresponding expression you sec , little Pierre . " " I do n't know that I precisely understand , aunt ; but go on , I am so interested ; do go on , dear aunt . " " Well , by many little cunning shifts and contrivances , cousin Ralph kept your father there sitting , and sitting in the chair , rattling and rattling away , and so self-forgetful too , that he never heeded that all the while sly cousin Ralph was painting and painting just as fast as ever he could ; and only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , cousin Ralph was stealing his portrait , my child . " " Not stealing it , I hope , " said Pierre , " that would be very wicked . " " Well , then , we wo n't call it stealing , since I am sure that cousin Ralph kept your father all the time off from him , and so , could not have possibly picked his pocket , though indeed , he slyly picked his portrait , so to speak . And if indeed it was stealing , or any thing of that sort ; yet seeing how much comfort that portrait has been to me , Pierre , and how much it will yet be to you , I hope ; I think we must very heartily forgive cousin Ralph , for what he then did . " " Yes , I think we must indeed , " chimed in little Pierre , now eagerly eying the very portrait in question , which hung over the mantel . " Well , by catching your father two or three times more in that way , cousin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all framed , and every way completed , he would have surprised your father by hanging it boldly up in his room among his other portraits , had not your father one morning suddenly  | come to him  --  while , indeed , the very picture itself was placed face down on a table and cousin Ralph fixing the cord to it ? came to him , and frightened cousin Ralph by quietly saying , that now that he thought of it , it seemed to him that cousin Ralph had been playing tricks with him ; but he hoped it was not so . What do you mean ? ' said cousin Ralph , a little flurried . You have not been hanging my portrait up here , have you , cousin Ralph ? ' said your father , glancing along the walls . I 'm glad I do n't see it . It is my whim , cousin Ralph , ? and perhaps it is a very silly one , ? but if you have been lately painting my portrait , I want you to destroy it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , keep it out of sight . What 's that you have there , cousin Ralph ? ' " Cousin Ralph was now more and more fluttered ; not knowing what to make  --  as indeed , to this day , I do n't completely myself  --  of your father 's strange manner . But he rallied , and said ? ' This , cousin Pierre , is a secret portrait I have here ; you must be aware that we portrait-painters are sometimes called upon to paint such . I , therefore , can not show it to you , or tell you any thing about it . ' " Have you been painting my portrait or not , cousin Ralph ? ' said your father , very suddenly and pointedly . have painted nothing that looks as you there look , ' said cousin Ralph , evasively , observing in your father 's face a fiercelike expression , which he had never seen there before . And more than that , your father could not get from him . " " And what then ? " said little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only your father never so much as caught one glimpse of that picture ; indeed , never knew for certain , whether there was such a painting in the world . Cousin Ralph secretly gave it to me , knowing how tenderly I loved your father ; making me solemnly promise never to expose it anywhere where your father could ever see it , or any way hear of it . This promise I faithfully kept ; and it was only after your clear father 's death , that I hung it in my chamber . There , Pierre , you now have the story of the chair-portrait . " " And a very strange one it is , " said Pierre ? " and so interesting , I shall never forget it , aunt . "  | " I hope you never will , my child . Now ring the bell , and we will have a little fruit-cake , and I will take a glass of wine , Pierre ; ? do you hear , my child ? ? the bell  --  ring it . Why , what do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't papa want to have cousin Ralph paint his picture , aunt ? " " How these children 's minds do run ! " exclaimed old Aunt Dorothea staring at little Pierre in amazement ? " That indeed is more than I can tell you , little Pierre . But cousin Ralph had a foolish fancy about it . He used to tell me , that being in your father 's room some few clays after the last scene I described , he noticed there a very wonderful work on Physiognomy , as they call it , in which the strangest and shadowiest rules were laid down for detecting people 's innermost secrets by studying their faces . And so , foolish cousin Ralph always flattered himself , that the reason your father did not want his portrait taken was , because he was secretly iu love with the French young lady , and did not want his secret published in a portrait ; since the wonderful work on Physiognomy had , as it were , indirectly warned him against running that risk . But cousin Ralph being such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had such curious whimsies about things . For my part , I do n't believe your father ever had any such ridiculous ideas on the subject . To be sure , I myself can not tell you why he did not want his picture taken ; but when you get to be as old as I am , little Pierre , you will find that every one , even the best of us , at times , is apt to act very queerly and unaccountably ; indeed some things we do , we can not entirely explain the reason of , even to ourselves , little Pierre . But you will know all about these strange matters by-and-by . " " I hope I shall , aunt , " said little Pierre. ? " But , dear aunt , I thought Marten was to bring in some fruit-cake ? " " Ring the bell for him , then , my child . " " Oh ! I forgot , " said little Pierre , doing her bidding . By-and-by , while the aunt was sipping her wine ; and the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the portrait in question ; little Pierre , pushing his stool nearer the picture exclaimed ? " Now , aunt , did papa really look exactly like that ?  | Did you ever see him in that same buff vest , and huge-figured neckcloth ? I remember the seal and key , pretty well ; and it was only a week ago that I saw mamma take them out of a little locked drawer in her wardrobe  --  but I do n't remember the queer whiskers ; nor the buff vest ; nor the huge white-figured neckcloth ; did you ever see papa in that very neckcloth , aunt ? " " My child , it was I that chose the stuff for that neckcloth ; yes , and hemmed it for him , and worked P.G . in one corner ; but that ai n't in the picture . It is an excellent likeness , my child , neckcloth and all ; as he looked at that time . Why , little Pierre , sometimes I sit here all alone by myself , gazing , and gazing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your father is looking at me , and smiling at me , and nodding at me , and saying  --  Dorothea ! Dorothea ! " " How strange , " said little Pierre , " I think it begins to look at inc now , aunt . Hark ! aunt , it 's so silent all round in this oldfashioned room , that I think I hear a little jingling in the picture , as if the watch-seal was striking against the key  --  Hark ! aunt . " " Bless me , do n't talk so strangely , my child . " " I heard mamma say once  --  but she did not say so to me ? that , for her part , she did not like Aunt Dorothea 's picture ; it was not a good likeness , so she said . Why do n't mamma like the picture , aunt ? " " My child , you ask very queer questions . If your mamma do n't like the picture , it is for a very plain reason . She has a much larger and finer one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , and paid I do n't know how many hundred dollars for it ; and that , too , is an excellent likeness , that must be the reason , little Pierre . " And thus the old aunt and the little child ran on ; each thinking the other very strange ; and both thinking the picture still stranger ; and the face in the picture still looked at them frankly , and cheerfully , as if there was nothing kept concealed ; and yet again , a little ambiguously and mockingly , as if slyly winking to some other picture , to mark what a very foolish old sister , and what a very silly little son , were growing so monstrously grave and speculative about a huge white-figured neckcloth , a buff vest , and a very gentleman-like and amiable countenance .  | And so , after this scene , as usual , one by one , the fleet years ran on ; till the little child Pierre had grown up to be the tall Master Pierre , and could call the picture his own ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could stand , or lean , or sit before it all day long , if he pleased , and keep thinking , and thinking , and thinking , and thinking , till by-and-by all thoughts were blurred , and at last there were no thoughts at all . Before the picture was sent to him , in his fifteenth year , it had been only through the inadvertence of his mother , or rather through a casual passing into a parlor by Pierre , that he had any way learned that his mother did not approve of the picture . Because , as then Pierre was still young , and the picture was the picture of his father , and the cherished property of a most excellent , and dearly-beloved , affectionate aunt ; therefore the mother , with an intuitive delicacy , had refrained from knowingly expressing her peculiar opinion in the presence of little Pierre . And this judicious , though half-unconscious delicacy in the mother , had been perhaps somewhat singularly answered by a like nicety of sentiment in the child ; for children of a naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wonderful , and often undreamed-of daintiness of propriety , and thoughtfulness , and forbearance , in matters esteemed a little subtile even by their elders , and self-elected betters . The little Pierre never disclosed to his mother that he had , through another person , become aware of her thoughts concerning Aunt Dorothea 's portrait ; he seemed to possess an intuitive knowledge of the circumstance , that from the difference of their relationship to his father , and for other minute reasons , he could in some things , with the greater propriety , be more inquisitive concerning him , with his aunt , than with his mother , especially touching the matter of the chair-portrait . And Aunt Dorothea 's reasons accounting for his mother 's distaste , long continued satisfactory , or at least not unsufficiently explanatory . And when the portrait arrived at the Meadows , it so chanced that his mother was abroad ; and so Pierre silently hung it up in his closet ; and when after a day or two his mother returned , he said nothing to her about its arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystery which invested it , and whose sacredness now he was fearful of violating , by provoking any discussion with his mother about Aunt Dorothea 's gift , or by pernutting himself to be improperly curious concerning the reasons of his mother 's private and self-reserved opinions of it . But the first time  --  and it was not long after the arrival of the portrait ? that he knew of his mother 's having entered his closet ; then , when he next saw her , he was prepared to hear what she should voluntarily say about the late addition to its embellishments ; but as she omitted all mention of any thing of that sort , he unobtrusively scanned her countenance , to mark whether any little clouding emotion might be discoverable there . But he could discern none . And as all genuine delicacies are by their nature accumulative ; therefore this reverential , mutual , but only tacit forbearance of the mother and son , ever after continued uninvaded . And it was another sweet , and sanctified , and sanctifying bond between them . For , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always abhor a secret , as nature is said to abhor a vacuum . Love is built upon secrets , as lovely Venice upon invisible and incorruptible piles in the sea . Love 's secrets , being mysteries , ever pertain to the transcendent and the infinite ; and so they are as airy bridges , by which our further shadows pass over into the regions of the golden mists and exhalations ; whence all poetical , lovely thoughts are engendered , and drop into us , as though pearls should drop from rainbows . As time went on , the chasteness and pure virginity of this mutual reservation , only served to dress the portrait in sweeter , because still more mysterious attractions ; and to fling , as it were , fresh fennel and rosemary around the revered memory of the lather . Though , indeed , as previously recounted , Pierre now and then loved to present to himself for some fanciful solution the penultimate secret of the portrait , in so far as that involved his mother 's distaste ; yet the cunning analysis in which such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sacred limit , where his mother 's peculiar repugnance began to shade off into ambiguous considerations , touching any unknown possibilities in the character and early life of the original . Not , that he had altogether forbidden his fancy to  | range in such fields of speculation ; but all such imaginings must be contributory to that pure , exalted idea of his father , which , in his soul , was based upon the known acknowledged facts of his father 's life , If , when the mind roams up and down in the ever-elastic regions of evanescent invention , any definite form or feature can be assigned to the multitudinous shapes it creates out of the incessant dissolvings of its own prior creations ; then might we here attempt to hold and define the least shadowy of those reasons , which about the period of adolescence we now treat of , more frequently occurred to Pierre , whenever he essayed to account for his mother 's remarkable distaste for the portrait . Yet will we venture one sketch . Yes  --  sometimes dimly thought Pierre  --  who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been not so very far from the truth , when he surmised that at one time my father did indeed cherish some passing emotion for the beautiful young Frenchwoman . And this portrait being painted at that precise time , and indeed with the precise purpose of perpetuating some shadowy testification of the fact in the countenance of the original : therefore , its expression is not congenial , is not familiar , is not altogether agreeable to my mother : because , not only did my father 's features never look so to her ( since it was afterward that she first became acquainted with him ) , but also , that certain womanliness of women ; that thing I should perhaps call a tender jealousy , a fastidious vanity , in any other lady , enables her to perceive that the glance of the face in the portrait , is not , in some nameless way , dedicated to herself , but to some other and unknown object ; and therefore , is she impatient of it , and it is repelling to her ; for she must naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is not in some way connected with her own recollections of him . Whereas , the larger and more expansive portrait in the great drawing-room , taken in the prime of life ; during the best and rosiest days of their wedded union ; at the particular desire of my mother ; and by a celebrated artist of her own election , and  | costumed after her own taste ; and on all hands considered to be , by those who know , a singularly happy likeness at the period ; a belief spiritually reinforced by my own dim infantile remembrances ; for all these reasons , this drawing-room portrait possesses an inestimable charm to her ; there , she indeed beholds her husband as he had really appeared to her ; she does not vacantly gaze upon an unfamiliar phantom called up from the distant , and , to her , well-nigh fabulous days of my father 's bachelor life . But in that other portrait , she sees rehearsed to her fond eyes , the latter tales and legends of his devoted wedded love . Yes , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And yet , ever new conceits come vaporing up in me , as I look on the strange chair-portrait : which , though so very much more unfamiliar to me , than it can possibly be to my mother , still sometimes seems to say  --  Pierre , believe not the drawing-room painting ; that is not thy father ; or , at least , is not all of thy father . Consider in thy mind , Pierre , whether we two paintings may not make only one . Faithful wives are ever over-fond to a certain imaginary image of their husbands ; and faithful widows are ever over-reverential to a certain imagined ghost of that same imagined image , Pierre . Look again , I am thy father as he more truly was . In mature life , the world overlays and varnishes us , Pierre ; the thousand proprieties and polished finenesses and grimaces intervene , Pierre ; then , we , as it were , abdicate ourselves , and take unto us another self , Pierre ; in youth we are , Pierre , but in age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , so much the more truly , as thou thinkest thou recognizest me not , Pierre . To their young children , fathers are not wont to unfold themselves entirely , Pierre . There are a thousand and one odd little youthful peccadilloes , that we think we may as well not divulge to them , Pierre . Consider this strange , ambiguous smile , Pierre ; more narrowly regard this mouth . Behold , what is this too ardent and , as it were , unchastened light in these eyes , Pierre ? I am thy father , boy . There was once a certain , oh , but too lovely young Frenchwoman , Pierre . Youth is hot , and t niptation strong , Pierre ; and in the minutest moment momentous things are irrevocably done , Pierre ; and Time sweeps on , : mid the thing is not always carried down by its stream , but may  | be left stranded on its bank ; away beyond , in the young , green countries , Pierre . Look again . Doth thy mother dislike me for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loving impressions , ever strive to magnify , and spiritualize , and deify , her husband 's memory , Pierre ? Then why doth she cast despite upon me ; and never speak to thee of me ; and why dost thou thyself keep silence before her , Pierre ? Consider . Is there no little mystery here ? Probe a little , Pierre . Never fear , never fear . No matter for thy father now . Look , do I not smile ? ? yes , and with an unchangeable smile ; and thus have I unchangeably smiled for many long years gone by , Pierre . Oh , it is a permanent smile ! Thus I smiled to cousin Ralph ; and thus in thy dear old Aunt Dorothea 's parlor , Pierre ; and just so , I smile here to thee , and even thus in thy father 's later life , when his body may have been in grief , still  --  hidden away in Aunt Dorothea 's secretary  --  I thus smiled as before ; and just so I 'd smile were I now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pierre ; though suspended in outer darkness , still would I smile with this smile , though then not a soul should he near . Consider ; for a smile is j ? the chosen vehicle of all ambiguities , Pierre . When we would deceive , we smile ; when we are hatching any nice little artifice , Pierre ; only just a little gratifying our own sweet little appetites , Pierre ; then watch us , and out comes the odd little smile . Once upon a time , there was a lovely young Frenchwoman , Pierre . Have you carefully , and analytically , and psychologically , and metaphysically , considered her belongings and surroundings , and all her incidentals , Pierre ? Oh , a strange sort of story , that , thy dear old Aunt Dorothea once told thee , Pierre . I once knew a credulous old soul , Pierre . Probe , probe a little  --  see  --  there seems one little crack there , Pierre  --  a wedge , a wedge . Something ever comes of all persistent inquiry ; we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for nothing , do we so intrigue and become wily diplomatists , and glozers with our own minds , Pierre ; and afraid of following the Indian trail from the open plain into the dark thickets , Pierre ; but enough ; a word to the wise . Thus sometimes in the mystical , outer quietude of the long country nights ; either when the hushed mansion was banked  | round by the thick-fallen December snows , or banked round by the immovable white August moonlight ; in the haunted repose of a wide story , tenanted only by himself ; and sentineling his own little closet ; and standing guard , as it were , before the mystical tent of the picture ; and ever watching the strangely concealed lights of the meanings that so mysteriously moved to and fro within ; thus sometimes stood Pierre before the portrait of his father , unconsciously throwing himself open to all those ineffable hints and ambiguities , and undefined half-suggestions , which now and then people the soul 's atmosphere , as thickly as in a soft , steady snow-storm , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these reveries and trances , Pierre would regain the assured element of consciously bidden and self-propelled thought ; and then in a moment the air all cleared , not a snow-flake descended , and Pierre , upbraiding himself for his self-indulgent infatuation , would promise never again to fall into a midnight revery before the chair-portrait of his father . Nor did the streams of these reveries seem to leave any conscious sediment in his mind ; they were so light and so rapid , that they rolled their own alluvial along ; and seemed to leave all Pierre 's thought-channels as clean and dry as though never any alluvial stream had rolled there at all . And so still in his sober , cherishing memories , his father 's beatification remained untouched ; and all the strangeness of X the portrait only served to invest his idea with a fine , legendary romance ; the essence whereof was that very mystery , which at other times was so subtly and evilly significant . But now , now ! ? Isabel 's letter read : swift as the first light that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all mysteries ripped open as if with a keen sword and , forth trooped thickening phantoms of an infinite gloom . Now his remotest infantile reminiscences  --  the wandering mind of his father  --  the empty hand , and the ashen  --  the strange story of Aunt Dorothea  --  the mystical midnight suggestions of the portrait itself ; and , above all , his mother 's intuitive aversion , all , all overwhelmed him with reciprocal testimonies . And now , by irresistible intuitions , all that had been inexplicably mysterious to him in the portrait , and all that had been  | inexplicably familiar in the face , most magically these now coincided ; the merriness of the one not inharmonious with the mournfulness of the other , but by some ineffable correlativeness , they reciprocally identified each other , and , as it were , melted into each other , and thus interpenetratingly uniting , presented lineaments of an added supernaturalness . On all sides , the physical world of solid objects now slidingly displaced itself from around him , and he floated into an ether of visions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and outstaring eyes at the transfixed face in the air , he ejaculated that wonderful verse from Dante , descriptive of the two mutually absorbing shapes in the Inferno : " Ah ! how dost thou change , Agnello ! See ! thou art not double now , Nor only one ! "  | IT WAS long after midnight when Pierre returned to the house . He had rushed forth in that complete abandonment of soul , which , in so ardent a temperament , attends the first stages of any sudden and tremendous affliction ; but now he returned in pallid composure , for the calm spirit of the night , and the then risen moon , and the late revealed stars , had all at last become as a strange subduing melody to him , which , though at first trampled and scorned , yet by degrees had stolen into the windings of his heart , and so shed abroad its own quietude in him . Now , from his height of composure , he firmly gazed abroad upon the charred landscape within him ; as the timber man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his forests , comes back again when the fires have waned , and unblinkingly eyes the immeasurable fields of fire-brands that here and there glow beneath the wide canopy of smoke . It has been said , that always when Pierre would seek solitude in its material shelter and walled isolation , then the closet communicating with his chamber was his elected haunt . So , going to his room , he took up the now dim-burning lamp he had left there , and instinctively entered that retreat , seating himself , with folded arms and bowed head , in the accustomed dragonfooted old chair . With leaden feet , and heart now changing from iciness to a strange sort of indifference , and a numbing sensation stealing over him , he sat there awhile , till , like the resting traveler in snows , he began to struggle against this inertness as the most treacherous and deadliest of symptoms . He  | looked up , and found himself fronted by the no longer wholly enigmatical , but still ambiguously smiling picture of his father . Instantly all his consciousness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grim tranquillity which possessed him . Yet endure the smiling portrait he could not ; and obeying an irresistible nameless impulse , he rose , and without unhanging it , reversed the picture on the wall . This brought to sight the defaced and dusty back , with some wrinkled , tattered paper over the joints , which had become loosened from the paste . " Oh , symbol of thy reversed idea in my soul , " groaned Pierre ; " thou shalt not hang thus . Rather cast thee utterly out , than conspicuously insult thee so . I will no more have a father . " He removed the picture wholly from the wall , and the closet ; and concealed it in a large chest , covered with blue chintz , and locked it up there . But still , in a square space of slightly discolored wall , the picture still left its shadowy , but vacant and desolate trace . He now strove to banish the least trace of his altered father , as fearful that at present all thoughts concerning him were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incapacitating to a mind , which was now loudly called upon , not only to endure a signal grief , but immediately to act upon it . Wild and cruel case , youth ever thinks ; but mistakenly ; for Experience well knows , that action , though it seems an aggravation of woe , is really an alleviative ; though permanently to alleviate pain , we must first dart some added pangs . Nor now , though profoundly sensible that his whole previous moral being was overturned , and that for him the fair structure of the world must , in some then unknown way , be entirely rebuilded again , from the lowermost corner stone up ; nor now did Pierre torment himself with the thought of that last desolation ; and how the desolate place was to be made flourishing again . He seemed to feel that in his deepest soul , lurked an indefinite but potential faith , which could rule in the interregnum of all hereditary beliefs , and circumstantial persuasions ; not wholly , he felt , was his soul in anarchy . The indefinite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pierre was not entirely given up to his grief 's utter pillage and sack .  | To a less enthusiastic heart than Pierre 's the foremost question in respect to Isabel which would have presented itself , would have been , What must I do ? But such a question never presented itself to Pierre ; the spontaneous responsiveness of his being left no shadow of dubiousness as to the direct point he must aim at . But if the object was plain , not so the path to it . How must I do it ? was a problem for which at first there seemed no chance of solution . But without being entirely aware of it himself , Pierre was one of those spirits , which not in a determinate and sordid scrutiny of small pros and cons  --  but in an impulsive subservience to the god-like dictation of events themselves , find at length the surest solution of perplexities , and the brightest prerogative of command . And as for him , What must I do ? was a question already answered by the inspiration of the difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconsciously discharged his mind , for the present , of all distracting considerations concerning How he should do it ; assured that the coming interview with Isabel could not but unerringly inspire him there . Still , the inspiration which had thus far directed him had not been entirely mute and undivulging as to many very bitter things which Pierre foresaw in the wide sea of trouble into which he was plunged . If it be the sacred province and  --  by the wisest , deemed ? the inestimable compensation of the heavier woes , that they both purge the soul of gay-hearted errors and replenish it with a saddened truth ; that holy office is not so much accomplished by any covertly inductive reasoning process , whose original motive is received from the particular affliction ; as it is the magical effect of the admission into man 's inmost spirit of a before unexperienced and wholly inexplicable element , which like electricity suddenly received into any sultry atmosphere of the dark , in all directions splits itself into nimble lances of purifying light ; which at one and the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an illuminating property ; so that objects which before , in the uncertainty of the dark , assumed shadowy and romantic outlines , now are lighted up in their substantial realities ; so that in these flashing revelations of grief 's wonderful fire , we see all things as they are ; and though , when  | the electric element is gone , the shadows once more descend , and the false outlines of objects again return ; yet not with their former power to deceive ; for now , even in the presence of the falsest aspects , we still retain the impressions of their immovable true ones , though , indeed , once more concealed . Thus with Pierre . In the joyous young times , ere his great grief came upon him , all the objects which surrounded him were concealingly deceptive . Not only was the long-cherished image of his father now transfigured before him from a green foliaged tree into a blasted trunk , but every other image in his mind attested the universality of that electral light which had darted into his soul . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untouched , unaltered by the shock . At her changed aspect , when first revealed to him , Pierre had gazed in a panic ; and now , when the electrical storm had gone by , he retained in his mind , that so suddenly revealed image , with an infinite mournfulness . She , who in her less splendid but finer and more spiritual part , had ever seemed to Pierre not only as a beautiful saint before whom to offer up his daily orisons , but also as a gentle lady-counsellor and confessor , and her revered chamber as a soft satin-hung cabinet and confessional ; ? his mother was no longer this all-alluring thing ; no more , he too keenly felt , could he go to his mother , as to one who entirely sympathized with him ; as to one before whom he could almost unreservedly unbosom himself ; as to one capable of pointing out to him the true path where he seemed most beset . Wonderful , indeed , was the electric insight which Fate had now given him into the vital character of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests ; but when Pierre thought of the touchstone of his immense strait applied to her spirit ; he felt profoundly assured that she would crumble into nothing before it . She was a noble creature , but formed chiefly for the gilded prosperities of life , and hitherto mostly used to its unruffled serenities ; bred and expanded , in all developments , under the sole influence of hereditary forms and world-usages . Not his refined , courtly , loving , equable mother , Pierre felt , could unreservedly , and like a heaven 's heroine , meet the shock of his extraordinary emergency , and applaud , to his heart 's echo , a  | sublime resolve , whose execution should call down the astonishmeent and the jeers of the world . My mother ! ? dearest mother ! ? God bath given me a sister , and unto thee a daughter , and covered her with the world 's extremest infamy and scorn , that so I and thou  --  thou , my mother , mightest gloriously own her , and acknowledge her , acid , ? Nay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could such syllables be one instant tolerated by her . Then , high-up , and tow ( ring , and all-forbidding before Pierre grew the before unthought-of wonderful edifice of his mother 's immense pride ; ? her pride of birth , her pride of affluence , her pride of purity , and all the pride of high-born , refined , and wealthy Life , and all the Semiramian pride of woman . Then he staggered back upon himself , and only found support in himself . Then Pierre felt that deep in him lurked a divine unidentifiableness , that owned no earthly kith or kin . Yet was this feeling entirely lonesome , and orphan-like . Fain , then , for one moment , would he have recalled the thousand sweet illusions of Life ; tho ' purchased at the price of Life 's Truth ; so that once more he might not feel himself driven out an infant Ishmael into the desert , with no maternal Hagar to accompany and comfort him . Still , were these emotions without prejudice to his own love for his mother , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all , there was no shallow disdain toward her of superior virtue . He too plainly saw , that not his mother had made his mother ; but the Infinite Haughtiness had first fashioned her ; and then the haughty world had further molded her ; nor had a haughty Ritual omitted to finish her . Wonderful , indeed , we repeat it , was the electrical insight which Pierre now had into the character of his mother , for not even the vivid recalling of her lavish love for him could suffice to gainsay his sudden persuasion . Love me she doth , thought Pierre , but how ? Loveth she me with the love past all understanding ? that love , which in the loved one 's behalf , would still calmly confront all hate ? whose most triumphing hymn , triumphs only by swelling above all opposing taunts and despite ?  --  - Loving mother , here have I a loved , but world-infamous sister to own ; ? and if thou lovest me , mother , thy love will love her ,  | too , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the hand. ? And as Pierre thus in fancy led Isabel before his mother ; and in fancy led her away , and felt his tongue cleave to the roof of his mouth , with her transfixing look of inoredulous , scornful horror ; then Pierre 's enthusiastic heart sunk in and in , and caved clean away in him , as he so poignantly felt his first feeling of the dreary heart-vacancies of the conventional life . Oh heartless , proud , ice-gilded world , how I hate thee , he thought , that thy tyrannous , insatiate grasp , thus now in my bitterest need  --  thus doth rob me even of my mother ; thus doth make me now doubly an orphan , without a green grave to bedew . My tears , ? could I weep them , must now be wept in the desolate places ; now to me is it , as though both father and mother had gone on distant voyages , and , returning , died in unknown seas . She loveth me , ay ; ? but why ? Had I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Now , do I remember that in her most caressing love , there ever gleamed some scaly , glittering folds of pride . Me she loveth with pride 's love ; in me she thinks she seeth her own curled and haughty beauty ; before my glass she stands , ? pride 's priestess  --  and to her mirrored image , not to me , she offers up her offerings of kisses . Oh , small thanks I owe thee , Favorable Goddess , that didst clothe this form with all the beauty of a man , that so thou mightest hide from me all the truth of a man . Now I see that in his beauty a man is snared , and made stone-blind , as the worm within its silk . Welcome then be Ugliness and Poverty and Infamy , and all ye other crafty ministers of Truth , that beneath the hoods and rags of beggars hide yet the belts and crowns of kings . And dimmed be all beauty that must own the clay ; and dimmed be all wealth , and all delight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gild the links , and stud with diamonds the base rivets and the chains of Lies . Oh , now methinks I a little see why of old the men of Truth went barefoot , girded with a rope , and ever moving under mournfulness as underneath a canopy . I remember now those first wise words , wherewith our Saviour Christ first spoke in his first speech to men : ? ' Blessed are the poor in spirit , and blessed they that mourn . ' Oh , hitherto I have but  | piled up words ; bought books , and bought some small experiences , and builded me in libraries ; now I sit down and read . Oh , now I know the night , and comprehend the sorceries of the moon , and all the dark persuadings that have their birth in storms and winds . Oh , not long will Joy abide , when Truth doth come ; nor Grief her laggard be . Well may this head hang on my breast , ? it holds too much ; well may my heart knock at my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , men are jailers all ; jailers of themselves ; and in Opinion 's world ignorantly hold their noblest part a captive to their vilest ; as disguised royal Charles when caught by peasants . The heart ! the heart ! ' t is God 's anointed ; let me pursue the heart ! But if the presentiment in Pierre of his mother 's pride , as bigotedly hostile to the noble design he cherished ; if this feeling was so wretched to him ; far more so was the thought of another and a deeper hostility , arising from her more spiritual part . For her pride would not be so scornful , as her wedded memories reject with horror , the unmentionable imputation involved in the mere fact of Isabel 's existence . In what galleries of conjecture , among what horrible haunting toads and scorpions , would such a revelation lead her ? When Pierre thought of this , the idea of at all divulging his secret to his mother , not only was made repelling by its hopelessness , as an infirm attack upon her citadel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhuman , as torturing her in her tenderest recollections , and desecrating the whitest altar in her sanctuary . Though the conviction that he must never disclose his secret to his mother was originally an unmeditated , and as it were , an inspired one ; yet now he was almost pains-taking in scrutinizing the entire circumstances of the matter , in order that nothing Wright be overlooked . For already he vaguely felt , that upon the concealment , or the disclosure of this thing , with reference to his mother , hinged his whole future course of conduct , his whole earthly weal , and Isabel 's . But the more and the more that he pondered upon it , the more and the more fixed became his original conviction . He considered that in the case of a dis-  | closure , all human probability pointed to his mother 's scornful rejection of his suit as a pleader for Isabel 's honorable admission into the honorable mansion of the Glendinnings . Then in that case , unconsciously thought Pierre , I shall have given the deep poison of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any , and positive harm to all . And through Pierre 's mind there then darted a baleful thought ; how that the truth should not always be paraded ; how that sometimes a lie is heavenly , and truth infernal . Filially infernal , truly , thought Pierre , if I should by one vile breath of truth , blast my father 's blessed memory in the bosom of my mother , and plant the sharpest dagger of grief in her soul . I will not do it ! But as this resolution in him opened up so dark and wretched a background to his view , he strove to think no more of it now , but postpone it until the interview with Isabel should have in some way more definitely shaped his purposes . For , when suddenly encountering the shock of new and unanswerable revelations , which he feels must revolutionize all the circumstances of his life , man , at first , ever seeks to shun all conscious definitiveness in his thoughts and purposes ; as assured , that the lines that shall precisely define his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; these can only be defined by sharp stakes that cut into his heart . Most melancholy of all the hours of earth , is that one long , gray hour , which to the watcher by the lamp intervenes between the night and day ; when both lamp and watcher , overtasked , grow sickly in the pallid light ; and the watcher , seeking for no gladness in the dawn , sees naught but garish vapors there ; and almost invokes a curse upon the public day , that shall invade his lonely night of sufferance . The one small window of his closet looked forth upon the meadow , and across the river , and far away to the distant heights , storied with the great deeds of the Glendinnings . Many a time had Pierre sought this window before sunrise , to behold the blood-red , out-flinging dawn , that would wrap those purple hills as with a banner . But now the morning dawned in mist  | and rain , and came drizzlingly upon his heart . Yet as the day advanced , and once more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that natural light , which , till this very moment , had never lighted him but to his joy ; now that the day , and not the night , was witness to his woe ; now first the dread reality came appallingly upon him . A sense of horrible forlornness , feebleness , impotence , and infinite , eternal desolation possessed him . It was not merely mental , but corporeal also . He could not stand ; and when he tried to sit , his arms fell floorwards as tied to leaden weights . Dragging his ball and chain , he fell upon his bed ; for when the mind is cast down , only in sympathetic proneness can the body rest ; whence the bed is often Grief 's first refuge . Half stupefied , as with opium , he fell into the profoundest sleep . In an hour he awoke , instantly recalling all the previous night ; and now finding himself a little strengthened , and lying so quietly and silently there , almost without bodily consciousness , but his soul unobtrusively alert ; careful not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limb , or the least turning of his head , Pierre steadfastly faced his grief , and looked deep clown into its eyes ; and thoroughly , and calmly , and summarily comprehended it now  --  so at least he thought  --  and what it demanded from him ; and what he must quickly do in its more immediate sequences ; and what that course of conduct was , which he must pursue in the coming unevadable breakfast interview with his mother ; and what , for the present must be his plan with Lucy . His time of thought was brief . Rising from his hed , he steadied himself upright a moment ; and then going to his writing-desk , in a few at first faltering , but at length unlagging lines , traced the following note : " I must ask pardon of you , Lucy , for so strangely absenting myself last night . But you know me well enough to be very sure that I would not have done so without important cause . I was in the street approaching your cottage , when a message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter which will take up all my time and attention for , possibly , two or three days . I tell you this , now , that you maybe prepared for it . And I know  | that however unwelcome this may be to you , you will yet bear with it for my sake ; for , indeed , and indeed , Lucy dear , I would not dream of staying from you so long , unless irresistibly coerced to it . Do not come to the mansion until I come to you ; and do not manifest any curiosity or anxiety about me , should you chance in the interval to see my mother in any other place . Keep just as cheerful as if I were by you all the time . Do this , now , I conjure you ; and so farewell ! " He folded the note , and was about sealing it , when he hesitated a moment , and instantly unfolding it , read it to himself . But he could not adequately comprehend his own writing , for a sudden cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pen hurriedly again , he added the following postscript : " Lucy , this note may seem mysterious ; but if it shall , I did not mean to make it so ; nor do I know that I could have helped it . But the only reason is this , Lucy : the matter which I have alluded to , is of such a nature , that , for the present I stand virtually pledged not to disclose it to any person but those more directly involved in it . But where one can not reveal the thing itself , it only makes it the more mysterious to write round it this way . So merely know me entirely unmenaced in person , and eternally faithful to you ; and so be at rest till I see you . " Then sealing the note , and ringing the bell , he gave it in strict charge to a servant , with directions to deliver it at the earliest practicable moment , and not wait for any answer . But as the messenger was departing the chamber he called him back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in his hand , scrawled inside of it in pencil the following words : " Do n't write me ; do n't inquire for me " ; and then returned it to the man , who quitted him , leaving Pierre rooted in thought in the middle of the room . But he soon roused himself , and left the mansion ; and seeking the cool , refreshing meadow stream , where it formed a deep and shady pool , he bathed ; and returning invigorated to his chamber , changed his entire dress ; in the little trifling concern-  | merits of his toilet , striving utterly to banish all thought of that weight upon his soul . Never did he array himself with more solicitude for effect . It was one of his fond mother 's whims to perfume the lighter contents of his wardrobe ; and it was one of his own little femininenesses  --  of the sort sometimes curiously observable in very robust-bodied and big-souled men , as Mohammed , for example  --  to be very partial to all pleasant essences . So that when once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheek anew to meet the keen glance of his mother ? to whom the secret of his possible pallor could not be divulged ; Pierre went forth all redolent ; but alas ! his body only the embalming cerements of his buried dead within . His stroll was longer than he meant ; and when he returned up the Linden Walk leading to the breakfast-room , and ascended the piazza steps , and glanced into the wide window there , he saw his mother seated not far from the table ; her face turned toward his own ; and heard her gay voice , and peculiarly light and buoyant laugh , accusing him , and not her , of being the morning 's laggard now . Dates was busy among some spoons and napkins at a side-stand . Summoning all possible cheerfulness to his face , Pierre entered the room . Remembering his ? carefulness in bathing and dressing ; and knowing that there is no air so calculated to give bloom to the cheek as that of a damply fresh , cool , and misty morning , Pierre persuaded himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his long night of watching . " Good morning sister ; ? such a famous stroll ! I have been all the way to " " Where ? good heavens ! where ? for such a look as that ! ? why , Pierre , Pierre ? what ails thee ? Dates , I will touch the bell presently. , ' As the good servitor fumbled for a moment among the napkins , as if unwilling to stir so summarily from his accustomed duty , and not without some of a well and long-tried old domestic 's vague , intermitted murmuring , at being wholly excluded from a matter of family interest ; Mrs. Glendinning kept her  | fixed eye on Pierre , who , unmindful that the breakfast was not yet entirely ready , seating himself at the table , began helping himself  --  though but nervously enough  --  to the cream and sugar . The moment the door closed on Dates , the mother sprang to her feet , and threw her arms around her son ; but in that embrace , Pierre miserably felt that their two hearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What haggard thing possesses thee , my son ? Speak , this is incomprehensible ! Lucy ; ? fie ! ? not she ? ? no love-quarrel there ; ? speak , speak , my darling boy ! " " My dear sister , " began Pierre . " Sister me not , now , Pierre ; ? I am thy mother . " " Well , then , dear mother , thou art quite as incomprehensible to me as I to " " Talk faster , Pierre  --  this calmness freezes me . Tell me ; for , by my soul , something most wonderful must have happened to thee . Thou art my son , and I command thee . It is not Lucy ; it is something else . Tell me . " " My dear mother , " said Pierre , impulsively moving his chair backward from the table , " if thou wouldst only believe me when I say it , I have really nothing to tell thee . Thou knowest that sometimes , when I happen to feel very foolishly studious and philosophical , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regardless of the hour , foolishly run out into the air , for a long stroll across the meadows . I took such a stroll last night ; and had but little time left for napping afterward ; and what nap I had I was none the better for . But I wo n't be so silly again , soon ; so do , dearest mother , stop looking at me , and let us to breakfast. ? Dates ! Touch the bell there , sister . " " Stay , Pierre ! ? There is a heaviness in this hour . I feel , I know , that thou art deceiving me ; ? perhaps I erred in seeking to wrest thy secret from thee ; but believe me , my son , I never thought thou hadst any secret thing from me , except thy first love for Lucy  --  and that , my own womanhood tells me , was most pardonable and right . But now , what can it be ? Pierre , Pierre ! consider well before thou determinest upon withholding confidence from me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Can that be good and virtuous , Pierre , which shrinks from a  | mother 's knowledge ? Let us not loose hands so , Pierre ; thy confidence from me , mine goes from thee . Now , shall I touch the bell ? " Pierre , who had thus far been vainly seeking to occupy his hands with his cup and spoon ; he now paused , and unconsciously fastened a speechless glance of mournfulness upon his mother . Again he felt presentiments of his mother 's newly-revealed character . He foresaw the supposed indignation of her wounded pride ; her gradually estranged affections thereupon ; Ise knew her firmness , and her exaggerated ideas of the inalienable allegiance of a son . He trembled to think , that now indeed was come the first initial moment of his heavy trial . But though he knew all the significance of his mother 's attitude , as she stood before him , intently eying him , with one hand upon the bell-cord ; and though he felt that the same opening of the door that should now admit Dates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between him and his mother ; and though he felt , too , that this was his mother 's latent thought ; nevertheless , he was girded up in his well-considered resolution . " Pierre , Pierre ! shall I touch the bell ? " " Mother , stay ! ? yes do , sister . " The bell was rung ; and at the summons Dates entered ; and looking with some significance at Mrs. Glendinning , said , ? " His Reverence has come , my mistress , and is now in the west parlor . " " Show Mr. Falsgrave in here immediately ; and bring up the coffee ; did I not tell you I expected him to breakfast this morn-ing ? " " Yes , my mistress ; but I thought that  --  that  --  just then " ? glancing alarmedly from mother to son . " Oh , my good Dates , nothing has happened , " cried Mrs. Clendinning , lightly , and with a bitter smile , looking toward her son , ? " show Mr. Falsgrave in . Pierre , I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but Mr. Falsgrave breakfasts with us by invitation . I was at the parsonage yesterday , to see him about that wretched affair of Delly , and we are finally to settle upon what is to be done this morning . But my mind is made up concerning Ned ; no such profligate shall pollute this place ; nor shall the disgraceful Delly. "  | Fortunately , the abrupt entrance of the clergyman , here turned away attention from the sudden pallor of Pierre 's countenance , and afforded him time to rally . " Good morning , Madam ; good morning , sir , " said Mr. Falsgrave , in a singularly mild , flute-like voice , turning to Mrs. Glendinning and her son ; the lady receiving him with answering cordiality , but Pierre too embarrassed just then to be equally polite . As for one brief moment Mr. Falsgrave stood before the pair , ere taking the offered chair from Dates , his aspect was eminently attractive . There are certain ever-to-be-cherished moments in the life of almost any man , when a variety of little foregoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be hard and bitter in his life , and also to make him most amiably and ruddily disposed ; when the scene and company immediately before him are highly agreeable ; and if at such a time he chance involuntarily to put himself into a scenically favorable bodily posture ; then , iii that posture , however transient , thou shalt catch the noble stature of his Better Angel ; catch a heavenly glimpse of the latent heavenliness of man . It was so with Mr. Falsgrave now . Not a house within a circuit of fifty miles that he preferred entering before the mansionhouse of Saddle Meadows ; and though the business upon which he had that morning come , was any thing but relishable to him , yet that subject was not in his memory then . Before him stood united in one person , the most exalted lady and the most storied beauty of all the country round ; and the finest , most intellectual , and most congenial youth he knew . Before him also , stood the generous foundress and the untiring patroness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not four years gone by . Before him also , stood  --  though in polite disguise  --  the same untiring benefactress , from whose purse , he could not help suspecting , came a great part of his salary , nominally supplied by the rental of the pews . Ile had been invited to breakfast ; a meal , which , in a well-appointed country family , is the most cheerful circumstance of daily life ; he smelt all Java 's spices in the aroma from the silver coffee-urn ; and well he knew , what liquid deliciousness would soon come from it .  | Besides all this , and many more minutenesses of the kind , he was conscious that Mrs. Glendinning entertained a particular partiality for him ( though not enough to marry him , as he ten times knew by very bitter experience ) , and that Pierre was not behindhand in his esteem . And the clergyman was well worthy of it . Nature had been royally bountiful to him in his person . In his happier moments , as the present , his face was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person was nobly robust and dignified ; while the remarkable smallness of his feet , and the almost infantile delicacy , and vivid whiteness and purity of his hands , strikingly contrasted with his fine girth and stature . For in countries like America , where there is no distinct hereditary caste of gentlemen , whose order is factitiously perpetuated as race-horses and lords are in kingly lands ; and especially , in those agricultural districts , where , of a hundred hands , that drop a ballot for the Presidency , ninety-nine shall be of the brownest and the brawniest ; in such districts , this daintiness of the fingers , when united with a generally manly aspect , assumes a remarkableness unknown in European nations . This most prepossessing form of the clergyman lost nothing by the character of his manners , which were polished and unobtrusive , but peculiarly insinuating , without the least appearance of craftiness or affectation . Heaven had given him his fine , silver-keyed person for a flute to play on in this world ; and he was nearly the perfect master of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You almost thought you heard , not saw him . So much the wonderful , yet natural gentleman be seemed , that more than once Mrs. Glendinning had held him up to Pierre as a splendid example of the polishing and gentlemanizing influences of Christianity upon the mind and manners ; declaring , that extravagant as it might seem , she had always been of his father 's fancy , ? that no man could be a complete gentleman , and preside with dignity at his own table , unless he partook of the church 's sacraments . Nor in Mr. Falsgrave 's case was this maxim entirely absurd . The child of a poor northern farmer who had wedded a pretty sempstress , the clergyman had no heraldic line of ancestry to show , as warrant  | and explanation of his handsome person and gentle manners ; the first , being the willful partiality of nature ; and the second , the consequence of a scholastic life , attempered by a taste for the choicest female society , however small , which he had always regarded as the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his person , his mind answered to them both , and was their finest illustration . Besides his eloquent persuasiveness in the pulpit , various fugitive papers upon subjects of nature , art , and literature , attested not only his refined affinity to all beautiful things , visible or invisible ; but likewise that he possessed a genius for celebrating such things , which in a less indolent and more ambitious nature , would have been sure to have gained a fair poet 's name ere now . For this Mr. Falsgrave was just hovering upon his prime of years ; a period which , in such a man , is the sweetest , and , to a mature woman , by far the most attractive of manly life . Youth has not yet completely gone with its beauty , grace , and strength ; nor has age at all come with its decrepitudes ; though the finest undrossed parts of it  --  its mildness and its wisdom  --  have gone on before , as decorous chamberlains precede the sedan of some crutched king . Such was this Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , a corner of one of that lady 's generous napkins so inserted into his snowy bosom , that its folds almost invested him as far down as the table 's edge ; and he seemed a sacred priest , indeed , breakfasting in his surplice . " Pray , Mr. Falsgrave , " said Mrs. Glendinning , " break me off a bit of that roll . " Whether or not his sacerdotal experiences had strangely refined and spiritualized so simple a process as breaking bread ; or whether it was from the spotless aspect of his hands : certain it is that Mr. Falsgrave acquitted himself on this little occasion , in a manner that beheld of old by Leonardo , might have given that artist no despicable hint touching his celestial painting . As Pierre regarded him , sitting there so mild and meek ; such an image of white-browed and white-handed , and napkined immaculateness ; and as he felt the gentle humane radiations which came from the clergyman 's manly and rounded beauti-  | illness ; and as he remembered all the good that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had heard of him , and could recall no blemish in his character ; and as in his own concealed misery and forlornness , he contemplated the open benevolence , and beaming excellent-heartedness of Mr. Falsgrave , the thought darted through his mind , that if any living being was capable of giving him worthy counsel in his strait ; and if to anyone he could go with Christian propriety and some small hopefulness , that person was the one before him . " Pray , Mr. Glendinning , " said the clergyman , pleasantly , as Pierre was silently offering to help him to some tongue ? " do n't let me rob you of it  --  pardon me , but you seem to have very little yourself this morning , I think . An execrable pun , I know : brut " ? turning toward Mrs. Glendinning ? " when one is made to feel very happy , one is somehow apt to say very silly things . Happiness and silliness  --  ah , it 's a suspicious coincidence . " " Mr. Falsgrave , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? We were talking yesterday , Mr. Falsgrave , concerning that vile fellow , Ned . " " Well , Madam , " responded the gentleman , a very little uneasily . " Ile shall not stay on any ground of mine ; my mind is made up , sir . Infamous man ! ? did he not have a wife as virtuous and beautiful now , as when I first gave her away at your altar ? ? It was the sheerest and most gratuitous profligacy . " The clergyman mournfully and assentingly moved his head . " Such men , " continued the lady , flushing with the sincerest indignation ? " are to my way of thinking more detestable than murderers . " " That is being a little hard upon them , my dear Madam , " said Mr. Falsgrave , mildly . " Do you not think so , Pierre ? " ? now , said the lady , turning earnestly upon her son ? " is not the man , who has sinned like that Ned , worse than a murderer ? Has he not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  to both of diet n  --  for their portion . If his own legitimate boy should now h ; ite him , I could hardly blame him . "  | " My dear Madam , " said the clergyman , whose eyes having followed Mrs. Glendinning 's to her son 's countenance , and marking a strange trepidation there , had thus far been earnestly scrutinizing Pierre 's not wholly repressible emotion ; ? " My dear Madam , " he said , slightly bending over his stately episcopallooking person ? " Virtue has , perhaps , an over-ardent champion in you ; you grow too warm ; but Mr. Glendinning , here , he seems to grow too cold . Pray , favor us with your views , Mr. Glendinning . " " I will not think now of the man , " said Pierre , slowly , and looking away from both his auditors ? " let us speak of Delly and her infant  --  she has , or had one , I have loosely heard ; ? their case is miserable indeed . " " The mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and the child  --  reverend sir , what are the words of the Bible ? " " ' The sins of the father shall be visited upon the children to the third generation , ' " said Mr. Falsgrave , with some slight reluctance in his tones . " But Madam , that does not mean , that the community is in any way to take the infamy of the children into their own voluntary hands , as the conscious delegated stewards of God 's inscrutable dispensations . Because it is declared that the infamous consequences of sin shall be hereditary , it does not follow that our personal and active loathing of sin , should descend from the sinful sinner to his sinless child . " " I understand you , sir , " said Mrs. Glendinning , coloring slightly , " you think me too censorious . But if we entirely forget the parentage of the child , and every way receive the child as we would any other , feel for it in all . respects the same , and attach no sign of ignominy to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Do we not then put ourselves in the way of its fulfilment , and is that wholly free from impiety ? " Here it was the clergyman 's turn to color a little , and there was a just perceptible tremor of the under lip . " Pardon me , " continued the lady , courteously , " but if there is any one blemish in the character of the Reverend Mr. Falsgrave , it is that the benevolence of his heart , too much warps in him the holy rigor of our Church 's doctrines . For my part , as I loathe  | the man , I loathe the woman , and never desire to behold the A pause ensued , during which it was fortunate for Pierre , that by the social sorcery of such occasions as the present , the eyes of all three were intent upon the cloth ; all three for the moment , giving loose to their own distressful meditations upon the subject in debate , and Mr. Falsgrave vexedly thinking that the scene was becoming a little embarrassing . Pierre was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes away from both his auditors ; but though he did not designate his mother , something in the tone of his voice showed that what he said was addressed more particularly to her . " Since we seem to have been strangely drawn into the ethical aspect of this melancholy matter , " said he , " suppose we go further in it ; and let me ask , how it should be between the legitimate and the illegitimate child  --  children of one father  --  when they shall have passed their childhood ? " Here the clergyman quickly raising his eyes , looked as surprised and searchingly at Pierre , as his politeness would permit . " Upon my word , " ? said Mrs. Glendinning , hardly less surprised , and making no attempt at disguising it ? " this is an odd question you put ; you have been more attentive to the subject than I had fancied . But what do you mean , Pierre ? I did not entirely understand you . " " Should the legitimate child shun the illegitimate , when one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bending his head still further over his plate . The clergyman looked a little down again , and was silent ; hut still turned his head slightly sideways toward his hostess , as if awaiting some reply to Pierre from her . " Ask the world , Pierre " ? said Mrs. Glendinning warmly ? " and ask your own heart . " " My own heart ? I will , Madam " ? said Pierre , now looking up steadfastly ; " but what do you think , Mr. Falsgrave ? " letting his glance drop again ? " should the one shun the other ? should the one refuse his highest sympathy and perfect love for the other ,  | especially if that other be deserted by all the rest of the world ? What think you would have been our blessed Saviour 's thoughts on such a matter ? And what was that he so mildly said to the adulteress ? " A swift color passed over the clergyman 's countenance , suffusing even his expanded brow ; he slightly moved in his chair , and looked uncertainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrewd , benevolent-minded man , placed between opposite opinions  --  merely opinions  --  who , with a full , and doublydiffering persuasion in himself , still refrains from uttering it , because of an irresistible dislike to manifesting an absolute dissent from the honest convictions of any person , whom he both socially and morally esteems . " Well , what do you reply to my son ? " ? said Mrs. Glendinning at last . " Madam and sir " ? said the clergyman , now regaining his entire self-possession . " It is one of the social disadvantages which we of the pulpit labor under , that we are supposed to know more of the moral obligations of humanity than other people . And it is a still more serious disadvantage to the world , that our unconsidered , conversational opinions on the most complex problems of ethics , are too apt to be considered authoritative , as indirectly proceeding from the church itself . Now , nothing can be more erroneous than such notions ; and nothing so embarrasses me , and deprives me of that entire serenity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion on moral subjects , than when sudden questions of this sort are put to me in company . Pardon this long preamble , for I have little more to say . It is not every question , however direct , Mr. Glendinning , which can be conscientiously answered with a yes or no . Millions of circumstances modify all moral questions ; so that though conscience may possibly dictate freely in any known special case ; yet , by one universal maxim , to embrace all moral contingencies , this is not only impossible , but the attempt , to me , seems foolish . " At this instant , the surplice-like napkin dropped from the clergyman 's bosom , showing a minute but exquisitely cut cameo  | brooch , representing the allegorical union of the serpent and love . It had been the gift of an appreciative friend , and was sometimes worn on secular occasions like the present . " I agree with you , sir " ? said Pierre , bowing . " I fully agree with von . And now , Madam , let us talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punctiliously this morning , Mr. Glendinning " ? said his mother , half-bitterly smiling , and half-openly offended , but still more surprised at Pierre 's frigid demeanor . " Honor thy father and mother ' ; " said Pierre ? " both father and ' mother , " he unconsciously added . " And now that it strikes me , Mr. Falsgrave , and now that we have become so strangely polemical this morning , let me say , that as that command is justly said to be the only one with a promise , so it seems to be without any contingency in the application . It would seem ? would it not , sir ? ? that the most deceitful and hypocritical of lathers should be equally honored by the son , as the purest . " " So it would certainly seem , according to the strict letter of the Decalogue  --  certainly . " " And do you think , sir , that it should be so held , and so applied in actual life ? For instance , should I honor my father , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pierre ! Pierre ! " said his mother , profoundly coloring , and half rising ; " there is no need of these argumentative assumptions . You very immensely forget yourself this morning . " " It is merely the interest of the general question , Madam , " returned Pierre , coldly . " I am sorry . If your former objection does not apply here , Mr. Falsgrave , will you favor me with an answer to my question ? " " There you are again , Mr. Glendinning , " said the clergyman , thankful for Pierre 's hint ; " that is another question in morals absolutely incapable of a definite answer , which shall be universally applicable . " Again the surplice-like napkin chanced to drop . " I am tacitly rebuked again then , sir , " said Pierre , slowly ; " but I admit that perhaps you are again in the right . And now , Madam , since Mr. Falsgrave and yourself have a little business together , to which my presence is not necessary , and may possibly prove quite dispensable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | ing off on a long ramble , so you need not wait dinner for me . Good morning , Mr. Falsgrave ; good morning , Madam , " looking toward his mother . As the door closed upon him , Mr. Falsgrave spoke ? " Mr. Glendinning looks a little pale to-day : has he been ill ? " " Not that I know of , " answered the lady , indifferently , " but did you ever see young gentlemen so stately as he was ? Extraordinary ! " she murmured ; " what can this mean  --  Madam ? Madam ? But your cup is empty again , sir " ? reaching forth her hand . " No more , no more , Madam , " said the clergyman . " Madam ? Pray do n't Madam me any more , Mr. Falsgrave ; I have taken a sudden hatred to that title . " " Shall it be Your Majesty , then ? " said the clergyman , gallantly ; " the May Queens are so styled , and so should be the Queens of October . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said she , " let us go into another room , and settle the affair of that infamous Ned and that miserable Delly . " The swiftness and unrepellableness of the billow which , with its first shock , had so profoundly whelmed Pierre , had not only poured into his soul a tumult of entirely new images and emotions , but , for the time , it almost entirely drove out of him all previous ones . The things that any way bore directly upon the pregnant fact of Isabel , these things were all animate and vividly present to him ; but the things which bore more upon himself , and his own personal condition , as now forever involved with his sister 's , these things were not so animate and present to him . The conjectured past of Isabel took mysterious hold of his father ; therefore , the idea of his father tyrannized over his imagination ; and the possible future of Isabel , as so essentially though indirectly compromisable by whatever course of conduct his mother might hereafter ignorantly pursue with regard to himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; these considerations brought his mother with blazing prominence before him .  | Heaven , after all , bath been a little merciful to the miserable lean ; not entirely untempered to human nature are the most direful blasts of Fate . When on all sides assailed by prospects of disaster , whose final ends are in terror hidden from it , the soul of man  --  either , as instinctively convinced that it can not battle with the whole host at once ; or else , benevolently blinded to lie larger arc of the circle which menacingly hems it in ; ? whichever be the truth , the soul of man , thus surrounded , can not , and does never intelligently confront the totality of its wretchedness . The bitter drug is divided into separate draughts for him : to-day he takes one part of his woe ; to-morrow he takes more ; and so on , till the last drop is drunk . Not that in the despotism of other things , the thought of Lucy , and the unconjecturable suffering into which she might so soon be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his own future , as now in great part and at all hazards dedicated to Isabel ; not that this thought had thus far been alien to him . Icy-cold , and serpent-like , it had overlayingly crawled in upon his other shuddering imaginings ; but those other thoughts would as often upheave again , and absorb it into themselves , so that it would in that way soon disappear from his cotemporary apprehension . The prevailing thoughts connected with Isabel he now could front with prepared and open eyes ; but the occasional thought of Lucy , - when that started up before him , he could only cover his bewildered eyes with his bewildered hands . Nor was this the cowardice of selfishness , but the infinite sensitiveness of his soul . He could bear the agonizing thought of Isabel , because he was immediately resolved to help her , and to assuage a fellow-being 's grief ; but , as yet , he could not bear the thought of Lucy , because the very resolution that promised balm to Isabel obscurely involved the everlasting peace of Lucy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's happiness . Well for Pierre it was , that the penciling presentiments of his mind concerning Lucy as quickly erased as painted their tormenting images . Standing half-befogged upon the mountain of his Fate , all that part of the wide panorama was wrapped in clouds to him ; but anon those concealings slid aside , or rather ,  | a quick rent was made in them ; disclosing far below , halfveiled in the lower mist , the winding tranquil vale and stream of Lucy 's previous happy life ; through the swift cloud-rent he caught one glimpse of her expectant and angelic face peeping from the honey-suckled window of her cottage ; and the next instant the stormy pinions of the clouds locked themselves over it again ; and all was hidden as before ; and all went confused in whirling rack and vapor as before . Only by unconscious inspiration , caught from the agencies invisible to man , had he been enabled to write that first obscurely announcing note to Lucy ; wherein the collectedness , and the mildness , and the calmness , were but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bolts to follow . But , while thus , for the most part wrapped from his consciousness and vision , still , the condition of his Lucy , as so deeply affected now , was still more and more disentangling and defining itself from out its nearer mist , and even beneath the general upper fog . For when unfathomably stirred , the subtler elements of man do not always reveal themselves in the concocting act ; but , as with all other potencies , show themselves chiefly in their ultimate resolvings and results . Strange wild work , and awfully symmetrical and reciprocal , was that now going on within the self-apparently chaotic breast of Pierre . As in his own conscious determinations , the mournful Isabel was being snatched from her captivity of world-wide abandonment ; so , deeper down in the more secret chambers of his unsuspecting soul , the smiling Lucy , now as dead and ashy pale , was being bound a ransom for Isabel 's salvation . Eye for eye , and tooth for tooth . Eternally inexorable and unconcerned is Fate , a mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was this general and spontaneous self-concealment of all the most momentous interests of his love , as irretrievably involved with Isabel and his resolution respecting her ; nor was this unbidden thing in him unseconded by the prompting of his own conscious judgment , when in the tyranny of the masterevent itself , that judgment was permitted some infrequent play . He could not but be aware , that all meditation on Lucy now was worse than useless . How could he now map out his and  | her young life-chart , when all was yet misty-white with creamy breakers ! Still more : divinely dedicated as he felt himself to be ; with divine commands upon him to befriend and champion Isabel , through all conceivable contingencies of Time and Chance ; how could he insure himself against the insidious inroads of self-interest , and hold intact all his unselfish magnanimities , if once he should permit the distracting thought of Lucy to dispute with Isabel 's the pervading possession of his soul ? And if  --  though but unconsciously as yet  --  he was almost superhumanly prepared to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut himself away from his last hopes of common happiness , should they cross his grand enthusiast resolution ; ? if this was so with him ; then , how light as gossamer , and thinner and more impalpable than airiest threads of gauze , did he hold all common conventional regardings ; ? his hereditary duty to his mother , his pledged worldly faith and honor to the hand and seal of his affiancement ? Not that at present all these things did thus present themselves to Pierre ; but these things were feetally forming in him . Impregnations from high enthusiasms he had received ; and the now incipient offspring which so stirred , with such painful , vague vibrations in his soul ; this , in its mature development , when it should at last come forth in living deeds , would scorn all personal relationship with Pierre , and hold his heart 's dearest interests for naught . Thus , in the Enthusiast to Duty , the heaven-begotten Christ is born ; and will not own a mortal parent , and spurns and rends all mortal bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the one ensuing evening had been given to Pierre to prepare for the momentous interview with Isabel . Now , thank God , thought Pierre , the night is past , the night of Chaos and of Doom ; the day only , and the skirt of evening now remain . May heaven new-string my soul , and confirm me in the Christ-like feeling I first felt . May I , in all my least shape-  | ful thoughts still square myself by the inflexible rule of holy right . Let no unmanly , mean temptation cross my path this day ; let no base stone lie in it . This day I will forsake the censuses of men , and seek the suffrages of the god-like population of the trees , which now seem to me a nobler race than man . Their high foliage shall drop heavenliness upon me ; my feet in contact with their mighty roots , immortal vigor shall so steal into me . Guide me , gird me , guard me , this day , ye sovereign powers ! Bind me in bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ; eternally this day deface in me the detested and distorted images of all the convenient lies and duty-subterfuges of the diving and ducking moralities of this earth . Fill me with consuming fire for them ; to my life 's muzzle , cram me with your own intent . Let no world-syren come to sing to me this day , and wheedle from me my undauntedness . I cast my eternal die this day , ye powers . On my strong faith in ye Invisibles , I stake three whole felicities , and three whole lives this day . If ye forsake me now , ? farewell to Faith , farewell to Truth , farewell to God ; exiled for aye from God and man , I shall declare myself an equal power with both ; free to make war on Night and Day , and all thoughts and things of mind and matter , which the upper and the nether firmaments do clasp ! But Pierre , though charged with the fire of all divineness , his containing thing was made of clay . Ah , muskets the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made them of clay ! Save me from being hound to Truth , liege lord , as I am now . How shall I steal yet further into Pierre , and show how this heavenly fire was helped to be contained in him , by mere contingent things , and things that he knew not . But I shall follow the endless , winding way , ? the flowing river in the cave of man ; careless whither I be led , reckless where I land . Was not the face  --  though mutely mournful  --  beautiful , bewitchingly ? How unfathomable those most wondrous eyes of supernatural light ! In those charmed depths , Grief and Beauty plunged and dived together . So beautiful , so mystical , so bewilderingly alluring ; speaking of a mournfulness infinitely  | sweeter and more attractive than all mirthfulness ; that face of glorious suffering ; that face of touching loveliness ; that face was Pierre 's own sister 's ; that face was Isabel 's ; that face Pierre had visibly seen ; into those same supernatural eyes our Pierre had looked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was assured that , in a transcendent degree , womanly beauty , and not womanly ugliness , invited him to champion the right . Be naught concealed in this book of sacred truth . How , if accosted in some squalid lane , a humped , and crippled , hideous girl should have snatched his garment 's hem , with ? " Save me , Pierre  --  love me , own me , brother ; I am thy sister ! " ? Ah , if man were wholly made in heaven , why catch we hell-glimpses ? Why in the noblest marble pillar that stands beneath the all-comprising vault , ever should we descry the sinister vein ? We lie in nature very close to God ; and though , further on , the stream may be corrupted by the banks it flows through ; yet at the fountain 's rim , where mankind stand , there the stream infallibly bespeaks the fountain . So let no censorious word be here hinted of mortal Pierre . Easy for me to slyly hide these things , and always put him before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitable nature and the lot of common men . I am more frank with Pierre than the best men are with themselves . I am all unguarded and magnanimous with Pierre ; therefore you see his weakness , and therefore only . In reserves men build imposing characters ; not in revelations . He who shall be wholly honest , though nobler than Ethan Allen ; that man shall stand in danger of the meanest mortal 's scorn .  | RALF wishful that the hour would come ; half shuddering that every moment it still came nearer and more near to him ; dryeyed , but wet with that dark day 's rain ; at fall of eve , Pierre emerged from long wanderings in the primeval woods of Saddle Meadows , and for one instant stood motionless upon their sloping skirt . Where he stood was in the rude wood road , only used by sledges in the time of snow ; just where the out-posted trees formed a narrow arch , and fancied gateway leading upon the far , wide pastures sweeping down toward the lake . In that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed standing in a world inhospitable , yet rooted by inscrutable sense of duty to their place . Beyond , the lake lay in one sheet of blankness and of dumbness , unstirred by breeze or breath ; fast bound there it lay , with not life enough to reflect the smallest shrub or twig . Yet in that lake was seen the duplicate , stirless sky above . Only in sunshine did that lake catch gay , green images ; and these but displaced the imaged muteness of the unfeatured heavens . On both sides , in the remoter distance , and also far beyond the mild lake 's further shore , rose the long , mysterious mountain masses ; shaggy with pines and hemlocks , mystical with nameless , vapory exhalations , and in that dim air black with dread  | and gloom . At their base , profoundest forests lay entranced , and from their far owl-haunted depths of caves and rotted leaves , and unused and unregarded inland overgrowth of decaying wood  --  for smallest sticks of which , in other climes many a pauper was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profoundest forests , came a moaning , muttering , roaring , intermitted , changeful sound : rain-shakings of the palsied trees , slidings of rocks undermined , final crashings of long-riven boughs , and devilish gibberish of the forest-ghosts . But more near , on the mild lake 's hither shore , where it formed a long semi-circular and scooped acclivity of corn-fields , there the small and low red farm-house lay ; its ancient roof a bed of brightest mosses ; its north front ( from the north the moss-wind blows ) , also moss-incrusted , like the north side of any vast-trunked maple in the groves . At one gabled end , a tangled arbor claimed support , and paid for it by generous gratuities of broad-flung verdure , one viny shaft of which pointed itself upright against the chimney-bricks , as if a waving lightning-rod . Against the other gable , you saw the lowly dairy-shed ; its sides close netted with traced Madeira vines ; and had you been close enough , peeping through that imprisoning tracery , and through the light slats barring the little embrasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and contented captives  --  the pans of milk , and the snow-white Dutch cheeses in a row , and the molds of golden butter , and the jars of lily cream . In front , three straight gigantic lindens stood guardians of this verdant spot . A long way up , almost to the ridgepole of the house , they showed little foliage ; but then , suddenly , as three huge green balloons , they poised their three vast , inverted , rounded cones of verdure in the air . Soon as Pierre 's eye rested on the place , a tremor shook him . Not alone because of Isabel , as there a harborer now , but because of two dependent and most strange coincidences which that day 's experience had brought to him . He had gone to breakfast with his mother , his heart charged to overflowing with presentiments of what would probably be her haughty disposition concerning such a being as Isabel , claiming her maternal love : and lo ! the Reverend Mr. Falsgrave enters , and Ned and  | Deily are discussed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing before his mother in all its ethic bearings , so as absolutely to learn her thoughts upon it , and thereby test his own conjectures ; all that matter had been fully talked about ; so that , through that strange coincidence , he now perfectly knew his mother 's mind , and had received forewarnings , as if from heaven , not to make any present disclosure to her . That was in the morning ; and now , at eve catching a glimpse of the house where Isabel was harboring , at once he recognized it as the rented farm-house of old Walter Ulver , father to the self-same Deily , forever ruined through the cruel arts of Ned . Strangest feelings , almost supernatural , now stole into Pierre . With little power to touch with awe the souls of less susceptible , reflective , and poetic beings , such coincidences , however frequently they may recur , ever fill the finer organization with sensations which transcend all verbal renderings . They take hold of life 's subtlest problem . With the lightning 's flash , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If too , the mind thus influenced be likewise a prey to any settled grief , then on all sides the query magnifies , and at last takes in the all-comprehending round of things . For ever is it seen , that sincere souls in suffering , then most ponder upon final causes . The heart , stirred to its depths , finds correlative sympathy in the head , which likewise is profoundly moved . Before miserable men , when intellectual , all the ages of the world pass as in a manacled procession , and all their myriad links rattle in the mournful mystery . Pacing beneath the long-skirting shadows of the elevated wood , waiting for the appointed hour to come , Pierre strangely strove to imagine to himself the scene which was destined to ensue . But imagination utterly failed him here ; the reality was too real for him ; only the face , the face alone now visited him ; and so accustomed had he been of late to confound it with the shapes of air , that he almost trembled when he thought that face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And now the thicker shadows begin to fall ; the place is lost to him ; only the three dim , tall lindens pilot him as he descends  | the hill , hovering upon the house . He knows it not , but his meditative route is sinuous ; as if that moment his thought 's stream was likewise serpentining : laterally obstructed by insinuated misgivings as to the ultimate utilitarian advisability of the enthusiast resolution that was his . His steps decrease in quickness as he comes more nigh , and sees one feeble light struggling in the rustic double casement . Infallibly he knows that his own voluntary steps are taking him forever from the brilliant chandeliers of the mansion of Saddle Meadows , to join company with the wretched rush-lights of poverty and woe . But his sublime intuitiveness also paints to him the sun-like glories of godlike truth and virtue ; which though ever obscured by the dense fogs of earth , still shall shine eventually in unclouded radiance , casting illustrative light upon the sapphire throne of God , He stands before the door ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the casement light flickers for a moment , and then moves away ; within , he hears a door creak on its hinges ; then his whole heart beats wildly as the outer latch is lifted ; and holding the light above her supernatural head , Isabel stands before him . It is herself . No word is spoken ; no other soul is seen . They enter the room of the double casement ; and Pierre sits down , overpowered with bodily faintness and spiritual awe . He lifts his eyes to Isabel 's gaze of loveliness and loneliness ; and , then a low , sweet , half-sobbing voice of more than natural musicalness is heard : " And so , thou art my brother ; ? shall I call thee Pierre ? " Steadfastly , with his one first and last fraternal inquisition of the person of the mystic girl , Pierre now for an instant eyes her ; and in that one instant sees in the imploring face , not only the nameless touchingness of that of the sewing-girl , but also the subtler expression of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and intermarryingly blended with some before unknown , foreign feminineness . In one breath , Memory and Prophecy , and Intuition tell him ? " Pierre , have no reserves ; no minutest possible doubt ; ? this being is thy sister ; thou gazest on thy father 's flesh . "  | " And so thou art my brother ? ? shall I call thee Pierre ? " He sprang to his feet , and caught her in his undoubting arms . " Thou art ! thou art ! " He felt a faint struggling within his clasp ; her head drooped against him ; his whole form was bathed in the flowing glossiness of her long and unimprisoned hair . Brushing the locks aside , he now gazed upon the death-like beauty of the face , and caught immortal sadness from it . She seemed as dead ; as suffocated , ? the death that leaves most unimpaired the latent tranquillities and sweetnesses of the human countenance . He would have called aloud for succor ; but the slow eyes opened upon him ; and slowly he felt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself a little , ? and again he feels her faintly struggling in his arms , as if somehow abashed , and incredulous of mortal right to hold her so . Now Pierre repents his over-ardent and incautious warmth , and feels himself all reverence for her . Tenderly he leads her to a bench within the double casement ; and sits beside her ; and waits in silence , till the first shock of this encounter shall have left her more composed and more prepared to hold communion with him . " How feel'st thou now , my sister ? " " Bless thee ! bless thee ! " Again the sweet , wild power of the musicalness of the voice , and some soft , strange touch of foreignness in the accent , so it fancifully seemed to Pierre , thrills through and through his soul . He bent and kissed her brow ; and then feels her hand seeking his , and then clasping it without one uttered word . All his being is now condensed in that one sensation of the clasping hand . He feels it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he knew that by the lonely labor of her hands , his own father 's daughter had earned her living in the same world , where he himself , her own brother , had so idly dwelled . Once more he reverently kissed her brow , and his warm breath against it murmured with a prayer to heaven . " I have no tongue to speak to thee , Pierre , my brother . My whole being , all my life 's thoughts and longings are in endless arrears to thee ; then how can I speak to thee ? Were it God 's  | will , Pierre , my utmost blessing now , were to lie down and die . Then should I be at peace . Bear with me , Pierre . " " Eternally will I do that , my beloved Isabel ! Speak not to me yet awhile , if that seemeth best to thee , if that only is possible to thee . This thy clasping hand , my sister , this is now thy tongue to me . " " I know not where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet my soul o'erbrims in me . " " From my heart 's depths , I love and reverence thee ; and feel for thee , backward and forward , through all eternity ! " " Oh , Pierre , canst thou not cure in me this dreaminess , this bewilderingness I feel ? My poor head swims and swims , and will not pause . My life can not last long thus ; I am too full without discharge . Conjure tears for me , Pierre ; that my heart may not break with the present feeling , ? more death-like to me than all my grief gone by ! " " Ye thirst-slaking evening skies , ye hilly dews and mists , distill your moisture here ! The bolt hath passed ; why comes not , the following shower ? ? Make her to weep ! " Then her head sought his support ; and big drops fell on him ; ' and anon , Isabel gently slid her head from him , and sat a little composedly beside him . " If thou feelest in endless arrears of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel toward thee . I too , scarce know what I . should speak to thee . But when thou lookest on me , my sister , thou beholdest one , who in his soul hath taken vows immutable , to be to thee , in all respects , and to the uttermost bounds and possibilities of Fate , thy protecting and all-acknowledging brother ! " " Not mere sounds of common words , but inmost tones of my heart 's deepest melodies should now be audible to thee . Thou speakest to a human thing , but something heavenly should answer thee ; ? some flute heard in the air should answer thee ; for sure thy most undreamed-of accents , Pierre , sure they have not been unheard on high . Blessings that are imageless to all mortal fancyings , these shall be thine for this . " " Blessing like to thine , doth but recoil and bless homeward to the heart that uttered it . I can not bless thee , my sister , as thou  | dost bless thyself in blessing my unworthiness . But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our meeting , we shall make our hearts all feebleness . Let me then rehearse to thee what Pierre is ; what life hitherto he hath been leading ; and what hereafter he shall lead ; ? so thou wilt be prepared . " " Nay , Pierre , that is my office ; thou art first entitled to my tale , then , if it suit thee , thou shalt make me the unentitled gift of thine . Listen to me , now . The invisible things will give me strength ; ? it is not much , Pierre ; ? nor aught very marvelous . Listen then ; ? I feel soothed down to utterance now . " During some brief , interluding , silent pauses in their interview thus far , Pierre had heard a soft , slow , sad , to-and-fro , meditative stepping on the floor above ; and in the frequent pauses that intermitted the strange story in the following chapter , that same soft , slow , sad , to-and-fro , meditative , and most melancholy stepping , was again and again audible in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother . The farthest stretch of my life 's memory can not recall one single feature of such a face . If , indeed , mother of mine bath lived , she is long gone , and east no shadow on the ground she trod . Pierre , the lips that do now speak to thee , never touched a woman 's breast ; I seem not of woman born . My first dim life-thoughts cluster round an old , half-ruinous house in some region , for which I now have no chart to seek it out . If such a spot did ever really exist , that too seems to have been withdrawn from all the remainder of the earth . It was a wild , dark house , planted in the midst of a round , cleared , deeply-sloping space , scooped out of the middle of deep stunted pine woods . Ever I shrunk at evening from peeping out of my window , lest the ghostly pines should steal near to me , and reach out their grim arms to snatch me into their horrid shadows . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds and beasts . In winter its deep snows were traced like any paper map , with dotting night-tracks of four-footed creatures , that , even to the sun , were never visible , and never were seen by man at all . In the  | round open space the dark house stood , without one single green twig or leaf to shelter it ; shadeless and shelterless in the heart of shade and shelter . Some of the windows were rudely boarded up , with boards nailed straight up and down ; and those rooms were utterly empty , and never were entered , though they were doorless . But often , from the echoing corridor , I gazed into them with fear ; for the great fire-places were all in ruins ; the lower tier of back-stones were burnt into one white , common crumbling ; and the black bricks above had fallen upon the hearths , heaped here and there with the still falling soot of longextinguished fires . Every hearth-stone in that house had one long crack through it ; every floor drooped at the corners ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it rested on the low foundation of greenish stones , was strewn with dull , yellow molderings of the rotting sills . No name ; no scrawled or written thing ; no book , was in the house ; no one memorial speaking of its former occupants . It was dumb as death . No grave-stone , or mound , or any little hillock around the house , betrayed any past burials of man or child . And thus , with no trace then to me of its past history , thus it hath now entirely departed and perished from my slightest knowledge as to where that house so stood , or in what region it so stood . None other house like it have I ever seen . But once I saw plates of the outside of French chateaux which powerfully recalled its dim image to me , especially the two rows of small dormer windows projecting from the inverted hopper-roof . But that house was of wood , and these of stone . Still , sometimes I think that house was not in this country , but somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all bewildering to me ; and so you must not start at me , for I can not but talk wildly upon so wild a theme . " In this house I never saw any living human soul , but an old man and woman . The old man 's face was almost black with age , and was one purse of wrinkles , his hoary beard , always tangled , streaked with dust and earthy crumbs . I think in summer he toiled a little in the garden , or some spot like that , which lay on one side of the house . All my ideas are in uncertainty and confusion here . But the old man and the old woman seem to have fastened themselves indelibly upon my memory . I suppose  | their being the only human things around me then , that caused the hold they took upon me . They seldom spoke to me ; but would sometimes , of dark , gusty nights , sit by the fire and stare at me , and then mumble to each other , and then stare at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but , I repeat , they seldom or never spoke to me . What words or language they used to each other , this it is impossible for me to recall . I have often wished to ; for then I might at least have some additional idea whether the house was in this country or somewhere beyond the sea . And here I ought to say , that sometimes I have , I know not what sort of vague remembrances of at one time ? shortly after the period I now speak of  --  chattering in two different childish languages ; one of which waned in me as the other and latter grew . But more of this anon . It was the woman that gave me my meals ; for I did not eat with them . Once they sat by the fire with a loaf between them , and a bottle of some thin sort of reddish wine ; and I went up to them , and asked to eat with them , and touched the loaf . But instantly the old man made a motion as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman , glaring at me , snatched the loaf and threw it into the fire before them . I ran frightened from the room ; and sought a cat , which I had often tried to coax into some intimacy , but , for some strange cause , without success . But in my frightened loneliness , then , I sought the cat again , and found her up-stairs , softly scratching for some hidden thing among the litter of the abandoned fire-places . I called to her , for I dared not go into the haunted chamber ; but she only gazed sideways and unintelligently toward me ; and continued her noiseless searchings . I called again , and then she turned round and hissed at me ; and I ran down-stairs , still stung with the thought of having been driven away there , too . I now knew not where to go to rid myself of my loneliness . At last I went outside of the house , and sat down on a stone , but its coldness went up to my heart , and I rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dizzy ; I could not stand ; I fell , and knew no more . But next morning I found myself in bed in my uncheerable room , and some dark bread and a cup of water by me . " It has only been by chance that I have told thee this one  | particular reminiscence of my early life in that house . I could tell many more like it , but this is enough to show what manner of life I led at that time . Every day that I then lived , I felt all visible sights and all audible sounds growing stranger and stranger , and fearful and more fearful to me . To me the man and the woman were just like the cat ; none of them would speak to me ; none of them were comprehensible to me . And the man , and the woman , and the cat , were just like the green foundation stones of the house to me ; I knew not whence they came , or what cause they had for being there . I say again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man and the woman ; but sometimes the old man early trudged away to a road that led through the woods , and would not come back till late in the evening ; he brought the dark bread , and the thin , reddish wine with him . Though the entrance to the wood was not so very far from the door , yet he came so slowly and infirmly trudging with his little load , that it seemed weary hours on hours between my first descrying him among the trees , and his crossing the splintered threshold . " Now the wide and vacant blurrings of my early life thicken in my mind . All goes wholly memoryless to me now . It may have been that about that time I grew sick with some fever , in which for a long interval I lost myself . Or it may be true , which I have heard , that after the period of our very earliest recollections , then a space intervenes of entire unknowingness , followed again by the first dim glimpses of the succeeding memory , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one early gap in it . " However this may be , nothing more can I recall of the house in the wide open space ; nothing of how at last I came to leave it ; but I must have been still extremely young then . But some uncertain , tossing memory have I of being at last in another round , open space , but immensely larger than the first one , and with no encircling belt of woods . Yet often it seems to me that there were three tall , straight things like pine-trees somewhere there nigh to me at times ; and that they fearfully shook and snapped as the old trees used to in the mountain storms . And the floors seemed sometimes to droop at the corners still  | more steeply than the old floors did ; and changefully drooped too , so that I would even seem to feel them drooping under me . " Now , too , it was that , as it sometimes seems to me , I first and last chattered in the two childish languages I spoke of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some of whom talked one , and some the other ; but I talked both ; yet one not so readily as the other ; and but beginningly as it were ; still this other was the one which was gradually displacing the former . The men who  --  as it sometimes dreamily seems to me at times ? often climbed the three strange treelike things , they talked ? I needs must think  --  if indeed I have any real thought about so bodiless a phantom as this is  --  they talked the language which I speak of as at this time gradually waning in me . It was a bonny tongue ; oh , seems to me so sparkling-gay and lightsome ; just the tongue for a child like me , if the child had not been so sad always . It was pure children 's language , Pierre ; so twittering ? such a chirp . " In thy own mind , thou must now perceive , that most of these dim remembrances in me , hint vaguely of a ship at sea . But all is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any time whether I tell you real things , or the unrealest dreams . Always in me , the solidest things melt into dreams , and dreams into solidities . Never have I wholly recovered from the effects of my strange early life . This it is , that even now  --  this moment ? surrounds thy visible form , my brother , with a mysterious mistiness ; so that a second face , and a third face , and a fourth face peep at me from within thy own . Now dim , and more dim , grows in me all the memory of how thou and I did come to meet . I go groping again amid all sorts of shapes , which part to me ; so that I seem to advance through the shapes ; and yet the shapes have eyes that look at me . I turn round , and they look at me ; I step forward , and they look at me. ? Let me be silent now ; do not speak to me . " Filled with nameless wonderings at this strange being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her immense soft tresses of the jettiest hair had slantingly fallen over  | her as though a curtain were half drawn from before some saint enshrined . To Pierre , she seemed half unearthly ; but this unearthliness was only her mysteriousness , not any thing that was repelling or menacing to him . And still , the low melodies of her far interior voice hovered in sweet echoes in the room ; and were trodden upon , and pressed like gushing grapes , by the steady invisible pacing on the floor above . She moved a little now , and after some strange wanderings more coherently continued . " My next memory which I think I can in some degree rely upon , was yet another house , also situated away from human haunts , in the heart of a not entirely silent country . Through this country , and by the house , wound a green and lagging river . That house must have been in some lowland ; for the first house I spoke of seems to me to have been somewhere among mountains , or near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I seem to hear them now ; the steady up-pointed cloudshapes behind the house in the sunset sky  --  I seem to see them now . But this other house , this second one , or third one , I know not which , I say again it was in some lowland . There were no pines around it ; few trees of any sort ; the ground did not slope so steeply as around the first house . There were cultivated fields about it , and in the distance farm-houses and outhouses , and cattle , and fowls , and many objects of that familiar sort . This house I am persuaded was in this country ; on this side of the sea . It was a very large house , and full of people ; but for the most part they lived separately . There were some old people in it , and there were young men , and young women in it , ? some very handsome ; and there were children in it . It seemed a happy place to some of these people ; many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a happy place for me . " But here I may err , because of my own consciousness I can not identify in myself  --  I mean in the memory of my whole foregoing life , ? I say , I can not identify that thing which is called happiness ; that thing whose token is a laugh , or a smile , or a silent serenity on the lip . I may have been happy , but it is not in my conscious memory now . Nor do I feel a longing for it , as though I had never had it ; my spirit seeks different food from  | happiness ; for I think I have a suspicion of what it is . I have suffered wretchedness , but not because of the absence of happiness , and without praying for happiness . I pray for peace  --  for motionlessness  --  for the feeling of myself , as of some plant , absorbing life without seeking it , and existing without individual sensation . I feel that there can be no perfect peace in individualness . Therefore , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pervading spirit animating all things . I feel I am an exile here . I still go straying. ? Yes ; in thy speech , thou smilest. ? But let me be silent again . Do not answer me . When I resume , I will not wander so , but make short end . " Reverently resolved not to offer the slightest let or hinting hindrance to the singular tale rehearsing to him , but to sit passively and receive its marvelous droppings into his soul , however long the pauses ; and as touching less mystical considerations , persuaded that by so doing he should ultimately derive the least nebulous and imperfect account of Isabel 's history ; Pierre still sat waiting her resuming , his eyes fixed upon the girl 's wonderfully beautiful ear , which chancing to peep forth from among her abundant tresses , nestled in that blackness like a transparent sea-shell of pearl . She moved a little now ; and after some strange wanderings more coherently continued ; while the sound of the stepping on the floor above  --  it seemed to cease . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third spot in my memory of the past , as it first appeared to me ; I mean , I have spoken of the people in the house , according to my very earliest recallable impression of them . But I stayed in that house for several years  --  five , six , perhaps , seven years  --  and during that interval of my stay , all things changed to me , because I learned more , though always dimly . Some of its occupants departed ; some changed from smiles to tears ; some went moping all the day ; some grew as savages and outrageous , and were dragged below by dumb-like men into deep places , that I knew nothing of , but dismal sounds came through the lower floor , groans and clanking fallings , as of iron in straw . Now and then , I saw coffins silently at noon-day carried into the house , and in five minutes ' time emerge again , seemingly heavier than they entered ; but  | I saw not who was in them . Once , I saw an immense-sized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who did not speak ; and watching , I saw it pushed out again , and they drove off with it . But the numbers of those invisible persons who thus departed from the house , were made good by other invisible persons arriving in close carriages . Some in rags and tatters came on foot , or rather were driven on foot . Once I heard horrible outcries , and peeping from my window , saw a robust but squalid and distorted man , seemingly a peasant , tied by cords with four long ends to them , held behind by as many ignorant-looking men who with a lash drove the wild squalid being that way toward the house . Then I heard answering hand-clappings , shrieks , howls , laughter , blessings , prayers , oaths , hymns , and all audible confusions issuing from all the chambers of the house . " Sometimes there entered the house  --  though only transiently , departing within the hour they came  --  people of a then remarkable aspect to me . They were very composed of countenance ; did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not make strange faces ; did not look endlessly fatigued ; were not strangely and fantastically dressed ; in short , did not at all resemble any people I had ever seen before , except a little like some few of the persons of the house , who seemed to have authority over the rest . These people of a remarkable aspect to me , I thought they were strangely demented people ; ? composed of countenance , but wandering of mind ; soul-composed and bodily-wandering , and strangely demented people . " By-and-by , the house seemed to change again , or else my mind took in more , and modified its first impressions . I was lodged up-stairs in a little room ; there was hardly any furniture in the room ; sometimes I wished to go out of it ; but the door was locked . Sometimes the people came and took me out of the room , into a much larger and very long room , and here I would collectively see many of the other people of the house , who seemed likewise brought from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would vacantly roam about , and talk vacant talk to each other . Some would stand in the middle of the room gazing steadily on the floor for hours together , and  | never stirred , but only breathed and gazed upon the floor . Some would sit crouching in the corner , and sit crouching there , and only breathe and crouch in the corners . Some kept their hands tight on their hearts , and went slowly promenading up and down , moaning and moaning to themselves . One would say to another  --  Teel of it  --  here , put thy hand in the break . ' Another would mutter ? ' Broken , broken , broken ? ' and would mutter nothing but that one word broken . But most of them were dumb , and could not , or would not speak , or had forgotten how to speak . They were nearly all pale people . Some had hair white as snow , and yet were quite young people . Some were always talking about Hell , Eternity , and God ; and some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this , and then they would argue , but without much conviction either way . But once nearly all the people present  --  even the dumb moping people , and the sluggish persons crouching in the corners  --  nearly all of them laughed once , when after a whole day 's loud babbling , two of these predestinarian opponents , said each to the other ? Thou last convinced me , friend ; but we are quits ; for so also , have I convinced thee , the other way ; now then , let 's argue it all over again ; for still , though mutually converted , we are still at odds . ' Some harangued the wall ; some apostrophized the air ; some hissed at the air ; some lolled their tongues out at the air ; some struck the air ; some made motions , as if wrestling with the air , and fell out of the arms of the air , panting from the invisible hug . " Now , as in the former thing , thou must , ere this , have suspected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that I then lived in . But do not speak the word to me . That word has never passed my lips ; even now , when I hear the word , I run from it ; when I see it printed in a book , I run from the book . The word is wholly unendurable to me . Who brought me to the house ; how I came there , I do not know . I lived a long time in the house ; that alone I know ; I say I know , but still I am uncertain ; still Pierre , still the  --  oh the dreaminess , the bewilderingness  --  it never entirely leaves me . Let me be still again . " She leaned away from him ; she put her small hard hand to  | her forehead ; then moved it down , very slowly , but still hardly over her eyes , and kept it there , making no other sign , and still as death . Then she moved and continued her vague tale of terribleness . " I must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mere offshootings of my story , here and there ; but the dreaminess I speak of leads me sometimes ; and I , as impotent then , obey the dreamy prompting . Bear with me ; now I will be briefer . " It came to pass , at last , that there was a contention about me in the house ; some contention which I heard in the after rumor only , not at the actual time . Some strangers had arrived ; or had come in haste , being sent for to the house . Next day they dressed me in new and pretty , but still plain clothes , and they took me down-stairs , and out into the air , and into a carriage with a pleasant-looking woman , a stranger to me ; and I was driven off a good way , two days nearly we drove away , stopping somewhere over-night ; and on the evening of the second day we came to another house , and went into it , and stayed there . " This house was a much smaller one than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . There was a beautiful infant in it ; and this beautiful infant always archly and innocently smiling on me , and strangely beckoning me to come and play with it , and be glad with it ; and be thoughtless , and be glad and gleeful with it ; this beautiful infant first brought me to my own mind , as it were ; first made me sensible that I was something different from stones , trees , cats ; first undid in me the fancy that all people were as stones , trees , cats ; first filled me with the sweet idea of humanness ; first made me aware of the infinite mercifulness , and tenderness , and beautifulness of humanness ; and this beautiful infant first filled me with the dim thought of Beauty ; and equally , and at the same time , with the feeling of the Sadness ; of the immortalness and universalness of the Sadness . I now feel that I should soon have gone , ? stop me now ; do not let me go that way . I owe all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envied it , lying in its happy mother 's breast , and drawing life and gladness , and all its perpetual smilingness from that white and smiling breast . That infant saved
