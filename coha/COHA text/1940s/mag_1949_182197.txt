One guarded paragraph , worded in the Stiffest gobbledygook , set off a loud crackle of scientific and near-scientific speculation last week . In his report on unification of the services , Secretary of Defense Forrestal said : <P> " The earth satellite vehicle program , which was being carried out independently by each military service , was assigned to the Committee on Guided Missiles for coordination . . . The committee recommended that current efforts in this field be limited to studies and component designs ; well-defined areas of such research have been allocated to each of the three military departments . " <P> The military refused to say more . Thus , the public was left to its own wild guessing whether the " satellite vehicles " were to be " inhabited " or " uninhabited , " and whether they were to serve as rocket-launching platforms or observation posts . <P> Forever Falling . Artificial satellites have been studied by space-navigation enthusiasts , both scientists and crackpots , for generations . Their basic theory is fairly simple . If a projectile is fired horizontally from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a curve . The greater the projectile 's speed , the flatter the-curve of its fall . When the curve gets flat enough , it is a circle matching the curve of the earth 's surface . Thus ( but for air friction ) , the projectile might continue forever , round &; round the earth . It would still be falling , but the surface of the earth would recede exactly as fast as the fall of the projectile . <P> In practice , air friction can not be ignored . No sizable projectile has ever approached the necessary speed ( about five miles a second ) which would whirl it around the earth in about 100 minutes . Even the latest rockets do not carry enough fuel to get well above the atmosphere ( some 500 miles ) and settle into orbits . But atomic-powered rockets might theoretically do it . An atomic rocket motor might be one of the " components " that Forrestal 's men are working on . <P> Down from the Orbit . They will have to work on a lot more components too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . Though bristling with difficulties , they are theoretically feasible enough to merit serious investigation . If they ever do carry U.S. colors into space , they would have their military uses . Even an uninhabited satellite could serve as an observation post . While orbiting over enemy territory , it might watch behind the lines with telescopes and report its observations by television . <P> Dropping bombs from a satellite would present problems . Ordinary bombs released from the bomb bay would merely follow along the orbit like smaller satellites . They would have to be shot downward to increase their falling rate and allow them to catch up with the curving surface of the earth . Shooting them backward would have a similar effect . If they were shot backward at a speed equal to the satellite 's forward speed on its orbit , they would stand still in space for an instant . Then they would fall vertically toward the earth . The whole satellite could be brought down on a target in either of these ways by giving it a powerful push from its nuclear rocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precision , the bomb could as well fall on Moscow , Idaho , as on Moscow , Russia .
